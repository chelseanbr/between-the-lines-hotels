She was unbelievable in making sure our reservation was spot on (we had 3 rooms and wanted them together). Her responses to my emails etc was truly above and beyond. It is the BEST experience I have ever had when making a hotel reservation and she is a true ambassador on behalf of the hotel.Secondly, the rooms. We normally stay at the Moana Surfrider in one of their suites but no more. We stayed in the newly renovated suite with adjoining rooms on level 17 of the Kealohilani tower (closest to the beach). The room was huge with not 1 but 3 balconies. We had 2 x toilets, 2 x baths and a huge living area. The views over Waikiki beach especially at sunset were picture perfect. We got plenty of sun and the rooms were just fantastic. Again I would prefer these suites compared to the Moans Surfrider suites.The Moana Terrace is perhaps the best spot to watch the sunset over a drink. I am a very keen photographer and visited a number of other locations ie Tiki Bar, The Deck etc, but the Moana Terrace was the best. The food and drinks were reasonable. The Kealohilani pool deck area is being renovated and closed on the last day we were there. There is a second pool on the same level (level 3) located in the other tower. this had just been renovated and was great.D.K. Steakhouse in the hotel is the best steakhouse in Waikiki by far.If you are wondering why I have not given the hotel 5 x stars is because of the reception staff. Upon arrival, their internet was down so we could not check in and we had to wait. Also I had issues with the bill which took ages to remedy - hence the 4 star rating.I must also mention ""buster"" who helped with our bags. What a great ambassador of the hotel. Both my wife and I were left amazed by his zest for life, his passion for his job and love of the hotel. Both him and Marian are a credit to the Marriott name.I would highly recommend staying at the hotel (Kealohilani tower) for the following reasons:Huge roomsGreat viewsNewly renovatedGreat locationGreat restaurants in the hotelABC shop in the foyerGreat Pool Bar and Terrace andGreat sunset views","Sydney, Australia","SydneyTraveller_2008</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",270,4.0

I got a room with a nice balcony view of Diamond Head but was hoping for a water view. Also put in the tower near the beach. The hotel is so large that you don't get that personal touch from other Marriott properties. Surprisingly, I found the Hilton Hawaiian Village more accommodating when I checked out and moved to my new hotel. This property has so much potential but I found better options elsewhere.The pros: if you have free breakfast included, the Kuhio Grill was amazing. Get there early because it does fill up quickly. So many food options and very friendly staff. The rooms are comfortable and the heated toilet bidet seats was a nice touch. There's a Dominos across the street if you're trying to cut back on costs. I took the Roberts Hawaii shuttle from the airport and it was only $17 for one way (unlike $30+ for a taxi/uber). Very comfy ride and to my delight, my hotel was the only one for drop-off.The cons: Customer service needs improvement; wish Concierge was more easily available to assist with activities and information; Elevators can get really crowded so be patient; everything is expensive around the hotel, so ABC stores will be your best friend.

I had messaged earlier that our flight was only landing at 9pm and would only get there around 10. I got a confirmation that it was received. When we arrived, they did not have our room available and they had to put us in a 2 double bed room as they did not have any rooms available for a 1 bed room. They would need to check us into the room and check us out the next day. Since it was so late and not sure what other options we had around the resort, we had to take the room. So we called again in the morning to find a room, and they provided us with a room but we had to check out by 11am and only check back in 3pm the earliest. After spending the day around Waikiki, we finally got our room. However, the next day they shut off the water without warning us. This was an extreme inconvenience as my boyfriend was on the bathroom when we we found this out. I called to find out what happened and the front desk said it was a scheduled shut off until 4pm for our floor. All the guests on the floor were supposed to be notified by a notice under the door, however we never received a notice at all. We once again, had to move out of the room and into another room. After being moved twice in a span of 4 days, I was not satisfied by how the hotel handled this. I had to explain to both the front desk and management my disappointment with the hospitality of the hotel. You do not expect to move twice on a single visit within the same hotel and have water shut off in your room. After voicing my concern and my constant pressure, they offered me an extremely small compensation and told me to deal with it. Please be careful when you stay here. They hotel is under construction.

We arrived around 3:00 in the afternoon, unloaded all of luggage, and waited to check in. The man at the front desk was friendly and after taking our information asked us to wait for the manager. After a few minutes the manager came to inform us that we were being transferred to another hotel. I completely understand mistakes happen, but the situation was handled so poorly by the manager. He started off by telling us “because you are only staying for one night, we are transferring you to another hotel.” Again, I totally understand that issues come up, but blaming the customer for only staying one night doesn’t really make for good customer service. He informed us that we were being transferred to the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani. I was familiar with the hotel because I had looked into when booking weeks earlier because it was considerably cheaper (around $300 a night). When asking the manager if we would receive a refund for the price difference, he told us that he did not know what rates they were charging the public, he only knew what they were charging him, and to not worry we would not be charged more. We reserved two rooms for two people at $630 a night and one room for 4 people at $838 a night (taxes included). After loading all of our luggage back into a cab, and getting to the Sheraton we learned that the Marriott had reserved us 3 rooms, but failed to inform them that one room had 4 people in it, and had reserved us a room with a double bed for four people. The Sheraton then had to contact the Marriott back and forth to figure out the situation, taking much more time, with the Sheraton finally giving us an additional room. 1. After checking in at the Sheraton, I asked her what the room rates were for the night we were there (Keep in mind that this was if I were to book the same day that I was staying there, at the time of booking the Marriott the Sheraton was around $300) and it came out to right around $500 including taxes and the resort fee. It was extremely frustrating to be paying the much higher rate at the Marriott when I could have just booked a room at the Sheraton and saved money and all of the hassle. We never received the difference in the room rates. 2. Paying MUCH more was extremely frustrating, but what was almost worse was the whole afternoon that was lost. After getting to the Marriot and unloading all of our luggage waiting to check in, loading all back up, waiting to check in at the Sheraton, waiting while they went back and forth with the Marriott because they had reserved the wrong type of rooms the entire afternoon was gone. Having only a short stay in Honolulu before continuing the rest of our trip, I surely did not want to spend it doing what I did. I feel like the least they could have done was informed us ahead of time (even an hour would have been great) so we could have gone directly to the Sheraton. Even though the Sheraton had nothing to do with the incident they were actually much more apologetic about the entire situation. The manager also informed us that when booking (and paying full in advanced) with this hotel that their contract states “that we will provide you a place to stay but we don’t have to provide you a place to stay at our hotel.” Keep this in mind when booking here, you might actually end up at a completely different hotel than you booked and will not be refunded the rate difference.",,Phillip Ryan E,1,1.0

Its just across the street from the beach and close to the downtown, malls, restaurants etc.2. Housekeeping staff is very friendly3. Rooms are clean - pretty basic amenities4. Starbucks is inside the hotel5. Rooms have private balconies6. Every tourist activity will most likely have a pick up point at this hotel, because of central location.Cons:1. We are a Marriott Bonvoy member and as we arrived, we were told that we are being upgraded to a better room on higher floor. We got to the room and there were 2 double beds (when we had booked one king). If there were 2 queens, we wouldn't mind because the room had a better view. So we went back to our original booked room.2. Parking here is $45 a day (for self park and $50 for valet), if you rented a car. So we paid $20 per day for rental and $45 for parking. 3. Since the hotel is right on the main street of Waikiki, the road noise is so loud, that you feel like you are sitting on the street. The glass doors and windows are not able to block any noise at all. 4. As if the road noise was not enough, there is so much construction happening at and around the hotel right now that you can hear it from all sides. Again, doors and windows do not block any noise. So if you are trying to take a nap during the day in your room or at the pool, good luck!5. Pool is equally noisy, even late at night, with construction happening. Jacuzzi / hot tub is not functional at this time due to ""rennovation"" 6. Each drink at the pool is at least $13 and I am pretty sure there is negligible alcohol and a lot more cream in pina colada than what $13 is worth. Every food dish at their restaurants is small portions and big price, but oh well, it is a 5 star hotel. 7. We had trouble sleeping because of all the noise around during night time.

This stay was no different. In many ways, this was actually the best stay I've had. The pre-check in e-mail that seems to have been sent to all elite members was such a nice new touch. With such a large hotel, it's often difficult to feel a personalized level of service, but this set the tone for a great stay. I cannot say enough positive things about Sharilyn, the guest services coordinator who helped to coordinate my pre-stay requests. Sharilyn is one of the friendliest and best brand representatives for Marriott that I have come across (and I think that is saying a lot with almost 600 lifetime nights). Not only did she correspond warmly before my stay, I had the opportunity to meet her while at the hotel and she was just as great an ambassador in person. The opportunity to upgrade to an Ocean Front room was much appreciated. The renovations in the Kealohilani tower were so well done. It looks like every aspect of the room was redone. The touches are wonderful and great both for a business or pleasure trip. It is great to see that the owners are putting money back into the property as I cannot wait to see the redone pool area next year. Beyond that, I feel like family whenever I have breakfast at the Kuhio Grill. The staff seem to recognize me from year to year as I am always greeted so warmly. I love that much of that staff has been at Kuhio Grill since I began coming to the property (back in 2006).

I fully expected to have to switch rooms to accommodate my entire stay, but the front desk was able to rearrange so that wouldn't be necessary. While that was definitely appreciated, I'm still skeptical that the room was actually a suite and not just a regular room with 2 queen beds. No sofa or sitting area, no additional amenities than any other Marriott room I'd stayed in (standard mini fridge, coffee, safe). It was on the corner of the hotel so while it did have a lovely ocean view to enjoy for maybe a few minutes in the morning before I would head to the office, that benefit was overshadowed by the nightly music from the neighboring hotel that lasted until 11pm or later. Unfortunately, I heard more of that music while trying to fall asleep before another work day than I saw of the ocean during my entire trip. I know the hotel cannot control entertainment from another hotel, but surely there could have been some forewarning upon check-in. Had I known, I honestly would have passed on the suite and just opted for peace and quiet in the evenings all together. From a confusing arrival with no signage directing us to the hotel entrance from the main street, to late nights of ambient music that didn't help with jet lag or lend itself to a refreshing next day, I found the overall experience to fall short in comparison to my prior Marriott stays.

They have availability of one room further from the ice machine. That's totally not worth the swap. Then we told her that we don't mind waiting another day of that will be better, so they can take their time to accommodate us to a better room.It was well worth the wait, Kalae (apologies if the name is incorrect), the same reception staff from the day before, had us check in our bags, and gave us our new rooms at 1500 the next day. We got in the room, opened the balcony and just sigh. Beautiful. Not only we were further away from the ice machine, we were further up. Fantastic views. I could swear the room seems bigger, but maybe because it's beautiful it just seems better. We met her again close to the end of our visit. We stopped by reception just to thank her, she was just wonderful. We were truly grateful, she made all the difference to our stay.We spent a good few times at the pool at days when we were too tired to go to the beach.

On the day we were leaving hotel was when the travel agency notified us of the construction.Our room was directly above the construction site. On the day we checked-in the guest relations agent had to stop the check-in process because the jackhammer noise was so loud she could not communicate to us. Every morning of our stay, the jackhammers begin around 8 AM and went on for hours. On one day our water was shut off due to construction.One of the managers from the Marriott property contacted me on Friday (Oct 18th) morning. He called around 9:00am MST and I made a comment to him that it was 5:00 am in Hawaii. He stated that he was the late night manager and following up on my comments. He said that there was a manager on duty 24 hours a day at the resort.I told him that on the day we checked in that the clerk had to stop the check in process because the jackhammers were so loud you couldn’t hear her. I also told him that the jackhammers were going off every morning and there were front end loader’s hauling off concrete outside our window. I also told him about the water being shut off on the one afternoon. I also explained to him that we had stayed at the Marriott resort hotels and this was not consistent with our resort experiences with Marroitt. The manager stated that the hotel was under reconstruction and the area that we were staying was part of the tower that were being renovated. The manager said that we “should have expected some issues or inconveniences as a result of the renovation”. REALLY!!!The manager offered to give us future free nights at the resort or add Marriott points to my account. I told him that I would like to talk to my wife about his offer and ask if he could call me back Saturday morning at around the same time. He said he would call me back Saturday and we have not heard from them.I am very disappointed with Marriott headquarters as well as this hotel as no one could ever call our experience as a resort destination.

I was originally in a smaller room with two double beds which I found to be ok, but a bit too small for me. I had a leaking toilet so after the first night the manager offered to put me in another room, so I took the offer. The second room was much bigger with bigger beds but was lacking any kind of view. Regardless I was still happy and am thankful for the bigger bed. BE AWARE that there is a lot of construction/renovations going on for the next few months at this property so if you are a late sleeper or want to have access to a big swimming pool this might not be the place for you. This is from my April 2019 stay:The rooms are nice and the staff is friendly and helpful. My only negative is that the bed was too hard for my liking. Other than that in enjoyed staying here very much. It’s close to everything in Waikiki and if you don’t like to walk, grab an Uber or Lyft.

I asked the check-in agent what we get for the fees and he basically could not answer the question. There are reviews on here about great staff, however they must have been on holiday the week I was there, with the exception of the staff in the restaurant at breakfast whom was very friendly and efficient. We were not given a room upgrade although I have elite status with Marriott, the check-in agent seemed very disinterested. He did offer us complimentary breakfast because there is no Concierge lounge at the hotel. Breakfast buffet was adequate however it was basically the same thing every day. Some variety would have been nice. As noted on here the parking is very expensive - $50/day for valet plus tax. I'm told it is some of the most expensive in Waikiki. More disappointing was that I had contacted the hotel prior to arrival to ask if they could do something for us the day we were getting married. Supposedly they took note of this, however they did nothing, epic fail on the part of the hotel. Too bad, because these are the small things that make a ""great stay"" an ""outstanding stay."" Room was adequate, it had been renovated which was nice but nothing special. As noted in other reviews on this site, the pool area is very crowded and chairs can be hard to come by.

In reality, within two blocks of the place there are less expensive places to stay, because all of you end up using a crosswalk to hunt for a spot on public beach. The a Marriott justifies that $37 “resort” fee by offering things like ukulele lessons, but it’s a hotel (not a resort).Room: Just fine, remodeled, clean carpet, decent furniture, decent bathroom fixtures, good working Air Conditioner, clean smelling room, great maid service!Staff: Didn’t need them much but everyone, and I mean everyone was fantastic and hospitable!Pool: For a two tower hotel WAY TOO SMALL, and too few beach chairs. You would have to get there earlier to reserve a spot and who wants to do that on vacation. Sure, just cross the street and hunt for a spot on the public beach, but if you want to spend any time there you might want to stop by a store a buy a beach umbrella.Food: We passed on the $45 dollar breakfast buffet and the $20 Hamburgers at the pool bar. There are a ton of nice restaurants in walking distance.Parking: $45 a day self park or $50 valet.

When we asked the hotel, we were informed that half of the hotel is renovated and half is not. We were in the un-renovated tower and it was an additional $175/night to get the room we thought we had booked in the beginning. We honestly debated cancelling our reservation and finding a new hotel, but we were there during a peak time, and there was nothing else available. We paid for the upgrade, because we refused to stay in the old room.

Overall, the experience was terrific. They are under construction, but we did not hear any of the construction noise as it is happening mostly on the lower floors of the hotel. Note that the entrance to this Marriott is on ‘Ohua Ave. and not Paoakalani Ave. as Google map states.Typical of parking anywhere in Waikiki, it is expensive: $50 for valet and $45 for garage. The porters are friendly and work well together. The parking garage entrance is half-way down the block from the valet entrance. It is a tight garage and some people drive very aggressively so watch yourself before getting to each corner. The main hotel entrance is on the first floor but access to one of the towers/shops from the second and third levels. They also have a dedicated tour group part of the hotel where tour buses can pick you up away from the main entrance of the resort.Check-in is nice and simple with a wonderful staff behind the desk. They genuinely seem happy to see the guest and treat them with respect.Our room was nice and updated; a cozy place and well thought out. There is a small closet with a safe, ironing board, iron. A single cup coffee maker with some coffee and a mini-fridge. I have begun to understand and appreciate the sliding door to the bathroom so the door is not in the way when open, same for the shower. The rooms are not so isolated though as there was a larger than average (to me) gap at the bottom of our front door, roughly an eighth of an inch, 4 mm. It was convenient for the staff to slide papers under the door, but I thought it would be easy enough for insects to enter as well. Noise in the hallway can easily be heard in the room. The lanai had two chairs and a cot.The staff was excellent and polite. Our room keeper did not seem to take our “tip” we left, so we left a larger one upon our departure.This resort is on the east end of Waikiki but an easy walk to anywhere on the main street. Across the street, the beach has a rock wall so it is suitable for children to get into the ocean water although it can get a bit dirty.There are plenty of shops and restaurants on-site and more just block away. They have a saline swimming pool on the third floor. Grab some towels by the pool to lay out to get some sun or if you want to go out and explore other beaches. Good place to stay if you want a slightly (and honestly I mean “slightly”) calmer Waikiki experience but can get into the experience very easily by walking a few blocks to the west.Overall, a wonderful stay with pleasant and helpful staff and will definitely consider staying again the next time we visit in Waikiki.","Los Angeles, California","Gr8NoCall</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",29,5.0

We were in Maui for about a week and decided to hop over to Oahu to see some family and friends. In Maui, we decided to stay in a Time Share from a rental company and our services there were subpar, so it was so nice to come to this resort and find the opposite.The main reason for my review is to tell you about how much we enjoyed, Buster. He took our bags to our room and told us about all the great things your resort had to offer, including the fact that we could see an amazing sunset and the Friday night fireworks from our room. We were just about to head to that area, so he saved us a trip. We would of missed out on a spectualar view had he not mentioned it. (Note: my understainding is this is only the rooms facing west in the K Tower).In addition, I found myself a bit lost at one point trying to find the pool towels later in the evening. I ended up in the Lobby and Buster asked me, if I needed some help. I was a bit embarrassed since he just told us earlier that day, but he took the time escort me, so I wouldn't be confused from his directions, again.All in all, we had a spectacular time. The entire staff was amazing, especially everyone at Valet, the Bell Man, and Buster. We think we left a couple of ours son's toys and books in the room - we think he threw it behind the couch or bed. I called and everyone there was very helpful and they said it may take a couple of days for someone to call me back, since the room is occupied. I have little hope that they would find it, but appreciated them taking the time to talk to me and I hope to hear from someone soon.I will definately be recommending this place to all of my friends and family and plan on staying there again, next time we are in Oahu.I forgot to mention that this place has DC Steakhouse and Sensai Sushi. Both are the same owner and share the bar. They have Happy Hour including a late night Happy Hour with Karaoke. Note: Their maybe a wait, so get there early. Also, if you don't want to wait.

It has a few shops on the ground floor and some restaurants over 2 floors that the rest of the general public can access. Are resort fees a strange American custom - never heard of these before this trip. We really begrudge paying an extra $200 dollars when we paid silly money to come To Hawai’i from Scotland to begin with. What did my fees pay for? WiFi (free to access. Some discounts? (didn’t use them). Parking (nope, had to pay for that too). The Pool? ( you can wander in off the street and use it). The resort fees should really be rolled up in the price. They offer nothing extra and really tarnish what would have otherwise been an excellent stay. Absolute scam by hotels in the USA and something to question with your holiday booker/travel company. Location is however, excellent. 2- minute walk across the Main Street from the hotel to Waikiki beach. 32nd floor view from the rear tower was awesome from our balcony. Sansei restaurant was a great tip and though maybe a little pricey, a great honeymoon meal.

The room upgrade isn’t really worth it. There are a few things they need to work out in their renovations. The bathroom faucet is too far from the edge of the sink so it sprays all over the edge of the counter. The bathroom shower didn’t seal well so there is always water leaked onto the floor.

We have been loyal Marriott customers for thirty years. Due to this, and our 'status' we were given 'free' breakfast vouchers for three people (my husband, myself and our five-year old). We had enough for our fifteen day stay. My husband was serving his annual duty on Pearl Harbor. Due to his officer schedule, he had to be at the base at 6:00 am. That meant he needed his car from valet at 5:00 am. They never got it to him in time during the entire stay. It also meant he didn't get the free breakfast buffet, because they don't open until 6. So I used vouchers and took him fruit for when he returned home. On the second day I tipped our server $15 for nothing (as it was buffet and we didn't order coffee or tea) but she was kind and we tipped her and left. As we left the restaurant, two men approached me and stood on each side of me. My daughter was behind me. Neither men introduced themselves or acknowledged who they were. I said this better not be about the fruit because I just gave the server $15 and two breakfast vouchers, my five year-old didn't need one. They asked me to go into an office with them. I asked them to identify themselves and what this was about. They told me I was seen stealing silverware from the restaurant..... I was blown away. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. First of all, my silverware is the Arctic pattern from Pottery Barn, not their cheap silverware, and we had yet to even leave the complex, making it a legal impossibility. Theft is taking something and converting it to your sole use. We had not even left the hotel, dealing with jet lag from the day before. I was outraged. My daughter was confused and crying. I told them I would not go into any office, if they were going to accuse me of something if public I would be vindicated in public. I gave them my name and told them I was through and to leave me alone.I took my daughter and tried to comfort her, but she went into hysterics saying they were going to arrest us. I said no, they were leaving us alone. I was wrong. I turned around, and sure enough, they were following us. I went to the front desk extremely upset and dealt with the front desk manager. There were several women standing there and they asked why the men kept coming over to me when I had made it clear to leave me alone. After thirty years, this is how we were treated. When I did Pro Bowl events, they treated me like I was special, but when travelling for military duty for our country we were treated like scum. The general manager knew of this situation and did NOTHING to make it right. He did not even reach out to me. We still had 12 days to deal with that place, and unfortuneately couldn't make a different reservation elsewhere. Not only did they assault my daughter and I, they thought that moving us into a king suite from a queen would somehow make things better -- with two days remaining. The general manager was condescending and arrogant, and has zero respect for women. I will never, ever stay at another Marriott again, and am disgusted that they think that less than a year later I would be interested in their repeated attempts to get me to join their new bon voyage or something program that I now receive endless emails about. Now what to do with all these books of mormon. Shame on you Marriott for believing traumatising your guests isn't 'damage'.",,Ziggy T,28,1.0

The bathroom was quite small in comparison but that's a first world problem. Towels are really thick, good quality - always a sign that your hotel takes itself seriously. Housekeeping was great, all staff friendly and polite. Everywhere is clean, dusted. Lots of amenities at the hotel to cover all ages and groups. One of the bonuses of the hotel was its proximity to the beach, and that the trolley bus (Hawaiian institution) stop was at the back of the hotel. One thing, if you are being picked up for any activities from the Waikiki Beach Marriott, ensure you ask EXACTLY which lobby you will be collected from - there are 3 entrances. There's the front, main lobby; there's a Tour Lobby (used a lot) and a smaller half hidden 'lobby' on the south, beach side. I couldn't fault the standard of service from hotel staff or staff in shops within the hotel. Make use of the friendly and efficient concierges who will arrange or advise on anything you'd like to do.

ABC stores are in hotel as well as cute shops, ukulele store, Starbucks and more. Enterprise was right in hotel and we reserved cars 3 separate days. Convenient for sure. Water stations to refill bottles were great. I took advantage of two complementary yoga classes in the hotel which were amazing and my husband enjoyed the fitness center. Also did free lei making classes with kids and ukulele lesson. Concierges were very helpful. We did chiefs luau and entire family enjoyed that. Housekeeping was great. TVs had Netflix etc. rooms were clean. Balconies were lovely. We had ocean front which we enjoyed. PF Chang’s and Cheesecake Factory 15 min walk approximately. Tons of shopping and malls nearby. Beach in front of hotel had wall to protect from crashing waves. Great for younger children. Very near that were beaches w larger waves. It seemed that beaches near Marriott were far less crowded than ones up towards Westin and the more central part. People were really crammed together there.The only inconvenience we had with the construction was the first full day we were there we did not have water in our room from 10 to 3 but other rooms were available for this. They gave us notice for this and even upon check in asked if we wanted to switch rooms. We just headed to beach and pool that day and it was not an issue. Other than that you heard an occasional drill or noise but frankly the sound of police cars and ambulances going by was way more loud than this! I would not hesitate staying in this hotel again.

I am Titanium Elite and was hoping for all the normal amenities. Not so. We did get free breakfast, but there is no lounge access where in the evening you get some free food and free drinks. The breakfast is not bad, but a far cry from the quality I am used to in the European Marriotts. For the 10 days it costs me 490,000 points for an ocean view room! In addition they charge you $35 per day as a ""resort fee."" Just another way to get more money out of you. I did have suite night upgrades for the 10 days: however, the suite they offered us was not much more than a big normal room with a two sink bathroom. Also, you could not see the ocean from the suite (city view). The other thing, which eventually made me refuse the suite is the noise that came from the outside. Directly underneath there were these large AC heat exchangers that rattled quite loud. Then they found us a room on the 32nd floor in the Paoakalani Tower. However, that room was close to the 5 elevator shafts. These elevators are very loud and they sound like a wooden roller-coaster when they rush up. Also, if you wanted to get a glimpse of the ocean, you had to look sideways from the balcony. The next day we changed rooms again. We got a room furthest away from the elevators. There we could not hear the elevators but now we could hear every bus that passed by the hotel, even though we were on the 29st floor. Just be aware, if you book this hotel, the windows are not soundproof at all. They not even dual pane windows.The decor in the rooms is dated and quite rough in some spots.To make a long story short, I do not feel this hotel is worth the almost a half million points it costs me to stay there.

My other issue is that the noise from the construction was so loud. I came back from work at 3 pm and wanted to rest since I am coming from DC.

It will call a room ""ocean front"" even when it actually fronts on a side street (Ohua Ave) and has no ""ocean"" frontage at all. So whatever you do, DO NOT pay extra for an ""ocean view"" or ""ocean front"" room. It is a total waste of money.Beyond the views issue, the carpets and furnishings in the rooms are extremely tired.

They were both very engaging, pleasant, and accommodating. This team did a superb job ensuring this traveler was taken care of. Thank you. You both should receive awards for your work.Second, the Kealohilani Tower restaurants were awesome. The Kuhio Beach Grill hosted a superb dinner and morning breakfast area. The prepared food was fresh with pleasant distinct flavors and well presented. Nicely done. Note: for this hotel the breakfast area open at 5:00 a.m.; which made it more convenient to start the exploration day. Also, the Starbucks opened at 4:30 a.m. to help raise the eyelids. Wonderful, wonderful!Third, the room accommodations were very comfortable. The complimentary toiletries were high-end brands. My room was in the Paoakalani Tower which provide a nice view of Waikiki beach and Diamond Head. Room 3068.The walkout balcony provided to chairs and table to relax and enjoy the view. I could see the surfers catching rides. The room had a mini-fridge but no microwave.Fourth, this hotel provided hydration stations located throughout the hotel. The system was easy to use for refilling water bottles with filter water. Good way to cut down on water purchases. The elevators provided a secure access system. Room key needed to scan and get to your own room. :)Fifth, the hotels location is perfect. Fifteen minutes from the main airport. Easy 28$-40$ Uber ride. The hotel is surrounded by several quaint shopping areas and parks.

Convenience is its selling feature: adjacent to Waikiki Beach, it is very convenient to the ocean, and there are several convenience chains and multiple Starbucks on its ground floors. The two pools are nice (if small).: my kids didn't mind the size, and like their 6 and 8 foot depths. If you're looking to just sleep in the rooms, this hotel is a good option: clean in the rooms and common areas and courteous staff.A COUPLE OF WATCH-OUTS:Hold on to your wallet, as this property charges a lot of extras. Parking is $50/day valet, there is a $40ish ""resort fee"" every day in addition to your room that gives you access to, essentially, a Redbox of quasi-current DVDs and a couple of arts and crafts offerings. It would be way less infuriating if they just raised the room rates, as there is nothing resortish about this property.As of April 2019, the hotel is undergoing significant (and badly needed) renovation of the guest rooms, so brace for noise and inconvenience. Finally-- this is a tired property. The rooms are badly dated; the bathrooms especially are not up to modern hotel standards (iron tub/shower combo with grip tape at the bottom, single vanity counters, no locking doors on the bathroom. The beds are tired and not comparable with more modern Marriotts, and the furniture bares at least a decade's worth of wear and tear. BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a basecamp to explore Oahu, this hotel is a serviceable option. If you're a Marriott loyalist (like I am), you WILL be disappointed in the comfort and design of the rooms.

And if you have allergies like me, be prepared to have a miserable time. My daughter developed a rash that I attribute to room’s level of cleanliness. The word the staff kept using was “dated”, but you won’t find that anywhere on the room descriptions before booking. At $209(plus resort fee), I should have known better. The service at the front desk was average and they did accommodate a room change which took two attempts. Other hotels have done more with less harm.

Perhaps what is most disappointing is that this discovery occurred on our honeymoon. We had never visited Waikiki before and we’re relying heavily on reviews. We picked this hotel because of location and based on other feedback online. When we arrived we were informed that, although we’d requested a king bed, there were none available, so instead were we okay with two doubles. We said we were celebrating and would prefer a king, and they were able to compromise and find is a room with a queen bed. They then explained that there was construction happening in our tower and we should expect noise from 9-5 on the days that we would stay, until this point there had been no communication about construction and the rates had not been reduced. Again we were disappointed, but we wanted to stay positive, I explained that it was our honeymoon and asked whether there was any chance that they could find us another room, they said they were fully booked. They then explained the $35 per person mandatory ‘resort fee’ we needed to pay in addition to what was already paid for. When we asked what this was for they explained the wide range of exercise classes available (including yoga with lululemon, which is complementary wherever you are in the world...) and a few other scheduled events hosted at the hotel we were not interested in attending. We arrived at our “city view room” and were not so pleasantly surprised when we opened the curtains that overlooked a massive concrete parking lot with a offensive 7 metre concrete cylindrical vent/structure outside our window as our ‘view’. The room was tiny and extremely outdated. I called the front desk to see whether there was indeed another room we could move to and they said that we could consider an ocean view room but this would be an additional $45 a night and was potentially in the other tower. By this stage I was extremely frustrated and not interested in spending more time or money so we agreed to stick it out where we were rather than drag the escapade out longer! When we booked at the Marriott we had expected a certain level of professionalism, customer service and room standard-none of which were met. Having now explored Waikiki and having strolled through other hotels on the strip that are priced comparably and FAR more luxurious I wish I had this information beforehand!

Overall the hotel was perfect for what we needed. It is across the street from the beach, which was great, it has a ton of shopping and restaurants within walking distance, and everyone at the hotel was BEYOND kind and accommodating. We were in an older room - I know they are remodeling them now - but the room was fine, no complaints at all. We didn't use much of the amenities on property but the pool looked nice and there are several shops and stuff downstairs. The only reason this is a 4 star review instead of 5 star is that you are automatically charged for parking ($50 a day) and there is a resort fee which was in the $30 per day range. I booked this through Marriott and was not told about these fees upfront. Other than that we did have a great stay and I can't stress enough how genuine and kind every single person who works here was.","Lake Mary, Florida","Heather O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake Mary, Florida</strong>",7,4.0

I’m a devout SPG/Marriott platinum member and try to not go off brand. Typically you know what you’re getting and the hotels have consistency that’s dependable. I feel this property misses the mark with the Marriott brand. There are multiple towers so potentially I was placed in one that is being updated soon. My room was very dated, very tired, musty smell, old dingy carpets. On the plus side, the view is fantastic out to Diamondhead. And the locations is stellar as well. Confusing to me is the $37 daily resort fee. This nets you two disposable water containers, access to the practically non functional WiFi, some fitness classes I won’t be taking, DVD rental (why on earth would I rent a DVD here), and a few other items that will not be used. This is a hotel not a resort. If Marriott needs to increase rates to stay profitable for this property, just add $37 to the already overpriced room rate. I’d feel less ripped off, just call it what it is. So my point here being, the value for the price is way below my expectations as a platinum Bonvoy member due to the quality of the accommodation (dated room, musty smell, old feel). There are other properties in Waikiki in this same price range that would delivery on those features.

I'm Platinum Elite with Marriott so I tend to stick with Marriott properties whenever possible. I looked at several options in the Waikiki area -- mostly due to proximity to the U Hawaii Manoa campus - where my meetings would be. I looked at all of the Marriott/SPG properties in the area and almost selected the Laylow or Sheraton, but the Sheraton reviews here made me change my mind. I opted for the Marriott for the ocean views, ultimately, I suppose. In retrospect, I wish I'd chosen the Laylow. So, the good -- the view is decent, though for a premium room I would have expected a little better. The staff at the hotel was great. That's actually one of the biggest pluses I found to this location. They were all very friendly and helpful and welcoming. The on-property restaurants were top notch. In fact, I very much enjoyed the steakhouse and sushi restaurant. The Italian restaurant on property was primarily outside seating and it would have been better if the evening hadn't been a little chilly -- not their fault -- I wasn't expecting to sit outside.The not-so-good -- they were actively doing room renovations in the hotel. They had limited hours to 10am to 4pm for the work, though on at least three of the days, I heard them start between 8:30 and 9am. If I hadn't already been awake, I probably would have been more than a little irritated. The rooms are definitely in need of updating, though. Mine was not in great repair and it wasn't terribly clean, especially the bathroom. The walls and door were incredibly thin. I could hear neighbors on both sides having conversations (and not really loud ones) and when people were talking in the hall, they may as well have been standing in the entryway of the room. The ugly - the resort fee. I'm not sure I noticed that on the Marriott site when I was booking, but it's pretty much gouging. There's really no service that was provided worth the fee. I think this is the first Marriott I've ever stayed in that had a resort fee. I'll pay more attention next time...but Marriott might consider revising the services one would get for that fee if they're going to have it. All in all, it wasn't a bad property or a terrible experience and I don't want to paint it as such. I just feel it's a bit overpriced for what you get...and I'm not one to skimp on price to get what I want. I will seek other options on my next trip to the Waikiki area, though.","Bloomington, Indiana","jeremyf894</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bloomington, Indiana</strong>",5,3.0

You can also walk across the street to the beach (it’s essentially beach front) and there are plenty of shops and restaurants nearby.Parking was a little tight. It filled up a couple of times, but if that happened, the valet guys would park it for you for the same price as self-park.Overall this is a solid bet in downtown Honolulu. Even better if you have status with Marriot.","Boise, Idaho","DCTraveler187</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boise, Idaho</strong>",51,5.0

The room was huge and had a great view of Waikiki Beach. I loved the balcony and spent time out there every morning and evening enjoying the waves, watching surfers and the beautiful sunrises/sunsets. The chaise lounge chair was my favorite spot. This part of Waikiki is a little quieter, but it's still a busy area. Wonderful for walking and exploring, though.The room itself was quite comfortable, I had a king bed and plenty of room in the room itself. The bathroom as others have noted is small, but they are planning a renovation soon I believe. It wasn't so small that I would avoid staying there again, but I was traveling alone. It could be an issue for couples or families to share that space.Service was terrific! When I arrived around 6pm on a Saturday, exhausted from 12+ hours of travel and a long drive from the airport (Waikiki Santa Festival closed roads combined with getting lost :)), I was fried. Everyone I encountered upon checkin was so kind and thoughtful from the valet who took my car and unloaded my bags to the young man who checked me in at the front desk who saw how exhausted I was and said 'I'm going to get you to your room quickly, so just call down tomorrow if you have any questions'. Appreciated him skipping the overview :) I ordered room service a few times and ate at the poolside restaurant. Great food, great service and a lovely view of the ocean.The facilities here are well maintained and very convenient. I enjoyed having the ABC Store and Starbucks downstairs. I picked up breakfast there most mornings and went for a walk on the beach to enjoy the sunrise. Once the work part of my trip was over, I spend a lovely afternoon by their pool.At the end of my trip, I changed hotels to the Kahala Resort (which was great) for my last 2 nights in Hawaii. I thought I'd treat myself to a more resort style experience. In hindsight, although the Kahala was lovely I'm not sure I'd have changed hotels. Something about the Waikiki Marriott was just so comfortable.","New Berlin, Wisconsin","myllek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Berlin, Wisconsin</strong>",41,4.0

The staff is very friendly and helpful, and is probably the strongest point to the hotel. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. We were in the non-renovated tower, but quite frankly we did not feel the difference. There are two issues that prevent us from giving this a five star review. Firstly the parking lot is an absolute nightmare. The spaces are small, and it is very difficult to negotiate the corners if someone else is coming in the other direction. Secondly, and perhaps even more annoying, is the fact that two weeks before our reservation we received an email from Marriott telling us there would be a $37 resort charge per day per room. Essentially this is a bait and switch regarding pricing as we had no opportunity to decline the resort charge without canceling the reservation, and we did not use the pool or the gym.

We enjoyed our stay, but we were there mainly to see family so we didn't spend a ton of time at the hotel. The location is nice as it is on the edge of Waikiki so the congestion is not quite as bad as being in the heart of Waikiki. The Pros: -Our room faced Diamond Head and it was lovely to see it and the ocean from our balcony.-The gym was spacious, nice new equipment, and the morning Yoga classes were great. -Pool wasn't very crowded (but we weren't really in there during peak times)-Pool bar has a nice view of the Waikiki SunsetThe Cons: -hotel lobby and surrounding areas have a big of a shopping center feel. There is no place to just chill out on a hammock or similar. -Swimming pools are pretty standard rectangular pools (probably built many years ago). There are 2 pools, with a strange vast concrete area between them. -The buffet restaurant was terrible. A meager offering of choices and a very sterile cafeteria feel.

Some are great like returning to your favorite aunt or uncle and love to chat then some appear jaded and bitter toward the customer (or maybe their job). Some wore large union pins saying “workers should only need one job.” Everyone dislikes the resort fees but the resort fees here for $37 per day are truly worthless. Marriott should be honest and transparent and include the cost in the base rate rather than generating unnecessary ill will. The rooms are very clean and they do a good job maintaining the property.

There are shops and a starbucks in the lobby area. The ""Hydration Station"" in the lobby is very awkward to use because of the height and a wide counter in front of it - I would say Not ADA Compliant - they should address this issue - the counter in front could be made narrower - it is about 30"" deep and only needs to be about 12"" deep. The RoomNothing spectacular - standard Marriott room - consistent The BreakfastIncluded as a platinum member - very nice breakfast buffet - Shout Out to Chuck Schumacher, he makes a great omelette and is entertaining, Pro Tip: ask for a cracked egg omelette - the pineapple and papaya are wonderful - the sticky buns are very good - recommend the bread pudding with vanilla sauce, add a sprinkle of cinnamon from the oatmeal stationThe Prime Rib BuffetThe Prime Rib was excellent - delicious, tender, and juicy. The rest of the buffet wasn't very good. We went on Thursday which is Asian fare. We took advantage of the 50% off deal available Monday through Thursday during limited hours (I think it was 4-6 PM and 8-10 PM). Considering the cost of everything in HI being pricy the buffet was a very good option all things considered.ParkingThe parking garage is very tight. we didn't experience any issues with our vehicle. I did hear on pickup truck crunch on one of the columns as the driver cut a corner too tight. I saw another vehicle during my stay that appeared to have scrape on the passenger side consistent with an encounter with a concrete column. Resort FeeThis property charges a $37 per day resort amenity fee. There is a daily activity in the lobby which my wife participated in several times. She made some beautiful Leis out of Orchids on two days and Ribbon on another day. Other activities include Yoga classes and scuba diving training.LocationThis property is nicely located just across the street from a very nice beach with barriers that make for minimal wave action. Many people go beyond the barriers for surfing. The beach is beautiful with numerous palm trees. There are areas where you can sit in the shade and outdoor open air showers to rinse off before/after going into the ocean. There is a plethora of dining and shopping within a 5 to 10 minute walk. The property is large with two towers with hotel rooms and many shopping outlets and rental car desks included. There is an open air area with shops and seats closer to the beach too. There are two pools and a hot tub and plenty of areas to sit in the sun or shade if you prefer. It takes about 5 minutes to drive to the H1 - you can pretty much be anywhere on the island in less than an hour. There were a number of homeless people in the area along the beach witnessed during our stay. Sad to see but we didn't experience any issues with them. There was periodic Police presence - we saw one person get jacked up for jaywalking so watch those traffic signals.Fitness CenterExtensive fitness center with plenty of high end cardio equipment and machines.Hydration StationsThe hotel has several areas to refill water bottles.

Make sure to bring your own water bottles to refill as there are free water stations located throughout the hotel. They do give u a small water refillable pouch but we drink a lot of water so it was handy we brought our own refillable bottles. Big enough to put ice on ready for hikes and walks etc. The ice machine on our floor we used quite a bit. The ocean facing room itself we had was amazing very roomy, Great view for sunset pictures and watching the waves. The pool was small yet sufficient and you were able to bring their beach towels to the beach and return for fresh towels daily. Our room attendants were amazing our room was cleaned impeccably each day. It was so handy facing Starbucks downstairs for my daily coffee fix. Cold foam brew & cacao protein shake were the best. The hotel was close to other hotels that had great restaurants within walking distance for snacks and açai bowls. Very safe, secure hotel in the quieter end of Waikiki and a great walk to/from diamond head hike and easy to bike ride around. When staying here you get a Marriott card that entitles you to free Honolulu cookies daily 1 per person. That was a great perk. The room also had the biggest safe I have ever seen fitted laptop, camera gear and a backpack which came in handy.

The pools are just ok there isn’t one that is great for kids that you would expect at a resort. The rooms as small but that’s ok as you shouldn’t spend much time in them with so much great things to do close by. The gym is outstanding lots of space and equipment. Now the really disappointingly part, the staff are just not up to the standards of what I have come to expect from SPG/Marriott hotels. As a Platinum Elite with Ambassador member I spend both a lot of time and money at hotels each year and my check in experience was the worst ever at a SPG/Marriott hotel. I was told we would have our room in 60 minutes so we went for lunch when we came back to see if the room was ready 90 minutes later it was not. I didn’t know it at the time but the person that was at the desk was the manager Carina. She is the WORST person I have ever spoke with at a hotel ever. Based on her I would not stay here again choosing the Westin down the street instead if you are looking for a hotel in the SPG world.

Even though didn't have the CEO of Marriott bump us to penthouse this trip still an awesome stay! My husband generally doesn't like to stay in same place twice and I research things to the extreme. Our plans changed and we decided to do the NCL cruise again after Pearl Harbor ceremony on the 7th. Originally booked it through NCL until they wouldn't add the extra days. So just did it on our own. I research other places for about 2 years truly glad we went with the tried and true. Our room had fabulous views and was quite roomy. Beach access was Awesome right across the street, not to crowded and there was a wall to keep the water calm. The cafe by the pool was really great as was our server Cheryl she was Top Shelf. It's kind of cool I used to think of Marriott as out of our league cost wise, but have stayed at a Marriott 3-4 in the last 9 years and has been affordable.

Mostly because of the good service, reasonable rates (outside of Xmas of course) and great location. The main beach at Waikiki is a 5-minute walk, so you don't have to be stuck in the congestion that crushes you in the central and north ends of the beach. There are two Starbucks in the building, their house restaurant (Kuhio Beach) a decent steak place (d.k), a good sushi place (Sansei), and a crowded Italian place (Arancino). While there is some fast food nearby, you also have the new opened Morimoto Asia and its more casual sister, Momosan nearby (both highly recommended!). There are a few downsides, but they're not dealbreakers: They redesigned the lobby a few years ago, so while more contemporary, it was done on the cheap. Feels more like an ugly furniture showroom than a grand lobby (granted, it is open air). While the views can be wonderful, the rooms often feel dated, and we've noticed worn furniture and carpet here and there. The pool feels small and uninviting, but the gym on the same level is pretty good. Still, the location means we can walk to central Waikiki in a few minutes, or quickly escape for a hike at Diamondhead and the east side of the island. Overall, the place could be better, but we still like the staff and its conveniences.","Redondo Beach, California","Tom M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redondo Beach, California</strong>",3,4.0

Jordan at check in (who remembered exactly who we were three days later) handled our situation with aplomb, making sure we received Elite status all the way through to our departure, with an upper floor room near elevators as requested. The buffet breakfast was plentiful with great service by Laini, a real pro of a waitress. The nightly entertainment at the Moana Terrace was great with the guys encouraging requests and dancing which we did with a great connection to the fun crowd there with us. The only downside was the very expensive and average dinner we had on the Terrace. (An average salad with a small piece of fish on it for 25 bucks). The tour lobby is very helpful and convenient for all pickups and dropoffs. Definitely liked that. Right across from the beach. Loved the open air areas all around. Only a block from the zoo and aquarium which was nothing super special but nice to support their education and ecological programs.

It’s right across from the beach with views of Diamond Head and walking distance to a lot of restaurants, shops, and attractions. We cannot say enough about the hotel staff – they were top notch and only added to our experience! Everyone we encountered was warm, welcoming and eager to ensure we had a pleasurable stay. We stayed in the Keohilani tower and our room had beautiful views of the beach with its many surfers, boats, and sunsets. Our room was very clean and comfortable and more than met all our needs. The breakfast buffet at Kuhio Beach Grill was very good, fresh omelets, fruit, pastries, BACON, and much much more. The wait staff hustle and even offer “to-go” cups for coffee and waters. However, dinner there is more cafeteria style with bright lighting and no atmosphere. Moana Terrace, the pool bar, is fun with happy hour specials and live entertainment every night. During our stay there was plenty space at the pool, so no need to get up at the crack of dawn to grab a chair. The beach is across the street, so there are no chairs or service on the beach. However, there are plenty of places in or near the hotel to rent chairs and umbrellas.I like that we received refillable water bottles when we arrived and there are several filling stations located throughout the property that came in very handy and is very green! It was also convenient that they had an ABC store on the main level, where you can get just about anything you need from liquor/snacks to souvenirs for reasonable prices.We would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others.",Massachusetts,"DodgerMom668</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Massachusetts</strong>",77,5.0

First off, we are both Marriott loyalists - and will be in the future. We used points for the stay and were even 'upgraded' to a larger room on the corner right next to the ocean with a great view of the sunset at night. A couple of key things stick out about this Marriott - First, there is no lounge for Marriott Rewards members. Platinum and Platinum Elite members have the option to choose points or breakfast for 2 each day/night of the stay. The breakfast is amazing and has a wide variety of options to fit the appetite of anyone from various cultures who stay at the resort. Second, the service you receive from the team at the hotel is second to none. Every one you pass says hello and tries to help (if needed). Finally, as nice as everything is the building and facilities are in desperate need of upgrades. It was infuriating during our stay to have constant issues with our shower - it would not drain and made the 'upgraded' room a laugh every time we walked in. Taking into consideration there were protests by the housekeeping staff at multiple hotels near the Marriott we won't complain but can't say we'd rush back here. This is a good property but for the steep price tag (or points per night) I have to believe there is a better option nearby.","Kansas City, Missouri","andrewandcaitd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kansas City, Missouri</strong>",22,4.0

On arrival I went to the desk and said ""Hey I've been emailing back and forth..."" front desk weren't interested in what I was trying to achieve and basically left me high and dry trying to improvise a proposal which I manage to pull a rabbit out a hat on the beach with a basic picnic no thanks to the Marriott staff...Previously when I stayed here guest where given to free cocktails during happy hour via little coupons... that never happened and the bar is grossly over priced compared to the last time I was here. I found blood stains in the bed sheets and requested someone come change the sheets...that never happened...I tried to organise a pearl harbour tour the concierge, and when I decided not to do the tour due to the price, every time I walked past I would get a dagger stare from the staff...Oh and there is some ridiculous resort fee which I have no idea why I paid this every day or what exactly it entitles me too...Absolutely terrible service from the staff and I will NEVER! stay here again... and to add insult to every terrible review you get some canned response from management saying ""they will look into the issues"" Yeah that is total BS...For what you pay, this hotel has become grossly overrated, I have no interest in ever coming back here again and will make it my goal to ensure I let everyone who comes to Waikiki where not to stay.","Gold Coast, Australia","Red_October_88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast, Australia</strong>",204,1.0

First of all, the location is superb! Beach front and right on the middle of everything. From check in to check out everything was very pleasant and we didn’t have any issues. Got a great big room with a very comfy king bed! Bathroom (shower/tub) is on a small size but the sink is outside, which is a great feature. Air conditioner worked great! No issues with the TV, refrigerator or anything else. The view was PRICELESS! We stayed in the 31st floor with a full view of the ocean and Diamond Head. So basically when we were in the room, we were in the balcony just enjoying the gorgeous Waikiki scenario. 2 great pools in the property. Wish they had a bigger jacuzzi or more than one. We did tried to use for 3 days in a row and it was very crowded. Nice gym! Small garage.The pool bar, OMG! We had lunch (with a incredible view) twice there. The food is amazing (10 stars to the pork sandwich and Hawaiian pizza) and my boyfriend said the drinks were also. On our check out day, since we have the room back at 11am but only needed to be at the airport at 8:30pm, we were able to use the hotel and they also provided us with a complimentary room for shower. It was great. Thanks!I only wish Marriott would provide beach chair and umbrella for free, like other hotels do.

Our flight from Sacramento arrived early and by the time we got to the hotel it was around 11.30am. We figured we were too early to checkin but gave it a shot knowing that we'd probably have to come back later.We were helped by the most wonderful lady named Anna. She was very polite and asked what brought us to Hawaii to switch I stated we are celebrating my 40th. She politely asked how many beds.... as a LGBT traveler this can sometimes be awkward however Anna was wonderful and made us feel super relaxed and welcomed. Anna informed us that she was upgrading our room to an ocean view and that it was ready right away. I was so thrilled and extremely thankful!!!!The next day we had been out exploring and came back to the room to find a bottle of wine, cheese, chocolate strawberries, a fruit platter and a hand written card! See pics. Omg I was just speechless!!!! This is truly the nicest thing any hotel has ever done for us! We have traveled all over the world and this is the one stay that I will never forget. I rushed down to the front desk to give Anna my thanks!I want to give my sincere thanks to Anna and all the staff at the Mariott Waikiki beach hotel and spa.

We stayed here for our 25th wedding anniversary which I mentioned upon booking.

We had no package; it was obviously a thoughtful gift for our anniversary. The rooms are quite spacious and have 50""(?) tvs. There is a small refrigerator and charging stations built into the bedside clocks. Also, there are reading lights attached to the headboards. The bathrooms are quite small and I banged into the toilet and tub on numerous occasions. There is only one concierge that I would recommend: Amanda. She is the only one who could answer every one of our questions and offer other suggestions to add to our itineray. I think I spoke with 5 or 6 other concierges during our stay. I had asked one of the young male concierges if we could get directions to somewhere in town. His answer was, ""don't you have a smart phone?"" Not the kind of response I would expect from a Marriott employee, especially one who works at an expensive hotel. As another reviewer said, the $37+/day resort fee is really steep. If you are going to charge this, then start by making sure your fitness center is clean (it was not) and there are services poolside (there was not).

Overall, my stay was good:The location of the hotel was perfect - at the end of the main strip of the Waikiki beach area directly across the street from Kuhio Beach, easily accessible with everything you could want within a one block walk without the hassle of being in the middle of busy one-way Waikiki streets, with gorgeous views overlooking the beach and looking towards Diamond Head.The hotel staff was pleasant and accommodating - any request I made of the front desk was honored, the bell staff and valet parking were pleasant and responsive, the gentleman who taught the lei making class was very nice with interesting stories about Hawaii and its culture, the bartenders at Moana Terrace, Sansei and the servers at Arancino di Mare were great, and the servers at Kuhio Beach Grill for the breakfast buffet were very nice but provided limited services (as expected at a buffet).The pool areas were nice and clean with plenty of lounge chairs and cabanas.Upon check-in, as a Marriott Rewards platinum member, I was upgraded from a City View room to an Ocean Front room on the 18th floor of the Kealohilani Tower. I was very happy with the upgrade, the view from my room was spectacular! I was also given a reusable water bag that could be filled at filling stations located throughout the ground floor of the hotel. I was given the option of 1,000 rewards points or the breakfast buffet for 2 for the duration of my stay as a welcome gift - I selected the breakfast.I dined at Arancino di Mara and Sansei Sushi Bar (I sat bartop) for dinner. Both restaurants were very good with great service.I had the breakfast buffet at the Kuhio Beach Grill most mornings. The buffet was decent with plenty of hot options, omelets made to order, fresh fruits & juices, and several bread offerings as well as miso soup and rice with toppings. The price was steep at $35 per person and, if it wasn't included I would have probably eaten elsewhere for breakfast.Why only 3.5 stars? The room, while clean with a comfortable bed, was seriously outdated. Just replacing the carpet would make a big difference. Also the bathroom area, with a walk-through vanity sink area to the toilet and shower, was very small - not what I would expect of a resort hotel. The room was not very soundproof. I could hear the person in the room next door snoring, and a toilet flushing from a nearby room. Loud sounds from the street were audible in the room as well.The $37 + tax per day resort fee was outrageous. The resort fee included: fitness and cultural classes daily, unlimited dvd rental, discounts at shops located at the hotel and one introductory scuba diving or snorkeling lesson - that's one per stay per room, not per day or per person staying in the room.The food at the Moana Terrace was expensive and uninspired. Marriott should be embarrassed for allowing such terrible food on its premises. As an example, the nachos were served with a bad cheese sauce and the sweet potato fries were stale or undercooked.I would stay at this location again, particularly if I was in town for business, but would readily consider other nearby options as well.","Hartford, Connecticut","04sox</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hartford, Connecticut</strong>",57,4.0

I loved the location: just one block from the beach, and there was tons of shops and restaurants along the strip. However be warned that on the Waikiki strip there are a LOT of homeless. They never exuded an air of danger, but it does make you feel a bit uncomfortable especially when they’re essentially lined up one after the other. The room was a little dated and darker than pictured in on the Marriott site, however even from the secondary tower you have a nice ocean view (there was even fireworks Wednesday night!). The WiFi worked great inside the room, but in the hallway it was nonexistent for some reason. It was fine in the main areas of the resort as well. There’s also a water refill station in the lobby, took me until day 4 or so to realize. Breakfast buffet was very good, loved that it started at 5AM since East Coast time had me waking up at 4:30. Great omelette station (though be warned the line can get LONG especially later in the morning), loved the fresh pineapple and pineapple juice, the cinnamon rolls are deceptively delicious. Though if you aren’t an elite member and get the free breakfast, $30 is too much in my opinion. There’s a Starbucks in the second tower if you aren’t into the pricey buffet, and a fast food joint on the corner. All in all, I’d stay here again, however if I were here on personal travel I feel the price is a bit much for rooms that are in need of a little polish and updating.

Three beds and one chair and the chair was extremely worn down there was hair and stains on the top sheet trash underneath the table dirt dust and hair stuck to the fire alarms bathroom floors that were dirty drains that were nasty. But this room didn't smell like poop. Shockingly bad if this was a roadside Inn but this is a resort in a city with the most ridiculous Hotel nightly rates they charge of ridiculous Resort fee. With all the options in this city this hotel shouldn't be considered. Things happen rooms can be dirty or have an odor...

It also right down the road from Diamond Head Crater and world class shopping. With its renovation a few years ago, the look of the resort has changed to one that is quite modern while still taking in the Aloha feel with beautiful local foliage. Being steps from the water only makes this the perfect choice when looking for accommodations in the Waikiki area. On property, you have Enterprise Rental for your car rental needs, which makes it very convenient. Taking a drive around the island is thus very easy. Also, there are several restaurants on property, but one of the favorites is the Moana Terrace. Here you can get lunch by the pool in a relaxed atmosphere. Having comfortable and beautiful rooms is very important, but due to the greatmanagement team of people like Chris Tatum (general manager) and Charlene Kamada (assistant), coming back year after year is a clear choice. This has been the location to celebrate special events in our family, and they have gone above and beyond. This is something that comes from the heart and that is why the property is so successful.

The next time your travels bring you to Waikiki, I definitely would suggest a stay at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort!!Now, for my detailed review:Having stayed at numerous properties in Waikiki over the years, I have seen it all; old, tiny and overpriced rooms at overcrowded properties offering lack-luster service. However, a recent stay required two nights in Waikiki at the tail-end of a vacation and I must say, the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort is a true exception to the usual chaos of Waikiki Resorts. This was a very brief stay, but in the two nights I had at this great property, I was truly impressed and although I am not a fan of Waikiki, I most certainly could see myself coming back to the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort!!The location of this property cannot be beat; it is at the Diamond Head end of Waikiki, allowing for easy access to Diamond Head, and it is within walking distance of the beautiful Honolulu Zoo! Just a few blocks down the street, you will find amazing shopping and dining at the International Marketplace. And, by far the best part of this property is its direct beach access; it is directly across the street from Waikiki Beach, allowing for a great beach day! Also, as some reviews have mentioned, being at the Diamond Head end of Waikiki means this property is away from a lot of the loud hustle-and-bustle of some of the other properties and makes for a very quiet and relaxing stay. All-in-all, this property has a GREAT location making it perfect for your next stay in Waikiki!As you enter the property, you will find yourself in a beautiful open-air lobby -- the Nanea Lobby -- which has been recently renovated and looks quite modern. You will find large and well-staffed check-in counters as well as a separate check-in area for Elite Tier members of the Marriott Rewards Program. And, although it was well-staffed and we did not have much of a wait, the staff was amazing and pro-active and would constantly walk through the check-in area passing out bottles of cold water as you wait. AMAZING service!Within a matter of moments after arrival, we were at the Front Desk and a very friendly agent explained the property to us and told us that our junior suite had one of the best possible views. He also explained the Resort Fee and its inclusions.Yes, this is a Resort Property in Hawaii, so you will have a Resort Fee -- like essentially every decent property in the area. The Resort Fee at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort is currently $37/day and includes:-Macadamia Nut Chocolate Amenity on Arrival (VERY tasty!!!)-Enhanced High-Speed WiFi-1 Introductory Snorkel or Scuba Lesson-Daily Fitness Classes-Daily Cultural Classes-60-minutes of long distance or international calls per day-Unlimited Blu-Ray/DVD RentalsAll-in-all, a decent list of inclusions. The Blu-Ray/DVD Rental is a VERY nice touch! All rooms at this property are equipped with Blu-Ray/DVD Players, and off of the lobby there is a Redbox-like machine which you are given access to via a card at check-in. Not bad to have such an option included with your Resort Fee!Also, as for the ""Enhanced High Speed WiFi"" -- unlike many properties that claim to offer such a feature, the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort truly does. You will find the property to have EXCELLENT WiFi speeds; we did not have any issues with connectivity or streaming throughout our stay!As for rooms on property, they are typical rooms of most Marriott properties; decent size (most are around approximately 350-square feet) and well-appointed. Each room features the typical plush Marriott bed and linens, as well as Marriott's new high-end internet televisions which offer a quality on-screen guide and the ability to access all types of streaming services. The bathrooms feature the Marriott Thann Bath Products, and each room also features a small mini-fridge. Finally, all rooms feature large curved balconies that offer great views of either the city or the ocean. All-in-all, quite nice rooms for the Waikiki Beach area!As for room view, this property has several varying views from two high-rise towers. Views range from City View to Ocean View to Diamond Head. All such views are amazing, but I would highly recommend splurging a bit for the Ocean View rooms as the height of these towers provides for truly spectacular views! Should you be here on a Friday, you would have amazing views of the Hilton Hawaiian's fireworks display!As for our room, we booked an Ocean Front Junior Suite, and we could not have been happier; it was an AMAZING room located high up in the Kealohilani Tower -- the tower closest to the ocean and beach. As you walk in, you enter into a sitting area with a bathroom off to the left. The bathroom had an over-sized double vanity, a shower, toilet and a deep soaking tub along with the mini-fridge. The sitting area offered a comfortable sofa-sleeper and a large curved balcony which offers spectacular views of the ocean, Waikiki Beach and also the city. As you progress further into the room, you find the ultra-plush and comfortable Marriott pillow-top King-bed along with a large work/computer desk, dresser and high-definition television. The room was equipped with ample lighting and electrical outlets -- unlike many local properties. Finally, one of the best features of this Ocean Front Junior Suite is the wall of windows facing out toward the ocean -- truly amazing views from bed! All-in-all, a truly wonderful room for the cost!As for dining during your stay -- in addition to all of the amazing local venues within walking distance -- the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort offers numerous excellent places to dine! First, do not miss the Kuhio Beach Grill, located on the second floor of the Kealohilani Tower; it offers an amazing breakfast buffet as well as a wonderful dinner buffet with varying themes each night. It is know for its Prime Rib Dinner, offered Monday-Thursdays at a great rate; as we were there during this period, we tried it and it was AMAZING! Additionally, the Moana Terrace Poolside Bar & Grill offers excellent drinks and dining with beautiful ocean views. For excellent sushi and seafood, don't miss Sansei Seafood Restaurant & Sushi Bar. Or, if Italian is your preference, the property also has Arancino di Mare. Finally, for coffee lovers, the property offers an on-site Starbucks.So, you most certainly will never go hungry during a stay at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort!Finally, the property offers a great deal of local shopping, such as one of Waikiki's many ABC Stores and a Honolulu Cookie Company. So, you are able to easily get a fair amount of shopping done during your stay!Oh, and a quick note on safety and service during Hurricane Issues. Our stay ended just prior to a Tropical Storm hitting the Islands. Throughout our stay, as the news hyped the potential effects of the storm, the property promptly and consistently updated its guests with daily information on the pending storm. I have stayed at numerous properties during hurricane season, and this property offered some of the most efficient and effective communication to its guests that I have ever seen! And, to make you understand how safe this property might be, we saw numerous FEMA Staff checking in during this period; so, if FEMA sends its people here, it must be one of the safer properties! That definitely put us at ease!!All-in-all, the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort is a truly great property, offering spectacular views from well-appointed rooms. It has great dining and stellar service and staff, and it truly should be the property of choice for your next stay in Waikiki!",Florida,"AttorneyVin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Florida</strong>",308,5.0

Clean room. Great View of the beach and Friday night Fireworks.Cons: The daytime bartender in the Moana Terrace Bar is a butthead. He will not allow you to leave your bar tab open unless you actually sit at the bar. We were in one of the cabanas and he would not allow us to leave our bar tab open. The evening bar tender allowed us to leave our tab open when we were in the smoking area. The smoking area is awful. There are only three wooden seats and they are so uncomfortable. Also, we were smoking cigars and there are no ashtrays for cigar butts so you have to cram them into these small slits made for cigarettes. If the sun is out and you want to smoke you have to do it with the sun beating down on you because there is no cover for the smoking area. One night we were out smoking cigars and it started to rain. All we could do is move to a place under cover. One of the workers walked by and made a comment about us being there, but what else are we supposed to do. When you smoke a cigar, it's not a 2 second smoke like cigarettes. I think the hotel could at least make the smoking area more comfortable and put up some type of shade and rain protection for smokers. And get some ashtrays for cigar smokers.All in all, we were very pleased with the hotel and our stay there. The food in all the restaurants in the hotel was very good.

Pool drinks: could have been better. Pool area: clean, nice, comfy chairs, waiters. Cabana’s available. Laundry: we used it. Was 100 feet from the pool on the same deck. Safe to leave clothes. Only $4 a load. Not too bad. They also have dry cleaning but like everywhere it was $$$. Food: we only ate at the pool deck. The nachos were good. But the service and location and view was the point. Lobby: beautiful, roomy, very Hawaii. They had activities on a weekly calendar, yoga, even rental cars available in the hotel. Tour concierges, 2 Starbucks, 2 ABC Stores, souvenir and jewelry stores. The ABC store was nice to buy towels, medical stuff, WATER and sunscreen. Room: we had an ocean view down Waikiki towards the Royal Hawaii. Very nice view. Watched the sunset a few times from our balcony. The room needs updating though. Especially the bathroom. *But guess what- you are in Waikiki on Oahu with too much to see and do. So we weren’t there much at all. As far as the location and the amenities you can’t beat it! It was a big hotel. Not a resort.

The pool bar was good with happy hour from 3-6 which is a good deal and nice menu for pool bar. Good view of the water for sunset from pool bar. Room was spacious and clean - no complaints.

Rooms are only partially updated and ocean view wing rooms are due for full update in October. Can’t wait to see it then. Took 1 star off for the location. Location: while address is on Kalakaua Ave (oceanfront), main entrance is off a side street. The hotel is located pretty far down the east end of Waikiki. It’s a longer walk than I expect to main part of Waikiki for food and shopping (especially in the heat or rain). It initially didn’t seem that far, but it is if you walk it multiple times. A lot of the shops on the east end are very touristy and not updated, so you really would want to shop in the more central part of Waikiki for best selections.I usually stay at the Westin Moana Surfrider or the Hyatt Resort, which is so near Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and International Marketplace, just a little more convenient for food and shopping. But I was able to get the Marriott for a much better rate than the other two. Unlike the Westin which is truly beachfront, both this Marriott and Hyatt resorts are across the street from the beach. But it’s a very short walk. Other than location, love everything else here.Parking: Like all of Waikiki resorts, parking is highway robbery, but no choice. Self park is $40 daily and valet is $45. The parking area has a long semi-circular driveway, so plenty of room for cars, never feel jammed (unlike Westin and Hyatt). The valet staff is also very quick in getting us our car every day (it takes 15-20 mins at the other two). Resort fee: many Waikiki hotels’ resort fee of $35-37 daily is separate from parking. So remember to include this in your pricing decisions. Resort fee covers local calls (only useful for international travelers), free activities classes, spa discount, free newspapers and DVD rentals and shopping discounts. We didn’t use any of them.Check-in: There’s a separate platinum desk and a Japanese speaking desk. A day prior to arrival, I texted the Marriott staff to make request for early check in and King bed room. The chat team was quick to respond and room was ready and as request upon arrival. Totally awesome. Common Area: spacious seating and tables in the open air main lobby. Starbucks on site. Very clean and surprisingly quiet. A few touristy shops on site. Platinum Elite Upgrade: so with the new Marriott SPG merger, premier upgrades will be interesting to see. We were offered an ocean front king room, no suite. When we stayed at the Hyatt before, as a top tier elite member, we’ve almost always gotten a suite upgrade. So FYI.There’s also no elite lounge (both Westin and Hyatt do), but elite member can choose points or free breakfast. We got the food and it covers breakfast buffet for 2, all you can eat.Bell staff: very quick and efficient at both check in and check out.Room: We’re in the ocean front tower, which is furthest from the main lobby. Room was good size and has a spacious balcony that overlooks Waikiki beach. Due to the location of the tower, you get an Ewa view (no Diamond Head view). The room has a comfy king size bed, huge LCD TV, long desk and drawers, mini-fridge for your use, club chair, balcony furniture, closet with robes and slippers, safe. Carpet looks pretty new and linens were soft.Bathroom: typical Marriott layout, with single sink right outside separate room for toilet and tub with shower. It’s average size, feel tight with 2 people in it. Food: we only had breakfast here and the buffet had a good selection of American and Asian food options. There’s also an omelette station. Service was quick and food was tasty. There’s also a bar there, so you can get a cocktail or beer.Overall, we had a very good stay. Solid value and we would stay here again. But if the price was the same, I might choose the Westin or Hyatt instead due to the location and elite amenities.Picture us view from our room balcony during Hurricane Olivia.","Los Angeles, California","LuvtoSafari</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",417,4.0

The room was spacious with a couch to watch TV (never turned it on) and coffee maker with coffee, there is a safe in the room for valuables if needed. After shooting some photos of the room and looking out on the balcony we decided to go to the beach. The beach is right across the street from the hotel and the streets were busy with tourists. I found it kinda on the crowded side and we had to find a spot to put our stuff down on the beach. We still had plans on getting in the water that way... ""Yes I have gone swimming at Waikiki Beach"". I was in only maybe 5-10 minutes and called it quits and my wife only got her feet wet. That area is good for kids and certain people who don't like waves, kinda like a big bathtub. I could not go to the other side of the Waikiki Wall and Queen's Beach and play in the waves since I was nursing a broken rib from a few days ago..bummer!! Back at the hotel we decided to go and get something to eat, there is a big digital map / locator hanging on the wall and you click on it for what you want to do.. go eat! A lists comes up and it shows you how to get there... cool! We came back down and went out on the beach to catch the sunset but I only brought my smart phone out to the beach... still a Nice sunset!In the room the Air-conditioning is pointed at the bed, I think there needs to be a way to point it away or up. We had to get up early and be on our way by 05:30 and of course it was pouring rain outside. I called down and by the time we got there our rental car was waiting.

We took limited items as we did not know what to expect, but overall the area did seem safe full of tourists. There are some homeless people around, but they do not seem to bother people. We were able to walk to various stores and restaurants within 10 minutes and there is plenty to pick from. We had the continental breakfast that does have about a 15 minute wait, it is pretty standard breakfast nothing special.

ONce you leave the hotel turn left and you will find Wolfgang Pucks Express and Jamba Juice, great for taking to the beach.We however did only eat at the hotel once and that was for breakfast as we had no choice due to everything being closed due to hurricane lane.

To be fair, it’s best to compare to other hotels in the same price range. The normal rate range in 2018 is $200 to $300/ night. For this price you get a great location across the street from the beach, a big pool, big rooms (albeit old), an outdoor lounge with live music. Another comparable hotel in this category is the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani (see my reviews). As a Platinum Marriot/ Starwood member, they still give the breakfast/ dinner coupons. The buffets are decent (think Las Vegas buffet) and who can complain when it’s free ? If you want a Five Star hotel then you need to go elsewhere and pay at least double the price.

Hurricane Lane never really arrived, but most stores and restaurants closed anyway. Marriott kept a couple of restaurants open throughout so there were options for eating, though they were expensive and didn't have much in the way of vegan options. Our best meal was at Sansei, the sushi place. The room was nice, with a good bed, reasonable bathroom amenities, and a balcony just big enough to have breakfast on (for two), with a great view of the ocean. I fed some pigeons on the balcony the first day and the clever little buggers were waiting for me, looking through the glass door, every morning thereafter. There was coffee service in the room which I appreciated, and I bought soymilk at the Starbucks (in the lobby) to put in my coffee. The hotel is close to the beach, shops, restaurants, and more. A friend of mine has a house on Diamondhead and we chose to stay at the Marriott instead because of its proximity to the Waikiki beaches with their surf lessons, board rentals, and general bustle of happy activity. The beaches here are sooooo good for kids. Plenty of white sand, lifeguards, activities, and just enough surf to bounce around in on a tube, or if you want to paddle out (and have some surfing skills), you could catch some epic waves. Pro tip: The ABC stores that are on every block (there are TWO in this hotel complex!!) have nice inflatable tubes for $3.99 (we bought several), snorkel and mask sets for $19.99, and you can find boogie boards in the area starting at $19.99 so you don't need to travel with any of that. There is also a Mexican Grill a block away that is a LOT like Chipotle, which is a nice option for kids. The parking, however, is going to cost you -- $40 for self park, $45 for valet. Ouch. Suggestion for the management: More vegan options on the menus would be appreciated. And yeah, I know that I can ask the waiter or chef to accomodate us, but why not just put something right there, on the menu? It's better that way. :)",NYC,"travelingmomNYC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NYC</strong>",91,4.0

Further, they have tried to explain the breakfast situation, bottom line, you will get some coupons for breakfast to offset the resort fee, but you should get that anyways (platinum) so it’s just a 37 dollar fee to them.

We didn't have high expectations to be honest and thought that it would be fine for just one night. I have to say they exceeded our expectation in every way. 1) check-in: smooth, friendly and efficient - Kenneth at the front desk was amazing. He took the time to check us into our two rooms, accommodated our request of connecting rooms, explained Elite benefits (which I didn't know I was a part of), and told us that the hotel will be going through renovations and that we should come back when it's complete (we sure will!) He was just super friendly and kind. He really set the tone for the rest of our experience at the hotel.2) luggage and parking: again, employees were just above and beyond friendly, always ready to help and our luggage person came up to our room with bottles of cold water and explained the activities in the area. Really helpful and friendly.3) location of the hotel - smack in the middle of everything. We were at the Modern the night before and really the locations of the two hotels don't compare in terms of convenience. This hotel is truly in the middle of everything you want to be close to.4) rooms - I've read everywhere that the rooms were tired and outdated so I didn't expect much, but the rooms were actually quiet good - spacious, clean, huge TVs. I can't wait to come back after the renovations but the rooms were really fine the way they were. Our rooms faced the ocean and the diamond head and it was great.5) the lobby - huge, beautiful, calm and great for people watching. Overall the hotel was great beyond my expectations and we would be sure to return. One more thing - this is not a big deal but the hotel waived their resort fees for the hurricane, which I thought was a very classy gesture.

To offer this discount but not tell guests nor print it on the welcome letter or resort fee card is dishonest. When I complained the manager on duty apologized but didn't adjust my bill. He did send a ""complimentary"" bottle of wine to my room, which was a nice gesture until I looked the brand up and found out it was a $6-9 bottle of sparking wine. Really?

The yogurt is cheap. The juice isn't even fresh squeezed. I fully understand that this is a busy property with lots of elite status guests every night.

As far as amenities and facilities the hotel is fine but nothing too special. Showers and bathrooms are of an older style. I feel the price value is lacking but it is probably just a hawaii thing. I live in Asia where 200 a night will get you a very nice five star hotel so it’s a bit of a shocker to spend 300 a night for a four / three star hotel experience.

Literally right across the street is the banyan Waikiki garage where you can pay 30 dollars a day or 110 for a weekly pass, a much better option and the one we took.

No shortage of options, both upscale and reasonable.Also hiked Diamond Head although it’s really a walk with a few steep steps and narrow passages..

The resort was really nice, but my reason for giving it 4 stars is that although the room was clean, it along with the bathrooms needs to be renovated. The bathrooms are very small and you don't have much privacy because the sink is separate from the bathroom. Also when I booked my room, I specifically asked for 2 queen beds with an ocean view. When we checked in, my friend and I were given a room with a king bed. That issue was resolved with double queen beds with a view of Diamond Head and the ocean. My other issue was the $353 incidental charge that had to be paid upfront. I was aware of the $37 daily resort fee, but not the incidental charge. Thankfully I will get that back within 10 business days. Overall, I had a wonderful stay and everyone from housekeeping to the concierge staff were very friendly and helpful with whatever issues/questions we had. The hotel is in a good location, although it was further from what I consider the main part of Waikiki (international market, Ala Moana mall and surrounding areas).

I’m still peeved that neither our travel agent nor the hotel highlighted this charge or the services that were included in the fee. The charges to use a lounge at the pool were also excessive.

It was easy to get towels to use for day trips or the beach. The location is great too as it’s close to lots of sights and restaurants. We ate at the pool restaurant one night and the food was great and they had live entertainment which is always nice. The parking is $40 per day which is steep, but not many alternatives.

A few things to remember: ABC store is street level facing Waikiki beach. The pools are on the 3rd floor (I think). We mainly swam in the pool next to the ""cafe."" It was great. We swam at night as were entertained by live music. The gym is nicely appointed. It's got lots of machines, treadmills, and the such. Free weights were a bit lacking, but the other machines more than made up for it. It's located next to the other pool (tower 2). We stayed in an ocean view room and weren't disappointed.

At check in, there was a snafu with our tour agency reserved rooms. The room reservations were in the system, but there was a question about for how many nights. The front dest lady waiting on us was plain rude. Although we had two rooms reserved as a party (same reservation number), she demanded that one us get out of line and ""wait our turn"" it seems she couldn't possibly check in both parties at the same time. I went next to another desk person who looked at the reservation and after a few minutes of searching, decided I needed to go back to the other lady since the reservation number was the same as my other family member. Mercifully, the original grouchy lady decided she could arrange for both our check ins.The rooms were clean enough but obviously in need of refurbishing. The carpeting and furniture upholstery were somewhat worn. The bathroom is from an earlier era where it seemed acceptable for the commode to block use of half of the double sink (not to mention not having the commode in it's own private cubicle separate from the sink and shower like we'd just had at our Maui Resort). There were several restaurant and shopping options on the property, which was convenient. The pool area offered good seating with a wonderful ocean view.

Great brand and hotel chain. After staying at a different hotel in my first leg of the trip and how great there customer service was, I was truly looking forward to to my stay here. It all started when I arrived at the hotel for check in. I was rudely greeted by the front desk. I told her it was my first time here but she didn’t seem to care. I was handed my room key, a pack of papers and that was it. I asked where the elevators were and was told over there! Note: there are at least two towers and they don’t connect so later in the night I was lost trying to get back to my room.When I got my room I reviewed my papers. First thing I looked at was a list of the resort activities included. The first thing on the list was supposed to be a chocolate at check in. Wasn’t given this when I checked in and not surprised by the way I was treated. It is ridiculous that YOU pay a resort fee and the hotel doesn’t honor it. No one would know what the resort fee includes prior to checking in to the hotel. You get a DVD card to rent DVDs but wasn’t told about that feature or even where to go to use it. The room had an odd odor in it. Not sure if it was a floral perfume or mold or a combination of both. The bath room is very dated. Also if you are tall you can’t see your head in the mirror. Th bed sheet had a stain on the right side of the bed. DO NoT stay here as there are other hotels out there that are cleaner and the staff is much more friendlier. Also, you will see the Marriott manger of this hotel respond with a canned verbiage response saying they will look into these areas or that they are redoing the rooms in October 2018 just like the other people who give poor reviews.

Probably the best feature is the balconies which are great to sit on, and that the rooms are relatively spacious.We reserved the highest room category, ocean front in the front tower. When we arrived I was somewhat disappointed as although it was technically an oceanfront room in the sense that it looked out to the ocean without obstruction, there were literally 50-100 rooms that were closer to the ocean and had a better view of Waikiki. I somewhat doubt that these rooms were all occupied by people who had shelled out for the top room category. In advance of staying at the hotel, I contacted them on three separate occasions for as high a floor as possible but will still only allocated level 13 out of 25 floors. Admittedly I am only a silver member but still I had somewhat higher hopes..I’m not sure what you have to do to get the higher floors.I did receive one breakfast voucher daily as an elite member, which went beyond the strict entitlement I had not being gold or above and so I was grateful for that. The hotel was at 97% capacity which meant that one day we had to wait approximately 20 minutes for a table.Probably the biggest issue we had was noise. We could easily hear conversations coming from the next room, through the interconnecting door, and the noise from their TV when it was turned on. There was also a lot of noise coming up from the pool, which does not close until 11pm. Finally, the water pipes are very loud whenever the rooms above or next door use water. Interestingly, the kids staying in the interconnecting room to outs had their family staying in another room down the hall without an interconnecting door.. with a bit of planning the hotel could have given us a quieter room that didn’t interconnect and the family could have been together. I really like Marriott and this hotel is an OK option for expensive Waikiki, particularly in terms of its location and the surrounding amenities.

Our request for our rooms to be close to each other was organised and ready on arrival and it was a nice surprise to have been given a connecting room as part of that request. We had a problem with our toilet which was fixed immediately. Only issue was giving the Resort our credit card details to hold for any expenses to our room and after staff advising there would be no charge made to our card, discovering that a large amount had in fact been charged.

The staff was helpful (if understaffed) - the location was convenient (on the Diamond Head end of Waikiki, so easy to access the rest of Waikiki without feeling trapped in it) and overall it was a very pleasant business trip. It was however, not without frustrations. I would caveat this by saying that were I to stay for vacation in Oahu, Waikiki would be my LAST choice. Waikiki is dense, touristy, and crowded and many of my frustrations were the result of those disadvantages.--Firstly, the elevators. There's not enough elevators for the number of floors the hotel has, and if one or more is out of order, you can easily finding yourself waiting 10-15 minutes to catch a lift to or from your room. This is by no means a deal-breaker for me, I'm not averse to walking upwards of 15 flights of stairs, however every time my patience ran out with the elevators and I tried to take the stairs, I found them both hard to find and harder to navigate. Several times I would find myself in the employees only areas of the hotel, wandering into housekeeping or human resources just trying to find my way out to a level that takes me to the ground floor. Not all stairs connect to a guest exit - and none of the stairwells are well posted with signs. The stairs are also terribly dirty - on one occasion I could have sworn there was human feces in them by the odor. PRO TIP: If the elevators are being terribly slow, take the lobby stairs up to the third floor - they show up much faster to the third floor than they do to the lobby.--Secondly, the concierge. The concierges were all extremely helpful, HOWEVER, they're terribly understaffed for such a high volume hotel. They have a couple desks (not always staffed), but almost all the time they're occupied, and usually with a line. It can be really time-consuming to be able to speak with someone about booking excursions or getting general help. More concierge staff would go a LONG way.--The pool. There are two pools, both are rather small and both can get very crowded (especially the one hot tub at night). Most of the pool space consists of row after row of pool chairs stacked together like sardines, without any shade. There are cabanas, which are usually empty, but you have to pay for these. The pool area is definitely underwhelming.--Parking. Self parking sucks. It takes a while to drive up the cramped, tight parking lot and often you get to the top to discover it's full (there's a sign out front that says when it's full, but isn't always reliable) Valet if you can. The valets are great and it's super convenient.Overall, if you HAVE to stay in Waikiki you can do worse. I would stay there again for business, though if I was on vacation, I'd opt for something a bit nicer outside of Waikiki.","Los Angeles, California","killergiraffes94</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",83,3.0

First, usually for elite members, the Marriott brand of hotels gives two free breakfasts per day (complimentary). Just because they add the word “resort” to it, that’s the excuse to renegotiate and only give one free breakfast per day. This definitely puts a bad taste in my mouth as a loyal Marriott elite member. They also charge for kids under 12 for breakfast. The Sheridan hotels don’t.Second, they charge you $40/night for self parking, or $45/night for valet (really $50/night with expected tips). This is robbery. They also charge a $37/day resort fee which is just an excuse to charge you more for services you would get for free at any other Marriott. Third, hotel is not on the beach. You have to cross the street to get to the beach.Fourth, customer service is good. Phoebe at the elite desk did her utmost and got us a corner room with a view of the city, ocean and two queen beds. She rocks.Fifth, rooms are a bit run down. Bathroom shower is a disgusting mold fest. Hard to open sliding door patio. Nobody mans the swimming pool for handing out towels. The toilet is exceptionally loud when flushed. The air conditioning doesn’t do a great job at keeping room cool. Also people smoke in these rooms (even though they are considered non smoking rooms). So if you have a connecting door, the other rooms smoke will seep in your room.Overall - I’m considering moving my loyalty from Marriott to Hilton because of this experience.","San Diego, California","46130ew</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",51,3.0

First off, the beach across the street is awful. It has a seawall that traps water allowing marginal exchange with the ocean. You can almost smell the urine. For people who like to swim in the ocean, a hotel further west on the strip would be better.The next is in the area of the parking rate and the involuntary extortion--oops, I meant the hotel resort fee. Come on, Marriott, just add it to the room price and don't make your loyal customers feel like victims. Likewise the parking: give us Silver and Gold members some kind of a break!I could live with the above problems and, in fact, we have; this was our third stay at this property in the last 10 years. But it pains me to say this. On our next visit we will stay at either the Hilton or Trump hotels for one reason only: that is because of the harassment my wife (especially) and I got every single time we walked across the first floor to the elevators from the girls selling some sort of beauty products at a shop called Truffior. Even if we walked as far as possible across the floor they would literally holler at us trying to hawk their wares. One evening, after stopping at the ABC store, two of these land sharks tag-teamed my wife, in spite of her asking them to leave her alone, and bringing her almost to tears!

Our room was upgraded and we had an amazing view. The staff was super friendly from the moment we checked in until we checked out. The rooms and facilities were clean and welcoming. The pool is small but there are two different pools to choose from. There are restrooms located all around the property. There are great options for dining around the hotel. We got all our kids mcd's which was a couple blocks away. We also got take out from sansei and sat poolside and ate our food. We listened to live music and had a couple cocktails at the pool bar. The sunset view is amazing too. For the size of the hotel nothing was too crowded and the elevators were fast. I think the only downside to the hotel is that the beds were not very comfortable but we didn't go on a staycay to sleep our time away. We lounged on the balcony and soaked up the sun, walked around waikiki and swam. The location of the property is great. In my opinion it has the best access to waikiki without being in the center of the chaos.

The hotel is on the main drag in Waikiki so it’s very convenient to restaurants, the beach, the zoo, and plenty of shopping.We were actually able to check in early, which was a plus. They also let us check out late on our final day. They have parking, but if you valet park it’s $45 a day, $43 if you use their parking. It’s worth using valet as they can pull your car up as many times as you need. The valet staff was very professional.Since we are Marriott Rewards Members we could use the special checkin line, which saved time. The have a concierge in both of the lobbies, to help with booking tours. They were very helpful. In fact the lady we used was the best of our whole trip! Very helpful in making our choices.The rooms are OK. Older Marriott furniture, small bathroom, bathtub had scars/scratches on the tub. Not enough room on vanity for toiletries. They have a small fridge, and a huge HD TV. If you need bigger beds ask for queens, we had smaller than queen and it was a little tight. You can get king beds too.Most rooms have balcony’s, with great views of the ocean if you request it; but it’s not free, they charge you $45 a night for ocean view. A bit steep.You can print airline boarding passes, Swim in one of their two pools, go to Starbucks, right in the hotel. The breakfast buffet is really overpriced. We got two days free due to Marriott points, but I would not spend $28 a piece for this buffet. Not when there are so many close options (McDonalds, Starbucks).Location is key and this place has it! I’d probably stay here again, but see if I could get a room without having to pay the up charge for ocean view. I don’t think any of the rooms have been remodeled in a while, based on the couple of rooms we saw.If you have young kids don’t let them on the balcony by themselves. The railing is lower and kind of flimsy. Newer hotels have to raise the railing, and make it more secure.","Naples, Florida","672donaldm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Naples, Florida</strong>",191,4.0

The room had a king bed, beautifully made up and A+.Room: Large, plenty of space and clean. Room key system has been updated and is better than the old system. The TV was very large and nice to watch. Very old carpeting which used to have giant ripples that were a tripping hazard. The carpet in my room had been restretched and had ripped and separated leaving a large hole in it next to the bed. Lanai: The best feature of the room. Large and has a chaise lounge which many hotels don’t have. Great place to eat and relax.Service: The maids were friendly and pleasant. Location: Good location in that it is close to the beach and less crowded than other places but a major problem with homeless people who are more than just homeless, they have mental health issues.Recommendations: Having a giant TV monitor (no remote) in the lobby area that plays FOX TV non stop is awful. To be honest they also have another monitor playing CNN. It might be a good idea to abandon political TV and go with HGTV and ESPN. You will offend fewer people. Do a better job with enforcing non-smoking policy and explain to people that it includes the lanais.

We enjoyed exceptional service everywhere, and its proximity to the beach is great. Several ABC stores on and near the property mean you can buy beer and wine and whatever else at store prices, which were comparable to mainland prices, without being forced to buy at resort prices. Walking down the strip to fine restaurants, beach bars, and shopping is easy, not far at all. We decided to upgrade to beach view and were glad we did. Patios on these rooms have beautiful views. Poke and fish tacos, yum. Breakfast buffet was amazing. Housekeeping thorough and so courteous.It was fun surfing, my wife's first time, I am fairly experienced. You can rent a board everywhere. As the beginners surfing capital of the world, be careful. Hundreds of surfers, not kidding. We saw an outrigger canoe with ten or so aboard riding a wave go right over a poor surfer who didn't realize he needed to get out of the way. His head went right between the hull and the outrigger and his board bounced of the bow. Man, he could have been killed. The canoe riders couldn't have cared less, they have the right of way, and blew a conch before riding the wave. Surfer's fault. Be careful.I must acknowledge the service from Jeane and Lea at check in, Russell the bellman, Chloe the server at the hotel bar and restaurant that overlooks the beach, and Sarah at the ATC(?) store inside the hotel (Kamsahamnida!) who was great with helping pick out a flowery dress and shoes, and Ricky at Sansei.

She insisted the walk-in tickets were misleading and they hardly had them and we should go through a tour which would cost us $60 a person. After swiping our credit card the total was $72 plus tax person... and of course no refunds. And when we arrived at Pearl Harbor the day of, there were still plenty of walk-in tickets available.

Modern lobby and typical 4 star hotel rooms. Front desk staff was cheerful and helpful. Most rooms (80% or so) offer some sort ocean view, with the tower closer to the ocean offer a wider viewing angle (room classified as ocean view, or the few room directly facing the ocean classified as premium ocean), while the mountain side tower offers a sliver of an ocean view (rooms classified as city view) and slightly smaller rooms.F&B: Kuhio Beach Grill serves buffet breakfast and dinner on level 2. Hotel breakfast vouchers are for this location. Made to order omelets by an entertaining and efficient chef. Not a huge selection, but a good mix of the standard hot foods, fruits, and pastries. At $35, would be tough to justify with the many nearby breakfast options. Despite it being a cattle call from 8AM-9AM (go early or late), staff managed the crowd with a smile. Shout out to Regina, full of aloha. Buffet dinner at $50 is a better deal, with prime rib and snow crab legs or other rotating specialty, but again, there are plenty of nearby options.On premise, but managed separately, are Sansei (Japanese fusion), DK Steakhouse, and Arancino di Mare, all high quality options where locals would go out of their way to eat at. You may even be able to room charge. Very special early bird, but requires a local ID. Late night happy hour for all.Amenities: Two quaint sized pools and a jacuzzi. Respectable gym.

Of course there’s an ABC store or two and a Starbucks or two in the hotel along with various other shops. Although it’s not directly on the beach it’s right across the street so wasn’t a long walk at all. Hotel lobby is large and well decorated and staff was very friendly from the valet, check in, restaurant staff to housekeeping. I had two rooms in the Kealohilani Tower and with my status we received upgrades on both rooms to ocean view and an ocean view suite. The regular ocean view room was very roomy, bed comfortable, but my only complaint was it a bit dated and needed an upgrade. Tub and fixtures were old and worn. Nonetheless the view from our room was perfect. One of the nights there was even a fireworks show on the beach right across the street and the view from our balcony was just perfect. The hotel pool was kinda small but there were a good amount of lounge chairs and bungalows to rent. Drink service at the pool was sparse but once you were able to flag down a waiter or waitress the drinks kept coming and the pool food was surprisingly good although service stopped too early.

I bad gone back and forth between booking the Moana Surfrider and ultimately my husband's Marriott elite status won. We booked a 'ocean view room'. We checked in online via the app and got to the resort about 1pm and were told the computers were down and they did not know if any upgrades were available or if the room we actually had was available due to this computer outage. Knowing that an early check in is not always a guarantee anyway and more of an elite perk, we went down the way for lunch. It was nice to be able to leave our bags and change in the Hospitality Lounge which has showers; dressing room and even an iron. After lunch it was now after 3pm and we wanted our room. Well, the system was still down. Our room was not even close to an ocean view; it was partial, at best. Not what we booked and facing another building. The bathroom was tiny., separate is the sink area for makeup and what not and it's small too. The coffee maker had to be plugged in over here, as no plug exists under the place they have it stored. The room itself was basic. The two beds were not even queens they were doubles. I knew it was not an upgraded room , BUT, we were in Hawaii... and their system was down. Do we want to spend our time complaining? No. When my husband called to ask about the room the response was that we could move to a panoramic view tomorrow but we would have to come downstairs with all of our bags and check back into the new room. Not doing that., as it takes away from island time. Our first night was incredibly loud as the building across is a bar with live music. It goes until past 0100am. Due to my husband's status with Marriott, We were given one breakfast coupon pp p day. Usually due to my husband's status when no Club is on property the option of drink coupons; points; or breakfast is given and it's usually for two. Mind you the breakfast buffet was $35 each without a coupon. We used them in one day and there is no way I thought this buffet was worth that much.. But, yes, it was good. I guess we just don't eat that much. Would you pay $35 for Embassy Suites breakfast that's included with the room rate ? This buffet is on par with that. Good but not $35 pp good. The Moana Terrace is a great place on property for drinks and apps. Has a great view of the beach and ocean. The Sensei Sushi Restaurant is also very good. The hotel is across the street from the small beach which is public.. so with that hefty resort fee, you get no beach chairs, etc. Like some hotels down the way, ( Moana Surfrider or Royal Hawaiian;)). The pool sits back from the beach viewing and is pretty basic and nothing amazing. There did not seem to be pool service for drinks but the bar is near. You get complimentary classes like Hula or Lei making that run from 0930-1030 or yoga or zumba and some discounts on excursions that can be booked at the resort. We thought that these discounts would be applied, however, as we booked two. Nope. They were not. Ask when booking as Amanda the Concierge was great but did not apply these discounts or ask when booking and after, it's too late. There is a Starbucks and ABC on property and a Honolulu Cookie on the corner too. All in all this resort just did not excite me and for a few bucks more we could have had a true resort experience with stepping out of resort on to the sand. This hotel for having status left us under whelmed with the computer system and blah room which was not an ocean view as we booked and felt like a business hotel room. Status or not, we probably won't book here on our next stay in Hawaii.","Phoenix, Arizona","kimberlyvickers06</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",49,3.0

Perhaps I have been spoiled by some of the premier properties I've had the blessing of staying at, but this hotel missed that ""something"" that made it special. Still, it was a good place overall.Check-in was fine, though robotic, especially compared to the awesome people at the Marriott on Maui. I was given a room upgrade to an ocean view room on the 19th floor as a Marriott Gold member. I guess it did have a view of the ocean, through the neighboring skyscrapers. It left a lot to be desired and the ocean was pretty far away. I couldn't hear the waves crashing over the street noise down below. A room on a higher floor would have cut down on the noise, but alas that was not to be on this stay.The room featured 2 double beds, which were just okay comfort wise with just a thin sheet as a comforter. The shower was one of the adjustable handicapped shower heads, with poor water pressure. The room was merely adequate and far from special.You need to cross a busy street to get to the beach, which was disappointing. At least the (public) beach was nice with good sand. The location of the hotel is convenient to many shops and restaurants, and there are several within the hotel.I was granted complimentary breakfast (see my separate review) as a Gold member, which was appreciated.

Given that they managed to accommodate a plane-load of people at relatively short notice, they did well. However, the decor was a strange mix of modern and 1970s. The bathroom door was a sliding wooden door that didn't really close properly. Having just stayed a week at the Courtyard by Marriott Waikiki, it was easy to compare. The Courtyard's decor was much more up-to-date. The room sizes were similar, but to be fair, the bed and pillows at the Marriott were more comfortable. However, the shower and hairdryer at the Courtyard were better - at the Marriott we had a shower over the tub. While the Marriott is nice and close to Waikiki beach, it is quite a walk to shops and restaurants. The Courtyard's location is more central. The Marriott has plenty of shops inside, so maybe the idea is you would not need to leave.

Plenty of dining options all around and there are ABC stores that sell snacks, sandwiches, fruit plates, salads, drinks etc., everywhere including two on the ground floor of the hotel itself.Beware that the hotel buildings (2 towers) are sited perpendicular to the beach. So most of the rooms, all of which seem to have balconies, while called Ocean View, are located down the sides of the towers and while they do offer views of the ocean from the balconies, you have to press yourself against the window and crane your neck sideways to see the ocean. We had to upgrade to a superior room to get the full on ocean view we wanted.Beware also that many hotels in Waikiki charge a resort fee that is not likely quoted in the room price if you book through an internet site such as Expedia. The resort fee at the Marriott is $38 per day plus tax and you don't really get anything for it other than excellent WiFi.Great views of the sunset from the pool deck and good entertainment every night is provided.Honolulu is fabulous but not cheap, and the Marriott Waikiki Beach is a great place to stay.","Nanoose Bay, Canada","Bob C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nanoose Bay, Canada</strong>",15,5.0

It was an okay stay and I hope what I am experiencing isn't typical, but it sounds like a systemic issue. First though, the overview:Pros: - The room I had was very comfortable and had a great view.- Free wifi with okay coverage. - Parts of the lobby have a nice relaxed feel, especially around the reception area.- Good on-site amenities and tenant shops (ABC store, Starbucks)- Food at restaurants on-property were good, service varied from good to poor (see more below).- Gym / Fitness center has a nice selection of workout equipment. - Very close to the beach (without having a private beach area)- You can easily sign into your own netflix account on the TVCons: - Resort is a misnomer - yes there are pools, but overall it has the feel more of a mid-range shopping center than a resort. Wouldn't mind except you pay an extra $37 for a mandatory resort fee. - Maid service was generally okay but missed some things like new lids for the coffee cups. - Although elevators are numerous and fast, they are small and you're likely to wait a few minutes to board, especially at peak times. - Although rooms have good AC, the elevators and the gym / fitness center lack A/C or any apparent ventilation. - While the hot tub/jacuzzi is nicely heated and decently sized it's quite uncomfortable, with little about its design that lends itself to relaxing. Not sure if it's just me but I spent most of the time having to find ways to prop myself up against the stone sides. - The parking garage is a total mess and in need of a major overhaul. While there are signs that the elevators inside the garage are being replaced and it sometimes looks like you can hope a shuttle from the 10(th?) you're more likely to need to take a concrete side stairwell, stepping through pooled water. It's probably structurally sound, but the contrast between the dank, dark concrete structure and adjoining hotel can be jarring. I won't dink it for the tight turns and difficulty finding a parking spot on the lower levels as that's somewhat expected in the area, just plan extra time to get in and out of the garage if you self-park (you can valet if you prefer).The Big Con: *Beware*: Anyone is apparently able to charge something to your hotel room simply by being choosing your room and signing for it. No ID for verification is required. This I need to explain in more of a narrative fashion. The last night of my work trip, my co-worker and I shared an appetizer and had a few drinks at the poolside bar. It was a pretty busy night so I was initially forgiving of the slow service (I'm pretty patient and the humid spell had finally turned into a nice night), but eventually we grew frustrated waiting to flag down the waitress for the check as she'd mostly disappeared from view. Once we did get the check we paid cash, not wanting to have to wait for her to have to run the credit card so we could make it to dinner in time. The next morning I awoke hoping to use the gym and received the itemized hotel statement and noticed it included a $198 charge from the same poolside bar. I was a bit perplexed how this could have happened until I asked tried to dispute the charge with the receptionist. She showed me a receipt for the charges, with a lot of Jack Daniels and hot dogs (kind of a weird combo) and the receipt listed my name and room number. But someone else had signed. Don't know if it was just dumb luck they chose my room to charge it to, if it was intentional, or if it was just a mistake. I remarked that they should really use some form of verification/identification for room charges since anyone could have done this or done it to anyone and the receptionist remarked that this seemed to be a recurring issue. I noted that although yes, my co-worker and I did have a few drinks there, and although we unfortunately had to pay in cash and lacked the receipt due to the crappy service, I could recall exactly what we ordered, where we sat, and describe our waitress. She assuaged me when she said they would remove the charges from the bill, handing me a new itemized statement that would be processed on my check out, and I thought that was the end of that....The following week I checked my credit card statement and saw the hotel had in fact charged me the $198 without sending me any sort of notification, which struck me as somewhat underhanded. I've now disputed the charge with my credit card and with the billing department at 'Big Marriott' - I'm hopeful this time the hotel will actually cancel the charges, instead investigating who (presumably a family?) did in fact place the order and perhaps more importantly enact some verification controls on room charges. Long story short: If you do stay here, be sure to check your statement.",,Scott C,1,3.0

It’s a big hotel with everything you’d expect. Enjoyed the music on the deck - on each night. It would be better if the hotel fee of US$37 a night (apparently to cover such benefits) were clearly disclosed up front in the nightly rate when booking; this is how it is done for hotels in Australia - the amount you see per night is what you pay (plus the government’s goods and services tax). I was disappointed that half the final account including the hotel fee was debited from the credit card a couple of days before leaving; I guess if you complained about the hotel fee when you leave the hotel would at least keep the half they have already helped themselves to.

International House of Pancakes? Cheeseburger in Paradise? This is the area for you! Every high end brand can be found in this area. If shopping is your thing, and you don't have access to these stores at home, you will love the Waikiki area. For us, we aren't shoppers and we don't go to chain restaurants at home, so we certainly weren't going to visit them in Hawaii! Needless to say, we were not happy with our location. The room was fine. Very large. A bit noisy. Supposedly ocean view, but only if we stood out on the balcony and put up with the traffic that was truly our view.

Upon checking in I was informed that the only room available was a room with two double beds for six nights. Despite indicating that I had requested a single bed room, the staff explained that the room was not available (I was checking in at 9pm) and that I would have to wait two nights for a new room.I explained that I was traveling for work and that I did not want to re-pack after two nights given my hectic business schedule.Two days later I received a frantic and condescending voice mail explaining that housekeeping still saw my belongings in the room and that they 'had tried to reach me ALL DAY"" (caps for emphasis on the voice mail.)This 7pm phone call, however, was the first I had heard from them. Given that I left the room at 6am for meetings, I was CERTAIN they would have left a voicemail. HOWEVER, there was absolutely NO voicemail or any indication that (as emphasized by the staff leaving the voicemail) they had been trying to contact me ALL DAY. Instead there was no indication whatsoever that the staff had tried at any point to contact me. When I called the front desk, they merely said that, to clarify, when housekeeping went into my room there was luggage. TO ME, luggage in the room does not indicate any effort to communicate with me until 7pm when I received the first effort to communicate via my cell phone to let me know that the room (mind you that I had booked!!!) was no longer available (mind you, that I said I didn't want, despite being disappointed and expecting more from the Marriott)OVERALL. AWFUL COMMUNICATION and SERVICE. fine facilities. disappointing pool space (the hot tub is slippery and uncomfortable) and overpriced resort fee is included for ""internet"" and an 8am fitness class.

Although I am a Marriott Gold member, I booked this stay on Trip Advisor as I received a lower rate. I booked a 'run-of-the-house-room', so I didn't have very high expectations. My check-in with Lani was a revelation of how good service can be routinely delivered. Attentive to me, responsive to my requests, but also versed in company policy. When she said yes or no to my requests, I could sense those were accurate answers. As I was early my room wasn't ready, so I used the pool for awhile. I was happy to receive an upgrade in the tower in closest to the beach. I was assigned room 1003 (which I HIGHLY recommend). It is an ocean view room. Because it is on a corner it had TWO balconies. One could sit on the front facing balcony in the mornings to get the view and the indirect sun and sit on the side balcony in the afternoon to enjoy the outdoors without sitting in the direct light of the sun. While I happened to be in the lobby, I stopped by to thank Lani for two things: first having spent more than 450 nights at Marriott Hotels, I have seen all kinds of service and I wanted to thank her for the kindest and most competent service I think I have ever had and secondly for the great room. As a kind gesture she and her manager sent a gift basket to my room with chocolate covered strawberries -- needless to say they had me right there. The room was clean and functional. The hotel is nice, it has been there a while and there are some signs of wear at the edges. Most importantly, the location is great. Busy area, but not over-crowded. Yes, the pool area service could stand some additional staffing, but I had a great experience and it all started at the front desk. I highly recommend that one give the Guest Service Agent the benefit of the doubt during check-in. Their attitude can make or break your stay and your attitude can determine theirs.

Of course there are several heated pools between Hotel and the beach, so you can always choose what you prefer better. There are also few Restorants between the pools, but this is standard for such a resort type. Our apartment was huge, two bedrooms connected with bathrooms, each approximately 40 m2, and big living room connected with kitchen also about 40 m2 of space. Very comfortable and nice, really “American standard”. The hotel is placed in one large resort aria together with few other Hotels ( one of them is fancy “Four seasons”) about 45 km from Honolulu. There is a highway all the way, so you can make it in about 40 minutes of driving with a car. Take care about terrible ‘Rush our’ on the highway between 7-10AM and 4-7PM.

Pros - close to Waikiki downtown- close to popular sites & hikes- has stores inside for quick merchandise pick-upCons- they didn’t tell you there is a resort fee until you get there ($30 more EACH day)- parking is $40 if you park yourself and $45 if you valet... not really a good price at all- Ocean-view room is extremely loud from all the traffic on the street- staff aren’t all that friendly at all except for valet. Personal experienceI called a month before we arrived to make sure chocolate covered strawberries and drinks were in the hotel before we got there (celebrating 2 year anniversary) and asked how much parking was a day - guy on the phone said “$10” so I thought sweet! I’ll rent a car.Got to the hotel, found out what “real” parking cost. The guy at the front desk who checked us in was super rude, and when I asked him if he could talk to the guy who set up our reservation he was very reluctant and tried to hurry us off by telling us the resort fee and throwing us our keys. Food for thought - tell your guests there is a fee, I probably wouldn’t have booked this hotel knowing that since we used zero of the amenities. Also, I wouldn’t have rented a car knowing the price of parking. Resort fee includes : free WiFi, pool, dvds, gym, and a few other unworthy things. There’s a beach across the street, I didn’t need WiFi because I’m on vacation and if I wanted it I would pay it myself, we are hardly in the hotel so I didn’t used the dvds and I’m not working out during vacation. All in all - Things they should tell you while you book. Got to my room, nothing I ordered was there. Had to call and asked them not to charge my card. We ordered room service (a salad and a burger) $70! Seventy frikkin dollars! Not only do they charge 20% grat, they also charge you a service fee on top of the tip. Then why am I tipping you if I’m already paying you to take the elevator? The food was subpar - not worth it. Won’t do that againAll in all, would I stay here again? No. I am paying an extra $70 a day on top of the $150 I paid per night to be here. Best bet is to Airbnb or pay $220 to stay at a nicer place. The location is nice, the hotel is big, but it’s really nothing spectacular. My biggest irritation is that they withhold information to get you to pay more when you arrive. What am I gonna say, “no, I’m not going to pay for parking or for your resort fee”? Never stayed at a Marriott before, probably won’t ever again.

We enjoyed the Kuhio Beach Grill in the mornings for breakfast, and we dined in the Sansei seafood restaurant one night and Arancino's (Italian) another evening. We also tried (and loved) Tiki's Grill and Bar across the street for dinner one evening, and had reservations as d.k. Steakhouse on property for our final evening but later decided to venture nearly a mile away from the hotel to try Stripsteak instead. Cheeseburger in Paradise is also just a block away for burgers or nachos and an enticing Happy Hour. So again... lots of dining options within minutes of your room. They also have a number of shops on site, but the shopping is much, much better half a mile down the beach. My biggest criticism of the Marriott is; there are too many areas on property that are lacking in decor -- nothing but cement walls and floors on lengthy walks on the second and third floors in particular. You can go from ""how pretty"" to nothing special in seconds. Also, be sure to note there is a daily resort fee per room. Regardless, it's a nice hotel in a good location with great restaurant selections both on premises and very close by.","Rockwall, Texas","LtColRiley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rockwall, Texas</strong>",194,4.0

Having a rental car and previous experience on Oahu, I did not buy any packaged tours. TripAdvisor says this hotel is rated number 4 on Oahu and I second that. It is an excellent and convenient place to stay (a block to the ocean and two blocks from Honolulu Zoo). For parking, I recommend the garage directly across Kuhio street which has an in-and-out rate of $80 for a 7-day week, much less than any hotel parking garage. I was very pleased with this Marriott. It is a quality place! There is a $36,65 (with tax) ""Daily activity fee"" which covers ukelele lessons, yoga or zumba lessons, and a whole bunch of other activities that we did not use at all. But, it was not a surprise because it was disclosed when I booked my trip with American Airlines.

Rates were a little lower, as this was an slower week. I got a room in K Tower (the front one) on the east side, facing the Aston. Here's my impressions:As soon as I walked into the room I got a whiff of the mildew. Not too strong, and after airing out the room over the next 5 days I never really noticed it again. It had 2 beds but they were not queens, just double-sized, so a bit shorter. The bed had 4 pillows that worked well; no issues there.The room safe in the closet is big, but it's down on the floor, so you'll have to get on your knees to use it. There was a iron and board in there also.The carpeting was very old and in need of replacement. The bathroom was good. Not huge but not small and tight. The shower came with a detachable shower-head with 2 positions, high or low, making one of the few that are high enough that I don't have to stoop over to rinse my hair when taking a shower. Great water pressure too.The light was a little dim.The flat TV was huge with a ton of input jacks. And it had SURF TV, so I could watch the Volcom Pro up at Pipeline live!The good thing about this room was the balcony. It had 2 chairs, a small table and a lounge, with room for 2 more chairs. And while it directly faced the Aston across the street, it also had a side view of the Waikiki Pier and the pool at Kuhio Beach. I could check out the surf every morning and get sun until about 1 or 2 pm.Unfortunately, it also gets a bit of noise from the street below. Many trolleys go up the one way street and ring their bells every time they stop there and there is noise from the band playing at the tiki bar at the Aston until about 11 pm.Wi-Fi was pretty good throughout the property. Which was good because that was the only thing in the Resort Fee that I needed. I never used the gym or any of the other offerings they charged me $38.74 a day for.Getting on to the rest of the hotel- the 2 pools are on the smaller side. I liked the one near K Tower better. The restaurants were good. I liked the sushi at Sansei. Very soft rice in the tuna rolls.I ate at DK Steakhouse twice and had the organic roasted chicken both times. They have a tasting menu for wines. I tried the Pinot Envy tasting for $12.I also tried the buffet at Kuhio Beach Grill. It was 1/2 price from 5- 6 pm. But with one glass of red wine still came to $37 with tip. They add the tip to the bill BTW. The prime rib was sub-par, not really ""prime"". I tried having breakfast there one morning but service was so slow I just left. Good thing, because not only did the grill want about $24 for breakfast, but I got to try Arancino di Mare, which is at street level. They had a decent breakfast with unlimited refills on juice. If you eat breakfast at the hotel you should try this place first.The hotel is not a real resort and should not have that in the name. No gardens or beachfront should rule it out. They did have more than a few shops, and the ABC stores (2, front and back) came in handy for a cheap snack or beverage. I rented a bodyboard at Aqua Zone for just $10 for 24 hours. There's another shop that rents better boards for a bit more. They had a perfume store that kept bugging me every time I walked by, asking me if I'd like to try a sample. They do that in the courtyard AND on the street! The Harley Davidson shop on the street has gone out of business.I liked how close the hotel was to the beach. I could walk to the corner and cross and be there. I bodyboarded at the pier, surfed out on the reef and snorkeled in the pool, where there are a ton of fish alongside the edges. Good snorkeling just down the beach at the longer pier.The K tower had 5 elevators, so there wasn't too much of a wait. You need to use your room keycard at night to go up.Parking was very expensive. I rented a car for one day and needed to go back to the front desk and get new room keycards so I could use them to get out of the parking garage, which is very tight. So I had to get new keycards. The front desk staff were very helpful. If you only need to park so a few hours, just use the zoo parking around the corner. It's only $1/ hour, while the hotel charges $40/ day.","Brentwood, California","Orion_240</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brentwood, California</strong>",76,3.0

So close to shopping and bus services.The only negative I have is the outrageous almost criminal cost of the breakfast buffet- roughly $73.00 US for the two of us so we ate as much as we could. Having never been to Honolulu before we weren't familiar with what restaurants were around us- we had arrived late the night before after a day of flying, plus we were up early because of a tour and needed to eat somewhere close and it was open early in the morning.

And the couple of pictures I have attached don't even begin to show just how badly the rooms were in disrepair. Here's a tip Marriott - when you can no longer repair things in rooms or clean them sufficiently then it is time to RENOVATE! This is a great location. Why would they let this hotel get in such a state? Especially at the prices they charge.We loved the location, the view and the staff we encountered was excellent.

He also told us that the room we were in had not been renovated yet, but we were happy to get even a partial ocean view!The room was a standard hotel room, but had all the normal amenities (safe, mini-fridge, coffee maker). The ice was on odd floors, so we had to take the elevator one floor down/up, but the elevators were a smooth, fast ride.The hotel has a lovely lobby, open-air, as most Hawaiian hotels do.

Inexpensive breakfast!)The hotel is across the road from Waikiki beach. It is nicely located close to amenities, the Honolulu Zoo (good size in the middle of a city!), 2 very nice, upscale malls, and several excellent restaurants.Within the hotel, we ate at Sensei (expensive, but good sushi, discount for hotel guests from 4:30-6:30), and Maona Terrace (open-air cafe with good food and KILLER views of Waikiki beach). The sunsets aren't to be missed!! And the Lava Flow drink is a treat!The staff...Pao, a maid, was in our room cleaning when we returned late morning one day. She was very nice, but asked us to prove we were in the room (very politely!), as security in a large hotel is a concern. We were happy to use our key and impressed that the staff were trained that well. When she left shortly after, she asked if we needed anything and wished us a pleasant stay. :) We found the room comfortable and clean.The bell desk has small bottles of cold water, and there is a purified water refill station across the lobby as well. A nice touch for tourists walking about the city.Beach towels are available in the gym and near one of the 2 pools. They were plentiful and clean, and we were welcome to take them to the beach.Finally, I inquired one day before we left about a late checkout, as we were flying out at about 8 p.m. the next day. Richard and Catrina were very helpful and let me know the options. I was happy to pay $20/hr for a few extra hours (to catnap and shower) before we headed to the airport. Nice option!I will recommend your hotel to friends and family.

The hotel is also not directly on the beach (it's across the street) so you will need to rent beach chairs and umbrellas from one of the stands set up on the beach.

After reading reviews on Trip Advisor I wasn’t sure what to expect. People always have such varying views and expectations and sometimes reality is in the middle. Well we arrived and it is an open air type hotel. It has shops inside and two pools - they’re pretty small as people commented. You have to get there early to get chairs. Cabanas are available to rent - they’re probably ok to rent but you could catch it in between. The food service is great. We ordered drinks and food - pizza, quesadillas-typical fare. The breakfast buffet in the Grille restaurant was fantastic! Always have great fruit, omelettes made to order and delicious baked pastries like sticky and cinnamon buns! The beach is just outside with a barrier to keep it safe for kids to swim. There are stores outside - Starbuck’s, ABC and outside cafes. The zoo is around the corner and the Waikiki Aquarium is a ten minute walk. We preferred to grab a Lyft though. We did souvenir shopping at the hotel. Got some great deals. The room is comfortable- queen beds and a pullout couch. The bathtub is clean - no rust as others cited. At least our room. The drain hardware could be newer but it’s ok. The door to the bathroom is a tight fit so it’s hard to move around in the bathroom with the toilet. Our room had a separate sink area so that was good for getting ready. The room has a refrigerator and large TV. Comfortable desk space to work. The best part were the balconies. We had two but one had a great view of the pools and ocean. While it’s not the ihilani at k’o O’lina where I stayed 9 years ago it still is very nice. Clean and comfortable especially for a family of 4! Proper planning and everyone can get ready. The staff was courteous and helpful. The bellman brought our bags to the room when we arrived right away. Very helpful staff! I’d return again! This is in the heart of the action.

We didn’t choose the hotel it was part of a cruise package. Check in isn’t until 3pm however there was a very helpful lady (Carolina?) who said she could upgrade us to a family room for an additional $90+ taxes. So after a long flight we got to check in at 10:30am. These family rooms are usually $500 a night so my expectations were expecting a luxury room. The lobby area is modern, clean and makes you think you are in a top resort in Waikiki. I’d expect the rooms to match, also looking at the photos on the website I thought I’d get something very similar to thatWell the room appears clean on the surface. But the couch in the room was so uncomfortable and worn out. It looked like it belonged in the side of the road. I would not expect furniture to be so worn if you are staying at a “luxury resort”. The beds looked comfortable but I was surprised when there were no quilt covers on the doona instead they had 2 sheets covering the doona. In saying that the doona was clean. I did find hair in one of the beds, thankfully I was able to use the other queen bed instead. The shower and bath were clean but again the money they charge for a family room I’d expect it to be modern. The bath had the enamel missing in places the soap holder looked old and cracked. Positive the bathroom supplies were nice. The biggest annoyance I found though was the NOISE. Oh my goodness coming off a long flight all we wanted to do was sleep but we could hear the people in the next room throughout the day and some electrical noise that sounded like a lift running all night. Then it gets worse...the music and noise from the surrounding hotels is just unbearable. The noise from the traffic I can ignore, as it is a busy tourist area but the partying and the constant noises from some electrical thing is just too much. I’m thankful we just wasted $90 and not the $500 that the room usually goes for. I’d suggest looking somewhere else if you want a peaceful nights sleep so you are regenerated for sightseeing and beach fun. There are so many to choose from I suggest you go on reviews and not the hotels website. I am yet to find a hotel room that looks anything like what’s advertised. But if the location of the Marriott Waikiki is what you’re after make sure you don’t stay in room 1812.","Melbourne, Australia","bonnie901</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",2,2.0

Our first impressions of the hotel were very favourable. We arrived at the hotel in the morning as we had just got off a long overnight flight from Australia. We expected to drop our bags off and wait for our room to be available in the afternoon but the lovely lady (unfortunately I have forgotten her name) at reception changed our room and we were able to check into our room straight away. The Marriott is a large hotel with 2 towers and a lobby in the middle. Our room was in the tower closest to the beach and was clean, large and comfortable with glimpses of the beach from our balcony. The bathroom was a little on the small side with the basin outside the bathroom which made it easier for one person to get ready for the day while the other person used the shower/toilet facilities. Unfortunately we had a room with a connecting door which allowed the noise from the next room to filter into ours. Luckily for us, our neighbour was considerate although we may have disturbed them early in the morning as we often had to get up early to make our bus tours. Although the Marriott was clean, tidy and had good customer service, we found the lifts to be quite slow with lots of people lined up to access them most of the day and into the night. The hotel is also quite expensive to eat at and although the restaurants onsite sounded delightful we did not eat there as the prices for meals were just too high. Even the continental breakfast you could get delivered to your room was $18 without tax or gratuity. This hotel is also situated at one end of Waikiki Beach nearest Diamond Head and across the road from the beach, although it was a bit of walk to restaurants and shops so be aware of this if booking this hotel.

We also stayed at the Marriott in Wailea & Līhue during our trip. The hotel was nice. I have status with Marriott and we were given and upgraded room. The rooms were nice. The bathrooms were a bit outdated, but nothing that made me think twice about it. The hotel lobby is beautiful and has some great shops in it. Where my complaint lies is with their total lack of any emergency plan, or really any organization or communication with their guests during an emergency. Unfortunately, we were all guests when the missile threat was sent out to all of Hawaii. My husband, as well as the couple we were traveling with both received the alert and agreed (in a panic) to meet in the lobby. The first issue was that the stairs are not clearly labeled at all. After running all over our floor, we found the stairs tucked away, and with minimal signage. We ran down 18 flights of stairs to meet them, and once we reached the lobby it was total chaos. The staff had absolutely no plan, and no idea what to do with everyone. We kept asking where we should shelter, if there was a basement, and they just told everyone to go back to their rooms. They also made no announcements over the intercom, so God forbid the warning was real, anyone who was still asleep (it was 8:08am) should have had no idea what was happening. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to wait out for a nuclear missile in my hotel room in the 18th floor. There was not even any mention of stay away from windows, or stay in your bathroom, or anything like that. It honestly just created more unnecessary panic and hysteria. I’ve heard accounts from many other people who were staying in hotels and they alerted their guests at once, got them into a parking garage or basement, and kept everyone there until it was determined the threat was false. All the Marriott did was take an already horrific and terrifying experience, and make it much much worse.","Charlotte, North Carolina","Jami S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charlotte, North Carolina</strong>",2,2.0

The Hotel is located at one end of Waikiki Beach. Whilst this might sound like a good location it is a little walk to get to any other locations past a lot of construction sites and other older run down hotels. The hotel is also very dated. The rooms and pool area looks like hotels you see in the movies from 1970s. The bathroom was tiny and very old. We did have a room on the 25th Floor which did give us great views of the beach and bay but every time you got in the elevator it was a bit hit and miss as to whether you would get to your desired floor. On a couple of occasions we ended up having to take the service elevator because the guest elevators had broken downAlso was disappointed by the fact that as a Elite Member, one of the benefits I am supposed to get is complimentary breakfast and cocktails for me a one guest. One I checked in I was told that I would get a complimentary breakfast and I would get 25% discount on her breakfast. I questioned this and was told this was the hotel policy. The manager made some excuses about this policy be contrary to other other policies in Marriott group because of the cost of living in Hawaii. I have lived for the last 20 years in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo the most expensive cities in the World and not once have they tried to fob me off with that excuse. I have stayed in Marriott group hotels in all those cities and the complimentary breakfast for me and my guest has been extended on all occasions, with out question. Also in all these cities I have been invited for complimentary cocktails. I did eventually get a voucher for complimentary breakfast but felt as somebody who has been an Elite member for over 10 years and having invested a tidy sum in Marriott Vacation Club ownership that this recognition should not have to be fought for. Having said this I wish I hadn't bothered. We only tried to eat breakfast twice. Both mornings we came down to find massive queues and no sense of any organisation being shown by the staff at all. For example in front of us there was a group of eight people who wanted to be sat together so we had to wait for them to be seated before they would seat us even though there were several empty tables for couples.

I had also stayed at the nearby Coconut Waikiki at 175$/night and found the latter better in service and hospitality. One could easily sense that the Marriott was more interested in extracting cash from its customers than providing decent customer service or treating its employees well. Employees appeared generally demotivated. Some specific examples of my issues here:- Room was fairly standard and dated for a luxury hotel and bathroom was no better than an average Holiday Inn. Walls were thin so one could hear conversations clearly from the room next door.-The hotel has two 30 story buildings for residents but a common infrastructure that is woefully inadequate. Queues for the 40$ breakfast were 30-45 minutes, swimming pool was tiny and overcrowded and there was 1 jacuzzi for the whole hotel.- a can of diet coke would cost 11$ for room delivery and we were told it could take 1/2 hour- our luggage was delivered in 1 hour.- Reception kept me on hold for 10 minutes to answer a simple question, luckily their phones have a speaker.- Lani at reception should be trained better as she appeared to be more of a pompous official than a friendly receptionist, I would have thought that was a minimum requirement in a 500$ plus hotel in Hawaii of all places. Compare that to the friendly receptionists at the Coconut Waikiki- Cost 9.75$ for me to print my boarding pass at the Business centre, at the Coconut they did it for you for free. The location was great but with so many irritations at an expensive hotel, I would look elsewhere.

A convenient place to stay - centrally located for most events. This was a big week for tourists and the Hotel was overbooked and wall to wall with people. Arrived late at night from SF. Slow checkin process and some confusion about the room reservation. 16th floor in the Pao Tower with a balcony and two standard beds - workable but very small from our normal queen. Great room staff and service - we were outdoors all the time so we were constantly getting wet from either the ocean or the swimming pool and the room staff kept our room spotless and stocked with fresh towels. I found the food everywhere to be pretty average and we ate in a lot of places including the hotel. Book your Hotel reservations early - a lot of Hotel guests like the comfort of eating in the Hotel. The Sansei and dk steakhouse were totally booked whenever we tried for a reservation - generally a one hour wait if you didn't have a reservation. We got take out from Sansei one night and that was a good idea and a good meal. Plenty of shops and local restaurants in the immediate area. A walk to the beach, and an easy walk just about anywhere else. The 5 year old had about a 1/2 mile walk limit so we took a cab anywhere outside of that. Cab stand at the Hotel and also a Baggage Storage area - helpful when your flight out was at 11pm at night. A concierge and info desk - but those were generally swamped. Two main pools and a hot tub - saline pools and a moderate temperature.

I booked a trip to Hawaii as an end of the year vacation before returning to work. As Gold Elite Member I was committed to Marriott properties, however after this last trip, I am not sure. Before booking my hotel, I called the hotel and explained that my foot was in a cast and would be unable to go down to the beach, walk around or walk on the sand. I wanted to ensure that the room I was getting would have full unobstructed view of the water, specifically from my balcony as that is the only think I would want to do is sit on the balcony and look at the water. I paid almost $2000 for 2 nights in this hotel to ensure that my foot would not ruin my experience. Upon checking in, I get to my room and there are two balconies, (1) that faces the mountains/City and another that has a slight view of the water, if you look through the buildings to the left. The bathroom was not as clean as it should be, there was no phone by the bed, so every time I had to make a call I had to hobble out of bed all the way to the other side of the room. the bed was actually blocking the entrance and not only could I barely get my luggage in, when I ordered room service the attendant literally had to move my entire bed to even get into the room. I called the front desk and explained my dissatisfaction. They told me they could not do anything, but could change my room the next day……I went to change rooms the next day – still no balcony facing the water, but I did have a very dirty window that had a very clear view of the ocean. There were several hair strands on the bed and in the bathroom (gross) there was rust and stains all through the bathroom, dirt on the curtains, spider/cobb webs on the window seals. Also lets talk about the toilet. Honestly it was the loudest toilet flushing to the point that in the middle of the night when my sister went to use the bathroom it actually woke me up. It also would gurgle throughout the night, we thought it was going to overflow. If this review allows me to upload a video, I am going to include it so you can hear it. Also none of the balconies have screens so If I wanted to open the door and get a breeze I had to deal with bugs as well. The only good things that I can say is Rob- The security guy was amazing, when we first checked in they gave us keys that didn’t work, he immediately brought new keys up to our room, and after dinner wheeled me back up to my room so I would not have to hobble. Eli at the front desk was great as well. Also I do have to say that the room service (breakfast) was amazing. If I would have spent $200 a night I think this would be unacceptable but to spend almost $1000 (1k) per night is unbelievable, The biggest waste of money I have every spent. Either way I am quite upset that I spent $2000 for two nights of no full views from the balcony, dirty room, rusted floors, spiderwebs, dirty curtains, and someone else’s hair in my bed and bathroom.. If this is the quality of hotels that are acceptable to the Marriott, then Needless to say I am pretty much done with Marriott.",,ShyA5,3,1.0

Close contenders are the Sedona Marriott and the Residence Inn San Diego Downtown/Bayfront Marriott. I base this on many factors including location, physical facilities, staff friendliness/helpfulness, and amenities. The Waikiki resort started me off a skeptical. Unfortunately, the first staff member we dealt with checking in was not very friendly (check in staff at Waikoloa Hilton on the Big Island was super nice and helpful.) It just seemed like she didn’t want to be there. Everyone has bad days, I will strike it up to that. After that first contact almost every staff member we came in contact was super friendly and helpful. The breakfast wait staff ladies were lovely always checking if you needed anything and bringing juice for the kids and coffee when needed. The morning hostess there seemed very serious and not very personable either (besides the lady at check in, this was the only other employee that stood out as not being very pleasant.) Luckily the wait staff made up for the hostess. The concierge staff was excellent. We talked to the concierge people on several occasions. They were always friendly and helpful. They offered great advice on activities and made bookings easy. Their recommendations were spot on! The rooms were very nice and pleasant. The workout room was fantastic! Surly the biggest gym in a hotel I have ever stayed at. They have floorspace areas for cardio/body weight workouts, free weights, machine weights, and of course countless cardio machines. The second or third floor (can’t remember exactly) has the workout room and a huge open area patio. And I mean huge, the workout room is at one end and the patio café/bar is at the other. The patio has two swimming pools and a hot tub between those areas. There was plenty of lounging chairs for people to relax and sunbathe in on the patio. Our kids loved the pool and the adults loved the hot tub. I even got in the pool after my kids told me it was really warm. Now I have fallen for that in the past and of course was shocked by the cold water. Not so here, I got from the hot tub into the pool and was immediately surprised by how pleasant it was. The patio café/bar was an excellent place to hang out in the evenings drinking a Mai Tai and enjoying the warm air and coastal scenery. The downstairs lobby area was spacious and very nice. The Marriott basically takes up a city block. On the ground floor in addition to the Marriott they had ABC stores and Starbucks Cafes (two of each on either side of the building if I am remembering correctly. There was also some small gift shops and an Enterprise car rental kiosk there. Right across the street was a Wolfgang Puck Express where grabbed some quick tasty meals on a few occasions. There are several restaurants within walking distance and you are directly across the street from the beach. The buffet breakfast was included in our Costco vacation package and it was spectacular. They had eggs to order and lots of other food choices.Probably the only negative side to this location (and it wouldn’t matter what hotel you stayed in) was the noisy city. Early mornings the garbage trucks were out banging around emptying dumpsters. And you have people yelling and screaming out in the street on occasion. But it is the same in most major cities.

Had we been staying for several nights it would have been an issue. Proximity to the beach, Waikiki shell, and shopping was great. Both rooms appeared to be very clean and in good working order.

I have had the experience of staying at several Marriott Resort properties in my 800+ Marriott nights over the years. I believe I've finally cured myself of the desire to stay at them. Between the resort fees which offer little value in exchange for the cost, the properties tend to be well used, which is a euphemism. The large property is located directly across the street from a pleasant beach with a sea wall offering young and old the opportunity to enjoy the water without the full effect of waves. In terms of location, it's situated at the terminus of Kalakaua Avenue, which is essentially the main center of attraction in Waikiki. It's a short walk to the zoo and to all of the upscale shoppes and boutiques.In terms of accommodation, the hotel leaves much to be desired. It's immediately obvious that rooms were last updated in the 1990s or early 2000s. The rooms are clean and comfortable, of course, but they offer little in style that one would expect from a Marriott property. It's clearly a property that is past its prime. I moved to this location after a few nights at another Marriott property nearby and wish I would've stayed where I was. The hotel is easily avoidable on future visits and so I shall do so.My biggest disappointment with the stay was that I had to do battle with the staff regarding my Lifetime Platinum upgrade. Note to management: it's not an upgrade to offer the same room with a different view, no matter how it's spun. After flexing muscles with reservations, I was able to secure a very modest upgrade to a larger room. What's most disappointing is that I checked hotel availability daily and there were suites available each day, yet I was told by staff each day that I asked that none was to be had. I've encountered this duplicity at other properties over the years. I suspect it's the misguided policy of local management, as Customer Services, which soon will be getting my complaint, has always been rather gracious to compensate me when I've received this treatment.","Weil am Rhein, Germany","travelentuziast</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Weil am Rhein, Germany</strong>",128,3.0

There are no water bottles in the rooms, coffee service but no cups, and to order room service for a pot of coffee takes more than 45 minutes.

That was how it was for me recently, and this Marriott was the logical location for the stay. So sarcasm aside, Hawaii is a lovely place to visit no matter the reason for the trip, and that's true even in exceptionally touristy Waikiki. This Marriott is across the street from Waikiki Beach, and a short walk from all the shopping and what-not you'd ever want (including an Apple Store, which was handy since my iPhone died while I was there). This hotel has not one, but two ABC Stores on the main floor in case you have a need for an Aloha shirt, bottle of wine, Spam Musubi, or a taste of ice cream. (If you've been to Waikiki, you'll understand the joke there.) The property itself is nice, especially considering that it was built in 1968, and last renovated in 2008. The rooms do seem to show nearly a decade of wear, but have been well maintained. About my only complaint was the fact that one of the two sliding glass doors in my room was rough and hard to open. But given the exquisite views of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach from my high floor, corner room in the Paoakalani Tower? It was easy to overlook. Comfy beds and a reasonably quiet environment rounded-out a good experience. Wouldn't hesitate to return there in the future. One more tip: While the food and drink are expensive, just indulge, understand you're at a resort in Hawaii, and enjoy.

With that said, the cruise line knew when we were arriving, had someone at the airport to pick us up (they met us in the luggage claim area) and they presented us with leis. All very nice, but I suspect the Marriott had nothing to do with the pick up service.We arrived at about 11 AM on a Wednesday morning and were surprised when our spacious room on the 16th floor of one of the towers was ready. The beds were comfortable and the room was spotless. We had a private balcony overlooking the St Augustine Church and a view of Waikiki Beach (see photo).We decided to eat in restaurants outside the hotel as the hotel restaurants menus were a bit high priced. On our trip from the airport to the hotel, the driver gave us some tips of places to eat which and we used tripadvisor to search for others. We did save some money by doing this and found some decent food as well.We did have drinks and lunch on the afternoon of our arrival at the beach side bar.which cost us over $70 including tip (reviewed in restaurants).On Friday evening, the last night of our stay, we decided to do some laundry because we still had another 9 days of trip in front of us. Fortunately, the hotel does have a laundry which isn't cheap ($4/load for the washer, $4/load for the dryer and another couple of bucks for the soap and fabric softener). While doing that, my wife read a book and I dropped by the bar by the beach, grabbed a couple of drinks and brought them back to the laundry which was a short walk from the bar! HOW CONVENIENT!We did some shopping in the hotel shops for gifts for our two toddler grandkids.The rooms were made up every day. We were out on Cruise line arranged excursions on Thursday, Friday and Saturday and the last excursion dropped us off at the Cruise ship. We choose to go out in the morning for breakfast and at night for dinner rather than eat in the hotel restaurants.Because this was part of the cruise package, we checked out by leaving our luggage and the keys in the room. The cruise line picked them up on Saturday and delivered them to our room on the ship (which wasn't quite a spacious).We walked by the pool (at the bar by the beach) and it looked very nice and it appeared the bar delivered drinks to your chair by the pool.Not a bad stay but not sure how much it added to the price of our cruise since it was all combined. I would consider this a luxury hotel.","Wilmington, Massachusetts","Robert M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wilmington, Massachusetts</strong>",202,4.0

Personally I would be able to rent a car for a few days, then you can get around on foot, bus, shuttle, taxi if you really wanted to go somewhere.

As you check in you can get a lovely purple Plumeria to tuck behind your ear and they give you a little box of chocolate covered macadamia nuts. The property offers classes and entertainment (hula lessons, yoga classes, lei making classes, etc) which are nice if you can take advange of these! We didn't because we were busy on excursions or in the pool.On the bottom floor of the hotel there are shops, an ABC market, scuba/snorkel gear rental place and you can charge the ABC market items to your room which is nice (add a way of getting more points!). The hotel has a few restaurants, but we only ate at the one near the pool and it was overpriced and not that great. It's super convenient to just order food and drinks while the kids are swimming but I would only take advantage if there's a happy hour. It's not all that great. The hotel is steps away from a ton of restaurants and bars and would definitely go exploring. The people at the concierge were very helpful and helped us book several excursions and I was able to charge the excursions to the room (helping me out get more Marriott points). They gave us some great recommendations and we were not disappointed with any of them!The rooms are a little dated, but they're spacious enough. We were upgraded to a nice suite this time around and it was so nice to have the extra room and the beautiful ocean view! Parking is pretty pricey, but that's the area. I would recommend a car if you want to go exploring. There are so many better beaches than Waikiki Beach that are relatively close (by car of course). If you're a Marriott Elite member (Gold or Platinum) the breakfast buffett is FREE (for 2 adults)! This was an amazing perk as the buffet is delicious!

This was our first visit to Oahu and Honolulu. Honolulu was just not our cup of tea. We come from South Florida and Honolulu seemed no different from Miami with the high rises, concrete, steel, asphalt, traffic congestion, and car horns. However we cannot hold this location against the Marriott. The Marriott Waikiki was a nice hotel with tasteful décor and upscale shops although it did have significant shortcomings. First of all there was the parking. You can choose how you want to be raped. You can self park at $40 a night or pay $45 for valet parking per night. This charge is just totally outrageous. In addition the hotel does not have any complimentary lobby coffee in the morning like most hotels do. The hotel has three restaurants with two of them very nice and upscale but the third restaurant named the Kuhio Beach Grille belongs in association with a Red Roof or Motel 6. We made the mistake of having dinner at this restaurant which was buffet in style and cafeteria in ambiance. The food was cafeteria quality as well and the buffet was also way overpriced Kuhio also serve a breakfast buffet and we went there one morning but found the food to only be mediocre and then again also overpriced. After this experience we had our breakfasts at the Starbucks off the lobby for much less money. We did enjoy dinner one evening at the DK Steakhouse however. This restaurant was indeed the quality that you would expect at the Marriott. I would also have to give high marks for the services provided at the front desk and concierge desks at this hotel.

Everything started off great. We were met at check in by Lani, who thanked me for being a Platinum member and proceeded with check in. She did an excellent job of explaining the benefits of being a platinum member and going over each thing individually. The only thing I really didn't care for was that breakfast was only included for the elite guest. This was obviously taken care of, but something to note. I inquired about the possibility of a suite upgrade if one was available. Little did I know that Lani had upgraded us to one of the best rooms, the Paupani (sp?) Suite. This was an excellent room on the 33rd floor. This suite had everything you could need. It had a sitting area, dining area, living room and separate bedroom, along with a master bath and another bathroom. Not to mention the two balconies to view Waikiki from. Things were sort of hit and miss from this point on. The breakfast at the grill only allowed for coffee or tea. If you wanted to espresso, it would cost you $8. Why would I pay $8 for a single espresso when there is a Starbucks in the hotel that would sell me a double for $3? We never really got any hot food unless you went to the omelet station or were lucky enough to catch food as it was being brought out. Otherwise, you were stuck with cold food from the buffet. It was free and the omelets were great, so that was a plus.The Moana Terrace bar and grill service was hit and miss as well. We'd have great service one day, only to be followed by below average the next. The pool service was the same way. I think it had to do with how busy the bar and grill was, but you're best just heading up to the bar and getting them yourself most of the time. We did have amazing service and meal from the dk Steakhouse one evening we were there. Our waiter helped us pick an amazing bottle of wine and our steak and lamb were cooked to perfection. It was a bit pricey, but worth it.The gym at the hotel was well equipped with plenty of exercise equipment. My wife and I were able to get great workouts in while we were there. Overall, 4 stars is a fair assessment. Based on the room alone would be 5 stars, but the service was lacking in certain areas and the breakfast didn't allow for a 5 star rating. Would we return? Yea, but only if we got to stay in the suite again. From what I saw with some of the other rooms, they didn't look like anything too special.","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","ScottSchultz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</strong>",45,4.0

The front desk was nickel and diming us over the comps for breakfast buffet and evening cocktail coupons. After my friends husband who is the black diamond called and spoke with them. they then gave us the breakfast buffets but only a drink coupons for one person. The breakfast buffet was phenomenal. Chuck- the omelette guy- was very friendly and personable and had a great suggestion as to how to spend our day John at the valet desk was also very friendly and informative and gave us a jogging map which I didn't even know existed. The DVD card worked about 50% a time and we kept having to trade it in because we either got movies that was not what we asked for or it never gave us the movies.

The hotel upgraded us, at no extra cost (and for seemingly no reason), to an accessible room with a king bed, two queen size beds and two bathrooms. This meant that we each had our own bathroom and one extra bed (that we used for our luggage). They even gave us a bottle of champagne on arrival! We ordered room service three times and each time it was delivered to our room with a rolling table that they set up in the middle of the room for us to eat at. The room was absolutely massive, with a view of the city and the hills. The beds were soft and comfortable, the room very neat, tidy and clean, and the bathrooms were clean as well and fully stocked.

We stayed in what I believe was a junior Suite and while it was adequate as far as the space and double balcony (!!!) was concerned, the amount of negative and empty space in the room agitated me personally. I just didn't understand the design. The most irking thing about this resort however is the missing beach amenities. How can you claim to be a beach resort hotel but don't provide your obviously from-out-of-town guests umbrellas, beach chairs, or even beach towels at the very least? Having to take pool towels in order to have a beach visit just puts the hotel at risk for losing hundreds of pool towels unnecessarily. I didn't understand this logic at all. Are guests supposed to buy these things while on vacation since they're not available to rent? Of the restaurants we went to in the hotel, the sushi one was best. The staff was very accommodating. The outdoor pool area that included food service was alright but the food lacked flavor and he service was poor.

The 2 pools were nice (could be larger), excellent fitness room, yoga in the morning, and the hotel is located directly across from a nice protected beach which is excellent for swimming.

I stayed 4 nights in a 'mountain view' room and was treated to pretty special sunrises and sunsets over Diamond Head and the beach. My room had a great view, plenty of space and good water pressure. This Marriott is staffed by a gigantic group of overachievers. Everyone on the payroll including the staff in the Starbucks and convenience stores works as hard as they can to insure you enjoy your trip to Hawaii. The hotel itself is massive and considers itself a resort. 'Resort' really means Marriott can over charge for even small items and it takes twice as long as usual to check. Listening to the opening and closing speech about resort fees and charges for parking can ruin the first and last day of your trip so be prepared. I used this location as a jumping off place for Honolulu and Diamond Head but because of the traffic it really wasn't practical for reaching the North Shore.","Jacksonville, Florida","Paul C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jacksonville, Florida</strong>",78,4.0

The hotel overall is in good condition. There is a self serve laundry which is also convenient. When we were there the coin change machine was out of order so we had to use a credit card. There is self serve and valet parking although we opted to park elsewhere. The resort fees are a bit steep ($35 + tax) and disproportionate to the ""extras"" that are included, many of which other hotels included for free (such as Wifi). There is one drink (Mai Tai or beer) per day included, per room, even though we had two people in the room. I would have expected two drinks per day, for the price. A resort fee is common in many of the hotels in the area although many charge less than the Marriott. Overall no issues during our stay.

The room seemed a little dated and the bathroom was small and so was the closet, but the room was very spacious. The view was beautiful as we had both an ocean and city view. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning was excellent and probably the only retreat from the heat as most businesses and restaurants around the beach were open to allow the hot air to flow. This hotel is not in the center of all the chaos of the tourists, but on the outskirts and still very busy, close to the zoo and a little walk past the park to the aquarium. I'd recommend this hotel to families, but it seemed to lack romance for a couples vacation. The breakfast buffet at the Kuhio Beach Grill is $35 per person and not really worth it, but everything on the menu is also expensive. I opted for a breakfast sandwich from Starbucks after being a little disappointed with the buffet. The Moana Terrace Bar and Grill was comfortable and the place we liked to hang out. The nachos were really good but mixed drinks were weak. There are plenty of other places nearby to eat and have drinks and close to a lot of shopping.

We are long time Marriott loyalists and used our accumulated points to stay here. The city is built right up to the beach, so you have to understand that. The drive in from the airport is mostly highway, but once you get off, it is confusing city streets. You have to pay to park $$$, so consider using Uber if you plan to just stay at this huge hotel. We planned to visit the Pearl Harbor Memorials, so we paid for valet parking, $45 per day. Self park is $40, so it was an easy choice. We pulled up and the very efficient valet called for a bellhop to help with our bags and pointed to where the front desk was. We have elite status and were seen with very little wait. We had booked an ocean view room and were not disappointed ( see pic). There are 4 restaurants and a pool bar/ grill. We ate every meal at the hotel except for lunch the day we visited Pearl Harbor. We had our first meal, a late lunch at the pool bar overlooking the beach. Fast service, yummy frozen drinks and a delicious flatbread pizza. The drinks are pricey at $12 for mixed and $9 for wine. We had two dinners at the Sushi restaurant which was excellent! We used room service for breakfast on our day out because you have to get to the Pearl Harbor Memorial early if you didn't think ahead to reserve tickets on line ( you should!). My wife is vegan so we wrote specific requests on the hang tag you leave on your door the night before. A very nice young lady called for clarification and filled our every request. The meal arrived promptly at 6:30am and was perfect.Our second morning we ate at the Grill Restaurant which is a different buffet every night of the week, but the same breakfast buffet everyday. They had everything you could possibly want, including custom omelets. The fresh fruit was plentiful and delicious. The waitress takes your drink orders at the table and even had soy milk for my wife. Waikiki Beach is but a sliver of what it once was. I don't know what they plan to do as the seas continue to rise? There is enough beach left in front of the Marriott for now. We did not visit the beach but did appreciate the beautiful scenery and enjoyed watching the surfing and sunsets.I don't think I would book here for a family beach vacation.

There are several shops spread across the grounds to include an ABC store. Several restaurant choices, all of which seemed to have good menus and prices compatible with the restaurants in Waikiki. We ate at Sansei and the sushi was fresh and tasty (Tip: go Sunday or Monday for the half price menu, but make sure to get in line by about 5 PM). The gym is bigger than your average mainland gym that only has two or three pieces of equipment at dumbbells. The gym had ample free weights, a Smith machine, plenty of equipment, etc. We did not go to the pool, but it looked average and seems quite crowded each time I walked by… Just go to the beach right across the street. Great location - walking distance to pretty much everything and central Waikiki and right across the street from the beach. I will say that stretch of beach gets quite crowded, so if you don't mind the walk I suggest going down towards Fort DeRussy (seemingly less crowds,calmer water, wider beach front, and sea turtles I seem to be hanging around that area). We stayed in the Paoakalani Tower (back of the property). I had a view of the beach and the city from the eighth floor and cannot complain. The room was clean, quiet, large, and seemed to be appointed with newer furniture and electronics.Only a few complaints… I know parking is at a premium in Waikiki, but the garage parking fee is pretty outrageous at $40 per day plus fees/taxes (valet is $45 a day). The staff as a whole were better and friendlier than average (especially the housekeeping staff ) except for the pool bar bartenders. Maybe it's the continuous stream of people that put them in a bad mood, I don't know, but they were not the friendliest group.My last complaint is admittedly a bit picky, but I wish this hotel was on the other side of Waikiki, closer to Hard Rock Cafe or Embassy Suites.Bottom line – I recommend this hotel and Lloyd definitely stay here again.","Denver, Colorado","ripcordzz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",78,4.0

The owners remodeled the lobby, removing the beautiful water garden and replacing it with a bland, non-appealing collection of conventional furniture.

In two separate rooms, one changed for the other, the finish of the bathroom fixtures was peeling and chipping away, and there was mildew everywhere in the grout and caulking. The rooms desperately need updating. There are numerous shops on the property, all but the ABC stores overpriced. The only factors keeping my rating from dropping lower are the excellent, friendly and helpful staff, and the outstanding - if pricey - restaurants which I rated separately and individually.

Upon arrival, we quickly found the open-air lobby on Ohua Avenue. Check-in was fast and easy thanks to the very nice and efficient front desk attendant. He got us all checked in and on our way up to our room very quickly. As Elite members, we received complimentary wifi, buffet coupons, coupons for free Mai Tais, a card for free DVDs and a few other little welcome perks. Our cozy room was clean, well maintained and had beautiful views of Waikiki Beach and downtown Waikiki. We booked a standard room but received an ocean view, so the view was much better than expected. My wife and I were traveling with our two daughters and found the two double beds to be comfortable and sufficiently sized for the four of us. The room also contained a 55-inch flat screen television, a writing desk and chair, mini-fridge and a closet safe. The resort has two towers. The Paokalani Tower sits further back away from the beach on the mountain side of the resort. The Kealohilani Tower sits closer to the beach on the ocean side. We stayed in the Paokalani Tower and had a fabulous view of the beach, city and distant mountains. Great views are available in both towers. Each tower also has a pool and deck. The pool outside the Kealohilani Tower is surrounded by a bar, towel desk, nearby restaurants and other amenities. It’s nice if you prefer a more social and busy environment. If you prefer a quieter environment with less foot traffic, the pool outside the Paokalani Tower is more laid back but still easily accessible to all the amenities. The towel desk requires a guest signature to take out towels but thankfully, no annoying towel cards. The hotel does not sit directly on the Waikiki beachfront, so you must cross Kalakaua Avenue to reach the beach. The short walk to the beach was no big deal for us at all and waiting for the traffic light was literally the most time-consuming part of the trip. There are two ABC shops, a Starbucks and various other stores, boutiques and restaurants on resort property. There is also a business center where guests can print boarding passes. It requires a room key for entry and also offers internet kiosk services for an additional charge. We didn't find ourselves in need of anything and were able to leave the car safely parked in the garage for our entire brief stay in Waikiki. We were very satisfied with our visit and had a very enjoyable time. The only con with our room really worth mentioning was the tiny sized bathroom. Not only was it too small but instead of a door, it had a sliding partition that we found impossible to lock. That’s pretty much it for complaints. It’s not worth complaining about parking and resort fees because it's not exactly unique to Marriott and I've learned to live with it as long as no surprises appear on the folio that I didn't agree to when I booked. Thankfully, no weird charges showed up at checkout. Fees and tiny bathroom aside, we really enjoyed our stay and plan to return soon.","Blue Bell, Pennsylvania","JHSR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Blue Bell, Pennsylvania</strong>",71,4.0

The hotel may be a bit old but the service is outstanding in all departments including front desk, restaurant, and housekeeping and that is largely the difference between other hotels in the area and the Marriott. Of course being situated in the heart of Waikiki and right on the beach are added benefits.A well run hotel, at its heart, has always the people who dedicate themselves to this superior service. Our gratitude goes to several of the finest staff members who have again and again touched our heart (including my wife’s who frequently accompany me on the trips) in a way that they have always gone out of their way to make us feel extremely special and made us feel that we were indeed in a paradise.Ms. Lorelie Rodrigues, the front desk manager, is always kind to accommodate our requests for room of our choice and to make sure that we are at home. But that is not the only reason why she brings value to Marriott operations. Ever since we have met her and seen her in action, we have seen remarkable changes in the attitude at the front desk. The front desk under her management has become friendlier, they have been very welcoming, they are always pleasant, and smiling and ready and willing to help. This is a very noticeable transformation in the front desk attitude from old “I just work here” attitude. This profound change reflects what Ms. Rodrigues has always shown us to be…..customer friendly, warm, and caring and going miles to please the customer. It is remarkable to see how one person’s pleasantness can be so contagious!!The top performer in the restaurant is Ms. Kim Mamiya. She is the hostess at the restaurant managing morning crowd for seating and followed by managing the servers to take care of the seated guests. Despite pressure and managing the most difficult logistics, Ms. Mamiya is always smiling and always very pleasant. I have seen her in this assignment for many many years and her attitude towards the guests has only gotten better. She is never flustered or aggravated. She is always calm, pleasant, and warm but above all extremely efficient. She is very approachable for special needs and she is extremely accommodating to your preferences in terms of seating and service.And if you were lucky enough to stay on 15th floor of beach side wing, you would experience the service from one of the best housekeeper, Marilou. Marilou adds to the hotel the brilliance and efficiency that are always first things to be noticed if they were missing. Marilou has a very pleasant personality and adding to that she has finest work ethics that you rarely see in this position. Once she is done with your room, it is meticulously finished with all your request in terms of extra towels, fresh sheets, special tea selection, etc complied with and leaving the room spotless, well groomed, and neat. On my last trip I stayed 10 days and she was off duty for about 3 days. Marilou was sorely missed during her absence because the differences in finish were very noticeable. Thank you Marilou for your superb service.We humbly request the management to pass on our gratitude to the very special people mentioned in this review.","Darien, Illinois","amir r</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Darien, Illinois</strong>",17,5.0

This time we only wanted a 3 island tour and after looking in the their tour book at what it included (sight seeing,meals etc. that were included we booked the trip.We planned to stay 2 weeks...1week with the Trafalgar Tour and the second week on the island of Maui which was the third island of the tour. So we booked the same hotel (and room) for our 2nd weeks stay. Jump ahead to 2017......time to head of to Hawaii .....and we get our itinerary........ and see the changes that have been made. Flight changes(not really big deal) hotel changes,/sight seeing changes that were disappointing to us. We called TRAFALGAR and were told that because we booked from 2016 book that things were now changed in the 2017 tour book.

If you want a simple breakfast, there is a Starbucks in the back of the lobby and also every fifty feet in any direction outside of the hotel. We did have a concern with the ""concierge"" service. We rely on the concierge at a Marriott to help us with planning local activities. The concierge at this hotel is a service run by Expedia. The job of the concierge is not to give you helpful advice, but to sell you on the most expensive possible tours. I assume the concierge is on commission. We did buy two tours (snorkeling and a luau) and they were very nice. Just don't ask about visiting the Bishop Museum in Honolulu since there is no profit for the concierge or Expedia in that. You will get an abrupt answer. The hotel should post signs saying concierge services provided by Expedia and not by Marriott. There is an Enterprise car rental office in the hotel open from 7 am to 3 pm. If you want to rent a car from Enterprise, see them, not the concierge.","Needham, Massachusetts","Rick02492</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Needham, Massachusetts</strong>",23,4.0

You may expect the hotel to be on the beach with a private beach area ... but no it is just near a public beach as there is a road in between and depending on your room you could be 100s of meters from it. Secondly why is it calling itself a resort and charging people $35+ tax per night ? There is nothing resort like... If the management think it's because it has some shops in the hotel selling over priced shirts ( which anyone could buy outside on the road) and various desks selling tours etc ( pretending to be concierge) they really are living in the clouds. The hotel is rather old with very low ceilings. I was upgraded to a larger room but the bathroom was tiny. I dread to think what the standard rooms are like. Breakfast is fine but nothing special for the price. The hotel seems to be stuck in 70s/80s, competition and standards have moved up and they are well behind.

We did an outrigger canoe surf ride, which was really fun but short. There are tons of hotels and shops in the immediate area.

The Management could not be any more professional, considerate, generous, and accommodating. A special thank you to those that I have had the pleasure to work with ;) You know who you are :) For the locals, business professionals, and for those that are coming for vacation, you would be making a great choice to stay at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa. You will have a great view, have convenience down in the ABC store and shops below, be perfectly located in Waikiki, enjoy the quiet and nice pool, get relaxed in the Spa, and have one of the best beaches in the world across the street.

We enjoy Marriott and feel that the reward points are worth it. We had earned three nights and use them in Hawaii at this hotel. This hotel is very centrally located and has all the amenities you need to travel around the city. Renting a car and parking fees are extremely expensive. We liked that we could rent a car straight from the hotel, enterprise and turned it in the same day saving parking fees at the hotel. You can rent multiple days however rent it one day at a time to save on the parking fees. I called the concierge at this hotel several times and she helped me plan our vacation. She was extremely helpful. I am a big Internet researcher however I really feel like the tip she gave me saved us a lot of time and money. The hotel is large and directly across from the beach. It has an ABC store right before you hit the beach. If you don't know what an ABC store is it's like a convenience store Walmart. It has everything.

The other side of the hotel fronts onto Kuhio Street, where there is a bus stop for several bus lines. Number 2 will take you to Diamond Head (a great hike - do it in the morning, when the heat is more tolerable), or in the opposite direction to number of points of interest for $2.50/pp. Ask for a transfer and if you can be back on the bus in two hours, that is all you pay for both directions. The hotel itself has a couple of nice restaurants - steak house and sushi and another restaurant for breakfast. Yes, there is Starbucks there too. The buffet is quite good. The Enterprise Rent-a-Car office is right at the hotel and there are many shops as well. If you want to eat out, there is no shortage of eateries to suit every taste and budget just steps away.

You have to cross a 3-lane road to get to the sidewalk and then to the beach. The worst part is, and this is not the fault of the hotel, is that the homeless population is out of control. The pavillions are filled with them, thereby rendering them useless to get out of the sun. They're laying all over the open areas, soliciting on the sidewalks and the cop cars were constantly parked right out front - breaking up fights and making arrests.

The location and view of the ocean was incredible. There are so many hotels in Waikiki that do not offer unobstructed views. Ours was perfect and worth the room upgrade.

The hotel was excellent in all respects. Check-in was straight-forward (at 5PM in the afternoon when we dragged our jet-lagged selves into the lobby) and my Marriott Gold Elite status was duly recognized. The room was clean and well equipped. Maid service was attentive and responsive to all requests (I left notes asking for, for example, extra Kleenex as I was recovering from a cold). The view of the ocean was restorative, as was the ability to relax on our private balcony. The balcony was of a very good size, including a lounger as well as table and chair. Most rooms in our vicinity had a balcony, but I am not sure if all hotel rooms have one. I recommend a balcony, and ideally an ocean view (although the view of Diamond Head is also spectacular). Food & Beverage service at this hotel was quite fine, generally. The room service approach is a casual one, eliminating the tray and delivering food in boxes. As a traditionalist I am not sure I quite like that, but my wife was fine with it. On our first night as we were so tired, we ordered room service, including one burger and one ""special"" type of sandwich--and asked if they could be split for sharing. Request was accommodated, and the food was quite good. Breakfast buffets were also quite decent--some different items in addition to the traditional eggs and bacon. A made-to-order omelet station (where one could also get fried eggs) was available too. Later in the week the breakfast buffet got busier, yet the staff sill do their best to get everyone seated as soon as possible. If you can eat before 7:30 AM or after 10AM, depending on the day you may miss some of the ""rush hour"". The Friday dinner buffet of Crab and Roast Beef was a very good value, although the room has no more ambience than at breakfast. I would suggest that in the evening the tables could be dressed with table cloths, perhaps some candles, just to ""smarten up"" the room somewhat. The hotel was well located--easy access (across the street with a light for safe crossing) to the ocean. Easy access to other parts of Waikiki too, albeit we just chilled at the pool or beach--mainly at the pool. Lovely loungers and the pool was pleasant for swimming. Attendants provided towels, and servers offered drinks--tried my first Mai-Tai at the pool and it was so good I had to try another! Kudos to the bartenders!Concierge service is available, including in advance of your stay for booked guests. The concierge got us on my ""bucket-list"" tour of Pearl Harbor, including out to the Arizona (tickets to go out to the memorial site must be arranged in advance, the concierge may be able to assist). For us the concierge used a company called Roberts Tours--they did a very good job; it made for a solemn yet good day at this important site. I found the concierge service very helpful generally, including with dining arrangements. We were very happy with the Marriott at Waikiki, no complaints (and those who read my reviews know that I am a ""hard marker""). We would definitely return to this hotel next time we travel to Honolulu. We also loved Honolulu, and found everyone very friendly.",Ontario,"Onttravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ontario</strong>",126,5.0

The room service was disappointing and served in a bag, no table to eat on. Breakfast used to be street level but is now on the 2nd floor. Also a bummer. No more outdoor dining. The Italian restaurant on the Ohua entrance was delicious so they frown on room charges, so we gave them a credit card. They obviously don't want to pay the hotel the commission when room charges are made. But the food was great. The bathroom sink was a double but the separate shower had old subway tiles, tiny, and needed upgrading. Overall for the price not a bad choice if you don't mind the street noise.

The room was comfortable, but they ""upgraded"" our room to an oceanview that was right next to the elevator. Big mistake. This hotel is 33 floors, so the elevators are relatively high speed. All we heard all day until about 1am is the sound of ""jets taking off"" as the elevators raced up and down. DO NOT let them put you in a room by the elevator. Fortunately, we were only here for 3 nights before going to Maui for 10 days, so we just sucked it up and got through it.

When i looked up the Marriott they were situated further up near the zoo. The resort fees were $36.65USD per night and wifi in the rooms was $15.65USD per day. They have free wifi in the foyer area, but i think this fee should be included in the resort fees especially for a 4.5 star resort. so i was not looking forward to be staying at the Marriott. But to my surprise on arrival at the Marriott it really surprised the 4 of us, they were very friendly on arrival and tried there best to have us stay near each other as there were 4 of us with 2 staying in each room. The rooms were large with 2 double beds in each with partial ocean view. The bathrooms were a little small but we did make it work. The balcony was nice we would sit out there to have our lunch or a drink enjoying the views. We were located across the road from the beach and really not that far from everything, we would walk the strip every night to look for food and shop. As for the wifi, not sure if it was that i informed them that i was a member of the Marriott hotel group (well i joined a few days before we left) but we got free wifi in our rooms as well. so all in all this hotel did surprise us and we all said we would stay here again.Just 1 little problem, one of the mornings we had some questions about tours we had to wait 45min only 2 people working in the morning with alot of people waiting.Thankyou","Sydney, Australia","Nancy095</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",84,4.0

I don't make the rules here, I use the id I am issued. On my most recent stay, they went as far as to say that they have notes in my account that say I am not to be given the government rate any more because of the way my id looks. Notes on my account? So now that hotel keeps notes on its guests separate from the general Marriott database. Furthermore, they had the wrong address for me (correct with the general Marriott database) and they had the wrong preferences (also correct with the general Marriott database). So clearly they keep a shadow database of guests with notes no one can view except that property. The woman who checked me in said that the general manager wants to eliminate the government rate at this property. Who is he to dictate what the Marriott does? I told her that I was on the big island the day before and that property did not hassle me. She said that the Waikiki location is ""the premier property in Hawaii"".

If you rent a car you can save money by eating outside of the Waikiki zone and getting your bottled water and snacks in the residential areas rather than on the boardwalk.Yelp stuff and don't rent surfboards on the beach. There are local merchants that rent boards for $25 a day just 1 block away from the water, but you pay $25 an HOUR when renting on the beach.The hotel itself is decent.

No executive lounge (as a platinum, I missed this) but the buffet breakfast provided was fine (and wait staff in the morning was terrific). Drink coupons did not include wine (beer, house rum punch, or soft drink were options). I would stay there again as it is the only Marriott property that near the beach.

Basically anyone we talked to was super friendly, very informative and tried to make sure we were having a good time/being taken care of. But I will say that the hotel is dated. It needs to be renovated badly. The first room we were given had a tub that basically was losing a layer of lacquer and was flaking badly. We were afraid they would cut our feet, especially our young kids so we asked for another room. While we waited, we also noticed a used band-aid stuck to the wall, so obviously their cleaning crew needs to be a little more attentive. The hotel apologized for that. In the next room we were given, there was the same issue with the tub, but this room came with a rubber mat to cover it...this explains why they haven't done anything to correct this...they just cover it up, but in the first room, there was no rubber mat. The tub was not the only old aspect...just the most obvious example of how dated the hotel is. Every aspect of the room and hotel is old...reminds me when I used to go to Hawaii in the 80's. I will say the location is ideal and the staff is great, so definitely makes up for the aged appearance.

When we arrived the woman at the front desk who checked us in said that we had been upgraded to a Diamond Head/ocean view room (due to gold level status with Marriott), but noted it had two double beds. We mentioned that we had requested a king room when we made the reservation and she didn't hesitate to call housekeeping to see if she could accommodate our request. She was able to offer us a king room on the 31st floor with a beautiful view of Diamond Head and the ocean. The room was spacious and clean. Bathroom was a bit small with basic amenities, but totally functional. Hotel staff was exceptionally helpful in explaining hotel amenities, restaurants, etc., and provided us with some coupons for free Mai Tais at one of the hotel restaurants. We also received some buffet breakfast coupons. The offerings at the buffet were great, including made to order omlettes. Hotel is not beachfront - but the beach is just across the street. And there are two pools on the property. Great to be able to walk out of the hotel and be right in the mix of things happening on Waikiki Beach.

The pools were a little small, but the drink and food service was good - quick and reasonably priced. Great view from the pool side grill. Food at the Japanese restaurant (Sansei) was delicious!!!Our room was clean, water pressure was good. Balcony was amazing with a great view. Loved having a fridge. Decor was simple, but worked. Power outlets in the bed side lamp were appreciated. Also, having a full length mirror was amazing - many Marriott's don't have full length mirrors. Closet had plenty of hangers and the safe was large enough to hold everything we wanted locked up. TV was huge and had good channel selections, and all the hook-ups if you wanted them. The walls were a little thin, so we did wake up a couple times. Ear plugs helped, but didn't silence everything. The other hotel across the street had live music until very late, which was nice while we were up sitting on the balcony, but kind of sucked when we wanted to hit the sack early. The spa was a little awkward, but our massages were good. Having the ABC stores in house made it easy to stock up on goodies and store them in the fridge. The location of the hotel couldn't be beat.

The lobby is beautiful, but of course you're not staying in the lobby, you stay in the room. In our opinion, the rooms are in desperate need of a makeover & update if they want to compete with other hotels on the Waikiki strip. Rooms are in even more desperate need of soundproofing!! We heard guests next door constantly, heard toilets flushing and tvs on in adjacent rooms...very poor soundproofing. We had a good view of the ocean from our room. Location of hotel is convenient for Diamond Head visits. Breakfast buffet has many, many options. Hotel restaurants are ok, but if you have a car, it's worth exploring other restaurants off-site. Other food options within short walking distance (2 blocks) are hard to come by. There are a few options, but for more dining options(and better ones), you must walk at least 7-8 blocks. (not too bad of a walk when the weather is beautiful and you're not in a rush). Definitely get reservations for dinner for any restaurant at which you want to sit down--or go early, like 5pm.Beach is across the street from hotel - there is no private beach area for hotel guests.We had a slough of issues during our stay and were not happy campers. However, Christian was wonderful and addressed our concerns with the utmost professionalism and kindness. He took care and did a phenomenal job to remedy our situation. Again, he was wonderful.

The supervisor immediately provided a trade for extra breakfasts for the drink coupons.

Gorgeous spot on the beach— walking distance to everything. The beach is much less crowded here than further down by the Hilton. We enjoyed the zoo (a two-minute walk from the hotel), and did some exploring on our own. I recommend renting a car at least for part of your trip. There is so much more you can do and see in Oahu if you aren't held back by walking distance. I suppose you can take a taxi or uber, but it would add up quick, as the north shore is a good 1 to 1.5 hours away from Waikiki. The hotel itself has wonderful staff. Richard at the front desk moved us to a room further from the elevators because they are noisy and run constantly. You can still hear them all night, even down the hall, but it's less noticeable. Perfect view of the ocean/beach and city from our room. I recommend being on the right side of the hotel. We only ate at the hotel's Moana Terrace once, and it was decent for appetizers and drinks. We preferred trying out places around the area with happy hour specials, and local eats. I'm giving 4 stars because our experience was very good, but I just wish it was an all-inclusive. Maybe I just miss that part, having stayed at all-inclusives before. There aren't any all-inclusives in Hawaii, so I'd say this is the next best thing due to its central location. It would be nice to have a breakfast option in the hotel that didn't cost over $60 for two people at the buffet. We didn't even try it because there are breakfast spots in walking distance. Would love more affordable food options. Overall, excellent stay. Very clean room (coming from someone with allergies and asthma), extremely nice staff.

Good location, not too crowded or busy (in the hotel itself), genuinely friendly staff, and (important) prompt service for business travelers in the restaurant at breakfast.The downside, however, is despite the name, this didn't feel like a resort but rather a very nice convention style hotel with a bigger pool area. It is across the street from Waikiki beach but the street is very busy and definitely feels like you are in the city rather than what I would think of a resort. It is, however, not as crowded as the other big HNL resorts like the Sheraton or Hilton Hawaiian Village. I would recommend this hotel to biz travelers, people not wanting a crowded resort, or those just crashing at the hotel and spending most of their time exploring the area. Also, I see a few complaints about the cost of the breakfast buffet - that is standard for most Honolulu hotels. Everything is more expensive on the island. Other pros: fast elevators (slow elevators in towers are a pet peeve of mine), nice gym, lots of on site restaurants, and good benefits for Marriott elite members (free daily drink, discounts on food, etc).

The resort fee was not a surprise and does have some value, but is likely a hard sell for the company. For $30, we got four breakfasts and a number of drink coupons for the two of us. The person checking us in handled it well and recommended a couple of effective strategies. It wasn't a knockout factor but you need to be aware of it.That being said, we had an excellent experience. We took a deluxe ocean view room on the 22nd floor. The room was large and well equipped. The views were really special and worth considering the upgrade. The meals that we ate at the hotel were quite good. Pricing for breakfast is very ambitious- buffet is $32.95. Quality is very good with a lot of variety but that is pretty expensive in my mind. We ate in the pool lounge and had an evening meal in the restaurant and both were quite good, complemented by stunning sunsets.. Honolulu in general is pricey and these meals were not out of synch with others that we saw. I recommend going a block or two back from the beach to get more options if the view is not important to you. Overall, our stay at the Marriott was a high point of the trip. All of the staff were helpful and friendly. There is a makeup shop on sight where the sales people are a little too aggressive but I was comfortable just walking away.

Eating by the pool or getting drinks served is impossible as no one ever comes by. The resort fee is $30 and for that you get a breakfast coupon and 4 free drinks. But as a platinum member, you don't get the usual breakfast for 2. Now I should say that's not uncommon at resorts but here your Platinum status gets you nothing...yes I got 1 free breakfast but I really paid for it thru the resort fee Also I was not offered my guaranteed room type. Normally this results in $100 compensation for MR members but I was told that they do not honour that policy.

Unfortunately, Waikiki has a very large homeless population which is probably due to it's outrageous cost of living.

Our included free breakfast buffet was served in the most DREARY and DRAB room located on the same floor as the pool.

Rooms were always sooo clean. I really praise the house keeping, they were great! Never moved your belongings just made them more orderly. We stayed over the Christmas/Nee Year period so very very busy. Restaurants you need to Book in advance but the steakhouse was so delicious! Location is perfect. Right across the road from the beach and on the main strip. Trolleys and Tram leave from outside the hotel. Inside the rooms, beds were big, TV was huge. Bathrooms a little small - but fine. Only two things I think could improve was breakfast - $32USD for a very average buffet. Very very expensive. Plenty of other options around. Concierge was always EXTREMELY busy. To Book any trips you often had to wait 30-45 mins to get to speak to anyone, at one point waited over an hour to simply book a seat on the bus to the outlets in WeikeleI recommend Marriott to everyone. Two swimming pools, gym, so close to beach, ABC store for your everyday needs, can book all trips from the concierge, friendly staff (especially house keeping, she even wrote hand made cards and cookies for Christmas).

I stay at hotels at least 10 days out of every month. I have stayed at the highest rated hotels and some that were, let's just say, ""dated"". This hotel certainly falls within the first category - Excellent.Yes, the location is tremendous. Yes, the restaurants are wonderful. Yes the shops located within the hotel have everything you would ever need. But what really makes this hotel so special is the people who work there. From the helpful parking staff, who always great you with a smile and ask how they can help. To the room service waiters who deliver your food with a smile and genuinely thank you for staying at the resort. While they are all very professional, one in particular stand out. Ms. Lynn Matsumura is one of those people that are most memorable for me. She is courteous, friendly, professional, respectful and, most importantly, truly cares about the experience of the resort guests. She takes the time and asks the right questions to do what she can to make your stay at the resort as wonderful as possible. I wish all of the hotels I stay at had a Ms. Matsumura! I am typically in Honolulu every few months. Over the past 90 days I have chosen to stay at this resort on both of my business trips to Honolulu. My clients are located on the other side of the Island. and it would be much more convenient to stay on the North Shore. However I continually choose to stay at this hotel because Ms. Matsumura and her team always go above and beyond, helping to make me feel ""at home"".

The hotel is huge with shopping and restaurants galore. But the first floor architecture is absolutely stunning with a fusion of Western, Asian, and Hawaiian influences. Our rooms were very large and we were upgraded to a spacious three-bed suite. The rooms are large and extremely clean. One of our rooms had a view of the ocean which was very nice.Waikiki is one of the nicest city beaches in the US easily rivaling or surpassing Miami Beach or the LA Beach Cities. The Marriott is just across the street from this world-famous location. The resort restaurants are expensive, as are most restaurants in Oahu, but variety and service are exquisite. The views of the beach are really nice, and you lose sight of the fact that you are in a major Hawaiian city.

The hotel is across the street from the beach and there are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. First impressions are important to me, so I was surprised there was not a valet or anyone out front greeting guests and directing them to the check-in desk or helping with luggage. I arrived about three hours ahead of check-in time and was told they were sold out the previous night so no rooms were available for an early check-in (understandable, but only if you don't know better). I explained to my guest services agent that I was a longtime Hilton Diamond member and this was my first stay at a Marriott in a number of years - he became quite helpful and was able to not only have a room immediately available, it was an upgrade from what I booked. He also provided me with bottled water and drink tickets that had not been offered previously (thank you!) and gave me the rundown on the property and restaurants. After my guest services agent's accommodating service, I had high hopes that I just may be switching my loyalty to Marriott - that was short-lived. They do not yet have the mobile room key available - not a big deal, but not as convenient as having the key readily available on your phone. The room was comfortable, but the air conditioner was extremely loud and pretty irritating while trying to sleep. The décor in the room is probably due for an upgrade, but it wasn't horrible. I would put the room more in the category of a Hilton Garden Inn - basic, but meets the needs for sleeping comfortably. The bathroom was extremely small, but the vanity area was a nice size; horrible lighting though. Speaking of lighting, almost all of the lights have to be turned on individually - only one light switch in the bathroom and one by the front door which was only for the one light by the door when you walk in. The bed was comfortable and the balcony was equipped with a table and two chairs. I tried calling housekeeping three times for an extra blanket before giving up on my request. The room service menu is well below average; the offerings are minimal and the food really wasn't that good. I paid $64 for a pizza and a piece of cake - don't waste your money! There are two pool areas and there is plenty of seating at the larger pool area, sufficient seating at the smaller pool and towels are readily available at both, but, apparently, only one of them offers poolside ""service"". This was my biggest issue with the hotel. For an experienced traveler, customer service is high on my list and this hotel was seriously lacking in just about every aspect. The service at the pool lounge was horrible! The servers look at you but never actually ask you if you need help. From what I could tell, they specialize in standing around! It wasn't like the place was packed when I was there, a small to moderate crowd at best. I had to track down a server every time I wanted to order food or drinks. Generally, when you are ordering alcohol, you can barely finish your glass before another is offered...not here! I literally sobered up between drinks!! Based on the comment by the gentleman near me (this service is ruining my buzz), I wasn't the only one who was irritated with the service. This happened both days I went so I just stopped going. I think looking at you and not offering assistance must be a theme for this location because when I checked out I was once again looked at but not offered any assistance until I finally tracked someone down and asked them to call a taxi for me. Overall, I did not receive anywhere near the level of service I receive from Hilton brands or the level I expect from any upscale hotel. I definitely will not return to this hotel based solely on their lack of customer service, but, if you are looking for a decent hotel with a great location (but lacking any type of customer service) then this is the place for you. It's an average hotel so your rate should reflect that. I wouldn't recommend paying for an upscale hotel and staying at this location.","Sacramento, California","sactraveler365</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",6,3.0

I stayed in the 'K' building so this is strictly related to that area. The higher marks go to the pool area, all the great seating areas both outside and inside, my room balcony with 2 chairs and a lounger, and a decent size room with a seating area couch, lots of walking space, office desk. The breakfast buffet choices and its staff were amazing, the lobby area was large and new, and the location directly in front of the beach is perfect. . The 3 star part goes towards the 'rest' of the room. I stayed in a 32 stack, it's a corner, and the size was pretty large which I appreciated. Not sure why all corners have two queen beds (would have preferred one king) from what I was told. The closet has a stack that prevents the hanger from using that section so you lose an entire foot of hanging space, and the closet itself and the doors should be updated. The mini fridge and coffee counter are located in the bathroom - would rather not leave my food and make my coffee in a bathroom (cannot understand any hotel that has this type of set up). I'm a Plat member, so would have appreciated water in the mini daily. I like the double sink in there, lots of counter space. The shower, which is separate from the tub, is tiny, and other than a small holder that barely holds a bar of soap, there is no place for your shower toiletries in there at the same time as you. You keep them on the floor of the shower, and it invites a fall - not very smart for a hotel. Having a tub that is guaranteed little use over the shower is a waste of space. The worst part though is that there is a shower head that points directly in front of you, but will only hit you if you are 5'10 or taller. It's inconvenient to use this type of shower head in your hand during your entire shower. I tried to point it to the corner and got on my toes to try to wash out my hair. WIFI did not work on the balcony of my room, and was often slow during the day so they should look at getting this upgraded. If you want a boutique hotel, this isn't the place. There are alot of people, but there is also alot of space. All the staff I dealt with were great, but I didn't use alot of their 'extra' services. I come to Honolulu once a year and usually stay on this end of the strip. It was my first time at this hotel however, and certainly an upgrade from my previous spot, so so I'll return .. but do something about the showers.","Toronto, Canada","pebblelake</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",104,4.0

Over the holidays we thought it would be nice to come back and stay here because the location IS perfect, and the balcony is a great way to see the sunset every night.In order to stay here for 5 nights, it cost me 240,000 points. On top of that, and in order to ensure an ocean view and a KING sized bed it cost me an additional $150 (PLUS the $30 resort fee) per night. It was NOT worth it. I could have taken my chances to be upgraded at the time of arrival, but I didn't want to miss out on a beach view or have the king bed. Back in February they told me the corner suites only had 2 beds which they call QUEEN but trust me, they're no bigger than a full size bed. The tub/shower is not Marriott worthy - the shower head is pointed right at your face and cannot be moved. Rugs are old and dirty. The concierge NEVER returned my email requesting information on a particular tour, and this was BEFORE we checked in. The manager was non-responsive after we checked in - perhaps he knew we really had no choice or say in our accommodations after check in. On departure, when we tried to request a bellman, it took over 30 minutes for someone to arrive, and that was only after I went down to the front desk and stood there - and got ignored by Lisa (the manager?) for the most part. She kept taking care of other guests until I mentioned we were there first. She was incredibly rude.The final straw which made me really mad was my request for a late checkout (3 PM) and they'd only grant me a 1 PM departure at the latest.

Beach is across the street and the rest of Waikiki is only blocks away. We've been loyal Marriott patrons for over a decade and always look for their brands - so naturally, when we planned this Hawaii trip we looked for a Marriott. This is one of their older resorts - so no lounge available for Marriott Elite members. They did throw in one breakfast per day (should have been one for each guest) & a few other 'elite member' benefits; but you end of paying for all of it with the daily resort fee. We were told our room was upgraded - but it was the same room I reserved/paid for, so bad info provided at checkin. The room was large, bed was very comfortable, TV was huge and the balcony appropriate size to relax & enjoy the sun; although the bathroom was tiny. Lobby area was airy, spacious and abound with shops - so you did not need to go far for food, coffee, or souvenirs. All in all, an average resort that needs an overall makeover. Did not appreciate the daily resort and/or hefty parking fee - thought it should have been waived or reduced for elite members.","Vancouver, Washington","oldranger81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Washington</strong>",174,3.0

It was about 5 or 6 years since we had stayed here and there were some changes.We always stay in the K Tower (like it the best) and our room seemed to have been updated since we were last here. We had a deluxe ocean view room and couldn't have asked for better. Our balcony had 2 chairs and a chaise lounge and a view of Waikiki Beach. Friday night we were able to watch the Hilton Hawaiian Village fireworks from this balcony. The resort fee was still there but Elite Members were offered breakfast coupons for the buffet in lieu of some minor perks (price was approximately $32 apiece so a good deal). Do miss the free bottled water, but with the ABC stores right there - not a big deal. Enterprise has taken over the Hertz Rental spot, but turned out to be an excellent experience with them (do book in advance from home, especially over the holidays, and do join their rewards program).Over the years, we've stayed at several other hotels in Waikiki, but keep coming back to the Marriott. Love the location - nearness to Starbucks and the beach, and walkable to all the good restaurants, yet not in the middle of the most crowded areas.

Insufficient closet and drawer space required us to virtually live out of our suitcases. In addition, the room was noticeably out dated and the carpet had numerous stains. The grout in the bathroom, between the beige tile and tub, was blackish. Whether they used gray grout or it had some mold in it is not clear. This is not a category 8 resort.

That special ran out on Labor Day, so I felt pretty good about the price considering how rates kept on rising for all the Waikiki hotels closer to Christmas. I kept checking other hotels because of the negative reviews I saw on Trip Advisor... Once we got there, I felt that price was fair for the room we received, but all the extra charges are not warranted in my book. They add an extra mandatory $30 per day resort fee, plus $34 per day parking fee to just park in the garage. Why??? Because they can... no real value here for guests. I can see paying $10 per day or something more reasonable if they have to charge in the first place. The beds were full size (not queen) so we asked for a roll-away for our teenage daughter (we were a small family of three in the room) and they were going to add an additional $30 per day for that too.... I kindly asked if they could waive that since I was loyal to the brand and already paying so much for all the other ""extras"". They did waive that fee, but I felt like I was being nickeled and dimed to death... All the taxes and fees added nearly $200 more per night to our room charge!The beds were extremely comfortable, with high quality sheets. I slept very good every night (an uncommon experience whenever I'm away from my own bed). Kudos to Marriott for this feature. I also liked the refrigerator in the room. No free bottles of water though, which would have been a nice touch for guests. We stayed at the Waikiki Hyatt Regency for one night prior to our cruise, and I honestly liked it better. The cost was about the same per night after Marriott added their extra chargess. For the same money, Hyatt had a nicer room. It had a more upscale feel, was larger, and even had a bidet in the bathroom. The maid at Marriott was exceptionally sweet.

The hotel is right across from a beach with a protective wall so young children can swim there safely, and it's also centrally located with plenty of shopping and restaurants nearby. The breakfast is good if if it's complimentary, as others have commented, but not really worth the $32 if you have to pay for it.

We found our room larger than expected, clean, in fine shape physically, not tired and worn and with a larger and more comfortable balcony than expected. I would have liked firmer pillows - that booking request was not fulfilled. But, all in all, we were pleasantly surprised that the quality of the room was better than anticipated. Some complain about the cost, but it was obvious to me that booking a location on Waikiki for less than $300 was not going to come with luxury resort-style amenities. I can't complain about what we received.The restaurants were convenient and quite good quality. Several evenings we had our dinner and drinks on our balcony. Easy to do. The on-premise shopping was all too tempting. Really enjoyed this, even if my pocketbook didn't. Laundry facilities were a nice bonus. My only complaint was the parking garage. Although very convenient on premise and easily accessed from major streets, the narrow ramps and sharp corners made each journey in and out rather exciting. Thank goodness other drivers were as careful rounding the blind corners as we were. The garage situation would not prevent me from staying - and parking - at the Marriott again. I understand the shortage of space in the area, and it is a bonus to have close parking available at all.Staff was very good. Several times employees went out of their way to get us bottled water, extra coffee and tea and other amenities.

But I used to smoke on the balcony and ash in a can. No one said anything. All in all? Had no trouble staying there for a week. Enjoyed the shops beneath, it's proximity to everything and the amenities. Well maintained. Great housekeeping. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 stars? Was the size of the room. That's about it ;)Right across the road from the swimming area.

Old and badly in need of repair, remodel and maintenance. The rooms are small. We saw two rooms. One on the 26th floor and one on the 4th floor. The bed on the 26th floor was hard and the beds on the 4th floor were soft. Much better beds on the 4th floor. The reason we saw the room on the 26th floor is because that was the ""upgraded full ocean view room"" they said they gave us at no request from us. I don't think that is an upgrade. The nose bleed section is what that was. And yes there is a balcony with a working door. I would not step onto that balcony that high up. Tiny little balcony with a short iron rail. Wind howling. We called down and told them they can offer this upgraded view room to the next guest and we would be happy with a room on floor 1-10 if possible looking at a wall rather than this. It was not a full ocean view anyway and if there was anything to see on the ocean from that far away you'd not see it through the tree tops. Silly. So on the 4th floor (which I think is the lowest floor with guest rooms) the room is more square than rectangle. Nice large tv. Bigger balcony with two chairs and a lounge chair and a view of the pool deck possibly used for events and over flow and such. Much better than the Tiny 26th floor windswept balcony. The bathrooms were identical. Tiny. Sink area then a door with the shower and commode. No frills at all. Stained and scratched toilet seat and the sink gurgled randomly day and night and at times BLACK FOAMY GRITTY WATER rose up from the drain of the sink and when the water went back down it left a nasty black mess! It also had a small leak at the hot water handle. We called down and asked them to check on this and we left the room. Maintenance came while we were gone but didn't come in the room because the do not disturb sign was on the door. No problem. We called them to find out the status of the repair and they told us no entry was made due to the sign on the door and a very nice maintenance man arrived a few minutes later. He said there isn't anything he can do right away with the water backing up as it probably is caused in another area of the buildings plumbing and he can't fix the leak at the hot water handle because he needs to shut off the water and install a new seat. Think he said he needed a new seat too?) He was absolutely correct on both issues. We didn't want to relocate to another room and we knew we were checking out the next day so we dealt with the gurgle all night and black stuff. I'm guessing the back flow and seat problem didn't start the hour before we took the room and could have been caught and repaired before the next guests paying $300-400 per night took the room? Or maybe they knew it was set for repair and gave us the room after calling down to be relieved from the upgraded nose bleed section? Have no idea. Not cool tho. The common areas of the hotel are okay. Lots of shops. A small pool and bar area on the 3rd floor over looking he street and beach with a few restaurants. Seattles best coffee in the main lobby area open air. The Marriott in Kauai was much much much better in every way. This is probably the worst Marriott I've ever seen. When you walk out of the hotel the beach is just across the street. It's a beach with coarse sand and pebbles all over it and it has a man made wave break that is an eye sore. (Much better beaches as you walk northwest) You also have to walk past and sit among several beggars and homeless folks. They are everywhere. Some sleeping, some having loud curse filled conversations with other homeless folks while smoking cigars and cigarettes. The homeless folk aren't the Marriotts problem of course I know that. Apparently not many people care about the bad beaches and the homeless sleeping along the beach and sidewalk as the area is FULL of folks walking/jogging around all day. This Marriott has many more problems of their own to worry about above and beyond the ridiculous environment here on what once was a beautiful paradise. We had no desire to be at Wakiki beach once we saw it and this Marriott was no escape. The Americans and the Asians and the homeless have taken over and it's sad. No Hawaiians or culture anywhere to be found. Very few people even say Aloha and Mahalo. It's all good morning, hello and thank you. As for location? Yes this dirty, dysfunctional, outdated Marriott sits in the middle of a busy, nasty, ugly useless beach. I'll not be coming back to this area ever again. Spend your money somewhere else.

It is located on the very south side of Waikiki. Highly recommend this hotel. Only reason it did not receive 5 stars from me is purely on the hotel like most in Waikiki being originally built over 40 years ago and size of pool (also due to that fact) but hey you have a big ocean pool right in front of the hotel! Having an ABC store inside the hotel was also convenient. Lots of restaurants, shopping, bars, etc. nearby the hotel.Room was clean with a very comfortable bed. Bathroom is very small which is not unexpected considering the age of the building. All the furnishings are modern. Shower is powerful but not a rain shower. The breakfast downstairs was decent, nothing spectacular. The bar on the 3rd floor overlooks Waikiki Beach and had nice performing acts each night. Besides the great views I was impressed with the service levels considering how the hotel is really a large convention type hotel. First we arrived early from Japan so we were given a key to use a shower until our room was ready. The bell desk was extremely friendly staff (tall big guy) who gave us some water to cool off and provided us with some stellar advice. The Marriott Special Services Desk for elite members was able to check us in early and really made us feel special. Breakfast staff was nice but also very efficient. Housekeeper provided us with extra hotels as requested through the Marriott App. In regards to some of the other reviews I've read I have to say I did feel like we got some good benefits being a Gold Member especially considering its a resort. These were not listed in our booking. And on the ocean with the breakwater I do agree its good for kids but its definitely not swimmable for adults as the water barely comes up above the waist. I suggest going a bit further up the beach if you want to truly enjoy the water. I would definitely stay here again. Kudos to the staff and management.

At least this hotel gives you coupons for a newspaper, free drinks and a buffet breakfast, but on the whole, I'd just rather the hotel increase their room charges rather than this tactic. I don't mind paying appropriately for a stay in a nice hotel. This hotel features two towers, one closer to the water than the other. Many rooms provide a side-on view of the water. The area is pretty happening, so bonus for those who enjoy the nightlife and the feel of a busy city. The pool is small but has a true deep end, and it was salt-water, which is so much more pleasant than chlorine. There is a bar at the pool and you can order food there; also in the area are tables with a view over the beach. There was live music in that location the evening we were there as well.

In our experience as experienced travellers, this was not the case. I feel the money that was spent for the 2 rooms was not of the value and the standard that was promised on a video displayed and was not of the true vision that we believed we were investing in. It turned out a horrible holiday. Below are the issues that had occurred.- Rooms were requested to be close to each other as our son was staying in the same hotel. The result was that the rooms were at each end of the building- My wife and my room (which was supposed to have a Queen or KingSize bed) had 2 single beds. I had to go down to receptionto request a change. When requesting for this, the staff were quite rude and cameacross as they did not care. After a discussion that was notrequired on a holiday, they shifted us to another room. Still a fairdistance from my son’s room.- The quality of the rooms were quite demeaning with torn carpets,lamps shades that were bent, view from the balcony waslooking onto a ash felt roof with an industrial air conditioner which was loudespecially when trying to sleep at night, cigarette butts on the balcony, a looseelectrical wire at the door leading to the balcony. Missingbalcony door lock. Coffee machine with paper cups in the rooms (this I not a standard of a 4 Star hotel).- Noise levels from the hotel across the road was quite loud. Withlate night entertainment and tourist buses continuallystopping directly across from our room. Windows are usually double glazedespecially in a 4 star rated hotel to reduce the levels as much possible Thisis expected in cities in cases like this. I was told by the manager that the single panewindows did the job required and that all cities are noisy.My response to that was that I have stayed in cities that operate 24/7 inthe middle of the CBD and I have never experienced this. Mentioning I have stayed incities like Singapore, Hong Kong and London to name a few.When requesting to either refund for the remaining days to go toanother hotel or relocate to another 2 rooms in the hotelwhere there was less noise and of a 4 star quality. His response was hedidn't really care if we selected to leave,to take it up with the tourist agent.Eventually we did get relocated after your discussion with themand my Insistence if there was no refund there was to be aupgrade, even if it meant a view to the hills that we paid for.-The staff apart from 2 people were extremely discourteous as theyviewed Australians as a low tipping opportunity comparedto the people from Japan, China and South Korea.

This one is right across the street from the beach. The only problem I have with this resort is there is still a problem with the homeless people at this end of Waikiki. While on vacation it's disconcerting to see someone passed out on the sidewalk. This has been on ongoing problem in Waikiki for the thirty plus years we've been going there so we're used to seeing it. To be very honest you either look the other way and save money or spend more and stay at the other end of Waikiki. It is a well patrolled area but there are still panhandlers asking for spare change. The beach area is our favorite because of the break water and calmer water. The hotel employees are excellent.

The front desk staff was great upon check-in and the bell staff was great at checkout too. While I still hate having the $30 resort fee tacked on for things like internet and newspaper that I should be receiving for free as a Marriott Platinum member, at least it also included free DVD rentals (which I didn't use given I was in Hawaii!) and a free drink at the bar each night. The best value was the free breakfast buffet certificate given for being Platinum as $35/person is quite steep for breakfast in my opinion.The location of the hotel can't be beat. It's basically a block from Waikiki beach and if you're lucky enough to have a room that faces the beach, the view from the balcony of the room is incredible, especially at sunset. It's far enough down the beach too that you're a bit more isolated from all the tourist activity that goes on more towards the malls and other hotels farther up the road, which is nice if you're looking moreso to relax than partake in shopping.The room was adequate in size given you're in Hawaii, so you shouldn't be spending a whole lot of time in the room to begin with! During my stay the hotel was in the process of upgrading its TV's from 37 inch to 55 inch, which is huge in a room of that size. The A/C does get a little chilly in the room after spending the day outside in the heat and humidity of Waikiki.I didn't eat any meals at the hotel restaurants during my stay as there's a bunch of other restaurants within walking distance of the hotel that seemed to be a better value than the hotel ones. There's also a bunch of shops in both the lobby and on the first floor of the hotel where you can get everything from jewelry and cosmetics to souvenirs and drinks, which is great if you choose not to rent a car while staying here.I also did not use the pools or the fitness center so cannot speak to those but know the hotel had both available for guests to use.

Booked because of my Marriott Awards!!! Best thing I ever could have done. I love the Boston Marriott Back Bay so thought try this. From the moment I arrived I was greeted with Aloha. While a large property the lobby is incredible and easy to navigate and not so large it takes too long to get somewhere. The atmosphere is Hawaiian with quiet understated luxury. The staff was so incredibly happy and service was wonderful. My room was in the front tower- a corner so you have direct West view of ocean (and it doesn't take a high floor to be happy) and almost a whole wall with lanai of Waikiki beach to the North. Palm tree tops waving below my lanai. Not sure how they number the stacks by my room ended in 33. I want to return just for the comfort of the room. Spacious (maybe bigger than others). Fridge, double granite bathroom sinks with elegant fixtures. Wonderful bedding and mattress AND totally quiet-very little traffic noise which surprised me even on Halloween night. They are a green hotel so your choice on laundry. Totally separate glass shower which if you love hot water pressure THIS was a treat. Never any trouble with elevator. At first I objected to the Resort Fee when I booked. There is a reason!!! Each morning received a coupon for breakfast buffet. Worth far more than daily fee. And I mean buffet. Separate egg station for whatever style you wish. Omelets done to perfection. Fruits, to pancakes, to hot items to congee to Japanese. All with incredibly fresh coffee. Oh and the Mai Thai punch coupons for each day- that are actually good. Bright interior that was fun to walk into with a sigh of instant relaxation. There are 3 other main restaurants I'll review at their site- Sansei- Sushi and Seafood, DK was adjoining and had steaks and seafood. Lobby level Italian-Arancino DiMare. Also a poolside area, the Moana Terrace. So much within this complex you could treat yourself and not leave. Morning activities offered such as Yoga, Hula lessons (dang it next time). SO well located. Beach not as crowded as in center of Waikiki. Directly across street from hotel. Walk south along the sidewalk by beach and there is the park and a small zoo. Aquarium a must. Walk north into the hub of shopping (though MANY GREAT shops on property!) and you can entertain yourself for hours. One morning I left on a walk only to discovered I had ambled for 4 1/2 hours. Tired feet. The bus system is a must they make it so easy. Each stop has a plaque that identifies location with a number and phone number to call. A bus route plaque also displays the routes stopping there and their number. There is an automated system that when calling you can enter the route number and will be quickly told when it arrives and if it has just departed. They run frequently. And if you don't know what number to catch just ask any bus driver . Avoid nimitz highway at rush hour . I was there for a retreat of sorts having just lost my husband and had a funeral to attend so staying on site suited me perfectly. There is also a back tower that I have not seen. Be wary of cab drivers as some do not know their way around (or seem not to) so you could get stuck with unwarranted costs. I just can't say enough positive for this Marriott. Years back I worked at several hotels so I tend to expect more. This location exceeded my expectations so much so that when I return to Kona in the future I will plan a stop off in Waikiki just to stay at this location.","Cambridge, Massachusetts","NottageCottageHawaii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts</strong>",23,5.0

It is less crowded on this end. The beach across the street is protected with a lava wall making it perfect for a relaxing floating, swimming area for families. The hotel has 2 nice pools on the 3rd floor which is great. Plenty of space between lounge chairs. Food can also be ordered from the lounge chairs. A fitness room is next to the pool in 1 tower and a restaurant with live entertainment next to the pool on the other tower. Rooms are clean and nice. Some have very nice views too.

The balcony was weird as it is a slab of rounded concrete and you can only see over it if you're standing. The views are beautiful. The beach is public and not directly connected to the hotel so i would have liked to have beach towels also in the room and not only by the pool. There is a vendor to rent chairs and umbrellas and other beach items. The hotel itself is nice overall. Upon checkin we received 2 mini waters and chocolates. There is a water station available during regular business hours which is for use with the hotel paper cone cups but you can refill a bottle by tearing off the small end of the cup and using it as a funnel into a water bottle so to avoid putting a bottle to the water station spout. We had an issue with the hotel and cruise line communication. The cruise line booked one night of our hotel, while we booked the extra night before the cruise. The cruise lines directions were to leave our baggage in our room which will be picked up to accompany us in our shuttle to the cruise ship. We followed the directions but somehow the bags were left behind. This was the cruise lines fault but between 11am and 7pm when the cruise line confirmed with the hotel that the bags were left behind, the hotel itself should have discovered the bags left behind and should have also made attempts to contact us in some way. I was pretty disappointed since my expectations of Marriott are of high service and quality and I expected better. Despite my disappointment for proactive measures, I have to commend Jonathan- I believe he was the bellhop manager. He spoke with me several times and provided detail information on the actions needed to get my luggage to the next port of call. He was my only insight into what was being done since the cruise line was not that transparent with their actions. Overall, the stay at this hotel was comfortable and nice. I would return but will continue to have high expectations. ",,Marlene L,27,3.0

We elected to stay at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Hotel and Spa. We chose this property for its location on Waikiki beach since it offered ocean view, proximity to the beach, and proximity to Pearl Harbor. Having had more time to research our room view, I would have either upgraded the room based on expense, or not have spent as much for the view we had. The room was ocean view, and, yes we could see the ocean, as well as Diamond Head (extinct volcano). However, the view of these sites was from between high rise buildings. I did not take the time to call the hotel to find out exactly what “ocean view” we had, which I have done in the past. I have learned the only way to have an unobstructed view without ambiguity is “ocean front”. For these reasons, I would not detract from a very good rating for this hotel; after all, we could see the ocean, as well as Diamond Head, if not framed by buildings. I will include pictures of these views.The room itself was nice with a small balcony, but catching a glimpse of the scenic aspect of the view between hotel towers isn’t where I could say I would spend time to do so. The service was good, as I would expect from a Marriott, but the room had the smallest bathroom area I’ve encountered at a Marriott property. A pocket door was needed to separate the bath/commode from the vanity area. The rest of the room was spacious and comfortable. The room has a mini refrigerator, safe, etc; check the room amenities on their web site for the full list.An unexpected delight was to be visited by two white dives on our balcony each day, and they would even venture a short distance into the room if the door was left open. We could tell at least one was the same because the poor thing was missing a foot, but it got around just fine. The hotel is an immense facility that offers every amenity. The pool deck is very good, as well as any of the exercise/spa facilities. The hotel facility takes up an entire city block, right up to Kalakaua Ave. that separates the hotel to Waikiki Beach itself. One can walk from the lobby of the hotel to Kalakaua Ave. on the first floor where there are multitudes of shops. There are a range of restaurants on property: From the classic “Marriott Bistro” to upscale restaurants.If it’s a quick inexpensive bite to eat, right at the corner of Kalakaua Avenue ( runs parallel to Waikiki Beach) and Kalakaua Avenue (the official street the hotel is on), a one block walk, is a Burger King, complete with surf boards for door handles. Further down, after taking a right at Kalakaua Avenue, there is a plethora of eating establishments within a few block walk. There is a McDonald’s of course, Eggs and Things, and Cheeseburgers in Paradise (great burgers) within two blocks, and further down a California Pizza Kitchen. About a mile down (not a bad walk) is The Hard Rock Café Honolulu.Within the mile from the hotel and the Hard Rock, one will find just about every high end store along that stretch; the stores that don’t sell anything under $1,500; Gucci, Louis-Vuitton, Coach, Harry Winston Jewelers, etc. Of course, there many other gift shops, and stores with clothing.Need something you forgot to bring or buy? There is a chain of stores simply called ABC Stores that were on the three islands we visited: Oahu, Hawaii (Big Island), and Maui. They can be found on almost every street or corner, literally. The hotel lobby had one, as well as the entrance to the hotel courtyard on Kalakaua Avenue. They have beer, wine, water, snacks, fresh fruit, a number of items you would look for in a drug store for (Tylenol, other OTC medications),nail clippers, souvenirs,…the list goes on.Oahu /Waikiki Beach seemed to be the most expensive place we stayed out of the three islands we visited. Another mistake I made with this hotel is that we had a $30/day resort fee, and we didn’t use any of the resort facilities for our arrival and short stay with a tour scheduled each day. Although the room rate was not bad for the location, the taxes and the resort fee added almost $67/day to the bill. Ouch!If one is looking for a large resort hotel with all of the amenities one could want, this hotel is for you, however, in retrospect, I would have tried to find a hotel in Waikiki Beach without the resort fee, since we didn’t plan on using the facilities for our stay.",orlandoflorida,"orlandotourist</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>orlandoflorida</strong>",132,4.0

Comments just on breakfast later.We received on check-in 8 coffee/mai tai vouchers as expected, and a blue ActivityPackage card ($30 daily paid by LE) with listed continuous benefits, except the 2 mai tai/coffee cards were one offs. Local and international phone calls and wifi were included. Unfortunately the free newspaper was free download of an app to download the newspaper on your laptop which of course all people take on their ‘vacation’. The gymnasium was exceptional, the back pool small and closed for cleansing I believe only for a couple of days. All good. Downside - Our room was in the Paoakalani Tower, almost a block from the beach. To get a triple upgrade one has to have four grades of rooms below the one you are in. We were put in the upper level of the old tower with good distant water views. According to staff there are 2 ‘grades’ in that tower, water (Diamond head/water, and city/water), and partial water glimpses/non-water rooms. Our room was smaller with a mini balcony, compared to the rooms in Kealohilani tower which are essentially road/beach front.So the Triple up-grade term is, in all probability a furphy.Breakfast - advertised as a 2 for 1 buffet, in fact it is a 2 for 1 Hot buffet (expensive) and we could not get 2 for 1 continental breakfasts - which are our preferred type, well we could, but we had to pay for one Hot Full breakfast A$48 anyway. The continental breakfast was acceptable, the full hot breakfast we found below par, in both variety and standard. After the first morning we ate out. The other meals in the restaurants were very good. The resort is in front of the part of the beach with a sea wall swimming area, this was excellent clean calm, up to 1.5m, with easy access.

I have two requests on my Marriott profile, highest floor possible and 2 extra foam pillows. They delivered neither. Our room was on floor 8 out of 32. No extra pillows. I had to ask 2 more times before someone delivered them. The hotel is overdue for a renovation. The rooms, though clean, look tired. The carpet and furniture are old. The bathroom fixtures look worn and dated. Our upgraded room had a partial water view over the tall palm trees and it was a bit wider than the standard size.

The room was cleaned daily and restocked. The entry to resort is open and airy with lots of seating to just relax. Wish they would've had bar located there. We are smokers and the smoking location is in a very small spot on third floor between the two pools kind of a pain in the butt. There was always at least 7 smokers there and only four chairs.

Overall this property is very good but it has some quirks you need to be aware of up front. Lets discuss the really good parts first. The location is very fine, right on the beach (well across the street and as close as you can get anyway), and away from the heavy newer downtown Waikiki hustle and bustle. Rooms while showing a little age, are well appointed and in general have good views with balconies. The food - as is typical with any major chain - is quite good but grossly overpriced. That's not really a negative statement, its just the way it is everywhere. Service was friendly and good. Now for the things that might not be really bad, but fall in the category of need to know. First, this hotel calls itself a resort (which in my book, it really isn't - its just a large hotel) and by doing so can legally, but rather unethically, charge a resort fee for items that should be included and are not worth the up-charge. Hotels like to do this in order to show a more competitive rate when you are comparison shopping, but then add on charges that drive the nightly rate up. In this case it is $30 a night. You will get very little for that charge especially if you are an elite member with Marriott as most of it you get free anyway. Also they don't treat elite members very well relative to regular hotels. For example you will only get a coupon for a complementary breakfast for one person a day so if you are traveling as a couple you are being conned into spending $30 for a breakfast which you can get for about $7 right next door. Kind of makes the coupons useless. I could go on about this, but you get the point. Of course if the nightly rate was quoted in total, like it should be, they might not get as much business. Kinda sad really. Just be aware that some of the policies here are a little on the questionable side. If you're fine with that then knock yourself out, it really is a nice place in a great location.","Atlanta, Georgia","RC30319</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",318,4.0

In addition, the resort has a variety of restaurants to satisfy your appetite. I mean, you can find any type of food you're looking for, including a variety of native Hawaiian dishes, without having to leave the hotel. I also enjoyed the 2 pools. If one was too crowded, there was always room at the other one. If you stay at this hotel, you have to try the breakfast buffet at the Kuhio Beach Grill. This restaurant has a variety of dishes to choose from, and the best part is that you can enjoy your breakfast while admiring the beauty of Waikiki Beach. I also enjoyed my hotel room which was very comfortable. In fact, since I was staying for 2 weeks, I was able to arrange to have a microwave oven in my hotel room at a very reasonable price. If you stay at this hotel, please try to stay in one of the rooms overlooking Waikiki Beach. This way you can enjoy the breathtaking sunrises each morning.

While the hotel, like most Marriott's, is a solid choice, don't expect any benefits with elite status.Pros:Excellent Location - The hotel is right across the street from the beach, and the beach has wave breaks making it very friendly for small kids. Where the breaks open up to the open ocean there are some fun snorkeling spots with a variety of colorful fish. Its no Hanauma bay, but for being 2 minutes from the hotel, its a pretty good spotDining - dk Steakhouse and Sensai sushi were both good options, with dk Steakhouse being the best meal we had while we were there. Service was excellent, although my one complaint was that they didn't open up outside dining despite perfect weather.Rooms - Clean, standard, Marriott rooms. The patios were nice with views of the mountains or beach depending on what side your room faces.Hospitality Room - If you need to check out but still want to have fun before your flight out, you can store your suitcase and then get cleaned up using the hospitality suite for no charge. This is an excellent selling point that made it easier for me to enjoy the rest of my day after checking out.Cons - No Elite Status Recognition - You have a dedicated elite status line, but don't expect anything after that. No free breakfast, no late check out, no rooms upgrades. As a gold elite I was hoping to get a better room at least, but instead was given a low-floor room overlooking the pool that kept me up with live music. Note, if you're still on mainland time, request a room away from the pool or on a higher floor. My colleague who has no status was upgraded to a suite, so I have no idea how they decide who to upgrade. I would stay here again, but if the price was the same I would stay at the Hilton Waikiki Village, as they provide free breakfast to golds.

We were on the 8th floor of the Kapiolani Tower close to the restaurants and shops and just across the street from Waikiki Beach. The room decor was acceptable and the rooms are equipped with flat screen tvs and a refrigerator. We traveled with two small kids (6 & 3) so it was great to run down to the ABC store on the property to get easy breakfast for them, like fruit, cereal, yogurts and milk. It saved us on food costs for our picky eaters. The balconies were great, on our side they overlooked a busy street which was fun for people-watching (we saw a couple of brides during our stay) and there is a beautiful water view. The one caveat about the big balconies is that there is quite a bit of noise at night from a nearby hotel and their live music. We did not have any problems sleeping with the noise (we brought our white noise machine for the kids) but my mother who was in the next room did struggle a bit. However, it all comes with the territory in Waikiki, it's a busy area with a lot of nightlife. Staff was fantastic. From the valet staff to the reception desk and the housekeeping staff was friendly and extremely professional. The resort fee is high but it includes a daily free coffee and mai tai, fitness classes and wi-fi. The valet is also expensive so when I stay again I would likely just rent a car from their on-site Enterprise instead of getting one at the airport for the whole trip.

We had some special requests for our stay & the staff went out of their way to accommodate us in every way. The building and furnishings however are tired and out of date. We had a corner suite -- I.e., a very nice and rather expensive premium room. The furniture all looks 30 years old, and the door jams were scuffed and needed paint. The carpet appears a bit tired as well. The structure is what it is, but the decor could be warmer.The lobby in particular is stuffy and very loud. Some sound baffling or use of soft surfaces would go a long way in defeating the noise bouncing off all the hard surfaces there: walls, ceilings, floors. Traffic noise intrudes from the open area to the street, but the breeze only seems to move in one direction through the lobby, and the actual check in desk area feels stifling.The arrangement of amenities is also a bit inconvenient. For example, the very well-appointed fitness room is difficult to find, because there are no signs or directory listings to tell guests where it is or how to get there. This is in stark contrast to the directory listings, signs with arrows, and televised advertisements in the elevators for the hotel's restaurants.There is also an expansive, disorganized space between the two swimming pools, with a sort of path laid out between them using potted plants. One wonders what if any use that space might once have had. Walking through it conveys a sense of loneliness and decay.All of this is somewhat tragic, because the location is spectacular, the restaurants are decent, and the staff is terrific.If we have occasion to stay in Waikiki in the future, we will probably stay in another venue.","Manila, Philippines","Sam M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",71,3.0

The view is absolutely gorgeous with beautiful view of the Waikiki beach.. The rooms are clean and the housekeeping staffs are also very friendly.  One thing you will want to keep an eye for is if your room type comes with free breakfast or not. I thought my package came with free breakfast so we went down to the breakfast buffet on our first morning, showed the host our room key and asked if this is where we go for the compementry breakfast with our room. The host said yes and walked us to our table. Half way through our meal ( with food still in my mouth) another staff came by and told us that our room actually doesn't come with free breakfast and that I would have to pay. Humiliated, as everyone around us heard and it sounded like we sneaked in to steal food, all I could do was nodd and say ok. That was the worst part of my stay and really the only complaint I have with the hotel. Although they did ended up refunding me the charge for the meal after speaking the the restaurant manager and explaining what happened, I think they should of checked my room package first or at the very least try to not make a scene and embarrass their guest.Aside from that little hiccup, this hotel is amazing.

We had the ocean view room and were able to view the Friday night fireworks (from the Hilton) from our balcony which was a good size for a couple of people. The staff was very nice and would always greet us when walking by. They even went out of their way to work with my boyfriend on setting up something special in our room for me which made my trip that much better. All the good restaurants are within walking distance.

First of all, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. From the moment that you pull up to the hotel, the staff warmly greets you - in our case the parking attendants, then they guided ,us to the check in area. Check in went extremely fast, information provided was informative and efficient, and we were quickly on our way. This is a big hotel, so one can get lost the first day or so, since there are two separate towers and multiple restaurants and lounges (and shopping vendors). We were provided an upgraded room that had a wonderful balcony view looking out over the ocean and beach. Great view. The room had a refrigerator, the internet worked great, etc. Here were a few ""challenges"": the bathroom has a sink area outside of the toilet/bath area which is nice, however if you have to use the toilet and need to turn on the light, the lights in both the toilet/bath area and the sink area come on, lighting up the entire room. Within the bath/shower, some of the fixtures were coming apart from use and from age. Air circulation was a bit of an issue in the room. We set the temperature lower when we wanted to go to sleep, but very little cool air came forth from the AC and the temperature really never lowered much. Without a ceiling fan, the lack of air circulation had us waking up uncomfortably hot a few times each night. Also, we had a lot of light coming into the room (even with the curtains pulled) from the vending rooms. This was kind of strange, but the way that the towers are situated (kind of an L shape) other rooms were at right angles to us, so when we opened our curtains to the balcony, there were others in rooms kind of staring right at us. Between our room and the others were the vending machine rooms all lit up on every floor. A positive - the breakfast. Fantastic breakfast with a great staff of servers. Friendly, attentive, what a great way to start a day. The breakfast is not cheap, so check the cost. When we checked in, as Marriott Gold members (both my wife and I), we were only afforded one breakfast coupon per room per day, and there is no concierge lounge offered to members. Just something to take into account when considering this property versus all other Marriott hotels, etc.","Alexandria, Virginia","Joseph A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia</strong>",45,4.0

Two very different but pleasing experiences. First impression is how large and busy the hotel is, with people all around the reception area. Yet we were greeted promptly and had access to our room a few hours early. Reception staff were welcoming and helpful throughout our stay, suggesting restaurants and tips for exploring. Servers in the pool area and steakhouse were also friendly and made us feel right at home. Self-parking is expensive but easy since it is right in the building. The concierge desk (2 people; sometimes only one) was always busy and wait times were long so that may be an area for more support. Our room was surprisingly large and clean but double beds (vs. queen in Maui and most Marriotts we've been to) just do not cut it at a resort in this day and age. It definitely does not reflect a higher-end 'resort' experience. Bathroom area was smaller than expected though adequate. Pool was large and lovely with plenty of chairs though not much shade options. I was concerned being across the street from the beach but that was not an issue at all. Hotel is well located with access to many restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. As long-time Honored Guest members we requested and were told we received an upgrade on the ocean-view room we had booked. But was not sure what the improvement was since we still had an ocean-view room though balcony was a decent size to fit two chairs, a chaise and a table with a ok, though sideways, view of the beach. As always, Marriott dependably delivers on a very good vacation experience, but it was short of the outstanding one that seems to go along with the splurge on a Hawaiian holiday.","Long Island, New York","GoCB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island, New York</strong>",36,4.0

Compared to other resort areas on Oahu and other islands, this is the place that resembles the most well established metropolitan areas. There are shops, restaurants, hotels, one-way streets, and lots of people. So depending on your preference, this could be a place for you. It is one street away from the beach, next to the zoo, within hiking distance to Diamond Head, and easily connected to major motorways to go to places. There is an ABC store (as in anywhere in town) onsite, and plenty of restaurants in the hotel. The room is clean, and with essential amenities.A couple of downsides. The swimming pool is a bit small, and the grade from 3 to 8 feet is pretty steep, definitely scary for small children or beginner swimmers. Guess it is not meant to attract people to stay there for long. Next, there was a rude lady at the concierge desk - when my wife asked her about suggestion of local restaurants, she blankly pointed to sections in a brochure and asked my wife to read by herself, without showing any professional courtesy or enthusiasm in helping a hotel guest. Maybe just an outlier in an otherwise friendly staff, but thought to point this out and hope improvement could be made.Overall we had a good time here, and would recommend this hotel to anyone.","Beijing, China","starkid0816</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beijing, China</strong>",8,5.0

This hotel is a very, very short walk across the street to the best part of the beach in Waikiki. The hotel is also very close to the Honolulu Zoo and aquarium, which is convenient. The hotel is large, occupying an entire city block, with two tall towers of hotel rooms and plenty of stores and restaurants on the ground level. The pool and yet more restaurants are on the second and third floors. Bottom line: There’s plenty to love about the location of this hotel for easy access to the beach, highway (H1), and attractions. The hotel rooms are good quality Marriott-quality rooms. The in-room refrigerator is a nice feature. The view from my upgraded room was nice but not exceptional. (Photos uploaded.) The bed was comfortable with feather pillows, one of which held an odor from prior guests. The in-room desk and Wi-Fi made getting work accomplished easy.

The fruit was as fresh and delicious as you’d expect. The omelet bar chef was exceptionally friendly. All of the food was yummy.

It’s worth checking beforehand.The property itself is dated. This is more noticeable in some places than others, like the parking garage. The garage elevator broke during my visit, which forced me into the stairwell a few times. Ugh.

The customer service was exceptional, from the managers, Jesse, Stephen, and Chi, to the workers at the hotel. The staff went above and beyond to accommodate our wishes. We stayed in a Junior Suite with wonderful windows on multiple sides. The decor is fairly minimal in nature, but it was very tasteful, and didn't feel old or worn out in any way (and we are hotel snobs). The ABC store on the ground level was super helpful for anything that we might need during our stay, including drinks/food/souvenirs/water toys. The location of the hotel is perfect if you have small kids. The location is across the street from the beach (but it takes 2 seconds to get there), and there is a rock wall about 20 yards into the ocean. The beautiful part about the rock wall is that you don't have to worry about the waves being too much for the kids to handle. It is super calm, beautiful water, in front of the wall, and there are umbrellas to rent there ($25/hour or so) for shade. Lots of room in the water... we never felt crowded, and we were there in high season. One of the nice features of the resort fee that we paid was unlimited dvd rentals. All the rooms have dvd players. We used this multiple times at night with the kids. Cool idea! There is an Enterprise Car Rental location in the lobby, which I used and was super convenient, although expensive per day, compared to the lower 48 state car rental places. $75/day for an Economy car. The breakfast buffet was very good too. All in all, a great stay. We debated the Hilton (not the Village), but the Hilton was a block farther away from the ocean, and we wanted to be closer to the water. One nice touch I might suggest for the hotel, is that for a lot of nice properties in the Caribbean, they offer guests a glass of champagne and a wet wash cloth for refreshment upon arrival. I know this property is not an all-inclusive, but it would be a great touch :) Tiki's is next door (great food/drinks), and it is a short walk to Duke's Waikiki/main shopping downtown as well.

Within two hours, we knew we had made a big mistake.The good --The front desk staff was awesome, really a great check in process, very accommodating and very helpful.-Good view of Waikiki beach if you are into that and willing to pay up for the room.-Very good breakfast buffet (skip the scrambled eggs) and be ok with spending $32 pp if you do not get vouchers.So why did we check out after one night?-The pool was wall to wall people and a joke in size for a place like this.-The pool bar food, was the worst we have ever experienced at a hotel. -Too loud outside even from the 23rd floor-Dated interior-Balcony that basically is as private as a subway car at rush hour -THE BEACH IS ACROSS THE STREET! I somehow missed that bit when reading reviews here. Thankfully the awesome staff allowed us to ditch one of the days without penalty so we could stay at the Courtyard North Shore where the real Hawaii is and used less than half the points to boot. Oh and paid $10 for parking vs 37 (you do get valet for that.If you are looking for the city experience with some gorgeous (but crowded) water, with lots of people and unnatural sounds this place is for you.

The hotel has two towers with a number of restaurants and cafes at the ground floor of the property.Starting from my check-in experience where it quite literally took me 30 minutes standing at the front-desk, we were allocated a room that faced Waikiki Beach and it was located right next to the lift well and to be honest, it was borderline annoying with the constant hum of the lifts going up and down during the day and most part of the night. Compared to another five star resort I stayed at Waikiki Beach the two nights before, the room was quite small and the toilet had a smell to it. The balcony door also does not close fully with a slightly gap. Then also comes the resort fees of the hotel which was approximately US$31 a day. Being a frequent traveler, I don't quite understand why the hotel charges resort fees for services which I believe should have been included in room charges already.However, although there are a few negatives, the positives for me was that I was allowed early check-in and the hotel itself is located right next to Waikiki Beach. Food choices are plentiful and plenty of activities to do.","Melbourne, Australia","alim85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",39,3.0

Not only were we not early, we did not get in until after the scheduled check in time of 3pm. The room literally smelled of urine, forcing us to buy air fresheners. We hesitated in reporting the smell because we didn't want to lose the spectacular view since we were only staying three nights but it was so overwhelming, even after our air fresheners, we ultimately did report it to the front desk. They had the head of housekeeping apply a treatment but at the end of the day the smell remained. When we went to order room service, the room did not have a menu and they had to bring us one. The bed/mattress was old and had lost all support. The hot tub was a bathtub for little children. Most places restrict children in the hot tub for their safety. Not here. Generally, the hotel was outdated, top to bottom. Shower was small, carpet worn, etc.I have come to expect so much more from Marriott.

We walked in the lobby to water leaking from the second floor down onto the lobby floor. When we finally got into our room (the room we booked was not available), the sofa was so worn and dirty looking, we would not sit on it. The carpet had long holes in it. We did not want to walk around barefoot in the room. It also took two people to open the sliding door to get out on the balcony. We spend hundreds of nights a year in hotels and usually they are Marriotts. This hotel left much to be desired. I just don't want people spending their hard earned money on a once in a lifetime vacation to find themselves in a dirty dingy room that needs updating. I was there mostly on business, so I can live with a crummy room from time to time.

Because I'm not very familiar with the area, I figured it was safest to stay at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort. My other option was the Courtyard which didn't have fabulous reviews and isn't at the beach. I'll probably review that another time...So back to this hotel. I arrived late on a Tuesday night and had checked in online. My keys were ready and I didn't have any problem just picking them up and heading to my room. The lobby is gorgeous. Apparently it was recently remodeled. I was informed via email I got an upgrade so I was disappointed when I got to my room and it had 2 double beds (my preference in my profile is for a king). I called and they informed me they had no kings. Oh well. I guess the upgrade was for my ocean view. The mattress was a little saggy and the furnishings were pretty dated. I did like the fact that I had a balcony that was in the sun in the afternoon that had a table, two chairs and a chaise.There is no breakfast benefit for elite members at this property because it is a ""resort"" but everyone gets charged a resort fee of $30/d that includes breakfast (for ONE) in the Kuhio Grill. I suppose it was fine. Typical breakfast buffet with local, American and Asian options. Again, seemed to have a very dated appearance.They also give you 2 drink tickets for use at the Kuhio Grill or bar by the pool. Beware. The print is very small. At first glance you will think the ticket is good for Mai Tais but that is incorrect. Order a Mai Tai and you will pay. It is for ""Mai Tai punch"" - be sure you show them your ticket so you order the right (free) drink (which isn't even listed on the menu, BTW).The pool is open until 11 so if you have a room facing the pool, be ready to keep your balcony door closed if you want to sleep before 11 (the bar was also visible/audible from my room).As I mentioned, I was there for work. I requested a late check out on Friday but it was not available. I had to work until the afternoon but my flight wasn't until 8:30 so I was hoping to spend a couple hours relaxing by the pool. They told me to leave my bags with the bellman when I went to work, and after I was done at the pool I should ask the bellman to make me a key for the ""hospitality room"" which was a place I could shower before heading to the airport. They specifically said to ask the bellman so I didn't need to wait on line (there was always a line at the registration desk - even at the elite counter). When I finished at the pool and asked the bellman he said he couldn't do it. Oh well. So I got a hospitality room key from the registration desk, took my bags and headed up to he hospitality room. I opened the door and was shocked to see a couple with a little girl in the room - they informed me it was a shared room (would have been nice if the staff had told me that - I thought I had barged in on them). The room was a converted hotel room that had had 3 beds before (I know this because there were still 3 headboards on the wall). There was a tiny odd sofa in one corner of the room, 2 bathrooms (a handicapped and a regular one) and a giant stack of towels in one corner. I wonder how often folks come to clean the room - it was filthy - trash everywhere, used towels everywhere. About 5 opened soaps in every location possible in the bathroom. I cleaned the bathroom/shower so I felt comfortable using it - this included picking up about 10 towels so I could put my things on a counter and make my way to to shower. There were a plenty of bottles of shampoo and conditioner on the counter which was good. I suggest they just put some dispensers in the showers which would cut down on the trash and wasted soap.After my shower I had about 30 min until I had to leave for the airport and I still had those drink tickets since I had to pay for the earlier Mai Tai incident, so I decided to watch the sun set at the bar. This time, all the wiser, I decided to show my bartender the tickets in advance. He told me I could have one of 4 draft beers or a Mai Tai punch. I was pleasantly surprised - they had Bikini Blond on draft. So I enjoyed a few beers and good service before I left. At least it ended on an up note.

They are only 2 blocks away from each and each had its merits.What we liked about the Marriott:- The location can't be beat! It is directly across the street from the beach and the pier. The portion of the beach that is across from the hotel has a sea wall that breaks the waves and keeps it fairly safe for the kiddies to swim. - The staff were super helpful and friendly. We even got a free upgrade to a bigger room with an ocean view when we checked in. The woman also gave us a huge stack of free coffee cards.- The hotel is modern, clean, and appears to be newly renovated. The room was comparable to most other high end resort hotels. The beds were comfortable, the air conditioner worked well, there was a fridge, plenty of shampoo, coffee, etc were supplied, and the balcony was huge. -There are activities offered in the lobby every morning. We got to make and keep a real flower lei, a ribbon lei, and learn how to hula. -It is a large hotel with many shops on site, several restaurants, a gym, pool, etc that are open early and late. This was not the case with the Aston Sunset. -The pool was right beside the restaurant/ bar so there was a band to serve as entertainment while swimming in the evenings. Also, the kids could have a swim while adults have a drink while keeping an eye on the kids. The bar also overlooks the beach so there is a great view of the fantastic sunsets if one isn't lucky enough to have an ocean view bedroom.- The lobby was large, open air, and a comfortable place to lounge. - There was free wifi that worked without issue in the rooms and in the lobby.-There was a convenience room to store our luggage when we checked out but didn't have a flight until that evening. Areas for improvement:- The bathroom, although clean and up to date, was fairly small-The beds were only doubles. They could easily fit at least one queen sized bed in the rooms with one double instead. Two grown adults squished into a double bed did not make for a good sleep. -The pool was quite busy. It could be made a little bigger to accommodate all of the people. -There is a $30/ day resort fee that isn't included at the time of booking. It covers use of the internet, daily activities, a free dvd rental, etc. The fee should just be included in the price of the room at the time of booking so there are no hidden surprise costs.",Alberta,"kmomma</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alberta</strong>",53,4.0

Even though check in is at 4pm, we checked in with the mobile app for 2pm. Upon arrival, which was 12pm, we valeted and checked in very quickly. They had both of our rooms ready for us, even coming in 2 hrs earlier than our moved up check in time. The resort is located on the southern end of Waikiki Beach, so it is far to walk with a baby in stroller and mom with knee issues to Moana Surfrider or Outrigger. We ate at Dukes. We got connecting rooms but it takes a key to open the door to connect them. We did call down to the desk to get the crib they forgot to put in the room, but it arrived very quickly after the phone call. The room looked updated. However, I don't know who did the work, it was done quickly and a bit ""shabby"". The outlets were not square or even, they were in an angle. And the bathroom had too much, free space. the other bathroom did not have a door to the bathroom. The room was quite quiet. We didn't hear others and they didn't hear our baby cry at night. We did have ""partial ocean view"" but that was only by opening up the patio and leaning over to see the ocean. Had coffee breakfast at Seattles Best. They did give us free breakfast coupon that we didn't use. Also free coupons for 2 Mai Tais and unlimited DVD rentals. This may or may not have to do with Gold Status. Always had fresh water by the lobby area. Lobby area sitting areas were very comfortable and relaxing. Don't forget to call 10 min ahead for valet.

After arriving on an early morning flight we were hopeful of getting into our room sooner than later. This was not the case but Richard at reception was extremely helpful and we were greatly appreciative of our spacious King room in the front tower with wonderful ocean views. Level 11 was perfect with a spacious balcony which had a lounger, two chairs and a table.I could not speak too highly of the staff when we had breakfast - especially the beautiful hostess. The buffet breakfast was very good. The location of the hotel is at the opposite end of the beach to the historic Royal Hawaiian but really only a short walk to enjoy sunset drinks at some of the other hotels on the beach. We preferred the beach directly out from the Marriott as it was not so 'touristy'.We loved the location, size of the room and balcony however the pool is small.

I was really excited to try this property out for our 8 night work/pleasure stay. There are 2 towers to this property. Beware - The Tower closet to Kuhio - The rooms are run down and dire need of a refresh. The Tower directly facing the beach - The rooms were larger and have been refreshed. I had a room in both towers.Check in - No long Queues, no mention of amenities/breakfast as a Gold Member. Was told it was not included unless we purchased the resort fee. Was told our corporate rate doesn't have a resort fee. Ok, fine, but Golds still get benefits in the absence of resort fees. For example - Breakfast. I was ready to surrender, my husband asked to speak to a supervisor/manager. Stephen did confirm that 1 breakfast was included as a gold. That's right, 1 not 2. Ok fine, do we get a coupon or anything to give at breakfast? No, just give them your room number and it will be adjusted on the back end.One big plus - We arrived very early - 12 pm, and we were offered a room right away. This was greatly appreciated. The bad part, back tower, 4th floor. Stephen was able to secure a room a little higher up 10th floor. We were also put on a list and offered to move to a better room in the front tower in 2 nights.10th Floor Room - Back Tower King Room - Small, old, dated furniture, small vanity with limited storage to put any toiletries because the modern (sarcastic) coffee making facilities on a try, took up more than a quarter of the counter space. I really can't find a lot of positives to say other than it was clean. My husband immediately asked for more hangers and some bath robes. We were told they should be in our room after dinner. Needless to say, over 24 hours later, nothing. When leaving for work in the am, our room was the only one that appeared to have no newspaper. Breakfast - In temporary ballroom location while main restaurant gets renovated. Very satisfactory with a wide variety of offerings including an omelette/egg station. The service staff are wonderful. I asked for the check, the waitress asked if I had a coupon. I said no, it is included, I was told just to sign for it and it would be adjusted on the back end. She said that I should have got a coupon. Down to the front desk I went to make sure to get this settled as the breakfast here is not cheap - I believe $28.00. I spoke to the agent about my breakfast concern and re-stating what Stephen had told me the day prior only for her to tell me, I don't get breakfast. This was just exhausting to say the least. How can there be this much inconsistency with staff as to what's included for a Gold vs. Resort Fees. After looking on her computer, she said, - Yes I see you do get breakfast and if that's what Stephen told you to do, keep doing. Needless to say, the night before check out, my husband went to review the bill downstairs, and breakfast was charged every day! Stephen was actually on duty and settled it, but this is not acceptable.Front tower - King Room - Two nights into the stay, we moved to the front tower. What a difference. The room was big, modern, and the view was probably the best I've seen from a hotel in Waikiki. It was well worth the move. The balconies are also larger and have a full lounger.Pools/Gym - I have no complaints, yes the pool are a little small given the # of rooms the property has, but the facilities are far superior to the Hilton and Hyatt.The Gym is probably one of the best I've seen in a while.WiFi - Superior to other properties, doesn't require daily/frequent log in's like other properties.Big Plus is having ABC store right on the property. Also pay attention to your poolside bar bill. Sitting at the bar - My husband was charged for a large draft beer and clearly had a small one - His cup was still full when he brought it to a servers attention. This could be a one off, but perception is everything - The bar tenders reaction made me feel like this happens a lot.I'm on the fence if I would stay here again. I get that this is a ""Resort"" but these resort fees really dilute the benefits of top tier member should get.

I am a Marriott Gold member and was incredibly disappointed in this hotel. I stay in Marriotts frequently and can honestly say that this is the first time I have ever been this disappointed in a hotel carrying the Marriott brand. The only reason I rated this hotel ""poor"" instead of ""terrible"" is because of the location but the hotel leaves much to be desired. First, the hotel does NOT have a concierge floor. Instead they offer you ONE breakfast buffet per room per day. If your traveling companion is hungry in the morning they can pay $28.95 plus tax and tip for a $10 buffet with poor service. Service at the restaurant overlooking the beach is deplorable. It took us an hour and 40 minutes, yes 100 minutes to eat lunch there. It is a good thing we did not have anywhere else to be.The walls in the hotel are paper thin. You can hear EVERYTHING in the rooms on either side. And the hotel only has ice machines on even floors so if you want ice and are on an odd numbered floor you need to take the very slow elevator to the ice machines. After this Marriott stay I am seriously thinking about switching to Westin as my preferred hotel brand.

Upon checking in, the girl that assisted us looked as if they twisted her arm and forced her to work the front desk...far from welcoming. Second, a day before checking out, I went down to the front desk to see if I could get a portion of my bill slit since a couple of day of my vacation were actually work days (something I was told could be done prior to arriving), and the girl working this time, had the same attitude and told me that could not be done. I then asked to speak with a supervisor and a guy named ""Stephen"" came out who came out raising his voice without even trying to hear what my concern was. That whole front desk crew needs to be taught some serious customer service skills!!!!The hotel was nothing more than a basic hotel that you would stay in within your local city. It didn't even look as if we were in Hawaii until we walked outside the hotel. The rooms are dingy looking, and if you're staying here for multiple days...you'll have to call housekeeping to request your sheets be changed.

I decided to stay at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Resort & Spa for a week at the end of May and I am very glad I chose this hotel. The property is located on the eastern edge of Waikiki beach right on the main strip (Kalakaua Ave). It is only a 5-10 minute walk West to get to the heart of Waikiki. Because of the location, I feel that it is a little quieter at night because it is slightly away from all the action (which I prefer). The Honolulu Zoo is minutes away from the property and walking to the Rainbow Drive-In or Leonard's Bakery is very doable. I was able to walk to Rainbow Drive-In in less than 10 minutes and Leonard's in about 20 minutes (I was doing some window shopping at the same time)The Waikiki Beach Marriott also has 2 Seattles Best Coffee stands within the property and an ABC store for your snacks, drinks and last minute souvenirs. The Honolulu Cookie Company is only steps away from the property as well as other shopping. I was lucky enough to have gotten a room on the 23rd floor and the room had an awesome view (westward) of Waikiki Beach. I often turned off the AC and had the balcony doors wide open to get that nice sea breeze and be able to hear the surf. Although this hotel is not directly on the beach, it is only a quick street crossing away.

From our balcony in room 2204, our view of the sweep of beautiful Waikiki beach, and a Pacific Ocean that seemed to go on forever, was simply breathtaking. Our huge, well-appointed room with king-size bed was lovely, though lacking somewhat in regard to the bathroom size and layout. From check-in to check-out, the people providing services were wonderfully nice and quite cheerful. Everything we needed was provided promptly and with a smile. The buffet breakfasts offered were a big plus, being both of wide variety and high quality. The pools were lovely, and there was a nice pool-side bar.This remodeled and expanded vintage hotel is stately, with fine internal shopping, spa and health units, two pools and multiple dining facilities. Some renovation was in progress during our stay in late May/ early June 2016, so changes are in store. One negative was the absence of facilities in the large lobby, particularly a place to eat or a bar. Another was one instance of a stand-in concierge who was only moderately competent. These are only minor things and, as a whole, this hotel is a fine place to stay, and priced in line with other nearby establishments.","Indianapolis, Indiana","Mike R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Indianapolis, Indiana</strong>",5,4.0

I am not speaking of the location of the hotel itself, but rather the location WITHIN the hotel. I booked a partial ocean view, which I assumed was a nice view that I could look out and see the ocean partially from the balcony. Being assigned room 605 (a lower floor), my view out of one window was a beautiful parking lot at eye level (I am being sarcastic) and the view of a green roof of a church out of the balcony window. If I propped myself in the corner of the balcony, I could see a bit of the ocean. After making a major complaint, in the late afternoon I was transferred to a higher floor room which had a much better partial ocean view. I also recommend that you request the FRONT towers which are literally a block closer to the ocean than the towers on Kuhio.

The lobby is big, bright, and airy, and has a second ""tour lobby"" where tour buses pick up and drop off all day. Check-in was a breeze, and the staff were welcoming. The room itself was incredibly spacious and bright, with a balcony overlooking Waikiki Beach. The hotel has a few restaurant options, including family friendly poolside dining (also overlooking the beach) and a nicer restaurant on the same level. Breakfast, often a cramped and overlooked affair in hotels, was served in a ballroom and had a variety of US mainland standard dishes (eggs, potatoes, waffles) as well as item influenced by Hawaii (coconut syrup!) and the east (salmon, rice). It was a great way to start the day. The hotel also has an ABC store with everything from snacks to sundresses, and also has other clothing and jewelry stores, coffee shops, and restaurants just outside the lobby. The hotel's location is in Waikiki, so it's busy and near other restaurants, bars, and shopping, but it's also within walking distance of Diamondhead Crater Park and it's an easy drive (or tour bus ride) to Pearl Harbor and other scenic destinations (North Shore, waterfalls, etc). It's across the street from a great swimming, protected swimming spot, with surfing and paddle boarding just outside the jetty/sea wall. The only reason I didn't give the hotel a five was that there are fairly high fees, including a $30/night resort fee, for which you receive coupons for some free coffee, video rentals, and two free drinks, and also a hefty valet parking fee. There is an enterprise on site, so, depending on how much driving you plan to do, it might be cheaper to rent a car at the hotel than to rent one at the airport and then pay to park at the hotel.

The toilet seat was wobbled and extremely stained ( see image) I would like to go into detail about the issues I have with this but I just ate dinner and so I'm going to leave it at, the seat is stained and has the indentation of plastic that has been burned by a very hot instrument.

It's down the road from the high-end shopping, which turned out to be a huge plus. While still easily walkable should you want to shop, being a little removed meant fewer tourists making it impossible to get anywhere. 2 pools which were both pretty quiet, a delicious (and expansive) breakfast buffet (that opens at 5 a.m., presumably to accommodate those of us stuck on Eastern Time/who want to hit the beach early), and a nice gym. They also had a lobby entrance specifically for tour groups, and the Marriott seemed to be a pickup on a lot of routes - really convenient!

The most uncomfortable thing was the partial ocean view balcony. We stayed on the 11th floor, and unfortunately there is a weird sound chamber that bounces off the hotel across the street making sitting on the balcony VERY loud. It was a constant cacophony of whining bus engines, trucks backing up, garbage trucks collecting dumpsters, tour trollies ringing their bells to let the riders know they were pulling up, and just a litany of street noises that probably wouldn't be noticeable at that height if the sounds weren't bouncing off the adjacent hotel. The location is great - right across the street from the beach and in the middle of the Waikiki strip. There is plenty of shopping in the hotel and the prices are very reasonable. Unless you have some kind of package deal for meals, you probably won't eat in the hotel much. Both breakfast and dinner are buffet only and priced on the high side. If you're an ""all you can eat"" kind of person, that likes the gravy and sauce laden dinners on the buffet line, then it might be a good deal for you. Personally, my wife and I were too eager to try as many local places as possible.The hotel is on the south side of the Island, and its only an hour to drive to the complete opposite side (north side) of eth island which was where we went to visit the botanical garden. Along the way we passed the Dole plantation and Pearl Harbor, so even with 10 days, there is plenty to do and see other than just soaking up beach sand and sun.Over all the hotel was fine. It was certainly clean and well kept, and again, the staff was wonderful. It's only a short 25 minute drive from the airport, a few miles from Diamond Head National Monument (park - defunct volcano), and steps from the beach.The stores are a mix of standard resort stores with clothes and high end souvenirs, but they also have a Seattle's Best coffee shop (for an extra $1 ask for the 100 percent Kona), spa like stores that sell lotions and oils, and they have 2 ABC stores that are like souped-up convenience stores that sell everything from T-shirts, to liquor, and everything in between.Finally, the $30 per day resort fee is a bit of a racket, but I suspect that it's standard practice for all of the hotels there and is expected with the name ""resort"", but honestly you don't really get anything above and beyond what you would get at any other Marriott hotel with the exception of a pool that's outside instead of inside, which we never used anyway. If the indoor shops qualify as ""resort amenities"" then maybe hotel guests should receive a discount because the shop owners aren't renting those stores for free as a convenience to the guests, I'm sure they are paying a very competitive rent.While Waikiki, Honolulu and Hawaii are absolutely gorgeous, and my wife and I will definitely go back (and we live on the east coast), we would try another hotel next time. We're certainly not sorry we stayed there, but if we were to return, there's nothing drawing us back to that property. I happen to be a rewards member of Marriott as well as a Diamond member at Hilton, and as a retired veteran, I can also stay at the Armed Forces Recreation Center hotel that is at the end of Waikiki beach, so I have other choices not based solely on price or availability.Oh - forgot to mention - the WiFi is free and excellent. Great reception, great bandwidth, a real pleasure. Made uploading all of my pictures a breeze.Hope this helps - enjoy.",,Louis C,3,3.0

We made the original booking as a fall back position looking for a deal in Ko Olina that never eventuated, Easter, who would have guessed! Anyway, to the review, Mariotts are Marriotts so the quality of the property will be good and the Waikiki Marriott is no exception even if it is somewhat design dated. Being a bit picky small things like ice on every second floor, crowded lifts and undersized pools that are OK for the kids but not for an adult to relax are more a frustration than anything else and reflect its era.The property is located at the Diamond Head end of the major resort area so its a bit of a hike to the most popular beach areas. Our ocean view was OK but it appeared most, including ours, came from the side of the building with a 30 degree water view. Service was pretty good outside of the peak times.So why the title of this review?

The first time we were guaranteed a king size bed in writing but didn't get it until I came down after our first night and showed my confirmation email which did, in fact, say that we had a king size bed room. They found a king size bed room and we changed rooms. I wrote a trip advisor review, and, which I really did appreciate, the hotel manager wrote us a response saying to ask for him next time to insure that we didn't have a problem. So, last month, I called ahead and reserved a king size bed, which the telephone reservations agent processed and sent us a confirmation - saying that we'd have either a king bed room or a two bed room. If they told me that on the phone, I would have reserved somewhere else or called the manager. We get to the hotel and, sure enough, no king beds. I told them about my message from the manager and they upgraded us to a family suite, which we really liked. I have nothing but praise for all of the hotel staff, especially because they accommodated us but am I really going to have to go through this everytime to get a king sized room? Here's something else, the people checking in with us got a king size room, which they had requested by room number. We love Marriott properties are second tier up Marriott Rewards members.

The property was clean and well kept; with a particularly lovely (and tropical feeling) Pool Area. The gym was better than would typically be expected at a resort property, and the rooms although needing a refresh; were nicely appointed. I have to call out Lisa Wong and her friendly front desk staff; who went a step or two beyond to ensure that we got an upgrade with a nice view. Thanks much for the friendly extra attention; it goes a long way to making this road warrior feel at home; particularly after an airline caused 5 hour delay in arrival.The location although across from Waikiki beach was close enough to where this wasn't a deterrent but rather a benefit.

We first stayed in this hotel on our honeymoon when it was called the Hawaiian Regent back in 1980, so we've been here a lot. We love the location because it's at the more quiet end of the strip, right near the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and park. A lot less people then center strip. They have 2 towers, I recommend staying in the tower closest to the beach (front) with a room facing west. It gives you a great view of Waikiki beach and the sun setting.The place has 2 salt water pools, one for each tower, but you can use either or. We prefer the pool in the front tower because it has a bar and servers to bring you food or drink. There is some shade at the pool if you don't mind moving around as the sun moves. You can also rent a cabana for $25 and $40 per day. The pool generally isn't crowded and the servers are very attentive. If you prefer the beach, that is just across the street from the hotel.There are a few restaurants in the hotel, the one that has the buffet breakfast and dinner is temporarily located on the 3rd floor and the Moana Terrace located on the 3rd floor near the front pool. We had the buffet breakfast 4 times because we had gotten 8 coupons for free breakfast. It's regularly about $24 each, nothing special or fancy your basic breakfast, lots of fresh fruit, pastries, bacon, sausage, eggs and an omelet station. If it didn't come with the room we would not have gone there, too pricy for us for breakfast. The Moana Terrace, served great lunch and dinner finger foods, nachos, burgers, fish, etc. They also provided free entertainment in the evening under the stars. Prices were resort average $12-18, fruity drinks $12. Service was excellent and the food very tasty.Now unfortunately like many resorts are getting, they have a $30 per day resort fee. This includes some local and international calling, wifi and a few other things. Can't remember them all. Now like I mentioned we did get 8 coupons for the free buffet breakfast, 8 free cups of Seattle""s Best Coffee and the wifi, so the fee I felt was a wash and worth it. The other really cool thing that they have is FREE DVD rentals, located on the 2nd floor. This was cool, titles fairly recent, but hey it was something to do if you wanted to make it an early night. Each room has a DVD player so you can even bring your kids favorite DVD.They have a coin laundry located by the front pool and of course an exercise facility. The room we had was sparkling clean and well kept during our entire stay. It also comes with a refrigerator so you can pick up snacks at the Food Pantry (5 minute walk on Kuhio Drive) or one of the many ABC Stores.Parking is like $34 per day so unless you really really need a car every day, I would take a taxi from the airport (Charlie's Taxi $30 one way 808-233-3333) and then find a good deal car rental near the hotel rent day by day to avoid the parking charge. You can use Charlie's back to the airport as well, set up your pickup time.Would we stay here again, absolutely!!

I can always rely on Marriott mattresses and pillows for a solid, restful night.Service was outstanding, but in one respect I was quite disappointed. I had a bit of a craving for apple pie one afternoon/evening and spent about 2 hours walking all over downtown Waikiki to find apple pie, but with no luck at any of the myriad restaurants there. Finally, upon returning to the hotel, I found that apple pie a la mode was available from room service. I ordered two slices for our group, and about 20 minutes later I was wishing I had grabbed a small slice of fast food pie at the next door Burger King. For ~$36, this pie was a disappointment. I have no problem paying for quality, but this was ridiculous. The pie was average at best, and the price was ludicrous. Marriott took advantage of the ""location, location, location"" thing here, I felt. I wouldn't recommend room service--simply from that one experience.Apart from that very minor issue, the hotel was quite good.

Funnily enough our friends had checked in the day before and had received a free upgrade from a basic city view room to deluxe ocean view. I feel that as the rooms were not booked directly with the hotel, there was no responsibility taken for our bookings. I have never been faced with a similar situation where the hotel staff just simply did not care that I was unhappy with my room. The hotel is in a very convenient location. The rooms in the older tower are a bit dated and do not have much of a view. The pool area is very small and was not relaxing as it was very crowded.There is a $US 30 resort fee and it is unclear what this is for. Self parking is $US32 per day which i felt was a quite pricey.I didn't feel like it was worth the rates we paid and are certainly not going back to stay there.","Cambridge, United Kingdom","Jessica P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, United Kingdom</strong>",1,3.0

Great room except the balcony was on the side of the room and not on the oceanfront. The building looks like it was built for balconies on the front but doesn't have them. The breakfast buffet was a little expensive and hard to evaluate since it was in a temporary location due to construction but the service and food were both excellent. Parking is in the building but expensive at $32 per day for self-parking. Would recommend this hotel but know you will do a lot of walking as the hotel is one of the last hotels on Waikiki and many of the restaurants and shopping are going to be a 10-15 walk towards the rest of Waikiki.

We stopped at the concierge desk to get some information, and decided to book all of our shore excursions through Tara.

We were upgraded to a ‘Premium’ Ocean & Diamond Head View on the 23rd floor of the Kealohilani tower. In my opinion, the other side of the tower would have a better view of Waikiki as long as it was still a high floor. Had I known, I would have asked at check-in. But I'm not complaining as it was a really nice room with a large balcony and great view.As part of the $30 Resort Fee, Elite members get coupons for 1 buffet breakfast per day, not breakfast for 2 like a other Marriott's. I know it's a 'resort' but even in Paris which was more expensive than Hawaii, we got breakfast for 2. I guess it's better than nothing for the Resort Fee. We also got 2 free MaiTais and 25% off food at the Moana Terrace. Parking was steep at $32 per day. So once you tack on the taxes, resort and parking fees, it was about $100 more than the $239 room rate. BUT, for Waikiki, that was still a pretty good deal. I had initially booked the Westin Moana Surfrider, as it was $1100 for 3 nights for partial ocean view including taxes and resort fee (which includes parking). But, not being a Starwood Elite member, I didn’t think we’d get any upgrade or as good a view and I know we wouldn’t have gotten any breakfast or discounts.We had dinner at Sansei in the hotel - the sushi & tempura were excellent as was the service.Overall, an enjoyable stay in a great location.Overall, an enjoyable stay","Prescott, Arizona","AZ-LGE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Prescott, Arizona</strong>",167,4.0

Upon arrival we sat down with the concierge to schedule some activities. By mid week we began to understand that she had up-sold us on a couple of tours that did not provide the activities we were looking for. The activities themselves were fine, but we had been very clear that we wanted to see/do some very specific things. The concierge assured us that we would see/do these things in addition to the activities of the more expensive version of the activities. We told her that we wanted some free time and she assured us the activities would end with plenty of free time. However, each day we didn't get back to the hotel until late afternoon. On the last 2 days we ended up leaving the tours early and pay in excess of $50 each day for taxis to get back to the hotel and do the other things we wanted to do.I got the impression that the concierge was a contractor to the hotel and probably given incentives by the tour companies and was not especially concerned about the reflection on the Marriott brand. So my advice is buyer beware and make sure you thoroughly understand what you're getting before you spend $4,000 on activities you're not entirely interested in.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota","cgw55346</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eden Prairie, Minnesota</strong>",2,5.0

It turns out to be an excellent choice.Located just minutes away from Waikiki Beach, many of the hotel rooms have good views on the beach, the waves, and the beautiful scene at Waikiki. The open concept layout of the hotel allows patrons to walk inside the hotel to the intersection that Waikiki Beach is located, so we are practically right on the beach (even though our hotel room was located in the tower that is further from the beach). The service of the hotel has been excellent. Whenever there was a need, we were able to receive assistance in a timely fashion. In the one case where the wi-fi network did not work in our room, two-days worth of resort fees were waived to compensate for our inconvenience. Parking at the hotel is expensive, but you can actually park at Honolulu Zoo, a five-minute walk from the hotel, at the rate of $1USD/hr. We didn't find the parking to be an issue. Just a reminder: Marriott has two entrances for cars - one side appears to be for valet parking only, but there did not appear to be signs indicating that. We were told to remove our vehicle when trying to drop off a toddler, and that was an annoyance. Honolulu has so many things to do and so many sights to see that we did not really take advantage of most of the services available at the hotel. It is a nice touch, for example, that it has a ABC store located right in the lobby to see some of the absolute essentials. Mind you, there are probably two million ABC stores in Honolulu anyway. Within walking distance of Marriott, I can remember at least six or seven. Some reviewers mentioned the slowness of the elevators. We didn't find that to be a problem until the last day of our stay, a holiday, when a bunch of patrons were checking in and they actually caused the elevators to stop working altogether. We were in need to check out, so had to call the front desk to have them send a security up to take us down on the elevator. For a hotel with as many patrons though, five elevators per tower may not quite be enough. We have really enjoyed our stay at Waikiki Beach Marriott, and will be definitely considering a return to this hotel should we visit Honolulu again.","Vancouver, Canada","Ed L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",66,5.0

The extra service charges, taxes, delivery charge and pre-assigned gratuity will skyrocket the cost. 4. It's way cheaper to rent an Enterprise Car at the hotel then at the airport.

I found this Marriott so tired and disappointing that I will not go back, and in fact have been back to Honolulu one other time with great results elsewhere. Now to this visit:The hotel is located at one end of Waikiki. It is not on the beach, it is across the street from the beach. Other hotels are right on the beach. Please make a note of that. It is a ten minute walk to near the center of the main street, 15 minutes when there are a lot of people out, like all day every day. So, there are better locations also. The property is quite large and you can walk 5 minutes just to get to the front door. Checkin was quite the experience. I swear my agent was on something, moving at turtle speed, slurring his words and more. I asked for a map of the Marriott property and he could not find one and gave me real attitude about this simple request. Quite odd actually. I also was given a double bed room, even though there were kings available and it was clear I was traveling solo. So much for taking care of one's affinity guests... I went back down and requested a different room and they did get me another room but it should have been that way to begin with. The room was ok, typical Marriott fare, but the rooms need to be updated for sure. And as others have said, the elevators are jurassic at best. There seemed to be no service elevator either as we had to share three elevators with a load in of a band playing at an event there. There is no amenities for food it seemed. Some restaurants just outside but not a clear choice go to place. I did eat the buffet one night, I will share about that in another review, it was just ok, keeping with the disappointing stay overall.There are better more central choices a few blocks down the street with better food, better customer service and better location, for the same or a little less money.

They're oddly rude, even as an Elite member which makes me wonder how they treat their non-elite customers, especially the front desk personnel. Because of the Elite membership they did upgrade our room to an ocean view on a higher floor and because they have no concierge room for Elite members, the continental breakfast was comped, which was nice. Despite this, I still would never recommend staying here despite the ""perks"". It's also in the far end of Waikiki, which is incredibly inconvenient if you don't have a car rental. The hotel itself is huge, and difficult to navigate around, and makes you feel like you're in a maze of a mall rather than on vacation in a resort. Also, calling this hotel a resort is a bit of a stretch, since the nicer resorts I stayed made you feel like you were getting your money's worth with the extra resort fees you pay.

The hotel was very crowded with lots of groups using this accommodation but we still managed to find a good spot around the main pool bar area in the evening to watch the sunset and fireworks from one of the other beach hotels. Nobody mentioned that there are two pools at this complex! The larger pool with beach views was in the building adjoining ours.","Bristol, United Kingdom","recentlybeen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, United Kingdom</strong>",13,4.0

First the good stuff, we had a nice room with a great ocean view and we saw rainbows a few times. Our room was cleaned well daily. The hotel is in a good location on the less busy end of the strip (although still too busy for us). We walked most days to the outrigger canoe club so this is a great location if you are going to the OCC.Sensei is located within the hotel in the p tower if I remember correctly which is always good, a plus for close location.Now for the not so good: Aside from the cleaning staff (who were great), the other staff weren't very friendly or helpful. The hotel itself is very large and too busy for our taste. We did self-parking for $32 a day (valet is $38) and the parking lot is very tight and often hard to get a spot when you return at the end of night which can be a little stressful for what is supposed to be a relaxing vacation. The parking lot is so tight you have to backup and pull over if another car is coming from the opposite direction. There's a $30/day resort fee as well (you don't get anything for it) although they pretend to give you some coupons you probably won't use....some for the Seattles Best coffee shop in the hotel. We tried it once but the coffee was terrible so we didn't use the coupons again. In summary, count on an extra $60/day for the hidden fees. Very expensive, too big, too busy and not relaxing....it's a condo for us next time!","Calgary, Canada","Oceanbound80</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",14,3.0

Good points are the staff was helpful and the location was quite good but to call it a 'resort and spa' seems a bit overstated when compared to other properties we've stayed at before.The noise level inside the room was higher than expected but it could be that we were just unfortunate to be put next to a family who thought they could sing all night. Considering this is a Marriott property, it was a surprisingly a bare bones experience. For example, there were no robes, slippers, not enough bath towels or any other special amenities in the room which seems to be standard in most other resort type hotels.The breakfasts were ok but nothing special beyond what one sees at any other US chain hotel. The lines were long most mornings due to the conventions at the hotel plus the overseas tour groups who seemed to not follow any order when jumping the line to get in front of others who've been waiting longer. The restaurant staff just seemed to accept this practice that tour groups must have some kind of priority over other customers.There was nothing particular negative about the overall experience but, on the other hand, there wasn't anything positive as well to leave me walking away thinking I should really visit again.","Las Vegas, Nevada","GManSeoul</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",61,3.0

My 2yr old Granddaughter was admitted to the children's hospital here in Honolulu, and was diagnosed with Leukemia, treatment was started immediately and we needed to find a place close to her to stay, as we were helping with the care of our Son's other baby, our Grandson. Our 4 Generation Oahu family vacation quickly turned into one from hell. My Son had found 1 smallish room here, we tried to squeeze 2 adults into a full size bed while my Daughter in-law's Mom slept in the other, and we surrounded the baby's pack and play bed with the black out curtain for 1 night. But with our Daughter flying in that day to stay as well, we needed another room bad, or at least an airbed if need be. I went to the front desk, explained our situation, and couldn't control my emotions and started breaking down crying, I had been an emotional mess for days (still am) The woman at the front desk, petite beautiful Wendy Perez, such a sweetheart, gave me what I really needed right then, a HUG! She was a softy as well, she knew we needed help in our situation. I just needed a room close by the other one, view didn't matter, or size of room, just a bed and a bathroom for Husband and me as we took shifts at the hospital. Lets just say Wendy went above and beyond for us, even pulling an extension for our stay if needed, we didn't. After coming back to the room later that evening, she had a card slipped under the door saying she was thinking of us and our Granddaughter in her prayers. I was so touched by her sensitivity, and kindness. I will NEVER forget her. On check out, she was off work for a few days, so I didn't get to give her a proper mahalo, and Aloha. I hope she sees this and so does her Supervisor. When we return, which we will, I'm coming here to stay for sure!!

If you are Marriot rewards member, wifi is complimentary.","Seattle, Washington","DTravelDiva</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",69,5.0

At check in every need was fulfilled, they treated us like we were important to them. At check out they checked to make sure they met all of our needs.We didn't find this to be a super high end Marriott, but this is Hawaii, and you are paying to be right on the beach.Overall another great Marriott experience.",Upper Peninsula,"G Roger P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Upper Peninsula</strong>",83,5.0

My children had school break and came with me to Oahu. I chose to stay at Marriott because it was arranged through my conference. It was a very bad experience! Hotel does not have private beach. The public beach which is located across the street from the hotel was filled with drug addicts and homeless people. I could not take my children to the beach at all. Hotel swimming pools are very small and uncomfortable. There was garbage everywhere. Near the pool garbage was never removed. This hotel is completely open and has multiple entrances. Drunks were walking around the hotel especially at night. Elevators smelled like beer. I did not feel secure at all. Would not recommend this place to anyone traveling with kids. ,,Orchid10467,8,1.0

The ""mall feel"" between the lobby and the beach is a bit much - but we quickly got use to it. Sansei restaurant is great for sushi and the beach terrace bar is great for happy hour and music entertainment. For some the pools might be a bit small, but didn't bother us - we didn't use the pools. With breakfast and drinks and no car to park, the $30/day resort fee actually isn't a rip off - most are - not here.

Reasonable price, but made for family rravel, business travel and a holiday. Great gym, beach is a one minute walk outside the door, lots of restaurants and shops outside and in the hotel, and the staff were really great. Room was comfortable, clean and in good shape. Although my room didn't have a direct back view, from my balcony I had a nice one. A south facing room gets you a great beach view. I stayed for a week and had plenty of things to keep me busy when not working. Great location for nice beach runs and a run around Diamond Head. It's located at the east end of Waikiki and perhaps a little quieter than the other end. However, little longer to get on H1 from there vs the west end.

The morning staff was genuinely engaging and pleasant and remembered us after the first morning. the only marginal part of our stay was the pool bar staff (it's the only place on property to get a cocktail or appetizer near sunset). Service was slow and there were obviously not happy folks. It's the only time in years of staying at Marriott's that I got a ""that's not my table"" and have service staff walk away.

The staff are wonderful! During our stay we were assisted by Jorge the dining manager and Tina at the reservation desk who went out of their way for us; Natividad our housekeeper was awesome and so was Natacia who is with security. They all went over and above the call of duty to make our stay awesome. The breakfast buffet at Kuhio Beach Grill is sooo good and the coffee was INCREDIBLE. Madonna was my server every day and she was excellent! This was my first time in HI and I went with my husband as part of his business trip then we stayed afterward for pleasure. I learned that Waikiki is very commercial and rather urban so it conflicted a bit with the image I had in my mind of Hawaii. I did not like trying to relax at the pool and hearing sirens, trucks, horns blaring, traffic, etc. but that's not the fault of the hotel .... it's a geographical issue. I would recommend another island or hotel if you are looking for that lush, tropical scenery. The pools are adequate but I was surprised the Marriott did not invest more in landscaping those areas to create better ambiance. We had a partial ocean view room. The room was adequate. Nothing spectacular but it wasn't bad either. Typical neat, clean Marriott I'm accustomed to. Mattress was rather hard for my taste and could stand an upgrade in my opinion. I would've like to have gotten a better night of sleep. Not sure what the other reviewer meant about the sink being out in the open. It was on the other side of the wall in our room as they normally are. I appreciated having numerous outlets in the room (esp near the bed) for my many devices. The partial ocean view nearly went unnoticed because of the angle of the room. You have to sit at the far end of the balcony to see the ocean .... but it's there. Overall, I really enjoyed the hotel. Loved the open air lobby. Waikiki Beach is awesome and shopping was good - everything from souvenir shops to Rodeo Drive retailers.","Atlanta, Georgia","MizzPeachy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",11,5.0

The general lobby area is really very nice and had a welcoming feeling to it. I was placed in a room with partial ocean view and view of Diamond Head. The rooms are clean and functional, but nothing special about them. I also had complimentary breakfast buffet due to my membership status. The selections are the same every single day. They should change the menu and should have more local food (they didn't even have spam!). I heard it's $30/person, and I would have been disappointed if I had paid. There are two pools in the property - one on each side of the two towers, but neither is impressive. The pool on the side where there is a hot tub is less impressive than the pool on the other side without the hot tub. I think if the property is being billed as a ""resort,"" it should have a better pool. The location of the hotel is actually pretty good, but it is towards the end of the ""strip."" The staff whom I interacted with were all very professional and nice, so thank you for that!

Overall great location, only a block from the main beach. Great shopping and restaurants just a short walk away. Great service at the reception desk and they worked hard to get me in early since my flight came in at 0700. Valet staff was very friendly and nice - big kudos. A couple issues with the hotel. Only two of six elevators were working. Large crowds waited in the lobby to get to their rooms at peak times. Seattle Beat coffee shop in the lobby is absolutely terrible. Unclean, marginal coffee and latte was just coffee with warm milk. Ladies were not very nice behind the counter. Acted like I put them out ordering a cup of coffee. I know they might not answer to Marriott but they need to tighten up their area because it is in the Marriott area. The rooms are very nice but not a fan of the sink area out in the open. Family tried to sleep in while I had to have the lights on to get t day early in the morning. The street noise at night was load too. Made it difficult to fall asleep at night. Need better sound proofing on the sliders. Overall, I would stay here again but I would ask for a room on a higher floor (we stayed on the 12th floor - too close to the street). I would also go down the street to Starbucks for a cup of coffee. ","Hayden Lake, Idaho","fishingherbivore</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hayden Lake, Idaho</strong>",42,4.0

We had just finished 2 lovely weeks in KoOlina when we checked into this huge property just across the street from the beach. Granted, it has a beautiful view and great location. We are Marriott Platinum Elite members with over 1 million points currently. We used points for our stay and had our adult kids with us when we checked in, who were heading to the airport in a few hours. My wife asked Lindsee, the young lady at the counter if we could get an upgrade to have a bit more room. She stated we already had the best room she could us give as the ""hotel was full of guests that were paying for their rooms"". Not the best way to handle this. The next night, we called room service ant ordered 2 salads that we $27 a piece. I asked for a couple of dinner rolls and was told they would be 75 cents a piece. Again, an attitude like this most likely comes from the management or lack there of. Either this franchisee has lost its mind not realizing there are plenty of other rooms in the neighborhood where people are willing to spend $400 plus a night , or they just don't care. The room was nice, but the the carpet was worn, the plumbing dated and the whole place could use a good face lift. Next time we'll stay at the Westin.
