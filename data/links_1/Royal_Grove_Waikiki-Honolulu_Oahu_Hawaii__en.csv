Our room had a nice balcony were we could rest and our room offered a kitchen and a fridge really convenient in case you want to cook and also just to mingle a bit together. It has a small swimming pool which is convenient if you do not want to go to the really close Waikiki beach. But if you prefer to go to the beach it is less than 2 minutes walking. Staff at the hotel were really nice and helpful too. Besides being super close to the beach is near many Waikiki attractions as well as a shopping area.

You could see it from the street, in the hallways, etc. I find it dirty (not in a sense of not cleaning it up, but just very old, who knows how old are the stains on the spring boxes). The building sits at the very busy Kuhio avenue and it is low-rise, so you can hear all the noise, so if you have a weak sleep - you will have a bad time. There is a eat-out/in place downstairs as well as convenience store (with alcohol). Apart from street noise, this area is known for homeless people, so you could hear screams outside. Also, there is notice on the wall - do not leave valuables in room, safety box at front desk. Security seems to be an issue. Advertised as a non-smoking hotel, but cigarette butt almost hit my head while it was dropped from the hotel balcony. This is a walk-up building, easily accessible from street, particularly during daytime. Some positives - there is a daily housekeeping for making up beds, refreshing towels. Our unit had a fridge, stove, hot plate, toaster, microwave and coffee maker and some utensils, pots, glasses. It is also in the hearth of Waikiki, 5 minutes from the beach, with plenty shops and restaurants within walking distance. Front desk borrows beach towels and staff is friendly. Based on other visitors I could see in this hotel it seems that some (senior) like to return. A/C in room worked. But paying almost $200/night (with taxes) for 3 people (high season) for a very run-down hotel, it is not worth staying. I feel sorry not only for guests but also for housekeepers and the staff working in here, who really tried to keep it running.","Cambridge, Massachusetts","Azzi E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts</strong>",38,2.0

This is an older hotel that could use some upgrades and there are no frills. We had a basic room with a small kitchenette stocked with dishes, pots, pans, silverware, cleaning supplies and a small (full) size refridgerator. The room was decent size for 2 adults, a family of 4 may need more space. The bed was ok, bedding was clean. The bathroom was basic sink, toilet and tub. Overall, the place is clean, no bugs of any kind were spotted. However, the cleaning staff had overlooked dusting some areas for awhile. Our room was on the ground floor near the pool, but we heard very little noise. The pool is very small and in need of some maintenance, but clean and functional, and Waikiki Beach is only 1 block away!! WiFi is only available in the lobby/reception area. A designated unsheltered smoking area is located about 25 ft. from the side entrance along the street. As there is no smoking in all of Hawaii you're at the mercy of what area is available. We don't smoke, but even we thought it was inconvenient. The front desk staff was very nice. Beach accessories are available to the quests at no charge; chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards even a surf board! A public parking garage is across the street for a fee ($30/day). If you're not looking for anything special and not going to be in the room much, this place can save you a lot of money.","Syracuse, New York","Dottie H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Syracuse, New York</strong>",49,3.0

We understood it was a lower end hotel. But, upon arriving, it was much worse. First, the room had rust colored mold along the electrical wiring covers (see photos). Second, the locks on the door were a issue. We were handed a physical brass key and the room had three locks on the inside. We had a chain lock, a door knob lock, and a door stopper that we felt the need to secure on the backside. There was two signs in our room, one near the door and one above the bathroom that read ""DO NOT LEAVE ANY VALUABLES IN ROOM SAFE DEPOSIT BOXES AT FRONT DESK"". Which is not inspiring to safety. The bathroom was tiny, without a vanity and a broken toilet. After one use the toilet would not flush and the chain was still attached inside the tank. We then sat down and started looking for a new hotel. When we went downstairs to cancel our reservation, the staff was not phased at all. Which leads me to assume, this happens all the time.

The staff are some of the friendliest we have met in our travels and really contributed to this being our favourite trip yet. The hotel is very kitschy and has lots of character. If you are looking for the blandness of corporate hotels then you may not be as happy as we are with this lodging. The Royal Grove fosters a strong sense of community - one we have not experienced in our travels to date. There is a music night (think it was Wednesday) that is a lot of fun. We just missed the American Thanksgiving potluck that was taking place on Sunday night, but looked like a good time. The hotel is spotless - the cleaning staff are among the best there is, and friendly. The rooms are quite big - they are the old style rooms, reminiscent of a time gone by. The lanais are nice size with a full kitchen in most of them. The water pressure in the shower is great - really strong, and the bed is comfortable. Wi-fi is available in the lobby, which is a bonus because when you are in the lobby on your laptop or phone, you are also interacting with the residents of the hotel. Even the laundry room is a social space and connected to the pool/social area. It is so much fun it is hard to describe. Support this small, independent business and book early. This place is not a hidden gem; it is well discovered so you need to plan ahead if you want to stay here. We will also point out you are 2 blocks from one of the best parts of Waikiki Beach, and there are many restaurants and places for coffee near by, including an ABC store 1/2 block from the entrance.

We visited Hawaii the second week of September and stayed for a full 7 days. I would not recommend anyone stay anywhere but here. The two main factors were location and price, however everything else about our stay was excellent as well.If you’re the kind of person who plans to spend most of their vacation on Waikiki Beach and at the hotel itself, you may want to look elsewhere. However, for our purposes, this hotel was perfect. We had a large, clean room with a full kitchenette (oven, stove, microwave, toaster, full fridge, and plenty of cooking and eating utensils) and a balcony with a view of the ocean for under $650 for the week, which is ridiculous compared to other hotels in the area. We easily made breakfast in the mornings and ate on the balcony before heading out for the day. Royal Grove is just a two-block walk from Waikiki Beach, and very close to plenty of shopping, convenience stores, and restaurants. The hotel is also just a couple blocks from bus stop. To add further convenience, there are beach towels and accessories (floaties, noodles, chairs, etc.) you are able to use for the day and return (at no additional charge). Our sleep quality was good; there is a little bit of noise from the street, but you are in a city so it’s to be expected. The air conditioning worked well. The staff was helpful and polite, and other guests were pleasant as well. The only downside might be the lack of WiFi except for in the lobby, but who comes to Hawaii to sit on their computer/phone? The hotel is a little older, but we found it more charming than anything, the pink building reminiscent of old Hawaii. I feel like my review really can’t do this hotel justice, as it was exactly what we were looking for and turned out to be such a hidden gem. If we ever visit Honolulu in the future, we will definitely stay again!As an extra tip, if you are renting a vehicle, look for free overnight parking (after 6PM and before 7AM) at the metered streets over near the Honolulu Zoo. We utilized this during our stay, and it was wonderful compared to spending $30+ per night parking in a lot or garage.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","mintysnowflake7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong>",30,5.0

Four wonderful factors:a) Fun, family-oriented and authentic (Monday nights are such fun!)b) Location to Kuhio Beach -- just two blocks/five minutesc) Amenities -- comes with kitchenette and refrigerator, which is great since the only grocery store in all of Waikiki is only about a 7-minute walk from the hotel and we love to purchase fresh pineapple, breakfast foods, and salads to enjoy at our convenienced) Fantastic rates, particularly when you stay for a week or longer.Plus they have beach chairs, umbrellas and such you can borrow. We often pick up dinner to go at the delicious take-out place next door and bring it back up to the room/patio to enjoy. There's internet in the main lobby (but honestly I enjoy mostly being away from that when on vacation). Finally, with the great location it's a short walk to many wonderful places in Waikiki Beach, including the Starbucks Reserve (maybe 10 strolling minutes away)!Love coming here!",,JeanetteN264,4,5.0

Good room, the rates are a bonus and the bed were comfortable. I did spend more time in the room in the evenings \, very nice experience. I will be going back this August for 10 days in the class 3 rooms. Easy access to the Bus and all of the good places to eat. I had a late evening flight and they allowed me to check out late with no extra cost. The staff is great. I really loved the 60's feel",,Glenn B,6,4.0

Returning earlier this month (for one week) was like coming home. The Royal Grove, in our view, is still the best deal in Honolulu--the prices haven't changed since we were last there and the rooms are just as clean and neat as we left them two years ago.Part of that is has to do with their clientele, who tend to be older and not inclined to partying. And part of it is because of the exceptional housekeeping service by people like Besita, who, like everything else at the Royal Grove, is reliable, dependable, and always courteous to guests who need an extra bar of soap or roll of toilet paper! We were lucky to have the same room we had during our original visit in 2016--Room 506--and it was just as neat and clean this time around. The lanai (patio) still provides both great tropical bird sightings and views of Waikiki (both street side and ocean). Now for a reality check re: amenities: There are few. And the bathroom is small--very small. There is no fan, so the humidity tends to build-up and leave clothing hung in the adjacent closet a bit damp. The bathroom fixtures are small--do not expect a huge shower (although since we were last there, they have installed a handheld shower head which is convenient for those want to shampoo their hair or just rinse off sand) or sink area. Water pressure leaves a bit to be desired--but given there are probably close to 100,000 people showering every morning in the hotels that line Waikiki, that may be more typical than specific to the Royal Grove. The beds were basic, but comfortable And the kitchenette is great for dining in after shopping at the nearby Farmer's Market (M-W-F-Sat, 4-9 p.m.) or grabbing carry-out from one of the many neighborhood eateries.The air conditioner tended to shut off automatically, which was a bit of a problem because noisy garbage trucks roll down Waikiki around 6:30 a.m., and without any white noise to block out the trucks--well, consider the garbage caravan your alarm clock and make the most of the day! For whatever amenities it may lack,The Royal Grove more than makes up with vintage charm, a quirky personality, and extremely budget-friendly prices.","Nashville, Tennessee","tennesseetraveler58</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",50,4.0

We had a street facing room on the 5th floor with an L shaped balcony that had a large table and 2 chairs. We used it every day to have coffee in the morning and a cold drink at night to review our day. It had a view all the way down to the beach. We are city people, and live downtown, so street noise is not a big deal for us. The air conditioner was loud though. It did keep the room comfortable for sleeping.There was a kitchenette, with large fridge and utensils that we used several times. The pool area is convenient, and even the pool itself was perfect to cool off as you sun yourself in one of the many seats around the pool.Wi-fi is available, but only in the lobby/pool area. I do wish it was usable in the room.The only real negative is no room safe. They use an archaic bank safety deposit box which doesn't hold much. So I had to take my expensive camera with me most of the time, even when I didn't want to.The staff were very friendly, and helpful. Other hotels could learn a great deal from them about customer service.Best of all, no resort fees.We would stay at the Royal Grove when we return to Waikiki without any hesitation.","Vancouver, Canada","trevanorak</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",4,4.0

We wanted Waikiki or what's left of it and here it is. The salmon pink building is straight out of the 50s/60s. The hotel lobby is cluttered with artefacts from another era, like my old Nan's sitting room. The welcome's personal, we're treated like old friends although it's our first time there. The room's a good size with a kitchenette, oversized fridge and a slightly cramped bathroom. It's 70s/80s decoration. We've got a balcony (lannai) with a table and 2 chairs. It's looks down on the pool and other guests sunning it. The bed's a bit small but comfortable. It's a 50 metre walk to Waikiki beach. There's a Mexican cantina on the corner, a Japanese eat-in/ takeaway opposite, a Korean next door and a Poke place on the corner. The Bus can be caught 50 metres away on Kuhio St. All this and it's about A$100 a night. Oh and the Monday night performance including hula dancing is a bonus.",Adelaide,"MrThrill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide</strong>",56,5.0
