This Hotel is a 3 Star ""Type ( Class?)"" of Hotel , where as the Four Seasons, Waldorf etc., are 5 Star Type/Class of Hotels. People give a Holiday In Express 5 Stars and then the Waldorf Astoria gets a 5 Star.. um what the heck?  Shibuya Stream Excel Hotel Tokyu.. I give this 3 Star Class Hotel a 4 star review.• Pros. Location is great, Staff is accommodating, Room was clean, Bed/Pillows were great, the Concept of Amenities available on each floor is cool. One floor is the Kitchen/Food Meister has microwave, rice cooker and other similar, another floor is the Clothes (?) Meister- has pants iron, ironing boards, shoe polisher etc., another has ice, etc . Very nice looking hotel lobby and halls.• Cons. Our room was TINY! #1320 and we paid for the upgrade! -Tiny Room Fridge is really just to keep things 'cool' not cold. - TV 98% Japanese stations (Other Japan Hotels have ample English channels). - The Breakfast included was a BIG WASTE of time and money.... you choose from one of 4 choices which are each small portions.... i.e, french toast is 1/2 piece of bread cut in half again and 1/2 piece of bacon, watered down tomato juice, very few choices at their so called buffer area. - HARD TO FIND..this hotel is very hard to find... the address you give to a taxi driver is a huge building and area and this hotel is floors 9-13 and their lobby on the 4th floor.","Naperville, Illinois","boomer810</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Naperville, Illinois</strong>",11,3.0

Few things that can be improved:- In-room dining options can be provided for business travelers who are tired to go out; especially since it gets quite cold outside- vegetarian and vegan menus since the people who come and stay are global travelers- Keeping a microwave and some plates in the room for in-room eating- There was a kitchen on the 13th floor but there were no cooking utensils or guides to use the devices.

This hotel seemed to fit the bill so I booked it. Imagine our surprise when, upon entering our room, we found that there was a queen-sized bed... and nothing else. A visit to the reception revealed that there are no rollaway beds/sofabeds or even floor mattresses available at this hotel. Not a single one.""Where is my child supposed to sleep?""The receptionist shrugs. Don't know, don't care.""Why are you advertising this room for 'up to 3 people' when that is obviously not truthful?""Another shrug.Further discussion revealed that they DID, in fact, have a room available that could fit an extra bed - for more than twice the price.(Now, if this hotel had any sense of customer service, they would've said ""Sorry, we messed up, please allow us to move you to a room that matches what you actually booked""... but evidently that's not how this hotel rolls.)At this point it was long past my child's bedtime so, begrudgingly, we paid the difference and received the key to the bigger corner room.Imagine our surprise (again!) when we entered the new, bigger room and there was still no extra bed! There was only a narrow, short, extremely hard chaise-longue whose shape did not allow for any practical addition of bedlinen. Speaking of which, there was none. Another call to the reception and they delivered us one (1) flat sheet and one (1) very scratchy woollen blanket. No pillow, no blanket cover. We make do the best we can with what we've got. Every morning the housekeeping un-made the sorry excuse of a bed back into a chaise-longue. We had to keep re-making it over and over again. None of us got much rest during our stay in Tokyo and we were glad to leave at the end.Families: THIS HOTEL DOES NOT WANT YOUR CUSTOM. I'd strongly advise you to stay away.The attitude of the staff makes it impossible for me to recommend this hotel to anyone, with children or not.","Espoo, Finland","DDiana6</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Espoo, Finland</strong>",22,1.0

First and foremost you cannot beat the location! It’s literally on top of the metro station, in the middle of Tokyo. The hotel is spotless, and the staff was so incredibly helpful, which went out if their way to assist us. I asked about the toll highways and moments later a letter with detailed directions, calculated toll fees to our destination, including a personal bakery recommendation arrived. We regretted staying in another hotel in Shinjuku a few days later. The hotel’s laundry room (equipped with washers pre-loaded with soap and softener) is an awesome amenity for those that like to pack light.

This made the ridiculous ceiling lamp, which you can’t help but hit your head on repeatedly even more of a nuisance (form over function for sure!)Secondly, when booking found the price varied wildly from night to night: as much as several hundred dollars difference dollars for a single, even though I was booking months in advance. So I wasn’t able to string as many nights together here as I would’ve liked, and had to split up my stay with another hotel (which was good, and so will probably stay in that one place next time instead of here).The staff was friendly, as usual. Just a few strange things that made the stay less enjoyable... First of all, I made the mistake of trying to do laundry this time around. They have one coin washer/dryer FOR THE ENTIRE HOTEL!!!!! Then, instead of having an iron and ironing board in the room as many Japanese hotels do, or a trouser press at least (as almost all Japanese hotels do), they direct you to their “meister” floor, which has to be one of the most idiotic ideas ever: it has 2 irons, again to be shared by THE ENTIRE HOTEL. And if you choose to use the trouser presses here, you’ve got to just wait around; one of the great conveniences to having a trouser press in your room is you can do other things and then voila your pants are pressed. They have other “meister” floors too, like a “drink meister” floor with vending machine, which really means they only have one vending machine for drinks again, IN THE ENTIRE HOTEL. I began to realize this “meister” concept, which they promote a lot, is really just a way for them to cut corners. On the plus side, there is a 7-11 outside on the ground floor, and an absolutely fabulous grilled fish restaurant on one of the restaurant floors (outside the hotel but inside the same mixed-use building). Lunch here is particularly reasonable and it’s food that’s not easy to get outside Japan.","New York, NY","mikebern</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",129,3.0

The design of the room is modern and spacious. Love the design of the long sofa in the room and it was comfortable. The bed, omg! The quality of the pillows and blankets were so good and the bed was so comfy that it put all my hotel stays before that during this trip to shame. They also provided decent and sufficient amenity kit. My husband complained that the shaving cream/gel and the shaver were not working that well though.The location was great since it’s located within a mall with variety of food and drinks, and it’s near the train station. I love the ideas of the “Meister Rooms”. They look clean and modern and are very useful. I’m not sure if 1 washer and 1 dryer in the Style Meister is enough. It was being used when I first saw it, so I had to wait for awhile until the washer is vacant.However, the variety of the mains for breakfast is quite limited. 2 breakfasts in the hotel is ok, 3 is probably too much.

The staff is wonderful and super helpful HOWEVER very strange vibes. I left my room for lunch and within an hour someone came in my room and manged to put all my towels on the floor without cleaning anything else. There was water on the floor of the shower but no sign of cleaning. The sheets had been pulled back to their original position but the bed was not made and trash remained. Also how you have a toilet room without a dimmer is beyond me. I haven't slept in 3 nights because when I go to the restroom at 2 in the morning I'm woken up by a freaking spotlight that AUTOMATICALLY turns on. For a hotel this nice, you would think they have soundproofing from street noise. No. I've been awoken by sirens every night. The temperature is a whole different challenge. Again for a hotel this nice you'd think they have central air but there's an AC unit in my room that I swear only has a high setting, it stays a freezing 60 degrees even though it's set to ""72"". Bidets are nice, oh and breakfast is good. Again staff that I've interacted with have been nice but this is a joke.

The hotel also has a huge range of casual and fancy restaurants on the floors beneath it, and is close to the main Shibuya tourist sights.Room: Generous for Japan standards (but cosy for Westerners!), and extremely clean.

Each room has a dehumidifier/air-purifier, and is stocked with free water bottles each day.Food: Breakfast was included and was offered until 1000 (latest arrival 0930). We were offered a choice of french toast, omelette, fried eggs or eggs benedict; then we could help ourselves to a decent Western+Japanese buffet table (including muesli, yoghurt, salads, breads and pastries, and drinks). The bar and restaurants on the lobby level were also good. There is a room service robot which can deliver a range of snacks to your room - we highly recommend trying this as a novelty!Facilities: The hotel has complementary very fast free Wi-Fi throughout.

For maximum sensory overload (and convenience) there’s a well-known four-star Excel Hotel Tokyu right in the middle of the action—but there’s also a sister property a safe distance away. This is where my girlfriend and I stayed this past April, at the three-star Shibuya Stream Excel Hotel Tokyu.LocationIf you’re taking the NEX in from Narita then getting to the Stream is fairly straightforward; the hotel is a short block from the Shibuya Station New South Exit. But if you’re arriving via Haneda (like we were) then your best route to the hotel requires a Limousine Bus to the Cerulean, then a transfer to a free taxi for the rest of the way, compliments of the Tokyu Hotels group.Once you’re checked in you’ll want to familiarize yourself with the underground path to Shibuya station proper. It’s more than a bit daunting with a sea of people walking in either direction down there, but once you figure it out you can walk to the Hachiko Exit in less then ten minutes.There’s also lots of decent restaurants closer to the hotel, along with a generally more relaxed vibe than the other side of the highway.RoomWe booked a Standard Double and were assigned to Room #1329. Though a bit on the small side it was very smartly laid out, except for the bed. Hoteliers take note: pushing a bed up against a wall is cruel and unusual punishment for your guests.The bathroom was split into three separate areas, with the sink and vanity mirror in the main room. The very modern Japanese washlet was tucked away behind a separate door, as was the wet room with a shower and tub. For a couple sharing their morning routines this worked out great.BreakfastBreakfast downstairs was a modest affair but got the job done. The buffet table offered salad, soup, fruit, yogurt, bread, cereal and pastries. Coffee, tea and juices could be dispensed at separate stations. Curiously, the teas were only available via coffee-style pods.In addition to the buffet diners could also order a hot entrée direct from the kitchen. The two options during our stay were eggs benedict and french toast; this proud Canadian went with the latter and had no complaints—even with the bizarre orange sauce option, which was actually quite tasty.VerdictThough I must deduct points for the bed up against the wall (you monsters) I would still recommend the Shibuya Stream for any visitor to Tokyo who wants to be near the action, but not right in the middle of it.","Toronto, Canada","Andrew C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",109,4.0

Very convenient and straightforward. Just take exit 16 and you're at the hotel building.The size of the room we had was very very very good given that Tokyo hotel rooms are really tiny. This came with a small living space next to the windows and the bathroom was huge by Tokyo standards! Very thoughtful amenity kits were also provided. Cleaning was great throughout our one week stay.One small area of improvement would be front desk staff. Everytime I communicated with them, regardless of whether it is to help with making restaurant reservations or to ask them to fix the broken minibar fridge in our room, the staff didn't seem too keen. In fact, it's often less than the regular Japanese standard of service. Quite disappointing sometimes really.There were many choice places for food within the building like a Luke's lobster roll kiosk as well as Starbucks. Many eateries within 2 mins of it.

Right now best access is from “Shin-Minami” JR Exit which is good for Saikyo, Rinkan, Shonan-Shinjuku, and Narita Express lines, but not for the ubiquitous Yamanote Line. On the other side of the hotel there’s easy access to Tokyu Toyoko Line and subway Hanzomon Line, but not the ubiquitous Ginza Line.

Beds have pillow-tops and are comfortable. There’s a reasonable amount of space around the sink for toiletries.There are many excellent restaurants in the building outside of the hotel (I did not eat @ the hotel). I especially enjoyed one specializing in grilled fish. There is a 7-11 downstairs.The only real huge mistake in design was a low hanging lamp in the middle of the room that seemed to be there just for the purpose of hitting my head on it a million times. Several other things in the room seemed a bit too compact: a refrigerator about 1/2 the normal “Japan hotel” size, and an in room safe also about 1/2 the normal size (could not fit my very small laptop.) The room could’ve used a full-length or at least bigger mirror somewhere other than the sink. And there is no bath, only shower at least in single room.I also didn’t like how they made me pay (using automated machine) when I checked in, which unnecessarily made check-in a two-step process since an actual person handled the paperwork part. That was clunky. I had to use that machine again to check out, why not charge me then? (They already has my credit card from when I made the reservation.) With that said, the front desk staff was friendly and good.View from the room was tremendous. At a more expensive price I’d question my unquestioning devotion to this hotel right now. I even hesitated to write my review because I don’t want it to become so popular that the price will go up a lot!

What we love about Tokyo is the contradiction of the neon and big buildings (Shibuya) and the small, quant neighborhoods with small winding streets, cool shops and cafes. Shibuya stream is in the heart of the glitz but 15-30 minute walk to all these amazing neighborhoods. We tended to find dinner in the neighborhoods and our teenage girls loved the shopping in Shibuya and the hip show off the beaten path. The hotel is near every train line so great location to get around Tokyo. We got two rooms next to each other which was great. The price was definitely better than other options. Great hotel. Great location. Good price. This is a really nice, high end four star hotel. ","Mill Valley, California","Mikelemberg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mill Valley, California</strong>",49,5.0

The location was very convenient right next to the Shibuy Station. Restaurants and bars choices in the same building (Shibuya Stream). Having a mobile phone in the room that guests could use was also a nice gesture, we didn’t use it since we’ve already had everything arranged beforehand. Room was spacious enough. (-) The low hanging lamp right next to the bed was simply unwise and dangerous. If you don’t pay attention, you’d hit your head every time you use the table next to the window. No sink in the toilet and no wall hooks in the shower for towels. No storage space except one drawer that was half occupied by a safe. I had to put my suitcase in the toilet. The sink is actually in a hall corner between the bathroom and the toilet with limited space for personal stuff. Lots of waste: every day we got new slippers for no particular reason, breakfast tickets were printed on paper for each day per person (why not just use the key or room number?). Breakfast was disappointing with inadequate portions and limited choices. I particularly didn’t like the cook touching my food with his bare fingers and sending it back to me after I sent it back to the kitchen because it wasn’t what I ordered.","Rotterdam, The Netherlands","traveller_jvh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rotterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",37,3.0

From the JR underground, look for exit 16b (yellow exit signs) which take you to the bottom of the hotel. Reception is on the 4th floor above all the eateries. Beautiful room and decor. Great amenities. Easy check in and out. The views are amazing, even from the 9th floor which is the start of the accommodation levels. The rooms are nice and quiet. Cons: the layout doesn’t work. I booked the standard double (24sqm). The bed was pushed against the wall in order to squeeze in a freestanding desk and chair with pendant light. As a couple, it means one person has to crawl to the end of the bed to get out. And the amount of times we hit our heads on the pendant light!!!Having the basin outside the bathroom takes up valuable space and the hall area contained a decorative stand that was too small for luggage, which was a waste of space. There is nowhere to store luggage. I’ve previously stayed at the royal park hotel in Shiodome, in a room that was only 1 sqm larger, yet it felt huge in comparison because of the smarter layout.

You also get to order either a special egg dish or french toast dish, which is also included.This hotel can be reached from the international airport with the Narita Express (80 minutes or so). Shibuya is the biggest and most complicated station and intersection with dozens of exits and resembling crossroads. So; here’s a tip - when you get out of the Narita Express, immediately look for “New South Exit”.

Rude staff. Bad service model throughout. Length of stay: 6 days, 5 night. 12/20/18 to 12/25/18Service at the Shibuya Stream Excel Hotel Tokyu is appalling. There is a distinct lack of warmth and graciousness. Granted, the hotel has only been open for 3 months so this might be a matter of finessing their service model, but what we experienced points to one that is not customer-centric. Here are a few examples:1. After much appealing, they allowed us a late checkout time of 11:30 am; a full 30 minutes extra. He king out past that will incur a fee of about $100. At 11 am, we got a call from the front desk asking us to leave the room immediately! They are not accommodating, eager or even happy to make your stay more pleasant. 2. Seating for the breakfast buffet is baffling. There is an older gentleman who seats you. He is surly and rather stern. He will not seat a single person at a two-person table near the window. Go figure. 3. Perhaps it’s simply a lack of training, but no one at the front desk knows how to troubleshoot the hotel’s complimentary phone. Instead of trying to help you, they will simply tell you it can’t be done. Here are a few tips to make your stay bearable:1. The corner rooms are much larger. If you can, spring for this room type. 2. Don’t bother buying the hotel breakfast. It is a poor excuse of a buffet. No standard fare such as eggs, bacon or potatoes. Instead there is an assortment of breads, pickled herring, mushrooms, rice balls, salad leaves and yoghurt. 3. There is a deli on the second floor of the building (hotel lobby is on 4th). The food is reasonably priced and delicious to boot. There is also. Starbucks on the other side of the 2nd floor. If you go to the 1st floor, you’ll find Lawson and Family Mart a few steps away. 4. The hotel is close but not too close to the action. Plus, you can take side streets to avoid the mayhem of Shibuya Crossing and still get to all the amazing restaurant and bars.5. There is a washer and dryer on the 11th floor. Be prepared to spend at least an hour waiting for your clothes to dry. Be sure to clean the lint trap. There are many other places to stay in Shibuya so we would probably not stay there again because of the bad service. It’s a shame because I really love the location.

So I couldn't help but compare both hotels in terms of convenience.So Shibuya Stream opened and we decided to give it a try although we knew it was a bit far away. It is located at south of Shibuya station right next to Futoshin line. On google map it says about 250m walk from hotel to Shibuya station, yes it's close but you will need to go up and down bridge with stairs. In real life, there is a building (which is still being built) and a road in between Stream and station. The bridge linking the building and stream is not yet opened so you now have to walk among or around the construction site - which consists of turns and corners making the route longer. It was manageable but when you have to walk to the center of Shibuya eg Donki or 109 then it's gonna take 7-10 minutes. As for the hotel itself, room was nice with a retro 60s vibe. Somebody complained about storage and the sink in room. I had no problem with all that. Separating sink, toilet, and bathroom all made sense to us as we need not fight for using each of of those. Bed was comfy, bathroom was spacious, complimentary mineral water was offered. Room had no cold air-conditioning in November (hottest 20 degrees celsius outside) which was not to my liking but expected for a mid-price hotel in Japan. Service was beyond great, everyone speaks good English and was extremely helpful. We hadn't opt for breakfast so couldn't review the food. There was an interesting robot that looks like R2D2 that brings you stuff. We haven't tried it but when you try ordering water / amenities then the robot will take elevators and come to your door all by itself.There is no airport limousine bus stopping at the hotel. If you wanna take/arrive by one then you will have to take Stream's free shuttle to go to Mark City Tokyu Excel. The journey takes 10 minutes but only 1-2 rounds per hour so you will most likely need to spend another 15-20 mins wait time before you get on the limousine bus after you arrive Mark City. Also there is no drop off area for hotel guests. We arrived with our rented car and we had to park the car (with no validation offered) in order to unload all the luggage for check in. The building complex is cool with a few restaurants in the mall downstairs. The river was renovated with streaming effect but the smell was not very pleasant. Conclusion : I think I will go back to Mark City Tokyu Excel given its location. It's a comparatively older (but still good with older bathrooms & bedding etc.) hotel and not as nice as Stream but I was able to get to restaurants, shopping, or stations in less than 3 minutes. Price is also comparable between the two. Stream is nice but no limousine bus is a deal breaker as we always have many many suitcases and travelling with them on shuttles is just too much hassle. Also the relatively longer journey to center Shibuya can be quite tiring. Maybe the inconvenience can be improved after the in between building is finished in 2019 where you can walk a straight route to station (instead of turns and corners in a construction site right now).","Vancouver, Canada","Nanapuffy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",45,4.0

We had a standard double on the 9th floor. The bed was so comfortable! The bedding, the bath towels, and the soap and shampoo were all really nice. Some other reviewers mentioned that there's no space to put clothes, and there is no dresser, but there is a clothes rack with some shelves to put things underneath and we were able to find places to put all our things.The first few floors of the building have a lot of restaurants, which is nice to have the option to get coffee or something to eat without going far. The location is obviously really convenient to Shibuya station, and also really easy to walk to Harajuku and Daikanyama etc.The breakfast at the hotel is really good, you get a choice of entree (french toast or eggs benedict) and there's a selection of pastries, cheese, salad, yogurt, fresh fruit, cold cuts, cereal, rice croquettes, and juices and coffee. It's the same every day though, and since we stayed for 8 nights we only ate there a few times.Tips:From Shibuya station, use the Hachiko exit, go right and keep going right to go past the busses, and then you can go up the stairs to cross over the street and you'll see the hotel/Stream building plaza. The first day, we took the New South Exit which is close to the hotel, but you have to walk a really long ways through the station to get to the exit (unless you're on a train that's closer to it, but you'll likely be closer to Hachiko).To get to the airport, there's a bus that leaves from the Excel Hotel, and there's a free shuttle from the Steam to the Excel. It's really convenient and easy when you have luggage, instead of taking the trains.They give you a free cell phone to use with unlimited data/internet. I might not have rented a pocket wifi if I would have known about that.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","TravelingRam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",65,5.0

There are escalators that will lead you to the restaurant level of the building. Take the elevators towards the middle of the building to the 4th floor where you will find the lobby.

A lot of construction on going. Room size was good enough for me, my wife and 8 year old son. In Shibuya (let alone Tokyo), you're not really going to be hanging out in the room all day. We opted for the room and breakfast deal. Breakfast was limited to French Toast with a slice of Bacon or Eggs Benedict, there is also a small buffet with croissant, bread, salad, cereal and a few other choices. You can always get breakfast at many of the restaurants down stairs (some looked fairly pricey) or the surrounding area. 7-11, Lawson's, McDonald's is close by as well. Starbucks was not open downstairs yet. Try Luke's Lobster's, lobster roll and clam chowder for Lunch or Dinner, it's delicious. It's a short walk to the famous Hachiko statue and crossing.

It’s at the top 13th floor with the view of the river. It’s light up pretty at night. We can see Tokyo Tower from here too. What a view, at night!My favourite thing about Shibuya Stream is it’s location. I could walk to Harajuku without having to catch the metro (which can get super jampacked at peak hour). Very happy to just hang out in the area. NOTE: 1. Don’t get mixed up with their other vote called Shibuya Excel Hotel. However, if you do end up at the other hotel, they provide a free shuttle bus service :)2. Enquire about the free shuttle bus service.3. They had bus limousines to Tokyo Haneda and Narita airport. You’ll need to either purchase tickets from the bus driver or buy it early. Please do enquire at the desk :)4. There is a scale at the counter for you to weight your luggages. Just in case, if you ended up shopping waaaay too much :)Thank you for a wonderful stay again. Such a cool kind of hotel. I’m happy I got to check this place out before heading back to Sydney.You can find me on Instagram for more travel images. I love exploring new places whenever I can.Instagram @hellomissmayHope you’re having fun in Shibuya as much as I do! It’s a safe place to wonder around, explore, eat and shop.XMay","Sydney, Australia","hellomissmay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",70,5.0
