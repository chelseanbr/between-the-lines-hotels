It had everything i needed, it was just very compact.The restaurant wasn't open on Sunday evening, which i hadn't realised, but they recommended a nearby Italian which was superb.Breakfast was buffet or a la carte - i had cold buffet and it was absolutely delicious; fruit salad that actually tasted of fresh fruit and particularly good granola. The only criticism i had was that when i got back to my room after 16.00 it still hadn't been made up so i had to call housekeeping, who came to sort it out very quickly but it meant i had to go down to the lounge area.

Large room ( queen suite I think) as there were three of us and the pull out sofa bed in a separate area worked well. Clean room and serviced daily. Bathroom had lots of hot water but shower was in the bath so a little old fashioned. Only problem was some v loud drilling in the afternoons. Normally we wouldn’t be in the hotel then as our sightseeing etc but my daughter wasn’t feeling well one afternoon and came back to rest but with the noise it was impossible. Spoke to manager who said he’d get it stopped but unfortunately it continued and happened again briefly the next day. Prob better for the hotel to state in advance if the are doing Reno work or suggest a room change. That said, I would recommend this hotel for location close to Herald Sq and Times Sq and general service level.

The sofa bed is comfortable for one .It is decorated nicely and on the 12th floor even by the elevator it was really quiet. The bathroom was nice sized and clean. It too was nicely put together. You need a key to use the elevator. Staff was good and concerns were dealt with quickly. Negatives: The desk and small fridge are full with candy and sodas for you to buy. It is not there for you use. There is very little space for your stuff. You would have to clear the desk to use it. The room was cold. The staff tried to address that by coming right up and showing me how to use the thermostat and they gave us two blankets but it remained cooler than we wanted. There is a restaurant but breakfast did not start until 8 on weekends and both days we needed to be somewhere by then. There is a French bakery nearby so ..Once the sofa bed is out, there is no room to open the door. Apparently the wine left on the cluttered desk was complimentary but we weren't told that. Everything else cost a lot for what it was, so we did not take a chance and the desk never told us. They did tell us when asked, that the coffee was free to use and the two water bottles by the bed were complimentary. Small things on the whole, if you get a good deal , I'd recommend the place. Be aware though that they charge a resort fee and the place is not a resort. I guess its for the""complimentary"" WiFi.Why does NYC allow the resort fees. It cuts into their tax revenue.

We had no drawers to store anything for our 5 day trip, just the foot long wardrobe! We arrived late afternoon and there was an odd smell from the bathroom but we were so tired we went to bed.

I went straight down to reception who offered us another room (a suite) but would not be ready until the next day. So we had to sleep again with the ferile stink of god knows what. My husbands birthday stay was ruined. After we moved rooms it was so nice. Loads of storage space and no stench, a little too late.

Room is spotless extremely friendly staff and there’s a coffee shop right on site we hired a car both times to drive us back to the airport it is about 60 dollars which is great because it’s so comfortable and we had extra cases from shopping.

When we got there the booking was only for one of us. We found this a bit strange as in the notes we asked for a high floor room if possible, as we was celebrating an anniversary. They don't do anything for anniversaries either. If you are looking for a hotel with a view, this isn't the hotel for you as a lot of the rooms like ours looked out onto an office block so no view at all. The first morning we went down to breakfast and the breakfast was only for one person. We checked with reception and this couldn't be changed. My advice is to book the hotel without the breakfast, as the buffet is limited in choice and expensive for what it is. There are lots of breakfast places around which are lovely. If you do have breakfast at the hotel go early, as that is when the food is fresh and warm. The restaurant doesn't seem to be part of the hotel. We went down to have a drink, we ordered our drinks and sat on a table. Next minute the restaurant manager said the table was reserved and we was escorted into the lobby, bit strange as no table reserved signs on the table, not a great experience.We asked what the late checkout option was and was told they were only available on the day. The man on reception said they were first come first served. We said we would get up early as we needed a later checkout. We went down to reception on our last day, to be told that the hotel could extend our check out time from 12.00 pm to wait for it 1.00 pm wow. We asked if we could check out at 4pm and was told to do this we would be charged a whole day's rate. Overall there are better hotels for around the same price in the area.

The property is a couple of blocks from NY Penn Station so if you are going to the airport, to a business meeting in Jersey or to Brooklyn, its all very east to get to. Although the Executive is not the most ""posh"" or extravagant hotel in Midtown, for the price, cleanliness and service, why would I stay anywhere else. The rooms are more on the smaller size, but have everything you need...I would recommend the queen or king rooms, as the suites are a bit on the smaller size as well. A few months back, I missed my flight and had to wait till the evening, so I literally worked out of the quiet corner of the lobby most of the day and they were very understanding and let me do what I needed to do.

This would be a terrible choice for 4 adults, it was ok for 1-2 adults and 1 child. The sofabed is very small and tucked in a tiny area (smaller than our bathroom), so you have to exit the bed by climbing out the bottom. They have one of this room type per floor (we say the room on 2 floors) and both were same strange layout.Without telling us in advance, they assigned us to a room with an ADA bathroom. It sucked. A huge empty area in the middle of the bathroom, with a minuscule counter (approx. 4 inches on each side of the sink. All that room and absolutely nowhere to lay down your toiletriesThe very least I have gotten in NYC for my $20+ resort fee (2 $1 bottles of water a day, coffee and GREEN TEA - no real tea, wi-fi).Also, very strange lighting configuration. you could not just have on one bedside lamp. to have a bedside lamp you had to have both bedside lamps, the lighting around the mirror above the desk and track lighting along the tops of the windows in both the bed and sofabed areas.

There are plenty of restaurants nearby and the hotel is within walking distance of Macy’s and the Empire State Building. Despite being close to attractions the street felt quiet and safe at night. We found the reception staff, concierge and doormen to be very helpful and friendly. Particular mention must go to Jamie- nothing was too much trouble for him and he was always there to greet us each day offering advice and suggestions. When he found out my step dad had injured his back, he arranged a later check-out of the room so my stepdad could relax comfortably until he left for his flight. We stayed in an executive suite on the 9th floor. The room was clean and comfortable with a nice separate seating area with TV and sofa. The suite would have been great for 2 or 3 people but with 2 adults and 2 teenagers it was a bit cramped, especially as storage was limited. My mum had a larger room on a higher floor. It would be worth booking one of these if available, for the light, space and view. Breakfast was perfectly acceptable with hot and cold choices at the buffet e.g. fresh fruit, yoghurt, granola, bagels, pastries, sausages, bacon, eggs and potatoes. The bar/dining area where breakfast was served was small but we had no trouble getting a table each morning. In the evenings, the small size of this bar/dining space was limiting as you weren’t allowed to sit at one of the dining tables just to have a drink. There were only a small number of bar stools around the bar to have your drinks there. The limited space also meant that the hotel could not cope with the large number of guests wishing to dine on Xmas Day. This meant that the food and service were not up to the standard you would expect, and some guests like us, ended up having their meals in the small lounge area outside the bar/restaurant. The Xmas Day meal was the only thing which let our trip down especially as my mum ended up being charged for her meal twice. This was rectified by one of the hotel managers in the end but initially the restaurant staff were not very helpful. Overall, this would not put me off staying again.",UK,"MrsBeanUk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>UK</strong>",6,4.0

To start with the location is great, it’s a short walk to the subway and Macy’s, and so it’s very easy to get around and pop back regularly to the hotel to drop off shopping and rest. The room was comfortable and clean, and although we were on a lower floor we were round the back of the building. So while there was no view, it was very quiet which suited us.Unfortunately the cleaning staff took my pajamas along with the bed sheets when our sheets were changed during our stay. Obviously it was unintentional but it was annoying. We asked for their return but eventually the hotel said they likely wouldn’t receive them back from the laundry company until after we’d flown home, so they arranged some compensation to cover the cost of purchasing new pajamas.When I returned home I saw the hotel had put through an unauthorised charge on my credit card of $438.40 which didn’t appear anywhere on our bill. I contacted the hotel and they replied saying it was a ‘computer glitch’. They refunded the money plus an extra amount in compensation to cover the inconvenience and also any currency fluctuations.All in all, the hotel itself was fine.

The hotel is in a perfect location to access most of (if not all) the major tourist sites. It felt safe, and though the downstairs/lounge area is loud (due to restaurant and bar access), our room was quiet. The room was small, but it is what you would expect for NYC given that real estate is at such a premium. We had a room with a queen-size bed and a fold-out couch. The queen-size bed was comfy; the fold-out couch was less comfy. But again, given expected prices, I was not surprised. The two things I noticed that could be improved upon were the plumbing and the carpet. The plumbing kept making a strange noise, and we thought it might have something to do with how the plumbing was connected to the venting??? I have no idea. The noise wasn’t particularly loud but it was fairly constant. Again, this was a really small inconvenience. When I bent down to put on shoes, I noticed the carpet had some old hair on it. Again, most people wouldn’t even notice this, but I was a little grossed out. In general, I wouldn’t hesitate to stay again. One reason we did say anything about the little nuisances was because, at the holidays, I know businesses are busy. My guess is that, had we said anything about the plumbing noise or carpet, the staff probably would have attended to it.","Ithaca, New York","mariadA1991XG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ithaca, New York</strong>",0,4.0

All the staff in the dining area was friendly and accomadating and the food was presented well and was very good.We stayed at the Executive Hotel for two days and have only praise for the staff and management!

The LeSoleil was the best hotel we have stayed in NYC.One reason is that the suite rooms have necessary extra space for spreading out and storing suitcases and bags. Since there are no closets for hanging clothes this was a wonderful “plus”!The bathroom is a great size and the beds and sheets are comfy. Floor to ceiling windows bring in light, and blackout curtains keep room dark in the early morning. Bring ear plugs for street noise. There is a nice desk , mini fridge , coffee maker and we had two televisions. All staff members are extremely amiable and efficient. Concierge, bellmen, front desk, restaurant employees- all provided excellent and friendly service!!!There is a living room area with chairs, couches, and coffee tables. The restaurant serves breakfast, lunch and dinner, and has a full bar.If you “opt for” the breakfast included in your room choice, you will have the same items to eat every day- scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon & sausage, oatmeal, toast & bread, croissants and jams, juices, and fresh fruit. Everything was good, but it would be nice if the eggs were maybe poached with a sauce, over easy, or served omelette style, for a change every few days. We had cocktails and snacks one night before leaving for a 7:00 play, and everything was delicious. Actually the only thing that I did not like during our 5 day stay was the coffee served in the morning. It tasted like burned bean grinds. So harsh that I had to go back to room to get coffee that I could drink.

I'm not someone who has a lot of dispensable income, so this trip was a big deal for me, and Yadira made my mom and I feel like we were VIPs. Every single detail was perfect, from ease of check in, to the room, to the bottle of wine sent to our room for my mom's 70th birthday. Along with the wine was a lovely note, handwritten by Yadira, wishing my mom a happy birthday. We received an upgrade with a beautiful view of the empire state, and the room was wonderful. The treatment we received during our stay was enough to make a life long customer of me and everyone I know. I attended CatCampNYC during that trip and told everyone I saw how amazing this hotel was. When I got home, I told everyone at the cancer center where I work that they need to stay here the next time they're in New York. I truly can't say enough though about what a treasure Yadira is. We had never met before, but she greeted me like family and went way above and beyond to make our stay the best ever. You have a customer for life, and I genuinely feel like I made a friend.

Room was good and a true reflection of what we had seen online when booking.My first issue was with the staff at other times. Our hotel room door was not closing automatically and so we returned one day (having been out all day exploring the city) to find our room open!!! I spoke to someone on the front desk and as well as not being that bothered, they also didn’t act on it, as the following day, it had still not been sorted out. I spoke to someone different the following day and it was eventually resolved.My other issue, was in the bar. We came back after a hot day out in NYC and fancied a drink in the bar whilst it was ‘happy hour’. As the three of us walked in, the young girl seemed confused that we wanted to come and have a drink. We explained we didn’t want a meal, just a nice cold beer and that we were residents of the hotel. We went to sit at a table (which we were initially shown to) and then we were told that we’d be better sitting in the HOTEL LOBBY(!!) as we had our 7 year old with us. What? We are paying over $1600 for 5 nights and I’m pretty sure we’re entitled to sit in the bar (not AT the bar) as a family! We reluctantly went into the lobby whilst my wife bought 2 beers at $5 each, as advertised.....only they weren’t. There was tax on top! A while later (still during ‘happy hour’) they tried to charge us a different amount for a repeat order!!?! Again, after dispute, we paid the original amount. On check out, I was asked if I required an invoice. I said yes and was told one would be emailed out. I supplied my email address at this stage on a Post-It note (??!) and was told it would be sent through. I checked regularly over the coming days and no sign. My wife emailed, I tweeted, but nothing. No response. We eventually called (almost a week later) and we’re told that it had been sent to an email address for my wife...a Yahoo! address that has never existed??! It was then sent to me - whilst on the phone - where I discovered that I had been charged for two items from the mini bar which I hadn’t had. They refunded them, but glad I checked!! Again, this is a staff issue and really poor customer service. Overall, we enjoyed our visit to NYC and the room was fine as a base for this. I just wish the staff cared more and responded to customers requests and needs.

The staff are really quite excellent and housekeeping was immaculate. The room was clean and modern. We had a qeen suite which consisted of a queen bed and a pull out sofa bed for our 15 year old son, separated by a 'two thirds' wall, which afforded us both some degree of privacy. There was a large flat screen tv across from both beds. The room is - for New York - generously sized. The bed and bedding were very comfortable and we slept well, helped by black out curtains. As we were on the 12th floor, the noise from the street (which we faced) was minimal (although it is NY so you expect some noise!). I'd agree with other reviewers regarding lack of hanging space. After getting additional hangers form house keeping we did manage, but only just! Unfortunately we experienced 2 negative issues. The first - which the hotel could do nothing about during our stay - was with the bathroom door, which is a pocket door which slides into the wall. As there is no handle on the door, it's almost impossible to close it properly. You have to slide to close it, but if you slide it with too little force it stays relatively open, and too much force it simply bounces back open! This may be fine if you're single or a couple who don't mind listening to one another in the bathroom... (definitley not us!), but we loathed it and found it a major annoyance. We also had a second, more serious issue around health & safety. However, the hotel management dealt with this well and to our satisfaction, so I won't mention the detail here, other than to say it was a one off and highly unlikley to happen again to another guest. Despite this incident (and our hatred of the bathroom door!), we've given this hotel 4 stars. It would have been 5 stars if the bathroom door was 'normal'!

From the moment we arrived to a warm welcome on reception and a much-needed drink. Initially we were on the 5th floor which was quite noisy (and obviously no view of the city) but we were easily able to upgrade to the 18th floor. From there we had a fantastic view across the skyline (not the empire state side but you can request this). This room was also bigger and seemed to be in a better state of repair, although the room we had on the 5th floor was also very nice. The rooms are a bit of a squeeze for 4 people - in the 5th floor room our kids shared a couch bed (double) but they had to crawl over each other to get to the bathroom. They had more space when we moved rooms. The service was outstandng, from Joseph and the other chap on the door who were always friendly (morning and night!) to the reception staff who spotted our kids needed a rest between moving rooms and arranged for us to use our old room. Lots of little things that made it good - newspapers freely available, well stocked (and reasonably priced) mini bar, nice robe (only one though!), nice bedding, good toiletries in bathroom. Food - we had breakfast included which at the eye watering cost of $25 each I was glad was included. It was good quality food, not a massive selection but enough to have something a bit different each day, They were happy to make me a decaf coffee but you do have to pay extra for cappuccino and (weirdly) breakfast juices (at $6 each!). But there's also loads of places around if you wanted to get a cheaper breakfast. We didn't eat in the restaurant at night but there are so many on your doorstep you are spoilt for choice. Service in here wasn't quite as slick as in the hotel but friendly and warm. Location wise it's spot on - next street is Empire State, Times Square is just round the corner. Subway entrance on the next street. I'd really recommend booking this hotel if you want a good central location.","Preston, United Kingdom","Nicolaca</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Preston, United Kingdom</strong>",3,5.0

She did NOT listen when we tried to explain that she had done a mistake but had such an arrogant attitude, blamed it on ”the system” and also on us! She implied that maybe we had told her college at check in to do both the full amount in cash AND credit?! She was not helpful or nice at all. She was rude!

We were met by Joseph, who took our bags and carried them into the hotel for us, he welcomed us to both the USA and to the hotel, stating that if there was anything that he could do, all we had to do was ask. The check in was very efficient and the staff on the desk were extremely polite and welcoming. I had called ahead a couple of days prior to our visit, explaining that it was my wife's 60th birthday the day after we arrive and could they do something nice for her. We were given a room with a great view (1404) and when we opened the door to the room, there was a nice bottle of wine waiting for us, compliments of the hotel. The room was spotless and very well laid out. There was a mini bar and a tray of goodies (Not complimentary and VERY expensive, so be careful here). There is a bar on the ground floor that has a super atmosphere, just the place to start and end your nights out, again be aware that unless you visit the bar during happy hour (half price) the drinks are, as in the rest of NYC, VERY expensive, $10 for a 330ml can of IPA. Although we never ate in the bar, we met lots of people who did and the only had praise for the food and service. We had no issues at all during our stay and requests for extra water and pillows were completed within 30 mins of asking. Jaime, the head Concierge, was BRILLIANT, he was just the right mix of polite and friendly, thanks Jaime for all your hard work and for sorting both my daughters and our cabs to the airports. OK, here are a couple of things to look out for while in NYC.Make sure that you read the bill properly before just paying it, there is a tipping culture in NYC of between 10 and 25 percent, the vendors will put the tip on the bill under the heading of ""gratuity"", if this is already on the bill, don't feel obliged to also tip in cash. I would politely ask for the tip to be removed from the bill and leave a cash tip for the staff who waited on me, this has two benefits, one is that the person who dealt with your table gets the money and that they don't pay tax on it.Keep your Credit Card in view all all times! My wife's was cloned while we were there and although this was picked up by the bank and the card was cancelled, we luckily had access to other funds that we could draw on while we were there. Top Tip, us a PRE LOADED card, very secure. We had one as a backup, obtained from the Post Office, this turned out to be a life saver.Conclusion:-I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel, it's not cheap, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for!","Preston, United Kingdom","GaryBeale</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Preston, United Kingdom</strong>",94,4.0

You’ll see that this hotel charges you JUST a little bit more than what you originally thought they were going to.In most some cases, it’s not a lot; but it’s just enough to where if they do it to thousands of guests per year, it adds up to nice pile of extra money, without causing too much concern with their customers. I stayed here several times last year, and to be honest, I almost didn’t even notice it, until something unrelated caused me to take a closer look. And yes, it turns out they did this during ALL of my stays.What’s sad about this situation, is that I did everything I could to contact the hotel and discuss this with them. I was hoping for a logical explanation, but sadly no. I received no explanation whatsoever. Management was completely silent, even after I sent multiple inquiries to various different people in management: their GM and Director of Rooms.I am really disappointed by this. I had planned many more trips in the coming year to NYC, but unfortunately, this hotel’s dishonesty has lead me to find other accommodations in the future. At the end of the day, if they’re doing this to me, they’re doing it to thousands of others as well, each and every year. Rest assured, I will never stay at this hotel again.",,travelNYC2018,2,2.0

If I was paying double what I paid, the size of the room, and the lack of storage and closetcloset might have brought it down oneone num.But Its a perfect location and a very nice hotel with an excellent staff. Well decortaed in a traditional style and it feels more permanene than many of the chain hotels that have sprung up in this neighborhood in the past decade. My room was actually quiet-- a wonder in these new built mid town hotel structures. I could hear nothing from the hallways and very little from the street.The room is small, but functional in every way but clothes storage. If the hotel has a fault is the lack of suitable space to unpack. The limited hanging space shares a nook with part of the rooms bar, so unless you're traveling with only halter tops and shorts, your clothes and a waterbottle, two wine glasses and some chips are going to constantly be fighting for the same limited space. I think Yotel, Pod 42nd, Citizen M all manage to do this better in more limited space-- but with less of the very comfortable traditional hotel room that Le Soleil provides. But for just fourfour the storage was nothing more than a mild annoyance. Because the room is comfortable for one person. The shower is great and very well designed. The bed is very comfortable. The wifi worked well. If i'd had someone with me, the space might have been too confined Skip the breakfast buffet, much better and cheaper places close by. I didnt eat any other meals at the restaurant.This is now definitly a hotel I will put on my repeat list.

Special thanks to Choony from housekeeping who helped me to keep the room perfectly organized during my entire stay, including smallest details like - clean towels (properly following the convention - towel on the floor meaning replace, on the hook - leave), litter properly collected and even every time the toilet paper with a cute arrow fold in the end :) Ah, and always the coffee parts properly added so that I could start the day with a smile.

It was a very clean and stylish hotel and the location was outstanding. The only thing I might recommend is having one or two luggage racks in the room as the rooms are quite small and because there really is no closet or drawer space and you’re basically living out of your suitcase, it’s a little inconvenient having your suitcases on the floor. I know small rooms in NYC are not uncommon but this was perhaps the smallest I’ve experienced in my numerous trips to the city. Even with the two racks it will cut into the space to move around quite a bit, but at least it’s more convenient than having to dig through your luggage on the floor. Overall though the staff was very nice and accommodating. I know there isn’t much you can do with small rooms, but hanging and drawer space can be a real necessity, so anything the hotel can do to assist in this manner would be helpful.

Why?1. The staff is fantastic and I mean all of them. From Inna and Andre at the desk to Emilino the bellmen, they are all friendly, attentive, and genuine. 2. New York is a very loud city but the rooms in this hotel are quiet. Very important if you are a light sleeper.3. The beds are super comfortable. I believe most if not all have pillow tops.4. A good portion of their rooms are configured such that the air vent is NOT blowing across the bed. Stay in rooms that end in 02, 04, or 07 if this bothers you.5. The HVAC system is an in-the-wall system, not a free-standing monstrosity. In other words, its quiet. 6. The rooms are modern and well furnished for all types of guests. They are not large but that is NY.Are there areas for improvement? Sure and here are some.1. All of the rooms have an HVAC system that has a infrared motion detector that runs a timer. If it doesn't detect movement after an hour (I think) it turns itself off to conserve energy, which is awful when you are trying to sleep in a room that needs to be climate controlled. I spoke to the head engineer, he said there is no way to turn that feature off. 2. The light switches in the rooms have no rhyme or reason. Some do nothing and none work as you would expect. Many of the lamps have to be turned on/off individually which is a pain. 3. There are plugs with USB ports at the desk which is great but what about near the bed? Every time I stay I have to pull the night table out to plug in my phone charger. Put a plug in the lamp or something like that!Overall I highly recommend this hotel and I hope my review helps you decide!",,Kapilow,2,5.0

Different rooms, different dates but Bernie put it all together. He was so great to work with. The front desk staff were also so easy to get along with. Very engaging and helpful. The restaurant on site was great too. The location of the hotel could not have been better either. We walked uptown, downtown every where. The subway was around the corner for when we went to the Yankees game. We had the queen suite room and it worked very well for us.

The location is excellent, a short walk from Penn Station in midtown. The lobby is lovely, and the rooms are modern and very tastefully done. I have stayed at the chain hotels in the area and they all seem interchangeable -- I can't remember one from the next, but LeSoleil is distinctive and much nicer. The bathroom was roomy and a terry bathrobe was provided, an amenity missing in the chain hotels. A magnifying mirror was also helpful. The staff was friendly and very helpful, and even though I'm very familiar with NYC, the Concierge was eager to direct me to various museum shows on offer, which I greatly appreciated. My room also had a view of the Empire State Building, which was fun. And the windows open a bit, which is great if you want a little fresh air. I didn't try the restaurant, but the menu looks good, especially for breakfast and lunch. The room itself was small. I had to put the telephone on the floor to get more room on the desk, and the Keurig coffee machine took up way too much space on the other side of the desk. Also, there were no bedside electrical outlets, present sometimes in the lamps or next to them in other hotels (fortunately, I had an extension USB cable), and the pocket door of the bathroom was pushed so far into its pocket, I couldn't close it. This latter problem could have been solved by calling the front desk and asking for help, but it wasn't that important in the moment. I will definitely stay there again.

It's a queen suite with a sofa bed, about 400 square feet of space, which in NYC is palatial.View: This room does not face the Empire State Building, but instead has a pleasant northern view of the skyline featuring the Bank of America Tower and a sliver of the MetLife Building.Closet: As others have mentioned, the room does not feature a traditional closet. Instead, they offer an open-air hanging rack with three shelves, three drawers, and a standard customizable-code safe that easily fits a 13.3"" laptop. They also provide a very comfortable robe, slippers, an iron and ironing board, hair dryer, small ice tub, and handy courtesy hotel umbrella.Bed: The mattress was very comfortable and the sheets were soft and welcoming. The pillows are also on the softer side, in case that matters for you.WiFi: The wifi service is available throughout the property and is sufficiently fast. Just be prepared to enter the password every time you go online.Noise: It's great that the windows open so you can get fresh air, but just be prepared for the street noice. That wasn't a big deal for me, since I love those sounds! Also, they wisely placed the bedroom and ""living space"" TVs on an interior dividing wall, so your TV-watching doesn't affect other guests and vice versa.On to the not-so-great, but not-nearly-close-to-deal-breaking issues: - They dropped the ball on providing adequate counter space in the bathroom. The bathroom area is ridiculously spacious. It would have been a simple matter to install a wider sink area or another shelf somewhere. By far, this is the most significant failing of an otherwise great hotel room. - The water pressure in the shower was a bit on the low side, but that just might be a function of being on a high-ish floor. - This could have been a fluke, but *in my view* the food in the restaurant lacked proper seasoning. Not to worry, the world-famous historical NYC landmark, Keens Steakhouse, is just a few steps down the street and is a must-do if you are in the area. Make reservations if you can, otherwise, you can try to get seats in the bar area. Aaron, one of the bartenders/servers is very knowledgeable, acommodating, and helpful. Find him -- you won't be disappointed! Also, Habanero Blues, just across the street, has really great food and drinks. In a nutshell, you're in a great area, try *everything*! - Other reviews mentioned the slow service of the elevators, since the hotel only has two, but I found that I didn't have to wait long for them. I suppose it depends on your expectations.All in all, this a great room in a well-cared for hotel.

After booking we made contact with Yadira at the hotel, to make 2 requests regarding our room which were not met. We were on the 19th floor (1901) and had a view of the empire state building. The bedroom carpet was stained as was the headboard. The curtains and nets also had marks on, something i wouldn't have expected given how long it has been open. Our sitting area had a wall mounted flat screen TV, 1 ikea style chair and a huge glass coffee table.

This was an American continental breakfast which we discovered is run by a COMPLETELY separate company as is all the hotel food, and it is very different to a European version. Breakfast was obtained by producing two of these cards every morning in 'Trademark Taste + Grind', which you access from the small lobby. The voucher entitles you to 3 items... a muffin or a pastry served with a fruit platter or yoghurt with granola and a drink of your choice. On one day we were sat down (in the restaurant) and had placed our order when another table who had placed their order 10 minutes after us received their food. We told the manager that we were not waiting any longer and left. On our last day we walked in to be told that they had 'changed things around a bit'. They were now offering a buffet breakfast, more like a European continental breakfast for $19 each which we could have if we wished to pay. We declined and were told that our breakfast was now being served in the coffee shop but that we were more than welcome to come back in and eat our food in the restaurant! We went through to the coffee shop were we shown our options. Our drinks would have been served in a paper cup, the fruit platter was in a plastic pot (and much less than was on the platter) we never found out how the pastry would have been served!! By this point we had gone to speak to the manager who didn't seem bothered by our position and allowed us to walk out on our last day without a breakfast. Overall we would say that the accommodation was very average and the hotel staff although doing their best could do with further training and direction from the management to make the guests experience seamless as we would expect. If you are happy with no frills accommodation in a good location then the Le Soleil is for you!","Yorkshire, United Kingdom","mrsdb471</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorkshire, United Kingdom</strong>",14,3.0

I researched hotels in the area of MSG that had more of a boutique hotel vibe. Executive Hotel LeSoliel got nice reviews and the restaurant/coffee house next door got rave reviews. So we booked it. The lobby is very attractive and very clean although smallish. It really has an old NY vibe. Approaching the desk we were greeted by Lilly and Musukula..two warm and welcoming women. They treated us like we were old friends or family. What a great start to our stay. The room was on a higher floor which gave us a decent view but insured we didn’t hear any street noise. The room is small(aren’t most NYC rooms small?) but pretty and the space is used well. The bathroom is also spotless and a nice size! We ran up the street to the GingerMan for a quick bite and a couple of drinks and then returned to the hotel to grab our NYR stuff and walked over to MSG. So easy! The bed was very comfortable. In the morning we ended up downstairs in Trademark Taste and Grind. Wow! A hidden gem! Great looking space, the staff was cheerful and attentive and the food was deeeeeeeeelicious. Best avocado toast I’ve had and the coffee is divine. We would have bought a couple of lbs if they sold the beans. When we checked out our friends Musukula and Lilly were there at the desk again! They are great ambassadors for the hotel. Really sweet! We did have one miscommunication with the hotel that was disappointing. The manager on duty Jose came to our room to personally apologize and he was so very nice. Every employee that we met was kind and friendly.. who says New Yorkers are grumpy? Lol. The hotel offered us an upgrade the next time we visit. Unfortunately we don’t really come in to the city to stay over. ( hubby worked there for years and we mostly travel into New England) It was a nice gesture though. I can still say I would recommend this hotel to my friends and family.

I like to stay midtown and my favorite hotels in the past have been the Sofitel and the Iroquois when their rates have been reasonable which for this last trip they were not. I had stayed once before at the Executive Le Soleil in New York and liked it and then at the one in Vancouver which is commendable as well.On this trip I booked through Booking.com an executive suite with view which perfectly met my needs for a total price of USD810.00 including taxes and the tiresome cash grab resort fee of $20.00 a night. The equivalent at Sofitel was USD1300 and USD1100 at the Iroquois.One could say that the more expensive hotels, both on 44th St between 5th and 6th avenue are better situated however The Executive Le Soleil is only eight blocks away on 36th and between 5th and 6th with arguably better amenities than the ancient Iroquois and the not so young and ridiculously expensive Sofitel.The large high floor room I received had a nice view of rooftops and buildings in the distance, an impeccably clean large bathroom, a microwave oven a mini bar fridge that allowed me to store my own stuff (instead of those hateful electronic ones that charge you each time you touch something) and best of all a Kruger coffee machine for your morning coffee. At the Sofitel you have to request one for your room (but it is complimentary and part of that horrid resort fee they don't tell you about) and at the Iroquois you have to trundle down to the lobby to get your coffee as there are no coffee makers in the room.My room also was blessedly quiet at night for sleeping and the bed very comfortable. Surprisingly another bonus was that there were tons of channels on the large HD Television which was fun to flip through in the morning when looking at the news. The hotel WIFI which is included was also very strong and fast. In fact faster than most hotels I have stayed at.The staff I encountered were all charming,professional and diligent.The location of the hotel is two blocks from the Empire State Building and ideal for shopping. Macy's is three minutes away as are a myriad of other great stores. Good restaurants are in abundance in the immediate area. Just up the street from the hotel is A.B. Sushi which serves excellent fresh sushi. The clear seafood soup is to die for as is the Chiarushi and all at very reasonable prices.Also a favorite is Ben's Deli on West 38th between 7th and 8th for fantastic deli food. Their Corned Beef and Pastrami sandwiches are legendary and the coleslaw and pickles that come free to the table out of this world. Going to the theatre district is a ten to twelve minute walk. My only criticism would be to avoid the breakfast at the hotel restaurant Trademark as it is disappointingly overpriced and underserved. There are much better places around (such as couple of doors away) with much better value.Overall I was very happy with my experience and felt that I got good value for my money and shall certainly return.",Ontario,"Loudlyintrepid</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ontario</strong>",382,4.0

I read the reviews and thought the Executive Le Soleil would be a great place to celebrate our 40th Valentines Day together. I booked a city view room and contacted the hotel before hand to ensure an awareness of both the importance and purpose of my stay. Overall, the hotel was clean, rooms were in very good shape and staff were very friendly. The proximity to Times Square favoured nice walks and ease of access to various restaurants and activities. However, be very careful when booking here because there are a few surprises ... First, your room rate will be adjusted. Yes, a mandatory $20 per night ""Amenities Fee"" will be added to your bill. The hotel may advertise competitive nightly rates but they are adjusted upon your arrival. If you are comparing prices, be sure to consider an additional $20 night. Second, the hotel has an odd arrangement with the neighbouring bar. Don't expect to pop into the hotel lounge without a reservation. Believe it or not !! My wife and I returned to the hotel after our Valentines dinner and decided to relax in the hotel lounge (as small as it was) for a night cap before retiring to bed. We sat at one of the open tables in the hotel lounge when immediately a man came rushing through a door from the neighbouring bar and asked if we had reservations. We explained that we were guests of the hotel. The man insisted that all seats in the hotel lounge were reserved by the bar and there were people lined up at the bar next door waiting for them, this quickly proved to be a flagrant lie. I was stunned - I had never encountered this situation in over 40 years of travelling. The man insisted we leave, noting that we might have luck at another bar down the street. Despite being severely embarrassed, we put our coats back on went to our room. As we were leaving, others in the lounge conveyed their surprise that guests of the hotel were asked to leave the hotel lounge to make room for patrons of a neighbouring bar. We quickly noted our experience to the front desk and the door man. Each of whom were essentially unresponsive to our dilemma. The next morning I brought my concern to the front desk once again. I was advised that the manager would be advised, again no further action was taken. During checkout, I raised the matter once again and was advised I might get a call from the hotel manager. Net/net, we were guests of the hotel and were ordered to leave the lounge so that the neighbouring bar could make a few extra bucks. I brought my concern to numerous hotel staff, no one took either an interest or an action. In fact, the manager did not even take two minutes to come to the front desk and discuss my concern - disgusting customer service !!! Ironically, the surprise ""amenities"" fee apparently does not include the hotel lounge. Despite this hotel having excellent potential, the hidden charges and complete lack of interest of the hotel management to engage ""customer service"" situations does truly tarnish the reputation of this hotel. Despite all the ""Customer Service"" media, be very cautious of booking a stay. Very sad .., one of the worst examples of customer service failures I have seen in over 40 years !!! The complete disregard to customers essentially ruined a milestone 40th Valentines Day for my wife and I. Sadly, not one person at the hotel took an interest in my concern. Fortunately, social media provides an excellent mechanism for sharing these types of experiences to safeguard the risk of others falling victim to the same predicament.",,Jim K,28,2.0

After travelling for nearly 30 hours from Melbourne we were very tired on arrival. The welcome was less than friendly, and strangely I was asked to sign the check in details on an iPad with very small print that was difficult to read. The Decollette Suite is lovely. There is a very large living/dining/kitchen area, and reasonably sized bedroom and a bathroom with a shower but no bath, although as others have said the shower pressure is poor. Unfortunately, the noise from the mechanical services on the roof is so loud that it was very difficult to sleep. At first we thought it was the fan on the air conditioner and asked at the reception desk the next morning whether they could see if they could do anything to reduce the noise. Later the same day I complained again, and the nice young man on reception sent someone up to the room to have a look/listen. He immediately acknowledged the noise in the living room and we asked him to go into the bedroom where it is soooo much louder. He said he would speak to someone to see what could be done.On our way out the next morning, after a second night with little sleep, I enquired at reception as to whether anything could be done about the noise. We were asked to take a seat and the manager, Jose, came to speak with us. He explained that the noise was caused by the mechanical services on the roof and that nothing could be done. He offered to move us to another room, but without a kitchen or to leave with no cancellation penalty. As we had theatre tickets that night we stayed a third night, and then moved to another hotel on New Years Eve at a very inflated price, for one night, before moving to an apartment hotel. The Decollette Suite is not cheap. It is disappointing that it is offered at all, and that it took three enquiries at reception before the noise problem, that the hotel is clearly aware of, was acknowledged. We were very sorry to have to leave this hotel as it is very well located in Midtown just south of Times Square, close to Macy’s and walking distance to the theatres.","Ashburton, Australia","favourites</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ashburton, Australia</strong>",90,3.0

It’s not too big if its just standard room but enough to fit yourself and your baggage. Perfect room size for a queen room with view but too big if you are staying solo. Almost all is excellent, from staff to rooms to location. It’s superb! Only few lookouts for management to improve or just for them to highlight 1) Bedroom slippers is not available when we arrive. We have to request to have one. 2) There is no pen but there is a pad paper . 3) We tried to call the reception to ask where to get ice but no one answered even if its just past 10PM. We had to visit lobby and ask personally 4) Table lampshade (the one near the TV) is not working. 5) Window light switch is connected to the bedside light which is also connected to the clock/iphone docking. So if I switch it off, the clock turns off as well. Other than that, everything is excellent. You can charge your cellphone and GoPro directly from the USB socket. No need for adaptors! There is an umbrella ☔️. Microwave and complete tablewares is available for your use at Queen Room with view (1601). Pillows are wow soft. Many television channels to choose from. Huge bathroom.

The hotel is located in the Garment district-a great location if you want to venture north and south In Manhattan during your stay. It is an easy walk to great restaurants in Korea Town, the Empire State Building, and Times Square, but on a quieter street. The staff was amazing-truly the heart of the hotel. They were helpful, responsive, and polite. The only negative I will note is room size . I selected this hotel in part because they have queen size beds and we are a family of 4. Yes, the beds are queen size, but there is NO closet or space to put even one suitcase (let alone 4). There is an open rack/ desk unit that has a tiny space to hang items and a couple of tiny drawers. The beds are relatively comfortable and the bathroom is sufficient. I have traveled extensively in Europe and had read reviews that the rooms at Executive are “European size”. I can tell you that the room was among the smallest in which I have stayed, and the lack of closet/floor space makes the room smaller. My recommendation is that they remove the desk/mini fridge unit and add a closet. In hindsight we probably should have gotten two rooms, but with the room cost at close to $500/night during the holiday that really was not a consideration. I certainly would stay at this hotel again-just not with the whole family.","Cincinnati, Ohio","marybZ8024ZL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cincinnati, Ohio</strong>",19,4.0

Let's start with the good - the lobby looked very nice upon check-in, with a cozy lounge area and fireplace, and on-site restaurant that I would have taken advantage of if we were staying longer. Check in and check out was very quick. We had a view that showed us the top of the empire state building, which was pretty cool. Street noise was loud but we were high enough that it didn't bother us with the windows closed. Beds were reasonable comfortable. Staff was friendly, I can't complain about them personally, but the overall execution of service was just not good. For starters, we get to the room and my first reaction is ""oh it's tiny, but at least it's clean."" Wrong. I go into the bathroom to wash up and there are tiny flies zipping around the bathroom around the sink, shower and toilet. Then I notice the walls are full of dark scuff marks like someone walked on the walls in their snow boots. There are splash marks on the wall by the sink, and worst of all, a brown stain on the sheets. I called the front desk to alert them of the problem and I'm told he'll call me back once he ""shuffles things around."" I thought that meant we're getting another room, but instead the maid came to change the sheets and someone threw a chlorine tablet down the shower drain (did nothing, we dealt with the flies the rest of our stay). And no, the front desk never called us back. Then there were other small details that would not have bothered me or been worth mentioning had the room been in good clean condition. For example, there was only one umbrella and one bathrobe in a room occupied by two people. The Keurig had only coffee, no tea. Two of our towels were tattered at the edges. The room was so tiny that if one person was sitting at the desk, the other person had to climb over the bed. The bathroom was 1/3 of the entire room, which seemed like a completely unnecessary configuration as I'd rather be able to walk comfortably around the sleeping area than have a dance party in the bathroom.

The ""coat rack"" has enough room for the 2 robes supplied by the hotel, plus one overcoat. That's it. The door to the bathroom is a sliding door intended to save space. The problem is that the door gets sticky as it closes and there is nothing to grip. The bathroom itself has just about no room for setting anything down. Finally, there is no service elevator, so nearly every time we used the elevator a service person was trying to get on with a cart or something else.

The Hotel Soleil certainly provided excellent value at its price point, not quite luxury, but very comfortable and well appointed. While West 36th is not a tony address, it is very convenient for many business and tourist venues. Staying on a high floor, it is rather quiet, which is a big plus in Manhattan.The public areas, and the rooms are tasteful if generic. Quality beds, bedding and toiletries are a plus, although soaps designed in Italy and made in China and a room devoid of art work except for one vapid wall hanging in the bathroom are not endearing. :Free wi-fi"" is included, but there is a dubious $20 Service Charge which purports to cover that, storing luggage before and after your stay and various other sundries. Why is offering free Dasani water such a big perk when NYC has (or did) some of the best tap water in the country?The staff are cheerful and casual. Breakfast in their dining room was workmanlike if not exemplary. Fast and modern elevators are a distinct plus. From the high floors, you might have a nice view of the Empiure State Building.There are perhaps half a dozen mid range hotels on this somewhat scruffy but safe block. This is probably the best of the lot. Unpretentious, clean and modern, it is a good re-purposing of an old office building.

We didn't eat in their attached restaurant but the menu looked appealing. The fireplace, sofa's and chairs in the common lounge area adjacent to the front desk offered a great location on Thanksgiving Day to come warm up after watching the parade for a couple hours. It was the only cold day during our stay. There's plenty of pubs & restaurants to choose from within a block radius of the hotel. The access to and from LaGuardia Airport was good given the access through the Queens Midtown tunnel.

So we had to request additional pillows, glasses, mugs, tea pods, bottled water etc as only 2 of everything was provided. - Sofabed needs a better matress or the hotel should provide a mattress topper when the room is booked for 3 or more people. - No lighting at the sofabed end of the room besides a table lamp which had to be unplugged and moved by us to another part of the room in order to open out the sofabed. - sliding door to bathroom was exceptionally hard to use, it didnt glide smoothly on the tracks it was very stiff to pull across and there were no handles which made the task even harder. This meant the door couldn't be closed properly, not great with 3 of us in the room. We reported this and were informed it couldn't be fixed without cutting chunks of plasterboard out of the wall. No attempt to squirt WD40 to see if that would help. So if we wanted to try and get the door nearly closed this required several attepts each time. Once the door was nearly closed the person inside was in effect trapped unless assistance from someone on the other side of the door was provided. This also resulted in multiple broken nails (ladies :-/). Not great! As the door could only be 'nearly closed' we resorted to going to the hotels public restroom on level C.Tip: - avoid room 403 if you want to be able to close your bathroom door / not be trapped in the bathroom. - Check out Eaterly near thr Flatiron fabulous italian food.

They tried to create a modern look for a bathroom, but forgot to finish small details, such as: molding: there is a spot right next to the entrance of the show where a piece of metal sticking out. If you didn't see it, you can cut your foot/leg pretty badly. Then, they used a glass panel (instead of show curtain), which looks very modern. But, once again, it wasn't secured properly.

It was obviously clean, the staff were extremely first rate and helpful with a Concierge service that surpasses larger hotels and larger brand (names).

I can be a pretty picky guy when it comes to stuff like room cleanliness and can tell you that the cleaning and room maintenance staff here are trained very well. Our room offered a small living room type area which was perfect to set my boy at and watch TV, while I prepared my client list and agenda on the desk.The WIFi at the facility is exactly what you would expect a for a Hotel that caters to business people. It was working, reliable and fast. - This is important these days.. obviously. The food - now I honestly cant say while writing this what we had to eat there. I've been to so many hotels in the past two months and have seen so much that I just cant recall a single thing.. BUT I do recall this. It was fair, and it was good. I remember accepting that it would be a little more expensive then an outside restaurant - but again that is expected. If the food was bad, THAT I would have remembered ! . If you are running on a budget , the good thing is that this place has DOZENS of great dining spots and a market all within walking distance. Now, walking distance .. How's the Empire State for you ?

The hotel is very nice. Like other reviews the closet space was almost non-existent and the bed wasn't as comfortable as I would have liked. My son bunked on the pull out sofa bed while my husband and I shared what seemed like a full size bed. The bathroom had great space and the shower was nice. We didn't visit the bar or restaurant due to all of the other local temptations. From what we are told this hotel has much more room space than others. We stayed in room 705 right by the elevator and never heard any loud noise from other guests coming or going. We stayed here from 6/10 to 6/16 and never had a bad experience here....NEVER! The hotel is located in a great spot close to shopping, a block away from the Empire State Building, a few blocks from Times Square, and the subway station is a block away.

We were able to be re-booked and walked over a mile in busy NYC foot traffic to make it to the new hotel. So when we arrived we were frustrated and exhausted, but this quickly changed as soon as we met the staff. The staff at this hotel were beyond friendly and extremely helpful. They advised us on which trains to take to our destinations around the city and happily answered any questions we had. The rooms were beautiful. This is boutique hotel so the rooms are a little smaller than what might be expected but had all the amenities and a fabulous bathroom. The location of the hotel was perfect. Located in the fashion district, it was within a few blocks of Penn Station for easy train access and just around the corner from the Empire State Building. We went to multiple Broadway shows while we were in town and it was an easy walk there as well. We were close enough to Times Square to enjoy the atmosphere but far enough away to have some peace.

Booking, checking in and out was fast and efficient. Prices are more than reasonable for the location. and speaking of location, this hotel is in the heart of everything and you can explore by foot, or via the next door subway station, all the attractions. The restaurant has good verity of dishes but it is on the expensive side. There are many options around the hotel as alternative.The only problem I had was with housekeeping. At least once I came back to the room around 5pm and it was still not made up, and in many other cases, bathroom and coffee machine stocks were not replenished. Every time I called, there was no answer at housekeeping and I had to call front desk for help. That would definitely prompt me to give this hotel only 4 stars, but ""It's not how we make mistakes, but how we correct them that defines us"" and as such, in all cases, they rectified the problem within minutes and for that they deserve 5 stars.

That shows in the dimensions of the room and bath, which are larger than what is found in many Manhattan hotels.

Central park, The Met, Guggenheim, Statue of Liberty / Ellis Island, Bronze Bull, 9/11 Memorial Pools, Wall St, Federal Reserve & Brooklyn Bridge however should be accessed via the subway once you work out its intricacies. The hotel comprise a rebuild from a gutted former building and is modern and comfortable with good service from the main desk and the room attendants with the rooms being spotless as you would expect. Our room was a queen room on a top level floor with a view merely across the street to the buildings opposite. It certainly was not a basic room. However the room was small with a free standing cloths rack, desk and only one luggage stand. We had two large suitcases plus two cabin bags so there was insufficient room for us to easily walk from the bed to the bathroom without tripping over obstacles, particularly without a light in the middle of the night. The hotel has a restaurant which appears to be run by a chain. However the menu didn't interest us and for the five nights there we dined across the road at the Keg (Irish Pub) which was excellent. We had intended dining out at least one night up market but after tiring days roaming around New York and with the cold rainy weather it was too easy to simply cross the road. What most persons would like to know is would I stay there again. The answer can only be a maybe given the size of the room. It always comes down to you get what you pay for. We paid US$1,147 for five nights and some might say that we got a real good deal and should be happy even if the room was small. Maybe so.

The Suites are not large, but they are most pleasant and aesthetic. Mine had a small sitting room with flatscreen TV, a hall leading to the bedroom, and in between, a nice bathroom with glass enclosed rainfall shower and a counter with plenty of room for toiletries. The bed is clean and comfy with silky cotton sheets and another nice flat screen TV is centered in front of the queen bed. I spent some time in the evenings watching movies when I was tired. The rooms are touted as soundproof, and they are, and the windows are well insulated when closed. My bedroom was situated in the back of the suite, so I could not hear interior noise like doors banging and elevators. I found the quiet aesthetic atmosphere most relaxing, even though I was facing West 36th Street...it was not at all noisy.  There are many hotels on these streets near Herald Square stuck in between older, spacious NY loft and apartment buildings, but this is one that truly works for the guest!! It is thoughtfully designed, the room has glass shelves and closet, a desk with large mirror and great coffee machine, everything works.The staff is friendly and helpful, the concierge(s) were terrific, and someone is usually watching the front door which is good for one's feeling of security. You use your key card for the elevator. There is a nice restaurant and a small cafe adjoining the hotel if you want to stay in and eat, but there are lots of places around Herald Square. I could have stayed longer and felt comfortable at Hotel Soleil! The only suggestions I have for the hotel are about their duvet covers. They use two sheets for this, and because the sheets are silky, they fall off the comforter. Since most hotels do not launder comforters between each guest, it would be much better if the hotel got some duvet covers that cover the quilt completely, especially at the top. Most hotels use these now, around the world. My other suggestion is about the in-room safe..... which was too small for a 15-inch laptop but ok for an iPad or tablet. I think a bigger safe would work better for electronics and papers for most guests.

We did go up one level from the budget room to get a little space but if we had gotten the less expensive room I think we would have been happy. Unlike some of the other rooms we've stayed in, there's plenty of room to get around the bed without bruising your legs, also plenty of room to stash suitcases and clothes and the bathroom was very spacious. The decor was update and the room was very clean. And it was surprisingly quiet; we were right across from the elevator so worried it would be noisy, but it wasn't.  Another plus: it's a short 4-block walk from Penn Station so nice not to have to use a cab or subway to get to/from hotel. Service, though, could be improved a lot. The cleaning staff was incredibly friendly but the reception staff was not only cold, but rarely around. We rarely saw anyone in the lobby to ask questions or even hold the door open and the only person we ever saw at the reception desk to check in and out was efficient but not particularly friendly or helpful. With a little more attention to service and some other simple amenities (like fresh flowers in the lobby, along with perhaps coffee or ice water), this could easily be a 5-star hotel. Oh, but first, the hotel needs to fix its elevators--which requires a room key to operate. That's fine, as long as you don't hop on the elevator (or someone else does) at last minute, wave your key card and end up erasing all previously inputted floors.","Arlington, Virginia","vatravelingbug</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",135,4.0

Stayed here early Feb 17 for 10 nights, I received a helpful email before we even arrived and check in was easy and fast. Which was appreciated after the 30hrs of travel from Australia. Our room was clean, neat and everything seemed reasonably new. Although not a large room it was bigger than I had expected for NY and was spacious enough for all our luggage. However not a lot of wardrobe space. The bathroom was clean and a decent size. We were on the 18th floor and had a great view of the Empire State building and the One World building. It was also a quiet room (not sure if that was cause of the height, not sure if a lower room would have been as quiet). Free wifi and the room had aircon/heating which was easy to use. The housekeeping were efficient and managed to clean our room every day even when we had irregular hours. All the staff we encountered were friendly, professional and helpful. The gym is small, but has everything you needed. The restaurant attached Trademark has nice coffee and we only ate there once but the food was very nice. No room service which is a shame when you are tired, but when in NY you should probably eat out, so it was only and issue for a bit and then I got over it. The location was great, walking distance to many attractions. Check out was easy and fast. I’d read a few reviews earlier that had said they had had some issues after check out when they had returned to collect their luggage it had taken too long and you don’t want that when you are on your way to the airport, so I was a little nervous. But the hotel has fixed this issue. The staff member who helped us (wish I had grabbed a name) was switched on, fast and friendly. He was there to take our bags as we were checking out, took a time we would want them and helped us order a car service. All and all a very positive experience. I would recommend this hotel and will probably stay there again in the future.","Perth, Australia","SammLC91</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",0,5.0

We were on the 15th floor with an outstanding view of the Empire State Building, the room managed to blend functionality with comfort and all done in a tasteful fashion and spotlessly clean. There are only 8 rooms on a floor so it was very quiet.The bed was extremely comfortable. The wardrobe and storage facilities were first class and elegantly put together, combining boutique modernism with practicality and pleasing aesthetic. It was also a bonus to have a seperate kitchen area.What struck us most about the room was the size. Most hotels in NY struggle with their bedroom size and can be claustraphobic. The LeSoleil had so much space and room. A kitchen area with floor space for luggage, bags, coats etc, then a seperate bedroom area with subtle lighting and space to relax and finally a large bathroom, with a window!!!!! Not only a window but an amazing view of the new World Trade Centre.Great choice of TV channels too!It was a real treat to come back to the room at the end of a busy day and take some time to relax in a haven of peace before heading back out for the New York nightlife.

When we arrived, we were first told to pay a deposit of 400 €. I was told this was customary in New York. The problem with a deposition is that it will take up to a week after you left the hotel before the money is released. I have been to New York many times during the last 25 years without having to pay a deposit. Confirm a credit card number yes. Perhaps the reason is that most of my trips have been in my job and were booked through an agency. I couldn’t remember anything about a deposit in the confirmation we got when we made the booking in June. When I asked what the 400 € was for we were told it was for any damage to the room made by us. It was not he money itself. It was more the lack of information in the reservation process that annoyed me.When we came into the room it was also much smaller than expected.

And to my surprise there was nothing about room size and at the bottom of the confirmation it was stated that we must pay a deposit of 100 € a day or 700 €. On Hotels.com there was now no information about room size. We booked this hotel because the room was of fair size. We must work for some hours even when on vacation. We own a small company that needs some TLC every day. Therefore, the room can’t be too small. We need at least one desk with a chair and an armchair to be able use our laptops. This room was approximately 19 sqm. or 210 sqf. The start of our week in New York wasn’t the best. But it improved. A couple of days later I searched for the first confirmation from Hotels.com. And in that it was clearly stated that we had a booked a room that was 28 sqm. And nothing about a deposit. I told that to the front desk and they promised to look into it. When I came back to room there was a mail from Hotels.com asking about of our first experience with the hotel. I briefly told them about the disappointing room size. I guess it was not the hotel that had misinformed us, it was Hotels.com. But the hotel management reacted promptly. The next day we got a room that was of the expected size. The first room was small but it was like a Swiss army knife. It had all but in a small size. You only had to accept to move around yourself and the luggage as in a slide game. Everything from the air-condition, that it is necessary in such small rom even when it was below zero outside, to the rather large bathroom worked very well. Some small details that we appreciated. A real door to the bathroom, not a glass wall as in the W Hotel at Times Square, an iPhone charger, a coffee machine with decent coffee and a shower you could understand how to maneuver without being an engineer. We are both trained engineers (nuclear and building) but we often have problems with showers in European and some Asian hotels. And a small but very good detail. If you must go to the bathroom during the night you are often blinded by the sharp light in the bathroom. It makes it difficult to find your way back to the bed, even in a small room, without hitting the wrong things or waking up your partner. Here the electrical sockets in the bathroom were equipped with a very small light that was sufficient for doing what you came for and it didn’t ruin your night vision. The room we changed to was also nice and had the size we needed. A small remark though. It had a small extra room with a sofa. I would had been nice with a small table there for drinks or food. The air condition system in the larger room didn’t work very well but they fixed it. Both rooms had wonderful views. The Wi-Fi in both rooms worked perfectly. No complicated log-on routines and enough and speed both down- and upstream. We travel with 2 computers, 2 iPads an and three iPhone that must be in sync. It was a blessing after staying in some German hotels as Steigenberger during the autumn were everything is very complicated and Wi-Fi is almost nonexistence.We didn’t have any breakfast at the hotel since we wanted try out different places each morning. There are so many small establishments serving breakfast near the hotel I don’t think we did found them all during our stay. On some evenings, we had to work late in the room instead of going out for dinner. It was very easy to find places near the hotel where we could buy a couple of sandwiches even at midnight. If it had been small table in the room, we might have considered food from room service. But now having a sandwich was the easiest solution. We had wine in the bar one evening. Wine is very expensive in New York even compared with Sweden where we come from. But both the bar and the wine were nice so it is only to accept.The staff was friendly and professional. The location is perfect. Near at least two subway lines, a lot of restaurants of all kinds, more shops than you need and in walking distance of all the sights in Midtown. It is an also good starting point for longer walks to for example having lunch at Sylvia’s on 125 st. or to Chelsea Market along The High Line. After some misunderstandings at the beginning of our stay we liked the hotel. We will probably choose Executive Hotel LeSoleil next time in New York.","Malmo, Sweden","AndersB168</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Malmo, Sweden</strong>",70,4.0

Was very fortunate to have had a larger sized room, which provided for all that extra space..when traveling not so lightly. Room had a very comfy bed, with an average sized modern bathroom (rainfall shower) and a great lounge space with TV. Found the housekeeping team to be very nice, and really appreciated the nice notes that were left each day after they had visited and serviced the room. Equally impressive were the two gentleman on the door; both of whom were friendly and attentive at all times. The only issue I had with the hotel was the gentleman at concierge, who seemed to be lacking a screw..or as one would say "" had a loose screw"". At each time my partner and I passed by his little booth he was deeply fixated on texting or seemed to be showing a great disinterest in helping the heavy flow of hotel traffic; whether it be smiling or lending a hand holding/opening a door..he was rather inactive. At one stage I did see a lady with a few heavy suitcases trying to grapple her bags and hold the door open all at once.. and he seemed to be far more interested in texting (may have been on Tinder- who knows) then to throw an arm out and help her. I do realize it may have not been in his job description but certainly when you are sitting in a concierge booth 3 feet from the main door..you send a strong first/last impression when guests enter and leave. I have only made mention of this gentleman after reading previous reviews that like mine draw attention to the exceptional service that this man ""brings"" to the table.........All in all, I would certainly recommend Paul and the team's premises to any traveller. It's situated in a great location, presents as a very clean and modern hotel and delivers in regards to providing for an enjoyable base in the big apple.","Melbourne, Victoria, Australia","EdG90</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Victoria, Australia</strong>",17,5.0

Having researched many hotels and having previously stayed in Times Sq, the location of the Le Soleil was perfect, it is located between 5th & 6th Ave, around the corner from Empire State and Macys and was extremely quiet despite being centrally located within the heart of Manhattan. First of all, the staff here are lovely, always offering a smile. In particular, Eddie was a gem, imparting his local knowledge of places to eat, and Chris on reception always friendly and with a permanent smile. I feel that you always get the best out of people by treating them with respect, they do an outstanding job in what can probably be at times, quite challenging, trying to appease people who must have nothing better to do than moan.Our bedroom (we booked the Elan Suite) suited us perfectly. It has 2 bedrooms and is located on the 20th floor overlooking 36th Street. Yes, it perhaps could benefit from a few more hooks and shelves in the bathroom but there was nothing that detracted the overall enjoyment of our holiday. The room was warm (it was extremely cold during our visit), clean and comfortable, what more could you ask for. The rate paid was in line with NY standards, this is a popular and expensive destination and therefore hotel prices have to reflect this. Upon our departure, Eddie organised a car to take us back to JFK which although slightly dearer than a yellow cab (only about $10), it was well worth it. Had I known, I would have contacted the hotel before our arrival to arrange this from JFK as the journey was far more comfortable going back than it was coming.Overall, we had a wonderful stay, the staff do a excellent job and I would not hesitate to stay here again.","Cumbria, United Kingdom","miss_schnapps</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cumbria, United Kingdom</strong>",9,5.0

That one had a very fancy lobby and much sharper interiors in the common areas; however the rooms themselves were tired, a little grubby and very unloved. The reason I mention this as it was impossible not to compare the two hotels when we arrived on 9th December this year at LeSoleil. The street itself is quieter but so close to Macy's so a fab location. It's a much lower-key hotel, the lobby is quite unassuming and underwhelming but still warm and inviting.The bedroom was located on the opposite side to the street so was very quiet, no outside noise whatsoever. You can see the Empire State building out of the window (although it's not quite the 'city view' to get carried away with). The room was tiny. Much more suited to a business trip for one person (in hindsight we should have asked for a larger room with all our luggage but couldn't be bothered!). It was definitely a squeeze but the amenities were brand new, very clean and modern. The bathroom (shower particularly!) was wonderful after a long day sight-seeing (although the door to it slides rather than opens and was quite noisy sometimes).On the whole, the staff were helpful and friendly. We weren't pleased that arriving back on our first day at 4pm that the room had not been serviced so made this known to reception. There were no issues after that and they gave us 10 dollars each off breakfast the next day.The main thing I liked about this hotel (as it's a major bugbear of mine) was how quiet it was. The room doors were soft closing (how does every hotel not have those! What's worse than hearing slamming doors all day/night?!) and there aren't many rooms per floor so noise is minimal.I would visit again as overall we had a very pleasant stay!","Stevenage, United Kingdom","ems27289</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stevenage, United Kingdom</strong>",2,4.0

We researched many hotel options the city has to offer and decided on Executive Hotel LeSoleil. We were not disappointed! The hotel is beautiful, modern and staffed by welcoming, friendly individuals who seem to enjoy their jobs and are attentive to guests. The fireplace room next to the lobby was cozy and beautifully decorated for Christmas and a wonderful place to enjoy a morning cup of delicious coffee from Trademark Grind, located adjacent to the hotel. Our family (2 adults, 2 adult children) stayed 4 nights in room 1604 and had a lovely view of the MetLife building. The room didn't have much storage area or a closet, but we were fine living out of suitcases for a few days. Nice tolietries, bathrobes, Keurig coffee machine and the mini bar were nice additions, as was the very spacious bathroom. The bed, pillows and linens were very comfortable and very welcoming after long days walking throughout the city. The location was fantastic! We walked to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Central Park, Trump Tower and shopping on 5th Avenue. Easy subway access is close by at 34th St/Herald Square. We had considered spending more for a hotel in Times Square, but after visiting that area, we were happy we had chosen Executive Hotel LeSoleil instead. We found it to be close to everything, but less chaotic and crowded than Times Square. It felt more like coming home to a comfortable, relaxing place-a nice respite from the busy world of the city, crowds and holiday season. We enjoyed great NY pizza from several nearby restaurants, donuts at Planet Donut and pastries from Ferrara's Italian Bakery & Cafe. We ate at the Keg Room across the street from the hotel, and while it might be fine for drinks, I would not recommend it for dinner. Mediocre food and extremely poor customer service from our server. I wish we would have opted for the hotel restaurant instead. We found Executive Hotel LeSoleil exceeded our expectations and would highly recommend it, especially to first time NYC visitors who are not familiar with the area.

I waited for over a week to hear from them before I wrote this review. Seems they just don’t care.Please read all that happened, and decide for yourself if you think staying at this hotel is worth the risk. We booked this hotel based on the good reviews and location.The room originally assigned to us was so small. As soon as I walked in, I wanted to cry. After talking to the front desk, we were assigned a new room, 1201. It was the same room, but with an extra sitting room added. The sitting area only had ONE chair for one person, so we used the area for our luggage and clothes. There is not a closet, but a rack and only enough room and hangers to hang coats so we unfortunately had to live out of our suitcases for three days. The room was nothing exciting. The bath layout was nice. The room needed hooks or other options for your clothing. The view was an office building directly across, you could see people working inside.We got a good night’s sleep, it was very quiet there. After showering in the morning, I could not find the hairdryer. So I had to call for one, a little inconvenience, but nothing major.Saturday morning, before we left for the day, we put the dirty towels on the floor as directed by the sign in the bathroom. We got back to our room around 3:00 pm to get ready to go out for the evening and left again around 5 pm. We got back to our room around 11:30 pm, and our room had NOT been cleaned or refreshed! We called the front desk. No one answered, so I went down. Aida said that she was sorry and would send someone up with towels, shampoo and coffee. She offered me tickets for a free breakfast. I didn’t accept the tickets as we wouldn’t have time in the morning. She asked when we were leaving and I told her around 10. She said breakfast started at 8. But she didn’t understand that we didn’t want to take the time out for breakfast before we left on our seven hour drive. Aida then offered us $50 off for the night. I said that was fine. I was just tired, wanted a shower and needed towels, shampoo and coffee. I went back up to the room and we waited for 30 minutes, and NO ONE came with our supplies. My husband called back down to the desk and we were told it was on it’s way up to us. Five or so minutes, a man came to the door with a very nice and “sincere” apology saying he forgot. He handed the items to my husband and left. My husband put the towels on the bed. There were three towels, no wash cloths or hand towels and one towel was dirty or stained! Wrapped in the towels were at least 5 coffee packs and NO shampoo! I was so upset, I went to bed and left in the morning without a shower.At check out we met Chris. I told him what had happened and handed him the towel. I also told him about the mug and how we never did get any shampoo. I asked for the Manager but he said she would not arrive until 10. It was about 9 am and we wanted to leave. He could tell I was upset and I was trying to be as nice as possible. He politely only charged us for two nights. This was a vacation that we had been looking forward to for months. It is far from a Luxury Hotel as advertised. This hotel did not meet our expectations of an upscale boutique hotel. I understand that people aren’t perfect, jobs are hard, especially working in the hotel industry. But this was unacceptable. Inoel, Kevin, Lilly, Aida and Chris were super nice! They were professional, friendly and seemed to take their jobs very seriously and I wish them success and happiness. They would be a great asset to any fine hotel. To sum it up, the ball was dropped in housekeeping. Dirty towels, dirty rooms, garbage not removed, mugs washed in the room and neglect to replenish the guest’s amenities, guests coming back to their rooms in the evening to an untouched room, are too important to be neglected. I was told that the hotel policy was for the used glasses and mugs to be washed in the dishwasher.Do you want to come back to your hotel room at 11:30 at night to a dirty room, live out of your suitcase, sleep with garbage and use mugs and glasses that are washed out in the bathroom after the last guest? Not what you would expect at a hotel at this price. Not what one would expect at $3-400 a night! Sure, I'm glad I only had to pay for two nights. But it still wasn't worth it and spoiled a big part of my vacation.. And NO apology or explanation from management. Next time, we're going back to a Kimpton Hotel.","Akron, Ohio","TONYandMIMI</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Akron, Ohio</strong>",24,2.0

After much searching on the web we found Le Soliel and booked our room for 3 December nights.We arrived in the evening and were warmly greeted. Upon check in the type of room we had booked wasn't available so Guest services rep Chris Pro moved us up a couple of floors, And in NYC the higher your room the better your view. While our view was decent it was on the opposite side of the Empire State Building. So I went down and asked Chris if we could move the next day. He assured me a room with a nicer view for our final 2 nights. When I went to the desk in the morning Chris and Luis made sure that I knew the room number of our new room (1701 highly recommended) and asked me to have our things ready to be moved before we left for the day. We returned to our new room with all of our luggage in place and had a wonderful view of the ESB. These guys went above and beyond to please us!Oh and the room was comfortable, in a great location as far as food, transportation, convenience stores and site seeing.

This was our first trip to NYC and we loved this hotel and the staff. The room was very nice and spacious. We had a Queen Suite w/View which had a small sitting area included with a 2nd TV. The only negative about this area is that I wish they would have had a small love seat or chair with ottoman. They had 2 chairs which were like large versions of a dining room chair. We didn't spend that much time in our room so it wasn't an issue. I used it as an area for our suitcases and changing clothes. There were floor to ceiling windows which were nice. The view was OK, We weren't facing any landmark buildings. We were in a corner room and there were 8 rooms per floor I believe. The hotel was nice and quiet. We were on the 17th Floor and facing the east. The hotel is on 36th and 6th which was a great location for us in Midtown. Close to shopping and other attractions. We walked a lot and it was great. Far enough from the bright lights and noise of Times Square. I will say there is not much room to hang clothes at all. Bring things that you can leave in your suitcase. There was a mini bar and refrigerator in the room. I'd recommend buying your own beverages and keeping them in the room. The 1 liter Smart Water from the hotel is $8/bottle. There is a CVS just a few blocks away and we bought water from there during our stay.I was a little nervous about coming to NYC for the first time. We flew into LaGuardia and I arranged a private shuttle to and from the airport for our stay through the hotel. Total cost was $130. The first shuttle was an older van which was quite old. The shuttle back to the airport was nicer. I will say that I felt safe with both of our drivers. This made it much easier than trying to find a cab or Uber as well. It didn't cost that much more than a taxi would of based on my research.Before we arrived I contacted the hotel with some requests and Yadira was the primary contact and she was EXCELLENT! She went out of her way to make sure we were taken care of during our stay. We ate in the hotel restaurant for breakfast one morning and it was very good. The small coffee shop was OK, nothing special, but convenient. All of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful during our stay.

We opted for the Queen Suite with view having been to NYC before and knowing that rooms tend to be on the small size. We weren't expecting it to be a 'Vegas Sized' suite but it was big enough for our needs and the separate seating area allowed us to store away our suitcases easily. We were on the 19th floor facing the opposite side to the Empire State Building, so we could see out towards the Met Life building and various other skyscrapers.The bed was comfy enough and we had 2 TV's although we did only use the separate seating area for luggage storage so never used the 2nd TV.There is very little draw and hanging space so we had to be creative in where we placed our clothing and I was disappointed that the shower was over the bath as oppose to being a separate shower.When we arrived it was raining heavily so were thankful for the umbrella that was hanging in the room. It wasn't until we came back in the evening that we noticed the umbrella was on the mini bar menu for $15!! We placed it back and was not charged upon check out. The only other gripe I have is the complete lack of shower gel in the room. I did ask at reception for some to be brought up but it never materialised so I went out and bought my own.We never ate at the hotel so can't comment on the food but all the staff we encountered were helpful and courteous. The bar downstairs was good for drinks and the hotel has many close bars and restaurants, although all of Manhattan is easily accessible by cab or subway (or good old fashioned walking), due to the hotels central location.The hotel offer an airport shuttle through a 3rd party which we took back to JFK and it was on time and very reasonably priced @ $25 each.I'd stop there again if booking a Midtown hotel","Knowle, United Kingdom","Hoppy75</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Knowle, United Kingdom</strong>",22,4.0

The bed was very comfortable and the floor to ceiling windows are nice -- the view of the skyline is great.The staff was great including the front desk. Eddie at the front door is incredibly helpful and nice - truly cares about the guests and goes out of his way to assist. While I was waiting for a ride, I saw him help a man find his phone and welcome quite a few guests and their luggage to the hotel - without skipping a beat. He's a gem!  Like other reviewers, I note that the modular furniture does not allow for much hanging and storage space - especially in the standard queen size room. If you are at the hotel for more than a few days, it probably will not be sufficient space, especially for more than one person.As a woman who travels on business frequently, I appreciate a secure and well run hotel. That's why I've stayed here several times since it opened. I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant with a guest and enjoyed it -- not inexpensive (as is true of most hotels) but very nice. With my room, I received a certificate good for a coffee and muffin in the take out area - also very nice.

The standard queen room was tiny but modern, new, clean and comfortable. The room had big windows, lots of natural light and a lovely view of the city. Space is tight but used efficiently. There is barely any space on the floor for your suitcase (though there is a suitcase rack) and very little closet space but the room is well equipped with coffee maker, iron and ironing board, plus an umbrella (a nice touch). The Queen bed is very comfortable. The electric outlets are few and not well placed but adequate. The bathroom is spacious but could use more counter space for toiletries. Free wifi is fast enough. Staff is very friendly and helpful. There are also two computers plus a printer in the basement for guest use. Overall it's a very comfortable and convenient hotel to stay.

We ended up paying $2990 including all taxes for a ""Queen Suite with a View"". That meant the room would have an extra sitting area separate from the bedroom and be on a floor 13 or above with a view. The room had all of that. I had made a call prior to the stay and based on a previous review asked for Yadira in order to get a room with a view of the Empire State building. We did get that but other than that you can't see much other than rooftops from where we were. No big deal, although they may have better views facing Broadway, not sure. At any rate here is what I thought.The Good: The staff was friendly. Upon going into the room I immediately called housekeeping to request two extra pillows and extra hangers and they were brought up right away. The room was clean (see the bad for details), The bed was comfy, The windows opened for fresh air, the street noise was not an issue. The bathroom was large and the shower was really good (other than the fact it was a tub shower, which I never understand, who takes a bath in a hotel anyway unless its a Jacuzzi tub) Free WIFI which was excellent. There is a small fridge, sink and Keurig in the room. There are plenty of places to grab a snack things to bring back to the room on the same block as the hotel. We didn't try the Restaurant on the first floor during our stay.The Strange: So the ""sitting room"" that made this into ""a suite"" was an alcove across from the bathroom with one single chair and a table. There was also a 2nd TV across from the chair next to the bathroom door. When I first saw this, It thought it was hysterical that they called this a ""suite"". Although I still think it is a poor excuse for a ""suite"" it actually came in handy at night when my wife was ready to go to sleep and I could sit in this alcove and watch TV or read my tablet without disturbing her. (low volume or closed captions on the TV.) The door to the closet was so close to the bed that I always had to wait for my wife to get away from sitting on the bed in order to get into the closet.The Bad, but not terrible: The only Ice machine is on the 2nd floor. With only 2 elevators and no service elevator for the maids, going down 16 floors to get Ice was only worth the trip once. I didn't find out until the last day they would have brought Ice up to the room if you called to ask.It didn't matter if we left the room at 8am or 11am, if we came back around 3pm to rest up before going out to dinner and a play or such, the room was never made up yet. We would have to tell the desk on our way out for dinner and it would be made up by the time we got back after our evening outing. Most evenings they did do a good job of cleaning the room, but one night, (funny enough a night I complained about the issue of never having the room clean when we return at 3 or so) they left chocolates as a ""sorry"" gesture but forgot to clean the dishes or replenish the coffee. The location is not really a ""bad"" but I thought I would note that even though it is in walking distance from all the shows and Penn Station, the nearest Subway is 2 blocks and Broadway and most Shows are about 1/2 mile to 1 mile. Overall, we were pleased with the Hotel. If there is another trip, I would consider it or something slightly better location wise.","Eagle River, Alaska","ERakguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eagle River, Alaska</strong>",25,4.0

I think that it's odd that housekeeping needs to get into my room an hour after I just checked in. I assume it's a mistake, and throw the notice away. I go out to meet colleagues at another hotel (where they are staying). We have such a productive meeting, I don't return to my room until after breakfast the next day. So I go to my room to make sure I have all my stuff, and a house-keeper jumps at me, What are you doin? she asks aggressively. I explain to her that this is my room, I haven't checked out yet and I just want to check my room to make sure I didn't leave anything. She gets very aggressive and doesn't want to let me in. I show her my key card, which still works and everything. I have to practically push past her to check out my room. It was an awful experience. I travel a lot in my work, and I have never encountered such rude housekeeping staff ever before. Furthermore, the housekeeper called down to the front desk to report that a guest had abruptly barged into her own room. When, I checked out, the receptionist was not cordial and didn't ask me how my stay was. Listen, people, I may not wear a suit, but I am still an executive.

It isn't easy to afford an ideal hotel in this city -- meaning location and price. But we had a better view than if we had stayed at the Plaza -- we overlooked the Empire State Building (at about a block away, it's actually so close it feels as though you could reach out and touch it), and downtown including the World Trade Center, standing at the distant center of our view. Bryant Park and the New York Public Library are a five minute walk, a 20 minute walk to Central Park. Times Square, Radio City, Broadway, Rockefeller Plaza, St. Patrick's Cathedral and Fifth Avenue shopping are all centrally located to this hotel, all within a 5-20 minute walking distance. Stroll through Central Park on your way to the museums. It was perfect for the fall weather -- just bring a comfortable pair of shoes. The hotel and our room was impeccably clean, the staff was delightful, warm and welcoming -- and helpful when we needed a wine bottle opener -- from the moment they opened their doors to us. From the front desk to the doorman, to the hotel managerial staff -- they were all professional and personable. The rooms feel like more of a cozy, modern apartment rather than hotel -- which is what I love about boutique hotels. And that view. We felt like pampered Manhattan millionaires for a couple of days. I can't wait to come back to Le Soleil, and I am so glad to have stumbled upon it. But as the hotel is relatively new, I just hope they never sacrifice quality -- such is often the unfortunate price.Okay. My one gripe -- hotel coffee is always horrendous. And I'm a basic coffee girl, I don't need fancy coffee. But I wish hotels would cut it out with the gas-station grade coffee for these ridiculous capsule coffee makers. And also, I need more than one packet of coffee mate. Spend a little money on good coffee for your guests, I'm begging you. Did I mention, I love coffee? But lucky for you, there's either a Starbucks, deli or cafe every few feet in the city. But still, give us some good coffee to wake up to!

The hotel is in a great location easy to walk to Central Park, highline, very close to Times Square, and there is a subway right around the corner. I didn't think much to be so close to Heralds Square but it was actually quite nice we often bought breakfast and ate it there in the small park. The room was both quiet and clean and seemed like our own little wing. The gym was nice as well and had all the amenities. Lots of people have commented on the size, we had a queen suite and with everything I have heard I found the size absolutely fine for New York. The maid service each day was wondeful. There were two drawbacks: the first night, the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night, waking our family, we were then told to please stand by, so obviously technical, though I was worried at the time. There were three more alarms, four more loudspeaker announcements and an announcement to 'go back to what you were doing' it was 230am naturally this was sleeping for most guests including our infant who was awoken multiple times. That kind of stuff just happens and I realize if it's a technical issue the hotel is not expected to offer discounts on the room and such. But I was confused that nothing as said at all, I was expecting perhaps a short apology note, a small coupon for coffee, or at least for the staff to acknowledge what happened. That kind of thing really throws off anyone hoping for a great nights rest. Second the whole staff is fantastic the bellman, the maids, but the front desk staff is a little below their standards in comparison, twice we asked for a restaurant recommendation and were told to 'walk around' I found this impersonal for such a nice establishment maybe as they establish themselves they will form preferred relationships with great restaurants in the area.

Nothing requested was too hard or impossible and many evenings we would get back to the hotel very late and then spend the next hour or so getting to know these wonderful , hospitable people whose sole focus is to ensure their guests have a wonderful stay in their lovely hotel.Dre and his crew of Lily, Mo and Tysheba,amongst others, were always familiar faces we looked forward to coming home to after day after day exploring everything NEW York has to offer.The hotel is a wonderful boutique hotel with ample room inside the suites and definitely not the small little rooms one comes to expect from most hotels in and around Le Soleils location....the restaurant serves wonderful food and we were also very lucky that the cafe had just opened where we delighted in coffee each and every morning....our friends who stayed at different hotels became advocates of the coffee shop also.We have definitely made friends for life with the staff at the hotel and hope to someday return the compliment should they ever wish to explore our beautiful country Australia.Dr Dre and the gang, you guys are legends and we appreciate you making our stay in your beautiful city a magical one....keep in touch and keep doing what you guys keep doing.....and hey Mo dont you lose that music in your soul...sing loud and proud baby girl.See you all again soon.Danny and Carol Daher from Down Under!!!!!","Sydney, Australia","_danieldaher1971</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",4,5.0

I asked for the front desk to help me get a taxi while I freshened up in their lobby bathroom. They did not find me a ride (and we are in the biggest city in the world - there are taxis everywhere) which made me late to my event. The hotel staff asked me to leave my luggage against a wall until my room was ready and that they would take it up to my room for me. When I arrived 4 hours later, the luggage was still sitting where I left it in the lobby (luckily untouched). I expect MUCH more from an ""executive hotel."" Second, my room was clean and spacious, however, housekeeping knocked on my door one night at 11pm with no explanation as to why they were knocking (very shady.. Much too late to be knocking on the door) and to top it off, there was a pipe issue which resulted in a repetitive wobbling sound every single minute. I did not sleep and it was very annoying.

The AC doesn't make a sound (we were there when it was about 30°C so much needed), and we didn't hear a lot of street noise for NY (NY is a noisy city, so we could hear some but I'd say they were pretty well blocked). - we went to the restaurant (Trademark) and the food was great (albeit a bit salty for us, but this seems to be quite common in NY). The restaurant is a bit noisy (again, seems to be quite common in NY!), but try to get a booth and it helps. However, as mentioned above, we had a very deceiving experience with the concierge who arranged our shuttle back to the airport. Not only did we find him quite rude but the shuttle never came! We booked the 1:30pm shuttle and he told us to be there at 1:20pm. By 1:45pm the shuttle was still not there and everytime we asked him where the shuttle was the guy kept saying ""it's here, in a few minutes"" and he was on his phone all the time so we could never really speak to him (it sometimes seemed like he was avoiding us). By 2pm (we had been waiting for 40min and the shuttle was 30min late) we got a little impatient and told him we had had enough waiting and we needed to know where the shuttle was, and he told us it would be there in 20 minutes!! Needless to say we were not happy at all, we told him to cancel the shuttle and pay us back (luckily we had paid in cash) and that we would find another way to get to the airport. We asked Eddie (the doorman) if we could help us find a cab to get to the airport and he did just that: 10 minutes later a big car (big enough for the four of us and our bags) pulled up and we were on our way to the airport (and made it on time!). We were quite surprised that a hotel with such great service would have such a bad shuttle service and it stained our impression of our stay to have a stressful experience like that to finish off at LeSoleil.

My executive queen room was small (not unusual in New York) but very clean. There's no closet, but the glass shelving unit includes an open rod about a foot long for hanging clothes, sufficient for one person on a business trip. The shelving unit also contained an iron and ironing board plus a nice big umbrella for the predicted rain. There are three drawers and a good-sized desk area, with a desk lamp that has extra electrical outlets around its base. Beneath the desk was a folding luggage rack. The alarm clock (set about an hour ahead of actual time and which I could never figure out how to re-set) contains one USB port. There's no printed hotel information booklet, but you can find out where the ice machine is located (2nd floor) and that the restaurant next door is closed on Sundays, etc. on the TV's main information menu. A liter of bottled water was provided on the first day, presumably for the Keurig beverage maker. My room was on the 17th floor and the street noise was audible but relatively low for New York, not an impediment to sleep. I was able to set a comfortable temperature in the room and the shower was good--my only suggestion is to put in a grab bar or two for clientele who might need some extra stability in the shower, as the entrance is about four (slippery) feet away from the controls. I appreciated the extra make-up mirror in the bathroom. There is no room service, but there are several places to eat or buy a sandwich within a few meters of the hotel.","Centreville, Virginia","Denise M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Centreville, Virginia</strong>",13,4.0

Let me start with the positives.Hotel is well situated near Penn Station and convenient subway to both up and downtown. The neighborhood is nothing special (lots of hotels) but convenient nonetheless. The hotel is new and has thick sound proof windows that open. Bedding was comfortable and the bathroom was very large and modern. Good lighting. Check in was quick and only 8 rooms per floor. Now the downers. The std queen room is incredibly small. There were a number of design flaws. The desk chair is huge considering the size of the room and bulky to move above. The coffee maker occupied 25% of the desks space, yet they give you only 2 coffee pods for the day. The bathroom was spacious and shower was great. But there is no place to put anything, we left toiletries on the floor. This would be a hard hotel for 2 people for more than a few days (climbing over your luggage gets old). I didn't see the larger room, but would opt for that. Wifi was free and worked well.Guest services cost the hotel their *. The housekeeping provides only a single bar of soap, which usually meant climbing thru the wet shower stall to grab the single soap bar. Easy enough - we went to front desk and asked for more soap and coffee pods (ironic they provide 1 caf and 1 decaf pod, doesn't make sense). However, they never got delivered (we had to go back down to the front desk to ask a 2nd time).On our last morning, we realized that housekeeping had not provided fresh bath towels or shampoo and called the front desk again. 40 minutes later the bellman turns up with a single towel. By this point, we'd improvised using hand towels and not in a good mood about it. Ironically, the bellman wouldn't leave the fresh towels and disappeared.Staff training is problematic and for a hotel running $300 a night, my expectations were somewhat higher.","Hong Kong, China","roadwarrior30</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",353,3.0

The Empire State Building is just across the street and some rooms – like ours – have a wonderful view of it.The room was cozy and nicely decorated with huge windows and very comfortable bed.

The washroom was up to date and reminded me of those in condominiums, I felt like a Queen. The room had snacks for sale and a bar fridge loaded with a few drinks. I would have liked something that would have allowed me to keep a slice of pizza in it though. There was no safe in the room, though it was advertised, oh well!! My room had a big, beautiful window and lots of light. It was hot that weekend so the air conditioner was just right and easy to maneuver. Not much closet space though. The space provided was just enough to hang 1 pair of pants and maybe a shirt. The pillows were very uncomfortable. They remind me of the standard overly soft pillows which disturb your sleep. Please change this, it really makes a difference. My last point revolves around check out process. I had discussed the checkout with an employee extensively the night before. When I went to check out, there was no bellperson. After the check out person called two cab companies, I was told that I could hail a cab at either the street behind the hotel or at the intersection close to the hotel. I was not impressed as it was 4am and I was alone. Luckily, I caught a yellow cab just as I excited. I really want come back to this hotel, but this incident is making me think twice.

Our queen suite was on the 13th floor and was very quiet. Though just above a road, we heard very little street noise even with the windows open. Any noise noted came from the hallway, which rarely occurred. The room is small compared to most standards, but was large compared to NYC standards. When the door opened, one was standing in the sleeping area. The bathroom had a sliding door and a huge shower that could easily accommodate two people. There was a small ""living"" area with two comfortable IKEA style chairs and small table with a lamp. A television was in both the living and sleeping areas. The bed was soft and comfortable, and four sleeping pillows were provided. Climate could be controlled fairly well. There was ample counter space in the bathing area. Everything was quite clean. The hotel provided robes for each of us along with slippers. Also shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, etc. There is a mini fridge that is stocked with drinks and snacks, but we opted to use it for our own items. A desk suitable for a computer and a few other things along with an arm-less, multi-purpose chair was in the room. Heavy wooden hangers were also provided. The hotel also has wi-fi and HBO but no other premium channels.There is little to no space for personal items. We like to unpack when on vacation. We each kept our items in our suitcases as there was only a tiny bit of drawer space, and enough space to hang a couple of suits. Ethan found himself needing to barter for counter space as Sally took up most of the counter space in the bathroom. (Girls need our stuff!!!) Also, while not a huge deal, the toilet handle would frequently stick. (We are certain that the staff would have immediately addressed this had we reported it.)This brings us to the wonderful staff. When we decided to laze about in the room for most of the day, we left a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door and it was totally respected. A letter was left for us outside of our door stating that they would happily address our room or needs after hours with a phone call to the desk. We asked the concierge for a recommendation of a good place to get a bagel. A few minutes later, there was a knock at our door. He gave us the name of a place along with a printed copy of directions. We requested a late check-out and was accommodated easily. We were generally greeted coming and going. Last but not least of all, Ethan forgot his credit card at the front desk and they gave it to Sally at his recommendation when she came in without a single worry of a wild shopping spree. There was space to visit in the main lobby and also a coffee shop/restaurant, but we did not make use of it.

The last time I was here I even booked 4 other rooms for my friends and family and convinced them to stay here.This time in NYC I decided to try something different and stayed at another property around the corner but was not impressed and soon moved back to the Executive for my final nights stay in NYC. Now Eddie at the door is a charm and recognised me straight away and took me to the front desk and let them know I was a very regular customer. I was only in town for 1 night and had booked a standard room as the price difference to the suite was ridiculous for 1 night. Just to add I usually stay in the queen suit as they are very spacious and perfect for a longer stay. Anyway at reception I asked Eddie to see if he could possibly get us an upgrade as a favour and Im sure he asked but unfortunately the management does not see fit in rewarding loyalty. I understand if the hotel was at capacity but from looking online they had numerous queen suites available and although Im not expecting something for nothing and was more than happy to be in my room I had booked and paid for I just feel it would have been a nice touch to upgrade us.The hotel itself and location is awesome but certain staff and management could do with a lesson in customer service. On one of my trips in Jan I was caught up in the snow storm and checked the price of extending my stay on booking.com and then checked at reception which was much higher. When I informed the member of staff I was advised to book it on booking.com. this along with telling me to go to my room for a cup of tea when there was a machine in reception was not very welcoming.In regards to extending my stay and telling me to book online, I was not impressed as I had extended my stay on a previous trip and the member of staff at the time matched booking.com.Do I like this hotel and will I stay again? Yes probably, although I did initially change over to a different hotel for the first few nights which shows my loyalty to executive le soleil isn't what it has been and this is all down to the service of staff.",,DiveshP,18,3.0

Overall, it was a fine stay, but nothing special. There were a few key things that made the stay less then great and would cause me not to return.First, the good. The staff were very friendly when I arrived late with a reservation that had just been booked. The got me checked in quickly, and sent me off to my room. The room on first glance was nice, small, even by New York standards, with a larger bathroom, mini-bar, robe, and good size TV. Also, as a big plus, I had a non-view room (actually my preference) which was very quiet and had no street noise.Now for the not-so-good. My number one complaint is the bedding, which is listed as “sumptuous beds with luxurious bedding.” I will tell you right now that it is are anything but that. The beds are old, and hard as a rock, and the sheets are so scratchy that I was looking for anything to wrap myself in so I didn’t have to touch them. Even just sitting on the bed wasn’t comfortable. If you like hard beds with scratchy sheets, you’ll be good, otherwise look elsewhere. Also, as a note, I know people are going to say bedding may be preferential, but I have literally never had this problem at any hotel I’ve ever stayed before Le Soleil. Probably the worst night of sleep I have ever had in a hotel.My other complaint is about room cleanliness. While the room was overall, fairly clean, the walls had dirt scuffs on them, there was dust everywhere, especially on top of pictures, baseboards, etc., and the bathroom shower could have been cleaner.Overall, it was an okay stay, but I don’t think that I would go running back to this “luxury” boutique hotel, especially in NYC where there are so many other options.",United States,"TravelingFoodie719</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United States</strong>",14,3.0

We stayed in a very generous sized room, with a queen bedroom on one side and the sleeper sofa in the main area of the suite, with the luxurious bathroom in-between.The hotel earned its 4 stars in the usual ways (gracious lobby, attention to detail, furnishings) - however it really set itself apart by their treatment of their guests. I mentioned that it was my sister's birthday during our stay, so they noted this on the reservation. I was overjoyed when the crew at reception broke into a chorus of ""Happy Birthday"" on our second night there. Upon getting home, I realized that I might have left behind some clothing at the hotel.

The room is just laid out well. There’s a sitting room when you enter with TV, then the bath in the middle which kind of separated or made a separate bedroom. The bed was very comfortable and I was able to sleep with the window open or partially open. There was a coffee maker in the room and the housekeeper generously gave me extra coffee. The designer utilized glass armoire’s for closets which further separated the sleeping area from any noise in the hall or from the elevator.This hotel is a rare find for NYC with a great location just off 5th avenue and short walk from Penn Station.

We found a great deal on booking.com and paid around $160 a night. We got a room on the 19th floor. The room was standard NYC size but the bathroom was quite big. We had a small closet (almost walk-in) which I understand not all rooms have. That made a huge difference, otherwise we wouldn't have had enough room for the clothes we brought for our one week stay. (Suitcases were kept closed standing, not enough space to have them laying down, hence one doesn't want to keep the clothes in them.) The bed and pillows were so comfortable! The duvet could have been thicker, first night was a bit too cold for me. Room was clean and nicely decorated. Since the hotel is quite new everything in the room was really nice, not worn at all. The view was great, big window facing the Empire State Building and far away One World Trade Center. The room was quiet from outside noise but the air conditioning made some noise. We had to turn it off each night to not get disturbed by it. Bathroom had a nice design, also very clean. Downside was the low water pressure in the shower (which others also have noticed).Location is perfect for a tourist, close to subway at 34th street and in the middle of Manhattan making it easy to get around all of Manhattan (and to other boroughs) by subway or even by walking. The staff was really polite and helpful!Despite the minor downsides explained above I give the hotel 5 out of 5, as you can see, because of the low rate we paid. You probably won't find another hotel this good to that low rate in Manhattan. If I had paid their standard rate I would probably have given it 4 out of 5.

It turned out to be an excellent choice! The hotel is relatively new in midtown, with easy access to pretty much every train line, including Penn Station, all within a few blocks. In fact, they were still working on the restaurant, which is expected to be open in March. Although smack dab in the center of midtown, amazingly, it was the quietest stay I ever experienced in NYC. The suite was very new and clean, and quite comfortable. It does, however, seem geared to the short stay business traveler b/c there is NO closet. There was an area to hang clothes that was attached to the desk and book-ended by some shelving and 4 SMALL drawers. The ""closet"" had 5 hangers, and one of those precious hangers was occupied by a hotel robe... say what?!?!?!?! I would have asked for more, but there wouldn't have been room, since the ironing board was hogging up space! I've never learned to pack light, so found it challenging to deal with this shortcoming (exacerbated by a winter coat... now down to 3 empty hangers!!!!), but finally figured a strategy that allowed me to hang my current and next day's clothes on a rotating basis. This was not make or break for me, but worth noting. On the plus side, the bathroom was a decent size, though neither small nor large. Be forewarned that it is accessed with a pocket door directly across from the desk chair, so when you get up from the desk, you have to manhandle the chair (no wheels) back under the desk to get into the bathroom. Staff was really wonderful and helpful, the doormen were rarely there when you needed them... particularly, upon entering the hotel. This was largely due to a portable entrance to keep the cold air from blowing into the hotel, which I expect won't be necessary in more temperate climes.

The rooms are amazing with the glass closets and showers and - if you are fortunate enough to get the Empire State view - it is like nothing I have ever experienced. The staff is always so nice and hospitable and they even remember me now when I enter the hotel or my company makes the reservation. In a busy city like NYC, it is amazing to find a jewel like the LeSoleil that treats you like you are their #1 customer each time you visit. My last experience this past week, I had an amazing room with my own sitting room cut out from the rest of the room. The bathroom was huge and the bed was comfy as always. I felt like a celebrity!

Odd as it may sound for a reputable hotel.On our arrival this had not been prepared and two staff members told me that they had decided on another date and asked when I would want the surprise to be.I find this very odd and not only a turndown but a turnoff.Your front desk person said that if she had failed she was sorry and there wold be plenty of nice memories in NY anyway.This is very disapointing. As is the size of your queen sized bed which is not 60” to 70” unless you are using a smalleer inch than usually is.I do hope you make sure that if a guest orders something on a specific date he will not have to negotiate with your staff for another date more suitable for them. To add to my letter I found it overrated and underserviced. The attitude I got from the front desk when complaining over them ruining a romantic entry was increadable. I would not go there again and not recomend it. Technically everything is there. Except for a polite attitude. I do not like that. I love giving my wife a romantic reception when we are travelling and this hotel is the first one to blunder it.Any positive points? The cleaning staff is nice.We will finish our stay here at a very overpriced hotel but I will not boook here again, nor can I recommend it, There are two hotels next door.

Our hotel location was very convenient and everywhere we wanted to go was within walking distance. The hotel is surrounded by bars, shops/stores, tourist locations, restaurants, etc. We didn't really need the metro passes that we bought. There was construction but it wasn't a bother or anything.Everyone here was amazing. The staff greet you every time they see you. Ed/Eddie was one of the memorable staff members that we talked to. It wasn't just because he worked in the front, he also sang to one of his coworkers. It was the cutest and sweetest thing to see! He was so happy and energetic, which was so contagious. It made us smile. Besides him, the people at the front desk were also very friendly. We were able to talk to them comfortably. Stanley was nice too! Everyone was a total sweetheart. I wasn't able to get everyone's name but I wish I did, so I could include at least one thing about each of them.Although the check out time is at 12 noon, our bus ride back to Boston wasn't until 12:30 midnight.

The first time was on business and I enjoyed my stay so much I booked this place again for a family trip to NYC to see a Broadway show.

The location is great (just a few blocks from Times Square) however it is just far enough away where the street and surrounding areas are not crowded at all so you can walk around without fighting the times square mob scene. I have never stayed in a more quieter hotel room in NYC. Since the building is so new the insulation and windows block out so much of the noise that you usually hear from the street and the adjacent hotel rooms. We reserved an executive room with two queens and the room was quite large by NYC standards. Everything was very clean and brand new.

All of them were just perfect :) 2) Fantastic location ! Can easily access to the main activities by walk or subway or taxi. (i.e. Times Square is really at 10-15 min walk max, Empire State Building at 5 min walk and even the One World Tower is at about 1h by walk by crossing the different areas of NYC that is also just a great time to spend)3) Hotel is in a street (not avenues) so not that much car traffic passing4) Got the king size executive. The bed was very soft but surprisingly extremely comfortable.Negative Points :1) We booked the king size executive room type but our room was on the lower floors (4th) of the building and facing the street. Therefore, no view (except on the street) and it was, at times, a bit noisy during the night and early morning due to the car traffic & garbage/delivery truck & the dancing school (used for some latin dances on Saturday nights etc ...) in front of the hotel. (I am a light sleeper ... so I would recommend to ask for the back-street room if you are light sleepers ...)2) The bell of the elevator can be heard in the rooms (even when the lift is not at your storey, therefore ask for a room far from the lifts because it can be easily annoying during the night and early morning if you are light sleeper) We also could hear people talking when they were walking in the aisles ... (But hopefully no noise at all from the other rooms)3) Got ""special rates"" when booked and therefore was good quality/price compared to the others hotels in NYC but it can be quite expensive if you pay the full price ...Despite these 3 ""negative"" points, I recommend this hotel but with the higher floors rooms and facing on the Empire State Building view","Penglai, China","PonPonJoubJoub</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Penglai, China</strong>",12,4.0

We found this hotel on Jetsetter and the price was terrific so each couple booked an Executive Queen Suite. Check in was quick and we did request that our rooms be located where we had good light and were not next to the elevators. We were on the 6th floor, so no views of ESB and one of our rooms faced the back of buildings on the other street-which was not pretty at all , but did add to the quiet . The hotel feels very 'Kimpton'. Modern, clean and warm. The lobby is small , but there is a drawing type room at rear with a gas fireplace and many areas suitable for conversation or relaxing. They should have their restaurant open in a month or so- which will add the necessary component needed to encourage guests to linger - so hope to check that out on a future trip. Room and AmenityThe rooms are very modern and appeal to my type of accommodation. Surfaces are clean and open and the lighting is pleasant with table lamps and mood lighting , so add a feel of relaxation and calm. Please note- if you are a typical traveler who takes tons of luggage on short trips- this hotel is not going to be ideal for you.Hanging space is quite limited, but there are drawers and a desk - which we annexed to hold our items while there. We had a queen suite which was divided into two areas- space wise by the bath. The sitting area had two chairs from IKEA ... And next to it on the side table - a note stating that their ' real' furniture was on order, but had not yet arrived. The chairs worked ok, but we're not the type of chair you'd see in a hotel of this quality and by no means encouraged us to ' sit' in the sitting area for long. I really do hope their order comes in soon.!Rooms are pretty darn quiet by NYC standards. I did find it odd that housekeeping ' upped' the room thermostat every time they cleaned. Both couples found the rooms plenty warm enough , and had to open a window for 10 minutes to ' balance' the heat upon our return. The room was very clean, and the bath was well appointed. Suggestions: Move the TP holder to under the wood vanity edge as more than once I either scraped my leg or knocked the TP to the floor. Also, please provide at least two bars of soap please ( one for shower, one for sink) and how about a shower cap or other necessary toiletries that we travelers count on ? A second set of glasses for the bath would also be nice . I loved the product choice , but felt that the restocking of towels and such - should have been a bit more generous with 2 in a room. The bed was quite comfortable, with great sheets and nice lighting in the room very good - both for make up and dressing. Thank you for the amazing full length mirror and the In room safe - both really good features. The Keurig coffee maker in our room was not working , so they did replace it- however- like another guest noted - it only came with enough capsules for one person to have coffee. This is something they can improve in the months to come... by offering complementary coffee in the lobby in the morning or by adequate supply in the guest's rooms. These are the details where Kimpton and Portrait hotels shine and truly do bolster guest loyalty. LeSoleil.. Hope you are taking notes?Staff We found the staff to be helpful and engaging. Eddie was wonderful and the housekeeping team did honor the notes I left requesting extra towels etc. Stanley also worked his magic at flagging down taxis in the pouring rain and the desk personal seemed amiable and friendly. Location:Location is good ,especially if you are up there seeing shows .It's an easy walk to the Empire State Building , a nice walk to Flat Iron district or Bryant Park - and we even walked to MOMA despite the frigid temps this past week. Neighborhood Food and feel: Food is not as ' local' as some other neighborhoods , but you can easily solve that by dining outside of the immediate area- as this part of town is more geared to tourists than city dwellers. This is main stream shopping with no real speciality stores nearby. You will find all the chains.. Macy's , H&M, etc. I never did find a grocery store, which is the real sign that there is a neighborhood associated with this part of town. Your choices for that type of stuff will be limited. To summarize, a lovely and polished hotel , with a modern elegant feel that is proximate to many of the destinations travelers to NYC may want. I like where they are heading and expect that they continue to work to entice return guests by making it even more comfortable down the road. I hope that EHL will improve on the details that seem ever so close to their reach- as I would likely stay there again.

As others have said, the lobby was quite large, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and incredibly professional. The inside has a great look, very upscale appearance, even in the rooms. The check-in process was simple and quick, although I found the policy of requesting a late check-out to be strange. I requested a late check out promptly during check in, but was told that late check-out requests had to be made the morning of check-out, which can defeat the purpose entirely. The rooms were quite small, even for New York standards, but the bathroom was massive, and the view was great. I was more than a little upset at the lack of a closet in my room in which to hang my suits, the only option being to move the bathrobe and umbrella to take advantage of the limited space in which to hang anything. Additionally, I found the condoms and lubricant available on the desktop in my room to be more than a little tacky, and made me question whether or not I should be paying for the room by the hour. Finally, upon getting ready to leave this morning, I found at the foot of my bed, on the sheets that had been previously covered by the comforter the evening before, an unsettling brown stain (picture enclosed) that made me severely doubt how well the linens had been cleaned. Despite the professional staff, the wonderful interior decorating, and the great location of this hotel, this incident with the sheets has entirely put me off returning to this hotel on future business trips.",,Adam G,4,3.0

We were upgraded to a nicer room when the staff learnt it was our anniversary and the room was not as small as we thought New York rooms will be. It was a good size, very modern and very neat. The staff were just simply amazing, from the doorman to the staff at the reception, to the Managers. Everyone seemed so polite, so welcoming, so warm and so professional and so willing to help. We enjoyed the service so much that we paid to stay an extra night instead of spending it at a family friends'.At night, it was very peaceful considering we were in the center of a city that truly never sleeps. We have decided that as long as they continue to have a receptive and respectful culture, we would not try anywhere else as we really enjoyed our stay here.If you are looking for a hotel with OK sized rooms, impeccable service and strategically located, then look no further than the Executive Hotel LeSoleil.

The reception staff were polite but the first thing we were asked when we arrived was did we want to upgrade to a suite and we weren't actually given any details of the hotels facilities and then they weren't helpful once we turned down the upgrade. Luckily we had asked to see the upgrade offer and the room we were booked in to to compare. The upgrade was not worth $175 more which was what they were asking for. Also the website for this hotel it states dressing gown and slippers provided, which is a bonus and saves packing your own but when we arrived there was only one dressing gown and no slippers. We rang down to ask about the dressing gown and got the response that guests usually bring their own!! Not when you advertise supplying them they don't! Anyway the did provide another dressing but we didn't dare ask for slippers as well. Another thing that is advertised is coffee machine and again this is strange as the provide 1 pod decaf coffee and 1pod normal coffee and some days 1 pod green tea now as their were two of us you would think they would supply 2 pods of each so you could both have the same if you wanted. The guys on the door were very friendly and helped direct you and provide suggestion for where to eat, perhaps they should teach the receptionists how hospitality works.

I got a spacious room, huge TVs, and lovely crisp linen of peculiar sizes (maybe it's an American thing!). And the service from Luis at Reception and the other staff was exemplary. The location can't be beaten for exploring central New York - between 5th and 6th Avenues, and next door to Broadway and access to the subway, a little way along from Times Square. Couple of downsides - the shower pressure was terrible (I was on the 8th floor). It would almost make me not book here again as after a long flight or a day walking the city I was desperate to have a strong, hot shower, and with such a weak flow I was shivering. (And you'll have a terrible time if you have long hair to rinse!) Also shampoo, conditioner, moisturiser and a soap are provided, so bring your own shower gel if you prefer this to a bar of soap. The towels are tiny, no bath sheets or hair towels here sadly. The extensive extras available in the room were very expensive (altho the coffee machine was free and great!), so I recommend a deli a few doors down the street for essentials such as bottled water and midnight feast supplies. And as other people have stated, you have to be patient with the lifts, so best not to be in a hurry to get somewhere!One final thing to watch out for - when you check in, even if you've already paid for your stay, you will be expected to hand over a card to be debited immediately by $50 for each night of your stay to cover incidentals, unlike the UK where you simply provide card details and no payment is taken until you check out. The dollars will eventually be refunded into your bank account. I was told this is an American hotel thing, but it caught me by surprise and didn't appear on any of my booking documents (it does appear on the hotel's own website apparently). I was very kindly shown some flexibility on this as I made a big fuss, so pre-warned is pre-armed!All in all, a lovely stay in a great location. The hotel will arrange transfers which is super-helpful, and having done a shared shuttle, next time I would definitely spend more to have my own cab.

Also, the shower in my room had a unique design which was cool -- except it didn't drain very well (I think this was because of the design, it drained into a slit in the middle but didn't drain fast enough to enjoy your shower without overflowing the shower area). And the toilet (also a design flaw) the handle fell off at one point, I thought a screw was missing, but it was just the way the lever was designed- it didn't screw on but fit just by flattened piece to piece.","Honolulu, Hawaii","steggasaurus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",27,4.0

We had been looking online for the best deal (low enough price, good service, ""cute"" hotel) - and I guess you could say we got almost all of that.We got there after a delayed flight and a very stormy ride (to no fault of the hotel), and right at check in time. Unlike other guests, we had no wait to check in, which was a plus.However, I feel as if the front desk employees could have been considerably more welcoming. On our room reservation (Executive Queen Suite), I made note that we wanted as high of a floor as possible as it was for a special occasion. I called the day before we left for NYC to see if there was an upgrade option to get an ESB view, and they said they would try. Needless to say, we were a little surprised when we got to the front desk and told it was not possible to get a better room in the package we bought, and were stuck on the fifth floor, facing regular NYC buildings.The room itself was not bad. We have been spoiled on previous trips in terms of room size, but I find this room a pretty decent size for New York. Modern furnishings. Clean, simple, and compact. Free wifi, which the kids loved. In all honesty, the view was not terrible, but again - not what we asked for on multiple occasions. The bathroom was spacious. Ask for lots of soap and towels if you have multiple people staying in a room. Should also note that there are only 2 elevators in the hotel -- never had a problem with them though.As others, we really loved the doormen. Front desk employees were always just ""eh."" Overall, just a few changes could make the rating ""Very Good,"" only personal experiences prevented it. Hotel Le Soleil acted as a hotel should while in NYC - a place to rest.

The hotel is clean, modern, and comfortable. Since we arrived about 11:00 on Sunday morning and check in is in the afternoon, they confirmed our reservation and room type and stored our bags for us. We headed out to Times Square, another 10 minute walk, to lunch and a Broadway show. When we returned at about 5 p.m. there was no problem retrieving our luggage and getting our keys. The room was a Queen Suite with a view. It was on the 19th (top) floor. It was a beautiful room, but keep in mind that, in NYC a 19th floor view is one for which you have to look up. It was beautiful nonetheless. There is a place to hang clothes, but no closet -- it worked for us .There was a beautiful robe and an umbrella to borrow, a coffee maker, iron and ironing board, safe, I-phone dock, and hairdryer. The suite had two TVs. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable. The room was quiet. We never heard another person on the floor. The curtains kept it nice and dark in the morning. We were on the run so much our first day that we never noticed the inviting, cozy lobby beyond the registration desk, complete with a fireplace, so we never did get to enjoy that, but will definitely do so on our next stay. There is no restaurant, but they serve pastries with coffee in the morning for $5, and there are two places on the same block that serve breakfast and lunch, and two others that serve dinner as well. With all of the things that we loved about this hotel, what we appreciated the most was the staff. There was not one person who was not friendly, efficient and helpful. Shout out to Eddie, the doorman who first welcomed us to the hotel, and took our luggage from us, and then wished us a safe journey home on our way out.

Nice “wooden like” look and big fancy windows making it look like you was in a “Hollywood movie”. Entering the lobby was always a pleasure since there always was some staff welcoming you into the building. You really felt like home just after one day! The atmosphere in the lobby and the common space (with fireplace) looked very nice. We really never had time to spend there but it sure looked very nice and comfortable. There was no breakfast included but they had a small breakfast to offer. We never used it but trust me, there are plenty of choices just within 3 minutes walking distance from the hotel. So don’t deselect this hotel from you possibility list just because of the breakfast!Regarding the rooms we only have experience for the executive queen suites but WOW what a wonderful experience! We actually booked an Executive Queen Room with view but hade a chance to upgrade during check-in to a suit. Since I read some reviews here on Trip advisor regarding that the rooms was small and that the girl helping us with check-in commented that we should stay for a significant time so a bigger room would be nice we took the chance and upgraded the room. And she also told us that we surely would be happy with the new room and trust me that we where very positive surprised! Of course we missed the view but still we could see almost half of the Empire State Building from the room (stayed at 11th floor) and that was more than enough for us! The room included a bedroom with a nice TV and the bathroom was big and very nice. I liked the shower that was very spacious, not so very common according to my experience. The living room was really a standard increaser! The living room was a Perfect place for relaxing after a day out in New York streets. It had a separate TV (second TV in the suite) and two nice armchairs that really made the evening perfect for planning the next day. There was a note that the standard armchairs were late and still not delivered but the substitution chairs from IKEA made us (from Sweden) feel even more “home” in the room. There was also a minibar and a safe making the room perfect equipped. To be honest I think this is the first hotel room I stayed in that had a perfectly working air condition. After returning from a tough day on the New York Street it only took about 5 minutes to make the room very comfortable. The hairdryer worked very well!The location of the hotel was according to us also perfect. We used 4 days around the hotel without using metro/taxi or bus and still we could visit a lot of stores and tourist places. The other days we used metro to get further away on Manhattan. There was a metro station (34th street station and Penn station) more or less just around the corner. You reached the 34th street Herald square station in just 2 minutes. We went to a New York Rangers game at Madison square garden one night (located just above Penn station) and we reached it by foot in more or less 8 minutes. So for the first stay in New York the location of the hotel is more than perfect! Macys is also just around the corner.I must mention the Concierge service. We really didn’t use it for booking something but we used it to help us with some booking we made our self from home before the visit. They were very helpful and they the help us two times when we were pretty nervous that our own booking was wrong. Once for our tickets to New York Rangers and the other time when our shuttle to the airport going home didn’t arrive as schedule (we didn’t book the shuttle at the hotel, we booked super shuttle by our self). They called the shuttle and when they didn’t arrive still one hour late the man at the concierge desk help us with a private taxi to the airport instead (please send our special thanks to him). We never noticed his name but I guess he has a background from Eastern Europe (like Russia).So now if you read all of my review I am pretty sure that you understand that we were VERY satisfied and we would more than likely recommend this hotel to ALL of you! If we will have the opportunity the revisit New York we would probably not even look at other hotels, Executive Le Soleil is the place to stay at!","Helsingborg, Sweden","FredrikPP</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsingborg, Sweden</strong>",19,5.0

The staff was great, especially the doorman, Eddie who was very helpful. The lobby is decorated for Christmas and is just beautiful. No room service or restaurant but coffee is available at a little cafe in the lobby - very nice. I asked for a room with a view but was told rooms with 2 queen beds were on lower levels - so we had a street view. Not bad but a nice view would have been nice. Room was large enough, but we were given a room with a handicapped accessible bathroom which we did not request and the entire floor sloped into one corner for the shower - are all rooms this way? Not sure. They definitely need a soap dish in the shower area and a bar of soap. Had to use the one tiny soap bar that was furnished for the bathroom sink and there was literally no place to put it while in the shower. (Not sure how someone with a wheelchair would have done in the room itself, which did not seem to be wide enough - but I digress.) Our room was not made up on the second night when we returned from our long day out. I called front desk and they did send up some new towels when I requested them but I was disappointed to have unmade beds etc and they could have comp-ed us something - but they did not. Lots of loud banging - like a jackhammer beginning around 8 am which continued throughout the day. The location is great - just a short walk to Herald Square and the subway and staff was friendly.

The gym is very small and has 2 cardio machines, free weights and one power workout machine. it is also very small, so not comfortable if you're used to a good long workout.I got a queen suite for a reasonable rate of $255, which is actually quite reasonable for NYC, however given the hotel has no facilities, you're basically paying just to sleep. the room has a bedroom, shower and separate living area with a second TV. the queen bed is good just for one person, so while the room itself could fit 2, the bed actually makes it a room for 1. storage for clothes is very limited.I got a room facing the back, so my view was the adjacent building and I could see some of the empire state building. The bed was very comfortable and I actually slept like never before in NYC, as the room was very quiet.Hotel location is ideal on 36th street, close enough to times square but not to close, easy access to subway and penn station, easy access by car to the tunnel to go for for LGA and JFK airports. lots of restaurants and bars and even Kosher places around. Cleaners across the street.staff is polite and professional when you interact with them, but my only interaction was at check in and check out.Room service is a bit inconsistent, coming in inconsistent times, refreshing the shower amenities randomly.

It's in a great location on W38, just a stone's throw from the bustle of Times Square, in fact much nearer than I had realised when booking. On arrival this was a concern, fearing sleepless nights ahead, but the from the 17th floor you could barely hear a thing. Coupled with super thick curtains and a comfy bed sleep was never an issue! Rooms were a reasonable size, very clean and well appointed reflecting that this is still a very new establishment. We had a great view over the city to the WTC and the Empire State Building. Staff were all incredibly polite and helpful, with a big shout out to Kevin, who was working tirelessly but always found time to chat or crack a joke whenever we saw him in the lift. He's a credit to the hotel and always made us smile.The only issue we had (which I think is largely out of the hotel's control) was the shuttle bus that can take you to JFK. We'd planned to get a taxi, but as we were leaving the bus turned up, we had some time so took a punt. But be warned if you experience the same driver we have this is not for the faint heated or anyone unaccustomed to 'robust' language! Now I understand there is a certain style you need to drive in New York and I have respect for anyone crazy enough to do it, but this guy was just a neanderthal. Driving like Otto from the Simpsons at high speed across junctions at the last minute and all whilst shouting out obscenities to someone on a personal phone call. I am by no means a passive driver myself and am rarely offended by bad language, but this guy went way too far, most passengers were shocked. To make matters worse he actually demanded a tip from me as soon as he put my case on the ground (I was about to get out of my pocket anyway!). So my advice pay the extra 20 dollars and get a taxi!

The rooms are small but comfortable. The bathroom is nice sized. The hotel does not yet have its liquor license so there is no on-site bar or alcoholic beverages in the in-room mini bar. The bed was comfortable though only queen sized. We were offered an upgrade to a suite but declined. If you can find a space to stow your bag and are not planning to spend a lot of time in your room it is quite satisfactory. Our room actually had a view. We were on the 12th floor. There was a concierge on duty but I did not use them. It can be a little difficult getting a cab at the hotel door as it is between 5th Ave and Ave of the Americas and is 1-way towards 5th Ave. If the weather is nice and you are not hauling luggage, it is not far to Ave of the Americas where cabs are abundant.

My favorable review is largely based on value and I have the impression that this new hotel may be offering reduced prices to attract customers. For example, the hotel offered an upgrade to a one-bedroom suite for $25.00 a night, which I availed myself of. The suite was spacious. I don't know what a single room is like. It is a very nice hotel: new, clean and spacious. The decor is nice but not exceptional. It's a step up from more expensive chain hotels but not quite in the boutique category. Service was only so-so. The staff are very friendly but the housekeeping service seemed disorganized. They seemed to miss a few things (like no restocking coffee pods) each morning. The free Wi-Fi was outstanding - the best I've ever experienced in New York City.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","pwrstr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",52,5.0

I was upgraded to a higher floor, but you need to ask for it. The advantage is a terrific view of the Empire State Building. The rooms are standard NYC mid-size, but very clean and Quiet with minimalist decor, which makes it seem larger, in my opinion. The bed was ultra comfortable and the TV and bath facilities all worked well. There is a mini-bar with goodies in the room plus a Keurig, but I did not use it. They provide an umbrella, iron, hairdryer and robe for your use, but there is no closet, just a standing shelf unit for handing and folded clothes. One of the cons is no restaurant or bar - just a small counter offering soft drinks, water and pastries, but there are plenty of great options on W36th.

Currently no food & beverage (except for the mini bar) and even the front sidewalk seems incomplete. But it is definitely a working hotel, and a decent one at that. I only wish I could say it was all good, but I did have some difficulties.The first room I was given for my 4-night stay (1707...north-facing, which is to say not much of a view) was tiny. I guess I should say ""normal,"" by NYC standards. And it would have sufficed, I suppose, but for two things: 1) there are no actual closets in the rooms. They have a sort of Ikea-looking piece of furniture that has drawers and a place to hang clothing, but the hanging area is limited and if you have a winter coat or anything wet to hang up, you are out of luck. It's an attractive, minimalist piece of furniture...just not entirely adequate. 2) The shower in room 1707 (and probably some others) is a rainfall shower. But it is not located on the shower ceiling...it is on the wall in front of you. That fact, plus the lack of great water pressure, means you shower under a sort of limp stream of water. The bathroom is beautiful and well appointed, but in my book a hotel room lives or dies by how good the shower is, and this was a fail.Alfredo at the front desk was very nice during my check-in and arranged to have me change rooms after my first night. It took some coordinating to actually do, but he and the rest of the staff were very helpful and for my final 3 nights I was in 1805 – a larger room with a much better view (looking due south past the Empire State Building) and a much better shower. Still with low water pressure, but at least this one was hand-held and thus much more effective.Oh, and still no closet!So, if you can find a nice rate (say, $250 or under) and can somehow get one of the south-facing rooms with a hand-held shower...I'd say go for it. Otherwise, I dunno...just not entirely worth it.

It is very nice and it was worth upgrading to a small suite (which also had a kitchenette). The room was spotless. Upon arrival, there was a little snafu with my reservation - but they reassured me they would handle it (and they did - promptly). The folks at the desk were consistently wonderful, as were the ""doormen"" (they really weren't door men at all -- they were welcoming, helpful hotel ambassadors - just wonderful). I didn't have a lot of requests, but I'm sure if I did, they would have been very helpful. I watched them assist other customers with enthusiasm. There are some minor kinks as this is a new hotel. I understand from the hotel manager that they are going to add a small sofa to the room I was in. I also found the heat/cooling system a little less than optimum -- it was actually warm in nyc this visit and the system seemed to cycle off (motion detector?) while I was sleeping and I would wake up in the middle of the night to a pretty warm room. However, I was on the 19th floor and there was NO street noise!! Also excellent wifi!The windows are floor to ceiling glass -- and while I wish I had the Empire State Building view -- it was lovely nevertheless. The armoir hanging space is limited, but the unit is very efficient. Bathroom was terrific, sliding door not optimum but who cares? Bathroom was spotless, well appointed - water pressure not stunning, but passable. My room had a small kitchenette, which was also spotless and even had some dishes and utensils as well as a good size microwave. The restaurant and bar will be finished in a few months and I am sure it will be a great addition, as the decor of the hotel is lovely. I often stay in NYC and sometimes want my hotel to be walking distance from Penn Station. This hotel is a little farther from the station than I usually stay, but it is well worth 5 more minutes of walking....and I would certainly stay there again.

Things that could be done better: a coat closet or rack, luggage racks or someplace to put some clothing. One of the days we had horrible rain and there was no place to hang up the 4 wet jackets we wanted to hang to dry. We also found it hard to find a place to put our toiletries.. a small shelf or two would have been great.The business centre and free wifi are nice touches as is the morning coffee bar.

My experience is different, and I would probably not stay there again. First the pros: hotel is clean, lobby area is gorgeous, and staff are friendly although not necessarily efficient. I booked a standard king-sized bed room for 7 nights, expecting a good-sized room with no frills but everything in working order. What I got was a tiny room with problems every single day for the first 4 days of my stay. Here is a list of issues I encountered with Lesoleil and that were not resolved to my satisfaction. 1 – I arrived early and room was not ready. I left my luggage and was told they would be at my room when I arrived. They were not. I came down to get them, instead of waiting for staff to bring it up, which was smart in retrospect because: it took 10 minutes for somebody to show up to get my luggage and when I got it, it was not my luggage! I had to come down to the basement to get my stuff, which would probably would be much worse if the wrong luggage was put into my room or delivered to me. 2 – Room was tiny, but well designed. Yet, no amount of good design will change the fact that there was barely enough space to open a large suitcase and that I had to put the bathroom robe and umbrella at the top of the armário to make space for a couple of suits and three shirts. Couldn’t fit anything else in the hangers, so had to leave shirts folded and iron them day by day instead of having one ironing session. Also, it was really fun trying to open the ironing board in the tiny room.3 – Bathroom flooded. Room was brand new and I certainly did not expect it. It was resolved swiftly, though. 4 – A friend dropped an important envelope for me at the hotel, and sent me a note saying it was there. I asked for it but the staff repeatedly said there was nothing for me. It was a tense 10 minutes, as I was trying to get hold of my friend while the staff finally remembered there was another place where the envelope could be. Of course it was there.5 – I had to ask three days in a row for coffee mugs. I had them in the first day, used them, the cleaning staff took it and did not replace it till the fourth day, even after daily requests. Minor detail, as there were paper cups in the room, but if I am going to have horrible Keurig coffee, at least I would like to do that in a proper mug. 6 – Elevators cannot handle the number of people moving around. There is no service elevator, so the two lifts have to handle all staff and guests moving around. At 20 floors with 8-10 rooms per floor, it simply did not work well. I lost a lot of time simply waiting for the elevators to bring to and from my room. All in all, I paid way too much for a tiny room with some design flair and friendly staff. For U$50 more per night I could have stayed at the Astoria, but I usually like executive hotels. Spacious, no frills, comfortable. I don’t mind the lack of a bar or restaurant in the hotel. I was not looking for luxury but comfort. In the end, I got neither.",Rio de Janeiro,"RodZ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong>",15,2.0

This was our first trip to New York and we had thought long and hard about where in the city we might like to stay, how much we were prepared to pay and the facilities we needed. Le Soleil proved to be an excellent choice. Being new everything was spotlessly clean and the staff keen to help. (Yes, Alfredo and Stanley - you deserve a mention for the warmth of your welcome!!) We were on the 17th floor with great views of the Empire State. Some reviewers criticise the rooms for being small but my understanding is that to get a large room in New York you would need to pay a lot more. We found the size perfectly adequate. The space was used well and we had enough drawer and wardrobe space to empty our cases and to move around quite comfortably. The bed and pillows were lovely and once we worked out the air conditioning system we were able to get the room temperature to one which suited us. The double glazing was very effective at keeping out any street noise. The bathroom was a good size with a great walk in shower.The location was good within easy walking distance of Macy's, Broadway, Times Square and Grand Central Station. There was a subway station just round the corner. Eating out in the area we found less good although there was a useful Pret a Manger across the road which was good for breakfast. For small intimate restaurants Greenwich would have been a better choice of area.

We would not be able to afford this hotel at it's regular rates. The hotel was right in central Manhattan only 5-10 minutes away from sights such as Times Square, the Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, Madison Square Garden and lots more. This was a great place to stay for a first trip to Manhattan because nothing was too far away.The lobby area was clean and staff were always attendant and polite - with GREAT customer service! Each person would say Good Morning / Hello and ask if there was anything that you needed or wish you a good day. This really made the hotel feel welcoming and less cold and corporate than most hotels I've stayed in. Checking in was quick.We stayed in an executive queen room on the 9th floor. The room was spacious and was and more than appropriate size for a couple travelling for a week - made up of an entrance area with 2 chairs and a TV, the bathroom, a table & chair with a giant mirror, and then the back area with the queen size bed and floor to ceiling windows! The bed was very comfortable. Bed sheets were fantastic. Next to the bed was an apple dock / clock with a charger which was useful and a nice addition. The TV was large and had lots of channels (It could also be used as an alarm clock!).The sliding bathroom door was a bit of a mystery as it appeared to have a lock fitted but no way to actually lock it ... not a massive problem for us but did mean the door was difficult to shut as it was rather heavy. The shower was lovely and modern with the glass panelling. All shampoos and soaps were replaced daily!Air conditioning in the room was great and simple to use! It was so easy to change room temp if I was feeling a bit hot or a bit cold.Ironing board and iron were welcome additions. Clever marketing of the hotel to place tasty looking cookies on the side as they are hard to resist every day! There was a coffee machine but a few english breakfast tea bags wouldn't have gone amiss!Our view out of the window was into another building. We did enjoy guessing what the people in the offices were working on! We did not mind this because we understand that Manhattan is a central hotel, surrounded by buildings. Our hotel room was also lovely and quiet, really relaxing after a day out in the busy city.When we checked out, our flight was not until later in the day. The hotel held our bags for us. We were really concerned about being over our weight allowance but a friendly member of staff weighed them with his 'experienced arms' and reassured us they were within the range! This was a small exchange but really made a difference and relaxed us!!Thanks for having us Executive Hotel Le Soleil.

A study in duality.First let me say that everyone on staff at Le Soleil was exceedingly helpful and courteous. My husband arranged this hotel for my birthday and called ahead to have flowers and balloons in the room on our arrival and they did a great job. There were balloons scattered around the room and a beautiful flower arrangement. The room itself and building overall were very clean and neat. I felt everything was fresh and hygienic. The building itself is warm and homey, not corporate cold. The location is perfect for access to all of Manhattans offerings.Combined with the friendly staff, I would almost say LeSoleil is ""inviting"" but this is where the ""buts"" start...Coming into the lobby, which is actually quite open and well appointed, we were a bit overwhelmed by the volume of the background music. We would have considered spending some time in the guest lounge if not for that. Check-in was however quick and friendly.We had reserved a ""Queen Suite with a View"" for a premium price so we had some expectations that, sadly, we're not met there as well.Initially we noticed a lack of ""surface space"" in both the sitting area of the room as well as the sleeping area. The list of conveniences, comforts and options that missed the mark is a little long so bear with me.There wasn't a luggage valet so we had to make due with balancing our suitcase on the ironing board or access our luggage kneeling on the floor. The one desk area where was nearly unusable as half the surface was setup with a Keurig Coffee maker and all the coffee making accessories and products. More of the space was stocked with a small grocery of snacks at premium prices. $6.00 for a travel snack sized Pringles chips? Really?The sitting area also lacked usable surface space. Had we chosen to celebrate my birthday with champagne in the room, we would have been hard pressed to find table space for the bottle and glasses. It's more disappointing because the room wasn't inconveniently small so the limited surface space wasn't a matter of avoiding crowding, just poor planning.The bed was actually quite comfortable BUT the pillows were almost useless. They were down pillows that compressed almost flat when we rested our heads on them. We actually ordered up an additional set of pillows, making a total of 7, but it didn't help much at all. With the TV on the wall at the foot of the bed, it was quite difficult to find a comfortable reclining position to watch as it felt like the pillows melted away into nothing when the least amount of pressure was applied. Stiff necks for all. Returning to the concept of hygiene, the bathroom felt quite clean but also fell short on some conveniences. Water pressure was woefully inadequate.A placard describing the building as Eco-friendly was a convenient excuse but a different shower head would have compensated. A sliding door would also have been nice. Having to step fully into the shower stall to turn on the water, taking the initial flow of cold water right in the face wasn't a pleasant experience. And back at the bedside, one side of the bed offered a clock with built in USB charging port and an Apple lightning charger dock but the other side had no matching convenience or an accessible outlet to plug our own chargers into. I know that sounds small but in the age of smart phones, iPads and Kindles, this really does seem more necessity than convenience.But, given all this, I will still give three out of five just for a super friendly and helpful staff, location and overall cleanliness.",,FinchLady,2,3.0

I would stay here again anytime. The staff are amazing and the hotel is very clean and located in a perfect position to reach all sides of New York without the noise of the busy street.We were originally checked in to a room on the 10th floor (overlooking the street) with a Queen size bed which would've been great if the room was bigger. We have a 19 month old baby and needed a cot in the room which was supposedly arranged on booking.However when we saw the size of the room there was no space for our luggage, buggy and a cot, it was really a tiny room with a big bed in it.I went downstairs and spoke with the reception and the guy showed me an executive suite on the 11th floor (facing offices not the street).Now this was a good size suite but sadly it only had a king size bed in it, however it was a sacrifice i was happy (being 6'2"" a big bed is needed) to make so that my toddler had some room to move about in. And two large flatscreen tv's.They allowed us this suite at no extra charge, very kind of them.They brought up a travel cot but left it for us to assemble ourselves which i thought was pretty bad form.The negatives about this place are...There are a lot of things that could improve the hotel, sadly they should have been done at construction stage.The whole design lay out of the rooms are pretty thoughtless from an architectural point of view.Wasted space in the bathroom with a huge shower that doesn't drain properly hence you're left standing in an inch of water and a shower that only reaches about a foot away from the wall so you end up trying not to head butt the wall while getting your hair/body wet.Also to have an executive suite with only a king size bed in it is a huge let down. Also something not considered at design stage.There is no 'grab handle' in the shower should somebody need it if they are unstable on their feet and no emergency cord should someone fall ( i thought this would be law).There are no glasses in the bathroom for when you brush your teeth to rinse with water. And something that i think is alien to New Yorkers, no toilet brush (Thankfully i never needed it). The sliding bathroom door was a real pain especially as it never had any kind of handle or finger holes to assist in sliding the big heavy door and it never even had a lock on it.Two bottles daily of complimentary water are pretty common in decent hotels these days and would be a nice touch.The hotel restaurant wasn't opening till November so i can't comment on the food.The above are all things that could be looked at but probably won't be.But as i said in the beginning, this is still a super hotel, you'd be crazy not to stay here.

While we can never compare the rate between a decent business hotel in NYC with one in Bangkok or even in Shanghai, we can always compare one and another within the same city or the same neighborhood.

And after having arrived on the spot, we knew we have made the right choice.The hotel meaning the lobby and the room, being newly opened was brand new. The Executive Queen, albeit compact but still a comfortable one. Being new, everything was in perfect condition. However, we honestly wish the room could have provided more spaces to unpack and to hang the unpacked clothing. And, I myself really wish the coffee maker inside the room was not a Keurig machine. A Nespresso or even a Dolce Gusto will be a better fit to the right image of the 4-star boutique property as the hotel define itself.Service-wise, it was friendly. The Concierge helped with unloading and keeping our luggages promptly and did not hang on for tipping was a pleasant first image. A Cup of cappuccino or other choice of premium coffee was offered when we checked in early and before our room was ready was a nice gesture as well. A nice and pleasant experience.

However, upon arrival (after an overnight flight from Vegas), very tired and hoping to check in several hours early, we were met by the some of the most friendly staff in NYC. Checking in early was not an issue and the lobby and decor of the hotel exceeded expectations for the price. There is also a small espresso cafe in the lobby if you want to grab breakfast on your way out. The location is great, less than a 2 minute walk to 34th St/Herald Sq Subway station, and the empire state building is 2 blocks over, there is also a great bar on the same side of the street as the hotel about 5 buildings down, reasonably priced drinks for Manhattan and a good atmosphere on a Saturday night.The room was outstanding, spacious and extremely clean. 2 big TV's, coffee, machine and in room safe. The bathroom was great, the shower was a large rainfall shower and having worked on a summer camp since April, this was probably my favourite facility. Obviously, this is a new hotel and much like a new home, there can be some teething issues, for example, on the power outlets by the bed, only the top outlet worked, not the end of the world and certainly didn't effect my stay, but on check out, I mentioned this, and the staff could not be more apologetic and told me they would get it fixed immediately, a great attitude and I have no doubt all minor issues will be sorted by the turn of the year, I must stress, no issue should take away the high standard and quality of this hotel, these are the things that happen when moving into a new building. Now the staff, a great collection of people that make it clear the guest is priority without being over the top. Should you need or want it, they will do everything in their power to have it done. Eddie worked in the lobby the weekend we stayed, met with a good morning when leaving for the day, offered a cab, recommended places and when checking out, organised our bags to be kept safe while we went out for the day as we had a late flight back to the UK. Eddie was also the first person we met when checking in very tired, he opened the doors for us with a smile on his face and set the standard for our stay with his courtesy. Joseph was another gentleman that worked the lobby over our weekend, both Eddie and Joseph worked on the day we checked out and while our bags were being retrieved to leave for the airport, we chatted to them and very friendly banter just added to the stay and made it personal as they asked about our time in the city. Just to add Joseph manged to carry my girlfriend's suitcase, my large backpack and several smaller back packs in one trip, a feat that I feel can't go unmentioned as it must have been about 70kgs all together. Overall, based on location, staff, cleanliness, room quality and general atmosphere and experience, you will be hard pushed to find a better stay in NYC for the price.

Overall, we had a pleasant stay. The lobby was welcoming, rooms were clean with nice amenities, and most of the staff were friendly and helpful (especially Eddie and Joe!). However, we did encounter a few glitches: Our originally reserved room had been changed / upgraded but we were not informed prior to or during check-in (hence we were somewhat confused once we saw our room.) Then our room was not cleaned one day by housekeeping; the drain in our shower did not work properly (almost flooded the bathroom floor twice); when we were exchanged to a different room, that was already occupied by another guest; Most of these issues were quickly dealt with by the front staff, and no doubt once the operational kinks are sorted out, Le Soleil will be worthy of a five star rating.","Edmonton, Canada","Msy88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",4,4.0

The hotel itself is beautifully presented but what really sets this hotel aside are the staff. Special shout out to Eddie at the front door and Chris on reception. You guys are amazing. With the majority of NYC hotels being so big and having massive lobbies the personal touch is often lost, not here. Oh did I mention the service? I really dont need to, the staff are just amazing. The only area which needed tweaking was housekeeping and how they operate but im sure that will be addressed or already has. The rooms are spacious and well presented and the amenities are up there ""the couples kit"" was a welcomed suprise lol.

The unique and beautiful art pieces and furnishings provided the hotel a relaxing and soothing atmosphere which is absolutely a pleasant experience to have especially after a long flight or journey. Every room has free wifi which is adequately fast so, one can can reply emails and continue doing work without interruption. There is also a business centre for work purposes if this is your preference. A good service worth mentioning is the hotel provides transport to the airport at a fixed rate compared to the yellow cabs. So, if you want to save on transport costs this is definitely the service to use. Additionally, the staff are very warm, friendly and glad to provide assistance. I enjoyed receiving service particularly from a genuinely nice staff member named Yujie Yang. Alongside being dependable she provides exemplary service and I would recommend any visitor to seek her assistance whenever you need it. I also loved the fact that the hotel is centrally located in the heart of Manhattan where shops and restaurants are within a walking distance from the hotel. If you would like to go shopping, sightseeing or have any relaxing leisure time, there are iconic buildings and places such as the Empire State building, Times Square and parks nearby. A visitor has the absolute freedom and options to choose whatever they want because everything is easily available and accessible.Despite my overall pleasant stay, there were only a few problems experienced which is expected in every case. Generally, the service is slow and the hotel's restaurant is not operational till December. So, one cannot have their meals in the hotel and access services such as room service, instead you would have to go outside the hotel to get a decent meal. Aside from the few problems, I enjoyed my stay at the hotel and will definitely return there when I visit NYC the next summer.","Saint George Parish, Grenada","Njeri M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint George Parish, Grenada</strong>",3,4.0

Here is what I think of this hotel:Pros(1) The quality of the room is quite good and the bed is comfortable. The room size is not bad consider it is in NYC. (2) The location is very good. Cons(1) This one really upset me. I booked this room at Expedia and I put three guests when I reserved it. I got a executive queen room. However, when I read the fine print, it said only one queen bed and no extra bed can be added and I got really curious how they are going to fit three adults in that room. So I called and they said they couldn't find a sofa bed and because of that they would give us two rooms instead. Then, I was like ""great"" and did not cancel the reservation (I could still cancel it at that point). When I arrived and began to check in, this guy told me that I only had one room and only one person could stay in that room. I explained what I was told before and the conversation went on for a while; however, at the end he said there was nothing he could do about it and his attitude was not helpful but condescending instead. I was furious at the moment, so I went talking to the manager. Surprisingly, the manager was completely opposite and very helpful and after explaining our situation, he was able to find two rooms for us. I was relieved but I should not have experienced this in the first place. The first guy that I talked to never apologized and he sounded so unhelpful during our conversation. His manner will not be an asset but a liability to this hotel. (2)There were also hit and miss when it came to room service. One of our room had no room service one day (not because we put a sign on the door) and the bath floor mat was missing in my room one day. Also, I asked for late check out but they inactivated my key card before the new check out time, so I needed to go down and told them to activate again. (3) I know it is a new hotel, so it is understandable that it needs touch up here and there. But some obvious things like tape residue on the elevator door can be easier peeled off. So why don't some stuff do something about it??Overall, it is not a bad hotel but I am NOT ""4-5 stars"" impressed mainly due to some incompetent staff working there. Hopefully, it will get much better 2-3 months from now.","Athens, Georgia","kelvinfrog</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Athens, Georgia</strong>",2,3.0
