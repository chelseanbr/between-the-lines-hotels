Quieter than other mainstream areas in Tokyo but everything you need in terms of facilities and a great vibe about it. Easy 30 min access to everywhere in Tokyo. Hotel is excellent. Staff brilliant. We stayed in Skytree room- superb views to the tower and beyond at day and lit up at night. Room was great 28sqm- good size for Tokyo. All in all first class and they even organised luggage transport to next hotel for a small fee Circa 14stg a bag.

After arriving in Haneda airport from US/Canada, it was a quick trip via the Airport Limousine Bus with a stop right at the front door of the hotel. This convenience can’t be overstated as after a long flight, you don’t want to have to navigate the hectic Tokyo subway transfers on arrival day. Especially if you are coming in during the rainy season like we did, you don’t want to worry about dragging your luggage in the rain. It is much better with the direct bus drop off.As some have complained, the rooms are not large by US/Canadian standards. But that’s expected for a large metropolitan city. We booked a quad room and it was a bit of work to move luggage around during the night/morning to get clothes for next day. Since we were seldom in the room as we spent most of the time exploring the city, the smaller sized room was not a big issue.The additional charge breakfast was a great value considered what you get. Be sure to add that as part of your online reservation with the booking web site. It’s considerably less expensive when breakfast is added as part of the room cost versus having to pay when you are there. For the people that complained in their review that the breakfast is repetitive, the answer is yes and no. There are changes daily but it’s subtle like types of fish changes or type of pastries may change after couple days. But there is enough variety to choose from even for a 6 night stay. You just need to leave the comfort zone of always have to eat the more western style breakfast. I picked between western and eastern style breakfast daily and had plenty to eat.To save money, we didn’t get the sky tree view rooms but you can just walk right outside of the hotel and take a picture down the street. The hotel has sky tree discount tickets that you can buy at the front desk to save few dollars off of the sky tree if you plan to go to the top. We just did a leisurely walk to the Sky tree on next morning after arrival just to get a feel of Tokyo street vibe. It’s a simple 25 minute walk.There are numerous restaurants just across the street as well as by the metro station 3 blocks away. If you buy the 24/48/72 hour Tokyo metro pass (sold at front desk as well as many Tourist offices), you can go to many places in Tokyo with the pass for a set price. The hotel is located on the east side (more historical side) so if you are more interested in Asakusa/Ueno/Tokyo station (for transfer to the Shinkansen), this hotel is in a great spot. Shibuya is 30 minute away on the Hanzomon line with no transfers. Shinjuku is 30 minutes away on the JR’s Chuo line so it’s not like you are hours away from the center but if you insist to stay next to the action places, then this place is not for you. For me, it’s good to stay in the quieter neighborhood after a hectic day of sightseeing and fighting the crowd.Lastly, I appreciate hotels that respond to my inquiries prior to arrival and I emailed Tobu many times prior to arrival and they were always prompt in their reply. They even left a note at the check in that I was interested in purchasing a 72 hour Tokyo pass as I had inquired about it previously in my email so that’s part of good customer service.Overall, this is a good value for your stay, especially if you have family of 4 as not too many Tokyo hotels have 4 beds in a room and with its location/breakfast/value for money, I would highly recommend Tobu for your Tokyo stay.","Half Moon Bay, California","Harryfat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Half Moon Bay, California</strong>",11,5.0

The ride on the coach there and back was lovely.The hotel will also book any hotel to airport coach transfer on your behalf; we really appreciated this service as we expected to be lugging luggage on the trains to the airport.

It's probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed at, if not the best. It's a lot bigger than I thought it would be. It's also in a busier neighbhood (in a good way) than I thought it would be. I stayed here for 4 nights towards the end of March.Pros:-Views - we paid around $15 USD extra per night so that we could get a room with a view. Let me tell you, this is probably the best $60 I've ever spent because the views do not disappoint. The Skytree is dead center of your window. It's nice to have something to look at when the jetlag hits and you're up at all sorts of crazy hours-Toiletries - little toiletries were refilled everyday, like toothbrushes, combs, razors, body scrubbers, and slippers. They even have Shiseido hair/body products in the shower-They had this fabric spray/sanitizer which worked wonders on my clothing. It refreshed it and even got out the wrinkles, so I was able to save myself from ironing anything-Smart phone - you can use the smart phone during your stay, which gives you internet and you can bring it out. So it comes in handy if you didn't get a pocket wifi. There's also free local/room to room calls so if you're traveling with someone staying in the hotel, have them bring their phone out too and you'll be able to reach them-Breakfast - this is an additional 20 USD, but you should treat yourself to the breakfast at least once. It's a Japanese breakfast buffet, so they have a little bit of everything: omelette station, rice, curry, noodles, soup, fruits, even a soda machine with about 10 different Japanese sodas. And these are only about a third of the available items-Water - two free water bottles each day-Shower pressure was great-5 minute walk to the train (Hanzomon Line/Sobu Line) - getting everywhere was super convenient. This neighborhood is a good jumping point if you want to explore other neighborhoods. Shinjuku is about a half hour away; so is Ginza-Lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. There's a Daiso that's a 5-minute walk away. 7-Eleven and Lawson's is right across the street. There's a supermarket 5 minutes away if you want to buy Japanese snacks/food products to bring home-They have a Yamato service counter in the lobby from 8 AM to 12 PM, so you can drop your luggage off right in the lobby, and they'll arrange to send it to your next destination. It's nice to not have to drag your suitcase around, especially on the ShinkansenCons-Rooms are a bit small, but I feel this is standard to Japan. I've probably been spoiled with large American hotel rooms-Bathroom doors open outward, which is a bit weird but I guess it makes sense since the bathroom is also small-Because the rooms are small, windows in the room can get steamy if you take a hot shower because there's really nowhere for the steam to escapeAs you can see, the list of pros is a long one, and the list of cons aren't really anything serious. I would love to stay here again the next time in Tokyo. However, I think I would want to stay in a different neighborhood - not because I didn't like this one, but more so because I would want to get a feel of what other areas of Tokyo are like.","New York City, New York","therealmeltam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",327,5.0

Although we were not close to the heart of Tokyo, we were around the corner from the Kinshicho station which was so easy to travel to anywhere we wanted to go. So, the value in this hotel was the quality for the price, location close to a major station, free shuttle to Disneyland/Disneysea, free rental of Handy phone for maps, etc., 2 bottles of water provided each day. All these things add up to significant savings especially when you have more than one room. Overall, I asked my daughter and her friend if they would stay here again if they returned to Tokyo and they said definitely.

I stayed 2 nights and things were really just average. The location is pretty good. Overall I wouldn't say Kinshicho is the most convenient neighborhood in Tokyo to be based in, but the hotel is less than a 10 minute walk to both Kinshicho train and metro stations, which was convenient. Nearby are plenty of convenience stores and restaurants. Like some other reviewers noted, there is some adults only nightlife in the evenings in this neighborhood, but it isn't visible in the immediate vicinity and it doesn't feel unsafe next to the hotel. Checking-in was quick and pleasant. They seem accustomed to English-speakers and other foreign guests. The lobby interior was bright and pleasant. My room had 2 twin beds and it was about average in size for this type of hotel in Japan. Everything seemed clean. The free wifi seemed adequate. The TV was ok, 2 English language channels. The AC/heater was easy to use. I appreciated the 2 free bottles of water a day. The ""Handy"" brand free smartphone was useful, even though the user interface is quite clunky and sometimes laggy. The free coffee didn't taste very good, and finding a place to plug-in the big water heater was actually a bit difficult. Not a big issue however.The bathroom was somewhat of a good surprise. Although the toilet is slightly too close to the sink, the overall size of the bathroom is slightly above average compared to other Tokyo hotels. And the bathtub is a decent size. I really appreciated that this bathroom actually has some space for your toiletries next to the sink. I just wish that they provided hand lotion. The shampoo and body wash/gel seemed pretty good.Unfortunately, 2 big problems ruined the stay for me. First, the bed was quite hard and my back was actually aching a bit when I woke up everyday. Also, there were 2 types of pillows offered, but I didn't notice much of a difference. They were both too hard and somewhat uncomfortable. The 2nd big problem was the fact that my room faced multiple train tracks, so it was super loud about every 10 minutes as the trains passed by, sometimes multiple ones simultaneously. The first time that I heard it, I actually thought that it was a monsoon storm pouring down torrential rain, which was not the case. This quickly got old and stressful. I called the front desk and complained about the noise. I asked to move to another room, but they claimed that they were all full. Perhaps this was true, but I was very dissatisfied that they could not offer another solution. If you come here, you should definitely bring earplugs, and even then, it may not be enough. At least checking out on the last day was very easy. Overall, the Tobu wasn't that bad, but given the 2 major issues, I would not come back again. If you're a light sleeper or have back problems, you should avoid this place.","Kirkland, Washington","GMK1954</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kirkland, Washington</strong>",71,3.0

The breakfast buffet has a large spread with both western and Japanese food and their diner buffet isn't bad either.

We stayed there for five days on the front end of our recent visit, and for four days on the back end. What a great find!There is a shuttle bus that runs from Tokyo Airport directly to the hotel which makes your travel quite easy. But we took the local train and it cost much, much less. Plus, we didn't have to wait for the bus. Ask for help finding the right train which leaves directly from the airport and you will find this is by far the best way to get to the hotel. The hotel is only a block from the Kinschicho Train station which provides easy access to the entire Japanese train system, including Tokyo Station where you can catch the bullet trains. And there is a Starbucks and a WI-Fi cafe in the station.The Tobu Levant is a luxury style hotel without the luxury price. In fact, they have all sorts of different levels of rooms at various prices, from economy to luxury. We settled on a standard double facing the Sky Tree Tower and the price was significantly cheaper than every other place we looked at around the sprawling city.The rooms are typical of Japanese hotels and quite small. But they are clean and attractive with all the amenities, including a free cellphone that you can use during your stay. And many of the views from this high rise hotel are quite stunning.The hotel staff is gracious, friendly, knowledgeable, and they treat everyone like royalty. The hotel itself looks like a luxury hotel in every respect, including the doormen.The hotel is located on the east end of town near the Sky Tree Tower, one of Tokyo's most prolific buildings. There are many restaurants all around the hotel, including a 24-hour automated place for when the jet lag kicks in and you are wide awake in the middle of the night during your first few days. and there is a 7-11 and a Lawsons within sight of the hotel where you can buy beer, wine, liquor, and great takeout.The hotel is located in the Sumida part of town which is comprised of quiet neighborhoods, so it's a great place to relax after a busy day of sightseeing. There are shopping malls around the hotel and at the Sky Tree Tower complex which is within easy walking distance. There are game arcades and bike rental shops across from the hotel. And there is a large urban park (Sarue Onshi) three blocks away where you can stroll through lovely gardens. And two blocks in the other direction there is an amazing greenway lined with ponds and waterfalls that runs all the way to Sky Tree. The hotel has a very nice atrium dining room and most evenings there is musical entertainment. And the hotel is connected directly to a shopping mall filled with stores and some great restaurants. If you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Tokyo; spend time in a lovely Japanese residential area; and have access to a huge range of attractions, museums, transportation, shopping, and eateries, without paying a lot of money, the Tobu Levant is an excellent place to stay during your visit to Tokyo.For more travel tips, please check out my popular travel blog.","Annapolis, Maryland","Steve C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Annapolis, Maryland</strong>",407,5.0

There were many choices from the breakfast buffet spread.I heard the property was in the red light district (or was it formerly one?) but we felt safe walking around the neighbourhood, even if we were 4 women. There were convenience stores around and many restaurants and a shopping area nearby as well.The Kinsicho Station is just two blocks away, providing easy access to go around the city. We took the Keihin Kyuko airport bus to Kinsicho and just had to walk to the hotel. We got our airport bus tickets conveniently from the front desk on the day of our departure for Haneda Airport.Will definitely recommend this hotel, especially for bigger groups and families.

Upon arrival, we were told that my 7 year old child has to pay the full price equivalent that of 1 single room for the next 8 nights even if he is sleeping with us without an extra bed - no negotiation. This was very upsetting because in Expedia, it clearly showed that the room can accommodate up to the 2 adults and 2 children. We also paid for a twin room with an additional sofa bed (total 3 beds).Fortunately we contacted Expedia through a relative in Singapore and very quickly, Expedia contacted them and we were allowed to be charged for the price of an extra bed instead. We have to accept since it is a ""more reasonable"" rate. However, our room was not changed and there were no additional bed in the room.Having started on a sour note from an overnight flight, we put that behind us and decided that it should be a great holiday.Tobu Hotel on general is situated in a very good location - one word - CONVENIENT. There were amenities, eateries, a number of supermarkets, and most importantly, connected to JR station and Tokyo subway. This helped planning travels and visiting attractions a lot easier.The Hotel is old but clean. The rooms are big for Japan standard, each bed is bigger than a twin but smaller than queen, good sized toilets with bath tubs and easy to control shower. Provided generous supplies of toiletries, towels, hangers etc. The sofa bed was initially very thin and hard, we got the housekeeping to add a layer of mattress over it and it was fine after first night. Provided a mobile device in each room for guests' navigation, though we did have our own data card. Unfortunately WIFI was not fantastic, weak or no signal when many guests are hooked on. They can't do anything about it. We had missed packing our power adapters and they were able to help us with that.Breakfast had a good spread but as all other comments you read here, served the same every other single day. On a day we could not make it for breakfast, they packed some juice and croissants for us to take on our journey.They had free Disneyland/Sea shuttle buses to take you to/fro. However, very important to reserve your seats and make sure your name is on the list. They were so strict with all these paperwork!In summary, our family enjoyed ourselves tremendously in Tokyo.

I would like to Thank You the conceige desk agent **Natsumi KohJoh** Excellent Customer service. Even though I won't get this service from a 5 star hotel, maybe a bellboy will approach to you.

Food court on the 10th floor.. Lots of choices and reasonable price. And they closed around 10pm. Also you got 7 eleven. Lawson and family mart.. For breakfast. There is Starbuck. Excelsior Cafe and Tully coffee. We have booked a Skytree view on 20th floor. Nice view. We stay in this hotel for 7 days. But we are not able to see the green color for the Skytree. We did see the blue purple and brown color. Room is very spacious and really like they do have a floor lamp underneath the cabinet which makes it more easier to go to the washroom at night. They also come with a bottle of spray freshener or Odour free which you can spray on your clothing or jacket especially when you finished BBQ or heavy smell food. They also comes with a fridge and safe. The shower is very strong. And the mattress is quite okay firm. But is almost time to change before the Olympic starts next year. Ice machine is located near the elevator. And there is vending machine and tobacco vending machine on the ground floor. Basically you got everything you need for staying in this hotel.

It is recommended to book in advance though in case the bus is full. I booked it online before the trip. Very convenient! It is also a stone’s throw away from Kinshichō station which makes public transport easily accessible. We took the train on some days. Beside the train is a shopping mall which you can find almost everything you need in it like a supermarket, drug store, Uniqlo, Daiso, kids departmental store, food etc. McDonald’s and Starbucks are also available there if you crave for some non Japanese food. We also tried some eateries opposite the hotel. You can find ramen, bbq food, Japanese bentos, 7-11 etc there. Burger King and Yoshinoya are along the same street too. Spoilt for food choices. You can also book a limousine bus to/fro airports or choose to take JR line to hotel if your luggage is manageable. The hotel is also very clean. We will definitely stay at this hotel again !

It is amazing how they will go above and beyond to help you in any queries you may have e.g. where is the nearest eye doctor. On the same example, they will help you to make appointment and print out map to show how you can reach your clinic. What can you say but just,"" Wow"". The conditioning of the hotel may not be the best I have personally seen but I must say the cleanliness of the place is no different from those from 5 stars hotel! Considering their tenure in the hotel industry, I must say they are top of their class to be able to maintain such high standard.Like every establishment there are rooms to grow. I would love to see them change their breakfast buffet menu. For those who only had it only once, you will be happy with their varieties. To have to eat 9 days of breakfast with the same menu is not a pleasant experience. The other suggestion that I like to make is to request the hotel to provide portable vaccum cleaner. This is extremely useful for travelers who uses vaccum bag to pack their clothes to make sure there are space for buying more things in their luggage!

A 7-eleven and Lawson stores are located across the street which makes stocking up on essentials easy as pie. There are plenty of eateries and bars in the area (particularly around the back streets) and Kinshicho Station is just up the road. When arriving at the station I would advise travellers to take the north exit. All you then have to do is walk westwards down the road. Public transport is very easy. We flew in and from Haneda which is straightforward. We found the easiest way to see most of Tokyo was to take the Sobu Local Lineto Akihabara, and then transfer to the Yamanote Line. The Sobu Line itself goes all the way to Shinjuku. The Hamzomon metro goes to Shibuya. It’s effortless.

Needless to say, we were not disappointed. This hotel is located 3-5 min walking distance from Kinshicho station which has both subway and JR train (Sobu line direct to Narita, without transfers for 1,350 yen) and it takes about 20 to 40 min to get to other areas of interest inside Tokyo. There is a Limousine bus direct from Narita to the hotel but it's only offered twice a day. This hotel also offers a free shuttle bus to and from Tokyo Disneyland which is great if you have little kids, specially on the way back when they are tired. You can also buy Disney tickets at the front desk and skip the 30 minute ticket line at Disneyland (keep in mind that the hotel does not sell fixed-date Disney tickets, which we did not mind, since the crowd forecast was good mid-week)Our room was spacious for Tokyo standards and contained every known gadget and necessity. The cleaners were excellent and very detailed. There was an ice machine in the hallway. The TV offered mostly Japanese TV with one channel that had occasional English news. We were also offered an android cell phone which had unlimited data and voice and was indispensable for google maps and street directions. You could also download apps from Google Play - we downloaded google translate, Tokyo subway app and TDR Alert for Tokyo Disney wait times. The phone's user interface was a bit clunky and ad-supported, but it was a great free service by the hotel. The mattresses were comfortable. There was just a bit of outside noise from the trains and some minor noise from people passing in the hallway, but no different than most places. The email communication with the hotel prior to our arrival was prompt and all of our many questions have been answered in great detail. Everyone from cleaning staff, managers, concierge and the front-desk staff were very polite, knowledgeable and always very helpful. There are 2 convenience stores (Lawson's and 7 Eleven) right across the street from the main entrance and 2 french bakeries (one in the train station and the other one next to the southern entrance) There are many restaurants on the side streets and an entire floor of family friendly restaurants on the 10th floor of the nearby Arcakit shopping center. In case it rains, you almost don't need an umbrella and can go strait from terminal 2 of the train station to the Arcakit shopping center which has hotel access on the second floor (west gate). If it doesn't rain there is a big park nearby (Kinshi park) that has a playground for kids. Across the street from the Kinshicho station (east side) there is an escalator access to the basement of the Rakutenchi building with a big supermarket that's affordable and has a pastry section and a large take-away food section with a very large inventory of prepared foods and sushi. Rakutenchi building also contains several restaurants and fast food places (including KFC and a Subway) as well as a 24/7 onsen (spa) on the 9th floor. Overall - this was a great choice and gets five stars for location, service, convenience and for solving a lot of issues tourists face in Tokyo.","Willoughby, Australia","jovicic</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Willoughby, Australia</strong>",75,5.0

The hotel lobby is lovely and the staff were all excellent. Room amenities were plentiful. We were on the side overlooking the railway tracks, you can hear a bit of train noise but it was not particularly bothersome - I am a light sleeper, foam earplugs did the trick. Otherwise no noise from the hallway or adjoining rooms at all. For travellers arriving from Narita Airport, if you can figure out the train system, you can actually get a direct train from the airport to the station next to the hotel. The hotel is located in a relatively quiet area of Tokyo, I absolutely loved the area and with the station so close, everywhere is easily accessible. There are plenty of bars and restaurants near the hotel and a big shopping centre right next door. Go to the roof of the shopping centre for a great view of Skytree and surrounding suburbs. Skytree is just over a kilometre away, and a very enjoyable walk along relatively quiet streets. The hotel offer a ticket deal where you can visit two levels of Skytree at a discounted price if you go before a certain time in the morning. I highly recommend this, we got there just after 8am and virtually had the place to ourselves. I would especially like to thank this hotel for organising a refund for one night of our pre-booked stay after our airline cancelled our flight, delaying our arrival by a day. We did not think this would be possible due to the short notice and it was totally appreciated as we discovered our travel insurance excludes flight cancellations from their cancellation policy.

I spent most of the day out and about, so I didn't need much of a room or luxuries. The hotel seems to be luxuriously decorated and the appliances and room decor are excellent and well maintained.My room was the smallest room I've ever been in, which was ideal for this trip. Through the door was a short hall the length of the bathroom and then the room which was mostly the queen or full size bed. There was a desk/counter space along the foot of the bed (at the end of the hall) with a TV, phone, and lamp. Then along the one side of the bed near the window was a chair, air purifier, and end table. The head board extended from the bathroom wall (the bed was flush with the bathroom wall and headboard) to the window and contained controls for the room lights and a reading light. The bathroom was average sized with a deep tub/shower and a toilet with the Japanese bidet seat. The room was the perfect size for the type of trip I was on, efficient and comfortable without the luxurious space.The hotel contained a rooftop bar was formal and quiet, charged an seat/entrance fee. They did give us an appetizer (?)... an un-appetizing cracker with a sardine (?) and pate concotion. I was not a fan. There were bars up and down the street in front of the hotel, so this was not a problem.The hotel restaurant contained a pretty decent breakfast buffet, but for the cost we only ate there once on our four night stay.The hotel was clean and quiet. The staff was courteous and spoke decent english.

There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the close area, as well as 7-11, Lawsons, and Family mart in close proximity.My least favorite part of this hotel is the hotel bar. It would have been nice to sit down for a beer with my friends after a day of exploration, but I felt compelled to order a scotch or bourbon or glass of wine and underdressed in anything but a suit and tie. It's a nice option to have the classy bar with the jazz band on the one night staycation with the wife or after the company function in the hotel, but I need the Cheers type beer bar with the jukebox or TV sports after a day of hiking or subway riding. Tocci is across the street and there are a couple of english pubs down by the station.Overall, I would definitely stay at this hotel again!",,RussellB1856,0,5.0

Quality of soap and shampoo are considered good quality compared to the average hotel in japan.In terms of service the staff and concierge are quite helpful and can speak very good English. The staff even printed out specific directions and cost for subway/train rides for us. When asked for an electric adapter they had it with no problem. If you need to leave your luggage when you check out and are waiting for a flight then no worries they will help you with that without any charge.Two great things about this hotel, first is that for both rooms we had a great view of the Tokyo Sky Tree [This is a must ask when you check it]. Secondly, location is really really good it's close by to Tokyo Metro Kinschicho Station so you are only a few stops a way from Asakusa and Ueno. Around the hotel are a lot of local restaurants [coin]. Across the street and on the 2nd floor of the hotel is also a Family Mart. Also right next door is Arcakit shopping mall which you can spend a few hours doing last minute or late shopping for Uniqlo, GU, Daiso, do some dining, snacks, deserts, super market, clothes, bags, Zara, and if your traveling with babies you're in luck because they have a whole floor/shop dedicated to baby supplies. So all in all this is a great place to stay at where everything you may need is in walking distance of no more than 250 meters.The only thing I would note is that check in and out are pretty strict so don't expect everything to be ready if you arrive at noon when check in time is at 2 PM [This is pretty standard and expected at all Japanese hotels].","Bangkok, Thailand","TheMLife</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",87,5.0

Also the Arcakit shopping centre is almost next door with heaps of shops and a great restaurant floor. We got a Standard Twin Room with extra bed for third person. We didn't get the Skytree view but looked out on the railway lines, which was very interesting, and we had a tiny glimpse of the Tokyo Tower.In case anyone is wondering the beds are essentially large single beds. You couldn't sleep more than one in each.Check-in was an absolute breeze. We came around 7pm from the airport and they were all ready for us. We had been expecting a package and they advised they had already sent it up to the room.The room was really comfortable with all the amenities you could think of needing in the bathroom, including a hairdryer, and every day they gave us three bottles of water to drink.We were out every day from early till late and didn't use any facilities in the hotel other than our room but it was always immaculately made up when we returned every night.We checked out fairly early (6.15am) and discovered there wasn't anyone on duty to get us a taxi except the guy on the front desk. He ran out into the street and tried to hail us one but eventually came back and said we should walk down to the station to try and find one.

Sky Tree view room is worth paying for!! You can see the Sky Tree right there in front of you when you open the window. Morning view and night view were different, and both equally beautiful. There are two different colors of Sky Tree lighting at night, and the color alternate every day. We were also lucky enough to see the fireworks up right next to the Sky Tree.This hotel is 4 minutes walk from/to the Kinshicho Station, one station away from the Sky Tree station (you can also walk there), two stations away from Asakusa station. Easy access to any Tokyo tourist areas, yet situated in more quiet downtown Tokyo.Hotel staffers were all very friendly and pleasant. Room was a bit small, but efficient and functional.

The hotel was easy to get to and from Haneda airport since it's on one of the airport bus routes. The staff was very helpful arriving, departing and during our stay, I noticed at one of the other hotel stops people were on their own standing outside waiting for the bus. The Tobu staff took our luggage and asked us to sit inside and they came and got everyone for the bus.The breakfast buffet has something for everyone and worth the price but if you get it included it's probably a little cheaper, other breakfast options are coffee shops in the shopping center at the train station. Not well advertised is there's a convenience store right outside the 2nd floor doors to the right and a Tulleys coffee shop to the left, also 2 convenience stores right accross the street. The meals served at the 2nd floor are all buffet style and the Skytree view restaurant/bar are set menus from what I can tell, the only ala carte menu is the coffee shop on the 1st floor but there are loads of places near the hotel.The Kinshicho train station is nearby and a lot of stores and restaurants are in that complex, Skytree up the street about 1km walk but we took a taxi for about $7 but i'm old and lazy. Plenty of taxi's if your late for a meeting..... & the hotel will get one for you. I noticed they provide a free Disney shuttle bus also which is great if that's where you're headed and i'm keeping that in mind for the future. They also had other tours through a bus company but you need to book in advance unless you like riding the train and walking alot, hey some people do for the adventure.The room and amenities were good and the price was resonable, we booked direct thru the hotel website online since this trip was a last minute thing. The website in English is a little off but you get the idea, I emailed them a question and got a prompt answer. (If they need help with that english website I can help) lol. We couldn't get the in room wifi to work and there was a notice in the room that no tech support is available but since we have local phones it wasn't an issue for us, didn't use the wired connection.Overall the Tobu Levant is a pretty good hotel considering price, accessibility and services provided, we'll be staying here again.","Chatan-cho, Japan","kurti38</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chatan-cho, Japan</strong>",49,4.0

It was wonderful.The only negative (which has been well documented in other reviews) is the lack of casual seating in the foyer. There is seating available at certain hours but is intended for bar guests. It would have been perfect to meet business colleagues in the foyer instead of having to walk to a nearby coffee shop.The hotel is only a few minutes walk from the Kinshicho JR station. In fact, when it is raining, you only have to walk outside for a short distance and can cut through the shopping mall! It is then 3 stops to Tokyo station. There is also a local metro stop about 5 mins walk away.Tips: When you book, request a room: • Facing the Skytree.• High up• On a non-smoking floor (if you don’t smoke)Upon check in, ask to borrow a router. The internet connection is unreliable and frustrating. Far better to borrow a router at the start of your stay and have a reliable service. They also lend electricity adaptors for people like me who forget to bring them!If you are going to need a guidebook in a foreign language, then you must bring it with you (or take the train to a tourist information office elsewhere in the city.) Sumida is not the sort of area where you can purchase postcards or foreign newspapers. It is where Japanese people work and live. It is safe and very refreshing!Some of the hotel staff speak good English and try very hard to help but they were only able to provide a train/metro map in English. If you are going to be exploring, then consider buying a JR rail pass before you arrive in Japan for the best deal. I decided that as I would get lost countless times, I would purchase a combo 1 day ticket which covered the Metro & JR within Tokyo. It cost approx. 1500 yen and was worth it. Otherwise, you have to buy a ticket from the machines at each station which is confusing. The reception staff at the Tobu wrote a note in Japanese explaining what I wanted to purchase and I handed the railway ticket office clerk the same note each day! It was perfect.If you want to eat out, there are countless small restaurants in the nearby shopping mall for lunch. Otherwise, we ate at the Terzo3 Italian restaurant which is very close to the hotel and which we could see from the room.

My family and I loved how comfortable (and affordable) the rooms are. It might not be that luxurious but we still appreciate the comfort it gave us after long walks around Tokyo. The staff are friendly and can speak english. They also have a free shuttle to Tokyo Disney Resort that will save you from the pain of commuting to Chiba and rushing so you'd arrive there early. There's also a mall that's only a 3-minute walk away from the hotel, which is nice because we got to buy groceries and Japan goodies that we took home. Also, there's a restaurant just right outside the hotel that's very affordable, and a 7-11 too for quick midnight snacks. We'll definitely book here again on our next trip to Tokyo.","Manila, Philippines","Jea R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",6,4.0

If you have the money, go for either the Corner Twin or, better yet, the Deluxe Twin. Both will have wide double windows and the best views of the Sky Tree. The price will be either 50% more (corner twin) or double (deluxe twin) the price of a standard twin but your experience will be transformed from mundane to ethereal.Be sure your room faces the ST rather than the train station.Dinner at the top 24F restaurant Ren is a great choice. Lunchtime, the place looks a bit drab and feels boring absent the enchanted mood the place takes on early evening, or better yet, later when the Sky Tree is enshrouded in darkness, standing out like an enchanted tower in the distance. So dinner is my recommendation. But be sure to reserve a booth table facing the Sky Tree. The counter is less comfortable though with an equal view, and the tables up on the deck make it difficult to peer out at the view. To reserve, the best idea is to go up to the restaurant ahead of time, either lunch or before dinner, and ask the staff to save you one of the 4 or 5 booths with a good view. Staff is very accommodating and anxious to get the big hitters at night (which they anticipate u are if you're taking the trouble to reserve, but don't feel pressured to order something expensive from the mediocre wine list, as the staff is very polite).The 0.9mile 15 minute walk to the Sky Tree is rather boring, passing through a nondescript neighborhood which could almost be east LA w/o the graffiti. The walk in the summer could have you work up a good sweat so be prepared.You probably want to take the hotel up on its Sky Tree special passes so u can skip the long lines, but those are pricey. Hey, if you stay in the Deluxe or Corner Twin and plan to see the Tree, u may as well complete your premium package.This hotel was formerly a Marriott but Tobu took the hotel back as the Sky Tree was coming up. It is disappointing that there really is no better quality hotel in the Sky Tree area at this moment (eg, no room service or pool/exercise facilities), but I suppose the Mandarin Oriental in Nihonbashi offers a fabulous view of the tower from some of its rooms and restaurants facing east with the ST about a 15-minute cab ride away (10 minutes on a Sunday morning). Service and efficiency at the Tokyo Mandarin can be severely lacking at times though and so I avoid that overpriced office bldg-based complex.",Tokyo,"Kimo N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo</strong>",13,4.0

The staff was courteous and efficient. I checked in late at night after a long flight and the staff quickly got me checked in and into my room.The room, by my standards was compact, but certainly livable. It was clean and comfortable. One particular thing I liked about the room was the access to power - I travel with a lot of tech and need power. I've been in too many hotels that do a great job of hiding the sockets and making sure they're far away from where you need them.I do also have to add that the bathtub plumbing was completely incomprehensible to me - quite possibly this was a personal deficiency.A complementary breakfast was included, but I did not have time to take advantage of it, so I can't talk about the food there.I was on a high floor on the train station side - others have complained about the noise, but I had no problems with it. I suspect once above the first few floors you'll be ok. The other complaint was the smell. Like in many hotels in Europe and older hotels in the US, the non-smoking floors were converted which tends to leave a rather stale odor. I definitely noticed it here, but at least to me, it wasn't unbearable.They also seem to have some affiliation with Disney, so roving bands of Disney fans were seen roaming the lobby. If you're going to the DIsney park, this would be a plus.All in all, I was happy with the hotel, and will probably stay there again when I'm doing business in the area.","Kailua, Hawaii","spoggle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kailua, Hawaii</strong>",17,4.0

Just about everything that I ate was DELICIOUS.

We felt very well cared for. Any time one of us was seen wandering around looking a little lost, some one was there immediately to assist us. The location is great, near a bus and the Kinshicho train station and next to a mall with a food court, making it easy for even our diverse group to find food to make everyone happy. We could hear the trains during the day and early evening, but they seemed to stop at a reasonable hour and didn't interfere with sleep. I appreciated the deep bath tub after our 13 hour plane ride, and choice of pillows. The mattress was a bit firm for me, but my husband liked it. Kimonos and slippers were waiting for us in our rooms. Across the street is a view of the Sky Tower, and down a block what looks like a Shinto shrine, a little of old and new Japan. The breakfast buffet offers both Western and Asian breakfast choices. I tried a little of each type, and found all the choices to be good. I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend.","Ajijic, Mexico","Patricia G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ajijic, Mexico</strong>",20,4.0
