We choose the Granbell solely based on information on the internet.We choose well. The hotel is located a couple of minutes walk from Shibuya station in a quieter street away from the Shibuya crossing and all the neon lights.Our room included a two seater couch which we prefer to sit on rather than the bed.A big tick is the shower, a walk in shower separate to the bath.

So I was quite disappointed when I saw my room after checking in. The official photos are a little misleading.The bathroom was very tired and worn. The bathroom windows had this hideous green tint. The TV looked maybe 10-15 years old (it could easily pass as a computer monitor). After briefly lying on the bed, the bedsheets started coming out. It revealed an old mattress underneath. The hallways and the general hotel design was...strange. A host of mismatched colours scatter the walls and floors. While the lifts are a basic white colour on all surfaces. Some parts of the hallways are flooded with light, while other parts are very dim which can make it hard to see where you’re going. It looks like they were trying to go for a sleek stylish look but executed the idea terribly.Speaking of terrible, the WiFi was awful. Extremely slow. I ended up using my pocket WiFi as it was much faster. I’m not sure why they decided on individual WiFi routers in each room with their own WiFi connection name and password. It probably causes a lot of interference. You can easily guess the WiFi password of other rooms if you really wanted to. They all follow the same structure. In the end, the only stand out feature of this hotel was its proximity to the Shibuya shopping district. The front and back doors are a bit tucked away and easy to miss. While my overall stay was comfortable, given the the price, I probably wouldn’t come back again.","Sydney, Australia","TravelTrips12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",77,3.0

One of the main things is that the hotel does not allow early chekin.

The area is very happening. The vibes are great.The hotel is also 2-3 minutes walking to Shibuya JR station which connects to Airport as well. Room:The room was decent in size compared to thought of sizes of Tokyo hotels. The bed was comfortable, but after putting luggage, the space in room was crippled.The room connects to bathroom, with separate WC and a separate bathing area. The bathing area also boasts a bathing tub, which is sort of luxury of the space is a crunch. The view from the room window was a dead wall.Bathroom:The bathing water pressure was very high, it should be a little controlled as it can hurt someone.

Simply take the N’EX and the hotel is about a 5 minute walk from the train and subway station. It was a little bit tricky to find at first. The description on the hotel website didn’t really work for me. When you find the correct West exit at Shibuya station, make sure you have the JR office to your left. A little bit further to your left you’ll see a pedestrian bridge. Go up the stairs and descend the first set of stairs straight ahead. Do not turn right on the bridge and go down the stairs there. Walk straight ahead and turn right at the 24h restaurant (the building with the bid golden buddha). Walk up the slope for about 100 meters and the hotel is located on your left. The location was quiet. And I say this as a light sleeper who is very easily distribed by noise. The craziness of the Shibuya scramble is a good ten minute walk from the hotel, and none of that sound can be heard from the hotel. There are a bunch of subway lines passing throught Shibuya station which makes navigating the city very easy. The room was one of the smallest hotel rooms I’ve stayed in. People weren’t kidding when they said there was barely enough room for their suitcases. If all you’re looking for in a hotel room is a place to sleep then this is absolutely fine. But if you want a place where you can relax and just watch some TV or read, then this is not the hotel for you. There isn’t really enough room to sit comfortably. The bed, as just about always in Asia, was far too hard for my taste. I’ve said this in a bunch of reviews for other hotels, but for the life of me I can’t understand how people invest a lot of in hotels, buying continental beds but skimping on the top pillow mattress, which means that in essence you’re lying directly on top of the box spring mattress. If you don’t mind hard beds then this is absolutely fine. But if you, like me, beds a bit softer or more comfortable, then this is probably not the hotel for you. The breakfast was pretty basic and a bit of a letdown. I believe it was included in the cost for my room. But I would not recommend paying extra for it. So the location was great and quiet. But the deal breaker for me was the bed. I stayed at Shibuya Granbell for a week and had not a single good night’s sleep, which is the point of a hotel in the end. However, if you don’t mind hard beds and don’t plan on eating breakfast, this is a great place to stay.

GoogleMaps is also a bit unpredictable as you move around as well. It’s definitely a tourist hotel - no Japanese here - with mostly large beds (very few double twins) and some very small rooms. There’s a tiny closet for your clothes, small refrigerator, room safe and the regular accoutrements. The staff is very helpful, friendly and accommodating. I would give him high marks especially after our experience at the Granbell Kyoto. There is a small restaurant in front with average food but friendly staff and fast service. We found a nearby laundry for washing as the list prices for hotel service is quite outrageous. Breakfast is passable though it can be crowded in the morning.

It was a bit confusing figuring out where the hotel was when we arrived at Shibuya station. Just a tip - it's best to exit from the West entrance/exit as that's the closest to get to the hotel.The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful during our stay. They made dinner reservations for us in Kyoto as I don't know how to speak Japanese. They even called the hotel we were heading to; to let them know about our dinner reservations.The room like most hotels in Tokyo is quite small. However, it didn't bother us as we only went then to sleep, shower, and rest. What really turned us off was when we figured out the toilet was giving off a sewage smell. Upon leaving the toilet lid open one day, we noticed the washroom had a bad smell. We didn't know what it was until we were able to match the smell to a sewage smell when we were walking around the city. The only way to keep the smell from spreading is to keep the toilet lid closed and the bathroom. I didn't enjoy using the bathroom in the hotel.There is construction happening across from the hotel but it didn't bother us. They only work during business hours and during those times we were out and about anyways.I would recommend this hotel if you're staying in Shibuya as the price is fair.

The service and location definitely gives you bang for your buck. The location is definitely the best selling point of the hotel - a short 4 minute walk to Shibuya Station and surrounded by eateries. You’ll be right in the middle of the action. Still, rooms were quiet and we didn’t have issues with noise from outside, despite some construction happening across the road. The service was great and staff were very helpful. The hotel was modern and had all the amenities you will need. While room sizes are small, this is to be expected in Japan no matter where you go. The rooms were modern in their fit out and very clean. The bed was comfortable and there was some storage space, and the room used the space efficiently (we were in a modern double bedroom). My recommendation is to pack a small to medium sized suitcase when traveling in Japan for this reason. My only complaint was the breakfast, which was quite limited and only had a small selection of dishes. If you’re considering booking with breakfast I’d say go without - I’m sure you’ll find better options right around the corner from where you are. Otherwise, I’d recommend the Shibuya Granbell Hotel!

The room was fairly basic and cozy, but I felt the standard of amenities were above what one would expect for the price I paid - especially in a large modern mega-city such as Tokyo. I was provided with bottled water, fresh toiletries (toothpaste and toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, body wash and shower sponge, comb, toilet paper). These were replaced as required when the room was serviced each day. The room was serviced each day between 11am and 2pm. I was very happy with the standard of cleanliness provided each day. It was like coming back to a whole new hotel room. The shower and the toilet were also very clean.Laundry service is available and your items will be returned to you on the same day if you give them to the front desk by 9am.A/C was provided in my room with settings between 19C and 30C.Free Wifi was provided. The internet connection was stable and fast. TV is also provided.The free breakfast is provided by Saku La Dining, and their morning buffet has a variety of different foods such as sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, french toast, rice, braised chicken and vegetables, cereals, fruit salad, soups and fish. The man who runs the breakfast was very friendly. There is some construction going on at Shibuya Station, although I did not hear it at all from my room, which was on the 12th floor (I was in a room closest to the construction but perhaps being so high up prevented me from hearing it).A vending machine is provided in the hotel.It is close to Shibuya station. From there you can quickly get to other places in Tokyo and the wider area (eg, Narita airport, Ginza, Shinjuku, SkyTree, Odaiba even Yokohama!). Although on the way to the station you do have to navigate a somewhat narrow and inconvenient pedestrian overpass to go over (though it looks like it is in the process of being replaced by a wider pedestrian overpass so that may make things better). There are lifts though so if you get sick of climbing the stairs to go to and from Shibuya station each day or have lots of luggage, you can use that. Nearby are several conbini. the closest is a Family Mart just before the pedestrian overpass. Further up the hill and around the corner a bit is a 7/11 with international atms so you can get cash if needed. I also believe there is a Lawson near the 7/11.If you are a smoker/vaper like me, definitely get a smoking room as smoking/vaping wily-nily outside on the street is now frowned upon in Japan and the nearest outdoor smoking spot that I knew of is all the way by the Moyai statue at Shibuya station. An ashtray is provided (but for obvious reasons - DO NOT smoke in bed!) and replaced when the room is serviced.Overall, I was very impressed with the standards of this hotel and would definitely like to stay here again next time I'm in Tokyo.","Auckland, New Zealand","DionJamesPitman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",4,5.0

If you have a big suitcase prepare to haul it. It’s a little hard to find the entrance also. If you’re going up the street that it’s on, it’s on the left side between first a noodle shop and then a pizza place. The entrance is a giant wooden door set back a bit from the street. Front desk was nice and fast. The room was a decent size for Japan. Major problem though was the a/c. There is none. We called the front desk and they sent up a guy to use a tool to open the window. It was in the 40’s while we were there so it helped but......there is MAJOR construction on one side of the hotel that goes all night into the morning. Request a room away from this side because this project is nowhere close to being finished. The free breakfast was really good and they even have salad and soup! The location is great!

We could both access the bed on each side because it was not up against the wall... but it was a bit tight walking on my side of the bed. Room had a small fridge. 7-11 close by for drinks and snacks.

The rooms airconditioner was good. I am never a fan of particle board furniture but maybe I need to upgrade my room and pay more. I found the hotel staff a bit aloof and not really approachable, we were offered no information on where to find things. Found out later there might have been another door on the otherside of the hotel. The buffet breakfast, as mentioned by others, was pretty bad. During the day they make “pizzas” which I tried once with a beer. Very unfriendly place. The restaurant we never looked for or really knew where it was.

Shower was great. Air con was great too. Bed was comfy.What steals the show here however is the handy mobile device they give. I had broken my phone just before coming here and we couldnt use our phones in Japan due to the extortionate cost so when we saw these little things, boy did I jump for joy! Handysmart i think they are called and they are basically a mobile phone with internet, google maps etc that you can use internet for! Fantastic idea!The location is just the best. 5 minute walk to Shibuya crossing and the train station. The bus station is confusing as heck though.Also, if you want to go to mount fuji, there is a bus at the Silver Mark City (i think thats its name) that takes you there and back. Book online if you can. Save money.The breakfast. Ok there are two options. A buffet that was just pointless (we saw it and just walked back out), they had nothing of note there. The second is the restuarant. We used it once and, top service from the very friendly Japanese staff but it was not really all that great.

The bathroom took up nearly the same amount of space as the room and is separated by a glass wall. What I didn’t like about the room was that the bed faces the see through bathroom, which means the room has a view...of the toilet. Apart from that I found my room quiet, something I always appreciate. I tried breakfast in both of the restaurants. To say that they were minimal at best is an understatement.

They have another location in Shinjuku which we've stayed at as well; we prefer Shibuya for our home base in Tokyo. Both hotels are great, and notably decent prices for a quality hotel in such high-demand locations. The Granbell Shibuya is simply in a perfect location -- just a few minutes' walk from Shibuya station but on a quieter street in Sakuragaocho, so you're both in the heart of the action and slightly insulated from it. Makes it very easy if you're getting off the airport train to haul your bags just a couple of blocks. Just outside the Granbell are a number of cute little izakaya and restaurants, so you don't have to even go over to the busier side of Shibuya to get a good meal. There's a Family Mart and a Lawson's within a block as well, so you are fully covered for convenience. We've stayed in a number of different rooms -- we were delighted on our most recent visit when they gave us a surprise upgrade to the splendid Executive Suite -- and have always been pleased. Like most Tokyo hotel rooms, they are much smaller than comparable hotel rooms in North America, but that's to be expected in Japan. More importantly, the rooms are relaxing and well-appointed, with nice bathrooms and comfortable beds. The service at the hotel has always been outstanding for us, with welcoming and helpful staff. One small downside is they have no on-site laundry, though they do have a laundry service. The pizza restaurant on the main floor is great, though we did have poor service when we went there for dinner -- a rarity in Japan, where you'll generally have outstanding service anywhere you go. Oh well. There's also a nice Japanese breakfast on the second-floor restaurant, with a Western option as well. (Take the Japanese. You didn't go all that way just to eat toast and eggs, did you?) A side note, especially for Western travellers: hotel loyalty rewards programs in Japan are superb compared to their Western counterparts. Make sure to book through the main Granbell site and make yourself an account. Your points accumulate quickly and can be used for nice discounts on future visits. We love this hotel and will be back next time we are in Tokyo.","Winnipeg, Canada","doubleemmartin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Canada</strong>",14,4.0

From Shibuya station make sure you take the West Exit and basically turn left and go up the stairs and straight across and down the stairs. There is a lift pass the stairs to go up for you if you have suitcases. There is also a lift to get down near the hotel but hard to explain without a diagram but keep an eye out on the right. The hotel itself was very nice. Reception can speak english and will keep your luggage if you have arrived early. Travelling solo so the room was adequate with the bathroom basically next to the bed just separated by glass. This hotel has a safe, and provides guests with the necessary toiletries and a bottle of water every day. A little fridge is there too to keep your bottled water cool. Bidet is great as well! Breakfast was included and you could either have a breakfast buffet on the 1st floor or select from 3 types on the 2nd floor. The 1st floor breakfast was your typical scrambled eggs, little sausages, bite size pieces of bagel, fruit juices and cereal. On the 2nd floor you could choose a japanese breakfast (give it a go), a french toast breakfast or a western breakfast of eggs, bacon and toast. Cereal and milk and fuit juices are also available. The layout of the 2nd floor was probably better and I would go the japanese breakfast (but be careful the fish has bones). Great location and nearby Shibuya crossing and with access to the train station you can basically access the other areas of Tokyo. Thumbs up!",,worldwidewords,12,4.0

We like the location of the hotel, it was really close to everything we wanted to do on our last day! We really liked that it was close to the train station, the instructions on where to go from the station to the hotel are spot on, use them! A bar you can access from the hotel with pizzas for 500yen each and drinks starting at 500yen too! The bed was pretty comfortable and the room was small but we opted for the smaller room due to us only staying one night! The layout was cool and efficient enough for us!! Breakfast: You get two options, continental or a pick your meal style breakfast with three options; Japanese Style, or Western (scrambled eggs, toast and meat OR french toast breakfast). We chose option 2 as my boyfriend wanted to try the traditional Japanese breakfast, I wanted to get french toast but it was apparently sold out so i settled for the second western style breakfast and it was gross honestly and not very much food, my boyfriend said his was okay. This kinda sealed the deal on the 3 star review for us! There was ONE waiter and he was overwhelmed handling it all on his own. The self serve juice and coffee station was a mess everything was out and did not even get refilled while we were there.

Basically, it's a very ordinary hotel, very ordinary. We stayed in a poorly designed room, a dark, poorly designed room, with far too much furniture for the space, a very ordinary bathroom, and everything was old and dated, and dark! We weren't worried about the size of the room, as it is Tokyo, so you don't expect too much space, but after reading many reviews we were convinced it was going to be a great choice. Breakfast which was included with the room price, was very simple and for the first few days, sort of moderately appealing, but eventually we skipped breakfast and waited for lunch. The room itself was just plain ugly, with everything brown, or a version of brown timber, except for the bathroom which was a glass box exposed to the bedroom. For privacy there was a curtain which closed the glass box off to the room, but I am still amused and confused who thought the addition of yellow film on the glass was a good idea. Straight out of the 1970's, but fortunately, most of us, and most hotels, have moved on!Location was a big factor in many reviews, but after traipsing up and down the stairs to get to or from the Shibuya station, you'd really need to question the location as a major factor. We were there in January, when Tokyo had a major snowfall, and the snow only highlighted the fact these stairs to the freeway overpass were a huge obstacle. Yes there is a lift (elevator) up, and down, which was ideal when we had luggage, but the freeway was a major downfall whenever we left the hotel, or returned tired at the end of the day including where we dined of an evening.  Thankfully, around the hotel there were some lovely restaurants which were a Godsend as we didn't have to traverse the freeway to eat over the other side!The staff, as they were everywhere we stayed in Japan, were very pleasant and helpful. They were delightful. We had come having spent a week in the Kyoto Granbell which was fantastic, so this Tokyo version was a major disappointment I'm sorry to say.

All amenities are available (including a kettle with coffee and green tea). Bed is very comfortable and evrything very clean. The only point to improve is breakfast: there are 2 options available, à la carte and buffet, and both do not have much choice. We saw the buffet had a choice of cereals, bread, sausages, scrambled eggs and meat balls only, so we opted for the à la carte with a selection of western/japanese/french. My husband had the western that consisted in scrambled eggs, 3 pieces of bacon and some bread, while I had the japanese which was a bit more assorted (fish, miso, fish, egg, tofu). I would give 5 stars for more choice.

The carpets are worn and old. The AC is an old system where they set it for heat so the entire hotel is on heat. Your only choice is how much heat....or you can open the window. Yes a 10th floor room has windows that open (swing out). Hot water for shower or bath was no problem. The price of the room was too high.....about the same as the Shinagawa Prince which was much nicer. Being near Shibuya is nice (about a 5 minute walk to metro station). Many places to eat in this area. Shibuya is very busy...and pretty dirty. I asked for a one hour check out extension and was quoted $30. Better hotels such as the Richmond only charge $10. Breakfast is adequate but nothing special. They have two places to eat breakfast and one offers western food (except of course in Japan the eggs are runny). Staff nice but nothing special. This hotel gives the impression that it is an old Japanese business hotel attempting to be a tourist hotel..but misses the mark. Internet is ok...not slow...but not fast. No view from the rooms.

We kept this window opened the whole time we were here for 5 nights even when we were sleeping. The bathroom was spacious however I wish there was a proper shower curtain or door because water kept pooling up on the tiles if you weren't careful. The bed was nice however the pillows were quite flat and soft. There was another pillow which was harder but it was more like a log so I wasn't sure sleeping on it would do my neck any good. The location is very good! We caught the airport limosine bus which dropped us too at Ceruleun hotel which is only 5 mins walk from the hotel. I suggest you book with the bus if you don't want any fussing around at the train station and getting lost at which exit to go and if you wont be activating your JR pass any time soon to use the narita express. I also did youtube how to get from shibuya station to the hotel if you do plan to catch the train to the hotel. The hotel gives you a free hotel logo towel if you dont need room cleaned for 1 day which was good because personally I dont think the rooms needed to be cleaned daily. I really enjoyed staying here, I would probably stay here again because of the good location and delicious japanese breakfast!

I was able to locate some shopping places nearby through Bebot and got some good souvenirs for my girlfriend. Nevertheless, I got some horse oils for my mother from the drugstore nearby as well. Really thanks for having Bebot in this hotel too. When I got back to my room, I was impressed by the lightings and the bathroom. Room service menu had a variety of homemade pizzas to choose from as well as a range of light snacks and drinks. I slept well on the comfortable bed that night. The next day, I went to have breakfast at 2nd floor. There were 3 types of breakfast to choose from and I picked Japanese style breakfast. Breakfast waiting time was short. When the crew served the breakfast, he explained all the dishes to me in English before I had it. Great service from crew at the restaurant! Finally, Bebot showed the way of getting to Haneda airport from hotel as I needed to go to airport after checking out. Overall, I had a pleasant experience staying at this hotel.

Bathroom was larger than normally found in Tokyo hotels and it was very modern with all up to date amenities. The location was very close to Shibuya station and the main shopping area and it was in a relatively quite area. Apart from the carpets, my only other complaint was there was no coin laundry facilities on site. This I feel a necessity if they wish to cater for tourist who do not want to pay exorbitant prices for their laundry services. They did direct us to a coin laundry facility about 2 km away. The staff were okay however a message that was left for me was never delivered to me which was disappointing.

We wanted an option from a large pricey high rise yet needed one in Shibuya. this hotel is 5 minutes to the station but far enough away that there is no street noise whatsoever. It's a hidden gem in fact. From the station one can roll a suitcase as there are elevators up and down for the pedestrian overpass, no sweat! If arriving from Narita, take the airport limousine bus to the Tokyu Cerulean Hotel and walk 3-4 minutes to the Granbell. Honestly this is the easiest way to do it. The hotel emailed me this suggestion by the way. The included breakfast options are either plated Japanese or Western or a smaller western buffet. The plated option offers very small portions so the buffet is best. The buffet/bar area is a little shoddy and honestly I think that management should work on renovating this area or sprucing it up a bit. Front desk staff are polite and helpful but limited in their English language skills. The level of friendliness is modest by western standards but the staff are well informed and can assist you with almost anything you need. There is a coin laundromat not far away and the hotel will give you a map to it. Laundry service is available but pricey. The in room amenities were outstanding, never seen so much stuff provided. Additionally, bathrobes and slippers are commonplace throughout Japanese hotels. Our room was on a higher floor at the end of the corridor and very quiet. The best thing is the location. Shibuya is a very nice hip happening district and only a metro stop away from Shinjuku and Rappongi two other happening places.

The room was too warm even with the heating switched off, this meant having to keep the window open...which was noisy.Breakfast in the hotel was quite nice.

This hotel is located at the opposite side of all the action happening in Shibuya. You have to cross an overhead bridge to get to the other side where all the shopping and restaurants are. The hotel is also located in the middle of an upslope. You can take the airport limousine or train to the airport but either way, you are not going to have an easy time dragging the luggages to Cerulean Sky Hotel or Shibuya Station. Secondly, the single room that I stayed in was extremely small and the arrangement of the furniture was not fully maximizing space in the room. There was no wardrobe and absolutely no space to use the laundry drying rack even though there was one in the room. I had to move the furnitures around to make space for my luggage and walking space. Power sockets were located at weird places too. There was no air-con until the very last night of my stay. Survived with only the pathetic portable air-con in the room.Lastly, the wifi really annoyed the hell out of me. All my devices got disconnected every few minutes. Tried to speak to the staff about it and their response was that they will try to restart the router. Same thing happened again and again and again. Gave up on using the so-called free wifi after awhile. Wifi is a basic amenity provided by hotels everywhere nowadays, please look into this.If you are thinking of booking the single room, I would suggest you look elsewhere.

While any hotel in shibuya demands a premium price, this hotel is pricing itself in the wrong category. It is a 3 star hotel charging 4 star prices, and has a bit of an amateur vibe about it. Cheap feeling, dimly lit rooms that were decorated using 1980s fixtures, only one power outlet located as far away from the bed as possible, and curtains that don't block out the light. Turning the lights off is a test of logic and patience as they have hidden various light switches all around the place. The hotel is also a bit far from the station as to be a little annoying, and is on the opposite side of where you actually want to be when you visit shibuya. Just stay at the Excel Shibuya hotel. If you must stay here (like I did, because it was the only choice) perhaps ensure you aren't staying in the area they lovingly call ""the annex"", which I believe to be code for ""the old rooms we don't photograph so people don't think we have such rooms when they visit our website"".

There are very handy directions on Granbell's website which directs you using the landmarks.Room: We stayed in the Penthouse Suite, which is a lovely room with a balcony (which I enjoyed sitting out on late at night watching the hubbub of the city). The bathroom is a fantastic space with a large bath and rainfall shower. The bed was really comfortable, the only niggle being you couldn't comfortably sit up due to the handle decoration on the headboard. Plenty of plug sockets to charge what we needed. Large TV too, only Japanese channels shown (although we weren't there to watch the telly so it didn't bother me!). Complimentary bottled water was a nice touch and very handy to take with us when out for the day. Free wifi was reliable and had a strong signal.Breakfast: The two onsite resturants give you two options for breakfast - Saka La Dining which serves a set menu and CONA which offered a continental buffet style breakfast. I preferred the offering at CONA as I enjoyed watching the chef preparing pizza bases for the rest of the day. There wasn't much choice in the buffet, but there was enough to keep you going until lunch time.Other comments: On arrival we were told that because we hadn't replied to the email they had sent that morning, we were in danger of losing our reservation. its a little had to respond to a email when you've been travelling on planes for the past day and a bit! it was a moment of stress that we could have done without. I think this may be a cultural thing as this happened a couple of times during our trip for other bookings we had made - you expect that once you book something, it stays booked, however it would seem that the Japanese like to make sure everything is reconfirmed on the day by a certain time otherwise your booking could be cancelled.

All facilities worked. It was a quiet hotel and beds were comfortable so sleep was not a problem. The decor of the corridors needs to be much brighter than the dark brown with subdued lighting currently employed. There is free Wifi of a good speed.Staff are very helpful. Checking in/out was as painless as it can be and there was no problem when I asked if I could leave a suitcase when I travelled away for two nights. Indeed, the suitcase was already placed within my new room when I returned.I think the weakest part of the stay was the quality of the breakfasts and the need to take a ticket. A greater variety of food would certainly enhance a stay at this hotel.The hotel does, however, give very good value for money and is well located near to Shibuya Railway Station. At first sight, the location of the hotel seemed a bit ""rough"" but it turned out not to be rough at all. There are no views (that I could tell of) but I was not there for the views. I basically wanted a warm/cool place to bed down for the night which was clean and comfortable. This hotel came up trumps in these respects and so I can unreservedly recommend it to any fellow traveller.","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","VinRichley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom</strong>",19,3.0

It picks up from the nearby Cerulean hotel, and would be well worth the extra $ for this transfer service of flying out early or mid afternoon.The Shibuya area is not directly connected via rail and there would be a couple of train changes, making the process a bit tiresome with luggage, not to mention the infamous 'Tokyo Crush' in peak hours.","Melbourne, Australia","71Majj13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",13,4.0

This access has a a wooden door with a glass panel next to it, need to make sure to use the wood side since the glass is static and does not open.The actual main entrance to the hotel is located on the road to the right of the corner that the hotel sits on, just walk up the hill a short distance and you will see the large wooden door, give a good push since it is heavy and you will be right in the main lobby in front of the desk.Check in was quick and simply if you purchased and prepaid online, just hand your passport over, they will make a copy and issue your key. The elevators are fairly quick compared to some.Once you reach your floor, look for the signs indicating which way to go for your room number, the majority of the rooms are located to the right.I stayed in 2 different rooms over 2 nights since my stay was booked separately and had to change rooms which the staff made easy by having the new room cleaned and ready quickly. They also were happy to hold my bags and put them in my new room while I stepped out for lunch.It was nice to have this offered by the staff since other hotels tend to require you to ask if they will do such things.Overall the staff were all great and for those who do not speak Japanese, most all speak fairly good English.As for the rooms, they are typical of most Japanese business hotels in that they are not terribly large but compared to some they are fairly well laid out so that they did not feel overly cramped.One room lacked a closet, but offered a metal rail on the wall for hanging clothes, the other room had a nook (no door) with a hanging rod inside.Both rooms were very clean and offered more modern western like bathrooms that were more spacious that those at APA and other hotels I have stayed at.Both had Windows on the walls with curtains in case you are with someone and need some privacy.The smaller room lacked a tub, but had both a spray wand and a ceiling mounted rain head (that offered very good pressure)I do suggest in using caution when turning on the hot water as it heats up quickly and is scalding hot if you do not set it correctly. I found leaving the handle set at the mid point was a comfortable setting.WiFi for the most part was pretty good and fast, just during the second night it would sporadically lose connectivity repeatedly. Also if you plan to use a VPN to stream shows from foreign locations, don't bother as they have those services blocked like most Japanese hotels.The hotel offers an onsite restaurant and cafe, I only tried the cafe (Cona) which was pretty good and offered individual sized pizzas that were similar to wood fired styles found in the US.Finding the hotel was pretty easy from Shibuya Stations, simply exit and then head for the main square, then turn left if exiting from the Metro sections (Ginza Line) and follow the building towards the back side past the JR ticket terminals in front of the bus stops.Then head for the overhead walkway and go straight across and drop down (you should be right next to the wall of pink/red paper lanterns). Keep straight until you reach the weird 4 way interaction, then go right up the hill and the hotel will be on your left.Lots of great places to eat and drink nearby.","Scottsdale, Arizona","HafuGuy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>",22,4.0

We discovered this the day we were leaving, wish the hotel had mentioned it. Still, the crosswalk mentally separates you from the station and made us reluctant to go back or leave the hotel. Maybe it won't bother u as much. I took the second star off for the breakfast. We tried the set breakfast first, not terrible, but not exactly filling, very little variety. The next morning we tried the other hotel restaurant with the buffet. Big mistake. Awful. Not clean. The eating area is actually a bar in the evening and it looked like they were still mopping up beer. Soggy sausages. Soggy eggs. Stale bread that you have to toast yourself.

We had a double comfort and two single rooms. Our double room was very quiet. All rooms have really great facilities from cotton bedlinen, bathroom accessories plus daily bottles of water when rooms cleaned. Showers excellent. Luxury of warm seated loo as well! Kettle with coffee, tea and powdered creamer. Wardrobe. Safe.We had one medium case in the double room which was accommodated well space wise. Rooms were a little warm as noted in previous reviews however it is very easy to turn off the heating. Reception helpful with one sons room due to heating misbehaving but they came and unlocked the window, turned off the heating which solved the heat problem.....but the open window caused some night street noise. All of our rooms had windows which could be opened. (You mayweed some assistance from reception). Breakfast included and two venue choices - we tried both. The 2nd floor restaurant food good, Japanese or Continental choice arrived on tray, self serve coffee, tea, juice. Much preferred Breakfast in lobby Bar - good coffee, we had self serve small sausages, Japanese sides, scrambled eggs, croissants, toast plus I believe there was also cereal.Hotel WiFi Good.Hotel very well located for eating - many restaurants really close to the hotel to choose from. The Hotel 'bar' with pizza oven excellent - great pizza's for 8Yen each.

From the JR station, you can easily go to all the JR stops (such as Tokyo station for the Shinkansen and the Shinjuku station, to name a few). The Shibuya area itself is good for shopping as there are plenty of malls and global fashion stores. Very close to the Shibuya crossing is the Cat café, incase anyone is interested in going there. Also there are plenty of places to eat in Shibuya and very close to the hotel.- Tidy room and bathroom. Pyjamas are also provided which as very comfy- Excellent customer service: We arrived from NZ at 7:30am at the hotel and the staff were kind enough to store our luggage and also had a room ready by 12pm (usual check-in is 2pm). We were very grateful. Later on we had some problem with the air con and the front desk staff immediately came to our room to sort it out. They are very helpful and efficient.- We chose to have the buffet breakfast which was tasty and had a decent spread (eggs, sausages, juice, salad, croissant, lychee, etc)- Room is small (we stayed in a double room) but very tidy and not too claustrophobic. We had 1 large suitcase and 2 travel bags and it was easy to store them in the room.- Shuttle from the airport drops you at the Cerulean Hotel which is a 5 min walk to Shibuya Granbell. Just walk out from where the bus dropped you and with your back facing the hotel, take a right and walk till the end of that pathway until you see Family mart on your Right. Immediately turn right and keep walking straight, cross the road and when you reach the 2nd crossing, turn right again and the hotel will be on your left.Cons:- The double room is only 20sq m. which is suitable if you are not going to spend too much time in the hotel and only if it is for a day or two. Else get a bigger room.- If you are travelling with friends or with a big family, I would not recommend the double room as the bathroom is just next to the bed and there is lack of privacy.- No views as such from the hotel","Wellington, New Zealand","TravelSwag84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",38,4.0

Breakfast was great - each morning I opted for the Japanese option as when you’re in Japan, do as the Japanese do.The only negative comment I had (which seems apparent across Japan) is excessive temperature setting in the rooms, lobby, and pretty much throughout the hotel. I’m convinced it was set to at least 30 degrees celsius and there were times that I could’ve begun my own hot yoga session in my room!

It is in a quieter area of Shibuya which is a relief after being out and about all day.The breakfast resembles aeroplane food. Seriously, I've had better meals on most airlines. We only went once for breakfast and didn't bother returning as it is inedible. Don't waste your time going for breakfast as there are way better options around. We went to Hoshino Coffee which is close by for breakfast (Just past the guitar shop). They do awesome souffle pancakes for like 750 yen. The staff are pleasant but there is a language barrier and most of the time they could not understand what I was asking. For example: where can we rent bikes and the whole mold situation. But we are in Japan, so it is totally forgiven.

This is the second time I have stayed in Shibuya. I chose the Granbell because of its location and great value rate.It is minutes walk away from Shibuya station, which is a stop on the Narita Express, every half hour. So that's the airport transfer taken care of. There are elevators if you don't want to climb the overpass stairs with your bags.My check-in went smoothly but when I got to my room, which was compact, but with a good size bathroom - Comfort Double - the carpet was badly stained. I am sure it is cleaned every day and you can't expect a full carpet shampoo to be done each time you have slovenly guests but it just spoiled things. It really was grubby looking and that put you off taking your shoes off when in the room. I asked if I could change rooms. The manager came up to take a look and agreed that it was stained. Unfortunately they didn't have any rooms available except smoking rooms. So I asked if he would mind refunding me the money so I could change hotels - I had just paid cash for my stay. While he was prepared to do this, the manager made a few phone calls and then took me up to another room which, while on a smoking floor, only had a few rooms and the room he showed me was at the opposite end from the other rooms and extremely large. There was no cigarette smell and I really appreciated the room change and the professional and helpful way everything was handled, which is something I can say for all the staff who I met. The room was spotless, and was more like a suite. This hotel is in a great location for restaurants, bars, shopping and trains to just about anywhere. If you don't want to take the Narita Express, you are a few minutes walk from the Cerulean Hotel, where you can pick-up the airport limousine bus.The view from the 40th floor bar at the Cerulean is also worth the 5-star cost of a drink. Breakfast was included in my Granbell rate, but I only ate once. You have a choice of two restaurants where you can eat. At the restaurant I chose you have a choice of menu sets - Japanese, eggs and bacon or french toast and bacon. Is it something to rave about? No, but it is not stingy and it will set you up for the day. Plus the staff, again, were really great. Overall, I think this is a really good hotel to consider if you're looking at this area and want good value that doesn't let you down on service.","Melbourne, Australia","alpujarras</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",52,3.0

Likewise, the Japanese breakfast on level 2 and the gentleman that runs the restaurant just lovely. As someone that travels as much as me, these personal aspects far outweigh fanciness. Things aren't always perfect, but the attention to making things right and genuinely welcoming you is what brings me back - and will again.","Bondi, Australia","heresjoanna</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bondi, Australia</strong>",5,4.0

The hotel has lots of info on Tokyo at reception, which was great for us being or first trip to Japan. The room was good... not huge but big enough for the 2 of us & our suitcases (it was worth upgrading to a Comfort Double). Bed was a little firm (not uncommon in Japan), but not terrible. The pillows were actually really comfy. I liked that they provided free bottles of water every day. Complimentary breakfast at the restaurant on 2F was Ok... Japanese, Western or French Toast options. The hotel is in a quiet spot, yet still really close to the main hustle & bustle of Shibuya & the JR station. It was a great hub for us to explore Tokyo!!

I don't regret it for an instant. Granbell Shibuya is 5 minutes from Shibuya JR Station/Metro/bus terminal and the infamous Scramble Crossing, which is an area packed with restaurants, shops, arcades, karaoke bars etc etc - most notably Shibuya Mark City. You can even walk to Harajuku in about 20 minutes if you're so inclined (or it's one stop on the JR line). In spite of this though the hotel is very peaceful and quiet, located on a slightly quieter side road that's mainly used by office workers.The room needs to be paid for in full when you check in. The hotel staff are very helpful and friendly (particularly when I had to call my bank in UK - they let me use their phone at no extra charge) and speak enough English to be able to deal with any questions. There are also leaflets and guides in the lobby area, and a board with instructions on how to get to Tokyo's two major airports. All of the staff are very polite and pleasant.We stayed in a Premier Double room. Although not huge, there was plenty of workable room for 2 people and the bed was huge and extremely comfortable. The bathroom was very modern, with a washbasin area a separate toilet stall and a shower/bath wetroom. The bathroom area is raised on a single step, and can be separated from the rest of the room with a curtain. The bathing wetroom has both a handshower and an amazing, powerful rainfall shower - I loved showering in this hotel! There's also a sofa, tv, safe and a fridge. Room supplies - including shampoo, shaving implements, toothbrushes and paste, shower caps, night shirts and bottled water - are replaced every day. There were a couple of small hairline cracks in the tiles of the bathroom floor, but this was the only negative point that I can think of.You can access all of the Tokyo area easily via subway and overground trains from Shibuya, which is a major and popular station. There is also a FamilyMart on the corner of the road and a 7 Eleven just around the corner (both about 1 minute's walk from the hotel). This is worth noting as many Japanese ATMs will not accept overseas cards - however, the ones in 7 Eleven will always accept foreign cards, so if you need cash (or a late-night snack) you can just pop around the corner. There is also a vending machine on the 8th floor of the hotel.The hotel is very competitively priced for its location and has free WiFi and breakfast (which is fantastic by the way - you get the choice of eating at one of 2 places on site, and I highly recommend La Dining which is significantly better than Cona). Breakfast is between 7am-10.30am at La Dining (Western and Japanese style breakfasts) on the 2nd floor, or 7am-11am at Cona (Continental breakfast) on the ground floor. The tradeoff is that the rooms do not have a view at all; our window looked out onto a wall. To be honest, you won't be spending any time in the hotel; the nightlife in Shibuya lasts all night, so I wouldn't worry about this!All in all, I was extremely happy with this hotel and am planning to visit again. I genuinely do not believe that you will find a better value hotel so close to the centre of the Shibuya area. Very highly recommended.Tips for foreign travellers -1) You can get to the hotel easily from Haneda airport using the Airport Limousine bus (1030 Y one way). Just buy a ticket at the bus counter inside the airport and go down to the stop (they will tell you where to go and speak perfect English). Take the bus to the Cerulean Tower Hotel stop, which is the first stop once you leave the airport area (about 30 minutes). The bus stops in the underground drop off point at Cerulean Tower; walk back out of the underground area, take a right and follow the path as it curves to the right; take the 3rd road on the right, and go up the hill. You will see the huge wooden door of Granbell Shibuya on the left. It can be hard to find first time. You can also catch the bus from the same place to get back to the airport (no reservation needed, just pay the driver). NOTE - the airport limousine bus does not pick up for Haneda in the afternoons on public holidays, so bear this in mind (you can also take the train, but would need to change at Shinagawa).2) Get a Suica/Pasmo card from the ticket office at the JR station as soon as you arrive if you're planning to travel around Tokyo. This costs a 500Y deposit, and can be topped up in 1000Y increments. You can use the card to pay for all subway/overground trains (except Shinkansen/Bullet Train), buses and even vending machines and some shops - keep it topped up using the machines in the station (they all have English language options) and you will save yourself the pain of buying tickets for each journey. Just scan it when you enter or leave any stations. It will tell you the remaining balance after each trip. Most one-way trips cost around 100-200Y in the Tokyo area, except for Odaiba which is more expensive.3) To get to the main Shibuya shopping/eating area, cross the main road using the footpath, walk past the bus terminal and keep going straight. You will reach the scramble crossing (can't miss it!) after about 5 minutes from the hotel door. The Hachiko statue is on the right in the little sitting spot with all of the trees.4) Walk on the left in busy stations (this rule changes in some areas, check and see what everyone else is doing), and adhere to the queues and instructions! Avoid rush hour 7am - 9.30am and 5pm - 7pm - you will be crushed into a carriage. Note that some trains have women-only carriages during rush hour, so check signs before entering the train. Do not take small children or luggage on the train during rush hour - it's not worth the stress and you will not be able to move with them.5) To get to 7 Eleven for the international cash point - go left out of the hotel (up the hill), take the first right and you will find it on the corner with the next road. Most shops take major cards like Visa, but most restaurants are cash only.6) You will be doing a LOT of walking in Tokyo, and it's very rare to find a bench or other opportunity to sit down while walking the city. You will also probably be doing a lot of standing in buses and trains as they are almost always busy in the city centre. Wear the most comfortable shoes you can find.","Camberley, United Kingdom","Jo F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Camberley, United Kingdom</strong>",31,5.0

The only major down side to the room was terrible lighting (so dark- don't bother trying to read anything) and no control over the thermostat as it had not been changed from winter mode! We had to get keys so we could open our window. Breakfast is very average, so don't get too excited (don't go to the cafe breakfast downstairs unless you want cornflakes and a stale croissant).Best thing going for this hotel is its location- about 5 minutes walk from shibuya station and the shibuya crossing.

You can get anywhere is Tokyo from Shibuya station.The hotel itself is quiet - the room is comfy and a good size, hotels in Japan are only small but this one was big by Japanese standards, had a lounge as well as queen bed and then a big bathroom and a HUGE shower. The bed is really comfy, there is heating and AC in the room so it was always cosy. The TV only has Japanese channels but there is a good WIFI connection in the room and throughout the hotel which was fast.We didn't book breakfast with our room but they gave it to us anyway (not sure if this is standard) there are 2 options for breakfast - both are nothing fancy but was good to be provided breakfast. If you decide to pay for it don't expect much - there are cafes close by if you just wanna grab a coffee and a muffin for breakfast instead. the staff were great and helped us book seats at the robot restaurant as well as holding our bags for us after we checked out and didn't fly home until the evening.

It is 5min walk from Shibuya station – so is very convenient for getting around and exploring western Tokyo.We were there on honeymoon – and the hotel manager (who is a really nice chatty/smiley guy) upgraded us to a suite on the 8th floor. The suite is set over two floors – a small lounge area downstairs with TV and coffee machine; and the bedroom and bathroom (includes an onsen-like bath as well as a shower) upstairs. Large and comfortable bed, free in room wifi, and also stereo etc (although made for old-style ipod, so couldn’t connect newer iphones).That said, the room was in need of a little sprucing up (e.g. there was a cigarette burn in the sofa; marks on the wall; a couple of stains on the carpet). And the upstairs level was very warm despite our best efforts to use the aircon (leaving it on at the lowest temperature). The hotel offers either Japanese or continental breakfast – we only tried the latter, which I would not recommend. We came down admittedly at the end of the service, but the options (cold scrambled eggs and sausages; a bit of salad; and a basket of bread) were really not inspiring. I would just suggest the hotel stop offering this actually – especially given there are lots of cafes around the hotel it doesn’t need to offer this. Overall, it was a decent hotel – but with a few changes and a spruce up they could really move this up the market.","London, United Kingdom","caroline j</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",7,3.0

If you're trying to figure out where in Tokyo to stay, Shibuya is always my choice. You can get virtually anywhere from the Shibuya station, so it's a great launching point, and Shibuya has more restaurants, bars, entertainment venues and shopping areas than you could ever explore. The streets are very safe at night; so there is plenty to do nearby, at all hours. The Granbell is over the pedestrian overpass, and then about 2 short blocks, headed away from the noise. So the hotel is extremely quiet. I can't remember ever hearing street noise or noise from the hallway or other rooms. If you're traveling to the hotel from the station with baggage, you will have to go over the pedestrian overpass. Look for the elevator on the corner to get you up to the overpass rather than trying to walk up the stairs or the ramp.The hotel rooms are small, but very reasonably priced. If you're only in the room to sleep, who needs space? You can walk around, even with baggage spread on the floor. The bed is comfortable enough, and the pillows are fine. The bathroom is modern, with a nice rainshower head in the bathtub/shower. One important thing about the rooms are the inadequacy of the lighting. It is not possible to read a book or magazine at night; there are only tiny bed lamps with red shades (which reduce the light) and oddly placed tiny recessed lights in the ceiling. I was able to read on my backlit iPad, but could not read traditional print media or find stuff in my baggage. This really needs to be improved upon. Or you can take a small personal light.There are adequate numbers of electric outlets to charge your stuff, and they are conveniently placed in the desk unit.The backroom products are plentiful and good quality: shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, shavers, toothbrushes, combs, all replenished every day. One black eye for our cleaning team -- they let us completely run out of toilet paper, and we had to trek down to reception to get a roll. That should NEVER happen.Breakfast has two options. On the first floor is minimalist -- corn flakes is about all I saw, but it's in the bar, and smokers are all around you. So we never chose that option. On the second floor is the dining room. The menu options there were the same 3 every day: (1) traditional Japanese breakfast, which we never tried, but it contained some fish, noodles, and some other stuff; (2) scrambled eggs and bacon and salad with 2 tiny chunks of pineapple; or (3) 2 small pieces of french toast, bacon and salad with the same 2 tiny chunks of pineapple. The absence of variety got very old after a couple days. The bacon is virtually uncooked; so we couldn't eat it. The french toast is thick and undercooked. We ate the breakfast for 3 days and then skipped it for the rest of the stay because it was just too hard to choke down. In general, I don't expect a good breakfast when it's an included (free) option, so I take it in stride when it's not good, but for a hotel that otherwise has its act together, I would suggest that if they're going to offer the breakfast, they should make an effort to improve the quality and variety. Overall, it's a great hotel, and I will stay here again and again, but seriously, I will bring a little personal lantern next time and won't waste my calorie budget on the breakfast.",San Diego,"igettheheat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",254,4.0

The corridors were quite dark, too, but not as bad.There are two breakfast options - one buffet-style Western breakfast on the ground floor which we found not so great, and a choice of Japanese or Western breakfast served in a nice setting on the 2nd floor, both of which were very tasty.I highly recommend this hotel, especially if you are looking for something a bit extraordinary for a change.","Vienna, Austria","ISW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vienna, Austria</strong>",130,5.0

I booked a comfort double for my two-night stay at the Granbell. It was a rainy afternoon when I got to the hotel and as I had arrived early, a complimentary umbrella was kindly provided by the hotel staff as I left to get some lunch nearby. I was allowed to leave my luggage (which was wiped dry by the attentive staff!) and on returning, I was told that they have prepared a very nice room for me. I didn't pay much attention to why that was until I stepped into my room. I was upgraded to the luxury suite - with space so large that when I showed the photo of my room to my Japanese friends they didn't believe that I was in Tokyo! The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had a shower and a circular bath tub. Pity I was on a solo trip, as this could've easily been a romantic city getaway for two! Complimentary breakfast was either Japanese (on 2F) or Western at the cafe/bar just next to the hotel. Another plus point is the hotel's location. It was literally 5 minutes walk from the Shibuya Scramble/Hachiko exit of the Shibuya JR eki. Getting up the pedestrian bridge from Shibuya JR with luggage was not a problem as there are lifts (you need to keep an eye out on their location).I would definitely come back again (upgrade or not!) just because of the location.","Sheffield, United Kingdom","Kud0</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sheffield, United Kingdom</strong>",20,5.0

The boutique design was a nice change, albeit with a few quirks. We were amused by the dark, dimly lit elevator and hallways which felt like a night club. Thankfully, our room was more cheerful but definitely showed some wear. We referred to the bathroom as our ""space capsule."" The bathroom was separated from the sleeping area by a clear window with a curtain; you can have as much privacy, or not, as you want. There are two dining options with the breakfast voucher. The 2nd floor restaurant has Japanese and Western sit down meal options and was OK. The Cona Cafe on the street level was also OK and served continental style breakfast but with a good espresso self-serve machine -we ate here 2/3 mornings just to have decent espresso. Otherwise I think they served leftover food from the day before. The Cona Cafe is actually a pizza and wine bar. There's a good selection of small restaurants and cafés near the hotel if you don't feel like walking to the busy Shibuya crossing area. Getting our wheeled luggage from Shibuya Station to the hotel was no problem. Use the elevators up/down from the pedestrian overpass from the south entrance of the station. We asked for directions to the hotel from the information counter at the train station and it was very straightforward. The staff was always friendly and helpful and allowed us to leave our luggage there after checkout while we spent the day in Kamakura before our departure flight from Haneda later that evening.

The room itself was bigger than I expected (still small, but it is Japan) and although it was very Western-style itself, the hotel is surrounded by cute little ramen shops, lanterns and neon lights so you definitely know you're in Tokyo, not in a little Western bubbleThe beds were comfortable (nice and firm. my partner found the pillows too small though), bathroom very clean, wifi was fast and didn't require any extra cabling or routers - just the password given with the room key. Breakfast was included, but wasn't anything special - if you're not keen on OK croissants and below average bacon and eggs, head to the many surrounding places. Our view wasn't anything stunning (central Shibuya in a cheap-ish room) but still afforded neon billboards and a cute rooftop bar with fairylights below us.Very glad we decided to stay in Shibuya. It's an interesting part of Tokyo on its own, and is close to places like Harajuku, Meiji Shrine and Yoyogi Park - about 3km, which we gladly would have walked if it wasn't raining but went for a 4 minute train instead.

It is in a quiet part of the area which is rare and that made it a good hub to explore Tokyo from. This review's poor rating has to do with the condition of the property and the amenities. I am not sure how old this hotel is but it has seen better days and is not maintained to the standard of most properties we stayed at in Japan (or Japan which is quite clean everywhere) . It is in the category of ""design hotel"" and we sprung for a two-level suite. This was a substantial expense and we thought it was worth it to be able to rest after a long flight. Overview: The staff were pleasant and efficient. They helped us with directions and were responsive. That is what saved the stay for me.The property was very dirty, dust bunnies everywhere, duct-tapped vents, art crooked, and whole sections of the common areas were shut off from the public by stacks of furniture and other barriers. The hotel seems to have abandoned the bar and turned it into a storage area. The carpeting throughout is so worn and stained that it looked 25 years old. It was the same with our room. Painted surfaces were chipped, the carpet had many stains and the nap was worn down to the padding in places - the furniture showed a lot of wear for leather and the padding in the sofa frame had lost its resilience - not comfortable. The upstairs patio was filthy and festooned with odd plastic plants, also very grimy and bleak. They offer free breakfast which we thought was a perk but was not worth eating. It consisted of bowls of yogurt, eggs, or toast or pre-made combo plates in a sad upstairs dining area which used to be a restaurant of some kind. We skipped it the last two days and went to a charming coffee shop (chain) next door.All that being said, the shower room was very nice as was the view from the patio.

As I mentioned in my review last year, Tokyo is surprisingly lacking in boutique hotels and this little spot is one of the great ones. It is modern and tidy and located just a five-minute walk from the craziness of Shibuya Crossing but on a quiet side street where you can actually get some sleep.Last year I stayed in one of the tiniest but cleverly functional rooms I’ve ever been in and despite its diminutive size I was happy to re-book this year because the hotel was such a great home base.This year my girlfriend and I, sick with pneumonia, dragged our skis through Shibuya station and the rainy streets, past the out-of-order elevators that normally make the sets of stairs one has to navigate to get across the highway between the stations and the hotel manageable. When we arrived at the hotel with our massive pile of gear in tow we were simultaneously soaked, sweaty, freezing, hot and miserable. Thankfully, the wonderful Mr. Hirohiko Tsukamoto, the sub manager of the hotel, greeted us. After quietly checking us into our room, he informed us that he had a treat for us. Expecting a bottle of water or perhaps some tea, we were surprised when he told us that he had a special room for us that was “a little larger than the regular you booked.” This, it turned out, was the understatement of the trip!Mr. Tsukamoto, taking pity on the two sick and miserable Americans, quietly upgraded us to one of the hotel’s two story penthouse suites. To describe this room in is words is a challenge so please check out my photos.With two-story glass over looking Shibuya, the room is a visual stunner both day and night. The downstairs has a lovely sitting area with a bar and a huge flat screen, and looks out over the city. Gorgeous modern stairs ascend from there across the glass wall and up to the bedroom, which is an oasis in the city. The bed is heavenly and the desk, build of rich, warm hardwood, is set into the wall and faces out over the city. The wood paneling slides over the huge window, lest the light disturb your sleep. There are built in cabinets and drawers everywhere, lights, controls and the like clearly designed to make the suite a “home away from home,” which is exactly what Mr. Tsukamoto told us he wanted it to be for us. Of course, seeing all this comes before you step into the bathroom, which was itself the size of the room we’d booked. There was huge closet, a double vanity and a glass-enclosed WC with the fanciest of the Japanese robo-toilets that quite literally did it all for you. Drawers of toiletries were at your disposal as were piles of lush towels and robes. There was perfect and huge glass enclosed shower with both a rain head and a sprayer wand. And then there was the soaking tub: large enough for two people, L shaped, with one glass wall overlooking both the living room and, beyond the stairs, the city itself through the two story windows, it was an unforgettable experience to lay in the steaming water and recover after a winter’s day touring Tokyo.All in all we cannot say enough positive things about the Granbell, the suite and especially Mr. Tsukamoto. After two weeks skiing in Hokkaido, our days in Tokyo were the perfect end to a wonderful trip! If you need to stay in the Shibuya area and want the personal touch of a small and friendly boutique, this is your place. And if you can afford one of the top floor suites, you will not be disappointed.",park city UT,"expeditiondaddy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>park city UT</strong>",156,5.0

The staff was nice and their English was very good - we live in a part of Japan where hardly anyone speaks English so we really appreciate Tokyo for that.

There are lifts to take you up so you don't have to haul your luggage up the stairs, however note that the lift shuts at 10pm. Staff were friendly when we checked in late at night. There were no big signs to the hotel so you could easily miss it. We found it because a passerby stopped to help us and googled on his phone where the hotel was (look out for a big white square structure at the front). The front entrance/door to the hotel is pretty cool! We went mid March and it was still chilly. The room was well heated, too well in fact that it got hot in the middle of the night. It would be useful if English instructions were provided for the air con. We left the air con off for 2 nights which didn't bother us.The room we had was small but ok for 2 people with medium size suitcases and some carry on. The bed was comfortable and the room was a little dark. We were staying for 5 nights but as we're only sleeping in the room and would be out all day (sometimes until 11-12pm), we didn't need an overly large room. We were on the third floor and looked out onto a street where you could see passerbys. You could not hear any outside noise or trains or traffic.Japanese tv was fun to watch but we wanted to watch some English speaking programs too, especially staying for 5 nights. Breakfast was nice, there is a Japanese and Western menu. We had the Japanese breakfast most days and it was nice: rice, miso soup, packed seaweed, seasoning, mackerel, tofu, preserved radish to name a few. The Japanese menu was the same most days, i.e. mackerel was served each day, so we would have liked a change (when you eat the same breakfast for 5 days, it loses it's appeal). The Western was a bit average (ham and salad with a few other side dishes).Shibuya Granbell is also close to a 7Bank ATM (7Eleven bank) for travellers wanting to withdraw cash out.All in all, we would recommend this for anyone wanting to stay in Shibuya. It is very conveniently located in a quiet street to everything you could possibly want :)","Brisbane, Australia","miaoumiaou81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",9,5.0

However, it is worth noting that if you're hauling luggage from the station, you will need to navigate 2 lots of stairs on the overpass that links the station to the hotel side of the road. As I'd arrived via limousine bus, which drops off at Cerulean this wasn't an issue, as it's literally 2mins around the corner.I'd booked a premiere twin, knowing how small Japanese hotel rooms can be ... and frankly because it wasn't that much more expensive. I'm glad I did, as it was really spacious - plenty of room for 2 people & luggage ... plus lots of hanging space. It's also the only hotel I've stayed at in Japan that had an in-room safe. The bathroom was also very roomy; with separate shower & bath.As to the downsides, which ultimately have lowered my rating [as I just didn't find my stay at all restful]. The bed was really uncomfortable; I didn't have one night of uninterrupted sleep because the mattress discomfort literally woke me up each night.As did the room heating ... even with the in-room air conditioner turned off, there must have still been some filtering in from the stifling common hall. The only way to get some relief was by opening the window for a while, which thankfully Japanese hotels still allow (its pretty much extinct in other countries).Overall - good value & location, but not sure I'd book again as a good nights sleep is pretty important after big days spent walking around Tokyo !","Sydney, Australia","LeoDaVinci</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",19,3.0

Since I was staying for some time, I decided to send a few things down: just a pair of pants and a few shirts and socks. I brought the laundry down to the front desk in the morning, the guy said ok, and they called me up around 8pm that night to pick it all up. No problem. Upon check out, however, they suddenly inform me that I owe ¥5,400 (about $53) for the laundry service, and I was shocked. I'm 100% confident that there was no mention of any price for the laundry service on anything in the check in materials or room, something which the lady at reception did not dispute. Maybe I have strange expectations, but I think that before a merchant can charge you money for something, they should alert you as to what the price is likely to be--or at the very least that there is a price. That way the customer knows he or she is entering into a commercial transaction. This hotel did neither, and that strikes me as sleazy and dishonest, not to mention unfair. If I knew the laundry wasn't free like the coffee or bottled water they give you, I wouldn't have used it. All they had to do was put a few words in the check in materials or the room somewhere that the laundry service costs money, that's all. If I had had a bit more Japanese and wasn't in such a hurry at the time, I would have refused to pay and argued with them about it, since ¥5,400 is a lot of money to me (especially for a small load of laundry!).  But as it was, I paid them and resolved never to go there again.  Who knows what else they might secretly decide costs several thousand yen. ","Aomori, Japan","kmp1776</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aomori, Japan</strong>",1,2.0

(i found shinjuku to be sleezy yet sterile, and other neighborhoods were not as convenient.) the granbell is in the heart of it all, yet without any of the craziness, noise or long walks that you'd have to deal with at most of the other hotels in shibuya. there are countless restaurants and bars within walking distance and it is hard to find a bad meal. the bathrooms were great, the ubiquitous high-tech japanese toilet, lots of toiletries, and a combo bath-shower. overall, very functional use of space. breakfast, which was included in the room rate (and a huge benefit while in tokyo), was offered at two locations. we chose the upstairs restaurant (a la carte) each time, which offered three options, two western and one japanese. both food and coffee were of higher quality than expected and the service was quick. the staff were incredibly helpful and spoke enough english to make communication easy. what's not to love about the shibuya granbell? some travelers will be shocked at the size of the rooms. for a couple who wanted to spend most of our time outside, the comfort double was not a problem at all. but i couldn't imagine bringing a family and staying in those rooms... it would be close to impossible. can't wait to plan a return trip!","Windermere, Florida","amyh12382</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Windermere, Florida</strong>",132,5.0

Due to changes in my schedule, I ended up with an Annex Single Smoking room on the 4th level.As I also stayed in Sakuragaokacho during my previous holiday in Tokyo, finding the hotel was a breeze. The check-in process was seamless and I must compliment the cleaners for making a smoking room feel like an non-smoking one. The front desk staff was professional enough to bring me to the room for my approval before confirming my check-in. Kudos! I am afraid the positive experience ended on the first day.My subsequent nights were a nightmare. The room I stayed in was, unfortunately, situated right above a bar and a rather busy small street. I was appalled that the bar without any consideration that there exists an hotel so closely opposite, blasted rock music at 11pm every night! As though that wasn't enough for the tired traveler - who deserved nothing less than a sound sleep - to deal with, it was even more shocking to hear noisy and drunkard salarymen yelling on top of their lungs after 'happy hour' at the wee hours, also without any consideration for sleeping guests.My deepest disappointment was with the front desk male staff who manned the hotel at night. It during the third night, when I was running a temperature, that I sought the staff to do something about the noise pollution but the literal 'shrug shoulders' response I got was the least I expected of Japanese hospitality. As a result of the disturbance, my sleep quality at Shibuya Granbell was very poor and that affected my holiday significantly. Furthermore, the free Wifi was lagging and one needs to be mindful of intermittent service. Breakfast came in the standard Japanese, American and French options daily with nothing outstanding to comment on.Indeed one will be living in Shibuya - merely 5 minutes to the JR Shibuya Station no less - but with the experience I had, I would rather be staying in a less exclusive area with the luxury of a good's night sleep and helpful staff to make a good holiday.","Singapore, Singapore","SEleven</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",2,2.0

There were also complimentary bottles of water available in the room, which was a nice touch. There are lots of restaurants nearby, with the Shibuya train station a mere 5 minute walk away.

The bathroom was super clean and had everything you could need, which was a plus. Clean bed, clean sheetsHowever, the rugs were stained , which is a peeve of mine and the room service was like non existent but I guess you get what you pay for - if i recall it was like $150 or something a night USD.Breakfast SUCKED and was a little sad. Kinda empty, sad staff, no love. Don't get me wrong, no one was rude just a little bored, sad, jaded, etc etc etc. I am from NYC so I am assuming that hotels in Tokyo are like one sin NYC. If you expect to stay in a nice hotel you in Tokyo, you better be ready to pay for it. Around $350ish USD is what i would assume decent hotel is around here.Location was really great though. Love Shibuya and super close to awesome shopping and almost all the train stations.I wouldn't be against staying here again but I am returning in December but I think i will try another hotel....","Brooklyn, New York","dianelucille</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",6,3.0

I stayed in a Modern Double with my husband, and my Tokyo standards the room was relatively spacious. We stayed in the hotel at the start and end of our trip to Japan, so we were able to experience a few different rooms. The first room we stayed in was on Level 6 and had a great view down onto the street below, and the second room we stayed in was on Level 7 and had an even better view - so definitely ask for a high room with a view across Shibuya. We had to book a room for an extra night at the last minute, and while the hotel was able to accommodate us it was located on Level 5, and the room itself felt very narrow and poky. If it had been the first room I stayed in I would have been incredibly disappointed, especially given that the view was of a brick wall. The bathroom facilities in the Level 5 room were also not ideal - the bathroom itself was beautiful and featured a rain shower and bath, however the curtain which separated the bathroom space from the rest of the room was see through and provided little privacy ... not such a problem when you're staying with your partner, but may be an issue when staying with family. While we had breakfast included with our package, I wouldn't recommend bothering with it (at least with the Western style breakfast), as the selection and quality wasn't fantastic. We only tried it the first morning, and then ended up venturing out into Shibuya every other morning.The staff were generally helpful, and it was great being able to store our luggage after checkout and before our flight.

I checked in really late at night, close to midnight and the process was a breeze. I actually arrived in Tokyo a few days before checking-in, and I left my huge suitcase with them. When I was checking-in, the front desk mentioned that the suitcase was already in my room. It was such a thoughtful gesture.I will admit that the room can do with a bit more work - it looks a little tired and worn down. There was also a funny smell from the toilet but I couldn't work it out what it was. That said, the toilet was very clean and well-maintained. Not much space to put your own toiletries though. Water pressure is great. There was the standard Japanese toilet which keeps the seat warm (don't be alarmed when you sit on it!).The room is tiny but again I was expecting that, so it wasn't a deal-breaker for me. There is a small desk just enough to put your mobile phone and wallet.The bed is comfortable. Room was quiet and the A/C worked well. There is also a dehumidifier but I did not turn it on.I had the Japanese breakfast which was yummy. Grilled mackeral, rice, miso soup, natto. Breakfast of champions (and heart-friendly too).Location - this is where Granbell really shines. It's less than a 2-minute walk to the 24-hours supermart where you can buy snacks and onigiri (rice balls). 5-minute walk to Shibuya station. It is initially a little overwhelming with the overhead pedestrain crossings but you will figure it out very quickly. Plenty of sign posts to mark the way. The front desk is also very helpful; they can provide a map and directions. The hotel is also about a 5 minute walk to Ramen Nagi, a great place for a quick bowl of hot ramen. Plenty of other ramen shops around too.I stayed in a single room. If I'm back in Tokyo for a short stay I will stay here again.

We should have realised this from the lobby which, when we found it, was scruffy, with grubby, grey, sagging sofas and a wooden floor which looked as if it had never been washed or polished. Whilst the location was great, it was no better than the other hotels we had stayed at in the Shibuya area on our two previous visits. Our “Premier Double” was simply awful. The room was on the third floor, looking out on to a tiled wall. To say the room was tired is an understatement: the wall paper was peeling; the veneer was falling off the bedside table and secured with sellotape; it was impossible to get into the far side of the bed without clambering over it (makes you wonder what a ‘small double’ would be like); the glass surface of the main table was so chipped, my husband cut his thumb; the ‘runner’ over the bed was stained; the toilet was dirty and the sink became completely blocked. The room would not be suitable for anyone one with a disability since it had a high step up to the bathroom and toilet area. The disappointment with the room was matched by the equally appalling breakfast: cold scrambled eggs, if you were lucky, some squash masquerading as fruit juice, lukewarm tea and coffee and a few soggy salads. We did not try the Japanese breakfast. In fairness, staff were helpful when we complained and our complaints were dealt with promptly, but their English was not as good as I had encountered elsewhere. The bed was very comfortable and bathroom itself, lovely. However, none of this alleviated our feeling that we were paying over the odds for an overhyped hotel which provided accommodation and food of a very poor quality compared to other hotels in the area.

And we were very happy with our choice. The location is excellent. Its very close to the Shibuya metro and train station thus making it very easy to travel around Tokyo as well as to and from Narita Airport. Its also at the quiet end of Shibuya, which means that all the sights and shopping in Shibuya are within convenient walking distance but yet the hotel is in a very quiet area. We slept with our window open for most of the week (would never work in eg. NYC) and we were never woken once due to street noise. Our room was a modern double. And as with most hotel rooms in Tokyo, the room wasn't huge but big enough for two people and very clean. The only downside to the hotel (as with many other Japanese hotels) was the western style breakfast which wasn't fantastic and quite small in its portions. But on the other hand, there is a french bakery and a Starbucks on the 4th floor in Mark One Plaza across the street from the Shibuya station in case one would like a more hearty breakfast. And considering the price we paid for our room, we are in no position to take down the overall grade due to the breakfast (wich was edible but not fantastic).

And avoid the dubious buffet breakfast in the bar out front: go straight to the restaurant on the 2nd floor which is partly buffet & partly menu service: at least it looks clean and the food isn't sitting out all morning. The Japanese breakfast is healthy and tasty and the french toast isn't too bad. Overall, the food's not great (but at least it saves you some cash in a pricey city.) However the rooms seem well sound-insulated, great for sleeping, and although you have to negociate several flights of stairs of pedestrian overpass to get to and from Chibuya station (so pack light!) it's really close and Chibuya is handy to great eating areas like Naka-Meguro, Ebisu, Shinjuku, Roppongi (by bus) as well as destinations West of central Tokyo (Chuo line, mount Fuji etc.).","Montreal, Canada","567kimf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",55,3.0

It is well located just a quick walk from the shibuya station and this is very nice as you'll likely be dragging luggage (i had skis too) which is no mean feat in one of the busiest pedestrians areas in the world. make sure you study the hotels map on its website for the walking directions. If followed to a T the will get you there in about 5 minutes. However, there are numerous ways to blow it and its a hilly area so when in doubt, consult the map.The hotel itself is nicely designed. Very modern and very functional. My room, as you can see, was in total (including the bathroom) approximately 10' x 6'. This meant there was practically no room to walk around; however, it was totally comfortable, bright (as it had two huge opening windows) and very functional. The bathroom was a glass enclosed unit with a fancy Japanese toilet and an awesome scaldingly hot rain bath type shower, which was much appreciated given the freezing cold tokyo winter. The location is great: it's just far enough from shibuya crossing so as to be quiet but close enough to walk there in five minutes. This also means its only a fifteen minute walk from harajuku and ayoma, putting you right in the middle of some of tokyos coolest neighborhoods. If you're here in part at least to shop you really can't be better situated than here as every major label and department store in the city has a branch no further than 20 minutes walk away. In Tokyo this means that every brand you've ever heard of and thousands you haven't are at your doorstep, without the need to get on the train. A big plus in this mega city. Being close to shibuya station also means you can pick up the JR Narita express right there, which is the best way to get back to the airport from the city unless a $300 taxi ride is in your budget. On the downside the hotel shows its age almost everywhere. A new coat of paint on the interior walls of the lobby and the rooms would do wonders to cover up all the scuff marks that come with wear and tear. Some linens were torn and the bar downstairs looks like it was once hip but has since been taken over by football fans who've tacked beer posters everywhere. The restaurant definitely leaves something to be desired so don't go thinking the free breakfast is a selling point as its nothing at all. However, it really doesn't matter given that there are a million options nearby where you can have anything from the best French pastries east of Paris to donuts from New York's Donut Plant (at the only outlet of that Mecca for fried dough outside of the lower east side I know of in the world). In summary I'd stay here again in a minute. With its convenience and comfort and the fact that you can actually get a nice and very stylish room with your own bathroom in the middle of Tokyo for about $100 (try finding that in New York or London) you can't beat the shibuya grandbell.",park city UT,"expeditiondaddy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>park city UT</strong>",156,5.0

Hence, our expectation of their service had been topped since. On the day of for us to check in, I personally asked them whether it was okay for them to give us a lift for our many huge luggages. Frankly, despite us being a bunch of ladies, my friends and i were considered quite independent in terms of minding our own stuffs especially when we were in overseas. We will not trouble others if we were capable of doing ourselves. In that case, we had just came back from a whole day of walking around and each of us lugging at least 3KG of baggage. Hence, their little help will really make our day. Mind you, we were not mind of tipping if they kindly send our luggage to our rooms (FYI, there was luggage trolley in the lobby).We were so shocked when they refused to help us. It wasn't they did not understand what we were requesting because I had explained in understandable universal gestures and known English. Their English level was clearly good given the fact they fully understood my other questions especially on paid services (eg. International calls).I mean, wasn't hospitality all about providing your customers' needs and requests? We were even surprised with the fact that they were awarded the Best Hotel by Tripadvisor. In fact, the main reason my friends and I decided to book this hotel was because if that reason. Clearly, we had been disappointed when we had not even stepped into our rooms yet. Generally, the rooms were considered fine given the price we paid. But the cleanliness was unacceptable. Spider cobwebs and dust were concealed. Well, obviously they weren't well hidden. The bathrooms were truthfully barely covered. I couldn't justify the reason behind their ""creativity"" of exposing the bathrooms. I believe this hotel wasn't labeled as ""love"" hotels by the reviewer, was it?Location wise, I would say it is centrally situated in Shibuya. Tokio Mall was merely opposite the road. Nearest subway was also a few minutes walk. I must say, be prepared for a sloppy hike.

It is only a five minute walk from Shibuya station (south exit, west gate) I got the directions from the hotel web site and it was easy to find, tucked away behind a big wooden door in a quiet area. We were early so left our bags and went out for the day. When we arrived back our bags had been taken to our room and we were also upgraded from a deluxe king to a cosy suite. It is quite a quirky hotel. We opened the door to our room to a spiral staircase that you walked up to get to the room. It was very nice. A small lounge and coffee table with a flat screen TV, a nespresso pod coffee machine, fridge, free wifi accessable from the room, a large king size bed, a big bath on a level above the bed(separated by a sliding screen),good storage space for bags and clothes and the best toilet that was so automatic it washed and dried! The toiletries were amazing. Everything was fresh and clean.The towels were changed and bed made every day. Breakfast was included and we only went to thr restaurant on the 2nd floor. Tried the different types breakfasts and found the french one to be the best for us. There were tourist pamphlets in the lobby but got most of our information from the tourist office at the station. Hotel is close to Shibuya Crossing, many restaurants and shops.

I might have felt differently if the weather was poor and had to stay inside, but that was not the case. The small hotel has two entrances and is easy to find, a few minutes walk from the Shibuya police station and a very large luxury hotel - The Cerulean Tower - which is handy because the express bus to and from Narita stops there. The room included breakfast which was more like brunch food. The in-house restaurant makes excellent pizza. There are tons of great restaurants in the area and Shibuya itself is a great place to hang for a few days - lots of really interesting shops and great people watching. Close to the subway and parks, and an easy walk to other neighbourhoods. The staff were very good, and helpful with directions. There's an excellent self-laundry about a five-minute walk from the hotel that's easy to use...just bring change. My only complaint is that the free wi-fi was limited to the lobby.

I have no idea how this hotel gets the ratings it does. We checked in to a deluxe room and were shocked at how dirty it was. The linen/towels were fine but everything else was filthy. The bathroom was full of hairs, mold, small pieces of rubbish. The main living area had a moldy ceiling, marks all over the walls, dust/grime on all surfaces, moldy coffee machine, junk in wardrobe. We complained and they moved us to a suite with the spiral stair case. Its obviously fabulous in terms of design, but was equally dirty and so run down. There was what looked like coke sprays on the columns, mold on all the curtains, disgusting bathroom. Hotel lift was the same - filthy carpet, greasy marks, hairs stuck in joinery!? So even though it was a huge upgrade we just couldn't tolerate it and left. The girls at the desk were very helpful and happily refunded our prepayment - so the service in that sense was good. This hotel was totally at odds with our normal experience of Japan where everything is so clean and well looked after, even the smallest and cheapest hotels.

But when we explained it over the phone, the staff very politely said that they will not take money from us for the 1st night, which was so nice (irrespective of their policy where they can charge some amount for short notice cancellation) We were extremely happy & surprised to see how good they were where as in most of the other countries it's only about making money.

This place is a 2-minute walk from Shibuya station, which is one of the major train/subway stations in Tokyo and therefore makes it convenient to get almost anywhere in the city. Shibuya is also one of the centers of youth culture in the city, so it's more vibrant and fun (though also therefore more crowded and a tad grimier, which I actually kind of liked) than other neighborhoods.- Room design: Our ""Modern double"" room was small but comfy and ingeniously laid out, as many Japanese hotel rooms are. Special props for the bathroom, which is glassed in on two sides so you can peer into it from the bedroom portion of the room (curtains provided for privacy). It creates a sense of a larger space -- not claustrophobic at all. It was totally clean.- Price: though it was among the more expensive hotels in our two week trip through Japan, it's a good value for this area.Now, the downsides.- Firstly, and this is not something I'd typically say of many small foreign hotels, they really need to have staff who speak better English. Why? Because this hotel now has a Tripadvisor award, and they are *clearly* trying to cater to and solicit foreign business -- the majority of guests we saw in the hotel were *not* Japanese. The staff is ever-friendly and polite, as were almost all folks we met in Japan, but they didn't quite have the language skills to really provide good concierge service (booking restaurants, providing directions, etc) or to explain many intricacies of the hotel. Speaking of which:- There is no service elevator in this tallish hotel. That means for several hours during the middle of the day, when the staff clean the rooms, the two elevators were constantly in use by staff. This meant to get up to -- and down from -- our room in the afternoon, we often ended up stopping at every floor so service people could get on and off the elevator to do their work. What should have been quick stops to grab something from our room became frequent fifteen-minute wastes of time. Why didn't we just use the stairs? Because...- The stairway doors are locked. Maybe there's a way for guests to open them, but I certainly couldn't figure it out. Maybe they open automatically in case of emergency, but in addition to being an annoyance I did worry about safety in the event of fire or something.- The bedroom windows can only be opened and closed by staff with a special key. This isn't atypical of hotels, and usually it's not a problem because there's climate control in the room to adjust for heat or cold. EXCEPT...- We stayed during the week when the month changed from October to November. And it turns out that starting November 1st, the hotel turns on the heat, and doesn't allow you to use the controls in the room to cool things down. So we were stuck in a warmish room, unable to turn on the AC, or to open the window without calling a service person to do it for us. Majorly annoying, especially after two people take showers and the room gets so humid the window actually fogs up.I'm a little sad to point out these flaws, because again, the staff was super friendly, the room was neat and we enjoyed our stay in the area. But I feel like the Granbell now has an international rep and they could do a bit more to live up to it.","Los Angeles, California","triceratops111</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",35,3.0

Overall, I recommend this place to everyone who would like to stay in this area. I give this hotel a 5 star rating because I had great and efficient email communications with them before my arrival and it was everything as advertized. Also, I thought I would have to pay big bucks to stay in Tokyo and I was really not the case ( paid 120$ all taxes included for a single.

Location couldn't be any better for access to the train station, Shibuya Crossing (the busiest intersection in the world, it's quite an experience), shopping, a huge park and the Harajuku shopping district. It's a 3-5 min walk to the Hachiko entrance (yes, just like the dog from the Richard Gere movie, the statue of the dog is there), which is also where the Shibuya Crossing is located - if you're unsure, just wait for a light change and watch the masses, and I do mean MASSES, cross in every direction (there is a Starbucks that over looks the location from one story above. Buy a coffee and have a seat at the windows). The hotel staff are exceptional, incredibly friendly and helpful (even planning trips, recommendations, etc.). The room cleaning was always amazing and I don't thinkin ever saw the cleaning staff (ALWAYS see the in the hotels in the states, no matter what time you arrive/depart), but the room look exceptionally clean and organized no matter how much we messed it up from the previous day. The bed was very comfortable, fairly firm but not too much. I never heard any street noise, either. The ""robotic"" toilet is quite the experience: heated seat (and you can adjust the heat), several bidet options - normally I would explain that, but I'm just going to let you figure that one out on your own - keeps it exciting for you, haha. It'll be one of those, ""Hey sweetheart, check this out..."" moments. Think we had a Premier Double room which was more than big enough, but keep in mind this is Tokyo, nothing is really ""big""...except the prices :-)I would whole-heartedly recommend this hotel.Only con's would be no wifi in the room, have to go to lobby for that. I remedied the wifi issue for the entire trip by renting a mobile wifi device from www.globaladvancedcomm.com which I both my wife and I can connect our iPads at the same time. Speed was pretty and convenience even better. Cost is about 930 Yen a day, which is approx $12 USD, based on 80:1 Yen:USD conversion at the time of this writing. You can arrange to have it delivered to the airport or hotel for your pick-up. They request 2 day advance notice to get it to your location, but I did mine last minute and they delivered to my hotel room the next day by 11am, outstanding! They even include a pre-paid envelope to return the device when done.","Reston, Virginia","girau-travl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Reston, Virginia</strong>",63,5.0

The room was absolutely silent - no outside noise or noise from other rooms.It's not the easiest place to find from the station, though the map on the hotel website is good - if you come out of the south west entrance of Shibuya station or get dropped off by bus, you have to use the elevated footbridges to cross the intersection. Look for the ""Key"" guitar shop or a large bookshop - those are on the right direction and the hotel is one block farther along. You can see the hotel name in neon lights high up on the building.The rooms are small but very cleverly designed and I didn't feel cramped even with two suitcases (3 week stay, including a conference!). The bathroom is also well-designed and completely fine (not cramped). The included breakfast was a nice touch and they did have some western options, at least in one of the two restaurants.

The hotel is conveniently located from Shibuya station, which has easy access to the Narita express train to Narita airport. It was a little difficult to find the first time. The easiest way to get to the hotel from Shibuya station is to exit from the West Gate and take the pedestrian overpass (there is an elevator for people with luggage) directly over the big street, until you see a family mart on the corner (at street level). Take the stairs/elevator down to street level. When you're facing Family Mart take the street on the left for a block, and make the first left. The hotel will be directly ahead. It is important to note that the hotel charges per person per room. There were 3 people in our group and we booked a double and a single. Found out the hard way - we had to pay extra for the second person, even though we had book a double room.The single room that I stayed in was just enough space for one person, but it was clean and well maintained. There was a twin bed, a small desk, and a mini fridge with complimentary bottle of water a day. There was no closet in the room, so I lived out of my luggage during my stay. The bathroom is only separated by a glass door, so there is no privacy. Not a big deal since the room was for one person anyway. It was difficult to control the room temperature because it was in Japanese. I was never sure which was the AC, fan, or heater. The hotel has wifi in the lobby. The hotel provided breakfast tickets to one of 2 restaurants. The restaurant at the 2nd (or was it 3rd) floor of the hotel was great. You pick what style (western, japanese, french toast, etc) that you want, and they bring you a tray. I tried the western and japanese styles, and they were delicious. The other breakfast option, however, is sorely lacking. Cona restaurant, located next to the elevators in the lobby, was HORRIBLE. They only had eggs, sausage and some bread, and everything was left out on the counter so everything was cold. Complained to the front desk and they basically said, 'sorry, nothing we can do.'

I stayed for 10 days and was really glad I chose this place over some boring, beige, business hotel.The location was beyond perfect - really close to the madness of Shibuya as well as the train but tucked away and quiet. I also found the staff to be super helpful and nice. They spoke some English and were incredibly accommodating when I asked if I could be moved to a corner room which they did for me no problemo. The restaurant was kinda eh but you're in Tokyo so who cares, there are countless places to choose from.If you speak English and want to hang out with other English speaking types, walk over to the Pink Cow for music and great food.

Reception staff were not overly friendly, but efficient. A boutique hotel, it has a cosy feel. Rooms are neat and clean and make smart use of space. The Modern Double rooms are a reasonable size but you wouldn't want them to be any smaller for two people plus luggage. Mood lighting is a theme of the hotel - even with all lights on in the room, lighting is soft and warm. It would be good to have a bright light in the room that can be switched on or off as required. Lifts and corridors are dark with their own mood lighting.Breakfast consists of a choice of western or Japanese style. We had the western breakfast each day and it's really not that great. The idea is good - having bowls of the usual bacon, scrambled eggs, salad, tuna, fruit etc out on a table, but the hot food is not kept hot. It sits there for however long it takes to be eaten and replenished. Most of the time it was cold - bacon, eggs and bread. However, when we asked for some hot, freshly cooked eggs the staff member on hand was very obliging. Not sure how they would manage in summer. I think they should invest in some bain marees. Other than that, it's a nice cosy hotel, with plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby.The Airport Limousine Bus service is a good way to get to either airport and you can catch it just around the corner at Cerulean Tower (bus is on B1 level). Btw the bar at the top of Cerulean Tower is excellent for a cocktail - ask to sit against the window for spectacular views.We've stayed at Shinjuku pretty much every other time we've visited Tokyo and Shibuya was a great alternative. It's more contained/less spread out than Shinjuku and while there are a lot of people walking the streets, it doesn't as manic.

Breakfast can be in two places (cafe or pizzeria) and I recommend the pizzeria. The buffet is not very extensive, but the a la carte food in the cafe is just poor and very small. The rooms are quiet and offer aircon. Just to clarify what might appear like it in other reviews: you do not have wifi in the rooms. There is a Ethernet plug and free wifi in the lobby and in the bar. The front desk staff we had to do with did not speak English very well. Some do speak English, but rather basic.

Western breakfast in the cafe downstairs was quite pitiful and I was so grateful for the second choice option of dining upstairs in the Japanese restaurant with a full Japanese style breakfast each morning while quietly planning out my plans for the day. The front desk was not super helpful for tips on eateries and probably for westerners who like the neighborhood it's just as well to simply step into the neighboring alleys and grab anything from Italian to Tapas to ramen.

I stay here several times a year and normally book into a Modern Double. Yeah, it's small by US standards but the level of comfort is great and it's in Tokyo - things here are small.When I checked in this time round, I heard the pleasing words of 'as a thank you for staying here regularly, we're upgrading you to a suite room tonight - we hope you enjoy it'. Firstly - it's always nice to be appreciated and remembered when you travel, it goes a long way. Major, major brownie points to The Granbell for that. That's real boutique service.Secondly, the room was incredible. I was in the Urban Suite. This is one of the coolest hotel rooms I've stayed in, bar none. The door from the corridor looked like any room, but on entering you're in a lobby area (with cool art and lighting) where a spiral staircase leads upstairs to a glass-walled landing and your actual room. Now, it's a challenge to get your case up those stairs, but it's worth it. The room was immaculately decorated - still not massive by a US suite comparison - but big for Tokyo and ultra-stylish. Exquisite polished wood surfaces, exposed slate-brick walls, a separate washroom, standalone shower and a freestanding bath overlooking the room and the view. Very, very nice. The Nespresso maker was a very welcome touch (although no sugar, pfft) and my only real complaint was that I was only there for one night.I love The Granbell - it's everything a cool boutique hotel should be. The Modern Double rooms are fantastic - small, but stylish, comfortable and reasonable. The Suite, though, was something else. Park Hyatt or Granbell Suite?

Obviously this depends on what you're visiting Tokyo for, but it is the shortest walk to JR Shibuya station / Shibuya crossing, 1 stop from Harajuku, 2 stops from Shinjuku, and on the same subway line to visit Ueno park and other cool stuff. All hail the Yamanote line! For our trip, all the shopping, bars and general stuff we wanted to do was in very easy reach from this location.We stayed in the comfort double room and my gosh it is tiny. We stayed for 12 nights, so I think if you're staying for that long (or longer) then its probably better to pay a bit more for a slightly bigger room. Especially if you're like me and empty your suitcase onto the floor and then sift through mounds of clothes every day complaining you can't find anything. But if you're super neat and have a small suitcase then maybe it won't be so bad.They give you these cute little breakfast vouchers and each morning you can pick whether you go to the western style cafe, or the japanese cafe. The japanese breakfast is something you should definitely try! You can keep refilling your drinks for free there. At the western cafe you only get one drink. Something to keep in mind. Also the waffles at the western cafe were really good.Also! You must try the noodle place right next (left) to the hotel. You go in and pick a bunch of ingredients, put them in a basket, hand them to the dude behind the counter and they put them all in delicious noodle soup for you!The staff were pretty friendly, they have recommendations for good sushi restaurants and onsen around Tokyo, however their recommendations are based on a file they have, and if you ask for something that's not in their file, they don't really know what to do and just try to keep recommending what they already have.HOWEVER, the big up on this place was that we had booked our room at a particular price, and a few weeks later noticed that the price on their website had gone down (they'd added a special for our room) and we emailed them asking if there was any chance if we could get the special price and they adjusted our booking no hassles and we ended up saving some money. SUPER GOOD OF THEM. So keep an eye out for different specials on their website.Also! It was Halloween when we were in Tokyo, and they had a trick or treat basket at reception filled with lots of treats, and they were legit treats too, like full packets of M&Ms and whole snickers bars. Incredible.So overall I think this is an amazing place to stay. You can get ice from an ice machine on one of the floors so your drinks will always be super chill. But the pillows were a bit uncomfortable. Actually, make that REALLY uncomfortable. And they refill your little shampoos and soaps every day so you can bring heaps of them home as souvenirs for friends etc.","Melbourne, Australia","sinhead</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",8,4.0

The first thing to say about this hotel is that it isn’t very easy to find, especially for first time visitors to Japan (like us). It is recommended you print out a map before leaving and even taxi drivers are not sure where it is (although four sets of locals who met us there all found it with no problem). If you are coming from Shibuya station head for the West exit then use the walkway to cross the road. When you reach the hotel it may look closed, but it isn’t, just push the big wooden rotating door! For our first night we were upgraded to a Premier Double, which we thought was a nice touch (especially as we checked in an hour or so early – no complaints from the staff). The Premier Double is quite a long room but the one we were given had no view at all. It does have a separate toilet and one of the best showers we have ever experienced.When we returned from Osaka for our second two nights we were given the Modern Double that we had booked. As it turned out we preferred this room, even though it is slightly smaller. There is no separate toilet and the shower is not quite as good as the Premier Double because you do not have a much space, but you do have a view and a larger television (which his only any use if you are Japanese – apparently Japanese hotels don’t seem to cater for overseas guests when it comes to television). The bed is the same size and even though some may consider the room small, it has absolutely everything you would need.The hotel has free internet connection and breakfast is included in the price – we would recommend picking the café over the restaurant, but if you are used to a large breakfast neither option is going to satisfy you. The staff were friendly and the hotel was clean.All Japanese hotels are expensive, but this was at the more reasonable end of the scale (roughly £165 a night for the Modern Double at current exchange rates) and we were happy to stay there and would stay again.","Stroud, United Kingdom","MrHandBaggageOnly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stroud, United Kingdom</strong>",145,4.0

Despite some of the reviews saying that size of room was small and cramped, I had no issues with the room I stayed in. I got a Premier Double room which is bigger in size to the other room types offered, such as the Comfort Double (which I understand is the basic room) and then the Modern Double (slightly more room). The Premier Double was spacious, clean and modern and it wasn’t that much more to pay than the other room types. For two people, it was more than enough room. Worth paying that little bit extra! Breakfast was included too. The electronic toilet was cool and the bathroom (with bathtub) was nice and clean – had a great shower! The location is central and it is located in a nice quiet area, slightly on a hill. It is about 4 minutes walk from and to the Shibuya Station and a few more minutes walk to the shopping malls/building and to one of the main sites – Shibuya Crossing, photos attached. There was a great wine bar just down the road / around the corner from Granbell that had a great atmosphere (literally packed out with a mix of people – locals, tourists and ex-pats) and people were queuing outside. There is also a local / traditional wine bar right next door to the Granbell that only sold Japanese wines/alcohol but we didn’t end up going in – would have been interesting though! Restaurants and food outlets are also nearby. In terms of the hotel décor, I would agree with some of the reviews about it being too dark. The colours (or lack thereof) consist of mainly black and dark chocolate colours with some lines of red filtered through the elevators and corridors/hallway to the rooms. I read somewhere (maybe on the Japan Lonely Planet Guide) that the Granbell was also known as a “dayroom” hotel. I think that explains the reason for the colour scheme – you can hardly identify the person standing next to you in the elevator or in the hallway! It allows you to be discrete I guess. Hotel staff spoke English, service was friendly enough, it was a no fuss check in and out for us. Thumbs up for this boutique hotel.","Darwin, Australia","SQC80</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Darwin, Australia</strong>",13,4.0

This hotel - although quite small - is very convenient to Shibuya Station (a short 5 minute walk) - even the Narita Express goes from this station - and a bit further walk from the central shopping district.We had a double room and we splurged on 3 single rooms for the adult daughters, and although they were all small - we loved them. The bathrooms were the best we had had in Japan.The staff on the desk were very helpful, even when we had to arrive in Tokyo a day early they did their best to accommodate us with minimum inconvenience to us.The only odd thing was that breakfast was included (which was a surprise and was great!) but the small cafe where it was served had a very odd menu (hotdogs or pancakes/ waffles and ice cream) and unfortunately allowed smoking (as it was so small there was no escaping the fumes while we were eating).Overall - I would be very happy to stay at this hotel again on my next trip to Tokyo.","Canberra, Australia","kazm0</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",36,5.0

They like their garish colours of lime and yellows mixed with black. The bathroom was brilliant. I think I stayed too long under the shower as I was mesmerised by the gadgets! Me and my partner stayed in a double bedroom and although it was quite cramped you soon get use to the surrounding. The sight from our window was not very nice. Just the other block in front of us but hey, who cares. You're in Tokyo. We hardly stayed in our room. There's so much to see and do in Tokyo such as visiting the local parks, museums, temples and of course shopping! Even if you have no intentions of buying anything you have to check out the department stores especially one called Shibuya 109. This is 9 floors jam packed full of independent shops for girls!!! Brilliant. Don't worry, there's plenty for guys as well.The cool thing about the hotel is that you’re so close to their metro/tube station that's it's easy to get around although navigating around Tokyo was challenging as there's no road names! The restaurant downstairs was fine. Although I do remember the portion sizes being tiny so we had to keep asking for more. For example we ordered some fries and it came in the most tiny paper cone - more for a child. Don’t' worry we did indulge in Japanese food my favourite being King Crab which rice and sushi served at the restaurant where the film Kill Bill restaurant/fight scene was based on.The staff at GranBell were very tentative. Yes their English is not very good but you get by. It's best to ask the guys at the desk for directions before you set off on your explorations.I would def recommend the hotel to my family and friends for sure.

The N’EX goes directly from the airport to Shibuya station, which was particularly helpful.The hotel is small and stylish and the rooms were clean and very comfortable. It is more boutique hotel than business hotel, which provides its charm. We had the ‘premier’ double, so it no doubt had a lot more room than others. The bed was excellent and the show was very good (rain shower).The complimentary breakfast was tasty – both the Japanese and the Western options were a good start to the day. Free wireless was also a plus.The staff here were very friendly and helpful and the restaurants and bars near by are worth checking out.The only down side was that the room we were in had no view at all – the window looked out to air-conditioning vents.

You are a 5 minute walk from the Shibuya station, but you are on the other side of the main road/highway away from all the madness. It's a bit hard to find for newcomers to Japan (i.e. no street signs at ALL in Tokyo so you need to be very handy with a map!), but it's not too hard to remember after the first time. The other good thing was the included breakfast. You have options as far as places to eat and what type of dishes you can have. We usually opted for the ""western"" breakfast options at the cafe. They had a different take on standards (see picture), but usually pretty good. Also, there is free internet in the lobby, but it is only 1 computer and you sometimes have to fight for it.On the down side, our room was VERY small. We definitely had opted for the cheapest double room and they put the size in square meters on their website, but you don't really appreciate it until you are there. The room was literally 7-8' wide. There was the bathroom on the left when you walked in with a shower, sink, and toilet. Then the queen size bed against the wall and along the window (there was no room at the foot of the bed). The TV sat on a desk across the walkway from the bed, but there was NO space to put our luggage that wasn't in the way. The chair in the room was also worn and dirty, which was a put-off. But they usually cleaned the rest of the room well, so it wasn't too bad. Also, the english abilities of the staff we encountered wasn't all that great. But they were very nice! For almost $600 for 3 nights, I felt that we could have found a better deal with a bit more space.","Saint Louis, Missouri","wlfmn77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",47,3.0

The rates at this property are extraordinarily reasonable and the property is one of the only examples I have ever seen of a high quality Japanese boutique property (Claska is another):Best things about the GranBell:- great value (low room rate, inclusive of breakfast and internet)- convenient location in Shibuya- large rooms for the price point (at least if you choose a double room)- stylish and efficiently decorated rooms- rain shower The biggest potential issue at this property is that it does double as a love hotel. This isn't really obvious to foreigners but Japanese guests would be able tell. I chose the property becuase of it's high rating on Tablet Hotels and it's excellent price point. Due to the dual role of the property, I'd be very hesitant to stay here if I needed to conduct business at the hotel itself. My double room was better than what I have experienced at the Cerulean Tower next door. The beds are long enough to accommodate foreigners and the property has avoided the injection molded bathrooms that are common in Japanese business hotels.This is a three star property so be aware that service levels are lower than a larger property (i.e., no bell boys) and the property lacks a business center and gym.

Even forgiving the unusually low rate of English among the staff, you can't expect much hospitality or interest.The design effort is bizarrely varied throughout the hotel. From the front door you'd think you were entering a boutique hotel (though I believe there are over 200 rooms, so the only thing boutique about it is the number of staff). The lobby is cramped, but looks nice (though on the second day, there were boxes strewn about). The rooms are seriously cramped and look like someone threw a couple of designer goodies into the mix at the last minute, and then there's a cafe/restaurant that looks like it belongs on Khao San Road.

We wonder if they have a kitchen... They didn't even have some milk... incredible. - Common areas need painting, carpet replacement,... not very well kept.- A bit more cleaning.- Lack of a sitting area. They do have a bar, but not from the hotel.- Breakfast room is not as designed as the rest of the hotel, no taste at all.TIPS:- For a bit more money, ask for the Superior Twin room, is worth the extra money you pay.High celings having a deep sensation of space, located at the topfloor by the suites. There is just one Premier twin. Look at the pictures I attached.After the Shibuya Granbell stay, we slept at the Ginza Mitsui Garden.

It is really well located to the action/transport (and the Airport Limo pickup at the Cerulean) but tucked away enough to give you some peace and quiet. The staff were super friendly and helpful with nothing too much trouble for them. I stayed in one of the modern double rooms which was very comfortable. The bathroom was well stocked with amenities and spotlessly clean as per Tokyo/Japanese standards in general. I wouldn't wish to be spending great lengths of time in the room however and if your are the sort of person that likes to hang out in a room then the Granbell probably isn't the place for you. Free wi-fi was also a plus. Good sized HDTV however a few more cable channels would have been handy. CNN & MTV are all that are on offer in English. Just a couple of small things. The cafe/bar at the front of the hotel is great for a quick, cheap, tasty lunch but not open til 11. The restaurant on level 2 is average for coffee/breakfast and I chose to eat outside of the hotel each morning which was a bit of a hassle. The breakfast is included so I guess you get what you are given. For dinner / lunch however there are some excellent places to eat around the hotel.Also, as it is a small hotel and not a five star, dont expect all of the trimmings. No minibar or a porter to help you out with luggage. In respect to this you basically get what you pay for but as long as you are prepared for that then you are aok...I wasn't and I still survived. lol ;)Example of service: I left a couple of things at the hotel.

It's about a 3 minute walk from the Cerulean Tower (where the airport limo bus drops you and picks you up, if you're going that route). Based on the price we were paying (17,000Y) I had few expectations for the hotel, but was pleasant surprised by the lobby and check-in areas. We were quickly checked in and on our way to our room.The funky elevator lighting and hallway lighting are typical of a mid-range boutique style hotel, and I was very happy with the spotless (albeit compact) room. My previous stays in Tokyo have been at the Intercon and Hilton, with full-size western style rooms, so this was a bit of fun.We cleaned up and hit the town.The next morning we had absolutely no hot water in our room. I went down to the desk to get it looked after, and was immediately given keys for another room so we could shower and be on our way. They asked us to pack up our stuff in case they couldn't rectify the water situation.Upon returning that night we had been given an upgrade to an absolutely cavernous room (just kidding, but at least I could walk around the bed). Kudos to all the hotel staff who made this fix pleasantly and seamlessly for us. Typical Japanese customer service - wish we had that in North America.The breakfasts were just as others have mentioned in their reviews. Unfortunately we are vegetarians, one with a fish allergy, but the waiter got it pretty much right every morning (except the fish sauce packet in the fermented soy beans).The wired internet was fast and worked flawlessly, the wifi somewhat less. If/when I'm back in Tokyo, I will definitely stay here again. The combination of location, price and service is difficult to beat.

It was a good choice - central at only 2-3 minutes walk from Shibuya station, but nicely tucked away so as to be quiet.

The bathroom was great - awesome shower, great products replenished daily and one of those toilet control panels that looks like it belongs on a flight deck.The Japanese breakfast was good, while the western breakfast was not. But hey, when in Japan... what do you expect?Our view wasn't a Tokyo city skyline, but I the side alley we looked over was intriguing nonetheless, and this wasn't the kind of trip where we'd be spending a lot of time in our room - there is too much to see and do. We found this a great base to walk lots of this part of Tokyo, from Shibuya to Harajuku and Meiji-jingu.The staff were efficient, and the kind I would expect to find in a business hotel. There did seem to be a mix of business and leisure clients at this hotel.If we wanted to stay in this part of Tokyo again we would probably stay here.

But now that we know where it is, it's very easy and handy!We wanted to stay somewhere in Shibuya because I wanted to be right in the actions and happenings of Tokyo, day and night. Granbell Hotel Shibuya could not have been better located! It was so close to the Shibuya station, but quite hidden away at the same time, making it a nice and quiet spot to sleep in at night. It is also surrounded by so many restaurants including our favourite yakitori! We're a bit of a foodie and this was a perfectly situated hotel for that!We stayed at the Annex Cozy Suite room and it was as trendy and swanky as it appeared on the website. The living area was more on the ground floor, and it was tiny but functional. The upper floor was where everything else was: the bed, the walk-in wardrobe, the big bathroom (big in Japanese hotel standards), and the ultra modern toilet. There wasn't much of a view but we didn't worry too much about it. The bed was very comfortable but the provided yukata or pyjamas looked ridiculous on us. The amenities and toiletries were very good and abundant (they replenished it daily). The rain shower was GOOD, although we always seemed to make a big puddle outside the shower booth at the end of it. The room has 2 TV's, one in the living room downstairs, and one upstairs facing our bed, and I didn't think there was an English language TV programmes (not that we were interested to watch one). There's free wi-fi in our room. The bedroom itself wasn't that big, but knowing that space is premium in Tokyo, we felt it was spacious enough. Plus the interior design was just so cool, we enjoyed it very much.There was also a complimentary breakfast, a choice of 3 styles of food: western, French and Japanese. They were served in the hotel's restaurant and it was cosy and modest. My partner always picked the western one which consisted of ham or bacon, omelette with ketchup all over it, plus salad and some kind of tasty clear soup. I went for the Japanese one, which was a big meal of hot steamed rice with fried fish fillet, and miso soup, japanese salad, some pickled, nori and fermented soybeans. My sister picked the French one, which was a French toast, same western style of salad and soup. I liked my Japanese breakfast but the western and French ones were average but it was filling and free. The menu didn't change the entire we were there, except the switch between ham and bacon, and type of fish served for the Japanese breakfast.The receptionist staff didn't speak much, and at first I thought they didn't speak enough English but soon realised they spoke and understood good English. They were just not chatty, I guess. I felt the service was up to standard, but nothing more. However, knowing that it was my sister's birthday one day, they left a congratulatory letter and a birthday present in her room which I definitely did not expect. What a nice touch! The present was Japanese confectionaries put together and it was just a pleasant surprise. The hotel staff also passed it on to the teppanyaki restaurant where we booked for the birthday dinner. My sister was surprised with a cheesecake dessert with a sparkler on it! We were most impressed!The exterior and the lobby of the hotel was not much to look at. There's one laptop you could use for internet etc near the receptionist desk. The room was very nice. My sister stayed in the Annex Single room and while it was very small, it was sufficient and the design made it very cosy and comfortable to stay in. The biggest downside was the fact that you have to walk up and down the steps/stairways of the pedestrian bridge across the huge street. It wasn't fun lugging all our bags from and back to Shibuya station, through all those steps. While it is very close, but with heavy bags it did feel like we were walking for miles.","Melbourne, Australia","Ben L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",22,4.0

They staff were very courteous and professional (as everyone is in Tokyo!!)Its only a few minutes walk from Shibuya station, but when you arrive (with heavy luggage) its a bit daunting navigating the pedestrian foot-bridges. The trick is to use the ones which have a ramp in the middle - (when you come out of the west-exit, don't use the steps nearest to you on the left, but cross the road on your right and use the ram to your left).

I came across the Granbell Shibuya purely by accident whilst trying to book another hotel. From the website, it looked quite fresh and was in a convenient location so I decided to give it a go and booked a premiere suite for 6 nights.Firstly, getting there is a problem if you have bulky luggage as I did. I got the Narita Express train to Shinjuku Station and took a cab from there. Of course, this being Tokyo, the driver will have problems if you are not going to a mainstream big hotel. Nevertheless, I called the hotel and the staff guided the driver there. The cab journey should cost no more than 2000 Yen. If you have light luggage, make your way to Shibuya Station (many ways to do so via trains, costs vary, consult your guide book), follow signs to South Gate Exit, go through that gate and take the West exit (its either East or West at the South Gate). You will see a pedestrian ramp bridge, go up that and walk towards the direction of a huge musical instrument shop and then go down the ramp when you’ve reached the end. In front of you, you should see a Kirin City Restaurant, walk towards that, turn right and you should be going up a slight hilly street. The hotel entrance is quite discrete, but look for hairdressers called PROS on your right and the hotel is exactly opposite this. Phew!The lobby and the reception area is quite simply decorated and to be honest, not really that appealing. Check in was fast and efficient, the staff here speak very good English and were polite and professional. I personally thought the lifts had a nice ambience, very glossy and very dark.My suite was on the 8th floor, the theme of the lifts continues through to the corridors only less gloss. There is a vending machine on this floor but I’m not sure if there is one on all floors, sells the usual popular Japanese beverages: cold coffee, cold green/herbal tea, beer and water. My room, and I must stress this is my own personal opinion, was not very well designed. I think my judgement was impaired when I realised there was no desk to work at. From the pictures, you can see that the downstairs area contains nothing but a mirror, other than putting my shoes there, I had no other use for it. The sitting area was cosy and there was a nice Nespresso machine. The TV was a nice 42 inch model, fully 1080p hi definition but when you’re in Tokyo, there are much better things to do than watch TV. The bed was massive but the mattress is a bit hard for my liking, again this is down to personal choice. Also, the hotel is 3 years old now and certainly in my room, there were dents, scratches and scuffs galore. I think the overriding problem with this room was that there was too much emphasis on the freestanding bath, it really took up too much space. My opinion maybe coloured by the fact that I was working and would have preferred more working space. I asked myself the question, if I had been on holiday would I have appreciated this more? Probably not, if spectacular baths are your thing, they have a Bath View suite on the 13th floor which you can have panoramic views across Shibuya whilst taking a bath. One note to add about the washing facilities, the shower was fantastically powerful, however, the flow of water draining is very slow, there were minor floods every night!Breakfast is included, but skip it and explore Shibuya for something better. On a catering note, I ate at both hotel restaurants, one western, one Japanese, both were OK but I wouldn’t want to eat there every night.As for the surrounding area, well, Shibuya is world famous so consult you guidebooks for an in depth review of what’s hot and what’s not.In conclusion, would I stay here again? It’s a yes, but only if it was a personal holiday. The hotel lacks a business centre but there is free ADSL in all rooms (WiFi in suites, cable connection in other rooms). Would I stay in that room again? That’s a definite no, I would pick another suite or maybe a Premier room instead. I did see some of the smaller rooms when they were being cleaned and they are really very small. It’s OK for those who just want to party and crash, but if you like to chill and unwind in your room, get something bigger.Overall, quite impressed with the Granbell Shibuya, it’s a definite plus to the Tokyo hotel scene.

From the immense wooden door that leads you in to the ultra-cool rooms, this place was exactly what I've always been looking for in a vibey Tokyo hotel, but never been able to find. The rooms aren't huge - hey, it's Japan, and Tokyo at that - but go for a deluxe double upgrade and they're more than big enough, and very, very stylish and comfortable.

We stayed here for four nights. My sister joined us for a leg of the journey and stayed in a single room in this hotel. The rooms are very small, so this isn’t a good choice for groups or families. Most of the people staying in the hotel are businessmen, solo travelers, or couples. The restaurant just outside of the hotel (Pop) provides the room service and is truly awful, especially if you’re used to American cuisine. We ate at the restaurant (not room service) once after a long night. We didn’t eat at the hotel restaurant except for breakfast.The hotel décor is sort of pop art/mod and the rooms efficiently use space. This is a big deal staying in Tokyo. The hotel staff was very helpful in helping us to make dinner reservations and the morning continental breakfast was pretty standard for Japan.The location is a couple of blocks from the Shibuya crossing, making it an easy walk to Shibuya and to the train/subway station. It turned out to be a good base for getting around in Tokyo. I usually try to stay in an area of town with nightlife, so that I can easily walk or take a cab back to the hotel late at night. For getting around the city, staying near the Shibuya or Shinjuku stations makes it pretty easy and there is plenty to do at night.The hotel isn’t cheap, but it is Tokyo. I chose this hotel because of the location and price. If I were going back to Shibuya, I would definitely stay at Granbell Hotel.Pros:Location (just outside of Shibuya station)Interior décorHelpful staffCons:Small roomsExpensive, but reasonable for neighborhood.

Despite the room being tiny it was really nice and had everything I needed for a two night stay, comfortable double bed but due to the size of the room it can only be accessed from one side as the other three sides are up against the wall which gives you an idea of the length of the room. Great glass enclosed shower room with a fantastic shower with both a rainhead shower and handheld shower and a very high tech automated washlet which to my surprise had the seat pre-heated. The shower room is exposed to the bedroom but does have a curtain that you can pull across for privacy, but given the size of the room I doubt it would be suitable for two people and if it was they would probably not be concerned about privacy. I paid 10,400 Yen per night and at the time the Australian $ was above 95 yen to the dollar which made the hotel great value for Tokyo. Unlike some other hotels I have stayed at in Tokyo this hotel had a nice outlook from the room looking back towards Shibuya Station, nothing outstanding but better than a brick wall a metre away like in some. The staff were very helpful and was able to check in a little before the normal check in time. The lobby isn’t very big and isn’t one designed to spend any time in like some, there is a café/bar at the front on street level which I didn’t use. The rate I booked didn’t include breakfast but for some reason I was given a voucher for breakfast on one day which was taken in the hotel restaurant on the first floor, It is not a buffet style as in most hotels but rather a choice of three or four set menus and don’t assume like I did that half boiled egg was a misprint for hard boiled egg, it is actually only half cooked. The room had a full set of amenities, shampoo, razor, toothbrush, small fridge, free internet access nice little LCD TV, safe big enough for a laptop but strangely located in a drawer with an opening top. There isn’t much room for suitcases or clothes just a few hooks on the wall to hang a few things and your suitcases will be on display all the time. There is a ledge under the window which came in handy for putting a few things on and there is a small cupboard under the window that has a small folding stool in it for a visitor I guess.The only odd thing about the hotel was that in the corridor on my floor there was a very strong smell, not unpleasant and in the end I pit it down to the new construction that had just been completed it was kind of like a new car smell, but probably well and truly gone by now.Overall I think this is a terrific hotel in a great location and if you want more room they do have bigger rooms available at bigger prices. One of the great things about Japanese hotels is that they do seem to have a variery of room sizes with corresponding prices so if you want to save money you can stay in a small room and pay a smaller price.",Australia,"minicooperdownunder</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",126,5.0

We had 48 hours to experience essential Tokyo during a long layover on way to Australia. I did much research and chose Shibuya / Granbell as being ""on the grid"" of the Yamanote Line which would take us to the top10 attractions we'd have time to see. Their staff was very helpful answering my many emailed questions in advance. I paid them extra to have a bouquet of local flowers waiting in the room and they did great. We got non-smoking Comfort Deluxe double for 14700/16800 yen which was awesome deal & we did it by watching occupancy on website and waiting till 15 days before, when the price dropped because they still had vacancy. Risky strategy & worked for us in Feb offseason during global financial meltdown; YMMV. We took limo bus from Narita which was fairly cheap and direct, but be sure to have a copy of the Cerulean-to-Granbell map as the final 4 blocks are not obvious and nobody speaks English. The Granbell is very close to Shibuya station and the JR Yamanote line worked great for us to hit top10 attractions -- just bring cash 'cause our American VISA was not accepted and many ATM's in area wouldn't take our card; eventually we found 7-11 AMT that worked; you might wanna get cash at airport. We did all-day passes for JR and that worked great. Breakfast was comforting, good, all-you-can-eat. We stayed in annex and room was surprisingly large after reading reviews here but also we were in Comfort Double. Electric bidet toilet is an eye-opener. During day we shared an elevator ride with a classy pretty but yes-for-sure-you're-a-call-girl worker. Some ppl are bothered by that and yes it is there. Internet used a cable, was fast, free, no problems with it. USA-style working outlet available in our room for laptop. Desk had 24/7 staff available. Building felt very secure, safe, good neighborhood. When flying out, we took Yamanote Line to Ueno and the Kesei Limited Express from there to airport 'cause by then we were experts.","Seattle, WA","disabled05</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, WA</strong>",36,5.0

I booked a single room on the hotel webstie at a rate of 11,000 Yen per night. After checking in, I found myself in a tiny, suffocating room. There was no space to turn around, no storage space for luggage, and no desk to work or even open the laptop. Nice details, but too small to be true! Thus, for only 3,500 Yen per night I upgraded to a Double Room, single use. The room was larger, with one desk plus a round table, queen size bed, storage space for clothes. Overall feelins is that the hotel is clean, modern, sleek and service very attentive. Staff was very polite - not a surprise in Japan.Breakfast was OK, nothing special. There are several coffee shops and bars around, so you could always choose something else. I wouldn't recommend the single room, it is really small. OK, this is Japan, but it doesn't mean you have to suffocate in a 10 square meter room for 150 USD per night. I would definitively recommend the double room instead.

The bathroom is enclosed in glass to let in the light, and it was well appointed with awesome water pressure. If you were planning to squeeze a second person into the slightly-larger-than-normal single bed, hopefully you won't mind watching them shower.Service was fine, but I didn't do anything more than check in and check out. I didn't ask any questions regarding sight seeing etc. so I can't comment on that.If you're anything like me you look for some clear directions in Trip Advisor reviews to find hotels, so here's some directions you might find helpful. A quick look on Google Earth helps as well!I grabbed the NEX / Suica option to get from Narita (a great deal). As it was an early trip in, I had to change from the Narita Express to Yamanote at Shinagawa, which is a smaller station so getting from one line to the other was a breeze.When you get to Shibuya, make your way to the West Exit. Plenty of signs point the way. When you exit, you'll face a number of bus stops - head left past the toilets and straight up the stairs which go across the road but below the overpass. Keep walking and head down the stairs in front of you. You'll walk along the road which has the red paving leading out of it. A short walk along this road will lead to an intersection - walk up the hill on the road which has the circular paving (it's on the right).

It is also only a 5 minute walk to the shops, restaurants and bars of Shibuya.Our room was a good size for Tokyo, ie not cramped and had a very nice shower and bath. The bed was a king size and was very comfortable and we didn't notice any noise during the night.If you are into cool, hip, boutique style hotels in a great location then I would definately recommend staying here. A hint for anyone who has not travelled to Tokyo before, if you are using taxis get your hotel to write down your destination in Japanese to give to the driver as most do not read / understand English.",Hong Kong,"Daltz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",12,4.0
