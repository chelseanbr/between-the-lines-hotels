They went well beyond what they needed to on every visit I made in a way that was memorable for me. Second, the place is clean, well located and never had an issue with anything in the room working as expected. Big plus. The location is helped a lot in my opinion by a restaurant on premises (Ketch Brewhouse) which is handy even if the menu is just ok. Nice to have it. There are also many restaurants within a block and tables and a small “park” with tables just outside the front door. I enjoy staying here on my frequent business trips for all these reasons. The only reason this is not 5 stars is because there are a few buildings immediately adjacent that are vacant and dilapidated and there were vermin running around at night.

I booked it through a third party booking app. I produced my credit card and was charged for the first night upon check in, which was normal.When I was checking out, I was charged the full amount of the invoice, so I mentioned that the first night had already been paid for and I should have just paid for the balance of the invoice. The Guest Service Officer in charge at the time assured me that the first night would be reversed, and that this was a normal procedure at FPBS.Since then, I have been waiting for the reversal and nothing has happened. I am still overcharged by $200+ and trying to contact the accountant to resolve this matter has proven to be mission impossible.I have called FPBS numerous times to try to speak to the accountant and every time I called Ms. Cynthia Jing, “the only person in the whole company who has the authority to reverse transactions”, seemed to be having her day off. Ms. Katherine Rosario, a Guest Service Officer whom I spoke to before Christmas, had “personally” asked me to give her a chance to bring this up to Cynthia and “personally” given me her word to resolve this issue. I even sent Ms. Rosario and Ms. Jing both a direct e-mail as per Ms. Rosario’s request, and neither has ever replied to my e-mail.The last time I spoke to Ms. Rosario was this morning (and of course Ms. Jing was absent again today), and I asked her to just let me talk to anyone who might be able to help me. I even said, “Cynthia can’t be the only one in the whole company authorized to reverse a transaction. If she dies today, no one else can do anything with accounts?” She then put me on hold for almost 15 minutes only to get to an answering machine. I hung up.This whole overcharging drama has left me no other choice but to write this rather unfortunate event here. I have been holding it off for more than a month, giving FPBS a chance to do what they said they would. The most disappointing part is not the overcharge itself. It’s the way the staff deals with the issue, not replying to my e-mails, giving empty promises, and not having the courtesy to actually solve the problem.It’s too bad, because the actual stay at FPBS was quite lovely, despite minor issues with the housekeeping. If anyone at FPBS still has the decency to return my calls and e-mails, fine. If not, then let my story be known to everyone who is considering to stay at FPBS New York Downtown.

The standard room was small, which was to be expected of a NYC hotel, and the corner room was nice - we hang out here after a long day of walking since it was the bigger one out of the two. Surprisingly, the bathroom is decently sized and I liked that both rooms had stand up showers which I prefer over bath tubs. Rooms were still new, carpets were clean - a really nice Four Points. The hotel is located 3-5 minutes away from Fulton station - we followed signs for William Street exit. We walked to Battery Park, World Trade Center, and Brooklyn Bridge from the hotel and are closely located to the hotel. We drove in to NYC and had to park our car in the garage behind the hotel (put 201 Pearl St on your GPS) and paid $32 per night with hotel validation. On our first night, the fire alarm went off for about 10 minutes and the Fire Department came as quick as can be. We stayed in the room and waited for announcements and were informed it was a false alarm, luckily - we were located on the 19th floor and can’t imagine having to go down 19 flights of stairs. The alarm did not bother us at all as we had just gone to bed and understand that it is for our own safety. Overall, our stay was great and will stay here again the next time we visit NYC. Reading previous reviews though, I am so inclined to give my two cents to the person who rated the hotel two stars saying she was “infuriated.” First of all, based on my understanding, Marriott Friends and Family rate is for pleasure stays ONLY and NOT for business. You should be grateful for the priviledge you have of a discounted stay. If your stay did no go as planned, think of the discount you are getting compared to the regular rate you were to pay if you did not have a family or a friend working for the Marriott chain of hotels. So with this discount, you have already been compensated for your troubles. Consider acting accordingly as well, this may cause your friend or family’s job, they are indeed responsible for you. Second, you opted to stay in NEW YORK CITY - if you are trying to do business work, DO NOT stay in the city! Construction is everywhere and the hotel does not have control over any construction in the surrounding area. Third, your comments say you discussed “options of extending your stay” - I don’t think this meant “comping your stay.” So don’t blame the agent for not comping your stay, I am sure you did not deserve getting a comp stay. Four, why stay at a hotel if you know you don’t have the money to pay for the stay and expect the hotel to comp your stay? How is this the hotel’s problem? Having to borrow money to pay for your stay does not justify your low rating for this hotel. Lastly, the fire alarm does not also justify for any compensation - it is there for our own safety. If it did not go off in case of a real fire, I guess you just have to be thankful since you did not want to be bothered anyway on your “business trip.” So my advice, stop complaining and think twice when you are on a discounted rate - Employee discounted rates to be exact. Consider the amount you are saving over the troubles you may be experiencing. Perhaps staying outside the city may be the best option the next time you go on a business trip in New York. That is all.","Toronto, Canada","WanderLeigh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",4,5.0

Most of my business calls I planned to do in my room and take my in person meetings nearby. Upon check in there was no notification (at least to me) that there would be loud construction in our hotel from 9AM - 4PM the entire week. Twice the construction was so bad I physically had to walk down to a co working space and pay for a soundproof room. When I made it aware to the staff downstairs Bria was nice enough to offer me two drink vouchers, but I do not drink. We then discussed another option in extending my stay. She told me she would gladly extend my stay but could not adjust my daily rate since I was on an explore family and friends rate. What she failed to throughly explain was that she did not plan to comp the additional day. When it came time to check out she gave me a different total than what I was expecting. When I looked her in her eyes and said “the additional day was supposed to be comped” she didn’t take accountability. She even called her manager and there was nothing done. I left having to borrow money to close out the rest of my reservation. Not to mention there was a accidental fire alarm at 1AM that went on into afternoon on my last night, and no one was compensated for the trouble. My day rate was low but this is besides the point. Bria, the front desk clerk did not take accountability for what we agreed upon the night before. I would have never agreed to pay MORE to stay in a hotel with issues. The lack of understanding and accountability management and the front desk clerks took was unbelievable. They based what the $ amount of my day rate was on their final decision instead of just doing the right thing. I had a great conversation and received helpful vegan suggestions from one of the managers Katherine. However, I’m extremely upset with the way Bria looked me right in the eyes and claimed to have not agreed to comp my extended evening. Again, Why would I agree to pay for an additional night when I had to PAY to leave my own hotel more than once just to take my business calls due to construction, false alarms and other disturbances. Staff is nice but I was so infuriated after that check out experience I had to write this review. Another manager (Domonique) was called by Bria and informed of the situation. Instead of truly investigating the situation, she said my family member who offered me the opportunity to use the explore rate would be responsible. (Which was equally infuriating) Not only are my husband and myself loyal Marriott members. My family member who offered this explore rate has been with the company for almost 20 years. We are also Hilton time share owners and had the opportunity to stay in a Hilton property nearby booked on solid points and chose your property instead.

Although the location was perfect, we had several issues with our room that were not resolved. The major issue was that our a/c wouldn't cool and only the fan would run. This left our room at 79 degrees when it was set on 67! We notified the front desk on our way out for the day and was assured someone would come take a look at it. When we arrived back at 10:30pm the room was the same temp and we had no notification if anyone had actually come to fix it. Since it was so late and we were due to leave the following morning we just let it go until checkout. Second issue was that housekeeping left NO clean towels one day and only left a note on the bed saying they would be delivered when available. We still had zero towels when we arrived back at 10:30 that night. After calling the front desk TWICE to request some, we finally got 2 bath towels an HOUR and 15 mins later! We were livid that we had to wait that long as we had just wanted to shower before getting into bed after having a hot/humid day in the city. Lastly, we also had one of the vanity light bulbs go out in the bathroom, and even after notifying the front desk it was not taken care of. I complained to the front desk about our issues when we checked out and they took my friend's email since she had reserved our room and mentioned possibly getting a discount of some sort, but I really doubt that will happen given how they couldn't even follow through on any of these issues.

The manager finally gets it correct but we still had to wait another hour to check in and get our key cards.

Of course we knew that info was wrong because we have email confirmations stating otherwise. My friend is going back and forth with the people at the front desk and one point they DID NOT want to compensate or compromise. The whole room situation was an inconvenience because they over booked and could not give us what we booked. We couldn’t do anything about that. We were promised extra pull out beds but NEVER GOT ANY. We would ask for towels it would take 30mins to come to our rooms. At one point we asked for towels and the associate got an attitude about us wanting 6 towels. So customer service was bad, however the only person that was nice to us and did his best to make sure we got what we needed was Calvin. When we talked to him he was able to get us one pull out bed and was able to authorize a lower rate for our hotel stay. He was very sweet and his service was great.

I have no idea what their problem was given the restaurant was empty and I was there for less than half an hour so I can't understand the rush of throwing me out. Maybe they could occupy themselves with waiting at the front entrance to seat diners instead of annoying the ones who made it in?If you can get a reasonable price for this hotel, I would recommend it (I would probably go somewhere else for breakfast if you can though, the food was nothing special and the staff too imposing).

The rates vary depending on the day of the week and time of year, but overall found them to be reasonable and I think you get more value for money. The room size is good, along with the service, cleanliness of rooms, sufficient storage and power points. Less than 300m from the office, it was very convenient. The only down side was once when I ordered room service for breakfast, fruit and a croissant, it was fairly poor, the tea was cold and for $20 - expensive. I’ve also stayed at the Marriott, which is also good, but always more expensive for the same standard as the Sheraton and Club Quarters, which is absolutely awful, avoid if you can.

No water came out. After three failed attempts to call for service, I finally managed to get through. A technician came up, declared he needed support, went down, came up, declared he needed guidance, called someone and decided I had to wait till the next morning for it to be fixed. The hotel wanted to move me to another room but I had unpacked for the day, it was almost midnight and I was exhausted so I asked for another room (402) just for my shower, and they could fix the shower the following day. The next day (today, Jun 10), I reminded the (different) counter staff about my ordeal. I told them I would go out till about 1pm and they could try to fix it. If they couldn’t, please leave a note so I know what the outcome was, as it was so difficult to get anyone to pick up the phone when I called. When I returned, there was no note. I decided to go out again to give them more time. By the time I got back to my room for the night at about 7pm I tried the shower. It still didn’t work and there was still no note or communication from staff. I decided to go to room 402 for my shower, only to realise to my dismay the hotel cancelled my access to my shower room without telling me before. So I had to now go back to the lobby to ask them for an update. This third staff had no idea what happened so I had to explain it all over again. She insisted that I had to change my rooms as the hotel needed more than 2 days to repair the tap. When I packed and moved my luggage to the other room and collected my new key card, I had not a single word of apology, even though I thanked them for the card (but not for all the misery and inconvenience I’d never encountered in my 15 years of international business travel, let alone from a Sheraton property). Guys, things break down. I get it. But service recovery is all it takes. Apologise, show sincerity and empathy for the troubles you’ve created for your guests and try to make it up to them. I struggle to believe I have to say this to an international chain in an international city. ","Novena, Singapore","803willyy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Novena, Singapore</strong>",1,1.0

My husband and I spent two nights at this property in April. We called SPG directly and booked a “corner king, city view room.” Apparently, the booking came thru to the hotel as a standard room. We had a view of what looked like the interior of an elevator shaft. This was our honeymoon. Akim at the front desk offered to knock $40 / night off the rate to make up for the inconvenience, promised me that he would be working when we checked, and that he would take care of everything. He was not working the morning when we checked out (Sunday). The bill came in at a higher nightly rate than initially agreed upon, with no discount given, and two additional and unaccounted for $50 and $80+ charges. I asked to speak with a manager and was told there was no manager on sight. I asked for a business card for the general manager and was told one would have to be handwritten, as he doesn’t have business cards (his name is Arthur Cheung). Theresa, at the front desk, talked to me about options and offered to “hug it out” with me. I declined. Theresa then attempted to modify my bill but after three failed attempts told me she would have to get someone above her to correct the bill and assured me that it would be rectified by 7pm that evening. At 5:30pm I received a “revised and final” bill from the property that changed nothing. Theresa emailed me the next day (Monday) saying that billing had been taken out of her hands but that people were looking into the issue. Theresa’s email was the final communication I received from the hotel. The next day (Tuesday) I called SPG and spoke with two different CSRs, Jessica and Derrick, before being transferred to a supervisor, John, who assured me that everything would be taken care of within 48 hours, during which time I would hear directly from the hotel. 72 hours later, I had heard nothing from John or anyone at the hotel so I called SPG again only to be told that John wasn’t working. Pilar, who I spoke with, offered me a choice of 10,000 SPG points or a $100 refund check that would take up to 21 days to arrive. I opted for the money. 33 days later I had still not received a check from SPG, so I called and spoke with another Jessica who transferred me to a supervisor, Louise, who told me that the check had only been submitted for processing 6 days prior (that's 27 days, if you're counting), but she would request that it be mailed ASAP. I asked Louise if she thought this customer service experience was acceptable; she declined to answer. I asked what SPG might do to retain me as a customer going forward and again Louise had no answer. She then offered me 3,000 points, thanked me for calling SPG, and hung up.If anyone from SPG corporate wants to rectify this absurd situation I am happy to be contacted. Until then, I plan on avoiding the Four Points by Sheraton Downtown NYC and all other SPG / Marriott properties unless someone else is footing the bill.

There was a small desk and sufficient storage space for clothes - we missed some clothes pegs in the room, though.The bathroom had a basin, a mirror and a shower (of the stupid variety with a fixed shower head). The water pressure could have been better - turning this down to save energy does not help when you have to stay twice as long in the shower to rinse off.The air conditioning was easy to adjust, but quite noisy!

There was very little noise to be heard from the outside, though (this might be different in a front-facing room on a low floor).Housekeeping was mostly good. The hotel has a system where you hang a special sign on the door if you don't need housekeeping, this is supposed to give you a restaurant voucher. We never got those. Also, when we pulled out the bed from the wall on the last night to check if we had dropped anything behind it, we found lots of dust bunnies and leftover stuff from previous guests. Some of these items vere quite unpleasant to find, but as we had stayed one week already we did not take the offer of having the room thoroughly cleaned.I'd be happy to come back, but the hotel should improve their cleaning routine.

We stayed on the 11th floor which was fine, elevator access was fast and efficient. Our room was bigger than I had expected based on the reviews, but was big enough for what we needed it for (a base) I mean who goes to New York to sit in a room? Storage was a slight problem, we all lived out of the suitcases and stored them near to the door which was not a huge problem to be honest, the complimentary tea, coffee and water was gratefully received and was replenished every day, there was one occasion where they forgot to leave the coffee pods but we mentioned it to the staff on reception and they sent a staff member up with them within minutes. The hotel has free wifi which was great for the kids and also computers and a printer in the main Reception. Complimentary tea and coffee is also available in the hotel lobby.

The Ketch Brewhouse which is part of the hotel is a lovely, friendly place with some great happy hour deals and the food is reasonable and very very nice!!

Knowing that I was going to be out and about that night, I requested a late check out, which was granted until 4 pm. To my surprise, and only complain, the cleaning crew starts knocking and/or opening your room door literally every hour after 10 am despite the fact that the “later” label was outside door. It seems like there’s a little bit of a disconnect between the front desk and everyone else, or that housekeeping don’t really care if the “later” sign is outside, or if you already told them 4 times to come back later, don’t worry, they will keep coming until you finally get upset enough to leave the premises, restless, and with a bad taste in your mouth. So my advice is that if you’re planning on sleeping later than 10 am, you might want to stay somewhere else.

After making this trip dozens of times, I've stayed at every 3.5-4.5 star hotel in the area, and can guess the hotel based on the amenities and rating in the website listing. For my most recent trip earlier this week, I booked one I didn't recognize and ended up at the Sheraton Four Points New York Downtown. I was looking forward to the stay because I hadn't been there before, but two nights at this hotel has convinced me to stick with the hotels I know from now on. On arrival, the front desk staff was friendly and welcoming, but told me that my reservation in their system showed me arriving the following night. This was even after I called the hotel the previous night to confirm the reservation for the dates on the booking confirmation email from the website. Also, they told me the credit card I gave them for incidentals was rejected, but I found out later it was perfectly fine. When I got to the room, I was shocked by how tiny it was, even by NYC standards. There was only enough room to walk around the bed. There was a desk with an upholstered cube tucked underneath in lieu of a proper chair, and a small bench under the window with a single tiny drawer for folded clothes. I set my carry-on suitcase on that bench to unpack, then realized that there was nowhere to hang up clothes. There was a wardrobe about 14 inches in width with a small hook screwed to the back, on which two hangers were hung. No bar, just the hook. After looking around for an actual closet, I realized that this is where they were expecting people to hang up their clothes. I have never stayed at a hotel that doesn't provide a bar - somewhere, anywhere - for hanging up clothes, including 2.5 - 3 star hotels in warm-weather leisure destinations where one could argue you wouldn't need it. Who during the design of this hotel decided that this would be acceptable in Downtown New York City, arguably the epicenter of the global business?In the far corner of the room was a corner window with a great view, 75% of which was blocked by curtains that opened inward toward the corner rather than out past the edges of the window. The area around the window was incredibly drafty, leaving the entire room freezing unless the heater was running. The heater vent was on the other side of the room from the window, with the bed in the middle, so at night I was either freezing cold or stifling hot. The AC/heater was also so loud that it woke me up several times. Also, operation of the AC in the room required a room key to be placed in a slot by the door, but I wasn't told about this at check-in and there were no instructions on the thermostat, so I initially thought the heater was broken.Finally, the pillows were by far the most uncomfortable I've ever encountered. There were four of them on the bed and all four stacked up, when pressed down under my head, barely equaled the thickness and support of a normal pillow.I am sure that I was given this room because I took advantage of the ""secret hotel"" deal the hotel offered on a well-known booking website, if only because there's no way this hotel would still be in business if every guest's experience was like mine. I have suspected this is a common practice and temper my expectations accordingly, but the rooms I'm assigned by other hotels in the area are spacious and luxurious compared to my room at the Sheraton Four Points New York Downtown. I will never stay there again, even at a third of the price I paid on this trip.","Oviedo, Florida","GowiththeFlo-rida</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oviedo, Florida</strong>",8,2.0

Positives:Location - I have perviously stayed (2 visits) in midtown near the main attractions but at this time of year they were all ridiculously expensive. This hotel was a great price and the location had plenty to offer. I found the financial district great. Literally no walk to Ground Zero, Stanton Island ferry etc. Very easy access to Fulton Subway which meant midtown and Central Park were only 15 min awayGreat bars - there are some great bars and restaurants to visit. The highly recommended Dead Rabbit (one of the best in New York) it’s just round the corner Bed - mega comfy, excellent nights sleep Plugs / USB charging - so many! These days this is a must and the room delivers (and some)Staff - we didn’t have any need to speak too much to the staff but check in (and out) were quick, efficient and polite. Negatives:Rooms - as mentioned already in other reviews, they are very small. I would avoid the corner rooms (although you do get two windows). Overall these rooms aren’t worse than other New York hotels but the lack of storage exacerbates the problem (see below). Storage - there is literally none. This wouldn’t be so much of an issue if there was somewhere to store your suitcase. I have stayed in other very small rooms but they have the raised beds that allow you to store your suitcase underneath. The beds here were high enough to allow for this but they didn’t. This would be a massive improvement. This didn’t affect our enjoyment of the stay, just seems like something that could be improved.  Overall I would highly recommended the hotel.

You expect a big chain to be rather impersonal when it comes to decoration, little details, etc but, at the same time, you expect the friendlier staff, great service, bigger rooms and an overall touch of class which we definitely miss this time around.In saying that, if you get a good deal, it is worth the stay.

Even so, Four Points managed to be slightly cheaper than its competitors (at almost 300 dollars per night including tax).With that caveat, the experience wasn't all that bad; check-in/out were brisk, if a little impersonal. The room was rather small, designed for the convenience of single travellers, but somewhat redeemed by windows on two sides of the wall, giving an illusion of space. Amenities within the room were in keeping with average 2-3 star hotels (paper cups and no slippers), although the bed was surprisingly comfortable. The A/C can be quite loud at unpredictable times, a potential issue in high summer. Due to time constraints, had to order breakfast at the restaurant attached to the hotel, and was suitably disappointed with rather greasy omelette and potato wedges, but then again, the neighbourhood isn't all that well-known for good food choices anyways.So, with the caveat that one is paying for seasonal New York prices, the general experience was quite all right, and maybe that is all that one could wish for when staying in mid-range chains like Four Points.","Los Angeles, California","CSorley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",8,4.0

Since I couldn't see a sign or something I had to walk around for 15 minutes in the cold trying to find this place. I called their number and the guest service associate that answered was no help and basically short and rude on the phone. Anyway, I made it there and she looked at me up and down and was like ""you staying here"" as if people like me couldnt stay here"". I was like yeah, she gave a look again and was like ""you can come here"". She was very rude for someone in front desk, when I asked her some question about where I could find food, she gave a Chinese food take out menu and that was it. I came downstairs and had to change my keys because they were inactivated, this time I met a gentlmean who was no better. Dont get me wrong, yeah I know it's new York and people are rude there but I thought that Sheraton would want their guests to fill at home and feel welcome. As far as the room, they very small and barely any place to move and it feels like a prison cell, but then again this might explain why the front guest acted like they did.

I booked a corner queen room because I found it online for CHEAP. It was worth the approx $175 total I paid to stay in Manhattan and the bed was one of the better hotel beds I have ever slept in. However, the room just barely fits that bed. There is a very narrow desk that doesn't even have a chair because there is no room. Also no real closet - just a cabinet that would accommodate shirts but not pants or dresses. I am glad I was staying by myself - there was not room for two people in the room. Also, although the room seemed clean, the hotel itself did not. There was a discarded Wendy's soda cup on the credenza next to the elevator on my floor for my entire stay. There was also paper on the floor in the hallways. The lobby was littered with suitcases randomly scattered throughout out. Didn't inspire confidence in me that the place was keeping a careful watch on people's suitcases (I am guessing they had been dropped off for people who arrived before checkin in). Although the bed was comfy, I didn't sleep well. I have stayed across the courtyard at Gild Hall and in my sister's apartment (106 John) before and slept well. However, I could hear every noise outside at this place. In short, if you are looking for an economy stay and don't really want to be impressed, this is your place.

I must have called this number 30-40 times over several days and not once was the phone answered, I left numerous messages on the answering machine and to this day never received a callback from that office. Now I checked out of the hotel on Aug 7th and was told by the front desk and a manager of the hotel that the room was thoroughly searched for this passport but to no avail. Now on August 29th I received an email telling me the hotel has found the passport in question. Great they found the passport 3 weeks later, I guess somebody new actually cleaned the room and did their job and looked for items left behind. I am assuming the person or persons who say they looked in room either lied to me or lied to their supervisors, which is a problem onto itself, but the saga continues, I contact the hotel they tell me they have the passport, I personally travel to the hotel 3 times and each time I am told that yes they have it but it is locked in the house keeping office and they cant access the safe. I am assured each time that they will notify the house keeping supervisor( Kai) and he will leave it with the front desk. This never happened until today Sept 4th I finally get the email to another manager at hotel Maurice Joyner who assures me she will have this rectified by 1pm. Thank God I finally talk to someone who tells me the truth. this manager has Kai contact me and finally he tells me the passport will be left at front desk.

In closing the hotel is fine as long as you dont need the staff to go out of their way to help you in anyway. The fact that I have been ignored and lied to is really a problem with me at this point.

Absolutely recommend the structure in the middle of downtown Manhattan. Wall Street and One World Trade Centre are just few minutes away and the area is 100% safe, plus being this the financial district of the city it is not as cahotic and loud as other districts on the island. The only problem we experienced was with the wi-fi (slow to connect and even when connected wouldn't always allow us to navigate) but to be honest we didn't even ask the staff for help as we had our mobile internet, so wouldn't consider this an issue.

There was no in-room fridge or even mini-bar. Ice is available only on the 2nd floor of the hotel or by calling guest services (we were on the 23rd floor). The ""green"" option for housekeeping actually means NO housekeeping whatsoever - they don't refresh coffee or even empty the trash. We requested the ""green"" option the first night & when we asked about trash removal were told that housekeeping won't enter the room if the ""green"" sign is on the door. However, it was OBVIOUS that someone had been in the room - lights were left on and a piece of cardboard jammed into the wall socket to keep the lights on. When we informed the front desk, they had no response - just looked embarrassed. There was no guide to the local area (or map available at the front desk) & no guide to the channels on the TV in-room or on request. The front desk could not reserve a table at the in-hotel restaurant but instead put us through to the restaurant where it took forever to get an answer and then we were disconnected TWICE. The food in-room and at the in-hotel restaurant is mediocre and over-priced. There are no palatable vegetarian and no vegan options. There are few decent restaurants in immediate walking distance unless you like ""family fare"" Italian. When asked the best way for my 80+ mother to get from the hotel to the station, the clueless woman at the front desk suggested taking ""the train"" although 80+ should've been a clue and trains weren't running to the stop near the hotel. Unlike every other hotel in Manhattan, the front desk couldn't even suggest a car service but instead suggested she walk several blocks to a ""taxi line"" (there isn't one nearby).

Located very near Fulton Street Subway station, I found this hotel a great choice to stay in terms of pricing, location, convenience to reach some of the popular tourist spots and with a good collection of eateries. This was my first trip to New York and hence I can't compare this with another hotel or location.Pricing: For under 300 $, this was a nice deal. No complimentary breakfast with the plan I selected. Rooms near midtown around Times Square were far more expensive.Location: If I were to stay around Penns station, it would have felt like a journey downtown to the Brooklyn bridge, Wall Street and Staten Island/Statue of Liberty. However, with these locations at a walking distance and Fulton st. subway just a few steps away, I feel staying here and taking a subway to go to midtown would be a better way to ensure that you cover both areas well. You can roam around Times Square and Madison Garden till late night and get back using the A train. If it isn't raining, you can walk up to Brooklyn bridge and also to the Staten Island ferry. Take a subway or a bus to Midtown and you can get down right next to Times Square (Subway train A).Another advantage with Fulton street subway station is that you get a direct train (A) from Howard Station next to JFK. You would need to go till Jamaica and change over if you were to go to Penns. I don't know - felt Howard was easy given that it's attached to JFK.Cabs in NY are expensive! I paid 65$ on my way back to the airport as I had some heavy bags to carry. My trip was impacted due to continuous rain and I didn't have the mood to carry my luggage till the subway station.There are plenty of cycle rental shops nearby - another great way to roam around the city.Shopping: If you are in to discount shopping, try Lot Less at 95 Fulton Street. There is a Real Deal dollar N discount at 59 John St. - at a stone's throw from the hotel.Eateries: You will find all cuisines in plenty. Ketch Brewhouse attached to the hotel was nice too, a bit on the pricier side. There is a McD and another hot dog place (can't recollect the name) opposite to Lot-Less at Fulton street that are open 24 hours. So, if you are in to walking around in the night or return to the hotel really late, there is something open to grab a bite.Rooms: Fairly spacious, bathroom was fine with a tiny bathtub. Nothing much to complain there. Worth the price indeed. Folks at the front desk were very helpful with useful tips to go around.One thing I really loved was USB charging ports in the room - in plenty. It was so easy to charge cellphone and other USB chargeable devices. Being from India, taking out a universal adapter and hooking it up was a bit of a planned effort. Presence of USB chargers in the room helped a lot.Room has standard accessories like a coffee machine and iron box.I would like to come back and spend like 5 nights to see New York as my first trip was marred by rain. I did what I could in terms of shopping and walking around, but another week of vacation is due. I'd prefer the same hotel.Note: You will find some hotels near Long Island that are cheaper than the downtown four points. Though in the map it looks like it's just 5 miles, I felt it is not a place where you would want to walk in the middle of the night. Going to midtown/downtown and returning will require some planning if you were to choose Long Island.","Bengaluru, India","shefeeqyr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bengaluru, India</strong>",22,5.0

It's not as close to other things in Manhattan, but I knew that going into it. The rooms were large and well appointed. I had room service one or two nights, and that was well appointed. We were in a handicap accessible bathroom due to check-in time, and as a result we had a handicap shower. This did become my nemesis on the trip because the water would never stay on. I called down once or twice to have them show me how to do it properly, and I could still never figure it out. I assume it was due to the handicap features, so most rooms are probably not like that.

That's obviously a very good rate for anywhere in New York in March, but when you stay here, it's pretty easy to understand why the rate is that low.First, it's a pretty basic hotel. That's fine by me - I just need a bed, a shower, a decent desk and WiFi - but anyone wanting luxury should look elsewhere. But the second reason for the good rates is that there is a construction site right next to the hotel that seems to get noisier at night.Seriously, I have never stayed in a noisier hotel room in my whole life. It was astonishingly loud, and on the first night in particular, seemed to intensify at 3am. It takes a lot to wake me once I am asleep, but this place managed it.Obviously this is no fault of the hotel as such (although better double-glazing might have kept the noise down a bit) but I would be far happier to stay here again once the building next door is complete.By the way, I was on the 7th floor, more or less directly above the construction site.

I always do a bed and bathroom check wherever I stay. Every part of our room was spotless and stain free! The employees were professional and kind.

Nice bed linens, room was clean, elevators worked and came frequently, security seemed good, facility seemed quiet and clean and up-to-date overall. For us, the location was perfect. It's close to the Seaport area in the Financial District. Medium news: Your previous experience with hotels in large cities (NYC, London, Rome, etc) will determine your feeling about the size of these hotel rooms. There is just enough space for the beds and a small pathway to navigate around them. This is not a fault of the hotel; just know that if you are paying less-than-exorbitant rates in NYC, your room will be tight.Not-so-good:Room wasn't ready when we arrived after 6pm. We had to return after 8pm. Desk staff very friendly but powerless to solve this problem, which arose due to cleaning staff shortage. But while standing at the front desk for A Very Long Time, I had the opportunity to notice all kinds of misplaced items in full sight behind the desk: food wrappers, overflowing trash, half-eaten dinners of staff members, random stuff (folders, purse) placed here and there. It was very unprofessional. I hate to complain about free coffee, but the coffee carafes in the lobby were empty both mornings. It seems there were not enough staff members to take care of all the work of the hotel.I would stay here again if the price beat that of nearby competitors. Rooms are decidedly nicer than those at the Holiday Inn Express Wall Street (which is actually on Water Street) around the corner.

The federal reserve building is a block away. It was so easy to take the train anywhere we wanted to go. We were able to get to all the NYC tourist stops. We arrived at the hotel around 11. We knew that a room wouldn't be ready however we were okay with that. The front desk staff tagged our luggage and we were able to enjoy the city for the day. They secured it to a back room. Once we returned later at night our check in process was smooth. There was a bar/restaurant attached to,the hotel however we did not take advantage of it.

I have also extensive experience in the hotel industry as a manager so will always look at the situation regarding hotel-stays from 2 different points. I will definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone, especially not families. Most staff is very unhelpful and unfriendly service from most of the staff, like Lauren and Leatichia at Front desk, and Adriaan in Restaurant. Staff on Front desk really not helpful at all- except Elizabeth, Michael and Alex. Rooms really small-basically just enough room to walk around bed. Hotel has 29 floors and around 10 rooms on every level, all allocated around the elevator area. Elevator from floor 20 and upwards really noisy, and if you are located at front of hotel also very noisy with music playing from 5pm from speakers at Entrance of hotel. (apparently to lure people into the hotel, they don't seem to care about the guest already paying to stay at the hotel.) Water pressure comes and goes, and A/C in one of our rooms needed resetting several times by an electrician. Because it stopped working every few hours. We had to move rooms 3 times, and the front of house staff not very accommodating at all. We basically had to beg for a room move every time. Leatichia on the front desk actually hanged-up on me when I called to speak to a manager (which is truly unbelievable how they treat their guests) It seems like this hotel mainly caters for functions, as they definitely do not care about families or individual guests. Unfortunately we pre-paid our stay (4 nights) so could not leave without having to loose all the money we've pre-paid. On the 3rd morning it was snowing and we thought to try out the hotel's restaurant for breakfast. We were served 2 juices for our children (3 and 6y) and 2 coffees without cream for the coffee.One of the staff members in the restaurant- Adriaan, came past and we asked him for cream, he told us to wait. then 20 minutes later (since the moment we sat down) I went to the service area where 3 staff members were all gathering. I asked for cream, and was told they are really busy. I told the server that the restaurant only had 5 tables and that there are 4 servers, so they can't be too busy. I was told by one of the servers that they are because they they are serving room service as well. 5 minutes later we just left, and had a very nice breakfast at the Blue spoon cafe on the corner. I constantly tried to speak to the General manager regarding our stay, during our stay.. but was every time told by the Front office staff, that he was not available. Mr. Cheung the General manager finally called me back at 4pm the day after we've checked out and didn't believe a word about our experience at his hotel. Not helpful at all!! I basically just wasted my time and money to try and tell him about our experience (for him to try and make it right or at least appologize ) This is the first General manager who didn't appologize, just blundly refused to help. Honestly once this hotel has your money, they do not care at all. The more functions/ groups they can get in and make some noise by playing loud music, the happier they are. If you are a family or individual, please get yourself a nice hotel where the staff care and your basic needs are met. Where you actually feel like a guest. This trip was arranged to visit a very sick Cancer patient in Memorial Sloan Kettering hospital in NY, and the first visit to NY for our children.

Room temp was fine although it was cold outside. TV worked fine and it had some HB and Showtime. Wifi worked fine. Coffee maker in room with coffee and tea, free bottle of water daily. Bed as very plush and comfortable. The location is excellent about a 5 minute walk to the Fulton Ave Station, although the Wall Street Station is a little easier (not as busy) if you can get by with access only to the 2 and 3 Lines. Small restaurants and coffee shops abound in the area as do fast food and donut shops. About a 10 minute walk at most to WTC Memorial and new Westfield OccuIus Shopping Center. Did not eat at the hotel restaurant and you get 15% discount. The fitness center looked brand new and barely used but it definitely is adequate for a quick workout. I found the staff pleasant and helpful, professional. Three elevators were quick and efficient.

After they tried to fix it, it was deemed broken. I was forced to pack back up, move and unpack again. Now its 1 am. The new room was smaller, with a desk my laptop barely fit on, the phone next to the bed was ""gone"". The sink was still wet which made me uneasy. Next DayI went to work but before I did, I stopped by the front desk to tell them about the night before and the fiasco. The managers response ""Uh Huh"". And he walked off.I came back that night and got trapped in the elevator with 6 people. All the buttons on the elevator stopped working. People in the elevator hysterical. I called the front desk and the response ""Uh Huh"".I was waiting for the next shoe to drop.Next DayI came back from work and the bed had been made but nothing else touched. There was crumbs on the desk next to my lap top. The bathroom had tooth paste in the sink.Next DayIt became necessary to turn on the heat. Predictably the thermostat was broken in the second room. . After a few trips up by maintenance (who inferred that this was the norm) , they told me to turn it up to 80 and it would be 73 degrees.The general manager sent me an email - this was the customer service I received from all of this headache. An email.I then emailed Sheraton and got an automated email from them.Still nothing.After the inconvenience suffered and $1200 spent, I would have hoped that there would have been some form of kind thought, show of concern, by the management or Sheraton except for an email.

The room has various charging ports in the desk and by the bed, which is nice for us with a lot of gadgets. On the weekends, I did not leave the room until 1 or 2 in the afternoon so they could not clean the room, and the staff left a note they I could request any items and I need, and after I left they cleaned the room anyway; that's what I call service.The fitness center was one of the best I've used in an NYC hotel -- newer model ellipticals and treadmills, lots of free weights, exercise balls, floor mats, etc. I had a couple of guest passes to a full-on gym and didn't end up using it because this had all I needed.There is no breakfast, but there are a couple of restaurants attached, one of which does serve breakfast (Ketch). There's also a family-style Italian restaurant (Harry's) in the same building where I ordered a pizza one night and it was tasty. All-in-all a wonderful stay and would recommend to anyone.

The room was clean, including the bathroom, and the linens crisp and fresh. Nice king-sized bed.The windows open slightly if you like fresh air. We had ours open all night and were not bothered by noise, however we were on the 26th floor so that may have made a difference. The air conditioning in the room was a little odd, it was set to 75 degrees and still blasted ice cold air at regular intervals. Some adjustments allowed us to just use the air from the open window to cool our room.Slightly odd setup with a ""half"" closet - if you hang your pants they fold up on the floor of the closet as below you'll find the room safe and a drawer.

It's an excellent location!! The hotel is an easy, interesting walk to Wall Street, South Street Seaport (bliss to sit on the pier on a hot day!) 9/11 Memorial, City Hall, Fulton Street subway, (with connections to everywhere, including train to JFK Airport) Staten Island Ferry, and some great, scenic MTA bus routes that will take you uptown, e.g. the M 3 bus.The hotel itself is fine and well-beyond adequate. I stayed in a corner room with queen sized bed, on 17th floor. The room was compact, but so well designed, I hardy thought of it as small. There are plenty of charging ports--on both sides of the bed. There is lighting on the headboard as well as on lamps and ceiling; a corner table (I used it for luggage) with almost hidden drawer in it; a desk; more seating should it be needed, tucked under the nightstands. Size-wise, only problem was the closet is too narrow for the hangers in it. The mgr said that was a problem in those corner rooms, so if you have large number of clothes to hang, ask for a room with a wide-enough closet.Coffee is available in lobby in the morning, or there is an in-room coffee maker. There are two free-use desktop computers in the lobbyAC was noisy as it cycled on--bring earplugs if you're a light sleeper.The outside phone line did not work the entire four days of my stay. This meant having to call the front desk from my mobile phone. Not a huge inconvenience, but hopefully an issue that is now resolved.There are nearby convenient places for food--e.g. Plaza Deli, Jubilee Market, if you don't want to eat out at restaurant. Attached to the hotel is a restaurant/brew pub, staffed with what may be the nicest greeting and wait crew in NYCStaff at the hotel are excellent. In particular, look for helpful, super friendly Alexander, and Michael, two of the nicest guys you'll ever meet in Manhattan! Lauren, the evening mgr, was helpful and eager to have the hotel experience be a good one. There is a very serious-demeanored security guard present as well.The only part of cleaning that could be improved is to have the hallway monitored better. Several times, there was paper trash on the carpet, and on the tables by the elevator--still there the next day. There room cleanliness was fine. Even the large windows-- facing the street from the 17th floor-- were spotless! I took the green"" option on two of four days, to not have maid-service.Directions: DO have a map of some kind with you as you arrive for the first tie (Once at hotel, they will give you a one .) There are lots of small streets in the area, and even some cab drivers don't know the small Platt Street. It parallels John Street (this may help you at some point--trust me!) Also, if you take the subway to arrive, know that Fulton Street Subway station. has several entrances/exits, and I got myself quite ""turned around"" following google maps' directions. You'll see the tall Freedom Tower (check a photo if it is your first time to NY) from just about anywhere. Know that it is on the West side of Manhattan. This helped me sort out ""uptown"" (north) and ""downtown"" (South) when getting directions to the hotel. Though i sound like a confused newbie...I was born and raised in NYC!

The best part of this hotel is its proximity to the train station (Fulton Street), shopping and the waterfront. There are also several nice restaurants right across the street. I went to two Italian restaurants and had some very good meals. I enjoyed the formality at these restaurants which is rare on the West Coast. The hotel was nice, beautiful room but it was very small. The closets do not accommodate long clothing such as gowns or pants that are not folded. I traveled alone and felt safe walking around the area, even at night as there are police around walking the beat. The staff were young and friendly. Everything was clean. The things I did not like were the view as a I had a large building in front of my window, the back of it faced me and it was solid concrete, you had to peek to the side and crane your neck up real high and down to see anything else. The air conditioner was on and it was a little cold. There was no heat but as it was warm outside it did not matter. I left the air conditioner off and it was fine. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was very nice and the shower was easy to use. The room is cleaned daily and you are provided with fresh linens if that is what you want. If not you leave a card on you door to ask them to skip your room for the day. There is no refrigerator or microwave but then again I did not see food stains anywhere so maybe this is a good thing. They do provide ice free of charge and it will stay frozen for several hours is you use the ice bucket with the cover. The area is a little pricey but you can save money by buying your own water and snacks. There is a nice sized pharmacy within walking distance and many things to see and experience by subway and walking. I was able to figure out the subway on my first try. Get a subway map from the front desk and buy a week pass if you plan to say more than a few days. The ticket machines are at the subway and they are very easy to use.

Very pleasant staff. Hotel very well located in downtown New York, away from noisy Times Square and within walking distance from the subway, Battery Park and everything else in downtown. Has free wifi (nowadays it is what you expect). However there are some gaps for improvement. First, I requested a room with a city view (they are more expensive than standard rooms) and all I could see was 3 blocks of concrete and no city. This is not a city view. The hotel should specify this kind of rooms all it means is upper storey rooms, but nothing else (as one member of the staff told me). Second, the air conditioning is unbelievable noisy and not ideal to have that noise when asleep. Third, one day I returned to the hotel as late as 11pm to find that my room had not been serviced. I reported this to reception and the answer I got was that there wasn't any housekeeping at that time. This is not the kind of answer I expect from a hotel that charges 230 dollars per night and that does not include breakfast. It was not pleasant having to tidy the room myself, when all I wanted and needed was a shower and go to bed. Also, my bed wasn't nicely made every day; it looked somebody had rushed making it, putting the cover over the bed but the bottom sheet was not smooth and uncreased. Last, the last night I stayed was charged more expensive than the others, but when I booked the hotel, that was not specified. Overall, I don't recommend this hotel. Whereas the location is excellent (according to what I was looking for), there are other points to consider and I'm not impressed at all.","Guildford, United Kingdom","Marina C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guildford, United Kingdom</strong>",9,3.0

New! Extremely clean and comfortable. Well designed rooms. The neighborhood offers a wealth of excellent restaurants. Great hotel service and very professional staff. One thing however-- The hotel restaurant needs to better communicate with front desk: it took several attempts to redeem pre-paid breakfast coupon, and restaurant tried to charge $6.00 for coffee included with American Breakfast per the menu description. Restaurant management was disappointing and doesn't reflect outstanding hotel management and service. Highly recommend this hotel.","Albany, New York","Upstate2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albany, New York</strong>",15,5.0

They go out of their way to help! 24 hours... Very friendly staff. On top of my list when I am in the area. I have forgotten my toiletries, they brought it to my door. We were working late night, and the room was tight to fit in two chairs and computers, they moved us into a larger room without us asking. They knew the area and gave us great recommendations.
