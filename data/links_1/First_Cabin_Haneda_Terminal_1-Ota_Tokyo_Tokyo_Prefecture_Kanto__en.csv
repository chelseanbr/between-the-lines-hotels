On the bus trip I found this gem of a place to stay. Very affordable, spoke English, super clean, showers and spa available with your room rental. I couldn't be more happy with my experience. Almost worth the price just to leave your bags somewhere for a few hours. If you get in after all the restaurants close you may still purchase food and even beer in their vending machines. It is set up kind of strange where you get your own cube, and you are only separated from other patrons by a vinyl door, but everyone is very respectful and quiet (I felt bad making noise by zipping up my bag).They provide you with everything neccessary for the shower/spa to include, toothbrush and paste, towels and washcloths, pajamas and slippers. The showers are individual, but the spa and dressing areas are open (like a locker room). This isn't really an issue as everyone keeps to themselves as they're getting ready.Hands down I would stay here again! For ¥6800 you just cant do better. And the best part is it's in the terminal so you don't need to rush to get to the airport.",,Wearytraveler6941,1,5.0

It was going to be very expensive to get into Tokyo at 2/2.30am (there are several flights arriving at once) so we chose to book in at First Cabin Haneda as the only way to Tokyo was taxi and then paying full nights accommodation. I found their website a little difficult to book on but an email straight to them sorted a booking immediately. You need to get to Terminal 1 (domestic) after arriving on an international flight but the taxi concierge spoke perfect English and organised the trip for us on the spot. The taxi driver even waited after we rang the after hours bell to ensure we got in okay. Once in we were given keys to immaculately clean ‘pod’ style rooms (men one side of reception, women the other). Rooms were equipped with pyjamas (I’m a size 16 and they fitted comfortably) towels, slippers, tissues, dimmable lights, air conditioning, headphones for TV, toothbrush & paste, hanging space, safe and beautifully clean and crisp white bedding. The shared bathroom is equipped with face cleanser, hair dryers, soap, moisturiser, all in a very clean space with showers and seated areas in front of well lit mirrors. It is a very respectful, quiet area and even though the pods around you are all occupied it is very peaceful and relaxed.You can stay until 10am and there is a lounge with comfortable seating and refreshments if you need to stay longer. There is of course free wifi.We loved the experience as our first taste of Japan and it’s wonderful uniqueness. Highly recommended as a late flight arrival option.","Adelaide, Australia","Liz T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",10,5.0

It was thoughtful and super great and I hope more and more travellers know about that;) They better put it on the website as well!How surprised that they equipped with a hot spa! Though I’m not sure if it is a onsen but it was great to have it before leaving Japan! I’ll check in earlier if I know they have it in advance!The only thing made my stay imperfect, the cabin was too hot.

Do not expect the comfort and/or luxuries of a hotel. This is a capsule hotel in the airport. It is convenient, and that is why we booked it (early flight the next morning). Amenities were fabulous - hair dryers, hair straighteners, hair curlers. Shiseido branded toiletries, and plenty of them. Lots of space to do your hair/makeup. Provided PJs, slippers, towels. Everything you need for a short stay. Staff were helpful and friendly and stored our bigger luggage while we kept our smaller bags with us, which we could lock away in our capsules. Beds were hard but no harder than the other hotels we stayed at in the other Japanese cities. The only downside is the noise. Indeed, as others have mentioned, you can hear everything. Someone near us was snoring most of the night and there is little to no sound barrier. Earplugs are available at the front desk but in the middle of the night the last thing you want to do is trek out there, half asleep. Would stay here again for a night before a flight.","Vancouver, Canada","Nicole Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",10,4.0

The small one is basically a twin bed without that extra floor space. There are no USB outlets, so bring your own adapters.

This was my first experience in a pod type hotel. Easy to find in Terminal 1 (Domestic) well signposted with a well organised check-in.Very different from a normal hotel as you are effectively in a small pod - there are 2 types a business class pod which is the width of a queen size bed (wall to wall) a TV, small shelf small locker & a roller door NOTE there are no locks on the door! I had the first class pod which is a bit larger with a queen size bed a small table and 3 feet of space between th the bed & the wall Large TV (in Japanese) small locker under the bed.

The cabins, under the Japanese law, cannot be locked as the place was not categorised as a hotel.Nevertheless, this was actually a very good place to rest and re-organize. I had about 6 hours to spare before catching my flight at 1.30 am. All the amenities are shared here but they were kept spick and span. There was a hot spring pool, shower rooms, toilets, spacious wash basin for personal grooming (I am not sure about the women's side as they are separated) and even a set of washing machine &dryer. Towels and toiletries were all provided for, plus a set of T-shirt and pants to change into.The place is located right inside Haneda Terminal 1. There were plenty of restaurants, eateries, bakeries and shops to meet our needs. Also, one just need to go to Gate 8 (just outside the entrance to First Cabin) to hop onto the free shuttle to the international terminal, or terminal 2.The room could not be locked but only a louvre to latch onto (again, requirement of Japanese law) but, for the bigger room, there is a big drawer under the bed which could be locked. One can just store the valuables inside. Anyway, the place was secured and I would say it was fairly safe.

After a sleepless flight (nope, I really can't sleep on a plane), I really have no wish to go wander the streets of Tokyo, but instead prefer some sleep. First Cabin is ideal for that. It's a capsule hotel, don't expect a full blown hotel experience. As I'm sleeping there on a somewhat strange hour (while all others are leaving), there is a bit more movement in the corridors between the capsules, still a good sleep is perfectly possible. The mattress is a bit hard. For me that's perfect, but be warned. There's showers and a spa, amenities are made available. Perfect, actually, though I must say the hygiene could be a bit better. For Japanese standards, the maintenance is a bit sub-optimal. But it's small details only, like for instance dust nests on the rack with baskets next to the shower.

The bus drops you off at the main entrance that is closest to the hotel entrance inside the terminal building.Checkin was smooth and finding the cabin was easy, in effect it's a large hall with cabins slotted in to build a structure in the room.You can't talk in the room, set your alarm, play music or watch TV out loud, you must use headphones and if you want to be woke then you can let reception know and they will wake you.When I got to my first class cabin ( almost double the size of a standard cabin) it looked clean, if not a little dusty. I had a bed side table, TV, pillow and booster pillow/cushion along with a small blanket, not big enough to cover the whole length of the bed.I decided to try the Spa (communal bath) it is open for 21 hours a day, closing at 9.30am for cleaning and sadly it seems that this is the only time it gets cleaned. The floor between the Onsen and the showers was so slime that we found we had to wash the floor so we would not slip on it, we then had to use the separate private showers to wash our feet after.The private shower area has carpet, so this is also nasty given everyone walks on it when wet.After the slime experience it was time for bed, I was looking forward to it but the bed was rock hard, cover thin and not big enough to cover me and it was so cold. I between all of this you could hear other people opening the sliding divider, walking up and down and of course opening suitcases to throw things around it and make as much racket as they could looking for things.Altogether this was not a great experience and I would suggest that if you are a party of 2 or more and are coming in from the international terminal then you should just book into a real hotel that is cleaned more often. Such a shame this place don't do a better job of checking people in and out to allow others to get a better nights sleep and also a shame that cleaning of the spa is only done once a day as this is simply not enough to keep it clean. This was a bit surprise given the high standards in Japan. ",London,"Terraprime</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",34,2.0

The room has a non-locking curtain and a high level of respectful quiet is expected (unlike Euro hostels). The bathrooms have bidets to wash your private parts, and there are shower stalls for those too shy to use the onsen. Big mistake! The onsen is a typical sex segregated all nude shower on a small seat preceding a large communal hot bath. Quiet nice! I recommend both shower and onsen wash just for the experience and fun of being in Japan.They track the loaner clothing called ""cabin wear"" although I wasn't offered any, perhaps due to my gaijin size or short stay. They have a luggage storage area for customers so I'm not sure what the other reviewer was complaining about: I used it while I went to lunch and was issued a luggage check card. I suspect it may have been due to the language barrier, so be prepared to patiently and politely run your requests through Google translate (or an understanding fellow patron) for a good experience.

Nevermind the shoebox size room, that's not the point in staying here... Its the experience!!! Japanese hospitality at its best! It's located in the 1F domestic terminal of Haneda Airport... 7 mins by bus to the international terminal. It's so unique in its concept that you'll only find in Japan. This is ideal for solo travelers or group of friends or families without small children. Not for honeymooners lol!!! Check in was smooth... The explanation brief and concise. One thing about Japan that I learned was that most extras are free like plug adapters, earplugs, fast pass/fast track at Disneysea. They provided it free of charge. I would highly recommend the First Class.. It's an extra JPY1000 or £6.00 than the business class. You get the extra space which I'm sure you'll totally appreciate. Men and women are separate areas. But the lounge area where you can eat, talk, smoke is mix, but there's also a women only lounge. Don't ask me why that's the case but that's the way it is :-), besides there's no talking in the sleeping/cabin area. I was given a card to swipe or tap to enter the women's area then a locker key. The cabins: the first class cabin is very functional. It has a table, a locker or a drawer with a lock, dim lighting and a huge tv for a small room, I think it's a 37in tv lol! I was provided with knee length shorts and a shirt, a bath & a hand towel, wash cloth, toothbrush/paste, slippers. I was wondering at the lounge earlier when I'm having my fag and drink why was some wearing the same clothes... I thought they're a group of students... But it was the clothes provided so we be comfortable... Now the spa/ bathrooms / vanity / toilets... The bathroom comprises of a shower cubicle with the strongest water pressure ever hahaha.. The shampoo, conditioner, shower gels and facial soap are all SHISEIDO. Like very impressive! There's a basket rack outside the shower to put your stuff in. The spa has this sort of wading pool, we're you can relax... Water is heated. The vanity area... Huge mirrors, chairs and stools, facial creams, handsoaps lotions ( they have this unique clear watery lotion ... I'll try to find it next time I visit Japan ) again all by shisheido. They have hair dryer per table, curling / straightening irons etc. The toilet... Is a separate area and you need to use the toilet slippers inside... Cleanest people ever!Lounge is a nice cozy place with a long table and chairs for eating, sofas and lounge chairs for relaxing, books, newspapers, magazines and bar stools. It has different vending machines for drinks and hot food. A smoking area. Charging area... A washer and dryer is also provided but requires coins. If you got lots of luggage, they store it for you. No extra cost of course. Restaurants outside the hotel abs inside the domestic terminal building closes at 23.00H. They provide wake up call as no one is allowed to have alarms inside the sleeping area. So enjoy and explore their website... And when you book, they don't ask for credit card info ..

Since we had an early flight the next morning, she booked us into the First Cabin Luxury Capsule hotel at Haneda Airport. These were not what you would imagine a capsule hotel to be, crawling into a 4x4x8ft capsule and sleeping. These were essentially a tiny room with sliding doors (with a gap at the bottom and top). The economy ones ~$50 had the width of the bed of the entire room, while the luxury capsules, ~$60 were slightly wider with a space to walk into your room and to place your luggage on the floor. I stayed in the luxury capsule as we thought it would be easier if one of us had the luggage for the night. The rooms are pretty bare boned as was expected, but they serve its purpose. There were also pajamas provided for you; mine were a bit small on me, sized medium for 5’10” 163lb. There was also a very nice locker styled bathroom with multiple sinks with beauty lights, several nice showers and even a spa room that I did not use. As for my night, I unfortunately did not get much sleep. Due to the design of the rooms, they are sliding doors without a lock and a air gap at the top and bottom of the sliding door which allows hallway noise and light, as well as nose from your neighbors to seep in very noticeably. I had the unfortunately luck of having someone near my room be a very loud snorer, and it kept me up all night. Overall, the facilities were nice, and the rooms were cheap. Unfortunately, if you are a light sleeper, you may want to reconsider as it’s a luck of the draw if you’re there the same time as someone who snores, otherwise if you are a heavier sleeper or can wear earplugs, this might be an option you would want to consider.",,byip12,17,4.0

They're located Domestic Terminal 1, Arrivals floor bus stop 8!!!Unfortunately our driver did try to ditch us at departure floor, we refused to get off as everything is locked! Unlucky for us a taxi journey which is supposed to be between ¥1200-1500, cost us ¥3000! You will see the board that says First Cabin Haneda, just ring the door bell and wait for member of staff to come and get you as everything is locked.Try to be prepared before you go in and take everything out of your suitcase! Everyone there are super tired so be considerate as you can even hear a penny drop!On your ID card and wrist band there's your locker key underneath the bed that you can stow all your valuables. In the room there's already slippers, PJ, toothbrush, towel, maybe remember to get ear plugs when you first check in! Also if you need travellers plug, ask them to borrow one, as they wouldn't allow to use your own.Use their lounge area to unpack the stuff you need in your suitcase, in there there's two vending machines for drinks and snacks, massage chair, charger point. By the time I'm ready to get washed, was about 2:30-3am, at that time, no one is in the bathroom! Just get washed when you arrive to avoid rush hour in the morning! They got shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash, toner, ALL by Shisheido =) they even got a hair straightener to use! Super impressed!!!!If you're shy, but still want to use the hot spring bath, go in at the unsociable hours like me as you have to be completely naked. Remember to bath yourself before you jump in!There's free wifi, code is behind your ID card, can be used anywhere even inside your capsule! Good speed too! :)I asked for wake up call, as they wouldn't allow you to use your phone in the cabin, poor lady must have stood on the door for like a good 3-4min! She just quietly call you, but would not step into your room or touch you. Yepp! I was knocked out, had a fantastic sleep and stay =) Don't think!

We picked the 'First Class' cabins which were more spacious than the 'Business Class' cabins. The good:1) Communal shared shower stalls are offered or you could choose the usual sento arrangement of showering with everyone and enjoying the hot bath, which I did. A nice touch for a capsule hotel. In the vanity area, there were enough sinks, hairdryers and facial products for use. I could be wrong but I think this is standard for Japanese hospitality establishments - whether hostel or hotel. Still, this was something I appreciate. 2) We were told phones had to be set to silent or vibrate mode to avoid disturbing our neighbours. But despite that, not everyone adhered to the rule. I was awakened at 4am with an incessant ring tone from someone's phone several cabins down the corridor. Noise was definitely an issue. Because of the hollow fibreglass structure of the cabins, every close of a drawer or movement of bags could be felt/heard. Even if people spoke in whispers, you could hear. As such it was not easy to get a good night's sleep. Well between a night on a bench in the airport and the capsule hotel, I guess I'm glad I have the capsule hotel. For those who just want to tick off yet another box in the checklist of quintessential Japanese experiences, this is a novel experience and probably similarly comfortable as a hostel but now that I've BTDT, I wouldn't do it again.",Singapore,"chongbrood</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",146,3.0

And the doors let in a lot of light - it's much better if you have an eye mask.

First Cabin is essentially an enlarged capsule hotel, with the convenience of an onsite airport location. It was about ¥5000/night. Just to be safe, find their website and make a reservation before you arrive. Upon arrival at the airport, it's not immediately easy to find FC, so check with the Information Desk; you may need to take a free terminal bus to the correct location. You'll arrive at a small, lobby-like area with a check-in desk, where you can leave your larger suitcases. Adjacent to this area is a large lounge with vending machines, TVs, free wifi, and power outlets. Good place to hang if you need to kill some time or send emails.After check-in, you proceed to the gender-separated lodgings, which reminded me of a long-term storage facility. The capsules are large enough to accommodate a full-size bed -- and some small suitcases -- just within the threshold of the pull-down barrier. The barriers do not lock, as with most capsule hotels, so leave valuables with the front desk. The capsules are tall enough that I can stand upright inside them (I'm 5'10""/1.78meter). It was surprisingly quiet, the only sound being other guests quietly shuffling around. Bathrooms and showers are in a separate area. Everything was clean,and all basic amenities -- toothpaste, toothbrush, razors, towels, hairdryer, etc -- were provided. The capsules have good wi-fi, a TV, and Radio.The whole experience was easy, clean, convenient, and great value.

I had not been to Japan, and let me tell you, the rumors are true, it's fricken expensive. I wanted a place within the airport where I could lie down and stash my luggage, and this was definitely the cheapest option, even compared to going to a capsule hotel outside the airport by the time you pay for transport etc. Day time bookings are available from 10am to 7pm and the cost is 800yen per hour for a business cabin and 1000yen per hour for a first class cabin. There's a free shuttle between terminals, so if you come on an international flight you must check out and take the shuttle to terminal 1 and it's on floor 1F, very easy to find and accessible to lots of delicious food courts and shopping. Food is not included, thee are a couple of snack machines but nothing very appetising.All the photos on the website are accurate, and the only difference between the two is that the first class has some floor space next to the bed, good if you want to take your luggage in with you. I left all my big luggage at reception and just took my small backpack into a business cabin and slept with it on the bed.The room has Japanese channels only, but has really good high speed free wifi which can stream off. The bed is wide, but very hard, I like a firm mattress but this one was one of the firmest I've slept on, this may not be comfortable for some people.The highlight was the shared bathroom with the hot pool. I have to admit I was totally ignorant to Japanese bathing culture and had no idea what to do, so for those in the same boat, you undress to naked in the changing area where the baskets are, and you go naked into the shared bathroom, where you take a seated shower in front of the mirror. Once you've finished showering/washing your etc then you can just hop into the hot tub, which is so amazing and really lovely and hot, none of this lukewarm business! I ended up going back for another one before I checked out. There is shampoo, conditioner, body wash, face wash, body lotion all supplied and all by shiseido (or at least that's what the bottles say).The staff wee extremely friendly and helpful and I have to say I would definitely stay there again. Only thing to bear in mind is that the roomss are single occupancy only, and men and women have separate areas, so if you're travelling in a couple you will not be staying together, you can only meet up in the shared lounge.(Or maybe that sounds appealing to you heh heh)","Auckland, New Zealand","LaydeeLala</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",13,5.0

I arrived at Narita airport around 5pm on a Friday but had a flight the next morning at 6:20AM from Haneda to Ishigaki. After landing and getting my luggage and cell phone rental at Narita airport, I took the limousine bus from Narita to Haneda and checked in around 8:30pm. The ride was around 1-1.5 hrs. 1) Late arrival - I was surprised that when checking in the hotel was pretty empty at around 8:30, but the place got busier later in the night with new arrivals. After checking in, there were still some restaurants open until 10pm in terminal 1 so we were able to have a decent dinner, and there's a convenience store available as well. 2) Check in was straightforward. I can speak Japanese and also happen to look Japanese so I couldn't get a good sense of the English capabilities of the front desk staff as they continued to speak to me in Japanese even though I was speaking to my brother in English. You will get a copy of a map of the layout, instructions in English about the policies and also a cute illustrated instruction in English, Chinese and Korean on using the bathing area (i.e. you need to clean your body first before entering the bath). 3) You will receive a pass to get into the male and female cabin areas (separate entries for males and females) as well as a key for a big drawer under the bed if you opted for the first class cabin. For the smaller room, the drawer may be smaller. For me, I was able to unload some items I needed from my suitcase for the night and shove my carry on bag in there to lock it up. They can store large suitcases for you at the front desk if you are not comfortable leaving your suitcase outside of your cabin. You will be supplied headphones for watching tv. They will also ask you if you plan to charge anything. If so, they will give you an adapter to plug in your device to the electrical outlet. 4) If you are traveling with a member of the opposite sex the only area you can hang out together is a lounge area in the lobby due to the separate accommodations. I didn't mind since at most I would be there 8 hours, the majority of which would be spent sleeping or bathing. 5) A big draw for me was the bathing area. After a long flight from New York via Chicago, it was fantastic to be able to scrub the airplane ickiness off of me and soak in the tub. The ladies area has around 7 stations to clean yourself and the actual hot water tub can fit around 8 people in there. The ladies room has shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, facial soap and lotions, q-tips, cotton squares, etc... They also supply you with optional shorts and shirt you can use for pajamas or lounging around, towels and toothbrush.6) Wake-up call: Someone will come wake you up for a wake up call as you are not supposed to use an audible alarm clock. I was a little paranoid about that but if you are able to set your cell phone on vibrate it's a good back-up.7) As a tip for the mens side, I asked that if possible they put my brother somewhere away from others since he is a loud snorer. They gave him a cabin (S15) which is in a corner and according to the map is not directly adjacent to another cabin. However, it's next to where people throw away their garbage and also along a path of a lot of foot traffic so apparently it was pretty loud for him with the noise from other people throughout the night.8) Convenience for morning flight - We took an inter-terminal bus to terminal 2 that took around 5-7 minutes from terminal 1 and ended up there around 5:30am. After passing security, it appeared that nothing was open until 6am including a Starbucks. There might be something open earlier than that before the security check point.9) If you are really particular about your mattress, the one I slept on was pretty hard which is my preference, but I am sure that that can be uncomfortable for anyone who needs a soft bed.10) I recommend if you are willing to spend a little extra, pay for a first class cabin. Having that little extra space is nice, especially after spending a long flight packed like sardines in economy class. For the cost, convenience and novelty, I recommend staying at First Cabin. If you know you are a light sleeper and the communal atmosphere doesn't appeal to you, then you are better off booking a hotel room near Haneda airport instead or at Terminal 2 (Tokyu Excel). The best way I can describe the experience is that it is like staying at a hip, upscale youth hostel with a bunch of well-behaved adults.",New York,"Lisa S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",39,4.0

(10:00am-12:00pm everyday is cleaning time)For a short rest, this is much better option rather than paying airport lounge facility near by.I booked to stay again in a week's time due to fly back to London the following morning.Again I chose to stay at First class rather than Business class as I had a big luggage and wanted to keep beside me. To stay this place as comfortable as possible, here's my tips (especially to travellers awaiting for a long haul flight following morning) :1. I requested to have a furthest end cabin which is the quietest section of all and the best choice if you want to have a decent rest. Staff were very obliging to accept my request.2. First class is the way to go if you are claustrophobic, it's more like a room. Also, If you want to keep your luggage, there's enough room to manoeuvre. If you are paranoid about security, bring a coiled bicycle lock like I did. You can tie your suitcase around bedside table leg. ( I did not have to use it as I felt safe enough and there is a lockable compartment under the bed)3. Alarm clock and mobile phone are not supposed to use in the cabin, but for example, if you want to wake up at 4:30am, request for a wake up call (this is manually done by staff) at 4:00 or 4:15 am at the reception(you have to fill a form upon check in), but you should put alarm clock at 4:30am for a peace of mind & just in case.On my first stay, I requested for a wake up call at 11:00am but staff forgot about it and eventually she came to me apologetically at 11:45am!( luckily, I was awake).Human error occurs and your airplane is not going to wait for you.4. Corporate to keep noise minimum for fellow exhausted travellers.Try to separate essential item for the stay(make up, clothes etc,) in a small bag,there is a changing room adjacent to female lounge.5. Give yourself time to have a bath and sit in the massage chair (100yen for 10 mins) before going to bed, it really relaxes you and be able to sleep nicely. Earplug(you can get at reception) and eye mask help,too.6. Most of the restaurants at terminal 1 close by 21:30 pm. Convenience store near by closes around 23:00pm.7. Bus stop (to and from International terminal) locates diagonally opposite to First Cabin Haneda on the same floor. Bus comes and goes every 5mins from early morning.Give yourself 15-20mins is enough time from check out to arrival of international terminal.Overall, it was very comfortable,convenient, clean & cost effective place to stay(for Tokyo) but you need to prepare yourself, you are not staying at conventional hotel. I did quite enjoy semi communal living arrangement! I felt very safe surrounded by likeminded travellers of all ages & the atmosphere was very relaxed.Will stay again when I fly to Haneda.","London, United Kingdom","Mollymalone38</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",20,4.0

After rolling up the 'garage door' style opening of your room, you see just how tight it's going to be. Then you dive in (there isn't any floor space - just the bed) and make the most of it.The hotel is about an 8 minute ride on the free airport shuttle from the International Terminal to Terminal 1. Just inside the drop off entrance, turn right diagonally and proceed to the 2nd hallway. Take the escalator up and you're there. There is adequate signage and the first impression is a good one - modern, clean and inviting. In addition to the front desk, there is a common room with tables and chairs, free WIFI, snack machines and 2 fee PCs. To the left of the front desk is the entrance to the women's only sleeping area; men's to the right. The women's area also has a private lounge area.Inside the capsule is a built-in lockable (they give you a key upon check-in) security box measuring 8""w x 30""l x 16""h. Also provided are disposable slippers, toothbrush and toothpaste, TV remote control, headphone jack, 2 electrical outlets and light switch. Sleepwear (top and bottom - one size fits - or doesn't - all) is provided and everyone walking around was wearing it. Like the hotel itself, it was comfortable. The shared bathroom has several sinks and hair dryers. There is a separate room with the toilets as well as a Japanese style bathing area. The showers had good temperature and pressure as well as liquid soap, shampoo and conditioner.Overall this was a very positive experience. The front desk will hold luggage you don't want to keep in your unsecured capsule, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The bed was adequate for the night, the price reasonable and everything was clean and well kept.I recommend this as a great stay if you arrive late or are making connections the next day.

First Cabin is a pod style accommodation with individual pods that have a slide down shutter for a door that does not lock, nor does it close 100%.The above is not intended to put anyone off, if you are interested in experiencing a pod, or capsule style hotel, please read on.We decided to stay at First Cabin after arriving on a late flight into Haneda. There is a free shuttle that goes between the International Terminal and Domestic Terminal 2 and then 1 which is where First Cabin is located.The bus was easy to find at the International Terminal (after exiting into airport, just follow the signs for the bus terminal), and my only concern was that Terminal 1 does close down after the last flight, but lucky for us the terminal was still open, and a quick question to a security guard showed that First Cabin was not far from the entrance inside the Terminal where the bus stop was.Check-in was easy. Males and females are of course segregated. You can leave your luggage (if it is large) just outside your pod, or if you are paranoid sleep next to it. We had booked the Business Class, which is smaller than the First Class pods. They are fitted out with a flatscreen television, a couple of hangers, clean sheets and a pillow, and small lockbox. You also get all the extras that you would get at any standard hotel, pyjamas, slippers, towels, toothbrush etc.The communal area is honestly better than what you would get in some average hotels. A small onsen, two single showers, a vanity area containing, cotton tips, hairdryers, mirrors, moisturisers etc. The showers had Shiseido shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Now, I know this is a standard brand for Japan, but for foreigners, it's a luxury.Inside the lobby there is a lounge area that has a few vending machines, and free wifi. The whole place was relaxed and clean.I am normally a restless sleeper, but in this instance I was exhausted and did not hear a thing. During this stay, it didn't seem like First Cabin was booked out, so access to amenties wasn't an issue. Overall I was quite pleased. I don't think it's the cheapest accommodation, but it certainly didn't disappoint.A good way to experience a pod hotel, even if it is not quite like the capsule hotels in the city, but newer and possibly much cleaner.Side note: the hotel felt quite safe and other travellers are polite and conscious of the noise.",Melbourne,"Aernas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",17,4.0

I got off at the wrong terminal at the airport and a nice police officer took me all the way to the First Cabin front desk. They were very hospitable and had me checked-in very fast. They gave me a key to an already occupied cabin, however, so it was awkward opening up the shade and finding someone resting peacefully (oops). I went back to front desk and they apologized, but it was not that big of a deal to me. I got the larger cabin where you can actually walk in it. The smallest cabin has the bed right at the door when you open it...VERY SMALL. The next morning I was ready to check out and needed to purchase my bus ticket, but I had some trouble with using my visa. One of the receptionists helped me go to the bus ticket counter to purchase a ticket which took my card. I was very thankful for that as I was not prepared and tired because I didn't even sleep that night. Overall, it is a wonderful place to stay . It had just opened when I went so it was new.

This hotel has another bad review on a Japanese website (rakuten) about the same issue, I am assuming the same person was rude to them as well. It is just surprising to see that kind of service in Japan, especially at the airport (first point of Japan). Otherwise, the rooms and facilities were very very clean. I arrived after 12 am and besides the fact the bed was comfortable (capsule room) that I was extremely nervous not to make any noise. It costs over $50 to sleep for just 4-5 hours (you can't sleep right away due to being nervous and also need to get situated to sleep trying to maneuver around in a very small space without making noise). I am not sure I would use it next time since I could easily have slept at the airport (I saw many people sleeping on chairs). I rather spend $50 somewhere else. There is a shower room you can use at around $10 at the airport (not sure about hours). I recommend to just to use that and stay at the airport instead of paying $50 (plus taxi fair of $13 to get there - bus service stops after 11:45pm or so). I paid over $100 since I have more than one person in my party. I was not happy when the front lady (same lady who checked us in) didn't say ""thank you"" or anything when we left. She knew I was leaving but went on doing her chores, ignoring us.The good customer service goes a long way.

If you arrive from other terminals, watch out for the last shuttle bus that will take you to terminal one where First Cabin is. Terminal one is not 24hrs and will be closed shortly after midnight. The shuttle bus drops you directly in front of the small 'door' of First Cabin where there is an intercom for you to call for the First Cabin staff to open the door for you. But we reached before the terminal closed, so we didn't have to make use of that.It does seem like a maze at first as eveything was painted black and the doors looked the same. Everything was on the same floor. But there are enough signages to bring you to where you want. And of course, the male and female are separated. There's a cloth roller blind to close every cabin but it doesn't close fully to the floor. Rows of cabin faces each other and it's not sound proof.

You do not get as good sleep as people keep coming in and out throughout the night but it is really convenient to be able to get a few hours of sleep/rest before an early flight. They provide you with pijamas, two towels, slippers and a toothbrush and toothpaste. You hardly had to open your luggage!

It was a bit pricey but we were glad we booked it - we really rested well and was full of energy for the next day's itinerary.The capsule rooms were small but cosy although a bit hot for me as I couldn't find a switch for the aircond haha. The bed was comfortable enough but would pose a problem if you are claustrophobic. You don't have much space for luggage but you have the option of 1) leaving your luggage with the front desk; or 2) bringing it with you and placing it outside your capsule. Btw, you won't be able to lock your 'room' but you will be given a kep for a small locker for valuables. They also provide you with comfy cabin wear and slippers and toiletries, so basically you have pretty much everything needed for a night. There is a public bath area (there is a tub in there but you will have to strip), 2 shower rooms (ladies; I don't know about the guys) and a spacious and wonderful make up area!! Oh, and of course, toilets. They provide you with everything! - shampoo, conditioner, body wash, facial wash, curlers, hairdryers, huge mirrors with great lighting - obviously you can see why I love it and it is obivous Japanese people take much care of how they look. :) You also find a vending machine for body creams in the ladies' lounge! But bear in mind that you have to be very quiet once inside the room areas.They have wonderful vending machines - even more so for our very first night in Japan - drinks, body creams, even frozen food! So you can have your midnight snack anytime you want to. Then there is a comfortable lounge for you to eat and hang out - this is next to the front desk, so if you are going with the opposite sex, this is the place for you to meet. There is also wifi throughout, so no worries about getting disconnected.All in all, we really enjoyed the experience and are really greateful for a good night's sleep, even more so after seeing people sleeping on the airport chairs. We paid RM170 per pax and do bear in mind that it is located outside the international terminal, so you'll have to hop on the free shuttle bus for a short ride to the terminal 1 Would definitely be back! :) I love Japan!","Miri, Sarawak, Malaysia","EmmC48</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miri, Sarawak, Malaysia</strong>",36,5.0

Divided into men and women areas, once inside I was pleasantly surprised to find a modern clean space with rows of cabins. My cabin Y08 had a double bed, small table and 32' flat screen TV. On the bed towels are folded, headphones for watching TV (so you don't disturb others), a dental kit, and branded pajamas to wear. Even a special adapter is supplied for charging your electronics as others are strictly prohibited due to fire regulations. There is also a safety box for storing valuables under your bed since cabins do not have a door and do not lock for safety reasons, instead pulling on the vertical shutters ensures your privacy.Extra facilities include PC stations, battery charger for mobiles and laptops, lounge with a separate smoking room, vending machines that offer soft drinks, alcohol, snacks, bread and even noodles. A self-service laundry, bathhouse, showers, and a coin operated massage chair which I especially enjoyed in the spa area.First Cabin is a well thought out experience and am very impressed by its function and facilities, a great value stay with all the amenities of a hotel, in a cabin style room conveniently located within the airport terminal.***Note: First Cabin is located in Terminal 1 of Tokyo Haneda Airport, not Terminal I (i) the international terminal.

Checked in at 2030h and checkout by 0500h (flight at 0655h). Very efficient concept of sleeping quarters with a sliding privacy shade. They segregate by gender, possibly because of the open locker room style washrooms. Staff very shy to use English; however, they are more comfortable speaking Mandarin and Korean. Best compartments are adjacent to the larger rooms (I was in W6) because they are further away from the high traffic areas towards the washrooms/exit. Ventillation was sub-par. The lightbulb emits a lot of heat that is not dissipated fast enough. The privacy shade does not close all the way, leaving a gap for air to flow into cabin. If you have smelly shoes, please be courteous enough to enclose them in a plastic bag. The odors seep into cabins easily. The washroom is a typical Japanese style locker room. Be sure you're thoroughly washed and rinsed clean before entering the soaking tub. Very few food options at the airport terminal by 2100h. Be sure you have your own beverage (vending machine not cheap). OBTW, the provide pajamas... sadly, not the cotton kind that will absorb sweat easily.

There are separate areas for men and women. The business class rooms are small and completely occupied by the bed with no space for luggage, which they took care of at the reception. There's no actual door, just a sliding screen that can't be locked. Because of that, it was quite noisy, but the bed was comfy enough for me to get some shuteye.

The rooms are small but what you would imagine a first class room in an aeroplane might look like. Think of it as a bridge between a capsule hotel and a regular Japanese hotel room (which are also small).The hotel itself is located in DOMESTIC terminal 1. I arrived at international terminal 1 and thought it would be easy to find but actually, I was in the completely wrong place. Though it's easy to take the terminal bus, which runs from about 4am in the morning.Men and women are separated so if you are a couple or family, you'd have to split up! Though I think this hotel is mainly for salarymen or those who arrive early/depart early, like I did.There are two types of stays:Overnight stays, which you can reserve in advance, checking in from 7pm.Day rooms, from a minimum of 2 hours. Just walk in and check for free rooms.I used a day room for 3 hours as my flight arrived at 5am and I wanted to shower after my 12 hour flight and perhaps get some shuteye.On my departure, I had a 6am flight and transport from Tokyo to Haneda is a little difficult at 4am. So rather than risk anything, this is a relatively cheap alternative to booking a proper hotel nearby. The added convenience is this hotel is directly in the terminal!There are also two types of rooms:First class: I stayed in this, which fits a bed and has some floor space for your suitcase.Business class: Literally, the room fits the bed and that's it. So if you have a big suitcase, I don't think you'll be able to fit it in. I recommend booking the first class cabin which doesn't cost that much more.On checkin, the staff spoke some English and you fill in a form and let them copy your passport as usual. They show you to your cabin and point you in the direction of any facilities. They give you an entrance card, which gives you access to the room area and a key which is your locker key.First Class cabin: There's a TV and they provide headphones so you don't disturb other guests. Under the bed is a lockable draw, which you could fit a small backpack into plus any other valuables. They supply some pyjamas (shorts/T-shirt), slippers, towels and a toothbrush. That's about it. There is no door. Rather, it's a sliding screen which is not lockable. Magnetic latches close the shutter and stop it faffing about. There's a small gap (approx 20cm) under and above the screen so you can see people walking by and hear any noises. Because it's basically open, you can hear people zipping their suitcases or dropping things. Annoyingly, people will have different flights to catch and hence, you'll probably hear alarms going off throughout the morning. There's not much you can do about it really except use some earplugs or listen to your ipod.The rooms are individually air conditioned, in that you can choose off-medium-full, for the ventilation speed. I found it was a little warm but OK in reality. Not hot and humid like it is in mid August! Bed itself is very hard and pillow is a small one. There are several power sockets in the walls (2 flat pin ones) and one LAN (RJ45) port. There is no free wireless in the area. So if you have a laptop, it needs to have a LAN port (which my macbook air doesn't) and you'll need to supply your own network cable. No internet if your device only supports WIFI.Other than that, the toilets are like regular public toilets, except you need to take off your regular slippers and use the special toilet slippers - if you don't know what this is, you'll soon understand if you visit any traditional hotels in Japan.Separately, the bathroom is fairly large and has several wash basins. There were only 3 or 4 other people when I used it but I suppose at peak periods there could be over 25 guys at once (no idea about women's side..). There were only 2 showers that I saw. These are walk in showers with frosted doors, so some privacy. Soap, shampoo is provided. There are baskets outside the shower to leave your stuff in it. I took my towel in with me into the shower and hung it on the door handle since there were no hooks. But you risk getting the towel wet. I think the Japanese just stroll around naked. There was also a communal hot bath but I didn't use it.There's also laundry machines should you need to wash any clothes.By the reception there are vending machines and computers to access the internet. Overall, basic facilities but on the whole clean and serves its purpose. Probably every airport should have one of these!","London, United Kingdom","robato_kun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",65,3.0
