I stayed here for 4 nights with my family of 2 adults and 2 kids. Our room was big with a huge changing room/closet/make up room which I felt took up too much space. I would have preferred the extra space in the bedroom. I expected our room to be really luxurious, this being the Peninsula after all, but it was not as luxurious as I had expected. The room was still very nice but just not as nice as the Ritz Carlton or Grand Hyatt both of which I stayed at in Tokyo before. The Peninsula is located in Yurakucho so it was very convenient for shopping, eating and public transit. We spent all of time exploring Tokyo so we didn't use any of the hotel facilities. For the price of the Peninsula, there are other high end hotels available that are more luxurious and so I will choose a different one next time.","Singapore, Singapore","Ken_Ip_in_SG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",7,4.0

Everything you could want was where you wanted it to be. Our view was extraordinary. We enjoyed delightful breakfasts in the lower floor cafe and later on the rooftop level. We had several wonderful dinners in the lobby restaurant at our favorite table. Check in and check out was quick and friendly.

From the moment you pull up to the door there is exceptional service. I was at the Tokyo Peninsula for 1 day on the end of my four month trip around asia and would have stayed longer but the Coronavirus had just shut down all the museums and i started my trip off in Tokyo so only needed one evening there to fly in and out of the city. I had walked by the hotel on my first stay in the city 4 months early and admired it from the outside and its location. It’s perfectly situated across the gardens and the palace and in the Ginza distract. I checked in and was treated with kindness and warmth. The concierge assisted me in making my dinner reservation for the evening. The front desk staff showed me around my amazing room. It was so luxurious and plush and comfortable. I almost wanted to stay inside the entire day in bed and to take a bath in the insane tub because it was do perfect but with just one day I wanted to explore Ginza and all its stores. When i got back to the room after a long day out the bed was perfectly turned down, slippers out, water out, and the few things I left on the bed when i rushed out where hung up. What a treat!. Also worth noting - the gym was a great place to visit before hitting a long flight in the morning. I cant wait to come back to Tokyo and visit the Peninsula again when I have more time to stay in the city.","New York City, New York","394tammier</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",1,5.0

And I've stayed at a lot of nice hotels!! I was beyond impressed with everything. The rooms were huge, and so luxury down to every detail (ie: outdoor temp thermometer in the closets, nail dryer in the vanity...) and the service was amazing. Shout out to their concierge team, particularly Steve, who basically planned our entire trip. I emailed them about once a day for two weeks leading up to our stay and they set us up with amazing reservations and recommendations. The hotel is also located in the amazing Ginza district, with a ton to do in walking distance. But more than that, the basement level is actually a metro stop on the H line! So it's 3 stops away from Roppongi, where we also spent a lot of time. The staff is so accommodating, they actually walked us to the basement and helped us buy our metro tickets on the first day. Everyone was so kind! When my husband wasn't feeling well, we called the concierge and a bellman went to the pharmacy to get him some medication. Also, worth noting, the food was amazing! We ate breakfast here everyday, went to Sushi Wakon for dinner (will write a separate review on that - AMAZING) and to the Peter one afternoon for sunset views and cocktails. During this trip to Japan, we also stayed at the AMAN Kyoto and the Park Hyatt Tokyo and to be honest - the Peninsula Tokyo was our favorite hotel. 5 star everything! We can't wait to go back.

I am ambassador elite with Marriott, so have stayed in my fair share of nice hotels in Asia in particular. This Peninsula is a great property with a super friendly staff. The minute you walk in the lobby to check in the staff gives you their attention and takes care of your needs. The room/suite was quite big for Tokyo, clean, zero smell, and the bed/linens was extremely soft and comfortable. I slept very well. The hotel also managed to secure a reservation for 2 to Jiro's, which is a difficult reservation to get. My friend and I had to cancel due to his having to go back to the USA early, but I revived my part of the reservation and made it to Jiro's. The concierge had plenty of information about what to do in Tokyo, what sights to see, where to go, very helpful people.Overall, a top notch luxury property with first class staff from front desk, to the housekeeping especially, to concierge.

The other option is in the lobby which is also the only reasonably priced venue for lunch and dinner. The lobby is very open, busy and loud and tends to be chilly from the front doors nearby. It’s just odd to be having dinner while luggage is rolling past and tired travelers are slogging through.

Having had the pleasure of staying at The Peninsula Shanghai a few years ago, I'd already been sold on the brand and consider these hotels among the finest in the world and certainly the best I've ever enjoyed. And yet The Peninsula Tokyo managed to exceed even that high standard - all in one night. As we checked in for our stay, we were informed that the hotel was aware of my special occasion and elected to upgrade our room based on availability - I didn't really know what that meant in the moment, but a standard room at Shanghai was more than enough for my stay then, and I knew anything above that would be even better. Sure enough, we soon discovered that our upgraded room was a corner Deluxe Suite, with a breathtaking view over the Imperial Palace and downtown Tokyo, complete with a sitting room, dining area, workspace, separate master bedroom, changing room, bath and shower in the marble bathroom, and even a powder room. It's important to note that without this unexpected surprise, I wouldn't have been disappointed... the service was white-glove from the taxi to the front desk, and I know a regular room would have been just as impressive, but that the hotel thought to make my one-night special event even more special was really above and beyond and deeply appreciated. As one expects from The Peninsula, the room was immaculate and spotless; even the couches were vacuumed and the doors wiped clean near the handles. I will often use sani-wipes to clean commonly-touched surfaces in hotel rooms, and I found it was almost overkill here.I also had the chance to enjoy The Peninsula Spa during my stay, and found the service and attention there to be stellar. My full-body massage was among the better I've had anywhere in the world, and the little details The Peninsula adds throughout the experience made it feel like it was truly one of the best spas in the city (which I believe it has been ranked to be in the past). The beautiful pool and gym rounded out the spa space, and the team was incredibly courteous in showing me around before my spa appointment and making sure that all of my questions were answered generally before they were asked.Check-out the next morning was smooth and effortless; the complimentary (included) breakfast served in our room was outstanding and the eggs were perfectly prepared, and temped well despite the travel from the kitchen. A taxi was waiting for us after the check-out was complete, and without my notice our bags had already been loaded into the vehicle, so all we had to do was sit and go. The concierge team followed us outside and bowed as we left - which I know is ordinary in hotels all across Japan - but still it left a great impression departing from this really extraordinary place.I'm not sure when I'll have the chance to stay at The Peninsula again - admittedly it's beyond the budget for most of our trips overall, let alone multiple nights - but when I do, I know I'll savor each moment as much as I did this time. For those who are able and wish to enjoy a truly seamless and luxurious hotel stay, this is a natural spot to consider.",,Conor F,3,5.0

The hotel is far superior to all other 5 star hotels in Tokyo. The hotel is an absolute credit to the CEO or General Manager and the team of staff who have clearly been employed not just because they are qualified but because they are also well suited to their jobs and enjoy their jobs. Every staff member in this hotel delivers a perfect service and we are able to make this claim as we ate in every restaurant, even had room service breakfasts, used the concierge service and reception were a pleasure to deal with, and even down to the lady on the door, and the staff just outside the door, it was a perfect service throughout the entire hotel, which is rare to find these days. Check in:The reception staff spoke perfect English even though they are Japanese. They were so well mannered and welcoming. We arrived from a long flight and we arrived too early for check in and understood this, and were just planning on checking in and leaving our bags until check in. We actually arrived at 6.15am in the morning due to the flight arrival. To our surprise, reception said that they would escort us to our room and there was our name and gifts all set out for us. The lovely lady showed us how to operate features in the room, and actually connected our phones for us to the free internet. The gratitude we felt that a hotel actually went out of its way to allow us in to a room this early is something we will always remember. They didn't have to do this of course and we understood check in was later on.  The room:We were astounded by the room. It was on the 20th floor. It is of such high quality and has been masterfully designed. It is also large and has high ceilings with intricate detailing in the ceiling and unusual lights. The bed was a spotless king bed with high quality linen and pillows. The bedside tables are so clever, you can touch them anywhere during the night if you are wondering what time it is, and the time on the clock comes on. When you turn off the lights at bed time, the time on the clock goes off so you don't have to put a face cloth over it to cover the glare. We've all had to do that. Not in this hotel. The clock goes dark and all you do is put your hand anywhere on the table and it comes on. And its on both bedside tables so you don't have to look over your partner to see the time. The curtains and blinds are all motorised and absolutely beautiful. The carpet is of high quality. The decor in the room is sensational. The lounge was so comfortable, and the TV was perfectly positioned. There was a well set out study desk and chair with accessories and a table perfectly positioned on the window with 2 very comfortable chairs. We didn't book a suite, this is just how our room was. We booked a room that had Imperial Garden views and I believe that these rooms are located on higher floor levels. The Bathroom:The bathroom had large his and her vanities totally separate from each other but in the same bathroom with large areas so you could set your items out which we like to do. The bath was amazing with a rainfall spout and lovely cosmetics. The bathroom was all marble. The toilet was in its own area with door and NOT in the bathroom which is nice. The shower is a rainfall shower and if you don't like that, you can have a standard type of shower head if you prefer. There is a built in seat in there too. The towels are all of high quality as are the robes and slippers. The bathroom was so clean it was wonderful. The windows in the room:These are extremely high double glazing. Not all double glazing is equal. We could not hear anything outside. Our view was to the Imperial Palace Gardens.Sound Proofing:This is the ONLY hotel we have been to where sound proofing is taken seriously. When you walk into the room, they have put in during construction a sliding door that you can close off from your entry hall to the bedroom, so you don't pick up any noise from the corridors, eg people closing their doors or walking around talking. This was fantastic and a real credit to the architect of the hotel. Every hotel should be like this.The Walk in Robes:They aren't really walk in robes. Its a Walk in Room. It is so beautifully finished and even has a dressing table with chair in there, and it has lots of hanging space, lovely big draws, and if a lady wanted to paint her nails you can put your hands into a nail drying machine. The lighting is superb too and every little detail has been considered. So much space to set out your shoes and having the chair in the walk in dressing room means you can sit down and put your socks and walking shoes on if you are going out for a big day. Room Service:This is no ordinary room service.A very polite and courteous man arrives and sets up a silver service breakfast and puts the napkin on your lap and treats you like you are a king and queen. Even if you are only having cereal, and toast, the effort that goes into making your breakfast is wonderful. The Peninsula coffee was 10 out of 10 and we are very fussy when it comes to coffee and could never fault the coffee on any day. We also noticed that the breakfast was delivered at the precise time. To the minute. This must just be a co-incidence we thought. But no, it was like this every day. And every day the same respectful polite service from this gentleman who you could clearly see was so well suited to his job and took his job seriously. Also the person who answered the phone when we booked the room service was excellent. The attention to detail was evident in everything they did. The Lobby Restaurant:The food is amazing in this restaurant, it is so fresh and beautifully presented. The live entertainment provides a wonderful ambience. It is not noisy the music.The lobby Manager, Eisuke Nagano provides the guests with a 6 star dining experience. He goes above and beyond. He is so professional, highly trained and experienced, speaks excellent English, and goes out of his way to ensure you have a memorable experience. The waitress was so helpful with the wines. Nothing was of any trouble. Try this wine, have a try of this one, we want to make sure you enjoy the wine you have chosen. It was so relaxing in this lobby restaurant. It also has a cheerful atmosphere that reflects the attitude of the staff. Peter Restaurant and Bar on the top floor:If you are looking for a dining experience that is pure perfection with faultless service and stunning views and decor, try this restaurant. It was superb. The staff were the same as the rest of the hotel. Well suited to their jobs, clearly like their jobs, and ensure the guests have a memorable occasion. The menu was really excellent and there is something on that menu for everyone.The basement cafe in the hotel:We thought we were just going to a cafe, however the lunch we had was astonishing. It was absolutely beautiful and we had silver service, and impeccable service and food. It was also so well priced too. You can also go to the take away counter if you don't want to sit down in the cafe itself. The food was beautiful and so fresh. You can also watch chefs down there making food and making desserts.Concierge:So helpful and kind. They went out of their way to be helpful and also spoke very good English. The reason why we keep mentioning this is, we stayed at another 5 star hotel in Tokyo on another occasion, and the staff could hardly speak English and if they did, they didn't actually know what you were asking. At The Peninsula, the English spoken by the Japanese staff is excellent. The pool:It is so clean and has lounges all around with a peaceful ambience and lovely views. Please do not change the set up and rules for the pool. Finally a pool that is peaceful and a pleasure to be in. The standard overall:It is evident that the CEO or the General Manager, has high standards and this high standard is projected right through the hotel. The staff are also genuinely sincere and so well mannered and friendly. The CEO or General Manager should be congratulated for the standard that has been set at The Peninsula in Tokyo. Conclusion:We could not fault this hotel in any way. Even down to little things like the corridors. The corridors are so beautiful, all mood lighting with views down the centre of the building if you choose to look, with crystal hanging inside the centre. However if you didn't go over to it, you would just think it was a painting on the wall, but it was a vaulted void through the hotel all fully enclosed and very moody and romantic looking. The corridors were so quiet and no racket from cleaners. The naturally friendly attitude from the gentlemen who stand just outside the entry, were there to assist you with a taxi if you needed one, or directions, and were so well dressed and greeted you warmly every time you walked in and out with a big smile. The nice young lady on the rotating swinging door, is there to ensure you are ok with the door which automatically opens and goes around anyway, however little things like this stood out as this would be the most boring job yet she did her job with joy and smiled and greeted everyone. We would go out and come back hours later and still she was there with a big smile and so beautiful towards the Peninsula guests.This is a hotel for people who want a life time memory. This is not just a place to sleep and shower. It is an experience. Japan should be proud that it has such a high standard hotel in its capital city Tokyo. The other 5 star hotels in Tokyo don't even come close to this one. That's why if they are a 5 star then The Peninsula should easily be a 6 or 7 star. It's much better than the Burj at Dubai, which is a 6 star hotel. The hotel is also in a high class area that is very central. To The Peninsula Hotel: Thank you for providing us with an experience we will never forget. You made our trip to Japan one that we will always remember. We sincerely thank you for providing us with a beautiful room on the 20th floor at such an early hour of the morning, when we did not expect this as we all know check in is much later on. What a wonderful kind gesture to do this when we didn't even ask. Thank you.",Australia,"TarakayAustralia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",228,5.0

The Peninsula is in a MUCH more convenient location, as others have said, and the rooms are large and very very comfortable, but I would say that Park Hyatt is more beautiful hotel. But that might just come down to preference on the style - Park Hyatt is more modern/contemporary, Peninsula is more old school, even slightly dated. So this review is mostly about Peninsula, but I can't help comparing the two slightly...Pros:Location location location! The closest station is Hibiya, but Yurakucho (more convenient in how many places you can get to from there) is just 5 mins easy walk. Under the train tracks there are many many small restaurants, so cool! Also it's just a 5-10 min walk to Ginza, or Tokyo Station. Super convenient! Also the big park across the road and Imperial Palace nearby. Unfortunately we didn't get to those this visit because it was way too hot. The room is large and comfortable, and has a separate lounge area, so it feels a bit like an apartment. Double sinks (our room at Park Hyatt only had one so we appreciated it!) in the bathroom, and the typical Peninsula lovely large dressing room with butler box. Also USB ports and wireless charger in bedside drawers was handy - this is one modernisation we really noticed and enjoyed.Service felt more personable, less stiff - AT FIRST, there were a couple of staff who really stood out as being friendly. There is a 'con' for this one as well...Lovely big Jacuzzi in pool area! I don't normally do laps in the pool, but I do love a relax in a jacuzzi!ConsI agree with other reviews, the lobby area seems odd. One day there was a wedding going on so we had to use the side entrance instead of the main entrance, and felt a bit bad walking past them in shorts.There are also people dining there, having high tea every day - and there is a dress code. So we always felt a bit awkward walking through, when we've been out exploring Tokyo all day, hot and sweaty from 40c outside and wearing shorts flip flops etcThe breakfast was lovely, but it's either taken in the lobby (weird as I said), or in the basement for the buffet - lovely buffet but the space does feel very much like a basement, not that nice.We had a drink in the bar upstairs, and it was nice enough, but nothing on the New York bar at Park Hyatt.The one thing I really didn't like, and perhaps it's a symptom of the awkwardness of the lobby - is that I felt quite uncomfortable from staff (not the personable ones, but the more formal, stuffy ones) staring when we were walking in after a long day of sight-seeing, I felt really underdressed and as it it wasn't acceptable. Maybe it was in my imagination, I didn't feel like that later dressed for dinner... But then when we checked out we asked if we could leave our bags and use the pool/spa area to freshen up later since our flight back to Australia wasn't until 11pm. The lady at reception was lovely and said of course.... but then when we came back in the afternoon (hot again as it was CRAZY hot and the day after the typhoon), the lady at the front door was quite abrupt in saying we couldn't come back in after we'd checked out - and it felt almost as if we weren't even welcome in the lobby - take our bags and go! So that wasn't a very nice feeling. Then after we pleaded and said reception told us earlier that it would be ok - she allowed us to go to reception. They sorted it out, but then when we went to the change rooms and I came out to go to a spa to meet my husband there (male/female change rooms opposite sides of the room) the lady there chased me down and I had to explain to her I'm meeting my husband - ""is that ok""? She looked a bit miffed..... So I felt very unwelcome, even though we'd been there for 3 days already, and I don't think asking to freshen up before our long overnight flight after most of the day outside in extreme heat was and unreasonable request. Anyway - that feeling of discomfort and being unwelcome really put me off - we are not scruffy, but we are certainly not stuffy either. We stay in luxury hotels all the time, and I've never felt that uncomfortable. All was redeemed though when a LOVELY gentleman in the lobby area gave us advice on how best to get to the airport (given the typhoon transport delays), and chatted to us as he walked us out to the street. He was fantastic! Maybe they noticed? not sure. But the lady at the reception who greeted us when we arrived, and the gentleman who helped us at the end, could give lessons to the others on how to smile more and make people feel more comfortable.So, while it's a beautiful hotel and excellent location, we'd stay somewhere different next time.","Sydney, Australia","MissMotivated</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",118,4.0

From sept. 1st to the 10th. 2019. From the moment I got off the shuttle bus, the staffed took my luggage and walked me to the check in desk. If you want to splurge they do offer car service pickup from Norita airport to hotel. Rolls Royce $640, BMW $580, Tesla S $460, Van $460 and taxi $264. I took the Limousine Bus from the airport to the PEN. Cost was 30 bucks per person. The shuttle desk was right in front, when you’re done with immigration and picking up luggage. No issues with the shuttle,A/C and comfortable. The shuttle will make about 5 stops before dropping you off at the PEN. I opted for the Tesla S from hotel to Norita airport. The driver was polite and the ride was comfortable. He got me to the airport in 1hr and 30 min. The shuttle will take about 2hours. The staffed here is top notch. The person that checked me in(sorry didn’t get her name). She welcomed me and got all my info registered in 5 min. If you used AME Platinum card. The PEN Will give you a complementary room upgrade if available? I booked a premier king room, they gave me a king room with a garden view of the imperial palace. She then walked me up to my room. She stayed a few mins. To show the room and it’s offerings. The staff ppl were fantastic and take pride in their jobs. The room also came with complementary breakfast every morning. First day of breakfast down stairs in the cafe. One gentleman with glasses I saw everyday(didn’t get his name:) he knew my name and always greeted each morning. Then 5 min later Lobby Assistant MGR( David Tao:) came over to introduce himself to me and welcome me. I didn’t expect that. He also, greeted me each morning and knew my name. WOW! There’s also a buffet downstairs, you have the option of cafe, buffet or room service. The servers were all nice and fantastic. They seem to take pride in their work.

Bathroom has a rain shower, was fantastic. Automatic toilet that opens, closes and auto flush. The bath tub was super larger. It has a TV with plenty of controls from the tub. The bed was comfy, I slept pretty good all 9 days. A/C was great and super quiet. The lighting in the room was great too. You can dim the light at night to enjoy the view of Tokyo. The lights have 3 settings for your liking. The maid service was excellent. Everyday, it was cleaned plus every night they get the room ready for bed. Everyday they give you 4 bottles of water no charge and ice 2 times per day. They also gave me 2 glass lens cloth, the little things. Room also had a dinning table, couch to relax and a mini office. It even had a printer. Tea pot and cups if you want tea. Coffee machine. The drawers next to the bed had a wireless charger. This room had tons of gadgets and controls. Safe for valuables and laundry service. You name it this hotels got it! Only thing I thought needed upgrading was it had a old DVD player and the tv had old SVG and AV cable inputs. I couldn’t use it cause I have HDMI wires. The gym was kinda small, had a few running machines, one bike machine. Not a whole lot of weights. The infinity pool was beautiful. The resting area had a great view of Tokyo. Hotel restaurant peter located on the top floor. Hei fung terrance, Chinese restaurant and sushi wakon on the 4th floor. I didn’t try any cause there’s plenty of great food outside the hotel. The cafe also serves afternoon tea. Theirs also a cafe down stairs serves coffee and desserts after 11am. I tried it one day and it was great. Other food options if you want something different. There’s 7-11 across the street ( yes! In America 7-11 and convenience stores foods are crappy) in Japan, food it great and plenty of options at reasonable prices. Lawson’s connivence store is next to the PEN. Starbucks is also next to the PEN. Plenty of food options next to the hotel. Location is near Ginza district. Lots of high end brand name stores. There’s a subway station right underneath the hotel, Hibiya line. Yurakucho subway located block and a half from the hotel next Bic camera store. By subway, most of the popular locations are 15-30 mins away. If you need to ride the JR rail lines, it’s 15 mins. By subway to Tokyo Station. You can take taxi or hire one of their nice cars, if you’re in a hurry. Every staff member greeted me with “hello”, “good morning”, good evening”, and when you come back from a long day, “welcome home”. One of the best hotels I’ve stayed at.

Comfy beds and bedding and a sitting area, as well. I can attest to the building’s safety as we experienced an earthquake while we were there (on the 18th floor!). All we felt was a slight sway and the pendant lights began to swing slightly. It was off putting and it took us a moment to realize what was happening, but it was over as quickly as it began and there was no damage. I suppose local people are used to it.

I am very particular about places I stay, and the Peninsula is the top of my list for business travel. I stayed in the supposedly superior Imperial Hotel, but wasn’t impressed (smaller rooms, dated decor).Having stayed in many leading hotels of the world, this is the best and I always stay when in Tokyo. I always get the Park View rooms which face out with huge floor to ceiling windows. The Park view Room is effectively a suite it has a large bedroom/living area, with a corridor which leads to a large luxurious bathroom and large dressing room which is good for keeping luggage out the way,The house keeping service is impeccable. The staff take great care and they spend a great deal of time cleaning the rooms (which they can do at any time on demand, rather than disrupting your morning by knocking on the door).The breakfast service is exceptional, and the choices for the breakfast menu (which is included usually) are not limited. Instead of restricting items from the menu on the breakfast plan (which most hotels do - cutting out the best options usually) they give each guest a budget (about 7700 JPY per person, which is more than enough to over every option available). The location is fantastic for underground access. The hotel has its own entrance to Hibya station which is very convenient for Akihabara, Nakano, otemachi, ikebukero, asaksa etc. The hotel is also adjacent to the imperial palace and gardens in Chiyoda which is also a short walk from Ginzan and Marounouchi.The only downside I can point to is that I find the staff to be a bit too servile/over the top on occasion. Many will appreciate this, but in the UK (where I live) we don’t generally have this to the same degree. For example, I got in a lift after a cleaner also entered and she apologised profusely and started saying “oh no! Sorry sir! May I share this lift with you, Im so sorry”. Also when they come to the rooms (to deliver room service etc) they tend to hang back too much for my liking and fuss a bit too much. This is my own persona view - I suspect that such service is expected by many international travellers and may be specifically what some people enjoy about the hotel. They treat you like a celebrity.",,BarristerTraveller,11,5.0

I still feel bad about their services and decide I need to express my dissatisfaction. I highly suggest anyone plans to utilize hotel concierge services stay away from this hotel. The room is spacious and new, which are as expected for the price they charge. The lobby is small and overcrowded. They turn both sides of the small lobby into a restaurant, leaving only a narrow aisle leading to the front desk with limited seats for waiting. The concierge service is atrocious. They are irresponsive and make mistakes (multiple of them). Some due to disorganization from the top, some due to carelessness, some due to who knows what funny reasons I fail to think of out of normal reasoning. 1) they are irresponsive. We emailed to request reservation of restaurants. It took them a whole three days to respond, only acknowledging the email had been received without any warm greetings or action plan. I regret not canceling despite this red flag!2) they are disorganized. we had to make international phone calls to remind them to take action on a timely manner ( I don’t know who is supposed to assist whom). To their credit, they usually act immediately after the phone call. But whoever followed up obviously got totally disconnected with the last person handling the matter. They seemed to have no record of previous communications. They asked the same questions we’d answered before, they double booked restaurants already booked, etc. 3) they made us pay for their mistakes! one restaurant on our list is quite pricy and upon reservation no cancellation is allowed. So we were very careful and highlight and bold counter seats only! If counters not ok we will not reserve! And Guess what, they booked a private room for us, which offered a totally different (and much less enjoyable) experience! 4) they are just too thoughtful... one restaurant on our list is an eel specialist. We emphasized that we would order natural wild caught eel. To our surprise, when we got to the restaurant we were served with farmed eel. The restaurant called the hotel to ask if something was wrong. Yes, it turned out they made a mistake. And guess what they told us? They ordered farmed eel for us for budget control. Ha, when and where did we ever mention budget?? If they were really so thoughtful and considerate, why not just offer to compensate us for the $$$ we paid for the their mistake in 3)? 5) they are not too thoughtful. One restaurant on our list we got the contact information from the chef. So we asked them not call until a certain time because we don’t want to appear abusing the relationship. Ha, they just called, not once but twice, way ahead of time. Nice job and proactive. 6) maybe they just have no clue? One restaurant on our list we have been to many times. The hotel we usually stayed at would point that out to the restaurant, so we were always able to reserve a good time slot. But peninsula just totally ignored this background we told them, and consequently was able to only reserved a very undesirable time for us. I suspect they ignored the background because they didn’t know it could help reservation. If this is the case, it just tells how unprofessional they are. If not, it only means they are either careless to detail, or careless of their customers, or both. 7) with all the disappointments, they at least offered a joke for us to laugh at... one restaurant on our list happened to have peninsula on their blacklist (we didn’t know when we made the list). Haha, of course they didn’t tell us about that. They just said they strongly discourage us to reserve for the restaurant because of unpleasant experiences other customers had before. Hmm.

We only had two nights at this location but it was enough to make an outstanding impression. We had a standard room with a city view; it was huge compared to normal hotel rooms and with every amenity you can think of (and even some I had never experienced before, such as the valet box and nail dryer). Service was impeccable from the doormen to the bellhops, the front desk to the concierge. There were so many refined touches. We did two of the Peninsula Academy adventures and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Our drivers stayed with us the whole time and became an integral part of the experience. Getting a city tour in the bespoke Mini Coopers was outstanding! I can't recommend the Academy enough and hope there are more experiences available when we return. A shout-out also to the door staff and concierge; we wanted to go someplace recommended by one of the drivers but didn't realize we needed advance reservations until the gentleman escorting us to the taxi asked us if we had tickets. We didn't, but the concierge was able to get us into an alternate location and we were off. That saved us a lot of disappointment if we had shown up with our young daughter and not been able to get in. Dining was also excellent; we ate breakfast in the lobby restaurant when we arrived and subsequently had room service. Food arrived quickly, was always freshly prepared, and the table set up beautifully. Location was also great; easy walking distance to Ginza, shopping, and restaurants. What else can I say other than we can't wait to return and are already planning a much longer stay next time. P.S. We also took the green Phantom Rolls Royce out - what a fun and unique experience!

For us it was The Peninsula Tokyo. We had stayed at the The Peninsula Hong Kong a couple of years ago which set the bar high but we had never been to Tokyo before so there was the question of location versus other options. The Peninsula Tokyo scored exceptional high on the that, too.To start with location, The Peninsula is in Hibiya which is on the other side of the tracks from the famed Ginza shopping district but just opposite Hibiya Park and the Imperial Gardens. That is all properly swank. The interesting bit is Yarukucho (which you could argue is the true location of the hotel). This is the bit between the hotel and the Japan Rail and Shinkansen train tracks. This area is more down market but in the best possible way. The arches under the tracks are packed with local restaurants including a German beer garden and a couple of surprisingly good Italian joints.What this also means is the entire Tokyo subway and rail systems are right there. For transportation within Tokyo and beyond, the Peninsula is unbeatable.The Peninsula Tokyo is built on a surprisingly small parcel of land but they get a lot of goodness into it. Our room was a standard king but it included a large closet and dressing room to the right as you’d walk in and large bathroom with individual his and hers vanities, a soaker tub and a shower opposite that. The room is big enough to have a sitting area in addition to the bed. And - as a personal first - the room included a combo printer, scanner, fax machine which we did actually use.The hotel has a spa and indoor salt-water infinity pool. The pool is configured for doing laps and has a beautiful view of Hibiya Park and the Imperial Gardens. Like everywhere else is the hotel, the service is extremely attentive. And, similarly, the standards of upkeep are extremely high. We watched one afternoon as five staff members determined the best way to remove scuff marks from the walls.The concierge service was absolutely exemplary. Before we arrived, they helped us secure some difficult restaurant reservations. While we were there, they helped out with an emergency dental appointment as will as some further restaurant details. The late Anthony Bourdain may have disliked the typical concierge restaurant recommendations, but that certainly would not apply here.While the Peninsula Hong Kong has pads for all of its room controls, the Tokyo hotel makes do with slightly less tech-forward controls with physicals buttons. You can still adjust the lights and open and close the blinds from the bed so there is nothing wrong with that approach. The only tech complaint I have is that the the TV has a range of analog inputs but lacks the much more useful HDMI input.The Peninsula has afternoon tea in the lobby. It may not have the line of people waiting for a seat that you’d see in Hong Kong but it is still a nice selection of savoury and sweet. The only complaint is that it took about 45 from ordering to receiving our food.The basement has one of the two restaurants that serves breakfast. What’s really interesting downstairs is that you get to watch the bakers and the chocolatiers. The baked goods are very good and the chocolates - made from Valrhona and Callebaut chocolate - are exceptionally good.A family member has some specific nut allergies so there was a question about whether or not the chocolate truffles would be OK for him. We called room service who had the chocolatiers call us and, ultimately, one of them came to our room - with extra truffles - just to make sure our question was answered satisfactorily. That’s attention to detail.Combine all of the above with Japanese hospitality and an unbeatable location, there is little to negative say about The Peninsula Tokyo.","Waterloo, Canada","WaterlooMarmiton</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waterloo, Canada</strong>",16,5.0

Also, a couple channels in English on the TV would be greatly appreciated to be able to access when on the exercise bike. Except for these trivial items, this is one of the rare examples of getting what you pay for.

I would not consider any other hotel in Tokyo. The location is perfect, within walking distance to many attractions and amazing restaurants.

Very quite at night, although I suppose for some people that's a negative, but you are only a few blocks away from vibrant nightlife. Best of both worlds. Staff are impeccable and helpful. While rooms could use some face lift, they are sizable and clean. I love the view of the imperial palace in the mornings. Concierge is what really knocks it out of the park. They are incredibly helpful and their suggestions are always spot on.My favorite thing to do at the hotel is using their gym, which is next to the pool. After a good work out, hit the steam and sauna rooms. Very relaxing and I've never seen more than another person in the spa. It's almost as if you have the entire place to yourself.

High end service from the moment they opened the door of our cab and escorted us to check in. Despite the fact that we presented ourselves at 9:30 in the morning, not only did they upgrade us to a magnificent suite, but it was ready for us and we were immediately escorted to the suite. Our luggage had already been delivered to the suite, and the suite was HUGE, with a living room with two walls of glass, facing the Imperial Gardens and Palace directly across the street. The separate bedroom area featured a large bedroom, a large dressing area with closets, and well appointed bathroom with the fully automated Japanese heated toilet/bidet, large tub at the window, and a serious rainfall shower with almost too much pressure. There was also a guest bath that we never used. The bed was extremely comfortable, with high end linens. Breakfast was included, and we took it at the lobby restaurant all three days, and the meal and service were excellent. They also have a relatively new program for suite guests that gives you access to two Mini Coopers with driver on a first come first served basis, for up to three hours per day for each day of your stay, between the hours of 9:30 am and 7:30 pm. We used the service on one day for transportation to the Robot Restaurant show, which would otherwise have been a $50 taxi ride. There are several restaurants and a bar on property, all on the expensive side. We had two cocktails at Peter's Bar on the 24th floor, and by the time the various taxes and service charges were added, it came to $48. At least there were tasty bar snacks.

As an often grumpy guest, I could not find a single instance of an improvement I could recommend - they have truly thought of everything. From bedside controllers for heat/ac, lights, and music to the large, well-thought-out, walk-in closets - these rooms live much larger than they are (and they’re pretty big.) The room feels more like a penthouse apartment than a hotel room. The bathrooms are not just sumptuous, but smartly designed with everything well-laid out and within easy reach. Every morning we enjoyed breakfast in the smaller, Boutique Cafe in the basement. It included some buffet items as well as alacarte items. It seemed much quieter and more peaceful than breakfast in the lobby. The staff were friendly, attentive, professional and efficient. The hotel is very-well located. A short walk in any direction will land you in a different dynamic neighborhood. On Saturday there’s a wonderful flea market just a few minutes walk from the hotel, and there are several subway lines within a 5 minute walk for trips further afield.I think the world would be well-served if Peninsula would close this hotel to the public. They could then invite hoteliers and hospitality workers from around the world to stay here and learn how great hospitality is delivered. Although this is an expensive hotel, the things that make it great are not always expensive to deliver; they are the small, constant, extremely thoughtful gestures that demonstrate their wholehearted commitment to providing their guests with a perfect stay.I did have a discrepancy with the hotel over additional taxes and fees that were added to my bill when I checked out. I did not feel that these additional fees had been properly disclosed to me when making my reservation through American Express. Although it required a bit more persistence than I would have liked, The Peninsula corrected the discrepancy to my satisfaction and have corrected the way in which these fees are disclosed on Amex’s travel site. I am so glad this got resolved, as it removed my only disappointment and confirmed my sense that Peninsula Hotels is an organization that hears its guests and truly takes their concerns to heart.

Staff went to great lengths to help and a young guy on the front desk was a die hard Patriots fan who helped me make sure I get to watch the Super Bowl.One major criticism is that the ground floor lobby restaurants closes way too early at 9 pm. Sometimes we wanted to sit and have a hot drink after returning from dinner. Also the breakfast bread basket is very stingy. When you ask for some toast, they only give you one slice!Love the hotel overall though.","Bangkok, Thailand","535jeepc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",37,5.0

I narrowed it down to The Pen, The Ritz, Mandarin or Aman. Had stayed in NYC Peninsula Hotel once and that pushed me towards The Pen in Tokyo. Tokyo location has nicer bathrooms and more attentive staff. Never waited a moment for anything. The staff is fluent in English and anticipates your needs. If they sense you want to linger then they let you linger. If you are in a hurry then they almost run getting you what you need. During evening dinner rush there are 6 people staffing the front of the hotel and speak directly to your taxi since even with an address some of the restaurants are hard to find. Tell the concierge you want to go watch hunting and they print a couple maps with directions. Or ask about walking the Imperial gardens and they suggest taking in the close by shrine also.As far as the lobby restaurant, i thought it was really unique for breakfast since there was always action. The included breakfast was full (croissant, yogurt, 2 eggs, bacon, toast, grapefruit juice, coffee or Japanese) and was delicious. I never ate dinner there but why would you with more Michelin restaurants in Tokyo than France. The concierge arranged 3 dinner reservations before our arrival.I will skip the incredible room because it has been covered elsewhere.I dont think the spa gets the attention it deserves. Try going for just a sauna before dinner and i promise you will be completely refreshed. Truly an oasis. I frequent the Four Seasons spa in DC and until now thought it was indulgent.We went for drinks in the lounges at the Ritz and the Aman. The Ritz is stuck in the past and the service was really slow, understaffed and frustrating in comparison. The Aman was very hip with a beautiful lounge with live sax accompanying electronic DJ. If it was in a better neighborhood it might be a consideration. The Ginza neighborhood is great for shopping with everything from Dr Martens to Prada. About 7 minutes to the Tokyo station so you can take the bullet train nonstop to Narita.There is also a subway line in the basement once you get comfortable.Bottom line is if you are Marriott, SPG or Ritz platinum then consider them due to your personal advantage. But if not then The Pen. I think part of what makes it work is they dont have any frequent flyer program so it is just paying guests. you will see that all the other 5 star hotels occupy the top 10-15 floors of office buildings. The Pen is stand alone and much easier to run up to the room between shopping, visiting a shrine and dinner.",gtown,"gtown86</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>gtown</strong>",5,5.0

At 54 square meters, however, it's Junior Suite-like in its size and layout; there was a sitting area and a desk, and the bathroom and dressing area are quite large.Given that it's a city hotel in a city that we are intimately familiar with, we did not need (nor did we expect) much in the way of service. That said, all staff members (front desk, maids, doorman, waiters, etc.) were all on top of things, and did it with a smile.Tokyo is a very safe city with very convenient transportation options, so it's debatable whether it is necessary to splurge on a top-end hotel. Generally speaking, we've found rates at the Pen to be lower than its competitors (YMMV), making this a no-brainer when this is the case.","San Jose, California","KI-NRT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",148,5.0

He gave us a special discount at the Chinese restaurant. Fernando thank you so much for your service, you are an invaluable piece for the peninsula chain. The rooms are quite spacious and well organized, they could use a small refurbishing as they look a little outdated but if you get the view of the imperial palace (this time unfortunately I did not) you will forget everything. Even being a little outdated they are very comfortable, they have a small lounge and a very very big dressing room, the shower, WC and bath are perfect. The breakfast and the food at the Chinese restaurant are exceptional, try the carrot juice for breakfast and any kind of omelette, they are freshly made and perfect in presentation. The Chinese restaurant is amazing, every single thing is delicious and perfectly made) The gym is nice also, the only thing I did not like is you have to fill a registration (like a disclaimer) every time you go to the gym and it takes you a couple of minutes but if you go there every day it can be a little annoying.Overall I truly recommend this hotel, being here for the fourth time of course I would definitely come back again as They made me feel like it’s my home in Tokyo.

This is a perfect location for those food lovers and shopaholics. Lots of nice restaurants on the side streets branching out from the Chuo Dori. It’s situated right next to the Imperial palace and overlooking the Palace and the associated Kokyo Gaien National Garden. You can feel the hospitality of their doorman right from the moment we stepping off from our MK taxi. We were welcomed by their staff and we were led to our room for checking in. The process was swift and the intro of the hotel was quick and clear. The room decor is very traditional, nothing dandy but just.........very practical. You could tell the designer is really a hotel user when you look at the layout and the placement of those illuminated functional buttons. Everything is exactly where they should be. One thing which I have never seen in other hotels is the valet box which allows the hotel staff to deliver stuff to you without disturbing you. The lobby lounge is very Peninsula classy feel. The Chinese food quality is really good even compared to the standard in Hong Kong. The prawn they used for their Chinese prawn dumplings is surely not the frozen ones. The most impressive touch is they retain some of the staff which surely has passed their retirement age. But the mature gentleman that we met at the concierge speaks fluent English and he really knows his stuff well. We really appreciate his knowledge on the palace while we were just asking for directions so that our papa can have a good walk in the park. All in all it’s value for money staying at the Peninsula and I am glad that they are still putting customer service as their top priority despite they are surviving in such a competitive market nowadays.

Firstly, the hotel is gorgeous, after entering the hotel the first feeling I got was that everything was bright and beautiful. Upon checking in we were told that we had a complimentary upgrade and were placed in a gorgeous room facing the imperial palace with a full view of it. The room was extremely spacious, clean, and comfortable, the bathroom was gorgeous, the bath and the shower were a real treat. The wifi was free and I could have stayed in that room forever. Unlike the Mandarin, the Peninsula does not require to change lifts to access your room. The location was fantastic. As mentioned, it is near the Imperial Palace (which is well worth going to) and near Ginza station and all the stores (easy 15 minute walk max) as well as Marunouchi. For other travellers who may be interested, there's also a 7-11 or lawson nearby if you feel like getting anything there (I got an ice cream).The service was spectacular, from check-in to check-out, the staff were helpful, attentive, informative, and happy to answer any questions. They always had a smile and were extremely pleasant - I've rarely found the same service anywhere else. On top of that, because I was travelling with a friend and we were both girls they changed the toiletries in the room (which usually has one set for male and one female) accordingly. Whilst the Mandarin has more restaurants in the hotel, the food at the Peninsula is wonderful. They have an elaborate Japanese breakfast which is delicious, their room service is fantastic, everything from pasta to rice dishes are available so you'll not be short of options and the food is gorgeous so you won't be disappointed.

Given the fierce competition to reserve tokyo's hot restaurants, I have grown to expect prompt (same day) response and actions. This is NOT the case so far with the Peninsula. After the initial acknowledgement, I have not heard from the concierge desk for the past couple days ... this makes me really concerned what will happen when the restaurants start to take reservatiosn. Seats will be gone within a couple hours. I have never experienced anything similar with concierge response at other 5-star hotels in tokyo. I hope I am not overracting.

Now a lot of the good points remain - sizeable, well-designed rooms, great pool and spa, good food. This time though I noticed a few negatives. The rooms towards the back of the hotel are quite noisy - you are effectively sleeping next to busy railway tracks and train noise is constant from about 5am to after midnight. Sound insulation is not good. The lobby remains a negative for me, though many people love it. Essentially on arrival you have to make your way through a very crowded coffee shop to the check-in desks right at the back. Moreover, there is a ‘minstrels’ gallery’ above the coffee shop where a live band plays ‘smooth jazz’ Kenny G style all day and evening. I’m not a fan of background muzak anywhere but here it seems inappropriate and overly loud. Last the power charging options: hidden in a drawer by the bed, which somewhat disrupts the meticulous attention to detail in the rest of the room’s design - see photo.

The location is great and the lobby is very inviting with beautiful woodwork and art. Many times, there were musicians performing there as we came through, which was a nice touch. As others have mentioned, there's a cafe/restaurant in the lobby which you walk through to get to the reception desk, but we didn't mind and if gives it a little more of a lively feel. This lobby area is also where they serve breakfast, which absolutely shouldn't be missed as it was a highlight. Since we are from the U.S., we had the western breakfast most mornings, but on the final day we tried the dim sum breakfast, which was fantastic.We had two premier rooms, one king and one double (for the kids). As one would expect, they were identical except for the bed configuration. They are quite large and, as others have mentioned, include a large dressing room which is one of those things that you don't realize that you need until you have it! Now I wish all my hotel rooms had a large area like this to sit and do hair/makeup as well as organize all our belongings.The first evening, we had dinner at Kyoto Tsuruya which was very nice but we were tired from our long trip and honestly I don't remember anything too memorable about it (probably just because I was too tire to enjoy it properly). In hindsight, we should have gone to Peter, which looked fabulous but we never got a chance because we had made reservations on all the other nights elsewhere. Speaking of reservations, the Peninsula's concierge service was extremely helpful while planning this trip and they secured a great table at Kyubey Sushi for us and, to our surprise, even offered the hotel car, a beautiful Rolls Royce, to shuttle us there. What a special night!Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and honestly, we wish we had spent more time there.

We arrived by car a little after 11 am and were warmly greeted and escorted to checking. The lobby is anything but traditional. You literally walk through the lobby restaurant on your way to check-in. It is a little odd but at first, provides a great opportunity for people watching as we enjoyed our breakfast the next morning. As we were passed off to the front desk associate the warm pleasantries continued. This being our first trip to Japan I was surprised at how respectful yet friendly the people in Japan were. Check-in was completed within 5 minutes and we were escorted to our room. I should note for all those first timers out there that tipping in Japan is not done. So do not worry about the consistent interaction as it’s not a ploy for a tip but rather just a level of service that is maintained because that’s what service should be.Our room was large featuring a hallway with a closet/dressing room on one side and a large bath on the other. The Hallway opened to a large bedroom that was well appointed with a dining area, sitting area, workspace and King bed. The room featured a significant amount of automation in addition to several over the top items like a fax/copier and a cappuccino machine. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Wi-Fi was complimentary and fast enough to support streaming video content.The hotel itself is located in close proximity to the Imperial Palace, so close that we were able to walk to the place for a tour. Additionally, the property is surrounded by restaurants and other hotels so you don’t need to walk far to find a bite to eat or a drink. The Peninsula offered multiple restaurants on site so you really didn’t need to look far for a great meal. We really enjoyed Hei Fung Terrace, the Cantonese restaurant onsite as well as the pastry shop for breakfast on the lower level. One hidden gem at this property is that it has its own entrance to the subway. Take the elevator to the lower level and a walkway provides an easy path to Hibiya station.

The bed is sumptuous and the blackout curtains do wonders for a weary, jet lagged traveler. The food and beverage is certainly very expensive, as is the spa, but I'm impressed with the attention to detail and considerate service at every corner.

My only issue was with the bedding. The linens weren't very soft and the pillows were uncomfortable. I asked for firmer pillows, which were brought right away and that helped.

This review is tremendously hard to write as I do not know where to start.First off their attention to detail is second to none. I was traveling by myself- which can be challenging as a solo female especially with a language barrier. Need not worry ! They were at the airport on time- the room as requested- was in a quiet location with a fantastic view of the IMperial Palace. ( I do recommend to pay extra for this)The lay out of the room breathes calm- much need after spending 2 weeks in the Philippines working. When traveling solo I order room service a lot- perhaps this is the only area for improvement. The hot items were warm- almost cold. Perhaps reviewing this may identify areas of potential change- I also experienced this at the Peninsula Manila which I had come from as well. Did not experience this at the Peninsula Chicago when I visited last summerOtherwise I highly recommend this property and especially want to thank Noriko Murata- Guest Relations Manager. She was very helpful with all details and I hope to visit again soon.,,katterhagen,2,5.0

Location....it is really convenient it is near the subway. It is only about 5 minutes walk to Ginza. The locale quite and away from the hussle and bussle of Ginza.2. Service..... staff were polite and always smiling .... everything at your beck and call3. Rooms..... large well appointed. My wife loved the walk in closet and vanity table.... wanted to take it home...What I thought could be better (but it may not be possible)1. View...... We had an upgrade to a room facing the palace garden, but a large office block was right in front of us so we could only see the garden at an angle.2. Lobby...whilst the lobby is nice, it is does not feel grand in a way the Peninsula Hong Kong does. All in all , Peninsula is highly recommended for their service for those wanting to stay near Ginza but not right in the middle of it.","Sydney, Australia","Eric L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",21,4.0

I'd like to offer one small observation please though - I wish the casual dining area (for breakfast, all-day dining including high tea) was not positioned right in the (premium) lobby area. While I do understand that this is in keeping with the Peninsula 'buzz' and tradition drawn from the mothership Hong Kong Peninsula - I do hope that Management will re-consider this as I found this jarring, especially when walking in from a long, tiring flight. Thank you otherwise, Peninsula Tokyo for a very memorable stay - including extending additional assistance to accept our baggage transfer upon our return from Kyoto, for our pick up enroute back to Haneda to catch our flight, even though we were no longer guests at the hotel.

For us, it was the small unexpected gestures that showed the hotel staff serves from the heart. Every time whether in Summer or Winter, after our run round the imperial palace, we are always greeted with a towel and a bottle of water at the entrance. My children were pleasantly surprised at their new year’s gift to us which consisted of sake, Japanese sweets and an ornament with explanation. We also found the soft toys of our kids humorously arranged on their beds when they returned to their room. They were so overwhelmed with the gesture. The hotel provided facilities to view the first sunset in 2018 and sake and soft drinks during the viewing, it was lovely and tranquil.

Luxury shopping at every corner, high end vertical malls sprinkled throughout the city. Phenomenal dining options within a five to ten minute walk from the hotel. Peter's restaurant at the Peninsula is also excellent (service and food) and the view and ambiance are gorgeous. The concierge staff is OUTSTANDING!! Two members of our group use a CPAP machine for sleeping. Distilled water is not readily available for purchase in Japan. The concierge staff ordered the water from Amazon and it was waiting in our room upon arrival and when we returned from Kyoto. The concierge team provided excellent suggestions for shopping and dining. Make sure you take the Japanese card telling taxi drivers to return you to the Peninsula Hotel as most drivers do not speak English and do not recognize the English name Peninsula Hotel. Downloading Google Translate is a must for travelling in Japan. The hotel lobby is beautiful and houses the dining area where you will enjoy delicious breakfast, High Tea, etc. On a cool day, the breeze from the front door can be a little chilling. Service is professional and very friendly. Two thoughts to improve breakfast service: training staff to refill coffee cups and milk and to deliver toast (hot) with the egg order, rather than coming out separately. The rooms are elegantly appointed and extremely well laid out. Our bathroom had two separate and spacious vanities (his and hers). Great make up mirror, great lighting, separate toilet and shower, big soaking tub. There is a large separate make up and closet area. King size bed and linens were very comfortable.

Unfortunately, the bathroom window faced an office building so we never opened it, but it was just something that could not be helped. Prior to arriving at the hotel, I was in contact with the concierge service about itinerary suggestions and they really came through with some great activity recommendations. They even helped us make reservations for a meal at the Kabuki-za. I was very worried about traveling with a baby but the staff at the Peninsula made my stay very easy and enjoyable. They provided great baby amenities (including a baby cot, bath tub, high chair, bib, and baby toiletries) and were very helpful in procuring a babysitter that sat for a few hours while we went to see a Kabuki performance. The housekeeping and room service team is amazing and made sure to leave a beautifully made up room everyday (sometimes twice a day). We couldn't eat at the Kyoto Tsuruya because children under 12 are not allowed but I did order one of their lunch boxes to the room. I highly recommend it! Unfortunately, the mini Cooper was never available when we needed it but taxis are always at the front door. The staff at the door and the concierge is very helpful in figuring out directions and I was provided with a detailed map and information on restaurants and other activities that we would do while at the Peninsula. Like others have mentioned, the lobby is a bit crowded and can be a little loud but did not bother me at all.

Mine did not, but I had an unbelievable suite and I was very happy. Room 2112.We had breakfast every morning. They have great menus, both Japanese and Western. Some of the kids were adventurous and enjoyed the Japanese style and some were happy with eggs and bacon. But they had choices and the quality of the food was superb. You can walk to great retail areas in addition to beautiful parts of the city. We had afternoon tea and it was delicious and served with elegance not seen much anymore. The concierge services were outstanding.The bar upstairs has some spectacular views.Very animated and crowded with good energy.Drinks were fab. Can't miss it.

I asked for a table in the cafe on the main floor, the only air-conditioned space on a muggy August day.

Celebrating their 10th Anniversary this month/year, the Peninsula Tokyo has definitely made a strong impression as a luxury hotel in Tokyo. Staff at the main floor are extremely accommodating for the guests needs right upon arrival, and the condition of the lobby is kept as pristine clean as the first day it opened.Within the rooms, signs of wear & tear are few and sparse (such as chipped wooden corners). Additionally, they definitely have kept up with the times with everything being automated/remotely controlled, and providing additional small details around the room (humidity, outside temp (C/F), wind direction).In terms of setting benchmarks for luxury hotels, the Peninsula Tokyo definitely has set very high bars for room services, such as ice buckets constantly being filled, and turn down service.One of the hotels advantage, may also be its disadvantage: location. Since it's located very near the heart of a shopping district, expect large amounts of foreign tourists there for the sole purpose of buying and sightseeing. My floor had occasional moments of loud chatter out in the hall, where other guests were discussing where to go for the cheapest health supplements.I had a late flight departing the day after my hotel stay, so I decided to request for a late check out. After confirmations were made, I received an email request for more details regarding my flight departure time. Much to my surprise, upon check-in, they told me that I was granted my late check-out of 7PM the following day (my flight was at 11PM). I have to give the Peninsula group a big plus for this benefit, as it would save me the hassle of checking out, going back home, then going to the airport.Overall, I would definitely like to stay in the Peninsula Tokyo (and others around the globe) in the future, and very much so recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a relaxing place to return to after a day in Tokyo.","Tokyo, Japan","TokyoEats128</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",7,5.0

We stayed at the peninsula in Paris last year and while that was a brand new hotel we were still excited to stay at another location in the chain and this one, although 10 years old, did not disappoint. As expected service levels were top notch and every request was tended to with pleasure. From the second we arrived it was a slight drizzle and the service team refused to let me walk outside without being covered with an umbrella. Check in was very smooth. I booked through Amex Fine hotels and resorts and while an upgrade would have been nice it is not guaranteed and the hotel was fully booked. This wasn't a problem as the entry level rooms were a great size - complete with a dressing room and full sized bathroom with double sinks. The bed was extremely comfortable and the room controls were very easy to figure out. It even had a small living space and dining table. The hotel is connected directly to Hibiya station which made getting around very easy and the concierge was very helpful in securing dinner reservations for us. They even got us a table at Sukiyabashi Jiro which is notoriously difficult to get (please note we had to put in the request about 60 days in advance)The breakfast included each morning was great which included a Japanese option, eggs (any way you choose), French toast, a basket of pastries, OJ and coffee. Great way to start the day. We dined at Peter bar on the roof when we arrived which had phenomenal views of the city. We also dined at hei fung terrace and had a delicious lunch - expensive but worth it. Overall the staff were very well trained and spoke perfect English and helped make a great stay excellent. In 5 star hotels the nice decor and interiors are a given but it's the small things that help differentiate. (eg always giving the guests the right of way when walking in the common areas of the hotel - waiters carrying full trays of food would refuse to move until the guest walked passed them first - even if we invited them to move ahead they refused)The champagne and chocolates in our room to celebrate our honeymoon was also a nice touch!Looking forward to our next stay at a Peninsula hotel","Toronto, Canada","lornem2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",7,5.0

I was most impressed with the smart design, every detail seemed anticipated and accounted for - there was nothing that I imagined that wasn't already thought about and addressed - even the flat full length wall mirror that could be adjusted to a 3-D mirror - so smart.Everything was clean and fresh in aroma - room, public areas, restaurants, even the cigar bar. The location was superb, across from the Emperial gardens for touring or walking and easy walk to Ginza for shopping and dining.I enjoyed the well appointed gym daily, alone at 4:30 am each morning (jet lag issues). Didn't use the spa or pool, but peeked in at both, which were quite lovely. There was an outdoor terrace adjacent to the pool, which I wished that I had more time to explore.We had breakfast each morning in the lobby restaurant (included with our Amex FHR program) and service was swift, warm, and accommodating. The menu was varied enough to allow me to try and enjoy something different each day. We enjoyed cocktails most nights in Peter's on the 24th floor. I liked the environment and the staff there was excellent, but I do wish they had more quarters in the hotel for relaxation.Everyone, check-in staff, transportation, concierge, housekeeping, gym, made us feel welcomed, comfortable, appreciated, and cared for - No snobbery - very different from any US experience that I've had at a Peninsula.

It just oozes that old-school Japanese class and luxury that you really cannot experience anywhere else. Every time I travel to Tokyo I make sure to fit in a stay at the Peninsula. It is like you are transported back in time, it is almost magical.If you're looking for modern, sleek Tokyo then you will be disappointed at the Peninsula. But if you appreciate the old school glam, you will not be disappointed.The location is great, close to all the luxury shopping. They have complimentary limousine services for suite guests. We hitched a ride on the mini coopers a few times, but we also got to ride on the Rolls Royce Phantom a few times too which was a lot of fun. Its an experience being dropped off at Tsukiji market in a rolls royce!This time our suite was high-up and corner suite view of the palaces. I love the layout of their suite. It is discreet so that if you have guests over at your suite for tea, the bedroom, dressing rooms and master bathrooms are tucked away so that guests feel comfortable. The beds are fluffy, the amenities are Oscar de la Renta. The ceilings have the traditional tatami wood patterns but the room itself is in a way mid-century modern too. Its very artistic and architectural. Plenty of charging ports everywhere.Every day we were treated to fresh juices and the daily paper delivered to our suite. We had breakfast one day at the lobby which was included in our suite price. Their pastries are just TO DIE FOR. I mean to be fair, Japan has some amazing pastries but sometimes I dream of the Peninsula's croissants and danishes while I am back home in Toronto...... The Chinese breakfast was also quite nice with the congee and condiments and dimsum. It seemed no matter the cuisine they always got it pretty spot-on. Service was spectacular every single day every single encounter. They really know how to take care of their guests to make sure you are very comfortable. We had some intricate orders for our dine-in service (i.e. I was jetlagged and wanted plain congee and hot water on the side) and no matter what we ask for it is completed meticulously and perfectly done. Our Rimowa luggage wheel broke when we checked in very late at night and we asked the hotel if they could call Rimowa to fix the wheel. We were expecting this to be done sometime the next day or the day after, but literally the hotel called us in our room (discreetly, after precisely 15 minutes to give us time to unwind but not to fall asleep) to ask us if we wanted it to be done right away that night they would do so. I mean, that kind of service you cannot find anywhere in the world!!!!! The hotel totally took care of everything from scheduling the maintenance person to come and fix the luggage, by noon the next day we had fresh wheels on our Rimowa.The concierge at The Peninsula is the only one we trust when we are in Tokyo. Their recommendations for michelin star sushi and for kobe steak have been spot on. We are foodies and we tried venturing into our own finds and we were always disappointed. The concierge suggestions have become our go-to. We even asked for a 'cheap, casual yummy okonomiyaki place"" and of course, we were not disappointed this place was awe-some.At dinnertime they have live music playing in the foyer and their dinner was also pretty spectacular. We went back a year later and the remember our names and ask us if they could do anything better this time to please let them know.I love the Peninsula, I will not hesitate to go back and I always do try every time I go to Tokyo.","Toronto, Canada","Jaime K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",25,5.0

More electronics and bedside controls than you can imagine. Huge bathroom with 2 big separate vanities and a huge walkin closet. Many nice architectural features that gives the hotel a special feeling. Food was excellent. Fitness center was only ok - too many tread mills and not enough machines.

Very clean city, citizens dress very nice, no smoking in any public area including city streets. No loud music from cars, no horns, no sirens, absolutely quiet.

Restaurants were all amazing, expensive but decor and service best anywhere in the world. Everything about hotel inclusive of 5 star staff makes this hotel a gem. We booked the hotel transfers through hotel and the RollsRoyce was an expensive treat. We used an inclusive guide for an all day tour followed by the next day did the fish market tour as well.

Slight draw back is the lobby lounge that serves all day snacks, and including breakfast. The atmosphere can be rather loud and chaotic with guests largely drawn from neighboring countries and SE Asia. Also, service such as refills can be slow due to the large volumes of customers.

I really can't say that enough. The room we got was for our honeymoon, a deluxe corner suite with a view of the Imperial Palace and the local park. They had multi-voltage plugs, and *at the time* - I believe they've removed this feature and it sucks, because it made the place even better value - had unlimited laundry and dry cleaning in the suite, all provided through a discreet cupboard you'd put the clothes in and hit a button on, and then someone would come get them and replace them. This was great, and if it's gone I'm sorry but I may be one of the types of people who got it removed by abusing it by putting in all my dirty clothes all the time. It ruled. I'm sorry.I'm gonna dig at something quickly which seems petulant, but it was poorly explained. It says ""Complimentary non-alcoholic beverages from the mini-bar"" but what they mean is ""one refill."" Any more than that and they'll charge you for them. Also, if you order a soda through room service it's 1000 yen, so $9, which is hilarious. We were picked up and dropped off at Hineda using the quite expensive Tesla Model S (their most affordable, believe it or not) car service. It's expensive, but includes porters who pick up your stuff, put it in the car, and then check you *in in your room* which is very nice after 11 hours of flying. This means they sit at your table and do everything versus at the front desk. Japanese hotels also require your passport, which is jarring but it's necessary. They also fax you stuff to your room when they can't get to you, which is weird but funny. Either way it was really nice to sit down and do this in my room after the flight considering the time difference.The hotel is gorgeous - constantly playing live music, with a great restaurant right when you get in. Room service is expensive but high quality, again as you'd expect. The staff are constantly desperate to help - they will do anything they can - and when they made a mistake on an order they rectified it immediately. They mostly speak great English, too, and the transportation desk will gladly get you a street cab and tell them, even if it's somewhere really specific, where you're going. When we visited a restaurant in an odd location they managed to sit there and tell them where to go. Better yet, when we had reservations they made for us, they printed out a guide to hand the cabbie if we were out at the time, and provide you with Japanese cards to hand to cab drivers that say (in Japanese) how to get to the hotel, and please take me there. They got me into Sushi Jiro, narisawa (we actually couldn't go and they took care of that), and Gyu-an. They made sure I had anything I needed, they helped with shopping, they were just great. You're walking distance from stores, both expensive and inexpensive, and most cab drivers know where it is. It's also pretty quiet.The Wifi was the only bad thing, and it seems strange to dedicate a line to this, but come on. It was really really slow. There were no upgrade options. Just...yeah, I don't know why. They didn't have a bluray player, but that's kinda small potatoes.The location is fantastic too - Ginza has all sorts of shops, you're in walking distance of subway stations, they'll find you a way to get to anywhere and answer any questions you have. The singular bad experience we had was bizarrely when we asked to go to Tokyo station, and 3 people literally didn't know where to take us. I don't know what happened.Price-wise, this place was really good for the money. My final bill was cheaper than expected, which happens almost never at hotels. Furthermore, if they can help they will. If you have a problem, they will come and fix it. Even if you can't get the weird opulence of unlimited laundry, if you're going to Tokyo, go here. It's great. Romantic, quiet in the room, well-placed, and luxurious. And, honestly, cheaper than 5 star hotels you'd find in the USA for way better.

The food was good, but not particularly delicious - I would have expected a bit more. (2) The hotel is using the lobby space to operate another restaurant. As a result, there is no lobby to speak of where one could meet up or wait for others to arrive.

Rooms / suites facing the Imperial Palace are the best as they provide beautiful views, although you do get the afternoon sun. This is a rather old hotel, but quite well maintained. The lobby is stunning, but could have been much better if the restaurant for breakfast was placed in a separate area. Check in was efficient. Staff at the reception and concierge were very polite and helpful in general. I booked a sort of junior suite facing the Imperial Palace Gardens. It was spacious and had sufficient space for my needs. The bed was very comfortable. Bathroom etc was spacious enough. Some wear and tear was showing, but nothing serious. Housekeeping was consistent and reliable. Breakfast was underwhelming. On the first day, they redirected me to the basement eatery, which was very cramped and served a very average buffet. On the other days, I ate in the lobby restaurant, which was ok but the selection was very limited. The gym and swimming pool (indoor) was impressive.

Front desk - upon check in we realised that our agent had made some critical mistakes during the booking and we were almost left with no room to stay in. It was not the hotel's fault but they still went out of their way to assist us and in the end they managed to settle us into the rooms without any hassle. It was really going above and beyond what was expected of their service. We were very impressed.2. Location - the hotel is conveniently located within walking distance from the busy streets of Ginza yet is located just far enough off the side so that you can enjoy a quiet night right next to the imperial gardens and palace. The hotel also sits right on top of the elevator exit of Hibiya station so travelling by metro to anywhere in Tokyo is really easy. 3. Ease of shopping - as with many other 5 star hotels in the area, most of the department stores in Ginza offer a free same day delivery of your purchases directly to your hotel. No need to carry those heavy shopping bags around town! 4. Room - needless to say, their rooms are very spacious and the layout is efficient. There are a lot of different functions available for just the curtains and mood lighting, and my daughter had a blast experimenting with all those buttons. The nail dryer next to the dressing table was a nice touch too for emergency touch ups and fixes.5. Baby amenities - we were welcomed with a basket of amenities for our baby, which included soap, lotion, bib and a towel. The crib they provided was already equipped with a bumper, small pillow and mini duvet. It was one of the most luxurious cribs we have come across so far. And onto their flaws: 1. Inconsistent housekeeping - what bothered me the most was their inconsistencies with their housekeeping standard. Though towels and bed linens were changed everyday, they did not bother to organise anything in the room like most other hotels did. Things were left scattered everywhere and not even placed aside nicely. Perhaps they were too careful not to touch my things but I just found it a bit odd for a 5 star hotel. My biggest disappointment was the last night of our stay, where I returned to my room completely exhausted to find that the crib had been left in a mess! The bumpers were off, duvet out of its cover and bed sheets undone. I was too exhausted at that point to call housekeeping to tidy up and just wanted to quickly put my baby to bed. In the end I had to fix the bed myself. 2. Non transparent charges - we tend to do a lot of shopping in Japan and almost always end up having to pack a box or two of our clothes to ship home. The boxes would be weighed by the concierge and we would know exactly what to pay for shipping. We would also have several shipping options to choose from (by sea, air, express courier etc). However this was not the case at the Peninsula. We were asked to sign a pre-approval to charge our credit card after they had figured out the charges and we had no choice on what type of freighter to use. We were also charged an extra 1500 yen handling charge for each shipment on top of the shipping fees. With other hotels we did not have to pay this extra handling fee. 3. Not enough manpower at the front entrance - I have, on several occasions found the front entrance completely without staff. We had to hail our own cabs without any assistance. This was in the afternoon. The Peninsula definitely has its ups and downs but I would probably stay somewhere else next time we're in Tokyo. With the price they're charging we definitely have many other options. ","Hong Kong, China","coolblue22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",26,3.0

We also agree with some of the other comments here that it is a shame the lobby area is filled with the restaurant and doesn't offer any lounge space. The staff were very helpful but did cause one hiccup for us. We had requested the concierge to make two very hard to get dinner reservations for us and they came through with what we had requested. When we checked in they gave us our confirmations with maps to each. On the second night we could not find the restaurant and after almost an hour searching we discovered they had given us the old address and the restaurant had relocated a year earlier. We eventually got to the right place and the restaurant was able to accommodate us despite being so late but it really caused a fair amount of stress for us. When we got back to our room that night there was a nice bottle of wine waiting for us which helped us get over our frustrations.

The pool is impressive. I loved that the lobby had welcome music every evening. The only thing I can say is beware of the hidden service charge. The rate of the room is not a flat rate, there is a service charge on top of the room. One thing that other hotel rooms do that Peninsula does not is the extra something special during turndown service. For example a few chocolates or fruit.

We've stayed at this hotel multiple times in the basic Deluxe room, Executive Suite, and the large Deluxe suite. Location of this hotel is amazing. 10 minute walk from the glamorous Ginza and 5 minute walk from Ramen Alley for late night eats. Tons of eating and shopping options all within a few minutes of the hotel. The lobby is magnificent and always busy with people eating lunch or having tea. The Pros: All the rooms are well thought out. Screens informing you of outdoor temperature, all electronic blinds/shades, coffee machine, hot water maker. Decent closet space and good sized bathrooms even for the basic rooms. What you lose with the basic rooms is size and view (usually will be looking into another building). Basic room is bed connected to a living room area with a TV. No separate TV near the bed. Executive and Premium suites have a separate living room area with a large TV. Similar layout between the Executive and Premium Suites, the difference being the Premium Suites have gigantic living room and massive dressing room and closet area. The Cons: Service slightly varied with different level rooms. While staying in the deluxe rooms I requested a hot water maker, a basic amenity included in practically every hotel in Asia but strangely missing at the Peninsula. I was told that they had none in the hotel and would either need to call room service or use the coffee maker which was extremely awkward and slow. When I requested a hot water maker while staying in the Premium Suites, we got one delivered quickly along with fruit and juice every evening. Conclusion: I would not consider deluxe rooms to be a good value at the Peninsula. Rooms are not that much bigger than other cheaper and good quality hotels and you pay a premium to stay in a room with no view. If you can splurge for a more expensive room, the experience is quite different and the rooms are magnificent, especially those overlooking Imperial Palace.","Los Angeles, California","TravelInEase</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",60,5.0

Waited to check in at 6pm. Waited 20 minutes after check in for unexplained reason before being shown to room. Staff is on auto-pilot. All very robotic, with little authenticity or warmth. Food on room service breakfast was pretty, but flavorless. More attention paid to appearance than taste.Pool are was too crowded on two checks, and full of loud kids. Fitness room is poorly lit, and has limited equipment, including no rowing machine.And had to wait in line for 20 minutes to check out.When paying so much per night we expect more than you'd get at a Hilton or Intercontinental.

I divided my time among the Mandarin Oriental and Pennisula Hotel. I stayed in suites at both Hotels. I was surprised at the lack of service of the Pennisula. When your spending over 1k a day for a room you expect top notch quality service. Here are some points:Check in - I had to wait 25 minutes. Then no one escorted me to my room. They just gave me the keys. New Year's Eve dinner - horrible. Slow service. Bad food and everyone was CHAIN SMOKING at the bar in low level ceiling room. I felt like I was at an airport Marriott. The experience was so bad I left dinner. It ruined my New Years and I also believe I got sick from the trick. Taxi - the Pennisula has a custom taxi but please be where you must order in advance. After leaving New Year's Eve I needed a ride. The car sat outside butt they would not make it worthwhile The Lobby Lounge - it is very strange that the entrance has no where to relax and sit. People enjoy. A cocktail and to read, people watch or meet friends and family. There is zero room minus a restaurant. When I met a business pattern we decided to talk in driveway because there was no space and we didn't want to order a meal. They must fix his asap. Once you realize they have no rooftop bar minus the smoke filled room, the situation gets worse The positive - a very nice pool spa area. So nice in fact I ordered room service here because it is the best place to eat in hotel.

Last year we are in the Chinese restaurant and Peter (the restaurant on the top floor) as well as spending a lot of time in the cocktail bar gazing at the view.

The first one was Shangri-La, the second one The Peninsula and the third one Mandarin Oriental. We stayed at all hotels for three days, a total of nine days. I booked all hotels through GrandLuxuryHotels and have been very pleased by their services.So the second one was the Peninsula and we looked very much forward to our stay. To make a long story short: We were disappointed. Even though the location near Imperior’s Garden ist great, we never felt at home. Entering the hotel, the hotel lobby is packed with people eating on tables all day long. Luckily for us, restaurant Peter on the 24th floor was open for breakfast during Christmas and New Eve; normally breakfast is served in the lobby… Service was so so and we cannot understand, that management allows (American) guests to join breakfast in their sweaty outfit, right after running: really disgusting. I'm a passionate runner myself, but would never allow myself to join any meal in a inappropriate dress. By the way: we booked a Deluxe Parkpark Premier Room, but looked directly into a huge, fully lit office building. After complaining, we have been told, this is park view. Strange. As a matter of fact, after our complaint, they just renamed these rooms to “premier rooms” with a new description: “views overlooking Tokyo skyline” :-)...Maybe I'm too harsh with my comments. The Peninsula is not a bad hotel. But the services provided at Shangri-La and Mandarin Oriental are much better and the rooms more cozy and luxurious for the same price.

It is ideally located in walking distance to the Ginna area as well as the Tokyo Station area and Imperial Gardens and has metro access from the basement to everywhere else. The rooms are lovely and comfortable, contemporary but not starkly minimalist, filled with technological touches which are actually useful as opposed to the trend towards technology for technology's sake. They are well designed with a large separate dressing area that is very helpful when there is more than one person getting ready at one time. The bath is spacious as well and well appointed. What truly stands out is the service which was consistently excellent. From the front desk, to room service, to housekeeping, the bell staff and the concierge, all were warm, helpful and exceedingly professional.

It is flawless in its hardware and amenities. The room is spacious and clean. The layout is excellent. Kids are definitely welcome here as our little love terrorist was treated with his own teddy bear slipper, bath toy, teddy bear shaped bath sponge, kid's tooth brush with tooth paste, organic body wash, shampoo and lotion, goody bag filled with stationery, cookies, etc. Not sure what it will be in other seasons, but there was a stuffed snowman in a gift bag there welcoming our little one. The kid's breakfast is served in a very cute tray. The Peninsula Tokyo is very conveniently located. It is within walking distance to Ginza and Hibiya subway station, three stations away from Tsukiji Market. Restaurants and eateries of all sorts are all there within easy walking distance. However, there are a few improvements that I can see needed to perfect the experience. The check-in process is not as efficient as it could be especially when compared to other hotels. The staff are very friendly and pleasant. Yet, there was only 3 staff on duty during rush hour - check-in hours to service the line-up that was out in the check-in area which is tucked at the back on your left when you entered the hotel. You need to pass through the dining area first. Observing it on a different day, it could be because the staff has to escort the guests to their rooms and created an illusion of insufficient staffing for the rush hours. In any case, the entire process should be reviewed. The breakfast serving areas can be confusing. We had a later breakfast the next day we checked-in at around 9:30am, we were directed to the basement cafe for breakfast. The following morning we were up early and ready for breakfast at 8:15am. We went straight down to the basement cafe for breakfast and found that the restaurant was vacant with no staff. We went to the back preparatory area and asked if they were serving breakfast. We were told we had to go up to the lobby for breakfast.

In summary, for the hotels in the Nihonbashi / Marunouchi / Ginza area I would rank the Peninsula behind the Mandarin and Four Seasons but ahead of others like the Shangri La, Tokyo Station, Imperial and Palace Hotels (although the Palace is comparable).The hotel location is fantastic. Right on the edge of the Imperial Palace and Ginza. It is also a straight shot from this location to other touristy areas such as Roppongi or Shinjuku/Shibuya. I was traveling for business (although my partner was with me) and it is also very well located right by the CBD and Tokyo Station. Overall, I would say it is the best located hotel in Tokyo for both business and tourism. The rooms are nicely laid out and have a good feel. The bed is extremely comfortable. The dressing room and bathroom are nicely laid out and the general dark wooden decor has a nice homely feel. No a modern or particularly new feel to it, but nice.The pool and gym are also very good. The top floor restaurant has a nice view out over the imperial palace but a bit of a shame that the bar area doesn't share this view. The bar area is extremely smokey (which is normal for Tokyo) and the only time I went up it was too crowded for me to get a seat. The restaurant downstairs is good for breakfast but has a very limited menu for lunch. I was rushing off to meeting and wanted a quick sandwich or burger but there were hardly any choices. I was a bit surprised by this as on my last visit I recall more options.There were a couple of slight annoyances. I messaged the concierge to ask that they help me arrange a few things and the response time was very bad. I ended up speaking to the head concierge regarding this, and from then on she was extremely helpful and gave us very useful tips that would have taken a lot of time to put together, so ultimately everything was very good, but only after complaining.I had also requested a King Sized Room, but had a twin allocated when I arrived. I took some time to get this sorted, and ultimately I was able to get a great room, so I was appreciative of the front desk staff's patience with my initial annoyance at not getting the type of room I requested.

The large bathrooms and large dressing rooms are a luxury that few hotels offer, especially in a city such as Tokyo where space is a great premium. The service in the hotel is impeccable. The food in the hotel is amazing. I love the room service be it dim sum or wagyu beef hamburger, everything is generally perfect. I have only a couple of minor comment of concern: in the past the hotel has offered fresh Japanese fruit in the room on a daily basis. When I first started coming here the hotel had fresh juices and fresh fruits in the room. This amenity was truly one of the best aspects of the hotel. We looked forward to returning home each day to the fresh Japanese seasonal fruits. However, I have just learned on this visit that the hotel has stopped this amenity!!!! I am so disappointed. This is one of the small but important things that set this hotel apartment from the many other great choices in Tokyo. Aman, Mandarin, and others are always there, but I have until today always picked the Peninsula because I know my experience will be impeccable and also enhanced by the fruits and juices and comforts that only a great hotel will provide. I am concerned about this change and it is these little things that can make all the difference. I discussed this change with management and was told this change was made recently.

Location is superb. From B2 of the hotel, there is a direct passageway to the Hibiya subway station, which is served by Tokyo Metro Hibiya line, Tokyo Metro Chiyoda line and the Toei Mita Line. The Hibiya station is also connected by underground passageway to the Yurakucho station. With this connectivity, there is no need to brave the elements when one needs to use the Tokyo subway system. The Chiyoda line gets you directly and quickly to popular spots like Akasaka, Omotesando and Harajuku, while the Hibiya line gets you to Roppongi and, via transfer to Ginza line, Asakusa.The hotel is located on a corner facing the Imperial Palace and Hibiya Park, and within walking distance of Ginza and the so-called ""Golden Triangle"" comprising Hibiya, Marunouchi, and Yurakucho. Request for park view room especially one with a view of the Imperial Palace gardens.b) Room size and decor. The room was quite sizable by Tokyo standards. The decor is warm and soothing with the use of a lot of wood. Bathroom is spacious (liked the placement of the basins -one each on opposite sides of the bathroom), and so is the dressing room. Note: the high tech touch controls for lights and curtains may take some getting use to - especially for some older folk.c) Service - When it comes to misplaced articles, Peninsula's housekeeping is very efficient and responsive. Had misplaced a scarf during my stay. This was couriered to my home after a brief correspondence with their housekeeping coordinator. The concierge service is also quite commendable. They responded fairly promptly to our requests for restaurant and theatre bookings, and made suggestions for alternatives when our original choices were unavailable.

We were delayed and arrived late on the first night and I had sent them a quick email before boarding my delayed flight to ask if they could change my dinner booking. They had promptly checked the email and changed the booking and replied my email by the time I was on the plane! All the restaurant bookings we had made in Tokyo were printed out and maps of their locations prepared for us as soon as we arrived. Not only was the service of the concierge helpful, friendly and efficient; service at the hotel front door and reception was also flawless. Needless to say they all spoke perfect English. A helpful concierge to make bookings and recommendations is so important in a place like Tokyo, where no one speaks English to tourists! I also tried out the spa one afternoon and booked a massage. The spa was nice and clean, massage was good, service was good.. Everything you would expect in a 5 star hotel spa. Again, nothing to complain about. Only thing is the hotel lobby feels a bit cramped, as the lobby restaurant/lounge is on both sides as you enter the hotel so it doesn't leave much room for anything else.. So people waiting in the lobby all sit on two benches or stand around.. So the lobby doesn't quite feel as 5 star as it should. Nonetheless this doesn't affect the calibre of the hotel services and facilities of course. Location of this hotel is also fairly convenient- just steps away from the subway; and a short walk into the restaurant/ shopping district of Ginza. Other major shopping districts (e.g. Shibuya/ Shinjuku) is just a 15-20 min cab ride away. I would stay here again and would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling in Tokyo looking for 5 star service with no disappointments.

The curtains, lights and thermostat were all controlled by a remote next to the bed.

The staff was always plentiful and helpful. Everyone spoke english and we had no problems communicating. We asked the concierge desk to assist us with a dining reservation and they went above and beyond to be of service. We debated staying at various luxury hotels in Tokyo and we chose The Peninsula for it's location, which did not disappoint. Ginza is an excellent neighborhood to base yourself in for exploring Tokyo. I would compare it to staying on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. There is high end shopping everywhere. Even if that isn't your taste, the hotel is walking distance from Tokyo Station and the Imperial Gardens. We walked to pretty much every meal we had during our stay.

From the bedside phone, you can control TV, electric shades and climate/temperature. The room had a HUGE walk in closet, and a very large bathroom with a large soaker tub and a walk-in shower.

The Peninsula Tokyo gives me the urge to go back and downgrade each of those experiences because they cannot compare. Every single aspect of the Peninsula Tokyo, including the price, is premium. No detail is ignored and everything about the hotel is laid out in a practical and spectacular fashion. When you arrive, the first impression is a stunning lobby with giant art installations. Despite the art installations, the lobby maintained a clean look and was not cluttered. Around the corner, there is a reception area where check in occurs. I booked the hotel using Amex Fine Hotels and was explained my added benefits. A porter took my bag to the room and showed me how to use the extensive technology in the hotel room.As an aside, I typically find ""smart"" hotel rooms annoying and not very functional. Half the buttons dont work and you typically cant even open the shades without just ripping them open. However, every switch, button or knob in the Peninsula Tokyo was clearly labeled and very intuitive. Everything was easy to use. The Deluxe Room is sort of like a junior suite in that the main area had a bed, but also a couch and small breakfast table and desk. There was a giant walk in closet that had all the accoutrement anyone would need. Finally, the bathroom was spectacular including a tv in the mirror and the famed Japanese toilet that also served as a bidet. How this has not caught on in the United States is a mystery that needs to be immediately investigated. This hotel is also connected directly to the train station so getting around is easy. The concierge is very helpful and we used them to set up an English speaking tour that made Tokyo very accessible to a first timer. I am a huge fan of this hotel and would love to return at some point. Highly recommend.

You're two blocks from the Ginza, and two blocks from multiple subway stops, and across the street from the glorious Imperial Gardens. If you don't want to pay high prices for hotel food (although the food in The Peninsula is predictably excellent), walk outside, make a left turn and walk two blocks toward the elevated train tracks, and underneath you'll find blocks of amazing and affordable restaurants, some holes in the wall, some more upscale, some offering sidewalk tables, giving you enough choices to eat for a month. And, if you just want a snack and don't even want to think about looking in the mini-bar (always good advice), there's a 7-11 a block away, which itself is fun adventure in Tokyo. The Concierge desk is super helpful, suggesting good tour companies, and another time arranging a visit to a doctor for a quickly resolved medical issue. I know some hotels are ranked higher, but to do so must be like comparing Da Vinci to Michelangelo. I had a ""standard"" room on the 22nd floor, and it that's ""standard,"" the better rooms must be Buckingham Palace. I know rates vary depending on who you book with, but whatever you pay, once in the room you'll tell yourself it's worth every penny. The staff is friendly, helpfully spoke decent English, and would do anything and everything. As you can tell, I have a lot of things to say about The Peninsula Tokyo, all good. I paid a lot of money for the experience and instead of regretting it, I can't wait to go back.",Los Angeles,"Journey802960</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",38,5.0

My friend receieved a kind of ""warning"" letter from the hotel after she tried to change her reservation second time.

First the food. I don't like to have my breakfast in the lobby entrance. Secondly it is difficult to eat after 10 pm (only room service is available). The Peter bar has a great view but the deco is horrible and the seats uncomfortable. The waiters bother you every 5 mn to ask you if you want another glass. Believe me when I want another glass you'll know it...Finally I was very unhappy with the organisation of the hotel at the entrance regarding taxis. One morning I had to take a taxi and it was raining. It looked very disorganised. Everyone was run ing towards the taxi, the staff were run ing around the cars and it seemed that every body was overtaking me. There was no queue. They should do waht they do in Singapore or HK regarding taxi queues. I must say that the staff were really nice though.

Lovely and cozy, modern yet not too modern for a hotel. The rooms are spacious enough to not give you a cramped feeling, with walk in closets and store suitcases, the same room had a dressing table.. So one doesn't fret about space.The power source is good and powerful so my hair appliances worked with ease and just as well as back home. Now what is not so good, the fact that there doesn't appear to be a lobby.. The breakfast area is the first thing you see when you enter the hotel and I don't like the fact that the entrance smells of food upon entering. At night it is incredibly difficult to get a meal, the last order at the restaurant/lobby area is 8, this includes tea.. My home country is 6 hours ahead, so my internal clock had to adjust incredibly fast in order for me to make sure I have enough food in me to last me the day. The room service menu is also limited past 10pm.. There is a bar area upstairs with a lovely view, but there was something lacking in the ambiance of the place, primarily that the restaurant section was closed so it was simply a bar area... During the day the hotel is situated on ginza and so there are a lot of things one can do, the back door leads to more high end shops and he main door will take you down to an abundance of other shops/restaurants/cafes.. At night the area is too abandoned as it is in a business area, so all in all, it is a good hotel but definitely has the potential to be great. If only the lobby and restaurants remained open a little later.. So that despite the haunted like streets at night.. It would feel like there is life back at the hotel at least.

Location is good and they accommodated an early 1pm check in for me with no fuss. Concierge recommended some good restaurants.But nonetheless a few observations on the negative side:- Nearly twice as many rooms as the MO ... it was full during my stay and it did feel very busy ... I saw queues to check in at one point, although there wasn't a queue when I checked in ... and to be fair there are legions of staff on hand - Lobby a bit of a disappointment with limited atmosphere because they have crammed it full of breakfast tables .... feels quite small, functional, and a touch dated with all the wood furniture- The spark for writing this review, which is something that always maddens me with hotels which have over-geared themselves to the walk-in crowd ... despite being a paying guest I was denied a table seat in the bar. To be fair the maitre d' was very good about it but the fact remained I had to wait for a walk-in customer to leave if I wanted to sit down on a proper chair. And you could tell it was geared for walk-ins because getting there meant going back down to the lobby and taking a separate lift ... you can't even get in there without starting at street level. A real pity, as it means as a guest there was no sanctuary; I am sat in my room right now writing this when I would prefer to be reading my book in the bar with a bit of ambience/atmosphere. Top top hotels in Europe always keep a few bar tables free for guests, as I have learned both to my pleasure and frustration as a guest and as a walk-in. Not so at the Pen in Tokyo. All in all it must be a very commercially successful hotel, but I would have been a bit disappointed if I'd paid my my own money to stay here, and had no better treatment than if I'd walked in off the street for a quick beer.

The location is great, within walking distance of the main shops in Ginza as well as the palace grounds and next to a couple of metro lines (Hibiya station is right there). Check-in was very efficient and the gentleman did everything he could to accommodate my request for a room of a high floor. The room was fine. Bathroom was large with a tub and separate shower. Also there was an illy espresso machine and tea making facilities. The room was definitely a little dated (e.g., chenille covered loveseat that looked a little worn), but the bed was comfortable and we had a good view of the imperial grounds.There were, however, a couple of things that did not meet our expecations. There was a pool, which was nice and large. But there was a requirement to have a swim cap (provided by the hotel) even if you have your hair up and do not expect to dip your head in the water (I had never seen that before in a 5 star hotel, including others in Tokyo). More importantly, we had several pieces of misinformation from the concierge (1) we were told the wrong lunch hours for a restaurant (2) we were told that a restaurant we were going to for dinner took credit cards but in fact only took cash (we were fortunate to have taken out enough earlier that day) and this was a restaurant with a hefty $300+ per person price tag! and (3) we had the address in Japanese of a sushi restaurant recommended by a friend. The restaurant was located in a building with other establishments. We were told the wrong number of the location within the building so ended up eating at a different sushi restaurant (2 stalls down) instead of the one we had wanted to try. The one we went to was good but not the one we had wanted to try so was very disappointing...I would stay at the Tokyo Peninsula again, but just wanted to note the few things that made our stay imperfect given our expectations of the Peninsula hotels.","New York City, New York","MiffysPillowBook</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",84,4.0

It was perfectly positioned for our office in Marunouchi, and offered a wonderful oasis from the busy shopping district of Ginza, which is a mere stone's throw hence. For those daring enough to eschew a taxi, the railway and underground connections are excellent, as is access to the Imperial Palace. The rooms are extremely well appointed, with both a free standing bath and separate shower, with controls for TV, radio and telephone accessible from the bath tub (a wonderful extravagance, and by no means inconvenient!). There is a dressing room, allowing one to work and dress in a separate environment to one's sleeping chamber, which is again a fabulous luxury.The quality of the fixtures and fittings is superb, as one might expect, with strong emphasis on the use of natural materials.

That said, the hotel feels a tad inflexible...forcing the guest to conform to the way it wants to run. This might just be the difference between the relatively large Peninsula and more boutique-size properties in the city (like Aman and Four Seasons). The Peninsula pool is one of the nicest in the city. However, the requirement to wear bathing caps (regardless of hair length) is odd and detracts from the experience. Similarly, staff lifeguards do not allow guests enough privacy (they seem to be constantly hovering and observing--even though they are perfectly friendly). The gym is on the small side and has no windows--the Mandarin and Aman in Tokyo have much nicer ones. Finally, use of the spa facilities (such as steam and sauna) is reserved solely for treatment guests (here too I prefer Four Seasons, Mandarin and Aman). Food is quite good. Particularly enjoyed the Chinese restaurant (which has a Michelin star) and the views from the rooftop Peter Restaurant are great (although the environment is a bit cheesy). The only real negative is the lobby lounge--one of the main breakfast venues. It has no windows and is cut straight down the middle by the main circulation between main entrance and front desk. It just isn't a space that anyone would want to spend time in (if booking a breakfast-inclusive rate see if it allows for room service). The rooms are thoughtfully laid out and have great electronic touches (electronic draperies, humidity settings, mood lighting, etc). Views of the imperial gardens are superb. If using an AmEX Fine Hotel's and Resorts rate, it is interesting to note that the Peninsula is one of the few properties in Tokyo that allows for upgrades between room and suite categories. For example, unlike the Four Seasons and Mandarin, you can book a high category room and upgrade to a suite....of upgrade from a jr, suite to a deluxe suite. The deluxe suites are particularly nice corner rooms and have spectacular imperial garden views. The only downside is that the bedrooms are slightly small and the bathrooms are identical to a regular room at the hotel.",New York,"Liam A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",63,5.0

The hotel lobby is warm, it has a special atmosphere and music artists play classical music live, hidden in a small retreat one floor higher, almost like not wanting to be seen but welcoming the guests with warm music.The room was very clean, with a creative design and an artistic touch, the view was also very nice, being able to see Marunouchi and the Imperial Palace from the 21st floor. My only problem was the breakfast, which was a bit over 10000 yen for 2 persons or about 15% relative to the price of the room. I just found that to be too expensive, for a pot fo coffee or tea, an egg, some bacon and a toast. For that money one can have a super-dinner in Tokyo for sure. But then again, eating breakfast at the Peninsula maybe means just this, a ""naturally"" overpriced breakfast. The bar at the top of the hotel, called Peter, was also very nice, but one gin & tonic is about 17 US dollars.

It is unacceptable for a five stars hotel. Especially when there is nowhere comfortable for the guest to wait as the lobby is uninviting and stuck in a corner so they'll have you wait on a bench in front of the elevators.

In 2015, it feels cheap and outdated.3- Confusion from the concierge who left me an angsty message on my phone about a restaurant reservation that we had clearly cancelled.

The rooms are excellent with small touches e.g. ice in the ice bucket and the service is impeccable. One downside to the hotel is the limited and fixed choice for breakfast e.g. you cannot have 2 days of Japanese food as it is nearly the same. The location of the hotel is very central as a hub for 3 metro lines and the JR line as well. The hotel is surrounded by both branded shops as well as Japanese department stores which have excellent food sections in the basement. Great place to get snacks and even full meals. Around the hotel one can find 3 star michelin restaurants and really local good value places under the railway arches e.g. noodles and yakitori - skewered chicken.",,TravelandEatAsYouGo,61,4.0

After having seen what a fantastic job Peninsula hotels do in Europe (Paris), US (Chicago) or Asia (Hong Kong) I do blame myself for choosing this property in Tokyo (moreover that Tokyo has so many other choices / Mandarin, Grand Hyatt and 4S,...).Today, and it is a busy public holiday in Japan, it felt like checking into a Venetian or Ceasar Palace hotel in Vegas. Lack of refreshment or dining options in the afternoon. We eventually satisfied our hunger in a basement level bistro next door (which is fine but is it what you expect when staying at hotels like this that gives you ZERO in-house alternatives). Service is indeed attentative but I must say the overall impression is so far mediocre, Marriott-like yet priced as Peninsula.I feel very disappointed .. lets see how this trip turns out (3 more nights to go...)","Prague, Czech Republic","Milan P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Prague, Czech Republic</strong>",81,1.0

One major flaw in the hotel is that they DO NOT have a LOBBY. Its very shocking to arrive at a hotel such as Peninsula and to find out there is no LOBBY. You enter the hotel through their restaurant where they serve breakfast . I did not understand this concept and neither did I appreciate it. We had booked rooms inclusive of breakfast. However, when we went down for breakfast they informed us that we could only eat worth 4900 yen. That's all. I found this very inconvenient as they charged me over USD500 per night per room but limit my breakfast to just 4900 yen. I had to actually calculate the cost of each item from the menu I was ordering so as not to exceed 4900 yen.

They have never let us down, not even once. I do have a new story to tell though. We were here with two kids (under 10), and it was a real rush to check out one day so we accidently left over the equivalent in $1000 cash on the desk! I was almost immediately informed of this later by the hotel who kept it for us until we returned a day or two later. They found it before we figured out we had left it. This is truly a testament to not just the incredibly honest and helpful staff but also the Japanese culture and people. I can't imagine many other places where something like this could happen. The service remains outstanding, the food is great, the rooms are perfect, the housekeeping standards are the highest I have ever encountered. Our only wish would be for a faster/stronger internet connection. BTW, this is also the children's favorite hotel in the world. They can't pronounce the name but they know it's their favorite, largely due to the special attention they receive here-- personalized cookies and ""make your own cookie"" activity, child sized robes and slippers that fit, bath toys, children's toothbrushes- they go all out here to make the kids feel at home. They are also an excellent business hotel and their spa and pool are wonderful.","Waimea, Hawaii","pkmiles</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waimea, Hawaii</strong>",104,5.0

We had room service everyday as it was just easier with the kids, and every meal was wonderful - from the tender wagyu steaks to the ocean-fresh sashimi.The key differentiater was the wonderful service provided by the staff - no request was too small (or large) and all fulfilled with quiet efficacy and always with a smile. We did not get a chance to use the complementary house cars (which included a Rolls Royce) as they were always utilised, but I am sure that would have been a great experience.If I can point to a shortcoming, it is in the sometimes cold attitude of the concierge and transportation desk staff. When we asked for suggestions or car availability, we were met with stony faces and cursory answers - I do recall the concierge being a bit friendlier the last time ...

And let me tell you, we are so happy we did because this property is true luxury.Location: The hotel is located in the Ginza neighbourhood of Tokyo. Ginza is known for being the upscale shopping area along with amazing restaurants, coffee bars, etc. I felt that it was pretty central for all of the places we were going to.Arrival: There is a circular driveway with plenty of staff to welcome you to the property. FYI – there’s also a back door to the hotel you can enter, but there’s no staff on that side.Bellman: Inside there’s always one person at the revolving door to help you with the door and asks you if you need a taxi. Then outside, there are always 2-4 people outside the hotel to help you. They serve as greeters, bellman, help you into a taxi, and everything else.Parking: Not sure about the parking situation since we didn’t have a car.Reception/Front Desk: The front desk staff is very welcoming and armed with people. There always seemed to be 5-10 people in the reception/front desk area to not only check you in, but to say hello when you arrive back to the hotel (the elevators are right next to reception), to say good bye as you’re leaving the hotel. It’s a bit overwhelming.Lobby: The lobby is large with a walkway in the center, one of their restaurants is on both sides and a two small seating areas.Room: We had room 1211 which is a deluxe room. The room was very large with a sitting area with a couch, coffee table, desk, and a table for two to enjoy your coffee or a snack.View: We had floor to ceiling windows and views of office buildings.Bed: We had a king size bed which was very comfortable. Bathroom: The bathroom was amazing. Two separate sink areas on opposite sides, separate shower, beautiful bath tub, and of course the Toto toilet that opens from a sensor. Hair dryer: The dryer was ok. It wasn’t very strong.Products: They had Oscar de la Renta products.Coffee Maker: They had an espresso machine in the room which was part of the furniture – very sleek. The pods, creamer, etc were in a drawer next to the coffee machine.Closet: There were two closet areas – one exposed, one with a door.Safe: The safe was a large hotel safe.Control Panel: It controlled the lighting, temperature, and audio. There was also a remote for the TV.Minibar: There was a standard minibar in the room.Mirrors: There was a large full size mirror along with the multiple mirrors in the bathroom.Housekeeping: Great.Wifi: The wifi was free and the speed was good.Dining: We didn’t dine at the hotel because we made reservations off property. We did have drinks at the bar of the hotel and did pick up pastries downstairs in their café. Spa/Gym/Pool: The gym was small, but had everything you needed. The pool was AMAZING. I highly recommend going for a swim if you have time. They have everything you need and its beautiful. We didn’t go to the spa.Concierge: This is one of the areas where I expected more. They were ok, but very late in responding prior to arrival when we asked for help with reservations. It would take sometimes a week before they responded back. Style: The hotel is very Peninsula traditional.Service: Overall Amazing.Other: They had these little different things in the room that I’ve never seen at another hotel such as the nail dryer for women and also the porter box by the door where they place items in it for you instead of hanging things on your door or slipping things under your door. Would I go back? DEFINITELY! It’s now on my favourite hotels list. Everything about the property is luxury, and you can’t go wrong with The Peninsula.

There's an incredible amount of highly trained, competent staff, speaking good English, catering to your every need in a polite and unobtrusive way.Rooms are (very) spacious for Tokyo, with a bed to die for and great bathroom and shower.The lobby is not up to Peninsula standards, very tiny and permanently crowded. I guess the owners of the property decided to squeeze in a few more shops in the adjoining upscale mall, and this was the consequence. The lobby restaurant / breakfast area is small, many tables squeezed in, and no food on display (another space saver).One of 4 set breakfasts are brought to you table, if your breakfat is included with your room. There also are a number of a la carte options. I was not particularly impressed with the food: Ok bircher muesli (extra 14.00 USD), bland omelette with subpar sausages (suggestion: get the same supplier as the Shanghai property does), and bottled and not very good orange juice. Seriously, the Tokyo Peninsula cannot spoil their guests with some real orange juice, when they're paying 600 USD for their room? Corner cutting and hard to accept...Great bed and pillows, great bathroom and standard Oscar de la Renta Peninsula ammenities.

Service and quality of the room does meet Peninsula standards, although it is an older hotel. The concierge, in particular, was excellent. We emailed him in advance to ask him to make a few dinner reservations for us and once we arrived, we had confirmation letters and printed maps waiting for us in our room. Lobby is always bustling but the hotel itself is located in a quiet part of Ginza, just a short walk from the subway and lots of shopping options. I would say it's a short 8-10 minute walk to the major shopping centre with Takashimaya and Matsyua department stores; also a huge Uniqlo there. Room facilities are excellent and definitely a step above some other Peninsula branches I've stayed at. There was a separate changing room / wardrobe, with a vanity table boasting a built in nail dryer (!). Huge choice of newspapers delivered to your room daily, if requested. Bathtub a good size also, with a separate shower. However, I would say that the room is showing its age, the carpet was stained in some places but overall the room was kept spotless. We also had a slight hiccup as our luggages were mixed up and sent to another room. This was fixed quickly and professionally. I also realised that I left my phone in the room after check out, and had to rush upstairs before our bus arrived - the receptionist handled this really well. I would stay here again. It's a solid and luxurious choice in Tokyo and the staff live up to Peninsula standards. Tip for those traveling from Narita Airport: the limousine bus stops right outside the hotel (and leaves right outside the airport terminal) so this is a good choice if you don't want to be burdened with carrying luggage around the subway.

The room was large; King-sized bed listening a seating area with sofa, TV, coffee table. Bed was extremely comfortable. Bathroom: two separate sinks with counter space, deep rob with spa setting (bubbles plus music!), rain shower with option for hand-held spray, WC stall. And please don't think me insane if I say that I'm going to miss that toilet. For starters, when I walked into the stall, it greeted me -- by opening. It had warmed the seat in anticipation of my arrival. When I was done, I had my choice of carefully-aimed sprays for cleansing, air drying, and two different flush settings. The dear thing practically hugged me goodbye when we left the hotel. Across the hall from the spacious bathroom is the dressing room, with space to hang everything, enough horizontal space for two large suitcases, a dressing table with makeup mirror, and a safe big enough for a laptop, if you so desire. Umbrellas, shoe horn, slippers, robe all provided. Nice soap, shampoo, conditioner were replenished as needed. Daily newspaper was delivered inside valet box. And clean! No surface there that wasn't spotless. It's true that the restaurants and bars are very expensive, but so is the rest of the hotel — and everything else in Tokyo. We enjoyed 6 breakfasts there, and my only comment would be that the bread basket selection was not consistent each day; sometimes there was toast, sometimes not; if two people were having pastries, sometimes there was only one muffin. But a request to the waitstaff fixed that instantly. The service was impeccable; I knocked over my water glass one day (usual event for me; the notable thing was that I only did it once) and before the water dripped to the floor there were three people there mopping it up, drying off my purse, replacing the linens, checking my pulse and taking my blood pressure. (Just kidding on the last two but they would have if I'd asked, I'm pretty sure.) I want these people to live in my house. In general, the service in the hotel was excellent. Oh, and make sure to go down to the basement level during business hours; you can watch the pastry chefs work their magic. The bar is fearsomely pricy but that's what's going on here. Drinks were ¥2000 (around $17.50 when we were there) and an ice cream sundae was ¥2200. Service wasn't as good as the lobby restaurant; we had to wait about 15 minutes for our drinks, they brought a drink we hadn't ordered, and we had to lay a man-trap to get someone to give us our bill. The only real disappointment was the Chinese restaurant. There weren't many options (assuming you're not eating abalone at ¥70000. — about $640), especially for pescatarians. The fish that we did have was excellent, but a rather small portion considering the cost. The vegetable options weren't very vegetative; preserved this and bamboo fungus that. Nothing green or crunchy, as far as we could tell. Oh, and you want rice? You'll have to ask for it specially, and a small bowl of room-temperature rice will set you back ¥500 -- about $4. Each. Because you're in a country where rice is rare, expensive, and hard to come by, apparently. It wasn't even very good rice; we had better at a cheap luncheon cafe where the whole meal cost us ¥1750 (about $15.50). So — skip the Chinese restaurant.

When traveling with baby, it's always appreciated if the hotel provides you a little extra help. I wrote a note to them for the fact that I will be traveling with a baby, when I checked in, everything is set in my room: baby crib, baby amenity, and even a baby bath tub upon request! The baby crib is well settled and my girl had a good night sleep with it! The staff wrote to me in advance to confirm my needs and have everything ready without hassle upon my arrival. The only thing I would brought up is the check-in speed. They have a very small check-in counter, so if you check in during the peak time like me (around 330pm), you will need to line up and wait a while (20 mins and up) to finish your check in process.

The turndown service is a nice touch with different bedside treats every night. The bathroom is classy and the music options while you're taking a bath is a very nice bonus. The check-in and check-out were efficient. And we LOVED the pool and jacuzzi. The staff lay out a towel for you as soon as you are walking into the direction of your lounger. And they immediately give you a water bottle to quench your thirst while in the pool area. Overall, all of these things were exactly what I expected of the Peninsula name. The only pitfall was the Concierge. It was very hit-or-miss. Sometimes we got a staff member that printed maps and pictures of places to go and how to get there. Other times, we got people that just mentioned where to go and I had to ask them to write the name down on a piece of paper or explain to us how to get there. It was overall very frustrating. I think that unfortunately, for a hotel of the calibre of The Peninsula, you kind-of expect perfection in all aspects of your experience.

If you want a hotel that gives you very personal service (in English in particular) and is in a great location, I have no hesitation to recommend this hotel. It is especially good if you want a relaxing trip to Tokyo (as trips to Tokyo can be hectic as there are so many places to shop) : 1. it's within 5 minutes to the shops around Ginza. If you like good Japanese food, Ginza has so much to offer2. We flew into Haneda airport. We took the monorail to the final stop and change JR to the hotel. It took 40 min. When we left, we took a taxi and it only costs 9000 yen and 30 minutes to get there.3. You can find the big dept stores around walking distance, e.g. Tokyo Hands, Loft, Muji, O1O1, BIC camera. Tsukiji fish market is only 30 min walk or 10 min taxi from hotel. Highly recommend you go there for lunch(shops closed around 2:30pm). If you can take it, buy a Hokkaido crab for 5,000 to 9800 yen to eat at the hotel. It will be at least 3 times if you eat it at home. 4. If you are not a shopaholic, you can take a 15 min taxi to Odaba where there are many entertainment and games. 5. Breakfast at the hotel is of high quality though we don't like the coffee shop on lobby level as it's too busy with many people passing through6 You can get a drink at the top floor bar called Peter. Night time atmosphere is much better than day time.7. If you like jogging, cross the road and you can jog round the palace covering 10 km 8 We were upgraded to the executive suite which has a very big living and dining area with open view. Very functional with good technology built in. 9 don't order tea and coffee from room service as you would be disappointed with the quality after paying USD15 for a cup10 We went to a teppanyaki restaurant nearby called Ukai Tei which is excellent and you should try as it is different from normal Teppanyaki (though quite expensive. We also visited a trendy sushi place called Seamon within 10 min walk.11. If you have been to Tokyo, I would recommend you going to the new Tokyo Tower called Sky Tree. There is a very big shopping centre and it was opened in about 2012.12 don't bother spending time buying souvenir (esp food and snacks) for friends during your trip.

Not at all. It is a fine place to stay - the location is fantastic and there are all the amenities a very good hotel should have. But it also prides itself of 5 star service and charges accordingly, and so should also be compared to other hotels of its league, and I am sorry to say that it falls short. On this trip, we also stayed at Shangri-La, and if Shangri-La is the standard for this type of hotel, the Peninsula lacks far behind. The Peninsula was the 5th hotel we stayed in during our 2 weeks in Japan, and perhaps we had too high expectations, but it was the hotel we liked the least. The level of service we received during our 4 other stays was simply outstanding, and we expected Peninsula to be of the same high standards, but we were really disappointed. Good Things first:As mentioned: the location. It is fabulous. Hibiya station right under the hotel with own entrance from lobby. Lovely area around hotel (treelined streets with lovely shops, cafes and restaurants) and Ginza area a short stroll away. The view from our room over Tokyo Station area on one side and a corner of the Imperial Palace was beautiful. The room was nice - a bit ""old"" in the feeling. But we like quirky and modern and Peninsula is neither, so can't really complain, it is just a matter of taste.Bathroom was big - dual sinks, shower and bathtub. We LOVED that the space was divided in a bed/living room and a dressing room with lots of space for our suitcases and shopping bags and jackets, so it did not spoil the tranquility of the bed/livingroom. Access to pool is always lovely, especially when traveling with a 14 year old. And staff at pool and spa was great and not stressed like at reception.Negatives:Got a bad feeling already at checkin. The staff seems stressed and not at all warm and helpful. They say on website and emails you get in advance that they would love to help with all your plans and needs, but we felt that we were just in the intruding and when asking something we were given standard answers that we knew ourselves.The BREAKFAST! Oh my! We had breakfast included in our rate, and were a bit disappointed to learn that breakfast is served in the lobby. With people running around with suitcases and lots of noise and very stressed and not very helpful staff. It felt like dining in a mall, and I can't understand why people come in here all day for tea and drinks when there are so many other nice places. There's no view, no pleasant surroundings, just noise and lots of people. And it is expensive! 1600 yen for a cup of coffee! 1000 yen for a bowl of cornflakes (add 300 for half a banana in slices)! 1200 yen for a glass of orange juice that clearly was not freshly squeezed. I know when staying in a hotel like this the food is going to be very expensive, but most of the time you accept it because the setting is pleasant and the food is delicious. At Peninsula it is just acceptable. Not at all something that I would pay premium price for.The rest of our stay (4 days in total) we paid extra to have it served in our room - which was far better - it allowed us a view and to have breakfast in our pyjamas, which was actually very nice after 2 weeks of dressing up for breakfast.Please be aware that there are a lot of extra taxes and charges at Peninsula. We did not experience this any other place.So - will we be back? Probably not - I think we will book the Shangri-La or maybe the new Aman for future trips to Tokyo. But we will definitely miss the location. Peninsula has a lot of potential, and if I were in charge, I would look to what other hotels in the same league are offering and step it up.

A brief summary of our stay - 1. Check in & check out - efficient, but slightly inflexible. We left our luggage with the hotel after 2 nights and travelled to Kyoto. We check back in to the Peninsula on our last day, we arrived at 12 noon but the staff on duty told us that she can't give us a room until 3pm and told us to get change at the fitness center. My husband had an injured ankle and was in need of some rest. The manager next to the check in staff immediately interfered and helped to arrange a room. 2. Concierge - the map they gave us for ramen was out of date, we took a taxi to find one we wanted to try but it was a building site. Then we tried to find another one, it took us over 30 mins to find. 3. Taxi arrangement at front of hotel - Inefficient and seemed lack of staff. We as a couple walked to the front of queue, there was a large group of businessmen walked right in front of us insisted that they were in front of us. No staff at hotel came to mend the queue. 4. Room - very well appointed, lovely walk in space for luggage, nice sitting area, nice bathroom. 5. Location - 5 minutes walk to Ginza and 5 minutes walk to underground train. 10 minutes taxi ride to Tokyo station which allows you to travel further afar to explore out of Tokyo.6. Gym - a bit small, pool was very nice but didn't have time to use.","Hong Kong, China","HKBride06</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",18,4.0

The hotel was well located, the service was excellent - very friendly and helpful at all levels - and the room was large and comfortable. We ate in the four main restaurants. These were the Cafe where we had a very good gluten-free pasta dish for lunch, and the Cafe had what looked like an excellent selection of pastries which were being enjoyed by the other guests; the Lobby where we had our Tokyo sushi meal which was very good; the Hei Fung Terrace where we had an excellent Cantonese style meal - I know it was Tokyo but the meal was really good; and the Peter Grill which was international fare which was good, but add in the view over Tokyo at night and the overall experience was very enjoyable. The hotel's location was very convenient for walking around central Tokyo - next to the Hibiya metro station, and close to the Ginza shopping area and the Imperial Palace Garden.Overall we would definitely go back to the Peninsula when in Tokyo.","Hertfordshire, United Kingdom","Chris W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hertfordshire, United Kingdom</strong>",7,4.0

On arrival at the hotel we were given the restaurant booking confirmation together with a map and information sheet detailing the dress code, budget for meal etc.The room design was great and featured lots of added extras such as valet drop box and nail dryers. Also had plenty of European plugs in the room which was very convenient. Room bed and black out blinds were amazing.

I liked The Tokyo Peninsula. It’s a very nice hotel and we enjoyed our stay…… The Peninsula has more of an intimate feel to it compared to the opulence and grandeur of the Ritz, and perhaps this would lend itself to being a hotel well suited for couples that don’t need much public space and have the luxury of being able to dine at the hotel’s more formal restaurants The rooms are well thought out and had the best layout out of the 3 properties we stayed at while visiting Tokyo. The pool area was the nicest out of the 3 properties we stayed at while visiting Tokyo.  In-Room dining was pretty much spot on from set-up to presentation to portion size to taste. Out of 2 properties where we used room service, the Peninsula was better by far.But… I don’t love The Tokyo Peninsula. While outstanding in many aspects, there are a few areas that just don’t provide the “wow” aspect that’s expected when staying at a luxury property. Little/no public areas (i.e lobby/lounges). Lack of personalized service versus standardized professional service. Lack of oomph (but still nice overall) in breakfast selection and breakfast location. The least memorable breakfast out of the hotels we stayed at. Less than optimal views from room (at least from our particular 11th floor room). The least impressive views out of the 3 properties we stayed at while visiting Tokyo.So… I didn’t really have any problems versus perhaps my own personal preferences as to a luxury hotel given consideration of my needs (family with young children travelling for leisure).Conclusion…I certainly wouldn’t object to staying again and I would certainly recommend it to others as being worth a go (with a few caveats). In-Depth Review…Family of 4. 2 Adults (40’s), 2 daughters (7 &4). 2 week vacation in Japan for Anniversary.Check in… After 15 hours of flights we took the train from Narita and grabbed a cab at Tokyo station. Standard grab the luggage and accompany client to reception desk. The entrance has a revolving door with a lady actually rotating it by hand for clients as they come and go. Interesting touch. As others have mentioned, there is no lobby to speak of and you get to reception by walking through the middle of the lobby restaurant. I’ve seen properties with small lobbies before but this place literally had no lobby at all. While I was checking in my family had to sit on benches across from the elevator. Check-in was easy enough. Standard passport scanning, running of the credit card, and signing a couple papers. Although we arrived early (0930-1000) our room was ready and waiting (which was certainly appreciated by our tired and jetlagged family).Room… Luggage was delivered within 10-15 minutes after we arrived in our room. We had an executive suite (corner room) which gave us a bit nicer view and at 83m2, a bit extra space to stretch out as well. Views from our 11th floor room were ok but nothing spectacular. Certainly the least impressive of our 3 Tokyo hotels (Ritz 53rd floor, Shangri-La 36th floor).The room was split into 2 sections that could be separated by closing a door. The living room area with a half bath (toilet and sink) and then an area with a large dressing room leading into the dressing room, bedroom, and main bathroom.Bedroom… The bedroom itself was a bit small but still quite functional. This is the only hotel we stayed at that actually had a bedroom door. They also had another door separating the living room from the main bathroom and sleeping areas. This is of course nice when some people want to watch TV/Play and others want to sleep/take a bath in peace. This was the only hotel where we had two double beds versus a king and an extra bed in the room. If we can get both kids in the same bed, having a king and an extra bed is a bit nicer for the parents. But 2 doubles worked fine with 1 parent and 1 kid in each bed.Separate heating/ac controls for the bedroom. Nice in theory but one position up or down and it would be either too cold or too hot and never an in-between comfortable. Standard bedroom amenities. Large screen TV. Safe. Ice bucket filled nightly. Water was provided when the room was made up. I found the bedroom lighting a bit hard to figure out. It seems as if you need to turn it on at full force and hold the button to dim. Not the most practical lighting system.Dressing Room… Lots of storage space here. Plenty of hanging space. Several drawers. Without a doubt the biggest and best “closet” we had while in Japan. There is a dressing table in the dressing area. This includes a makeup mirror and a hair dryer. The laundry bags are also located in this area.Valet Box….I admit that I didn’t catch onto this one until we were leaving. In the dressing room, on the wall, there is a hidden little door. Somewhere outside the room is another little door leading to the same “box”. This is where the valet will put your morning paper. If you want your shoes shined, you put them in the box and then just push a button to call the valet. I admit to never having seen this before. This was my first time at a Peninsula and in Japan, so I’m not sure where the idea came from. Is it country? Company? Or just a once off thing imagined by whoever designed this particular property? Bathroom… Bath and half actually. The Peninsula was the only hotel we stayed in to have such an amenity and when traveling as a family a half bath is a nice touch. Standard full set of bathroom amenities such as razors, toothbrushes, cotton swabs, etc. Double sinks in the main bathroom with separate tub (with tv) and rain shower. Japanese automatic toilet. There was a window above the tub, which of course is a nice touch. Ours was even with an office building and we had a good laugh wondering what the lady in the office directly across from us would think if we just started showering in the tub without closing the shades. Living room… I liked the layout here. Divided into 3 distinct sections (nd yet somehow it never seemed overcrowded). ….1. Lounging area with couch, coffee table and chair. 2. Dining area with table and seating for four. 3. Desk area. Mini bar and coffee maker are in the cabinets above the desk area. Tea setup and ice bucket next to the desk area. Living room has separate temperature controls. A nice touch in theory but we never found the temp to be comfortable (3 was too cold, 4 was too hot).Standard Large screen TV that can be easily seen from most vantage points. Half bath (toilet and sink) in hallway leading to living room.Housekeeping…. Fast efficient service. I can’t remember a single issue. Within half an hour of arriving they brought up a couple gift baskets for the kids containing snacks, games, crayons, etc. Nice touch/ especially as the adult’s only got an apple each. Lol.). Children’s robes and slippers with a Peninsula Bear motif were provided and came in different sizes. Certainly the nicest “children’s robes we had in Japan. Certainly a nice touch.A couple local juices were brought up as a gift from the property. My wife seemed to enjoy them.Both ice buckets were filled at turndown. I once hit the “make up room” button and they were there before we left the room 5 minutes later.If I remember correctly… Bottled water was left in the living room during room cleaning. Bottled water and glasses were provided bedside during turndown. Shoe Shine/Laundry… Shoes came back nicely done with complimentary travel shoe trees inserted and Peninsula shoe bags. In a moment of temporary insanity I decided to wear white trousers on an international flight. With everything from orange juice to coffee spilled on me I was sure the pants would be done for. Happily enough, laundry had them back to me in new condition a day later.I had asked laundry as to the cost of cleaning a child’s cotton dress. They sent a guy up to quote me a price significantly lower than what was listed. Even further, when we got the dress back they had charged me even less than quoted. Laundry was covered in plastic and hung in wardrobe while we out.General Service… Service, while always professional and of high standard, was never very personal. I don’t remember anyone ever greeting me with “Good morning Mr. T. did you sleep well? What are your plans today? Can I arrange something for you?” I tend to think of it more as “on-demand” service versus “pro-active service. You contact the concierge. You contact the bell desk. You contact the spa. You contact the restaurants. Etc. As an example….To me there’s a big difference between… “Mr. T? Your car is here” (Peninsula) and “Mr. T, your car is here” (Ritz)... I prefer the later.Public Spaces…There are no real public spaces to relax or stroll about. Our first night the 7 yo couldn’t sleep at 0100 so although we knew everything would be closed, we decided to go check out the location of the hotel facilities on the lower floors. This for some reason upset security who walked us down the stairs and escorted us pretty much all the way to the guestroom elevators. The next night my 3 yo pulled the same at 0300. 0300 in the morning with a jet lagged energetic 3 year old and it’s raining outside. And your $1’000 a night hotel doesn’t have a lobby or any public space to speak of. Oh well... I guess I’m one of the few tourists that can claim the experience of strolling the Tokyo backroads at 0300 with a 3 year old in the cold windy rain. Pool…… Out of the 3 properties we stayed a in Tokyo, the Peninsula had my favorite pool area. The pool area is quite large. Done in white (cream?) with 2 story ceilings, there’s really a feeling of openness and space. Yet… There’s a huge glass waterfall that gives it all quite a relaxing ambience. While certainly practical, everything just comes together nicely here to give it a pleasant atmosphere. Kickboards, water peanuts, goggles, and children’s arm floats are available for use. The obligatory swim cap will be provided should you not have your own.Bottled water is brought to you upon arrival. Pool attendant sets up your selected sitiing area.The Jacuzzi is directly next to the pool and overlooks the city. The pool is available for children to use from 0900 (1000?)-1800. I believe they have an age limit set at 4 years old (we cheated a bit with the 3 ½ yo and either they didn’t notice or they weren’t willing to make a scene). Our first night there I had forgotten the exact Children’s restricted hours and went down with my 7 yo. a bit late. I asked if there was any way we could just go for 15-20 minutes and to their credit, the spa staff called the spa manager and he/she allowed us in for 20 minutes. Nice touch and appreciated by both papa and daughter.In room dining… Woke up from our nap late in the evening. Tried to find something decent and family friendly in Ginza. No luck. Mostly casual bar/restaurants. Time to head back to the hotel for some room service. Limited night-time menu of course… but still enough selection to meet our needs. Pasta with red sauce for the 3 yo, a burger for the 7 year old, salads & Japanese curried beef for the parents. The server set everything up perfectly on the dining room table. Presentation of food was nice. The portions all of good size (I was actually a bit jealous of my daughter’s hamburger). Standard wait time of half an hour or so. Although everyone enjoyed their meal, I thought the salads were a bit limp. I’m guessing that they tossed the salads first and then let them sit while waiting 15-20 minutes for that big burger to cook.Breakfast… We took the bed and breakfast option. This was good for the 2 adults so we needed to pay 50% for the 7 year old. The 3 year old was free. There are 2 different breakfast options. A la Carte served in the lobby restaurant on the first floor… Or ….the breakfast buffet served in the basement chocolate/souvenir shop. While both were nice enough areas to eat, I can’t say either really wowed me.As a young family, buffet seems to be the easiest method of of having breakfast while on vacation. The kids can pick and choose. There is little/no wait time. Etc. So….. I can only rate the buffet.While everything was laid out nicely and well presented, I wouldn’t call the breakfast selection overly inspired versus standard fare for international luxury hotels. Selection of fresh fruits. Selection of pastries. Cold cuts. Cheeses. Salads. A few hot dishes (French toast, sausages, potatoes, bacon and scrambled eggs). Again. It was nice. It met the standards that one would expect from a buffet breakfast at a luxury property. Everything was fresh. Everything tasted good. Service was more than acceptable if not excellent. Pleasant atmosphere. I really have no complaints, it’s just not anything to really write home about. Nothing caught my eye (& taste buds) as being unique or special to the property itself, which is a bit of a shame because the other hotels all didOne morning the server asked if my daughter wanted her apple cut. This was a nice touch. When she came back with the apple they had peeled it and arranged the pieces into a swan. Very nice touch. The basement area also has the hotel’s patisserie (bakery) and chocolate making facilities in plain view (behind glass of course). Good for a few minutes of distraction for the kids. Concierge… I didn’t have much contact with the concierge. They arranged train tickets to Kyoto (without issue) and put chocolates & and an anniversary card in my room upon request. Pre-trip requests were handled in a timely and professional manner.Bell Desk… Other than grabbing the luggage a couple times, they arranged a taxi van (not the easiest to find in Tokyo) for our departure and had it there on time. Their suggestion as to departure time was closer than mine (but I still prefer to be 15 earlier than needed versus missing the train. Lol). I had written a couple times pre-trip and they always seemed quite willing to get things done.  Misc. Areas… There is a small sand garden at the bottom of the stairway. Don’t miss the “Light Tornadoes” through the little windows as you step off the elevators onto your room floor. Hard to explain but neat nonetheless. Smoking Area… Perhaps I was misinformed but it seems that the only smoking area for regular hotel guests is right outside the front entrance. I’m not a heavy smoker but I still didn’t find this to be overly convenient.Location… If you make a right hand turn when walking out the main entrance you’ll run into a quieter neighborhood with containing a few upscale shops and restaurants. If you make a left, you’ll run into a busier area. Across the road is a 24 hr 7/11 which is handy for 7/11 type items (i.e. cigarettes). If you make a left, it’s a 3-4 block walk to the main shopping area in the Ginza district. Also along the way is Sanrioland for all your Hello Kitty needs (it’s pretty much just a store but they do carry made in Japan items that are only available in Japan).Conclusion…. I guess that’s about it. As you can see (if you actually made it this far), there are many, many spot on things when it comes to the Tokyo Peninsula. I had an overall positive experience. I really liked the whole package of the product…but… I wish there was more to it…I wish they had more of a view. I wish that there was something more to their breakfast, something special. I wish they had more space such as a real lobby or a club level lounge (which are nice when you want to get out of your room yet stay in the hotel). I wish they had the more personal service of the dedicated concierge concept. To me, it’s much nicer having someone report to you every morning versus having to chase 5 different staff members from 5 different departments and then having to check back with them, and then not being able to talk to the same person but a colleague… By time you’re done you’ve talked to 15 different people and are praying that everyone is on the same page as to times, changes, etc. So yeah. I prefer dealing with one person and letting them coordinate things. I prefer to sip coffee in the lounge while discussing transportation versus standing in line at the concierge desk. A bit over 4 circles but not a 5 in my opinion. Although I might prefer the Tokyo Ritz, I would happily stay at The Peninsula again and I would recommend it to others looking for a more subdued classic atmosphere.","Lausanne, Switzerland","theswissmister</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lausanne, Switzerland</strong>",284,4.0

Our room was very roomy with a small living room and table, walk-in closet and bathroom with tub, shower, japanese style toilet (weird if you are not familiar with heated, automatic, water sprinkling toilets), and double faucets which if you are travelling with your wife is very much appreciated as it significanlty contributes to peace and tranquility). We also had a view of the park on the 20th floor which is my suggestion, get a top floor with a view of the park. Definitley worth it. Staff was very very polite and despite us arriving after 14hrs from Mexico at the hotel at 9am, they were accomodating to out needs, offered to give us another room in lieu of ours which was not ready yet and were overall very pleasing and had a pleasant customer oriented attitude. What we did in the end was not take the sub-room, and went to the Spa were we had a 2 hr massage booked in advance. The Spa facilities are clean, functional, and contributing towards a good experience. The massage itself was great as well and I especially liked the availability of a safe inside your massage therapy room (not in the locker/dressing room) where you could take off and leave watches, rings, etc with full certainty for their well being. I know, you are in Tokyo and in a nice hotel, but still, it never hurts to be safe. The lobby is where you can have breakfast, aside from a buffet at the Chinese restaurant and in-room dining. Breakfast is not awesome, but it was ok, try the lychee slurpee, that was nice. Coffee is really good and you can request a to-go cup and avoid a starbucks stop as other westerners foolishly do. Do try: 1. Boutique & Cafe: Good coffee, great desserts, try the chocolate and cream ones as weel as the macarons (especially the raspberry one). 2. A ride in Peninsula's fleet: Whether you book a whole day, half a day or 1 hour as we did, a city is always better seen while on a Rolls Royce (r at least not worst). If you do not want to roll around om a Rolls all day, there is also an entrance to subway's Hibiya station right underneath the hotel which is very useful if it is raining. There are 3 lines that pass through that station and there is also the Ginza station at walking distance connecting you to more lines.You can avoid: Restaurant at the hotel: Tokyo Tsuruya. It is Kaiseki style, and although good it is not awesome both food and service wise.","Mexico City, Mexico","Santiagoacuna</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mexico City, Mexico</strong>",35,5.0

We had a very good prix fixe dinner that, for Tokyo, was very inexpensive and also very good. There are 2 things that, from my point of view, make this something less than 5-star: 1) Breakfast - the lobby breakfast is not great but there was a decent buffet in the basement for the days we were there - decent but not great 2) the lobby - this is not a pleasant place to be, particularly on the weekend when lots of people come in for afternoon tea or just to rubberneck.

The room is super spacious with cloakroom and huge bathroom (bathtub + shower with double basin). One day morning, we over slept till nearly 11am and were going to miss the breakfast. We called for the room service and they delivered the foods to us within 30mins. We were having our breakfast in the room and the way they served us was just like having meals in a fine dining restaurant. We enjoyed the breakfast with the view of palace.

The staff is wonderful and very helpful. I agree with other reviews that the lobby is disappointing with no room to sit and relax, you walk right through a restaurant to get to the elevator and the front desk. I can't imagine it's nice for people eating at the restaurant either. The little things make this hotel exceptional. The floors in the bathroom are heated. The large closet and dressing room are second to none. The couch and small table for meals (already set for use) are nice. We didn't use the pool but we did take a look. You have to go through the spa to get to it and I'm not sure it's really designed for kids, which may be good for some people. The location is good. You can walk from Tokyo Station or take a taxi for around 1000 Yen. It is a short walk to Ginza and the subway and JR line are very convenient. We had room service one night. It was 'okay' nothing spectacular, but there are plenty of restaurants and bars very close to the hotel.

We stayed there twice, most recently last week. Hotel concierge booked us a sushi restaurant. That was our one night out in town without the kids so we were quite looking forward to it. The sushi restaurant was located in Ginza and had a 48-hour cancellation policy. Our taxi driver couldn't find it and so was everyone we asked around the block. After walking in the rain for more than 30 minutes trying to find it we gave up and settled in another restaurant because the babysitter would be leaving in 1 1/2 hour and we were very cold and starving. While we were in the restaurant trying to enjoy what was left of our evening, concierge called to tell us since we didn't make it to the restaurant, we need to pay for it anyway. While I tried to explain what happened, she firmly pointed out the map they gave us had never failed before and I must had a very bad taxi driver. At the end, she ""kindly"" reminded me that I must go to the concierge desk on the next day to settle the bill for the original restaurant. After that we tried very hard to enjoy the rest of meal. When I went to see the concierge service to settle the bill, I said right away that I would pay for the restaurant bill as agreed but I did not appreciate the way how the concierge staff handled the entire situation. The concierge manager came after I talked to one of the staffs. The first thing she said to me was, ""Did you not have a phone with you? It didn't occur to you to call us for direction?""

The location is exceptional, the subway line is in the basement of the hotel, across the street from the Imperial Palace, and near a lot of good restaurants. Our room was exquisite although we had no view at all. The level of details in that room was exceptional. The beds were very comfortable and an espresso machine in our room made for an excellent night and morning. I am going to miss the deep tub and the water pressure in the shower. I am not sure how they clean the rooms or do the turn down as you never see a cart in the corridor but it is done exceptionally well and twice a day. We were quite jet lagged so we ordered room service at 2 am and the attendant spoke excellent English and the food was delicious. Our breakfast was included and delicious. Lots of choices. As many other reviewers complained about the location of the lobby restaurant, I did not dislike it at all. The only thing we did not like is that smoking is allowed at the Peter bar and we were surrounded by smoke when we went for a drink and chose to drink fast and leave. We are just no longer used to people smoking around us. And finally the service was excellent, from the front desk to the transportation desk, to the restaurant servers; everyone was so helpful. It is expensive but it's still value for money. I've stayed at equally expensive hotels in Istanbul, Hawaii and Munich for instance but I was never as wowed as I was at the Peninsula Tokyo.

Rare is the hotel that can consistently maintain a high standard and generally, they do tend to regress after several years, sometimes significantly so. Such unfortunately is the case with the Peninsula Tokyo. When it first opened nearly 9 years ago, the hotel was ground-breaking in every way with truly great wow factor in every aspects, with incomparable rooms, the finest decoration and fittings and excellent F&B and immaculate and attentive service. During it's first few years where I visited Tokyo quite often, I repeatedly patronized the hotel. Peninsula was and remained one of my favorite hotels in Tokyo until now. So what has changed in my latest stay? The hotel appears to be still popular but with a different crowd. Breakfast was set-menu only, the same every day and appallingly limited in the number of choices, in a crowded environment with tables so close to each other that I got very uncomfortable when the guest next to me start to cough and sneeze away. Whereas in the past, you get a great table if you wake up early, now, the lobby lounge, which is the only venue for breakfast is always crowded. The choices are standard fair asian or western continental or american breakfast. While they still do the omelet right, the pastries were dull, the coffee mediocre and everything else is not what it seems compared to the high standards of the past. I still recalled fondly in the past when ordering the Peninsula breakfast set, it comes with a tray that resembled the afternoon tea with bite-size pastries and sandwiches all very neatly done. Now, the servicing is just plain and uninspired. And so is the biggest problem with the hotel, the F&B. I did have a free F&B voucher courtesy of my travel agent and tried to utilized it by having dinner at the lobby restaurant. I should not have been bothered. The caesar salad was served over-flowing with dressing and taste awful while the main course, a fish dish… the less said about it the better. How can a 5-tar luxury hotel serves food of such appalling quality? It has clearly been rushed or mass produced in the kitchen with little or no care to the taste. So was the breakfast I ordered in-room and the waffles tasted so bad they were inedible. I am sure any restaurant within walking distance from the hotel will serve 10X better quality food with less than 1/2 the price. Another big problem with the hotel now is the service which has really gone downhill. Staff behavior especially at the lobby lounge during breakfast was very snotty and they seemed intended just to show how busy they are and rush to take your order than to service the customer. No smiles, no greetings and not even a ""Good Morning"". This is really ironic consider that Japanese by nature tends to be very polite and have extremely good service. Service was a bit better during other meals but still nothing special. Everything about this hotel is by the book as if they are following an instruction manual. I am guessing the hotel has lost a lot of good staff to competitors. Which brings me to the next issue, nickel and dime. I have never, I mean never ever in my 10+ years of travel ever encountered a luxury hotel that wanted to charge me for a nail cutter ( JPY1,000 ). Or ask for ""delivery charges"" ( JPY500 ) for in-room dinning. A strong complaint to the Manager on duty resolved the first issue but I did not bother with the second. Such behavior just annoys the guests and makes the hotel seems very small-minded and stingy. Any plus? Tthe hotel rooms are relatively well maintained and the location is still unbeatable, walking distance from Ginza and with a subway station right under the basement of the hotel. However, the glamour has faded significantly and in my opinion as a discerning traveler, I don't think this property can still be considered top end in Tokyo anymore, especially with properties like the Aman Tokyo and Andaz just opened.",JAKARTA,"BENLEE123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>JAKARTA</strong>",775,3.0

The view through the floor to ceiling windows of the imperial palace gardens to one side and the city to the other was breath taking, as was the rest of the room. The room had a walk in wardrobe which was the size of a small room and a very large bathroom room which at the touch of a bottom turned into a private spa room complete with mood lighting and tranquil music. The only issue with the rooms were that it was a smoking room, when booking it didn't even occur to ask for a non smoking room as since the smoking ban in the UK I don't even consider asking anymore, but being a non smoker I could smell the stale smell of smoke in the room when I entered or lay on the sofa. However when I enquired with the guest relations about the smell they where more than helpful and offered to switch room, as I had unpacked and the smell seemed to disappear fast I just stayed put, so instead they sent a bottle of wine to the room when they did the turn down service, which was lovely to sip whole overlooking the city at night.The rest of the hotel was just as good as the rooms, the pool area is a great place to unwind after walking around the city, the staff bring proved you with water, towels and swimming hats ( which are mandatory in the swimming pool) but once you get over the fact you look ridiculous it ok.Peters bar in he roof has great views of the city and as you would expect from a roof bar very stylish, happy hour was between 5-7 with most drinks half price which is alway good.The hotel had a private entrance to the underground from the lobby, once you get your head around the net work is far better than a taxi, not only miles cheaper but much faster, we used an app which directs you through the system using the colours and number.All in all a great stay, amazing staff and service, if you visiting Tokyo I would highly recommend staying here.

Everything makes perfect sense and well-thought out, with two sinks on opposite sides of the room.Hotel concierge is extremely helpful with restaurant bookings.There are two exits of the Hibiya Station right next to the hotel, so it's very convenient. It's also a very short walk from Ginza, and right in front of the Imperial Palace.","Hong Kong, China","Peech</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",123,5.0

Staff were just as professional and the rooms just as beautiful. Housekeeping once again excel at providing impeccable and immaculate rooms that are so comfortable to stay in. Seriously, the housekeeping staff here are incredible. Our numerous requests made prior to arriving were all met including our request to have the cot for our baby placed in the walk in robe (which the same size as some Japanese hotel rooms and still had plenty or room for our luggage and a study!)I do love the in room coffee machine as good coffee in japan is hard to find. I still loved the pool and spa and the service in this area is just wonderful. In the basement there is an ATM and bakery and there is also clear windows so we can enjoy watching the pastry chefs at work. My husband and baby were sleeping one afternoon so I took my toddler down to the bakery for a treat - all the pastries and hot chocolates here were so delicious. However due to a private party, there was nowhere to sit. I felt that the cafe could have provided small tables and chairs within the cafe section or perhaps in the wide walkway outside. There could have been other options provided and I think that this should have been arranged for the inhouse guests. The lobby restaurant however were very gracious in allowing us to enjoy our goods there though. I'm sure this is not policy however I appreciate the leniency. By the afternoon we all really enjoyed walking around the Ginza and seeing the lights etc of this vibrant community. The Peninsula is expensive but it's worth it. We had just come from the JW Marriott,Seoul which has spoiled us and given us new definition of luxury - previously this hotel was the standard for me. This hotel is still exquisite though and the standards and furnishings have not slipped in the two years since our last visit. We will return again to The Peninsula.","Adelaide, Australia","julesandheath</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",168,5.0

It is very nice to have a proper seating area in your room, all facilities were excellent, although I perhaps would expect toiletries to be of a more luxury brand - but I am clutching at straws here. The closet was really a walk-in dressing room, which was perfect, even for such a short trip as mine. As for the bathroom, cavernous and i couldn't fault it in any way. I also made use of the dry cleaning service, which was hyper efficient, as the rest of the hotel.If I haven't given this hotel a full rating is for the simple reason of their restaurant for breakfast/lunch/afternoon tea. It is literally part of the lobby, and when having breakfast I felt like I was part of the group just waiting for someone else to join them in the lobby itself, I could have join into their conversation with no effort at all! The problem, as pointed by other travellers, is that you would be at the restaurant, literally sitting at the other side of the sofas in the lobby itself - I feel this could do with re-designing for such a hotel.Room service was polite, professional and with no faults at all.All in all, I would strongly recumbent this hotel.

The furniture is beaten and shabby, the bulbs in the ceiling are of mismatched wattage and type... but the coupe de gras is the entire cabinet below the writing desk devoted to the FAX MACHINE. the exit from the elevators is positioned in such a way that one is forced to promenade just in front of the 5 or 6 reception attendants every time you enter or exit, which causes too much forced pleasantries, it really gets old.

The beautiful Hibiya Park is also nearby and for avid runners, there’s a wonderful 5km route within the park itself.

Checking in was very good. The front desk staffs were efficient, polite and professional. The concierge service was top notch as they were very detailed and helpful in our queries and reservation of restaurants.

It is pretty high tech too – lightings can be adjusted (with dimming and mood control), curtains are remotely controlled, humidity level in the room is adjustable, motion detectors for the night lighting and there’s even a panel providing information on the outside temperature, wind-chill and humidity levels. The room has a spacious work area which comes equipped with quite a few charging stations and a fax/printer/scanner machine. There’s even Internet Radio and a Lavazza coffee machine. The bathroom has a separate cubicle for the WC (which is fully automated) and another cubicle for the shower together with the most inviting-looking bathtub as the centrepiece here. The bed comfort, from the mattress to the pillows and bed/pillow sheets, was very good and possibly one of the best I’ve experienced. The housekeeping service, which includes the turn-down service, was excellent - very meticulous and detailed. Laptop cables, shoes/slippers, personal toiletries etc were all rearranged. We certainly had an exceptional and outstanding stay at the Tokyo Peninsula.

From the moment hotel reservations were made, right to the time we checked out, I can only describe our stay as being near perfect.After our booking with the hotel was secured, I emailed the concierge team to secure restaurant reservations. Tokyo boasts a wealth of highly sought after and exclusive restaurants, sometimes seating no more than 6 or so persons at a time. I gave the concierge a list of restaurants and dates, and received prompt response that most of the restaurants I had requested only open their reservation availability a month before, but assured me that they will follow up and update me in due course. Having had bad experience with another hotel of similar callibre, I was not hopeful that they would succeed and made a note to make the reservations myself. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that to the date that the concierge team said they would get back to me, I received all my request reservation confirmations.Arriving at the Peninsula late in the evening via taxi from Haneda, we were warmly welcomed and our luggage was taken care of. Check in was swift and efficient. We were given a deluxe room with a city view, this room was very large by any standard, almost like a suite, with separate bath/toilet, and walk in dressing room (complete with nail dryer)! Through a sliding door, we access the room, king-sized bed, cosy seating area in front of the TV and a small dining table. A very tech-smart room, it has sensors for everything, lights, dimmers, mood lighting, night light were mostly motion detected. Humidity levels could be set in the room, and all controls were centralised in a panel by the bed. Another panel by the desk told us the outside temperature and humidity. Excellent level of housekeeping, very comfortable bed and duvet affording a great nights' sleep. Complimentary water, coffee/tea amenities and fruits were also provided. Despite full occupancy of the hotel, we were not disturbed in anyway.Bathroom was large and spacious, in marble and sparkling clean. Generous and well thought out toiletries. Location-wise, situated opposite the Imperial Palace, it is at the end of a busy stretch of road in Ginza, so walking out of the hotel and not being immediately met with the hustle and bustle of a large city is a joy. Free drop-off in their Rolls Royce to any destination within 1 km of the hotel is a great add on service. The Tokyo subway station Hibiya is literally at the doorstep. 3 subway lines stop at Hibiya station which makes travelling anywhere in Tokyo very easy.Would I return to this hotel?

We could not have been happier with the room. It was more like a junior suite, with an entry foyer and dressing area with plenty of room for luggage, a comfy sofa, table for in-room dining and a little workstation. Plenty of charging stations. An enormous, lovely bathroom with a gorgeous tub, roomy rain shower. Lots of separation. TV in the bathroom, big flat screen elegantly hidden away in the main room. Without doubt, this was the smartest smart hotel room I've ever seen. The controls were intuitive and easy to use. The lighting was splendid and easily modified to suit ones needs. Tap the bedside table in the middle of the night, and a gentle, subtle night light illuminates to help you see your way. Our room looked out on the building next door, but we didn't mind. We could see lines of people moving through two levels of train stations, which was actually interesting. The staff were professional and friendly. Housekeeping were flawless and took every effort to tidy our room twice daily. The concierge helped us make dinner reservations, prepared English and Japanese language maps for taxi drivers, and ably assisted us regarding Shinkansen and other travel issues. Doormen were constantly handing us umbrellas as we stepped outside. The location over Hibiya Station is ideal. The hotel has a nice, subtle, private entrance in the station. Hibiya is an excellent station for a home base as it connects to three good lines, but it's not as big and unmanageable as other central stations. I would not want to fight my way through Tokyo Station or Shibuya Station every day, every time I went out. Hibiya was just right. Also, joggers will love the location next door to the Imperial Palace, with one of the best jogging courses in Tokyo. Staff can give you a map. Doormen are standing by with towels on one's return. Also, it's a block away from all of the yakitori joints tucked under the railway tracks, which is great fun if you're in the mood for some grilled meat and cold beer in colorful surroundings. I agree with other reviewers who complained about the lobby sharing space with the restaurant. I wish the lobby had had a lounge area where one could sit with a drink. There is no good place to wait for someone or to meet informally. There are two small sofas in the middle of the single lobby hallway, just a place to sit for a minute while your bags are moved. We encountered a wedding in the lobby, but the happy couple marched down the aisle with some alacrity, holding us up for only a few minutes. We ate breakfast every morning in the lobby restaurant. The food and service were faultless, but I found myself wishing that the hotel had a separate restaurant area and even (gasp!) a buffet. The hotel itself is beautiful, though it was a bit formal and stuffy for my tastes. On the plus side, there aren't many too many young hipsters hanging out here. Would I return?

I was a bit surprised to be greeted by name by the doorman and front desk person despite my unusually long absence. On the other hand, it is that level of attention to detail and customer focus that have kept me coming back.In addition to the great service, the rooms are simply outstanding. Large and comfortable with a good integration of technology. A recent reviewer mentioned he thought the rooms needed ""refreshing"", I respectfully disagree but realize to each his own. I have noted no decline in the rooms which are head and shoulders above most of the competition of high end hotels in Tokyo. The location near Ginza and Hibiya Park is very convenient for eating, shopping and moving around the city. A morning jog around the Imperial Palace is a great way to start a day. The gym in the hotel is well equipped. I agree with the other reviewers that the lobby is a bit bizarre - not really a lobby at all more like a path through the restaurant to the check-in area with inadequate space for meeting people. That drawback is minor in my opinion. The Peninsula is a relatively small property which is a strength in that allows for better customer service. I used to stay at the Imperial nearby and always felt like I was at a bus station when checking in.When I first began staying at the Peninsula, I was traveling on a corporate expense report; I have my own company now so expenses come out of my personal bottom line but that does not deter me from staying at this property. It should be noted that this is a very high end hotel with a demanding clientele. When the standards are high it is much easier to have complaints - reviews should be read with this in mind. I have averaged 150 days of business travel a year for almost two decades, staying at this hotel feels like coming home - there aren't many places I have stayed around the world I can say that about.","Charlotte, North Carolina","lithiumsan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charlotte, North Carolina</strong>",59,5.0

Great service is expected and delivers here but like the decor is not quite what it was when I was last here. Housekeeping did their job well but when I recall the delight I had returning to my room on my first visit to find my phone recharger delicately coiled almost as meticulously put together as a piece of origami, I was kind of disappointed to find my charger still a mess of wires when I returned to my room each day. That said, staff are very friendly and chatty which was great. Breakfast at the hotel is OK but not amazing - there are better places nearby.

Minor issue of a smoking room being provided was promptly sorted by one of the most polished concierges I have met, she was quite faultless throughout our stay when we encountered her. The rooms are dated by their technology but they do still provided everything and more than you need. We had a full dressing room which was amazing, bathroom was amply large with every amenity you could think of at your fingertips. Sound proofing of the room was exceptional I never heard any road noise despite being in the centre of Tokyo.

English was spoken well by all that I encountered.- Fantastic location, so close to the metro and walking distance to the Imperial palace.Cons:- Just two really, the overlapping dining and lobby area, such an odd concept, while we were there they used the lobby for a wedding party arrival which made it feel that other guests were invading the wedding.

FAIRLY LARGE as one could imagine. WE COULD NOT pass for 10 Minutes. We were not the only ones.We stood there 5 People with cases completely Blocked.SORRY Management but if you have an EVENT as an INDIVIDUAL or GROUP you SHOULD NOT Inconvenience others. Our Aunt is Mid 80s and we all had cases and had to stand therereally tired waiting for people enjoying THEIR day BUT INCONVENIENCING OTHERS.b) We went down to CHECK OUT and the Line was about 30 Long. There is Virtually No Lobby as the Reception is VERY SMALL and is Connected to the Restaurant. To associate the Peninsula Hotel with these kind of amenities is unimanigable until you experience it.

I realise it might be a cultural thing but having smokers in the bar next to the restaurant is something from the dark ages. Even if it is cultural, being a global world-class hotel means understanding guests want to enjoy their drink and food without the noxious vapours of smokers thrown in - I'm surprised the chef even allows it to take place.Anyway if I hadn't have eaten there this hotel would be as close to perfect as you can get in a city hotel.So in short when I come back I will be staying here (just not eating in Peter and Peter)!","Sydney, Australia","Circumnavigator222</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",90,5.0

When they were delivered, they looked average, but when I tried to eat them, I found them to be bone, fat andbarely edible. I called for the tray to be picked up and told the young woman who came to collect the tray, I was very dissatisfied and I would probably cancel the rest of my stay because of the bad meal. A gentleman from the kitchen staff called me and offered a free cup of coffee.By then I was really upset and called the front desk to cancel.The next morning I was met by the Front Desk Manager, who apologized for the treatment I had received. I showed him the picture of the dinner I sent back to prove the source of my displeasure. The damage was done.. In apology he had me transported to another hotel in the Rolls Royce Now I will admit most everything else at that hotel was excellent. I prefer a Breakfast buffet, and a proper lobby.

The room is arguably better than Shangri La, with more detailed human interface design and is more organically pleasing. The gym is quite excellent as well, although not quite as elegantly beautiful as Shangri La. The bell staff & concierge are amazingly attentive. But it has the WORST lobby & breakfast experience, EVER. I guess it's trying to replicate the Hong Kong Peninsula, but with a much smaller area and direct path from entrance to front-desk, the lobby area looks like a night-market: loud & crowded. It's difficult for a busy business travel person to be too creative & cute for breakfast option. So to me, the hotel has to get the breakfast just about perfect. It is not, unfortunately. Ordered eggs over medium, and twice came back well done. The staff did not check back the second time to see if it's OK. I gave up, signed the bill and asked for coffee. Didn't come. Anyway, when the escalation finally ended, the duty manager came to my room to apologize & asked for second chance. You'd think the 2nd chance would be rather over-the-top breakfast. It wasn't. The lobby manager didn't even as much say hello, as if I were a stranger.The breakfast, in a way, is a interesting illustration of hotel stuck in '90s Japan: attentive service if you don't ask for anything; poor command of English; packaged granola & generic coffee. OK at a three star hotel, but not good enough amongst the elites.

The rooms are gorgeous, incredibly quiet, super comfortable jewel boxes with every mod-con you could need - all easy to work out and operate. The beds are super comfortable. Great views from most rooms. The service here is about as good as you can get, from front desk to bell captains, housekeeping and concierge. The atmosphere is one of refined elegance. The Spa was one of the best I have encountered in all of Asia. The Chinese restaurant was outstanding for dinner, albeit very expensive, as is all of the food within the hotel. The breakfast is a bit of a let down and ridiculously expensive. The quality of the food is good but there is just not enough choice. Service at breakfast, again, was superb. The odd thing is the absence of a lobby area, as it is all given over to dining, where many meetings were taking place over a meal. I would say that The Peninsula is better suited to the business traveller, however there were plenty of people staying here for holidays. Needless to say this is a very popular hotel with Americans. I did fa great deal of the people staying here rather ""snooty"", I'd swear some of their faces would crack if they even contemplated a smile. Both The Peninsula and the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo suffer from this rather odd, snobby clientele. It didn't matter really, I just don't understand the lack of acknowledgement of unfriendly people.

The location is great as you can quickly get to most places in Tokyo that you’d want to visit, whether by taxi or public transit, the latter of which is actually connected to the hotel itself at the basement level. We had a deluxe bedroom on the 16th floor, which was remarkably quiet. The windows were double paned glass with a far greater distance (10cm or 4 inches) between the two panes of glass than usual so perhaps this helped make the room very quiet. In addition we never heard our neighbours, which was a nice bonus when you’re trying to sleep or rest. We also used the fitness centre, which was pretty good and my wife used the pool and was very happy with the facilities.  The bed and the pillows were wonderfully comfortable and really helped us get a good night’s sleep. The service of the staff was generally excellent although they could use some additional training in the restaurant service area as we’d often sit there for a bit longer than was necessary in order to have something attended to like getting a refill on a drink or clearing our plates etc. The lobby had a nice feel to it with a high ceiling of about 10 meters (30 feet), however there was little room in the lobby for someone to meet you as most of the area was used for seating of the lobby area restaurant, however this was not a major issue in the scheme of things. Breakfast was served from 6AM to 11AM, which is a nice range of time for the early birds as well as the night owls among us. The food itself was quite good too and was included in our package. However, the hotel tried to charge us close to $100 for our first day’s breakfast despite the fact that we were missing the last day’s breakfast. I simply refused to pay for this as firstly breakfast was included in our rate and secondly as no one had ever advised us of the hotel’s policy on not having breakfast on your day of arrival. The wifi in the room was decent but should be faster so I think they need to address that issue. Also, one thing that bothered me was the fact that the temperature of the room automatically get’s warmer overnight, likely a cost saving measure, which caused me to have a dry throat and to become uncomfortable to fall asleep in one temperature and to wake up in another one. This too should be fixed though I suspect that the hotel does this on purpose in order to save A/C costs. All in all though a great location and a very good hotel which is clean, comfortable and a pleasure to stay at. If they make the minor improvements suggested herein it will be even that much better. I hope that this review was of help and if so would ask that you kindly indicate so by clicking the appropriate link re helpful reviews.

It's beside the Imperial Palace which is a large green area in the city and an area of upmarket shops and very European style cafes. It's very near Tokyo Station and underground and overland train stations so don't worry about getting anywhere relatively easily.The bedrooms are a good size by Japanese standards and have everything that you would expect and want. There is free WiFi everywhere, which can't be said for The Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo, but more of that in my review of that hotel (which is excellent apart from the WiFi).The front of house staff are excellent, as are the many ladies on the Concierge desk. As you would expect, nothing is too much trouble and there are a number of restaurants in the hotel. Traditional Japanese, Chinese and 'Peter' the grill restaurant. Peter is one of the best designed restaurants I've been in. Interesting clusters of tables and a huge video screen currently promoting the opening of The Peninsula Paris. The food was also excellent. The downside? Well you can still smoke in some places in Japan and the Peninsula, like many other hotels, allows it in the bar at Peter. So smoke drifts across to where you are eating. The bar is also a nice place to sit and watch the views but the smoke is even stronger there.If they eliminated the smoke it would have been one of the most enjoyable meals I've had in a while.So in summary I would say that you will not be disappointed by the service, bar, choice of restaurants (and basement cafe for delicious cakes and chocolates) but the area is a bit quieter than others, the views from the hotel a bit more limited (in my experience).Still very good though. 5 stars.","Belgrade, Serbia","iainm638</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Belgrade, Serbia</strong>",68,5.0

Do visit the gym and pool when you can. Peters, a bar offers nice view of the city and nice beers. Try the Nikka whiskey if you can. The lobby which cuts across the coffee house is a little weird as it doesn't offer place to hang around. The concierge service is top class and do ask them for their map of Ramen shops. The set breakfast at 4200 yen is quite pricey as you can get the same fare at one fourth of the price. Overall I love the rooms and the free wifi at the Peninsula.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","Tammy7767</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong>",72,5.0

The corridors were very warm and the room was quite noisy. The breakfast was quite bad. First the hostess tries to seat everyone close to each other and we could not talk due to a business meeting next to us that was loud. The service was bad -- we asked for milk for our tea and they kept bringing cream. Asked for water that we never got. The breakfast was generic and greasy. The final straw was the foreign exchange rate. We were given a $100 credit that the hotel translated to 9,600 yen -- the exchange rate was 107 yen to a dollar that day. It was a clear case of fleecing. Stay away -- Conrad Hilton and Hotel Imperial are better choices.","Miami, Florida","ArunS515</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",83,1.0

Right on top of Hibiya subway station. Perfect to explore Tokyo+ amazing rooms, fantastic electronic features, such as see wind direction, strength and temperature outside. + big walk in closet+ every room is like a suite+ fast elevators and not much walking to the room due to building design+ I did enjoy the gym and pool a lot+ concierge was pretty good with bookings and sightseeing suggestions. Now the negatives :- booked two rooms for four nights and somehow hotel put the rooms on different floors, which is a weird thing to do for a family travelling together. It took half an hour at check in to convince them that this was not appropriate. In the end they suddenly found two rooms on the same floor- dreadful lobby design. Lucky I booked without breakfast as I would have hated to spend one minute more than necessary in that dark, ugly, red carpeted hole. nevertheless it was always full of local guests- I saw a piece of fruit, at least 1.5 inch big lying around on our floor outside the lift for several days. Surprised no hotel staff saw it. Or did they just not care?- older travellers beware. The oldest person in our group had serious difficulties operating all the funky electronic gadgets. But I myself loved it- coffee machine in the room broke down. They fixed it, next day same problem..Overall a great stay, thanks to the city and the hotel location but honestly for the amount of money, and compared to other similar hotels worldwide, I would have expected better service. - ","Hong Kong, China","TravelCQ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",170,4.0

In 8 visits over 5+ years it has never been anything less than spectacular! I confess to hesitating to write this review because I fear too many people will want to stay and we won't get in at some point! The rooms are gigantic by any standard and particularly for hotels in Japan, with a separate bedroom area (with a sliding door made from an enormous wood slice of some beautiful tree) AND separate walk-in closet/dressing room and separate large bath. All the amenities you can ask for are present. Everything is super high quality (sheets, marble, etc). The views are great (we have had rooms on every side and height). The staff is unbelievable--friendly, welcoming, helpful, and super professional. Japanese hotel standards are quite high and at every price point, better than you would find elsewhere. This holds true even at the Peninsula's high rates. It is definitely ""value for money."" I can't adequately describe the feeling of well-being that is imparted by a stay at the Peninsula. Not just while one is there, but long after leaving when remembering the ""Peninsula Experience."" We are fortunate to be able to travel and stay at top hotels. The Peninsula Tokyo is by far our favorite hotel in the world.On a practical note, not only is the hotel awesome, but it is in a great location. Right above Hibiya Station (there is even an inside entrance from the hotel) with the helpful Hibiya, Chiyoda and Ginza lines, less than 2 blocks to the Yurakacho stations (JR and metro), all of Tokyo is readily accessible. Also nearby is Hibiya Park, with what seems like a festival of some kind happening every weekend. Lots of fun restaurants are also an easy walk away, as is the Ginza for shopping.Bottom line: The Peninsula Tokyo is simply the best!","Naples, Florida","JOIFL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Naples, Florida</strong>",56,5.0

This hotel knows what the word Service means. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels across the world, but the Peninsula Tokyo really beats them all in terms of service. We booked on their website where they have an offer with an automatic room upgrade (I think till the end of August) and we ended up in a lovely room with a beautiful view of the Imperial Palace park. The room was meticulously clean, the bed really comfortable and there are different types of sockets for electricity, so we did not even need to use a converter. There are coffee and tea making facilities, which I thought was nice, although I must admit that the hot water for tea from the machine did spatter a bit, so you have to be a bit careful not to burn yourself. The fruit provided each day is of an amazing quality. Yes, it may only be 3 mandarins, but the taste of them: divine! Note that fruits in Tokyo are really expensive, but the taste...The bathroom is great: the rain shower is very nice, the electronic toilet awesome and the bathtub fills up really, really quickly. When in the bathtub there is a button for relaxing music, which normally works on my nerves, but this was really nice and indeed relaxing. The only thing missing in the amenities was bath salt, which was a bit strange...The concierge service is impressive. They recommended a number of really nice restaurants, made reservations, helped with making a ferry reservation for later on during our trip, checked whether we could attend a sumo match or visit a sumo stable (unfortunately it wasn't the season) and helped us with many more things. Nothing was too much. If they could not get the answer immediately, we would find a letter in our room when we returned to the room with the answer.The location in Ginza is furthermore really good (note also that the hotel has direct access to the metro station) as it is a short walk to many sights as well as many great restaurants and shops.We liked the hotel so much, that we decided to return at the end of our trip for one last night in Tokyo.

I find it very inappropriate to put pressure on the guest in such a situation.If the Hotel screws something up and can't provide the booked room then the Hotel should rectify that with a free upgrade, not the other way around.Coincidentally I made the same experience in other 5-Star Hotels in the same area (they try to upsale upgrades when checking in) so I'm starting to believe that this is normal etiquette in those establishments.

At Peninsula, you will not get that feeling.If you are a Peninsula fan and do not care much about the expansive city views that high towers provide, then you will like the place for its location, pool, food and service.Note that fitness room has no windows, and very limited machines. Starbuck fan? There's a few in the area and one just on the side crossing the street.Need an ATM to get some cash? Not easy in Japan unless you find an ATM at the 7/11 and there is one at the Peninsula just underneath in the subway station.Breakfast in the lobby may be you're best meal of the day!

Our family of four with 11 y.o and 4 y.o stayed in a Deluxe Room for 4 nights. We took advantage of their new website special offer for free room upgrade. The room was spacious. It had a separate sitting area, small dining table, spacious bathroom with separate shower, bathtub, and toilet. On the other side of the room was a very spacious walk-in closet with plenty of space/drawers to store your stuff along with the vanity table. The bed was comfortable, the shower was nice although the hair dryer could be better. Toto toilet was always fancy.Check in and out was done quickly and smoothly. Takeshi ( I think), the supervisor, was very nice and helpful. The only hiccup for us was when we first checked in, we found out there was a sofa bed in our room, so we mentioned to them we were thinking of using it, but they said they're going to charge extra fee the moment we open the sofa. It didn't make sense to us, what if we just asked for extra bed sheet or blanket and did it ourselves? But anyways, we just dropped it.We didn't get to try the Peninsula Afternoon Tea on the lobby level coz of the ""bad"" timing every time for us, but we tried the buffet breakfast downstairs on the basement level. Although it was delicious and definitely a better quality one out there, but I think they should offer more options/varieties for the price tag. Pastries and desserts were excellent!The gym was nice, it was an OK size, but very clean and quiet. The pool was very nice, the staff on duty were all very nice and helpful, the jacuzzi was super relaxing - it had a bench inside with all the water massage pressure where we could sit and gaze out to the window looking over the Imperial Palace garden. The sauna was amazing! One of the best I've been to, it's rated top 10 or something like that. Complimentary for hotel guests, there were a steam and dry sauna along with the amazing warm and cold herbal infused shower (4 settings)with mood lighting for before and in-between saunas. I could not have enough of the sauna!Location wise, it's about 10 minute walk to Mitsukoshi Dept Store where all the big malls are however Tokyo never sleeps, there are millions of stores, shops, restaurants, café alleys surrounded us. It all depends on what area you want to stay in/ concentrate on, as each prefecture/area has its own characteristics. Metro station is right below us if you choose to take it.Concierge was always very helpful although one particular lady, M, could tone it down a bit and learn to talk/present it differently. We asked for a restaurant recommendation once, then she replied, ""Would you like the high end one or standard one?"". It wasn't rude, I guess, but it took me aback for a sec. But it didn't stop there... I told her to just give me both options, 2, depending on the time, location, or so on, we'd pick as we go. Then when I asked about the difference between the 2 places, she started ""lecturing"" me about how the dish/cuisine is and should be ""in Japan"". I mean I know VERY well about that particular dish/cuisine, in Japan, but what I wanted to know was the difference about the 2 places/restaurants. She was border line rude towards the end as she irritated both me and my husband who is usually very laid back. I don't know what it was, I think it was her lecture tone. I gave her the benefit of the doubt, maybe it's cultural differences though she spoke very fluent English, but then again the rest of the concierge staff didn't talk like her. Anyways, it was a good thing she was only there once the whole time we stayed there. The rest of the hotel staff though was very polite and friendly.Overall, I'd say it was an excellent peninsula stay. I'd definitely recommend staying at The Peninsula Tokyo if you choose to stay in Ginza.","Yorba Linda, California","mluv2travel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorba Linda, California</strong>",53,5.0

Our 5 night stay was very relaxing and of course luxurious. We took the hotel shuttle bus from Narita Airport to the hotel, and from the minute we arrived we were shown what first class service is. Our suitcases and bags were immediately put on the luggage cart trolly and taken to the front desk. Check in was smooth and fast, then we were shown to our room by a wonderful and pleasant concierge. Once in the room she dazzled us with all the amenities,electronic features and comforts which makes the whole Peninsula experience. Bathroom was amazing with the double sinks,T.V., deep bath tub and very large separate shower. Dressing room was a bonus room to have for clothes and suitcases. Room was very quiet and blackout curtains blocked the sun for a restful sleep. The beds had a typical Japanese type mattress not coil and springs that westerners are used to. I had no problem sleeping on a firm mattress.The decor was tastefully done with each room having its own piece of artwork. I should also add that the daily newspaper is left in the valet box in the dressing room. I did read in other reviews complaints of not getting the newspaper. The swimming pool is great to cool off in the hot weather. My son used it a couple of times while we were there. If you go early in the morning it is not as crowed as the afternoon gets. My husband and I checked out Peter's which is the bar on the top floor of the hotel. When we arrived it was towards the end of a happy hour. They had limited appetizers and cocktails at a reduced price. The cocktails were a little unusual but overall it was OK. The only negative comment is smoking is still allowed in many bars in Japan. Peter's is one of the bars that still allows it. Not an enjoyable experience when you are a non smoker sitting next to a chain smoker.:Maybe there should be a no smoking area of the bar to sit.

(Prior to the trip, the hotel was very helpful answering questions, making reservations at restaurants, etc. and always replied promptly to my emails.)The rooms here are outstanding, even the most basic ones, and are quite large, especially by Tokyo standards. The beds were comfortable, and we never heard noise from the hallway or from other rooms, even though the hotel was fully booked. Our only complaint was that the coffee/tea-making equipment didn't work properly and we couldn't get water hot enough to make a decent cup of sencha. Breakfast was included in our room rate and, while good, was nothing special. We had a drink in the bar on the top floor on evening.

Check-in was fast and friendly, door-staff greeted by name on our arrival, the room was immaculate and seemed enormous, partly because of the high ceilings, and partly because it had a massive walk-in closet that was a room unto itself. The bathroom was full of gadgets, and everything was electronically controlled, including black-out shades, which came in handy for jet-lagged travelers in need of sleep. There are also plenty of outlets everywhere which I always appreciate. The whole hotel makes a very elegant, opulent but not-even-remotely-stuffy impression.But the main reason, I think, to stay here is the location: it was perfect for us. I was traveling with my mom and we had never been to Japan before, and from what I had heard from friends who had been to Tokyo I was a little bit worried it would be a bit much for her. It wasn't. The huge shopping area Ginza is right outside the door, and while there's everything there you might conceivably want, and definitely every conceivable designer, it's not as overwhelmingly bright and busy as, say, Shibuya. When we went out on our first day, it didn't feel crazy and it was nice to come back to that area in the evening after the really tourist-y spots in the city. Transportation is easy, too. Hibiya subway station is right under the hotel (the Tokyo subway system is very efficient and simple to figure out) and Tokyo Station with its bullet trains and shopping is a ten minute walk away. Also, our favorite part, the huge Imperial Gardens are right across the street, so if the city gets to be too tiring you can always escape into the green.Overall a really great experience. We're staying at the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo right now, and it's good, too, but there was something special and effortless about The Peninsula.

It is a typical five star Peninsula - sophisticated and nicely appointed with all of the usual perks. The location is suitable for both business and leisure travel. We were upgraded to a very large suite with interesting views of the downtown area. The only drawback for me at this hotel is that the beds are very firm... which is desirable in Japan.

This is a first class hotel but it doesn't quite meet those first class expectations. It is does have an excellent location (A6 exit from nearby Metro station is very convenient). Should you have all your luggage etc, its only about $12 USD by cab from the Tokyo train station (where the Narita express is). There are also lovely Western friendly cafes and restaurants nearby on a tree lined street. Of all four hotels we stayed at in Japan, this hotel had by far the most channels available on the television in English.Our relatively minor complaints:1) The concierge desk. We asked the concierge to cancel a dinner reservation for 2 nights in the future we'd set up as it was far too late for us (9pm). We also asked for a recommendation for an earlier reservation for sushi. We needed to cancel since we still had not adjusted to the time zone as much as we'd thought. The reception at the concierge desk for this relatively simple request was chilly. She did eventually find us a great sushi restaurant but spent much of the time treated us like we are truly crazy for canceling our 9pm reservation. 2) Spotty Wifi Internet. Both hubby and I were continually dropped from the Wifi network on our iPads during simple surfing. 3) Front desk & check out. When you check in, the hotel asks at what time you'll be leaving at check out. We replied at 10:30a, well before the normal checkout. The morning of our check out we decided to leave at noon instead. We stopped by the front desk to alert the staff of our change, told her our room number and we were told that this was no problem. However at 11a when we tried to access our room, the door key was disabled and we had to go back down to the front desk and re-activate our key. This is annoying because it is well before the actual check out time of the hotel and because we had properly notified the front desk of our change. Also upon check out, the line was fairly long although it did move quickly. Give yourself a few extra minutes if checking out at noon for both the front desk and grabbing a cab.It seems silly but these minor complaints are why I'm not sure I'd stay again. We also stayed at the Conrad in Tokyo during our stay and I'd go back there (although I do think that this location is very marginally better than the Conrad). The service in general was very good but not to the exceptional standard that we'd experienced at other 5 star hotels during our stay in Japan.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","Robin R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",61,4.0

The bellman opened the door and my mouth hit the ground I'm sure.The only downside was brunch in the bakery downstairs.

The walk-in closet is the size of most basic Japanese hotel rooms. The shower pressure is good, the bathroom is huge. I love the dumb waiter--you don't have to interact with anyone if that is your wish; there is a sense of privacy and calm throughout this hotel. Prices are not any more than other Peninsula properties, but, the Chinese breakfast at $42 was a little disappointing, although tasty.

The staff are very very professional and almost always find a way to help if you ask them. The concierges give specific and helpful advice about attractions, restaurants and activities. The location is a great jumping off point for many adventures. One special treat we really liked (but wasn't really advertised): if you ask and if it is available, the hotel's posh Rolls Royce will give you a one-way ride to the fish market. Another suggestion, don't pass up on trying the pool; it is a great design and they treat you like royalty.My minor complaints don't detract from the overall experience, but are worth mentioning just for full disclosure-sake. As many other reviewers have said, the lobby restaurant is truly part of the lobby and it feels a little funny to either eat or walk through. In addition, I was not a huge fan of the hotel bar called 'Peter'. It seemed to try a little too hard to look 'cool', but this may just be a matter of taste. Besides, it has an amazing view.Overall, this hotel earns its reputation as one of the best in the world. The opportunities for pampering and luxury abound.

I must say that I will fondly remember this bathroom as one of the top 3 I have seen in the world. The dressing room is large and is great to store your clothes and luggages and to keep the room tidy. The bedroom is very large and we had a nice view of the Imperial Gardens on the second stay.

Originally we had booked the the Grand Deluxe room with supposedly an amazing view of the Imperial Palace. However upon arriving we asked for the cost of an upgrade and were told that we would get a special rate of half the price it normally would be to upgrade. The one nit that I would have (which the front desk also made very clear to us) is that the suite we upgraded to has city view in the corner of the hotel facing the railway. There was also construction going on so from certain angles the was not the best. I would recommend that if you were to upgrade to a suite to make sure you are not facing the railway.

Peninsula had a nice balance of comfortable dark woods everywhere without coming across as too business-y which was the issue I had with Mandarin Oriental. You walk into to an expansive living room with a dining table, sofa and TV. The room controls at the Peninsula were far superior than any hotel I have ever been in. Usually figuring out how to turn on the lights, close the curtains, change the temperature can be slightly confusing even at the nicest hotels. The Peninsula has clear and easy to understand labels in every room. Th curtains had double blackout blinds so when closed, absolutely no light gets in. The controls also include displays of the outside temperature including humidity and wind speed! The phones and electronics were all motion sensitive so will light up when you approach it. Everything like the coffee machine, TV in the bedroom were tucked away behind wooden shutters. When you turn left from the hallway you enter a large closet with a enormous bench for placing your luggage on top and below combined with a dressing room with a vanity table. This room leads to the larger bathroom and bedroom. BedroomOne of the most comfortable beds I've had on my entire trip. You have the option to change pillows if the ones you have are unsatisfactory. As mentioned before, the TV is tucked behind a wooden screen along with the DVD player. The windows also have double curtains keeping out all light. BathroomThere were two! One toilet in the hallway upon entering the room and one full bathroom past the dressing room. The full bathroom was wonderful with a large tub that had s stone faucet and large window overlooking the city. A separate shower had wonderful water pressure and easy to figure out and use. Plenty of towels and plenty of places to hang your towels (usually an issue at most hotels). A full drawer of amenities (sewing kit, comb, etc) all packaged in Peninsula boxes. LocationGreat location. Right in the backyard is Yakitori alley with tons of great Yakitori places. Being a night owl, it was great to find out that some of these places stay open on weekends 24x7. Further down you get into the major shopping area of Ginza. ServiceHousekeeping was great. Turn down service every day unless you have your privacy light on. They will come in and close the curtains etc. Concierge was much better than the Mandarin Oriental. I used concierge at both extensively to get restaurant reservations because many restaurants in Tokyo do not take reservations from overseas. The Peninsula concierge was efficient and presented your requests in a very clear manner versus the Mandarin Oriental sent very confusing and unclear messages. PoolOne of the best city pools I have ever been in. The pool was Olympic sized and they provide you with towels, water, and slippers upon arrival. Huge floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city with lounge chairs set up facing the window. Large hot tub is set up right next to a window so you can watch the sunset while you relax in the hot tub. Did not try the room service or the restaurants but did go upstairs to the bar which was very beautifully decorated. If you want to throw away some cash there is a watch store, Graff, and various high end clothing stores downstairs in the hotel. Overall a wonderful stay. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.","Los Angeles, California","TravelInEase</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",60,5.0

Several main subways have direct access to the hotel. Many major shopping departments and marvelous restaurants are just in walking distance, that include either the high end or the budget affordable eateries. Multi languages hotel staff is very friendly and provides all the adequate informations whenever needed. Rooms are on good size with a huge dressing area. Cleanliness is not a problem at all with my super picky taste. The cake shop at the basement is a must visit if you are a big dessert fan. Or even just to look at all the desserts would satisfy someone's desire.Their Chinese restaurant, Hei Fung Terrace, serves the best Chinese food in Tokyo and with a very nice ambience and elegant style.Plus, Peter serves wonderful grilled items and Peter beer is a must try since it's exclusively made in Hokkaido for this restaurant .There's only one small negative point is that breakfast at the Lobby needs some improvements on their Japanese style breakfast sets. Also the Internet connection is very slow and sometimes even disconnected in the middle of usage. I had to get up very very early to get my works done to avoid the problems.Toiletries are from Oscar de la Renta which are served at the Peninsula hotels in the very recent years!Hotel limousines are very expensive.

The art works and general art theme are interesting, especially the ""black hole"" stretching over all floor to be viewed from the elevator landings.The top floor restaurant has nice views, pleasant service and comfort food options, but the smoke from the nearby bar is perceptible.The spa looks gorgeous as the large overheated (30°C) pool comes with a view. Attendants are kind but sticky and will insist you put a swimming cap, despite no such rules are posted (and according to the very kind spa manager neither enforced). This would still be acceptable if they had the correct size for my large (and bald) head, which was not the case and made me feel very uncomfortable. The next day I swam without which provoked a big fuzz. If you go there, by all means: Swim without cap and ignore the obnoxious attendants. You are at what is an international hotel brand.Possibly smoking and hysteria about hygiene are common pleas of Japan - but other properties may handle these issues better than The Peninsula.Stay rather at the Four Seasons near the main station- they have no pool, so no issues...:-).","Bern, Switzerland","behuman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bern, Switzerland</strong>",107,3.0

Very often, the users of these lifts will have to fight for space with the people at the front desk. One thing that guests need to be aware is the unannounced occupation of the lobby by wedding marches. The hotel does not give their guests advance warning of these events. The lobby also does not provide any proper seating in the lobby for its guests.

Again, a beautiful space recalling rustic Cantonese settings. Relaxing and fun.* lobby restaurant was actually quite good for a bustling breakfast in the soaring space. Tried the Chinese, Japanese and Western breakfasts. All were terrific with excellent service.* spa and gym were superb as expected at a Peninsula.

The room design/facilities are fantastic, but I won't go into that as much has been said already.Housekeeping service is top class, down to the smallest details. Phone and laptop chargers left in a tangled mess were neatly rolled up, T-shirts tossed on the sofa were folded with origami precision. First night of my stay requested an extra bucket of ice, and on subsequent nights there was always 2 buckets of ice waiting when I got back to the room. Likewise, after calling once for extra drinking water, extra water was placed in my room every day.Concierge staff were exceptionally helpful and knowledgeable. Dealt with 3 different concierge staff during my stay, and all knew their stuff. One day I wanted to go shopping/walking in Shibuya, Harajuku, Shinjuku areas, but no idea where to go as was my first trip to Tokyo. Concierge took some time to draw on a map a suggested walking route, advised when best to use the subway or take a taxi, which subway exits to use, and marking which streets on the map were best for shopping, restaurants, or bars. I asked about a particular item I was interested in buying, and he immediately knew the store and marked it on the map. Seriously, if staying at the Peninsula no need to do any prior research yourself, just ask the concierges. Those guys know everything!Also, if you have breakfast included in your room rate, no need to go downstairs to the restaurant within the appointed breakfast hours, you can order it in your room at any time, which is what I did. You will be charged a service charge for this, 15% from memory, but it’s a small price to pay for the convenience of eating in your room or if you like to sleep past official breakfast hours.

We go through the revolving doors and at once are escorted to the check-in desk. The Peninsula brand has definitely made its name from their excellent hospitality and service, but the Peninsula Tokyo takes on an innovative approach to stand out from other luxury hotels in the area. Aligned with the Japanese fascination of technology, the Peninsula Tokyo embraces this very character in the guest rooms. The room has every touch of high tech and luxury amenities that make our stay very special.The walk-in closet is spacious especially by Tokyo standards. Any hotel that adds in important details, however seemingly trivial, for female guests has a special place in my heart. At the dresser in front of the mirror is a cushioned seat for makeup application. An in-built nail dryer is also present at the side for her to paint her nails before a night out in town. As if not not pampering enough, there is also an in-built radio controls at the dresser for me to select my entertainment while I apply my makeup. Listening to a mix of J-pop and American music before a night out at Ginza- I think that's a win situation. In the closet drawer is a set of comfortable yukata (Japanese robe) for us to change into once we're back in the room.In the morning, we open our valet box to retrieve the newspapers delivered to our room, an accompaniment for our Lavazza espresso made from the machine in the room. There's a 2-seater dining table already laid with silverware and plates that we sit at every morning.The room, bathroom, and bathtub have in-built electric controls in the wall for lights, radio, and TV. In the shower, we have both rain shower and handheld shower. When the toilet bowl is not used after awhile, the seat cover automatically comes down to cover the seat. As someone approaches the toilet bowl, the sensor senses it and the seat cover automatically comes up. As part of the toilet bowl controls, one can choose if the seat itself be lifted up with the seat cover or not, once again taking into consideration if the user is female or male. There's always a fascination among T and I with how even toilet functions embrace the Japanese' love of technology. The Peninsula Tokyo takes the technology and combines it with luxury that is offered to its guests.Our bed area and sitting room are spacious for a deluxe room. The light switch on the wall illuminates when we approach so that we can actually see the switch itself when it's dark or dim. At night, the alarm and light switch on the bedside table also illuminate with a dim glow when we touch the table or put something on the table. Every evening when we return to our room, we are welcomed by the already completed turn down service with bedroom slippers and bottled water on each side of the bed.","Chicago, Illinois","terinay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",104,5.0

From the bellman to the woman who holds the door or spins the revolving door to the front desk man that not only checked us in but led us to our room. During our trip we stayed at 5 different hotels (in California and Japan) and this was by the far the biggest. There were three rooms total:Bathroom: Huge bathroom with a separate glassed area for the toilet, a tub, and a shower. The shower has a rain shower head in the ceiling along with a regular shower head in the wall that's adjustable. The bath tub is terrific. It has a waterfall faucet and next to it are controls, one of which is a spa button. The spa button will dim the lights and play soothing, spa like music. The toilet has all of the buttons you'd expect from a Japanese toilet. During our stay I realized that this is pretty normal even in many public bathrooms. There is also a radio, phone, and tv as well. Walk-in closet: HUGE walk-in closet. I don't even know if I saw everything that was kind of ""hidden"" in the closet. But there is a vanity, lots of drawers and places to hang things, a hair dryer, and a place to put stuff for the valet so he can do dry cleaning or shoe shining. Bedroom/living space: There is a bed on one side and they laid out slippers and robe on each side of the bed. Also the phone was pretty impressive because it gave not only the time and weather but also had the time for our home, which was incredibly convenient. On the opposite side is a couch, tv, desk. mini-bar, and a small table with chairs. There were two apples with plates and silverware set up on the table. The bottled water was free and the ice bucket was filled, both were replenished whenever we left the room. There was also an espresso machine which I didn't try to use, it looked kind of complicated. There were multiple panels around the room that controlled the blinds and lighting. When the blinds were closed it was pretty much completely dark.I was impressed by how the front desk person always seemed to remember my name and everyone was very friendly. There was usually no hard time finding someone so we could ask for directions or information, many of them spoke very good English.The area around the hotel is nice, kind of posh. If you need to get your JR East Pass, I'd recommend getting it at the airport. Otherwise you need to go to the Tokyo Station, which is walkable but not too close. It's also a HUGE station and we needed to walk across it to get to the tourist center. We just had to show the guy at the desk our paperwork to show where we were going, he gave us a piece of paper and then we walked across the station to the OTHER entrance and showed the piece of paper again. Overall I loved this hotel, it was one of the nicest I've ever stayed in. Yes it's expensive and we chose to only stay there for 2 nights during the first left of our trip, but it was well worth the experience, especially if you're recovering from jet lag and end up spending a little more time in your room.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Athena732</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",70,5.0

Its small lobby reception area is a circular space, about 40' in diameter, that sits in the middle of the restaurant. Not the image of luxury and class one expects at a property of this caliber.Despite being confirmed for an early check-in, we had to wait about 30 min. for a room.Our luggage had been sent ahead from Kyoto and at check-in the attentive reception clerk acknowledged it had been received. Yet it took about two hours to have it delivered to our room. (By comparison, we had made similar arrangements in Kyoto and when we arrived at our hotel room the luggage had already been delivered. This, in a hotel that was below the Penninsula's level luxury, service and expense.)The registration clerk at check-in asked which newspaper we would like in the morning, but the following day the paper was never delivered.The only two bright points were the eagerly attentive staff and the sleek modern rooms. And they deserve a star for each one. The bar on the top floor was superb and provided spectacular views of the city. The overall quality of the service, however, left a lot to be desired and certainly did not provide good value.

Hotel is located in Ginza, right next to the imperial palace, Tokyo station, lots of nice eateries, parks and of course shopping. Check in was quick, smooth and got upgraded to deluxe park view. So far the most luxury hotel room I have stayed in. The way the room is set up, deluxe room feels like a suite. If you are gadget geek like me then this is a paradise for you. The room is completely automated from controlling humidity level in the room to internet radio of your preference. Big and separate walk in closet, huge bathroom, stone bathtub with mood lighting and spa features which was fantastic to use after long day. Pool was excellent with hot-tub looking into the imperial garden and outside balcony to chill if you get too hot. Dinning on the other hand was hit and miss. While the bar on the 24 floor was great place to end the day with a nice drink and fantastic view of Ginza, the lobby restaurant where the breakfast is served was located in the middle of lobby and the entrance to the hotel was through the restaurant which felt more like food court then restaurant of 5 star hotel. Hotel does not offer buffet breakfast, only a la cart and staff during breakfast gets busy, overworked and stressed, which resulted to take long time to get the orders. Except the breakfast (though it was not a major issue) loved my stay and had wonderful time in Peninsula. Small tip for those of you who are planing to do shopping - make sure you have your passport for tax free. Unfortunately stores require the passport and do not take photocopies. The highlight of this trip was the visit to Robot Restaurant, while the food was awful, the show was fantastic and had fun night.

It is located in central Tokyo in the Marunouchi district and the Hibuya subway stop is right at the entrance of the hotel. The hotel is actually right next to a few subway and train stations so it is extremely easy to navigate to anywhere in Tokyo from this hotel. Also since the hotel is fairly well known, it’s easy to find on the city maps when trying to find your way around.I had taken the JR Narita Express from the Narita airport to the Tokyo Station and transferred there to the JR Yamanote Line to the next stop at the Yurakucho Station where I would be walking to the hotel. The Yurakucho station is right across the street from the hotel itself and I have to say that walking around with my suitcase trying to find the hotel wasn’t too horrible since it wasn’t too far away from the station.The hotel registration desk is set a little far back in the lobby of the hotel (to the left of the big eye sculpture in the lobby) and the hotel elevators are to the right of the hotel registration area. To the left of the hotel registration desk is the concierge desk and the bell desk is to the left once you enter the hotel from the front doors.When I arrived, numerous people asked to take my suitcase which was surprising as everyone wanted to be so helpful. When helped at the desk, they asked for my name and when I mentioned I was staying with my friend who had already arrived the night before, they said they already knew about me and quickly looked up the room and provided me my key. The service was amazingly top notch.The room itself was absolutely beautiful. We had a superior room and there was a huge walk-in closet with plenty of space for both of us and our bags. The closet had a vanity along with a nail dryer and safe. There is also a valet box in the closet and you could send your items down to be cleaned and delivered to your room later. Kimonos are provided along with huge fluffy white bathrobes. The spacious bathroom had two sinks and the toilet, of course, was automated. Neither of us used the huge bathtub in the bathroom but the shower was roomy. There was a rain shower head and a removable shower head but I would find out that when I used both at the same time, it was just too much water flowing at me. There is a nice coffee/espresso machine in the room and it was delicious. I usually do not have coffee every morning but for this machine, it was a shame to not do so. The hotel provided turndown service every night and the beds were extremely comfortable. The hotel internet provided was reliable and quick.I did go use the gym here and it was located on the 6th floor of the hotel. You enter at the spa area and head downstairs (and get a beautiful view of the pool area) to the gym facilities. There are many cardio machines and strength weight machines. They also have dumbbells and yoga mats to use. Cold towels and water is provided along with some fruit for nourishment. I was usually the only one using the gym when I was down there but the staff would periodically walk through to make sure the gym had enough water and was neat.There is a hotel bar/restaurant located near the top of the hotel named Peter and we went there one night for drinks and the view. It is pretty up there but as being from California, I had to adjust to having people smoke indoors next to me at the bar. Drinks were pricey as expected but it was a low-key atmosphere. For other food in the hotel, there is a restaurant in the lobby to dine at and there is a bakery/cafe on a lower level of the hotel. I stopped by the bakery but did not want anything at the time although the treats looked delicious. There is also a Citibank ATM downstairs and a business center to print items out.The hotel is across from the Imperial Palace so it’s a good location if you want to run around the area since there are many parks and walking trails right across the street. We walked to Ginza Street from our hotel once night and the Ginza corridor is nearby for many authentic Japanese restaurants.Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel as the service, location, and amenities were the best I had experienced. Any of the staff we encountered were very kind and being a business oriented hotel, there was a lot of western influence mingled with traditional culture. Everyone I had encountered spoke at least a little bit of English here so it wasn’t difficult to have help with anything you needed.

As other reviewers have noted, the rooms are large, and the separate dressing room is wonderful. It is larger than a couple hotel rooms I have stayed in in Europe. The king size bed was luxurious, as was the bathroom, with his and her vanity units on either side of a large bath. It also featured a separate shower and of course the well-known multi-function toilet.The electronics in the room take a little getting used to. At night, touch the bedside table, and the control panel illuminates. The air conditioning system features humidity control, as well as temperature. Papers are delivered to a valet box, which illuminates when anything is deposited. This is a great idea, as it minimizes the inconvenience associated with having staff doorknock for pick up and delivery of washing, and shoes to be shined.The only reservation I have about the property is its Lobby. It is small, and has only two opposed bench seats for people to sit on. The rest of the floor space is occupied by a coffee shop/restaurant, with only a narrow thoroughfare for guests. The hotel does host a lot of weddings, apparently...there were 3 when I was there. It becomes a dysfunctional space when crowded with wedding guests, photographers etc. Otherwise, everything worked, the hotel was very quiet once you left the Lobby, and the ability to black out the room with electrically-controlled blinds and a hewn solid timber door between the bedroom and the rest of the room was much appreciated.

A beautiful ritual steeped in tradition, afternoon tea is a signature feature at each Peninsula around the world. Before the three-tier set is served, guests will be served a choice of tea or coffee. Most certainly, tea is highly recommended and the wide range here includes the classic tea selection featuring tea from the Peninsula hotel brand, herbal tea selection as well as Harney & Sons fine tea selection. Harney & Sons is an American craft tea brand since 1983 and I enjoyed their Green Tea with Thai flavours (the Thai ingredient seemed to be lemongrass) Among the starters, the Shrimp and egg salad wrap was a moreish delight with spiced creamy mashed egg wrapped in a yellow crepe skin that surprisingly contained nostalgic taste of curry. I also like the Yuzu marinated salmon and white radish cocktail which resembled an refined pickled dish with bright sour flavours. Who says salmon must always go with cream cheese and dill? Lying besides the roasted bell pepper quiche is a Pink sandwich specially created for the Pink Breast Cancer Awareness campaign. The combination of corned beef, roasted beet and lemon cream is quite an adventurous idea that would realize its full potential if the beef had not been too sinewy. As mentioned earlier, The Peninsula Tokyo shows its support for Breast Cancer Awareness Month every October by staging ""Peninsula in Pink"" as part of a group-wide campaign of the Peninsula Hotels to raise both awareness and funds. A percentage of the proceeds raised goes to local breast cancer-related charities. In line with the theme of pink, the spread of desserts dominated by pink, white and red colors. Classic mousse cakes include the Raspberry and white chocolate mousse and La Foret noire (Blackforest cake) whose cherries were well soaked but not overly done to the extent of drenching the entire cake. Most European cakes that contained citrus peels tend to be extra sweet because the peels are concentrated with sugar but not for this Grapefruit pound cake. The bitterness of the peels here was forthcoming, and thus it took me some time to get accustomed to the taste. Hence, I prefer the Rhubarb tart, which has an excellent pastry base that never fails to put a smile on my face. But it was the homemade scones that I enjoyed bits by bits till the end of the course because they were simply terrific. Both the organic plain and raisin scones were those old-fashioned kinds with a sturdy wall that collapsed upon a bite. These were especially mesmerizing with the clotted cream and raspberry compote. The Afternoon Tea menu changes every season and be sure to avoid weekends and national holidays unless you do not mind queuing with the Japanese ladies. The selection might not be the most extensive one but it sure leaves one full and satisfied. And with the beautiful live piano music playing in the background, one can easily forget about the time and the busy crowds outside in Ginza.

Sadly it didn't live up to expectations! The reception staff are unfriendly, not particularly helpful and stoney faced. The room itself was very nice and had every mod con that you would expect. The lobby is were you have breakfast and is an uncomfortable place to sit and eat. It can get cold if you are near the door and is a very busy thoroughfare so not condusive to having a relaxed meal. The breakfast staff were shambolic - lot's of them and nobody knowing who has done what. The food served at breakfast was disappointing to say the least - if you order a bakery basket you are given 1 slice of toast, 1 croissant and 1 danish pastry per person and the orange juice is not freshly squeezed. As you can imagine it's not cheap to eat there and it feels like they are economising on what should be a substantial meal for the money you pay. The spa has nice facilities but again hugely expensive and very average treatments.

A lot of new inventory has cropped up and some of it is great but the Peninsula is still my favorite. Let's see if I can add anything different from the last review. First, the location is great. The location is diagonally across a little park and walking distance away from the heart of Ginza. Also, the staff remain fabulously trained on all levels. Japan in general is a super clean country but this hotel's housekeeping really takes it to a new level. I wear white socks in the room and they remain white for the whole stay. The room service is excellent and they keep expanding the menu to meet the international guest profiles. I don't think I can say anything negative. Here's a great story that kind of sums up it all up. Once, about 2-1/2 years ago, I asked that they stop delivering the newspaper so early in the morning, it comes about 4 am or so and I am a light sleeper and it woke me up to hear the valet box being opened and closed. Since then, I have NEVER had this problem again. That is really remarkable to anyone who stays in hotels often.

Wanted to stay somewhere comfortable in Tokyo in a fairly central location. Chose The Peninsula, due to the reviews on Trip Advisor. I was not disappointed.First, the rooms are elegant and extremely practical. The rooms are essentially a suite of 3 rooms, living, dressing, bathroom. The furnishings and fixtures are of the highest quality and the decor is Japanese simple with luxury elegance and functionality. Colors are calming and peaceful, I felt like I was in a spa resort, not in the middle of Tokyo.Being a 5-star property, they had all of the required services and amenities you would need in such an establishment. I agree with one other reviewer, the Lobby is a little unusual. As you come through the revolving doors, an open-air restaurant is laid out on both side of the lobby, where you would imagine the front desk, etc., should be. Instead the front desk is past the restaurant just prior to the elevator banks. It isn't unattractive or a negative, but I found myself wanting a lounging area or bar area to sit around in when I wasn't in the room; a place to just relax, but in this case all of the space is used by the restaurant.Nonetheless, the hotel is located very centrally, with lots of things to do and places to eat or go within a block or less from the front door. The Ginza shopping area is literally out the door and two blocks up to the left. Very nice area. The main Tokyo station is also about a 15 minute walk from the hotel, which wasn't bad, even for a couch potato like me.All in all, this is a very special hotel, specifically because of the rooms, they are comfortable, practical and wonderfully relaxing. The technology in the room was amazing and welcomed, as I have a home automation system myself, so it was nice to have central control of the blinds, entertainment and lighting systems.Outside of the room, things are a little spread out and somewhat disconnected. The bar and another restaurant are on the 24th floor, which is a walk around the inside of the hotel to a separate bank of elevators, which to me was somewhat inconvenient; and, as mentioned, there were no comfort areas to just sit and relax.I also used the spa services, which were fantastic. Had a massage, which was a good start to my vacation. The Therapist was outstanding. The spa is very well appointed with a very nice sauna area that also has two hot/cold shower areas for dunking or being rained on in this case. it was very nice.Loved my stay.","Houston, Texas","Roger N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",55,5.0

The rooms are just outstanding; in fact it may well be the best hotel room my wife and I have ever stayed in.Sadly we only had a one night stay, our room was on the 22nd floor with great views over the Imperial Palace and grounds. The room was large and spacious, complete with sitting area. There was a great walk in robe area as well as an enormous bathroom with the shower and toilet neatly divided off behind frosted glass panels.The décor was outstanding, muted colours set off lots of use of wood, the main bedroom door was just the most amazing sliding wooden door. The technical gizmos in this room are equally amazing, there is a button for everything you can think of, and buttons for things you had not thought of – when was the last time you were in a hotel room that had a panel that included a display of outside temperature, wind speed and wind direction? I promise you, it’s true! There is also a printer/ fax machine provided.The rest of the hotel is architecturally quite interesting, one large void is cleverly put to use to display an interesting illuminated artwork. Décor is subtle, maybe a little too dark and muted for some tastes, but I liked it.We ate with friends in the ‘Peter’ restaurant on the 24th floor. It was expensive. but you are really paying for the ambiance and view, both of which are great. Service was impeccable of course, the one small minus we encountered were the arrangements for breakfast. The ground floor area used for breakfast is really not large enough to accommodate everybody at peak time. We went down at about 8.25am and it was full, we were asked to come back 15 minutes later, which we did and by then there was lots of space! Odd, but really only a small black mark given how great everything else was.Overall an outstanding hotel that totally gets my seal of approval.","Cleveland, Australia","jcbdigger</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cleveland, Australia</strong>",34,5.0

Everything about the hotel experience was spectacular, particularly the hospitality from the staff.Several weeks prior to arrival I contacted the concierge team to ask for assistance with restaurant reservations, particularly for a 'special occasion' meal for my birthday. Once I had the right contact info, the team was very responsive, providing recommendations and suggestions in addition to the properties about which I had enquired. Reservations were secured, confirmations transmitted, and a nice packet of information was waiting on check-in with all the details: times, locations, maps, and descriptions.I was also pleasantly surprised that we received a room upgrade, and stayed in a beautiful suite with views of Hibiya Park, the Imperial Palace gardens, and adjacent neighborhood. There were even a selection of small-bite pastries and a bottle of wine waiting with a Happy Birthday message. Nice extra touches that made the stay that much more memorable.I love the technology integration of the Peninsula rooms, although I was disappointed not to have the ability (at least that I could discover) to dock my iPhone and access my own music through the room's speakers.As others have mentioned, the central location is very convenient from which to explore the city. The hotel was an easy taxi ride from Tokyo Station from which one can access Narita Express to the airport, and being right above the Hibiya Station subway stop the whole of the city is essentially at your doorstep. The Ginza and Marounuchi are easily explored on foot.We found the lobby breakfast to be very good - I particularly enjoyed the caramelized French Toast - as was lunch at Hei Fung Terrace. We wanted to try the bar at Peter for cocktails, but were turned away because it was full. That was about the only truly negative aspect of the stay, and did leave a bit of a bad impression mainly because there was no attempt at accommodation, simply a 'we're full' and a refusal to even be allowed to stand at the bar. It was just a very stark contrast to the ""above and beyond"" nature we encountered from the rest of the staff.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","crewguydc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",10,5.0

The presence of the breakfast and tea lounge in the entranceway is an odd layout, and the hotel seemed overly somber in decor and lighting. I arrived late and left early, which in and of itself is not conducive to developing fully informed view. However, some months later I returned for a four-day stay (i.e. availability at other hotels over a weekend was limited) and I became a big fan. The Peninsula this time seemed to me an idyllic spot with a host of comforts I didn't previously appreciate. The rooms are spartan and modern (I had a junior suite with a nice sofa, work area) with easy to use conveniences for setting temperature, lighting and operating the shades. Plug outlets were universal, although I would have appreciated a plug next to the bed/nightstand for charging my phone nee alarm clock. The closet area is enormous with ample storage for unpacking and repacking. Services are moderately priced such as laundry, which is important to me as I dislike being nickled and dimed to death. The spa facility is truly first class with a wonderful steam/sauna facility and an ample pool for those who like to swim laps on business trips. Service is of course first class, and the location is ideal for both access to Ginza and other areas of the city. Although the food is quite good - as you would expect in any high-end hotel in Japan - I found the lack of variety in the menu disappointing. The room service is a bit short on traditional Japanese fare and lacks any asian foods (e.g. singapore noodles, a laksa or nasi goreng, perhaps a lo-mein dish or a bibimbap), while the Japanese breakfast is repetitive (i.e. same fish for three days in a row, though I am sure it was because it was in season). The western options are a bit unimaginative (i.e. I recall the international trifecta of hotel food: caesar and/or cobb salad, bolognese pasta dish and a burger among other expected fare). With such high quality establishments nearby, I wouldn't expect the hotel to stake its reputation too much on its kitchen, but with 3 am jet lag, I would have liked some more choice. But overall I find the Peninsula to be a wonderful establishment with all of the conveniences and comforts you should expect. It is both modern and classy, the staff is helpful and communicative and the services are wonderful.","Moscow, Russia","Joshua T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Moscow, Russia</strong>",9,5.0

They were able to get us a last minute table at Narisawa and also booked us into an exclusive sushi joint where we were the only westerners in the restaurant-- definitely the best sushi we ever had. They also gave us a ride to my husband's dinner in the house Rolls Royce. Our room was lovely and quiet and a nice escape from the chaos of Tokyo and the bathroom had all the bells and whistles you expect from a 5* resort in Asia.

Central location, right above a subway stop, beautiful, new, great service, and great views. One weird thing about the hotel is its entry lobby; we couldn't find the reception desk upon entering the hotel for the first time. The main focus of the lobby is the lobby restaurant (which is packed for afternoon tea), and this huge odd sculpture. For such a nice hotel, staff wore polo knit shirts, which (not that it impacted our stay at all!) seemed a little casual. Service was great. Rooms were beautiful, plush, and modern with high tech features and controls. We went to the Peter bar upstairs twice, and the views were beautiful (though, in my opinion, not quite as beautiful as those from the Mandarin's bar and top floors!). We could certainly highly recommend this as an amazing stay, but when we visited the Mandarin for dinner and drinks, we had a bit of hotel envy. As westerners who wanted what we imagined to be a Tokyo feel, the Mandarin seemed to fit the vibe a bit more...

You can see from my profile I get around, but that superlative also includes other great hotels which I haven't reviewed, such as the Four Seasons HK, the Pierre in NYC, Park Hyatt Zurich (my #2) and others around the world. Even amongst steep competition, the Penn TKY stands alone.The rooms are extraordinary. Beautifully designed with wood and marble accents and sporting ample room by any standards, they feature an element lacking in standard luxe rooms around the world - a sofa. And not some straight back banquette or settee, but an honest-to-goodness sink into the cushions sofa. No comfy desk chair or chaise can compare with the simple pleasure of plopping down on a real sofa at the end of the day and watching a wacky Japanese game show. This alone is reason to pick the Penn over nearly every other hotel. If you have stayed at Peninsulas, you may be familiar with their exceptional, even extraordinary, control layout. Lights, temp, shades, are all controlled by easily understood switches which are in the exact places you would look for them. Outside temp and humidity is helpfully displayed in both the closet and desk areas, The bedside phone (phone*s*, actually, since there is one on each side) controls a few key items, and has a very simple alarm function. The bathroom TV and speakerphone are all controlled from both the sink area AND the tub. The walk-in closet is something to behold. Two hanging bars divided by a vanity (even a nail dryer...) with a safe you don't need to bend to get into, and a valet box into which you can dump your laundry for overnight pickup. All genius.The bathroom is gorgeous in beige marble, with a massive tub, ample shower, two sinks with plenty of space. And, brace yourself, a Toto washlet. These are standard across Japan (JAL has even installed them in Business Class Lavatories), but they will change your life. Way more practical than a bidet, and also more effective. The lid rises to greet you in the middle of the dark, dark night, beckoning you to a pre-warmed seat, and sports a odor-reducing function that actually works. I know of at least three friends who, after their Penninsula experience, have installed these in their homes. Service is exceptional, and in Japan it is tip-free. Housekeeping somehow manages to provide ice at all timesRoom service is usurous, of course, but excellent and prompt. Breakfast will run you about $25 an egg, but that's the breaks in luxe hotels. There is a 7/11 across the street if you want to save money.Location is perfect. The rooms overlook some section of the Imperial Palace or adjacent park, and the shops and restaurants of Ginza are just a few blocks away.The overall hotel is, predictably, beautiful. The public spaces are impressive and calming, and the top floor steakhouse/bar has a commanding view of the palace and skyline. The pool/spa/gym are stunning and well-staffed.Nits? Ok, if you force me to name some: no breakfast buffet, the shower door is so flush to the floor that the bathmat always gets caught, I'm too fat for the robes. Also, and this is a nit I have to pick with Japan in general, getting decaf coffee is next to impossible. The in-room Lavazza machine (genius!) is stocked nightly with both espresso and grand cafe pods, but decaf has to be ordered up from housekeeping. OK, so they show up in 2 minutes with a big smile, but i wish they would have made a note on my housekeeping form so I could get it during the regular cleaning cycle. Not a one of these little complaints amounts to anything other than a minor frustration.I know everyone wants to have their ""Lost in Translation"" moment at the PH across town, but for me, I'll have a drink at the PH New York bar, but I'll never leave the Peninsula.",westport,"screwjack</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>westport</strong>",129,5.0

The bed is comfortable although the pillows are a bit soft, the light and air con remote control and telephone system by the bed are motion sensored so you can adjust anything even in the dark!

The pool is pretty big with nice views and the spa was pretty good (typical great Japanese service). They also have jogging routes around the park in front or around the palace, really nice if you are jetlagged. The hotel is connected to the Ginza underground station, you can directly take the lift down to the station which was super convenient. The Airport Limousine bus goes directly to the hotel and has a frequent schedule, however, the schedule going from hotel to Narita Airport (takes about 1.5 hours rather than the usual 1 hour as the limousine bus stops at other hotels as well) is not always every hour so you need to check and buy tickets from the transportation desk in advance.

Lovely lobby and a great place for breakfast; English, American and Japanese options all available. The highlight of the hotel is probably the staff. Super attentive, they can do anything quickly and efficiently the instant you ask, and the multiple concierges even had a little bit of humour which is unusual for Japanese when speaking English. Very resourceful, and willing to do anything for you.A major bonus about the Pen is the location too. On the edge of Ginza, there is everything from high end stores (anything from GAP to Gucci is far better than any branch you will find in the world), and useful stores such as Tokyo Hands and the wonderful Itoya stationery store. One thing that doesn't seem to be touted at all and is incredibly useful is that the hotel is actually connected to Ginza underground station; just a trip down to the basement from the lift by your room and you are straight into the station, which is perfect if you're trying to avoid taxis as Tokyo can get very pricey. Top floor bar Peter's (a bit of an ego trip - in true Penisula style the manager has a lot of influence on the hotel) is absolutely fabulous for a night cap with great cocktails, Veuve on tap and smoking (which is actually illegal on the streets immediately surrounding the hotel). The view isn't anything on the Park Hyatt - which is so worth a visit - but the bar is a cosier one than any of the other major hotels in the city. Absolutely fab stay for what was a very quick two nights, would not return anywhere else on a second trip to Tokyo! The Pen is not flashy, and doesn't have quite the same Lost in Translation aura as many of the others, but its subtlety and perfectness gives it an atmosphere of it's own.Stayed 16th - 19th August, Room 1313, many thanks to all of the staff.","London, United Kingdom","SebDarke</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

The rooms at the Peninsula are amongst the largest in Tokyo, ideal if you're traveling with young children.Its location in Chiyoda is very central, walking distance to Ginza for great shopping and dining and a short taxi drive from Tokyo Station and other areas in central Tokyo, so a great base to explore the city from.Besides being very spacious, both times our rooms offered nice views over the city, had block-out curtains and no noise, which is just what we needed traveling in from different time zones! Although it's a business hotel, the hotel caters very well to children. Upon arrival we had lots of welcome kids amenities including toys, kids bathroom slippers, a children's robe, little step for the bathroom as well as juice and cookies, which made our daughter feel very welcome and special. The first time we stayed we had a roll-away bed for her, the second time they used the sofa as the third bed. A nice gesture was that housekeeping would fold away the bed in the morning and come back late afternoon to make it up again, leaving you to enjoy the lounge area of your room during the day.The rooms are very high tech from the toilets to the light switches, curtains and room controls and it all works! The room even had a nail dryer, haven't seen that before! The bathroom was large, with two separate sinks, bath and rain shower. Our room also had a large dressing room, perfect to store suitcases and unpack, especially when traveling with children.The service in the hotel was excellent and very friendly. The concierge assisted us with train bookings, tickets, restaurant recommendations, and check-in and out was smooth and efficient. The hotel has a good gym, a nice spa and an indoor pool (open for children until 6pm, not sure why this is though).My only comment is the breakfast service. We had breakfast included in our room rate, but only for 2 people although our daughter stayed with us in our room which was odd and impractical. The lobby lounge is the place for a la carte breakfast and although the food is very nice, the service was slow most mornings and breakfast choices limited as the breakfasts were set menus with little flexibility. On some days the restaurant on the 2nd floor is open for breakfast as well (buffet style) but the service there was very slow and most mornings we had to ask five or six times for our coffees which then arrived after we had finished most of our meal. The buffet selection is limited compared to other high end luxury hotels.We loved our stay both times and would definitely come back to the Peninsula when we're next in Tokyo.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","AnneDubai20111</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",127,5.0

Excellent service, beautiful rooms (actually the entire hotel is beautiful), and the location is also fantastic. Easy to walk around for hours in the area. We were able to get around all of Tokyo very easily from the hotel, as it has its own entrance to a metro station. Its close to the fish market, too! So, if you're willing to brave the 4am wakeup to go see the auction, at least you wont have to travel too far to get there! I'm a big fan of the Peninsula chain in general, but the Tokyo branch takes the cake. Worth mentioning that the rooms don't have the best views of the city, but also not the worst. When we booked, we had breakfast included in our rate, and it was a pretty good breakfast with quite a few options (including Japanese breakfast). I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Tokyo.

It is within easy walking distance of the Ginza, Hibiya Park, the Imperial Palace and the Tsukiji Fish Market and within 2-3 min of various subway stops. I can highly recommend this hotel for a short or long stay in Tokyo.The rooms are terrific. We had a standard room and still it was incredibly luxurious with a lovely seating area with large flat screen tv, a king size bed with high-end linens and a well designed bathroom with bath and shower and a separate toilet area. You really could not ask for more in terms of the room. I can only imagine and dream of what the rooms with a great view over the park would be like! Similarly the staff were helpful and friendly and welcoming. My only issue concerns the breakfast. Of course like many top hotels in Tokyo breakfast is rather expensive but as they do not have a buffet option you can only order from menu. The quality was excellent but the portions were modest and so at the price I would say it did not meet my expectations. So I would say 5* for the hotel but 4* for the breakfast, mostly due to the portions.We did enjoy a drink on the top floor bar/restaurant and the view was spectacular. Be warned that smoking is permitted so for those now unaccustomed to smoke when indoors that is certainly not so appealing. We went early enough that it was not crowded and so it was not a big hassle but I would not want to go there at peak hours.","Toronto, Canada","ChemProf9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",50,5.0

This hotel is located on the edge of the Ginza a few blocks from the Imperial Gardens. The metro lines run in the basement if you don't feel like going outside, giving you access to the entire city. Then there is the hotel. Our room was on the 23rd floor with a view into Ginza and was fascinating day or night. The room was large, comfortable with a couch to watch TV from as well as an espresso machine and iron tea pot. The breakfast included with the room had items to suit people from around the world. The baked goods and pastries were better than some we've had in Paris and came from their own pastry shop (you can watch them make the things through windows on the hall). I can't say enough about the level of service, the cleanliness, the care in decoration of the public areas and the rooms. Just about everything in this hotel was perfect.

Unless you are planning to grow tomatoes, I'm not really sure that you need to be able to control the humidity (as well as the temperature of course) in your room but maybe I'm missing something. Similarly, the wind direction and speed are not data points we ordinarily need to consider when heading out of the room but perhaps, if you have a particularly large hat for example, this information might be of some use to you. To be fair, some of the buttons do add a certain something to your experience - the mood lighting in all the rooms and the 'Spa' setting in the bathroom being particularly memorable examples - but goodness knows what would happen if there ever was a power cut.Even without the superfluous buttons, the rooms would rank as among the nicest we have ever stayed in and if it was purely for the standard of accomodation, I would not hesitate giving the Peninsula 5 stars. It also scores highly for location, being on a prime spot within walking distance of some great neighbourhoods for eating and shopping, or simply for a relaxing stroll around the Imperial Palace. Oh and the Service is great too.So what lets it down albeit just a little bit? Well, we were a little bit disappointed by the public areas, with both the cramped lobby area (packing them in for Afternoon Tea) and rather under-whelming 'Peter' the bar at the top of the building higher on cost than then they were in either space or aesthetic appeal. It's almost as if all the focus was on the incredible rooms and the other bits were added on as something of an afterthought. We've stayed at The Peninsula in Hong Kong in the past and I get that the lobby is supposed to emulate it's illustrious big brother but somehow I don't think it works here. The bar was also underwhelming compared, say, to the chic space and eye-popping views at the Mandarin Oriental.In summary, I'm really glad we stayed here and experienced the incredible room but as a place to spend some time in (outside the comfort of your own four walls) we would personally think twice about returning. I've already mentioned the place that would probably edge it and it's a close call between what are probably the best hotels in Tokyo and amongst the very best in the world. In many ways the Peninsula is a decision for the head, while the Mandarin Oriental is one for the heart.","Biddenden, United Kingdom","Dr_John</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Biddenden, United Kingdom</strong>",250,4.0

The hotel is medium height (24 floors) with a neat area in fron with cloud pruned pine trees. The lobby area is a bit disappointing as it houses an all day restaurant (there are always people eating) and there is no where much to sit if you need to. Our rooms, however, were amazing with enormous bathrooms with a separate loo, lovely shower, a double ended bath, tv set in to the wall, two basins and so on. All marble and very well fitted. We also had a separate dressing room with dressing table and large hanging rails. In the bedroom the temperature controls were amazing with humidity control as well as heat and air con. Floor to ceiling blinds lower at the touch of a button. I could go on.Service in the hotel was top notch too. My only and very small complaint is that there is no easily accessible bar for meeting other members of the family, you had to go down in one lift and then up in another to the top floor. I imagine this is to deter the public from coming in and hanging around, but we really needed somewhere easy near the lobby to meet our friends before heading out.","London, United Kingdom","sriv60</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",46,5.0

Although I am no stranger to luxury hotels, I have never had a room like this one. It was more like a suite that included a living room, dining area, built-in desk and entertainment console. Best of all were the huge bathroom and walk-in closet/dressing room, both of which were incredibly spacious and luxurious. Not only did the closet/dressing room have tons of space for both suitcases and clothes, but it had a dressing table where you could do your hair and makeup. In the bathroom, the expected Toto toilet was the ultra-deluxe model that raises and lowers its lid as you enter the glass booth, flushes automatically and not only washes your nether regions but dries them with warm air. I loved the double sinks, fabulous bathtub (with a beautiful limestone wall behind it) and huge shower. The only trouble with the shower was that water leaked out the door a bit. My package came with breakfast, which turned out to be any breakfast I wanted--including the delicious 4,200 yen full Japanese or Western breakfast. Delicious! The staff was friendly, professional and capable of anything--including sending my suitcase to another hotel while I traveled around on the Shinkansen.My only complaint was the spa, which though luxurious was overpriced and offered the most useless shiatsu I've ever had at (by far) the most exorbitant price. While I enjoyed chatting in Japanese with the masseuse, she did not begin to get the knots out.

It was the first hotel during our trip and we were happy with our choice. It is a quality 5-star hotel in shopping and business district targeting mainly business travelers, the large room (with separate dressing) was very useful when carrying luggage for 3-weeks holiday. As traveller coming from Europe, do not expect however an unique unbelievable experience full of exotism (comparable with Shangri-la or Mandarin Oriental in Singapour, Hong Kong or Bangkok, for instance). The place is confortable, unbelievable clean, efficient service - we were somehow disappointed not to find too much ""Japanese soul"" inside.The breakfast is very basic - there are no real restaurants, just the one organised in the lobby. It is the standard for Tokyo center (hotels located in general-purpose towers, buildings are not designed as hotels, the only common spaces are the lobby, the floor with sauna, eventually the bar on the last floor etc.)The major part of the ground floor is rented to luxury ""international"" shops (not much interest - brands you never heard about, Italian-French-Swiss flavour quite expensive, nothing Japanese) - reminds me about Moscow.Surprisingly the lobby restaurant is always full - looks like it is a trendy place for business lunch during the week, and for rich family ""dejeuner"" on the weekend.Location is very convenient, direct acces (hotel underground) to Hibyia metro line and 2 min pleasant walk to Yarakucho JR station. Less than 1000 Yen (8€) by taxi to Tokyo station for Shinkansen, NEX trains etc. Plenty of restaurants around (direction to Ginza) however be careful the vaste majority close at 11pm and dont accept new customers after 10pm. Finding a place to eat becomes critical after 10pm, as restaurants are located inside the towers and dont display at street level the time of ""last order"" (or display in Japanese only, it is the same), means you will enter 10 buildings looking for a place to eat, it is disaster. There is a 24x7 fastfood close to hotel, we do not recommend.In conclusion, perfect base to start Tokyo discovery - no bad surprise and no stress (except issue with late dinner). Have to admit Tokyo is not a place for tourists looking for extravaganza and low-price shopping Asian-style, but for those eager to discover a sofisticated world comparable (if not superior) to Western Europe. You have to adapt to local rules, do not expect that everything is organised to satisfy your needs as a tourist.","Paris, France","George0404</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",44,4.0

This hotel has replaced the Ritz Carlton Tokyo (located in Midtown/Roppongi.....also an excellent hotel with equally good service and a great location) as my go-to hotel when I'm in Tokyo. We were traveling as a big family with two adults and our children (from 4 to 12). The coner suite with a connecting room was beyond our budget, so we opted for two Deluxe Rooms right next door to each other. Both rooms were 54 sq m / 579 sq ft and generous in size, contined a a large bathroom with double sinks, a nice deep bathtub and a eparately enclosed shower stall. The changing room/wardrobe, which was directly opposite the bathroom, was huge! I'd say it was almost the same size as the bathroom and could have easily fit a roll-in bed. In one room we had a King-sized bed, and in the other we had two twins. The bedrooms are well laid-out with a loveseat sofa and a small coffe table in front of the television, and a single chair placed perpendicular to the sofa. The sofa can be converted into a bed, which was what we had asked for each night when they turned down the room. There is also a separate dining/writing table by the window with two seats on either side. THe A/C, lighting, curtain controls, and humidity settings (yes, you can control the humidity of the room!!) are all easily controlled by the night table, and even a technology-averse guy like me was able to figure out the controls easily.As I was traveling with small children, and as I had great experiences with kids at previous Peninsula hotels in the past, I asked called down to see if they had anything for children. They asked for the kids' ages, and soon enough housekeeping was ringing the doorbell and handing over kids' sized bathrobes, slippers, coloring books, etc. In the afternoon (when we weren't out exploring nearby Ginza/Marunouchi/Hibiya) they called and asked if they could deliver the kids' treats. Housekeeping brought cookies, snacks, juice, and icing pens to let the little ones ""decorate"" their own cookies. At turndown there was even a small stuffed animal for each child. These little details not only made my little girls ecstatic but really impressed me as well.Because the hotel is so conveniently located, and we were with wanted to hit all our favorite restaurants in Tokyo, we didn't get a chance to try many of the restaurants in the hotel. The gym is small and lacks a good view of the exterior (it would have been great to run or bike with a view of the Imperial Palace) but the indoor pool is quite nice. I would suspect that the treadmills don't get used much since a run around the Palace would be so much nicer.The service was simply amazing. The Japanese just get it, even though tipping is not customary nor expected. The combination of the Japanese hospitality and service culture with the attention to detail of the Peninsula will impress the most difficult guests. One small detail that consistently impresses me is that after my run every morning, the door-woman (is this a word?) would seem to anticipate my arrival and have a fresh towel and bottle of water ready for me as she opened the front door to welcome me back to the hotel. I'm not sure how they do it.....maybe they have staff outside looking out for guests returning to the hotel from their morning run.If I had to point to one negative thing about this hotel it's the lack of public space. If one were planing to meet someone in the lobby, there's really nowhere to wait. There isn't a quiet corner that one could sit and read or people-watch. The tables of the lobby cafe stretch out almost to the front door and makes the entrance a bit crowded, and it would have been nice if the designers had allocated some open space and quiet seating areas. In summary, this understated but well designed hotel is a great choice for the business traveler or a family on a holiday.

While we were there the hotel opened their Chinese restaurant for a buffet breakfast (just for the cherry blossom week so this may account for service issues). The restaurant is pretty but breakfast selection was limited and we had to wait for our green tea to be delivered for 20-30 minutes every morning.

We chose it because of the strong reputation of Peninsula hotels, the high TripAdvisor ranking and generally positive reviews, and the location, which appeared to be the most congenial for our purposes.Although, on the whole, we were not disappointed, I'm afraid the Peninsula Tokyo did not quite match our (admittedly high) expectations. If I were to come to Tokyo again (and I rather hope I do, as it is a wonderful city), I will most probably stay elsewhere, despite the Peninsula's many positives.LocationThe Peninsula is, in my view, the best situated luxury hotel in Tokyo. It is located at the very top of of Yurakucho St, at the corner with Hibiya Park and the Imperial Palace Gardens. Essentially it sits right at the border between the Ginza shopping district and the Marumouchi district (a mixture of office buildings and high-end boutiques, this entire neighbourhood appears to have undergone a complete revitalisation recently and is really quite pleasantly elegant). You're a short taxi ride (the basic Y710 fare) from pretty much anywhere in Ginza (including the Tsukiji fish market) and Marumouchi (including Tokyo Station). Out of similarly located luxury hotels, the Shangri-La, Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, and Palace hotels are all located deeper in Marumouchi, nearer (if not adjacent to) Tokyo Station, whilst the Conrad is at the very bottom end of Ginza, with views of Tokyo bay. None therefore match the 'fulcrum' location of the Peninsula. Well, other than perhaps the enormous Imperial Palace, which is a couple of blocks away, but it's looking a bit like a communist conference hall now.Conveniently, there is a dedicated hotel entrance to the Hibiya metro station (which is on, I think, three different lines, the Chiyoda, the Hibiya and some other I can't quite remember), from where you can get pretty much everywhere. Which brings me to an important point. Given the ubiquity and all-round-awesomeness of the Tokyo Metro, as well as the ease with which one can find a taxi in Tokyo (albeit at a price, not dissimilar to certain European cities), I found that location is, in fact, less of an issue than I initially envisaged.Communal SpacesThe general décor of the public spaces is, of course, elegant and understated, though, if it were me choosing this type of things (and it's probably a good thing that it isn't), I would not have opted for the 'rust' colour scheme. However, and this is a big however, a big big however, the principal feature of the public spaces is that, well, there aren't really any. You come in and you get straight into the Lobby restaurant (so close is the restaurant to the door that, if you sit at one of the outer tables, you get a not entirely pleasant draft when the non-revolving doors are open). The Lobby restaurant is split in the middle by a short corridor with round banquettie-ish couches on either side of the corridor (as you can see from many of the user pictures). You walk through that and the (small) Reception is on you left. Once you've walked past that you're at the lifts, with another series of very small couches facing the lifts. And that's it. Other than the round couches which split the restaurants and the small couches facing the lifts, there is literally nowhere to sit (other than at a table in the Lobby restaurant). This, I think, is a serious issue. Not serious as in Second World War serious. Perhaps a bit less than that. But serious nonetheless. It really discourages mingling/loitering, something which a hotel reception should probably not do. I do realise that the restaurant-in-the-middle-of-the-lobby thing may well be a Peninsula trademark (following on from the Hong Kong original) but, partly because of the relative small size of the Tokyo lobby and partly because, well, it's a pretty daft idea, it really doesn't translate well here.Also, the rust colour scheme, coupled with the (admittedly very nice) wood panelling, which you can see in the picture, and the lack of natural light, makes the Lobby a rather dark place. Works rather well at night, with lovely soft lightnings, but it really isn't great during the day (particularly, I would imagine, on a hot summer day).All this boggles the mind a bit. They had an entire skyscraper to play around with from scratch and this is what they have come up with – a small, dark reception with nowhere to sit in. I may not be Norman Foster (or, who knows, maybe I am) but I really don't think that's good enough.RestaurantsLobby restaurant: as above, this basically IS the lobby. Ate there for breakfast everyday, a la carte. Breakfast was excellent (though, at Y3,800 a mini bank robbery; thankfully it was 'included' in the room rate).Peter restaurant/bar: on the 24th floor. Didn't eat there (well, other than some small bites at the bar, which were rather pleasant). Very stark décor. Probably not my cup of tea. The bar faces Ginza/Hibiya Park, whilst the restaurant proper faces the much nicer Imperial Palace Gardens. Chinese restaurant on the 2nd floor. Didn't eat there either, I'm afraid. As it was high season, it was open for breakfast (as a buffet) during our stay, to relieve the pressure off the Lobby restaurant. Tried to go once but there was a queue. As a matter of principle, I don't queue for buffets. There is no doubting I have very strange principles, but I find buffets bring out the worst in people and, if one can, one should avoid them. Certainly one should never queue for them.That's it, I think. Unless I missed something, which is most likely.RoomsAside from the quite unpleasant stench of smoke, on which I will elaborate further down (my, I seem to be writing a book here; and for what, a hotel. What a sad life I lead; though probably not as sad as yours if you're still reading), the rooms are top-notch.Very spacious, with living area (at least the category we had, may have been a 'deluxe' or whatever excuse they use to charge you more money). Also bright with floor to ceiling windows overlooking Ginza/Hibiya Park (I suspect those on high floors on the opposite side of the building have a better view facing the Imperial Palace Gardens). More technology than in the Starship Enterprise, including: panels from which you can electronically control everything from the room temperature, to the TV, to the curtains, to the lights; large flat screen TV; telephones everywhere; fax/printer/scanner; sockets in European/UK/US-Japanese format; top of the range Toto washlet (including the dryer function which is just awesome); and, I kid you not, a 'nail dryer'. No dedicated iPod dock but you can request a cable with which you can connect your mp3 player to the TV which works just fine. Also, free internet access (the only one out of the four hotels we stayed at in Japan that offered it). Again, I'm still in two minds about the ubiquitous rust colour scheme, particularly for the carpet, as, like the reception area, it seemed to make the room a bit stuffy, despite the very large windows, though, arguably, that is a matter of taste.ServiceGenerally, the service was impeccable, as you would expect when combining Peninsula and Japanese in the same service formula. In particular, with one minor exception (see below), the Concierge staff were absolutely brilliant in securing restaurant reservations including at hard-to-get places like Sukobayashi Jiro in Ginza and Quintessence in Minato (the former probably the most unpleasant – and per minute by far most expensive – dining experiences in my life and the latter one of the more pleasant).However, during the course of the five days a few glitches did come up.Firstly, there was almost inevitably a short queue at reception. Despite being the spoilt brat that I time, I did not mind this too much (understanding that this was a busy period), particularly as the reception staff would deal with this very professionally and open new 'positions' whenever additional staff was available. However, again, I couldn't help but think that a bigger reception counter (and area generally) would have been more suitable for a hotel of this size (and calibre).Secondly, I believe the room category I had booked was meant to have a 'Park View'. Knowing that the hotel was located opposite the Imperial Palace Gardens, I expected 'Park View' to mean view of the Imperial Palace Gardens. Instead, what I got was 70% view of Ginza and 30% view of Hibiya Park. Now, I suppose this still qualifies as 'Park View', yet I couldn't help but feel a little bit cheated. But then again, I feel cheated very easily.Thirdly, I had booked a non-smoking room. At check-in, they advised that, whilst the room was on a smoking floor, it was, in fact, a non-smoking room. Fine, I said (I'm try to limit the amounts of hissy-fits I throw these days; emphasis on 'try'). Of course, when I walked into the room, it reeked of smoke (thankfully, it was cigar smoke, which, strangely, I find less toxic). I called reception (still trying not to throw a hissy-fit) asking for a different room. They were all booked up they said. They could see if anything was available the following day. Not wanting to go through the 'hassle' of moving rooms after having already unpacked some stuff, I told them that I would keep they room but that they should try to air it a bit or spray one of those odour repellent things that probably make the smell worse rather than better. They did, I think, but the smell remained through the stay. Perhaps I should have moved room after all. Or perhaps they shouldn't have put me in a smoking room to begin with.Fourthly, I asked Concierge to book Shinkansen tickets to Kyoto for our check-out date. This they did very efficiently, or so I thought. The day before check-out, I get a call from Concierge asking that I see them urgently. Turns out they booked the ticket for that day rather than the day after. Apparently, the person that took the booking had misunderstood (never implying that I may have been the cause of the misunderstanding, which I sure hope I wasn't). Admittedly, they did send me a couple of confirmation messages to the room with the date, which I didn't bother to read properly, thinking that it couldn't really be messed up (so, I suppose, it was partly my fault after all). In any case, they apologised, re-booked the tickets and did not charge an extra penny. All dealt with very professionally. Yet, again, I was left thinking that this sort of thing should not have happened at all at a Peninsula. Or maybe I'm being too harsh. ConclusionAll in all, the Peninsula Tokyo is undoubtedly a very good hotel ideally located but, for one reason or another, our stay was not perfect. If I were to pick the main defects, it would certainly be the lack of reception space and the smell of smoke in the room. The three point rating should be seen in context. From a general perspective, this was certainly a five star hotel with five star service. However, when judged against the very high standards one has come to expect from this type of hotels (and the price tag that comes with it), then, I'm afraid, the Peninsula Tokyo comes a bit short.Having been for lunch, tea/coffee or dinner at a number of other Tokyo hotels during our stay at the Peninsula (including the Four Seasons near the train station, the Shangri-La, the Palace Hotel, the Grand Hyatt, the Ritz-Carlton, the Park Hyatt and the Conrad), and stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for one night a few days later, were I to come to Tokyo again, I would say that I would probably choose either the Palace Hotel, as it really is a beautiful property, brand new, full of light and with a lovely terrace, facing the Imperial Palace Gardens, or the Mandarin Oriental, whose location may not be ideal, but is an absolutely stunning hotel, with breath-taking views, plenty of space to mill around, a superb bar, and excellent restaurants. Alternatively, the Conrad, which has splendid views over Hamarikyu Park and Tokyo bay, though I believe the latter comes a slightly higher price tag than the Peninsula/Palace/Mandarin Oriental. The Shangri-La also seems very nice, though perhaps a bit flashy and is right next to the station. Four Seasons is very small and feels too business-focused (also adjacent to the station). Ritz-Carlton is in Roppongi, which, although a pleasant enough area, I would still prefer to be near Ginza/Marumouchi. The Park Hyatt, although iconic, is poorly located I think, next to the municipal administrative quarters near Shinjuku. Better to just go for drinks at the New York Bar (which really is lovely) and/or dinner at at the New York Grill (which, again, is very good) - you can walk through Shinjuku beforehand which is quite an experience.",London,"TheTub</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",194,3.0

The service of the bellmen, front desk staff, restaurant staff and Concierge service was outstanding. It was peak cherry blossom season and the hotel appeared to be a full capacity. For this reason the Concierge staff seemed a little overwhelmed assisting guests, but were very accommodating once you were able to speak with them. The deluxe suite was absolutely fantastic. It had wonderful views of the Imperial Palace and Hibiya Park and was incredibly spacious and outfitted with amazing electronic light controls and gadgets like other Peninsula properties we have enjoyed elsewhere. I was surprised that they did not have dedicated iPhone/iPod docks but that would be my only (very mild) complaint. We also stayed in a One bedroom suite at the Four Seasons Marunouchi at the start of our trip and the Peninsula Deluxe Suite wins hands down in terms of the room design, layout and views. Both properties are excellent, but if you want superior room design, views and layout, the Peninsula has a definite edge. Rooms that do not face the park, will not have the same ""wow"" factor as the Park view rooms or Deluxe Suites, but I am sure they are nicely appointed.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","SlickWilliam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",24,5.0

So, I'll keep it simple as possible. I stayed at the hotel during the recent IMF World Bank meeting when the hotel and the city were ""swarming"" with foreign guests. The following represents service excellence at its best:- Inbound flight delayed, meeting in 1 hour - the hotel GM met me upon arrival at the hotel entrance to ensure that I breezed through check-in formalities and somebody took care of the pressing of my suit.- Room - excellent, spacious and well appointed. The toilet seat is even heated! At no time did I return to my room that it's not made up yet. This is amazing considering the hotel is full. The view from my room was to the royal palace grounds. - Butler service - they're non-intrusive but always available when you need it.- Concierge - extremely helpful.- Check out and drive back to the airport - check out was very efficient (quick) and the drive almost uneventful. - Location - central to the everywhere.

Prior to our arrival, I had sent emails requesting perhaps 6-8 restaurant bookings - and by accounts, they weren't easy bookings to get and I had to juggle a schedule during our week stay. The emails were prompt and responsive and updates were given on which restaurants were booked and time slots available if they didn't fit my schedules. When I arrived, they printed out brochures, and I mean something concierge did themselves, with pictures of the restaurant, pin pointed on google map and directions. Plus, they had dress codes, phone numbers and opening hours as well as a summary page of my food adventure! Now that's service.

I was there for 4 days and I kept seeing the same staff, but none of them remembered me or my room number. The breakfast was passable, with a set menu or Japanese or Continental breakfast. The host arranging the seating for breakfast should be better trained. He didn't know how to manage customer expectations or optimum seating arrangements. I went to the gym everyday. It was in a gloomy space above the swimming pool with no natural light. Also, it was only about 50 sm total, which means they can't offer a very complete range of equipment.

Breakfast in The Lobby was also included. (An aside: the breakfast was fantastic but the menu was limited. However I could probably eat that French Toast almost everyday.) The lobby with its iconic bamboo sculpture and central light feature are spectacular. The rooms were spacious with separate dressing rooms and a well appointed bathroom suite. We enjoyed sweeping views from clerestory windows on the 20th floor. The location is perfect for seeing the city sites since you can walk to the Imperial Palace and enter the Hibiya subway station directly from the hotel.

The pillows were phenomenal, and this hotel provided us the best sleep we've ever had in Tokyo. Service is polite, but some things do get lost in translation as some staff still struggle with English conversation.

For example the in-your-face lobby lounge makes alighting from the limo and walking to reception an experience akin to a walk of shame in the school cafeteria. Equally, the thought of eating breakfast in the lobby lounge (the only on-property venue for breakfast) is an awkward one. I'm not sure many travelers want to be so 'on display' first thing of a morning? The reception desk is quite small and tucked up the back of the lobby lounge. While check-in is quick and painless it does feel a bit odd to be asked to take a seat in front of the elevator while a member of staff is summoned to escort you to your suite. These are all minor quirks that don't mean much in the grand scheme of things, but do translate to a disjointed first impression.The rooms have a slight polynesian-slash-modern-Japan feel. The ceiling in the bedroom is almost like a thatched bamboo weave and most of the fixtures including the sliding heavy door are solid wood. The natural tones are a welcome relief for the weary traveler but compared to other newer sister properties (i.e. the Peninsula Shanghai) it lacks the modern new world feeling. Our suite contained some of the usual thoughtful modern accents such as the housekeeping box (a box with a 2-way door in the dressing room with a light that tells you if something has been delivered, such as a newspaper, dry cleaning or shined shoes, but also has a button for the guest to summon the housekeeping staff to let them know you have something for them, such as laundry - all without having to interact with anyone). Nail dryer built-into the wall of the dressing room is another modern touch and likewise the mood lighting and entertainment system in the bathroom reminds you that this is a Peninsula. New accents such as a real espresso machine in the lounge room was a treat! While I love a Nespresso machine in my suite, having an old-school chrome espresso machine raring to go felt like true luxury. The bed is uber comfortable, even for an extremely fussy person like me. Each morning I awoke refreshed and rested, without any creaks in my back. The various pieces of furniture in the room mean that doing some work at the desk, sipping espresso with views over the Imperial Palace or lounging in front of the TV were all comfortable affairs and the luxury of having plenty of space to do all of that translated into a very relaxing stay indeed.As one would expect from a Peninsula in Japan, the level of service can be over-the-top. Some like that, some don't but I doubt that many could fault it. Room service offerings were thorough, the menu reads like a compendium of gourmet, so much so that I felt comfortable making up my own order without referring to the menu and simply ordering things I wanted. The resulting food and beverages arrived without fuss and again with thoughtful accents such as silverware and bone china and hand-made origami creations. Champagne was served with several complimentary accompaniments and given I was entertaining guests in the suite the staff even offered to stay and wait on us.The location is one of the truly magnificent aspects of this property, located right on the edge of Marunouchi with every imaginable boutique at your doorstep, but also just across from the Imperial Palace. WIth almost every Tokyo train and subway line right in front (or under) the building, getting around is a cinch.I loved this property, albeit not on par with the luxe of the Peninsula Shanghai, the service does exceed that of its sister. The location, the food offerings, the sumptuousness of the bed and the views make this a clear winner for accommodation in Tokyo.

Before I even sat down they had come over with water, goggles, swimcap and laid out towels :-) Staff at reception were also so helpful, even going as far as to escort us to the metro (which is directly underneath the hotel and accessible via the lift in the lobby)!The positives are endless but this review is already long enough. Only slight negatives are the breakfast which is very expensive for what you got and unflexible. We were not allowed to change anything from the set menus even of they were worth less.Peter bar has lovely decor but for a hotel of this calibre the drinks selection was not great and the bar staff were not that knowledgable (however this may have been due to a language barrier).Overall, if you are thinking of staying then based on our experience; just book it!",London,"HungryTraveller25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",41,5.0

Also a lot bigger than we thought it would be. The dressing room was ideal because it meant we kept the cases out of view allowing the lounge/bedroom to be tidy.Went to the bar the first night. We ordered a selection of bar food thinking that they would be small tasters. What a mistake. They were full size, hillarious !The wine in the bar is eye wateringly expensive. I'd expect to pay a premium but £18 a glass was more than I expected.

The hotel was wonderful and the staff impeccable. DH & I joked that the housekeeping staff were ninjas, since we never saw or heard them. They were excellent at learning our schedule and handling the room while we were out. Not only do they do the daily cleaning of the room, they also return in the evenings for turn down service that includes putting out you slippers and providing complementary bottle water. It was a very nice touch. We had a Deluxe King Corner Room on the 18th floor. We had a wonderful view of the Imperial Palace and looking at Ginza. Amazing!! The rooms include yukata to sleep in, bathrobes, slippers, shampoo, conditioner, soap, shower gel, bath salts, shower cap, comb, brush, vanity kit, sewing kit, toothbrush & toothpaste, lotion, etc... Unless you require special bathroom amenities, feel free to leave your stuff at home. That will save room in you luggage for things you're going to purchase while on holiday. LOLOur room accommodations including daily breakfast. For breakfasts you have 2 options to eat either in The Lobby restaurant or the buffet breakfast. We always opted for the buffet breakfast since it had so many options. At the buffet there were fresh pastries (muffins, croissants, danishes, etc...), scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, miso soup, fried rice, noodles, french toast, fresh fruit and many other options. And the juices were amazing! So tasty.We ate a few times at the hotel. Peter restaurant up on the 24th floor had amazing food and the views were spectacular. The Lobby restaurant was fun and quirky as it was in the lobby of the hotel. It was fun to eat and see people coming and going. And the food was great too. We only ate breakfast at the Chinese restaurant on the 2nd floor and did not eat at the basement Japanese restaurant (sushi & tempura dishes). Room service was wonderful too.If your budget is accommodating, I highly recommend going to the concierge and have them make you a reservation for Kawamura. It is a kobe beef teppan restaurant. Amazing food. They are open for lunch and dinner, with lunch being the less expensive option. Getting around town was very easy. You can walk around to all sorts of shops. Just exploring our surroundings we found amazing eateries. We don't speak any Japanese and neither did some of the restaurant staff, but it wasn't a problem at all. They all have either food models or pictures of the food, so we just pointed and indicated how many of which item. Super simple, so if you don't speak Japanese do not worry.There are 7-Eleven, Lawson and other convenience stores all over. Besides being able to get on the metro Hibiya line in the hotel basement, it is quick and easy to walk to any other metro or JR (railway) line and head all over Tokyo. Be sure to get your SUICA card at the station from the payment machines. You can add more money to it as you need to. Just FYI.There is so much do to and see in Tokyo and The Peninsula Tokyo is a great hub. It was always fun to ""come home"" after a fun day of walking around. We look forward to coming here again and trying other Peninsula hotels around the globe.","Ventura, California","Tamika N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ventura, California</strong>",2,5.0

When we arrived they charged an extra 5000 yen a night on top for another (very comfortable) bed. Breakfast was only for 2 so we had to pay for an extra child.

The service, as one could imagine, was impeccable. Everyone greeted you when they saw you, of course that seems also to be the Japanese custom. Our room was gorgeous, very modern, high tech and functional, overlooking the imperial palace gardens. They seemed to think about everything when they designed the room from our own personal kimonos, robes, slippers, a drawer full of toiletry supplies, a well stocked coffee/tea bar etc. The bathroom was also beautiful with the most high-tech toilet I have ever used, including a heated seat. The tub was large with a cascading water spout, and a personal tv to watch while bathing. The fitness area is also nice with several treadmills, bikes, ellipticals, (all with personal tvs), a large variety of weight machines as well as free weights. The gym gets quite busy early in the morning, as is expected. The spa looked gorgeous, albeit quite pricey.The dining area in the lobby where we had a daily breakfast was good. A selection of freshly baked in-house pastries, fresh fruit juices, choice of coffees as well as many breakfast items were offered. The service was wonderful and friendly.The concierge service was also exceptional. I used their help many times and they went out of their way to help me meet my needs. My only complaint would be that the turndown service was on the late side, about 8:00 pm. With our jetlag and busy days, we were often thinking about turning in by the time they arrived. They were always friendly and efficient when they came, and scurried about making sure they covered all their bases. A nice touch to the maid service was a piece of fruit left for us almost everyday. The asian pears were delicious!The hotel is very well situated and convenient to many areas. The trains are very close, and one line is even accessible through the basement of the hotel.

To give context for this review, I have stayed at the following hotels in Tokyo to date: Park Hyatt (Lost in Translation hotel), Grand Hyatt Roppongi Hills, ANA Intercontinental, Ritz Carlton and the Conrad. As a business traveller I would give thus hotel a 9; as a honeymooner I would give it a 6.5 out of 10.I stayed at this hotel in September 2012 for business and was impressed by the size of the room, the layout, the lovely bathroom (with Japanese bath) and the dressing room. The hotel is clean, extremely modern and very central so easy to get to meetings in the business district, Tokyo station, Ginza, Tsukiji (fish market) and a short taxi ride to Roppongi. For those who like to exercise, the gym is comfortable, the pool very nice and more importantly you are next door to the Imperial Palace which makes for a great 30 minute running circuit. Also a bug positive is that taxis are always on standby (but then this is the case at most hotels). I can only comment on food, which was very good, in relation to the Japanese breakfasts I had.My new husband and I subsequently stayed here for our honeymoon in December 2012. I had considered the Park Hyatt but as we were only in Tokyo for 3 nights and had a lot to see, we decided it was more important to stay central as the Park Hyatt is in Shinjuku and slightly further away. We arrived at the hotel at 6.00am and were rightly told that our room would not be ready until midday. It was our own doing to arrive so early and so we were told that the only way to get a room was to pay an extra 25,000¥ for the only room available. It would have been nice to have been upgraded to this room but I appreciate that they can not do this for all guests who arrive before check-in, even if on honeymoon. Not wishing to wait for 6 hours we paid up. However, over our three day stay there was ZERO acknowledgment that we were on honeymoon which I think was poor form, particularly if you consider that the Japanese are renowned for their service and hospitality. We didn't expect much but a free drink or another acknowledgement would have been appreciated. I see a follower reviewer had a similar experience when there was no acknowledgement of his friend's birthday. When staying in a 5-star hotel charging rates north of £500 per night, small gestures are easy to organise and can have a very positive impact on guests. The food during this stay was very good (me having a great Japanese breakfast again and my husband having an omelette) although when my husband tried to order hash brown on top of his fried eggs, which were much cheaper price than the 3,800¥ set menu that was included in our rate, he was told we would be charged an extra 700¥ which again was their policy but showed their general inflexibility. The only slight negatives of the Peninsula more generally are that the restaurant is next to the lobby on the ground floor and the views from the rooms tends to overlook the road because of the hotel's location. The reason that having the restaurant next to the lobby is negative is that it is less private and unlike most other 5-star hotels in Japan, which are situated on the very high floors above offices, there is no view. The bar is on slightly higher floors but the views don't quite compare.In summary, in spite of being very satisfied with my experience when there for business, I would be inclined to stay at another hotel on my next business trip in a few months time only because I felt that the hotel was less attentive on the last trip and it would have incurred minimal effort on their part to change this.",London,"TheAwesomeFoursome</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",14,3.0

Location was great: very close to the imperial gardens, Ginza shopping district, tokyo station, fish market, etc. We had dinner one night at Peter. The food was very good, but not my favorite meal in Tokyo, perhaps because it didn't seem to make sense to have an indulgent French meal when traveling as far as Japan. While the meal was pricey, the serving sizes were unexpectedly large. My husband and I agreed that we would not have ordered a first course had we known how large the entrees were. We returned to Peter a few times for drinks at the bar. The bar and restaurant offers excellent views of the city and is a great place for a night cap. We used the fitness center and pool facilities.

We had left our luggage bags at Peninsula and when we returned from Hakone to re-check in, we were pleasantly surprised to learn our bags were already in our new room. This is great initiative. - Hubby and I are food lovers and the concierge desk had really good suggestions on where we could fulfill our yakitori, okonomiyaki, unagi, sushi, ramen cravings. These suggestions were also convenient to get to. They did not push for dining within the hotel, which is something we experience in hotels in other countries. - The complimentary Rolls Royce ride (when car is available and for 2km radius) is a great service - pampers the soul and helps the wallet (cab rides in Tokyo can be hefty if you are used to New York, Shanghai, Singapore, etc prices). What shone for us was how the driver went out of his way to ensure (1) we stayed dry when we were alighting in wet weather and (2) show us the way amidst a busy Tsukiji market to a sushi chain that he had suggested in response to our one innocent question on where we could find good sushi in the market. - I was having a cold and requested for hot water. On both occasions (as we checked in twice), a hot thermos (re-boilable) flask and kettle were brought to the room within five minutes of request. I also requested for support pillows (tempur shaped), which they had and it was great for my blocked nose.- Other reviewers have also mentioned the bottled Fiji water, gym shoes, swim cap and goggles that they discreetly offer for your workout. These are really thoughtful, but I further love the ""wet swimsuit dryer"", ""spare plastic bag"", ""comb"" and ""mouthwash"" in the ladies locker room. So much thought put into considering the guests' needs, both before and after. - Coffee was great. They had the Lavazza coffee capsules, which in my opinion, taste far better than the nespresso ones. We did prefer the creme & aroma flavor than the other type which we thought tasted a bit sour. Having said that, both had strong body and did its job of perking us up in the morning.- VOIP phone: we love this feature of Internet telephony because it helps to save international call charges. The Peninsula in Shanghai offers free VOIP calls, which is fantastic. The Tokyo VOIP service comes with local call charges for international VOIP calls. Was very reasonable: just about JPY249 for a short call. Wasn't timing the clock as I was speaking to my dearest two year old back in Singapore. It probably was for around 5-10 min since she can't yet carry a good conversation!- the remote control panels on both sides of the bed (Yes, hubby and I like to lounge and laze!). Would be even greater if the blinds had remote control too :)- love the TV remote control.

The swimming pool is fantastic and the people who work in the spa are so kind and helpful one can relax and feel completely taken care of. The lobby takes some getting used to with its zen simplicity, but it grows on you and works. The breakfasts is great, the coffee latte yummy, and the breads wow. Some of the luxury hotels in Tokyo have a heavy feeling to them. The Peninusla feels like and fresh. We liked it so much we enjoyed staying in our rooms even though all of Tokyo beckoned. When we did leave the location a few blocks from Ginza was ideal. We cant wait to find anotehr reason to return to the Peninusla Tokyo.","San Francisco, California","yarrl C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",16,5.0

The coordination from Front Desk to concierge, to the bell boys, and even to the gym, was all incredibly smooth. For instance, on our departure, we had a midnight flight out and they kindly allowed us to use the gym facilities to freshen up before our flight after an afternoon in the hot sun. When we got to the gym in the evening, they were already expecting us, and when we got downstairs the concierge had our bags ready and a taxi waiting. All the concierges were fantastic, seamlessly booking all our restaurant reservations and on short notice getting us into 2 restaurants that usually need 1-2 months of advanced booking. Also love the detailed maps they provide for each booking. The location, in our opinion, is better than the other top hotels in the Ginza and Marunouchi area, right beside the Palace and right in the middle of Ginza, between many of the best restaurants in Tokyo and some of the best shopping. Right in front of the hotel, there is a beautiful and popular 5km jogging route around the Imperial Palace, past cherry trees and moats, and there is a map in your room of the route.The Deluxe room has a great layout, with a large walk-in closet that gets a lot of use (to drop off the shopping, try on the new stuff, etc), and a large bathroom with his & her sinks. The main room has a comfortable and usable living room area with a sofa, and cool tech like automatic curtains, espresso machine, free and fast wifi, etc. The rooms with the park view have a lovely view of the excellent imperial palace. A few other random things we love about the Peninsula Tokyo: the complimentary Rolls Royce car service (seriously, how do you top this), the gym has running shoes if you forgot yours, the pool has swimming goggles which no one ever travels with, and everything is offered to you so discretely, and quite perfectly.","Singapore, Singapore","HungryBoar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",2,5.0

Nothing is forgotten and the design is exceptional. I didn’t eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel and the bar was closed for a private function, which I found extremely annoying (???). I did have room service and it was very average and approaching inedible…I was hungry and it was late. Now for the really bad, the staff at the hotel were lazy, unhelpful, poorly trained and worst of all argumentative?? Particularly the front desk and the concierge. It was just extremely annoying how hopeless they were. A true contrast with the Park Hyatt where I had stayed a few days earlier.

If you can afford this, quite frankly you are in for one of the best hotel experiences anywhere in Asia. The rooms are plush, elegant, functional and extremely comfortable.The views of the Imperial Palace are stunning, especially at daybreak or sunset. The staff have two fabulous characteristics - one, they work for the Peninsula so are trained to extremely high standards. Two, they are predominantly Japanese, so you are getting some of the highest quality 'aim to please' staff on the planet.The location is great, next to the shopping and offices of Maranouchi and Ginza and both Hibiya Park and the Imperial Park. Quite frankly, every aspiring hotel chain should send its staff to this hotel - it would teach everyone a thing about excellent, discrete and incredibly polite service in a tremendous property. A colleague of mine swears by the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo (about 1km away). I have not stayed there because although the MO may rival the Peninsula, I just doubt anything could actually beat the outstanding experience I consistently get at this truly luxury hotel.

All they will have to do is a small cut in the wallpaper, and they are almost ready to transfer guests directly from airport to the hotel! Wow!The concierge is really efficient and knowledgeable, providing you with any information you will need regarding the surroundings, the restaurants and bars, what to do, and so on.During our stay we experienced a major earthquake, above 5 on Richter scale. Everything was shaking, cracking... frightening experience, but the building is still in place, with no cracks anywhere. It has been designed on purpose, with a big empty area in the middle.

For my taste, I found that there was too much furniture in the rooms- (I had a suite room) and the asthetics of the decor is not pleasing, generally-speaking. Peter Restaurant has nice city views- but is also not worth the price. Service was very slow. I would have a drink in Peter Bar (which is cheerfully decorated) and enjoy some bar food, then go out somewhere fun for dinner, such as to a local sushi bar in Tsukiji, or Two Rooms (Restaurant) in Aoyama if you'd like to enjoy Western-style (continental) fare. The spa is shockingly tiny and cramped, the gym not worth the effort. Massage treatments were average for a Peninsula Hotel (Los Angeles Penainsula is SO MUCH BETTER) and the treatments are way too expensive- even for Tokyo. I would go for an outside massage service such as Alyssa: http:massagebyalyssa.wordpress.com/ Her massage is less expensive, plus she will come to your room- allowing you to relax and fall asleep when your session is over. The bottom line is that in a city like Tokyo, the Peninsula Tokyo cannot compare to Grand Dame Hotels such as The Imperial Hotel or The Okura. Although both of those hotels have seen better days, they have excellent staff who pay atttention to every detail. I would say the only (newer ) 5-Star hotel which comes close to the service I require is the Mandarin Oriental. Lovely rooms, well-trained staff, fabulous bar with live entertainment, but the restuarants and spa are also very over-priced-- even for Tokyo.That's my two cents!","New York City, New York","bloggy99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",20,3.0

Instead we ate at one of the excellent little hole-in-the-wall eateries in ""Corridor Street"" alongside the Shinkansen tracks nearby . Locals only (but there's an English menu), great food and very reasonable indeed. (Go down Harumi Dori street alongside the hotel, then under the railway bridge, turn right at Game! store). Also, there are loads of little restaurants in the basements of office buildings behind the hotel towards Yurakucho station. Japanese food, and also Japanese versions of Italian and Spanish food.

Think of them as tiny spots on a million-dollar gemstone, please...* I am a big gadget fan and I still believe this room went overboard on the control panels, having more than 20 that I could count. Some consolidation via touchscreens [akin to Las Vegas CityCenter] would help.* Not sure why there was no numerical temperature setting, just a few levels of warm & cold.* The lobby area lacks a private feel. Walking out the front of the hotel feels like walking straight through a busy restaurant. I think some more dividers could help.* The pool/spa hours for families [9-6pm I was told] are not ideal. I would prefer a mixed weekly schedule so we could at least have 1 evening to swim without disrupting our sightseeing.* Elevators and some common areas were freezing cold!* Breakfast is exorbitantly expensive [at least 4000 yen a person].

The building and the facilities (especially the stunning pool) are beautiful. The service was very good, but we found it a bit less warm and gracious than the Four Seasons (we also stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel Tokyo at Marunouchi on this trip). The check-in staff are very good at their jobs: they upsold us on a room upgrade and we checked in to a lovely suite with a terrific view of Ginza and the Shinkansen tracks leading south of Tokyo. The suite had a guest bathroom, a large living room with a wall of windows, a dressing area and large bathroom and a serene, comfortable bedroom. We were fascinated by the technological aspects of the room (the coffee service, the lighting, the heating and cooling, the only-in-Japan electronic toilets) and really enjoyed trying to figure out how everything worked. The Peninsula is in a terrific location - within walking distance of a park, the Imperial Palace and gardens and lots of high-end shopping. It's a great base for exploring Tokyo and even though we had been to Tokyo before, we discovered new things on this visit and found that we appreciated Tokyo all the more. A highlight of our stay was the complimentary (with a suite) three-hour use of a chauffeur-driven Mini Cooper Clubman to take you anywhere you want to go (within a fixed radius from the hotel). Thanks to our lovely driver (who helped us map out an itinerary), we visited a museum and a park and drove around the exterior of the Imperial Gardens. We had one dinner at Peter, the oh-so-trendy restaurant on the top floor of the hotel. While the view was amazing and the service very good, the food was a bit too modish and the overall scene a bit too much for a relaxing, enjoyable meal - it felt like a nightclub/restaurant rather than a top-flight restaurant. We also had one dinner in the ground floor restaurant that takes up two sides of the entrance lobby (with a walkway in the middle). The food and service were just okay, and the placement of the restaurant in the lobby (on the way to the front desk) makes it feel a bit like you're eating in a hallway. The pool and spa is in a large two-story space with floor-to-ceiling windows that face the Imperial Gardens. The pool is large and there are plenty of chairs for seating and relaxing. The separate steam room is up a spiral staircase and down a quiet hallway. We greatly enjoyed our visit to the Peninsula Tokyo and look forward to seeing what else Peninsula has to offer in other cities - we already have reservations at the Peninsula Beverly Hills for an upcoming trip to Los Angeles. We highly recommend the Peninsula Tokyo - it's a terrific hotel.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","MJPBAF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",301,5.0

Our overall Tokyo experience far exceeded our expectations, in part due to our stay at this world renowned hotel. This is a first class establishment in every way from the gentleman who gave us a thorough tour of our room upon check in, to the staff on hand at the pool, to the servers at breakfast and finally to the desk staff who bid us good morning and sweet dreams each day~ all in perfect English. We had a hard time leaving our room each day it was so luxurious yet cozy. The bed and bedding was ultra comfortable and there was no need to leave thanks to the bedside controls to everything in the room! Immediately after checking in we found child sized slippers and a robe along with children's bath products for our daughter. All of the special details in the rooms have been mentioned in previous reviews. The closet/dressing area, the in room coffee/tea service, the toilet gadgetry and the daily paper in our private delivery box were some of our favorite things. There is a blow dryer in the room and the bath products were wonderful. The drawer was stocked with extra toiletries (razor, hair brush, comb, tooth brushes, etc). We did have to ask for an iron but they brought it right away and left it in our room all week which we appreciated.The location is ideal, right across from Yurachuko station with plenty of great restaurants within a few minutes walk. We walked to the fish market every morning (15 minute walk) and strolled through Hibiya park right across the street. The main shops are just a few blocks away (5-10 minute walk) which was perfect for us. Breakfast was included for us and it was a treat! Many reviewers mention the lobby restaurant being front and center as strange but we didn't find it unusual at all. This was one of our best vacations yet and certainly the most memorable hotel experience to date. We couldn't find one single flaw with anything here. The elevators were always quick up to/from our 19th floor room, our room was cleaned quickly and was spotless each day and every encounter with a hotel employee was above and beyond top notch service.","Houston, Texas","TLWhite</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",123,5.0

However, prices were not cheap at all.... finally May 2012, we got a decent price with cheap air tickets, hence we stayed 3 nights at the Pen Tokyo. Everything was wonderful. Check in was fast, non smoking room requested. They had our room ready, and key was ready, and even offered us late check out if we needed. We didn't because our flight was in the middle of the afternoon. Check out is at noon.The rooms are as beautiful and well maintained as before. Quiet, clean, spacious, and the only thing I noticed was they took away the mobile phone unit that they used to have in the room for guests to take out of the hotel while sightseeing around Tokyo. Now they don't have it anymore. The only thing I didn't like was the amenities. The body gel , shampoo and conditioner didn't feel luxurious at all. Very blah. What impressed me the most was their concierge. Thank you so much again to Sanae, and Satoru, for ALL your help. Prior to our arrival, I had requested the concierge to make restaurant reservations at the top Michelin star restaurants, and some of our favorites. Many of them were already fully booked, and many changes had to be made, and I had many questions. But each email I sent out, the concierge would reply promptly, with all the answers, and always in such courteous manner and helpful manner. Without their help, our visit to Tokyo would not be the same this time.My husband and I also had a parcel delivered to the hotel, but they didn't even bother us at all, when it arrived, they just delivered it straight to our room and in the wardrobe. Airport limousine bus drops you right in front, and on the way back to Narita, picks you right in the front, and so many staff to help you with your departure.The location is unbeatable.

A great deal of thought has obviously gone into the location and design of the hotel. We booked through American Express' Fine Hotels & Resorts Program, which includes early arrival when possible (didn't need it), guaranteed late check-out (used it), complimentary breakfast (very nice) and upgrades when available (rec'd upgrade to cormer deluxe from deluxe room). Our room, which combined with the bathroom and dressing areas was huge, had a partial view of the Imperial Palace. The bed, as we came to realize as we stayed at other hotels in Japan, were truly comfortable. The room decor, while not cutting-edge in design per se, was very current and soothing, which after each day pounding the Tokyo pavement was much appreciated. All of the usual hoo-hah is there: dual sinks, TOTO accessories, daily newspaper of your choice, WiFi in the room. The spa/fitness area was especially nice, with a lovely steam/sauna area, accompanied by showers with interesting functions beyond the normal waterfall showerhead. The indoor pool area was also very relaxing, and they had goggles, caps -- even suits -- should you need them. For real swimmers, the pool wasn't too warm (approx. 80-82) and there was one designated lap lane; it was roughly 20 yards long. Again, after a long day of sightseeing, it was great to come back and enjoy the respite by the pool and hot tub. What perhaps didn't quite measure-up, was the entry into the hotel, which forces you to walk through the restaurant on the lobby level, split by an open area that you traverse to get to the reception area. Concierge services and the bellman are located on the entrance side of this this area, but to get to reception you have to traipse through that area. We weren't sure what was up with that design decision. However, the subway line was accessible underneath the hotel, which was definitely a plus, and there are shopping and restaurant choices galore in the Ginza District, which is relatively low-key compared to some of the more active areas of Tokyo. Overall, we very much enjoyed our stay and feel that it enhanced our Tokyo experience by allowing us to refresh in relative peace and quiet within the megapolis that is Tokyo. We are becoming fans of The Peninsula when traveling to cities that have one (e.g., really liked the Bangkok facility as well).

The hotel is nicely located across from the Imperial Palace and a very short walk to Ginza. The hotel has an underground connection to the Hibiya station which was convenient.The room was very large and consisted of a nice seating area and a large dressing room that was completely separate from the bathroom. The dressing room had plenty of hanging space as well as space for luggage. The bathroom was nice with separate wash basins and a large soaking tub in the middle. One of the nice things about the room was that the bathroom and dressing room areas could be completely closed off from the rest of the room via a large wooden sliding door, so there was minimal disruption if someone is an early riser. The room also featured an espresso machine.We had a nice view of Ginza from our 22nd floor room, but not all rooms have decent views. And you probably shouldn't expect to face the Imperial Palace unless you're staying in a suite. I'm not 100% certain on that, but pretty sure. Some rooms will just have views of the side of the buildings across the street; we were just fortunate.Normally I'm not a big fan of the automation that hotels put in their rooms (you know the lighting controls, etc). I find them to typically be clunky and non-intuitive and more of a nuisance than anything. However, the Peninsula far exceeds any expectations in this arena - they know how to do it right. There were control panels everywhere in the room controlling everything from lighting to temperature and humidity to the curtains and shades. There was even a panel by the desk that would tell you the current outside temperature as well as windspeed and direction. You never had to look around to find a control panel as everywhere you would want one there would be one, and every one worked brilliantly - this is the kind of automation I would put in my home. There was even a button labeled ""Spa"" next to the tub which would dim the lights and begin playing relaxing spa-like music in the bathroom. I've included a couple of pictures of the various types of control panels.We had breakfast every morning in the Lobby Restaurant as it was included in our room rate. The breakfast food was decent, but nothing spectacular with limited selection as part of the rate. We also ate dinner a couple of nights in the same restaurant and the experience was much nicer. The food was memorably delicious, and the ambiance was enhanced with the live music being performed in the 2nd floor balcony which was clearly designed for this purpose. The only really negative thing I would have to say about the Lobby Restaurant is that it's a bit awkward as the main path from the front doors to reception/elevators goes right through the middle of the restaurant. It makes it a little odd with people continually walking back and forth and meeting up with folks near where you're dining. Having been in the Peninsula Hong Kong, I ""get"" what they were trying to accomplish with the Lobby Restaurant in Tokyo - it was just oddly executed, presumably due to limited space with the floor plan of the building.We had drinks one night in the Peter bar on the 24th floor, and the views were very nice.One of the things I found most interesting about this hotel was how they chose to utilize the dead space in the center of the building where no rooms or utilities would exist. They created a work of art called The Void which extends from the 8th floor up to the 23rd floor. It's a completely black space that is filled with 24 tornado-like pieces that are suspended in the vast space. Each is illuminated by strings of lights that are wrapped around them. The elevator lobby on our floor (and presumably all of them) had 3 windows that looked out in to this space, and it was very interesting. It doesn't photograph very well due to the lighting levels, but I'm sure there are pictures online of it.Overall, the stay at The Peninsula was wonderful, with one of our favorite (if not most favorite) rooms of any hotel we've stayed in.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","HauntedMansion</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Worth, Texas, USA</strong>",15,5.0

I travel in Asia extensively, and have always enjoyed the hospitality of Japan; my experience at the Peninsula in Tokyo exceeded my already high expectations.My room had a large bathroom with two sinks, a separate changing room/walk-in closet and a large bedroom with a sitting area. Unfortunately the work-area for my computer was a bit cramped, but was acceptable. Water pressure was good and the bed comfortable with drapes that kept out the sunlight.The gym was nice and had good machines and the pool (although only 20-meters) was very nice and I was able to swim laps without problems.Morning breakfast either in the lobby or the basement was good, although a bit more limited than usual for a top-end Japanese hotel.The staff was wonderful and almost all had very good English-language skills.Overall...this was an excellent hotel, in a great location (steps/elevator for the hotel goes to the Hibyia station underneath the hotel). My only quibbles would be a rather limited restaurant selection in the hotel (although plenty of restaurants abound just steps away), and a rather limted work-space.FYI....for those who are Catholic, the Franciscian Chapel has English-language masses on Sundays, and holy days (and maybe even daily mass?), which is near the Ropping Crossing station, which is only 3-4 stops on the Hiybia line from the hotel- check out the chapel's website for detailed directions (worth prining-out the first time you visit).",Evanston,"Evanston_Jeff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Evanston</strong>",12,5.0

The left hand doesnt know what the right is doing.Wrong meals delivered by room service, took 40 minutes to get our breakfast in the restaurant, poor service, approached by staff about matters that had nothing to do with us..... we cut short our reservation and moved to the MO as quick as we could.Let me just say that I have stayed in many hotels in Tokyo and all over Japan, and I can advise that this is by far the most over rated and over priced. Both the Mandarin Oriental and Conrad are streets ahead. Regarding breakfast, there is no buffet, which is fine, however if you are on a bed and breakfast plan, you breakfast bill is limited to 3800Y ($45) which is also fine, until you realize that the (very bad) cup of cafe latte costs 1200Y !!! $15 for a cup of coffee at breakfast. ha. add a smoked salmon bagel to that at $30 and you have hit your limit. Fancy an orange juice, or anything else ? well, now you have got to pay (alot), for a breakfast that was supposed to be included in your package.Further, when you are in a bustling city like Tokyo, you are looking for your hotel to be a refuge, an island of calm. The Peninsula is not this. You enter through the main restaurant, which is almost as noisy as the streets outside.Having stayed at other top hotels in Tokyo, I know there is much better out there, and I will not stand for this nonsense.

The rooms are so gorgeous you almost didn't want to leave. Bathrooms were lovely, dressing area was a very nice touch, room was comfortable and extremely inviting. Being in the room was a pleasure. My only reservation is that this was obviously a touristy hotel, which is not a bad thing in and of itself, but I suppose it depends on what you would like to experience. The staff in the hotel were so used to speaking to people in English that when we used what little Japanese we knew you could see the surprise on their faces. When we asked for recommendations on where to go to eat we were directed towards Western cuisine restaurants. When we asked how to get somewhere the first question was if we were going to take a taxi. This a luxurious hotel that serves luxurious people, but if you are like me and actually would like to get down and dirty in the place you are visiting (keeping in mind how difficult it would be to get truly dirty in Tokyo) then this may not give you what you are looking for. Also, Ginza area seemed pretty quiet after the shops closed, but I may not have been looking in the right places.

The Peninsula Tokyo has much much much larger rooms.2. The service is faultless at all three hotels.3. The Peninsula Tokyo is more service by numbers, lots and lots of door staff, receptionist and management in ther lobby. The Manadarin Oriental Tokyo is more subtle. The Park Hyatt is more discreet.4.

(couple with toddler) Like other reviewers, this is our favourite hotel, despite the hefty price tag.Our Top 10 list:10. Master consoles on BOTH sides of the bed. The buttons switch off completely without that irritating green electronic glow, but if you need to check the time or adjust the aircon, just nudge it/brush any button, and the buttons are illuminated. 9. It seems silly at first, but the valet box service is a great idea, allowing you to fetch your morning paper without having to open the room door in your bathrobe or pajamas. 8. Great bathtub worthy of any spa. Well-placed controls within reach of the tub.7. Great shower, with both the rain shower and hand-held options, allowing you to use both at the same time. Can't believe other 6-star hotels don't do the same. 6. Coffee machine in the room. A nice touch. 5. Great gym/pool. If you didn’t bring your gear, they will loan you workout gear in perfect condition. 4. For a business hotel, it's surprisingly good for families with kids. We arrived to find a room equiped with child-sized bathrobe, peninsula bear logo'd slippers, bath toys (starfish and bear sponge), child-safe toiletries including a cute toothbrush kit, and a plate with little Japanese biscuits set out on the low coffee table. 3. Generous room sizes meant that instead of traipsing around town all day/night, we were quite happy to enjoy our retreat. We even ate-in and bought bento boxes from Mitsukoshi's famed food hall to enjoy our 22nd floor view. And if either parent needs to make a business call, the sliding doors and separate areas allows you to section off the areas, still leaving a generous play area in the dressing room and bathroom to muck around in. 2. Convenient location – walking distance to shopping in Mitsukoshi Ginza, Tokyu Hands in Ginza, Muji/Loft. Lots of little ramen and other food shops within a 5 min walk. For greenery, the Imperial Palace and Hibiya Park are within easy reach. 1. Impeccable service. As we were there for the Tokyo Marathon, and constantly outdoors, we sometimes returned to the hotel looking wind-blown and felt slightly scruffy walking through the lobby, but the staff provided top-notch service and even lavished lots of attention on our little 2 year old toddler. Already looking forward to our next visit. Tokyo tip: Be sure to visit Mitsukoshi's food hall. it's amazing. Direct connections below the Peninsula means that if it's raining outside, you can get from your room into the food hall and back without having to step outside at all.

What we liked better about the Peninsula was the location. - Right on the Ginza strip and next to the Imperial Palace Where the Emporer himself is stumped up.It was fantastic to be 2 minutes walk to the most upmarket shopping strip in Tokyo and with the Palace next door you get a great place to go for morning walks and jogs. You can do that around the Imperial Palace perimeter gardens which are right accross the road and its a great way to start the day.We had a deluxe room in the Peninsula and we were pleasantly surprised to find that it was much larger than normal hotel rooms and beautifully appointed as you would expect from the Peninsula group. As with it's sister hotel we have stayed in the front of house staff are fantastic and they have the sort of culture that really makes you feel like you are being looked after.The appointments and features in the room are those you would expect to find in a suite and the whole place just ozzes class.In the lift lobby on the high floors there is a sculpture that stretches over most of the lift lobbies housed in its own dark mysterious area with windows in each lift lobby so that you can look at the sleek illuminated shapes in the chasm in the wall outside the lift lobbies.We think the Park Hyatt and the Peninsula are definately the two top 5 star hotels in Tokyo, but we think the Peninsula gets line honors due to the unbeatable location. Like it's sister hotels, the Peninsula Tokyo has helicopter landing facilities on the roof and the Seven Seas Aviation Lounge that is directly underneath it is a really cool lounge to sit in. It is all done out aviation style and has sections of jet aircraft wings suspended from the ceiling, as well as a number of other aviation articles placed throughout the lounge. It also has a very large glassed in balcony which you can walk out on and check out Tokyo as well as the Imperial Palace grounds. - Only one problem. - Helicopters are currently forbidden from landing there due to the close proximity to the Palace ! Whoops ! someone forgot to get the permit first. We understand that the hotel is negotiating to have helicopter landing availability with the Japanese government. - In the mean time you will have to toughen up Princess and make do with a current model Rolls Royce transfer from Narita airport.

The winter chill is setting in. But that also means Christmas is round the corner. The Peninsula in Tokyo is lit up. It is a beautiful building that is superbly located. Whether it's the 7-11 or the Cartier store, you can just walk it up. The Peninsula's main entrance lobby also serves as a restaurant so it gets a bit congested, but rest assured its only the entrance. Because when you walk into your room, space is not exactly the issue!The room I had had a view of the Tokyo skyline which is beautiful but the room itself is lavish. The corridor opens up to a large bathroom on the left and a walk-in closet + cupboards + dressing room. Straight ahead is a large room with two beds, a huge tv set and a bunch of sofas and a table. The quality of the stuff is top notch and the lighting is strategic. The room is designed to help you work as well as relax. The materials used are really unique and of high quality. There is an espresso machine too.The bathroom is really the place to hang out in! The super-sophisticated Japanese toilet seat has now gone one up - the lid lifts up when it senses you! What's next, I wonder. There is a small telly in the bathroom too. Two washbasins seem to be a needless extravagance, but what the hell.Breakfast is unusual in the sense it's not a buffet. You just order one of four options and they will ply you with the goodies. Sumptuous and terrific. Cribs are an overwhelming number of switches and controls - soon you just get tired of it. Other than that, the Peninsula is really a luxurious hotel and a proper indulgence.","Mumbai, India","srinik69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, India</strong>",81,5.0

I stayed there for a week and we were looked after from the moment we arrived at the hotel till we checked out. The quality of the deluxe room was exceptional. Initially, we were allocated a 9th floor room but wanting to have a view I had to upgrade to the deluxe rooms. From the room, there is a good view of the Imperial Palace and also the New Tokyo tower. The room is filled with gadgets and buttons and came with an espresso maker. Very very handy. I always dread staying at hotels because I like to have my coffee as soon as I wake up and having the machine is a wonderful touch. And if you need extra coffee cartridges, they were delivered very quickly. a thermometer reading of the outdoor is useful when figuring out what to wear. Every night, we were given fruits and bottles of water. Bathroom is sensational. It is well designed and for the first time, I did not see any moulds in corners. I stayed at hotels from both ends of the price spectrum and price is not really an indication of whether mould will be present or not. So it is wonderful to not be anxious every time I step into the shower. The pool is very clean and the attendant provides swimming caps, thongs and goggles. It's mandatory to wear the swimming caps and it keeps the pool free from hair. The gym is well equipped for a hotel and they lend trainers to those who did not bring their own. Service was excellent and friendly and seems to be tailored for the type of guests they receive. As we are laid back, we had a few banters while I saw the same staff being uber-polite to suit wearing stiffs. Laundry was delivered in a traditional box with a cloth wrapped around it.

I ordered Shanghai &  food.  Both were really good. The Shanghai food was surprisingly authentic although they did not have any Chinese brown  vinegar.  The Sichuan food was also decent and almost as good as Sichuan food in HK or Sichuan-Tsuruya in basement of hotel.   Food was good but not as memorable as other Kaiseki experiences.  - Peter's.  Pretty place on the top floor of the hotel.    I liked the wall with dancing figures.   The fusion food was innovative and locally inspired.    A good  place for a break if you've had too many Japanese meals in a row.  If you are here for a panoramic view, come during the day time. I had a corner table at night and unlike the Pen in HK, there was nothing to look at.  2) Conciege.  Great useful source to help arrange for booking of restaurants.  My restaurant booking confirmation came with a printed map with additional hand written instructions.  3) serenity & an urban oasis.   Despite being so close to Ginza, stylish zen rooms plus modern gym...nice comfy spacious room with inviting bathtub.  The gym was well equipped and the large pool was in a beautiful space with high ceilings.    Except on one occasion when the next roomful of  kids were awake, my room was completely peaceful and blissfully silent.  Cons.  1) Check in experience. While service here is gracious and sincere, there was a  long line for checking in--seemed to happen daily around 12 noon to 3:30 pm.    I got into the hotel at one ish but the room was not ready til past three so I ended up eating a lunch to kill time.  When I got to the reception three ish after waiting in line a 2nd time the room was still not ready so the receptionist asked if I had any plans to ""go out"".    I was tired but went for a walk in Ginza. Perhaps they could try in room check in, kiosk check in or mobile phone check in.      I was here for leisure but if on a biz trip I'd have been pretty irritated.  But in sum, a nice place I would not mind coming back to.  ","Hong Kong, China","Anilegna</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",787,4.0

In September 2010, I stayed for almost 2 weeks. Both times I had a deluxe room. It has a large walk-in wardrobe and a spacious bathroom. The long bath is separated from the standing shower and there are 2 washbasin areas on opposite sites – your partner will have his/her own. A wide range of toiletries was provided – hair brush, comb, shaver, vanity set, bath salts, shaving kit, shower cap, nails set, dental kit and the usual soap, shampoo, conditioner, bath gel. The size of the bathroom as well as the walk-in wardrobe areas are the equivalent of a small room in some hotels.The bathroom and walk-in wardrobe areas are separated from the bedroom area by a sliding door. The bedroom area consists of a sofa set with a large LCD wall mounted TV, a table by the window and double or a king size bed. In the latest stay, I had a corner room – even more spacious as there is a long corridor on entering the room door before reaching the above mentioned areas. The table by the window is great place to do your work, read etc. There is also a Lavazza coffee machine in the room. Internet connectivity was a breeze – both wired and wireless. No problems at all whether in the room or in the lobby. A bottle of water is provided each evening and everything in the room can be controlled via the control panel on the bedside table.Each morning they delivered the newspaper of my choice and also an additional newspaper. These are left in a box ie they open it from outside the room to put in the papers and I pick it up by opening the box from the inside of the room – no need to open the door to get the papers. Access to the room is via a key instead of key access card. The key needs to be inserted into a slot on the elevator panel after 10pm in order to gain access to the floor where the room is. It appears quite a lot of thought had been put into the design to ensure a good stay experience in the room. Coming off a hard day’s work, shopping or tour, the room is definitely something to look forward to – very relaxing. Kudos to the hotel for the spaciousness and good design.I tried the complimentary limo service they had to bring you to places close by. As it was raining that morning, I asked for the service and was brought to my office in a Rolls Royce! Given the excellent customer service in the hotel, I was a little surprised they missed my birthday during my latest stay - nothing from the hotel to acknowledge this – not even a card. I have had hotels give me a card and even a cake in the room – a very personalized touch which was missing in Peninsula.The open concept café/dining area in the lobby did not work for me – it was weird. People were eating at tables while others were just walking by – total lack of privacy. The Peter bar at the top floor of the hotel has wonderful views.The hotel is located in close proximity to Ginza and there are lots of restaurants within a short walking distance. A little far from Tokyo station and hence the best of getting to the hotel from and to Narita is via the Airport express as it drops and picks you at the doorstep. The bus schedule is not so regular and depending on your flight timing, potentially you may have to wait an hour for the bus. The alternative is to take the Narita express from Tokyo station – a short taxi ride away costing about 700 Yen.","Singapore, Singapore","marlin123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",19,5.0

There was a fax machine in the room to let me know if it was processed. So high tech.... But still warm touch everywhere.

You can see in them and vice versa, nothing much the hotel can do about this but as a consumer you should be aware unless you go for the room with the telescope, ( I forget the name of the room) you will not be looking out on the park, but rather at someones work desk.In conclusion this hotel is fantastic, pricey but fantastic.

Initially I was a little hesitant given the room rates but when we arrived I understood what all the raves were about and even why their prices were such. The attention to detail was incredible both in the rooms, bathrooms, amenities and service. All the staff went out of their way to be helpful so we made it a point to stop by the concierge to get all the directions, tips and information prior to going out daily.We had kids with us and there were little bathrobes and cookie decorating kits as well as bath amenities waiting for them in the room. They also loved the heated swimming pool which was off limits to children at certain times of the day to allow for adults to swim undisturbed.It is relatively close to the Imperial Palace, Ginza and the Tsukiji fish markets. For all other places, the hotel links directly to the underground subway hence very convenient for travel especially during winter or rainy days. The lobby was a little crowded with a restaurant squeezed in which removed the first impression 'grandness' you would expect. We liked their pastries at the cafe but did not enjoy breakfast at Peter's - the servings tended to be small and limited selection for breakfast buffet.

I had huge expectations on the Pen in Tokyo based on the reviews on this site and therefore even the slightest hiccup would lead to disappointment, and unfortunately that's what happened. First the good:The location of the hotel is simply the best - there is no better location in Tokyo for a leisure traveller. The rooms are a real treat as indicated by other reviews here and all the electronic wizardry certainly does keep one amazed and entertained. Service is also good, but not in the same league as the Four Seasons HK where we had just arrived from. ( I was never addressed by name) The beds were incredibly luxurious and the pool area was a real treat, as was the complimentary use of the hotel Rolls. The not so good:We were given a disabled room, which meant we had a modified bathroom with handles everywhere and it also meant that we only had one vanity. Whilst only a small issue, I feel that given the hotel was not full, this seemed unnecessary. At the very least reception should have made this known. On the night we arrived a asked reception a question which they could not answer and I was directed to the concierge desk where I had to repeat the question. This may seem like a small issue but I would have expected to be escorted to the concierge desk and the receptionist to have repeated my question to the concierge but this did not happen. Again, I'm only making these picky points based on other reviews on this site which indicate this property is flawless. The concierge desk is also too small and cramped given the size of the overall hotel and is only staffed by two, meaning sometimes you will need to wait for service, when in a hotel of this calibre you should never have to wait.There was only no fruit in the room, which was a strange omission. The toiletries were also not always replaced once they were used up or opened which was frustrating. Peter the restaurant is accessed via a separate elevator from the ground floor which is frustrating for guests as you have to go down them up again. The breakfast menu is very limited and the temperature of the food was lukewarm on almost all days - disappointing. I would also agree with others that the layout of the lobby is poor with those having breakfast sharing the floor with departing travellers. The rear door of the hotel is also not manned by a staff member when it really should be. Overall the hotel looks as though it's ""older"" than it really is, probably not helped by the red decor.Overall I enjoyed my stay but having read the reviews on this site, my expectations were so high that any slight flaw would be noted and detract from the overall experience and those flaws did exist. Look, staying here is a still a great experience, but comments like ""worlds best"" are simply misleading as anyone who has stayed at the Four Seasons Hong Kong will attest.","Melbourne, Australia","Ants48</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",61,4.0

We took advantage of the nanny service on three occasions and felt our daughter was in very safe hands. The concierge organised all of this for us (as well as dinner reservations and Disneyland tickets) and it was all seamless. We enjoyed quite a few room service meals (the joys of traveling with a little one mean you spend far more time in your room than you might otherwise). We were on a bed and breakfast rate so had the delicate and beautifully presented breakfast in the lobby each morning. It probably wasn't the greatest place for a very energetic 1 year old (given it is right in the middle of the lobby) but the staff kindly gave us crayons and colouring in sheets to keep her entertained. We also took advantage of the bakery shop in the basement - the sandwiches and pastries were delicious and we were able to enjoy the meals back in our room. The only let down was our one visit to the hotel bar. We were advised that we could only sit at the bar as all the tables near the windows were reserved - there was not one person in the bar at the time and by the time we left only one table was occupied. A slight let down after the fantastic service we had received elsewhere throughout the hotel. All in all a great stay and we look forward to returning next time we are in Tokyo.","Mount Pleasant, Australia","DenJenK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mount Pleasant, Australia</strong>",66,5.0

If I had to choose I'd probably pick the MO if they were the same price. Here is how the different attributes stack up, in my opinion:Location - P wins big, on the edge of the Imperial Gardens and Ginza. MO is a 20 min walk north from P.Rooms - P. P had much beds, bathtub and toilets (an artform in Japan). MO had much better shower and toiletries (incredible products, esp the bathsalts). The decor and layout were equally wonderful at both hotels, as were the views.Common Spaces - MO wins big. Though I am not a fan of the common MO setup of having the lobby on the top floor (requiring you to take two elevators from your room to the exit, one up to the lobby, another one down to the street), I loved the look and feel of this hotel - serene, lovely and efficient. Gorgeous views and architecture. P's setup is much more convenient, but the lobby feels small and chaotic with the restaurant planted right in the middle. Not a space where we wanted to linger in the least.  Service - MO wins big. P is fine, but MO goes above and beyond. The concierge staff at P was harried.Food - MO wins. The food at the restaurant in P's lobby was mediocre. The food in the casual cafe in the P basement is tasty but the location in the basement in not ideal. We didn't try ""Peter"", on the top floor of P, because the cigarette smoke was so strong.MO has five restaurants - four with incredible views, (including the all-day dining, more casual place which had a wonderful breakfast buffet) , three with Michelin stars. Gym - tie. P has a lovely pool, but the gym is small with no windows. MO's gym is bigger with great views, but no pool. Both had nice, new machines. Spa - P because of pricing.

Previously stayed at the Imperial, the Park Hyatt and Four Seasons. Comparison is made against these hotels.Pros:1) The Peninsula has an excellent location, right on top of the Hibiya station and near JR lines as well as Ginza. The hotel basement connects to the Hibiya underground station. The presence of the Imperial Palace grounds makes for lovely greenery which isn't all that common in Tokyo and a pleasant jogging spot during warmer seasons.2) The fact it has it's own building rather than simply being on the top floors of an office one like a number of other 5 star hotels in Tokyo is to this traveler a plus. The ability to feel you've stepped into the ""world"" of your hotel from the point of entering into the ground floor door is comforting.3) The room is quite simply the best in its class I've stayed in. I stayed in a Deluxe room. Size-wise, comparable to other 5 star hotels in Tokyo but the design, layout and it being relatively new works in its favour. The high-tech gadgets of Lavazza coffee maker, automated curtains and light dimmers, fax machine etc. are standard Peninsula fare but all executed professionally. The use of plenty of phones, the Japanese luxury electronic toilet and thoughtfully planned layout of these is exceptional. Combined with good threadcount Frette bedlinen, the room is the most restful I've ever stayed in thus far. It is surprising how many high-end hotels scrimp on bedlinen etc., a strange proposition since most people will spend the most time on the bed in the room.....but happily, not the Peninsula. The valet service and valet box are excellent ideas and quite useful. The bathroom is smaller than most, as noted by previous reviews, but that is because space has been given to a walk-in wardrobe. In my opinion, the 2 combine to a bathroom/dressing area and I was not put off by this. It was a better use of space.4) The concierge service was better than any I've encountered in Tokyo. While some of the staff seemed a little harassed, given notice, they performed impeccably. All my reservations for restaurants, including some rather notoriously difficult ones were obtained and they had even went the extra mile to get the restaurants to give me private rooms at no extra cost to myself. One of their staff deserves special mention. Ms. Misako Kobayashi. While a junior concierge, she is quite simply the best concierge I have ever encountered, going out of her way to help us out of a jam we were in during our stay, even personally accompanying one of my party out of the hotel and staying back past her shift, close to midnight to ensure things went smoothly. Nothing short of amazing.Cons:Relatively minor in the scheme of things but areas that, in my opinion, can be easily corrected to turn them into clearing the best hotel in Tokyo and definitely among the best I've stayed in globally.1) The housekeeping is spotty. This is the real major letdown for the hotel really.The first night, I sent a pair of comfortable walking shoes for polishing and they were returned within an hour, but hardly cleaned, much less polished. They were scruffy and in needing of a good doing up but that was the reason I sent them. What ended up happening was I then sent across an expensive pair of lace-ups with the walking shoes and only then did they come back nice and polished, neatly placed in the shoe-bags all good hotels provide. Not exactly appropriate housekeeping.A member of my party requested for a flatsheet which was promptly provided but then subsequently removed without notice the next morning.The usual complimentary note with weather for the next day was left on the first night and then subsequently was not provided for the rest of the stay.A snack was provided on the first night but tea/snack for all subsequent days was not provided. While seemingly minor, this is a point that all good international 5 stars belabor to provide, a snack which is not repeated too frequently in the room and the lack of it in the hotel stands out.All in all, most were minor points but taken all together, did mar the experience somewhat and fall short of the luxury standards set by other top hotels. 2) The lobby is an attempt to recreate the Hongkong flagship's look, which is the presence of tea cafes as one enters with the reception tucked away in a corner and a string quartet playing. Problem is that the HK hotel has a large, wide lobby where the sense of space of the entrance to reception is not crowded out by the tea/cafe areas and plenty of sitting space is still available. A narrower, smaller space, the Tokyo Pen ends up feeling cramped and the serenity and sense of exclusiveness of the award-winning interior design is lost. Being one's first impression of the hotel, this is disappointing.The HK branch does not serve hot meals in my memory, at these lobby cafes or has a much better exhaust system because I did not encounter the smells of food in it the way I did in the Tokyo Pen. Not always the most pleasant experience.They should have moved the cafe back of the ground floor given the narrow space and saved the lobby for its usual purpose alone or at least not design it to crowd on both sides of the lobby, creating a sense of claustrophobia on staying guests needing to walk through it to get to rooms.Overall, the Tokyo Pen is a great hotel, with the fantastic rooms and wonderful concierge being assets that stand heads over their competition in town. Yes, the rooms are pricey but comparable to other 5 star hotels in Tokyo and still competitively priced compared to NY and London. Their letdowns are the spotty housekeeping with skipping of minor benefits like the afternoon snack provided by their competitors and a rather poorly laid out lobby which is detrimental to first impressions.","London, United Kingdom","hanyu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",66,5.0

We've stayed at around 6 or 7 hotels in Japan and none were as expensive as The Peninsula, so expectations were very high.I love modern design, and many Japanese hotels tick all my boxes. But The Peninsula doesn't quite work for me - and I feel kind of sad about it.We arrived at check-in, and were immediately asked if we'd like to purchase an upgrade. Sensibly I asked to see the suite they were offering - and at over £800 a night one should. And it did the trick, we were bowled over and took the large corner suite with fabulous views of the Ginza and the railways tracks with the Shinkasen hurtling past every few minutes. Blade Runner was close to becoming reality - and for me that's a good thing.I don't fault our suite at all. It was heaven - and if I could have moved in I would have. During our stay the weather wasn't that great - but that really meant enjoying the suite all the more. I think they've thought of everything - and we wanted for nothing.In retrospect I can't help but feel that being asked at check-in if we'd like to buy an upgrade a little tacky - and very un-Japanese. Yes, it worked in all our favour, but it still seems tacky.Regards design: I hated the fact that breakfast is basically at the entrance to the hotel. So you're eating while people are coming in and meeting up with business associates, or wedding parties - or whoever else wants to walk through the hotel. I think this is a badly thought out concept. On the plus side it's nice to not be dealing with the usual buffet breakfast, however, it still wasn't a good breakfast and the 'hot' food which was delivered to the table arrived luke warm. Plus, don't give guest a several slices of toast and one silly little pat of butter so they have to keep requesting more. Breakfast should (for adults) be a pleasant bit of quiet luxury time before the day gets started - no-one wants to keep asking for things by trying to catch the attention of a waiter.On the Sunday the hotel was apparently so full that they put on a buffet breakfast way up on the top floor. I was pleased about this as I knew the views would be great and we could avoid the previous days iffy food and service. However, it was a total shambles. I'm not convinced the staff were full time Peninsula employees. To be blunt we would rather have had breakfast outside the hotel.Regards design (again): the top floor bar, Peter, is great for views and has a nice atmosphere. But who designed the dreadful slippery seating? I do not tell a lie when I state people were actually making fun of the seating in the way that they were sort of pretending they were like kids again on a slide in the playground slipping off the edge.The hotel location is excellent for the subway and the Ginza. But, even if I had endless pots of money to splash out on the suite we had again, I don't think we'd stay at this particular Peninsula again. And that's a shame as I do need to go back to Japan quite a lot, and as far as we're concerned I strongly suspect we'll return to The Ritz Carlton who provided a superior service.I'm now supposed to make a decision as to whether I'd recommend this hotel to a friend. And the honest answer is, I don't know. It really depends on what you want from a hotel. I'd probably suggest staying elsewhere, but go to The Peninsula for cocktails - or, if you can afford one of the excellent suites then have a room service breakfast.",London,"Serial_Traveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",441,4.0

There are many restaurants near the hotel, so if you don`t want to spend a fortune in the hotel restaurants, there are some nice places nearby. Probably the only complaint would be the hotel prices, the restaurants are very expensive but the food quality is great. The spa and pool are also great, I took my 5 year to the pool and she loved it. The pool attendants were great. The hotel rooms are very spacious and very modern.

I actually added Peter’s Bar and Restaurant to my list of all-time favourites as soon as I set foot in them. Not quite surprising, the bar can get very crowded at cocktail time, but the waiters are very friendly and willing to help you get a table at the window so that you can admire the cityscape at dusk, a view that should not be missed if, like me, you are a first-time visitor to Tokyo. After having enjoyed a couple of excellent white wines at the bar, my partner and I also enjoyed a superb dinner at Peter’s Restaurant. Portions, like everywhere in Tokyo, are rather small, but the quality of every single item we had was exquisite. All in all, I can highly recommend this hotel.

To date, I have stayed there on four different occasions. Each time everything is so understated and well executed, it is easy to overlook just how well things are done here. They make everything appear effortless. Since my first stay they greet me by name, know that I prefer a blanket and not a duvet, understand I prefer a high floor, etc. The executive room is extremely spacious by Tokyo standards. The bed is very comfortable with good reading lights and easy to understand controls by the bed for lights, thermostat, alarm clock, and the black-out shades and sheers. The sofa and lounge chair are comfortable. There is also a small dining / work table with two chairs by the window. Flanking a large flat screen HD television is a built-in desk on one side and a cabinet on the other side which houses a coffee maker, bar and refrigerator.My only issue is with the desk. It's small and the desk chair is not very ergonomic. It's also a little low for the desk. However the rooms have wireless internet so I take my laptop to the table by the windows and work there (with a view of the Imperial Palace). I have yet to be able to print from the room's combination fax / printer, but the business center allows me to print for free.The bathroom is very well designed with a giant soaking tub and a large separate shower outfitted with both a rain-type shower head and a good hand-held spray shower. The water pressure in the shower is amazing. There are 2 vanities with sinks and the toilet is in a separate compartment. The towels are large and there are two types of robes provided.The huge walk-in closet is incredible and makes unpacking a pleasure rather than an ordeal. (An iron and ironing board would be a most welcome addition.) The closet has two walls for hanging clothes, adequate drawer space, a safe, and a dressing table and stool.The lobby restaurant is small but adequate for breakfast or lunch. It quickly fills up most days by 10am with ""the ladies that lunch"" crowd and remains full all day. The wester-style American breakfast is excellent, as is the coffee. There is usually live music being played from a balcony overlooking the lobby.The bar and lounge on the top floor are not quite on the level with what you saw in ""Lost in Translation"". Except on weekends, you can usually find a place at the bar. They have a very good bar menu for a light snack or late night meal.The health club is complimentary and while small, it is well equipped. The workout room was seldom crowded between 6:30am - 8:30am when most would be. The pool, for those that swim, is amazing with windows overlooking the Imperial Gardens across the road. I have used the services of the spa and it is very nice.The staff all through the hotel are wonderfully attentive and helpful. I commend them for the exceptional level of service, which even by Tokyo's already high standards, is top notch without being fussy.The hotel's location, between the Ginza and the Imperial Palace, is perfect for anyone having to get around the city or is looking for an interesting place to walk around and shop or sightsee.I travel to Asia frequently and the Peninsula Tokyo stands out for exceptional service, comfortable, well designed rooms, a great location, and overall great value.",Chicago,"Chicago60657</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago</strong>",21,5.0

There was a seating area with dinning table for two, a king-sized bed, a lovely bathroom with his and her sinks, a dressing area and a luggage area. The room had all the basic amenities, modern technology and complimentary wi-fi. Some of the amenities I really love was the nail dryer, the mood lighting, the bathroom's spa option (lights were dimmed and music played), the beside controller (for visually everything in the room), the humidity controller, the coffee/tea making machine, the valet box (for newspapers & laundry delivery) and the cellphone for use within the hotel. The room was modern, stylish and comfortable.Service:Just like the room itself, the service of the hotel staff was perfect. Everyone was extremely polite, helpful and spoke excellent English. I was especially charmed by the housekeeping, concierge and room service staff. The concierge for example, led me all the way from the hotel lobby to the nearest subway station, instead of just giving me a map and directions like most hotels would. I also had a lovely chat with the room service staff and the housekeeping staff went out of their way to make my stay the most comfortable one.All of my needs were met and I have to admit I am very impressed with their service.Location:The hotel was right on top of a subway station (Hibiya) and within walking distance from the Ginza shopping district. A convenience store 7-11 and local fast food restaurant Freshness Burger are located across the street. Conclusion:The Peninsula Tokyo is possibly the best hotel I have ever stayed in in Tokyo.

The 22nd Century toilet seat in the bath (which, after an ill-advised late-night rice ball from the 7/11 across the street, I learned you can actually fall asleep on) & the nail dryer in the walk-in closet on their own are enough to recommend the place.Add a concierge desk that gave great guidance without ever condescending, stunning design, & a dream location & it sounds perfect. That's what made the gracelessness of the exit so jarring it made us doubt the sincerity of all the courtesy that came before - kind of like a kick in the pants & a shove out the door.Here's what happened. Generally, taking a shuttle bus to the airport is kind of low rent move, but in Tokyo, where The Peninsula car to Narita is US$650 & even minivan service is over US$200, taking the shuttle bus just means you are not totally willing to take your money, put it in a little pile, & set it on fire.So, after checking out, we sat to wait for the bus on one of the admittedly (and, in hindsight, probably intentionally) tiny & uncomfortable couches that flank the entrance corridor, carefully tucking our small carry-ons between us so that they extended into the walkway no further than our feet did. This arrangement did not work at all for the floorwalker running the lobby, who marched over & rather insistently asked to check our bags.The tone from the beginning was not of helpfulness but more like we were breaking a rule, creating a hazard, harming the aesthetics of the lobby. We politely declined as the bags were unlocked & my wife had jewelry in hers.He spun heel & he was replaced by an even unfriendlier sort, who at one point tried to carry the bags away. Mind you, the bags were not blocking the corridor & were Prada & LV duffels, not quite plastic garbage bags (if that matters).After another polite refusal, the rude dude returned again & even though the bus pick up was 10 minutes away started pointing us toward the door where a group of other ""guests"" who had probably been bullied out of the lobby just before us were huddled. At this point, my NY background bubbled to the surface & I proceeded to set back international relations some 70 years.In retrospect, it is clear that the lobby is not for the convenience of loitering former guests. They want to keep it pristine so the folks that have just laid down nearly a Grand a night don't sully the atmosphere for their overrated, tourist-trap cash cow ""afternoon tea at The Peninsula"".This is a real problem that we hope they fix because otherwise it's a fantastic hotel, truly one of the best in the world. Will consider returning but certainly not until October when flights from HK to Haneda begin & private car service should be more reasonable - definitely will not ever wait in that lobby again (which, unfortunately & infuriatingly, is exactly what they want).",Hong Kong,"JayODHK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",56,4.0

It is one of the few hotels that is free-standing, not part of a larger office building or shopping center. The rooms are beautifully appointed. We stayed in a corner suite which was over the top; however I did see a regular room and that was just as beautifully decorated. The corner suite has a large living room, separate bedroom entered through a very large dressing area, spacious bathroom, powder room, and both the living room and the bedroom have direct views of the Imperial Palace. It felt like our own apartment. The gym, which was located in the spa, had excellent equipment and was well staffed. There is a beautiful pool in the spa. All the employees that we came in contact with spoke fluent English and were very helpful. The concierge arranged a visit to the Imperial Palace (which needs to be done a day in advance), bought our train tickets to Kobe, and was very helpful with restaurant reservations.My only complaint is that on their website they mention that there is a complimentary hotel car to take you to local stops but when i asked about it on at least three different occasions, no one at the hotel seemed to know what I was talking about. The hotel should not offer something which it is not willing to provide.

We loved every part of it and really could not think of a single negative. Our room was the best city hotel room we have ever stayed in- the layout is perfect. The bathroom/ dressing area is separated from the sleeping area. This was great because I always got up earlier than my husband. The closet/dressing area is awesome with a vanity in the closet and plenty of hanging room, suitcase space & shopping bag space. The bathroom has a ""spa"" button when pressed the lights dim and the spa music comes on! The space is perfectly set up for traveling, enough space for 2 huge suitcases, very comfortable and easy to feel at home. We had a park view which was perfect because we were lucky enough to be there during the cherry blossoms and were able to see the trees from our room at breakfast every morning. Room service was prompt, great selection and beautiful presentation. The spa was fabulous, especially the relaxation room. Did not try the indoor pool. We tried Sunday afternoon high tea- it was lovely. The lobby bar seamed to be the place to be for Tokyo's lunching ladies so it was fun to be around them- very bustling, sophisticated and high energy. Also, on the weekend there was a wedding everyday. In the basement you can get food to go- for a picnic in the gardens. We tried the rooftop lounge for lunch and drinks- great view, drinks, and delicious lunch. The hotel is 5 min walk to Ginza and the Royal Gardens- loved that. The service and staff were perfect, gracious and kind. Will definitely go back to the Peninsula next time we are in Tokyo!","San Francisco, CA","lovetotravel702</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, CA</strong>",83,5.0

The master control was to die for; you could even adjust the room humility. Great sound system, choice of room lighting was brilliant! The room was huge with separate dressing room and a enormous bathroom. You will get a kick out of the toilet but tend to spend a bit too long fiddling with the various controls :-) The WC was discretely separated from main bathroom) !Staff extremely helpful and polite and spoke very good English. We hired the hotel's BMW bikes so we could cover a lot of area in a much quicker time than if we had walked. The bike hire was a bit too pricey, however we had a great time. This hotel is not cheap but pretty much on par with other 5 star hotels in Tokyo, so it was well worth the money. Peter's restaurant was smokey and overpriced and nothing to write home about. Our room had just as good a view as Peter's so after dinner we purchased champagne and we enjoyed the wonderful view in private.

Prior to this trip, I'd given up on 5 star hotels, thinking all of them had impersonal, disinterested service and that the only thing they were interested in was squeezing your dollars out of you. Our stay at the Peninsula Tokyo changed my mind. Completely. Everything and everyone was excellent. The front desk took seriously our dissatisfaction with our first room. The concierge desk dealt with (almost) all of our requests for help with restaurant bookings, maps for taxi drivers, directions to places, ticket bookings with great efficiency and capability. The spa has excellent facilities and service (I went for a second treatment because it was so good and I knew I'd get nothing like it back in London). The pool is spectacularly clean. The gym is well equipped (for a hotel). Room service is good. The room itself is magnificent - spacious beyond belief (especially for a big city), with a separate walk in closet and dressing room, a nice bath (that is separate from the WC), and with great technology that they've really thought about (they have their own R&D division working out how to make guests feel more comfortable in the room - as a techie, I was impressed). Location is good for good restaurants.Negatives were very, very few. (1) The Concierge desk is a bit overwhelmed - there is often a queue (because lots of people need help in a city with language barriers) and staff get very tired towards the end of the day. It really needs to be expanded. (2) The Hei Fung Terrace restaurant was really not impressive. This needs some work. (3) The website shouldn't really sell some of their rooms as 'Park View' rooms. In truth, the Deluxe Park View rooms are directly facing a large white office building, and the view of the park is at an angle to the side. You'll only get any kind of serious view of the park if you're as far West as possible in the corridor (or, if you want a view directly over the park, if you book a Suite). If you are booking a Deluxe Park View, ask for as high a floor as possible (it goes up to 22) and ask for, e.g., 2202 or 2203 (which are as far down the corridor as possible, closer to the park).Highly recommend this hotel.

It was a fantastic stay. The staff of the Peninsula are extremely friendly and polite and assisted at any moment. Getting there is Narita airport was easy. A specific Airport Limousine Bus from Narita will take you directly to the hotel within 90 mins at a cost of ¥ 3000 pp.The rooms are superbly furnish and spacious. I stayed on the 20th floor overlooking the city. Upon check-in we were asked what type of room we wished to have. We were advised that a park view room (looking over the Imperial Palace gardens) is nice during the day, but at night it is in complete darkness, so the night skyline would be a better option. We decided to take their advise and we weren't disappointed.The hotel is located above 2 metro lines (Hibiya and Chiyoda lines) and in walking distance to another (Ginza line), making it extremely easy to travel around Tokyo. The area itself is not a lively area at night - as it is mainly a shopping and financial district. However Shinjuku is only 10 mins by metro and 20 mins by taxi, so you can definitely have a lively evening out in Shinjuku and make your way back to the hotel without too much hassle.The only disappointment I had about my stay at the Peninsula Tokyo was the food standard at the Chinese restaurant on the 2nd floor. I found the food uninspiring and dull - food you would find in any mid-range city restaurant. It was certainly not worth the price. Unbeknown to me, it is actually a Michelin star restaurant, which I found out 2 days after dining there, making my experience even worse. There are much better quality (and more satisfying) restaurants close by at Marunouchi Brick Square complex - which we were recommended by the Concierge.I have now stayed at 2 Peninsula hotels - Bangkok and Tokyo - and overall find the Peninsula hotel chain one of the best (if not the best) in the world.",Australia,"wheresjay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",37,5.0

She confirmed with the airline what the situation was, sent us up boxes and labels, and then had someone come up to pick them up for shipping - that alone made the high cost of the room worth every penny.

And that's just the bathroom! Everything is hi-tech but not without purpose. I tried to fold up the bed and fit it in my suitcase!I will with out a doubt be staying there on my return visit to Tokyo.

We've stayed at several other Peninsula's before, and although Peninsula Tokyo's lobby is not as grand as the others, it still is by far one of the top 3. the service, the location, the unique decor and the class that it exudes makes you feel like royalty. you really feel like you are in tokyo. don't be fooled by its tiny lobby because in tokyo this is quite common. in fact, many of the other luxury hotels in tokyo (grand hyatt, park hyatt, four season etc) are connected to malls or office buildings and so their lobbies are almost non-existent. peninsula tokyo, on the other hand, has its own 24 story building. also, there is a direct entrance to the hibiya subway line which pretty much connects to the other nice areas of tokyo, like roppongi, tsukiji etc. ginza, where peninsula is located, is by far the most up-scale neighborhood in tokyo but still manages to preserve its antiquity (the famous Imperial Palace & Garden is right across the Peninsula!) ALL IN ALL, I WOULD STAY AT THE PEN TOKYO MANY, MANY, MANY MORE TIMES! Very, very PRICEY, but definitely, definitely WORTH IT. Oh, our room was so clean, spacious and technologically advanced (think massage toilets and BILINGUAL TELEVISION!), and even equipped with daily fresh fruits and a sweets platter. We were totally spoiled but loved it! Oh, and the food at the lobby is EXCELLENT!!!!! Peters (the bar) is also breathtaking, with perhaps a view that beats Park Hyatt's.",Asia,"AsiaAroundtheworld</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Asia</strong>",23,5.0

The first 4 nights we had a Executive Suite and the second 4 nights a Deluxe Suite. As usual the service and the hotel were excellent. We enjoyed once very good dinner at Peters and occasionally the room service for breakfast or dinner. Both were very good. The rooms are really spacious and have everything you need, including a good espresso machine. They even have gadget like a memory card ready for looking at pictures direct on the TV. Sadly this didn’t work as expected and also the stereo system in the room had not a good sound setup. But everything else is just fantastic and you notice a lot of attention to details. We really loved the room plan which included a separate large dressing room and grand bathroom with a nice view from the bathtub – especially at night times. This is in any case a very nice feature of the corner rooms because they include multiple windows with overwhelming views throughout Ginza.

It felt like ‘home’ in fact on returning to the hotel one was always greeted with a ‘welcome back’. We took advantage of the sweet dreams promotion which offered a suite for half price – and what accommodation – it was like an apartment but without a kitchen. Spacious and comfortable, attractively designed and with every possible amenity – it was very difficult to tear oneself away from it. Excellent housekeeping, linens, toiletries etc.Enjoyed very good meals and service in both Peter and Hei Fung Terrace where Kosuke Yamashita provided particularly personable and friendly service.Pre arrival, the concierge provided friendly and efficient service and throughout my stay everything worked like clockwork. Wonderful location with direct access to the Metro and an easy walk to Tokyo station (even with luggage). Convenient for all the wonderful neighbouring up market shops, the Ginza strip, Hibiya Park and the Imperial Gardens.Highly recommended!","McGregor, South Africa","macsym</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>McGregor, South Africa</strong>",109,5.0

After asking on the forum for the best located hotel for ""seeing the sights"" I was steered torwards this one. And its location is the first thing that strikes you when you arrive. It is surrounded by dozens of shops and restaurants from absolute top end to the great ""locals''. It is easy walking distance to the Ginza strip and even the fish market (prob 30 mins though). There is also plenty of public transport surrounding the hotel.The hotel and service is as what most other reviewers have said. Huge, luxurious rooms, great spa facility, top restaurants and bars and amazingly attentive and friendly service. The conceirge and reservations were helpful in the weeks leading up to my stay ensuring all my room requests were met and booking a local tour for me. I couldn't fault any part of my stay. The pricing is not cheap however I booked a deluxe room through a US website (from nextag) and got a great all inclusive rate in US dollars (good for Kiwis at the moment). I don't think you could be disappointed with this hotel however at any price.We at the lobby cafe which was great and also at Peter. This had superb views over Tokyo and a nice bar. We also used a lot of the local establishments - these included an English pub, German beer house, Italian restaurant and of course lots of great tradional Japanese restaurants. All these eateries are within 5 mins.It was my first time to Tokyo and thoroughly enjoyed it. Some great highlights included Nikko temples (and bullet train ride to them), fish market, watching the All Blacks play at National Stadium, great shops at Ginza, superb food everywhere and such friendly, polite locals.The limosine bus service was super easy getting to and from the airport for first timers. The train system is pretty full on but as long as you show the locals your tickets they happily show the right direction. We survived without getting lost! The taxis are very reasonable for getting around the city and are plentiful and clean.In summary, I would rate this as the best hotel I have stayed at by far. The service levels put everywhere in my part of the world to shame. They also just seem to of thought of everything to make your stay extra luxurious in the rooms. I would highly recommend this hotel as a great base for your Tokyo experience.",Auckland New-Zealand,"sandluc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland New-Zealand</strong>",15,5.0

I have stayed here twice for a total of 3 weeks, both times on business, and I am unable to come up with any criticism of any kind. I particularly like the location right opposite the Imperial Palace and next to all the shops in Ginza, also very close to the station for trains to the airport. The swimming pool is also worth a special mention, the pool and changing rooms are spotless with a great view, it is a fantastic place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing or at work.",Hong Kong,"BasilFawltyHK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",0,5.0
