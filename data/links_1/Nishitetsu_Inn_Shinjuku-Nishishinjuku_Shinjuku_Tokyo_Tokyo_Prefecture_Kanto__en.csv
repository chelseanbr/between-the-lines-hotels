They ended up ringing me an ambulance, and after attending hospital i had to return home & cut my holiday short after only 2 days. It took the reception staff about 90 minutes to work out what to do. I can not believe that in today's world,in a big city like Tokyo, that you don't have a doctor service on call.

ROOMS - A queen bed (aka large double) non smoking room inbound and then twin bed non smoking room on the way out of Tokyo. Quiet. clean, comfy. Twin room a bit better, but both excellent. Note - most beds in Japan are firmer than NA standards. I contacted hotel directly and they found me twin room several weeks after I booked the large double room. They are very responsive.

We actually take the east exit out of Shinjuku where the JR ticket office is, go outside and use the short tunnel and nearly a straight shot to hotel. Less busy and tricky than the busier west exit suggested by the hotel. And the JR ticket office was handy for booking ongoing travel etc. AMENITIES - fridge, kettle, instant coffee/tea.

Perhaps because we stayed over a weekend, the price was higher than I expected. Having said that, I think the hotel provided fairly good value for money, especially taking into account its location in Nishi-Shinjuku.In terms of room size, the room was a little larger than a comparable property which I had booked about a year ago. I found it acceptable for Shinjuku standards. The bed was fairly comfortable, but I found the pillow a little hard. As for location, the hotel is about a 2-minute walk from Nishi-Shinjuku station, and about a 10 to 15-minute walk from the main Shinjuku area. We took the subway only when we had our luggages, and found it straightforward to walk to and from Shinjuku otherwise. In my opinion, this was a more economical option than booking a hotel closer to the main Shinjuku station itself, which would either have been far more expensive, or provide less quality.This hotel is a great base from which to explore the Shinjuku/Harajuku/Shibuya area, and if you are looking to take external trips to and from Tokyo, most of which start from the Shinjuku transport hub. For example, the Keio railway line to Mount Takao can be taken from Shinjuku station and the expressway bus to Kawaguchiko can be boarded from Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal. Nishi-Shinjuku is also on the Marunouchi subway line and allows for easy access to the Ginza area. The hotel is also near a few convenience stores. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone searching for a value-for-money option near to Shinjuku station.","Singapore, Singapore","hungrymonster90</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",7,4.0

Anywhere else that respects itself (maybe not in Japan) I would have got a full refund of the 40%. At the end got to a compromise (which really should have not been the case in any service provider that respect itself) and got about half the difference back where it should have really been the whole amount I paid for no reason.","Melbourne, Australia","Shay M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",7,2.0

We had not stayed in Tokyo before, so it was a new experience. The hotel is in a fabulous location, a five minute walk from Shinjuku station, and surrounded by lots of restaurants and bars. The twin room we had was small, to be expected for Japan, but is very efficiently designed so that you don't feel cramped at all. Very modern decor. The attention to detail is spot on, even the bathroom mirror has a coating in the middle so it doesn't fog up when showering. A stunning bonus is the complimentary smart phone with google maps, lists of attractions and restaurants, which you can take with you on sightseeing trips.There is a counter next to the lifts which has complimentary toiletries, shavers, combs etc. which I've never seen before, and is a lovely touch.. The desk staff are all extremely pleasant, especially Li, who solved a couple of problems for me. Nothing is too much trouble for them, and they are always smiling and welcoming.The coffee shop attachéd to the hotel is great for pastries, coffee and icecream. The Japanese restaurant downstairs is cheerful, with a very reasonably priced menu, and tasty food. There's a McDonalds across the road, and a Seven Eleven a few yards away.A tip: make sure you confirm the room type beforehand, as we did not receive the twin room requested by our travel agent, and had to change to another room the morning after arrival. We would highly recommend the Nishitetsu Inn as a great base for exploring Tokyo.","Melbourne, Australia","christine h</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",10,5.0

The location is pretty good. Its about a 15 walk from Shinjuku Station, but it is pretty close to Nishi-Shinjuku subway station. Nearby are convenience stores, shopping, cafes including Starbucks across the street (underground), and McDonald's across the street for when you need a break from Japanese cuisine. Checking in was extremely easy, even though I showed up late at night. The front staff is efficient and speaks several foreign languages. I saw many foreign guests, so it seems the hotel is proficient at serving them. Yes, like many hotels in this range in Tokyo, the single room I had was pretty small. However, it was clean and had everything needed for a short stay. It may be a bit challenging if you have a big suitcase. The bed itself was comfortable enough. There was a small fridge, small desk, and small TV. The free Wifi was pretty good, and the AC worked fine. There is no closet, which I found to be a minor hassle. The bathroom is also not spacious, which is on par for most Japanese hotels. However, it is (perhaps just barely) manageable, and the Shiseido bath products were fine. You can hear a little outside noise from the room, but it was never a problem for me in my stay. Checking out was super speedy and hassle free... possibly the fastest hotel check out I've ever experienced haha. Just turned in the room key and I was done. In the end, this is a good choice for this price range, especially for short stays. I may return for weekend trips to Tokyo.

Location - 2 minute walk from Nishi-Shinjuku station. Shinjuku is a huge district by itself so you can take a walk, about 5-10 mins to the start of the action. 7-11 and Family Mart are very conveniently located near the hotel.2.

Memory foam pillows are available upon request (subject to availability)4. Staff were generally helpful when we seeker their assistance 5. Comfortable bed The cons:1. Security - The hotel lifts can be accessed by anyone as they do not require guests to tap their room card before pressing the floor button. I find this odd after having stayed in 3-star hotels across APAC with the similar security function yet this hotel doesn’t have.2. Cleaning service - 2 times our trash was left in our room, we had to clear ourselves. 3. No preset seat warmer for toilet - ugh!4. Check-out is 10am. Didn’t really affect us though.5. Overall service - Not consistent. I felt our hotel in Osaka was much better as all the staff we met were consistent in their service attitude and friendly whenever they met the guests (including us). Some of the staff don’t greet the guests and some returned items/money with one hand. The moment when we entered the hotel we knew. Quite disappointed with the inconsistency, considered the price we paid.This hotel is quite popular with tourists. But to summarise my overall experience, I wouldn’t return.

Located just 100m from the Nishi-Shinjuku station, hotel is super convenient to access even if you are hauling multiple luggage. My most favorite thing about the hotel was the welcoming vibe and super clean feel. It was very inviting after a day spent roaming around Tokyo in crowded subways and streets. The floors are tastefully designed and while the rooms are small they are very comfortable with a water boiler and good quality bathing accessories. They also have a coffee shop at the ground floor which opens early and stays open till late. We also left our luggage here for 4 nights when we travelled outside Tokyo and the staff was super helpful. They also have Laundry and vending machines on a few floors.

We tried to request for a non-smoking room during the booking and guess no luck.the corridor has terrible ventilation and the smell was chokingly awful. The room was initially bearable. However when the air con was on, I could not stop coughing. I guess the irritants from cigarettes have circulated through the ventilation. We had to switch off the aircon for the stay and open windows even though it's cold outside. Thankfully they did have an air purifier in the room though it did not help much. I tried calling the staff at night again to see if they could swap us to another room the next day as we were staying here for two nights. But he told me this is the only room for you.Other than this, we booked for two people but when we arrived into our room, there was only one set of amenity in the room. But the reception staff was helpful, apologetic and rearranged the amenities immediately. The room itself was clean but small. If you were travelling as a couple, you need to make ways for each other to move around the room. It also has little room for you to open your luggage (we only have one big suitcase with us and we could not keep it opened as there was no space). This issue could have been resolved if they have rearranged the furniture a bitTo be fair, its location was good and that was the reason we picked it in the first place. In fact the check in staff was polite and spoke ok English. However the irritation I got from the poorly ventilated smoking floor has heavily discounted my experience with this hotel.

This is a business hotel and definitely not catered for tourists. Having said that, if you're in Japan for a holiday I would recommend you look elsewhere to save yourself any mishaps like we experienced. As our stay was towards the end of my month long holiday in Japan I had quite a bit of luggage. The hotel does not seem to know how to accomodate for this. When asked for a luggage trolley the tiniest flat wheelie came out - enough to put 2 backpacks on it (bit of a joke). However front desk personnel helped us to our room with all our bags so that was nice of him. The room is a typical Japanese sized hotel room - small. I'd grown quite accustomed so it didn't really bother me. However you really do have to live out of your suitcase in this case. The room itself was clean and tidy, no complaints. With ammenities, you have to restock yourself from the lobby (there's a selection of shavers, toothbrushes, cleansing oils, body scrub towels etc.). If you want Lipton tea, they place a box selection right on the front desk counter, so help yourself. The location is not too bad, it was a short stroll to Shinjuku station -10mins. There's subway stations entrances scattered a long the street so transportation was a breeze. Connected to the hotel is a coffee shop downstairs so it was convenient for when you wanted a coffee first thing in the morning. There's 7/11, Natural Lawson and Can-Do (100 yen shop) literally a few lots down from the hotel so that was very convenient for when you want a late night snack or drinks. It's basic, no fuss, mediocre kind of stay. The stay itself I had no problems with. However if you're there for service - forget it! Upon check-out my partner and I lugged all our stuff to the lobby and asked the front desk lady if one taxi would be able to fit all our stuff. She said there's no way. Which was fine by me, I asked her to book us two taxis. She did so and advised us that it was going to be a 15 mins wait. My partner and I happily waited but by 40 mins we grew impatient especially when we were only going 20 mins away. I then approached front desk to enquire about my taxi bookings. Told him I've been waiting for 40 mins. He looked shocked, told me he was checking and picked up the phone. I gather he was checking with the taxi company. There was a lot of confusion but none of the 5 to 6 people behind front desk told us what was going on! Communication people. They just looked at me, while talking in Japanese amongst themselves (probably about the situation but how in gods name I'm I meant to know anything if they don't talk?). I get that Japanese people aren't accustomed to confrontation - I fully understand but hey what the heck was going on? I got fed up and demanded someone give me an answer, are the taxis coming or what?! Still nothing - no one said anything and one by one they disappeared through a door behind the front desk. I tell you, I'd have better luck if I had just waved two down myself on the street! Eventually after checking out at 10am, I was on my way at 11:20am. Absolutely ridiculous! What should have been a no brainer easy transaction became a nightmare! And that's just ordering taxis going locally - good luck if you have a flight to catch! On top of this when I was riding one taxi and my partner the other with our luggage spilt half and half the taxi driver told me ""you didn't need two taxis, you can fit all in one""...Great.

The staff were helpful whenever I needed something. The location is good as it's very close to the metro and a 7-11 is nearby. It's walking distance from a lot of restaurants and stores, and nightlife. The only complaint I have is that in order to turn off the room light at night to sleep I had to take the keycard out of the slot, which cut the electricity to the room. That meant I couldn't charge my phone, batteries, tablet, etc. So, after the first night I had to sleep w/the lights on. Perhaps installing a light switch in each room would help.

Our room was small but clean and pretty compactly designed. Amenities are good (including Shiseido toiletries). One area of improvement is the breakfast. While not included in the room rate, guests can either go to the western-style cafe by the entrance for a pastry and coffee, or buy a voucher for a Japanese-style breakfast in the basement. We only tried the Japanese breakfast, and felt it was the fly in the ointment. The proteins (pieces of fish, chicken and pork) were overlooked and cold. Items that ran out were not replenished (including a pot of rice porridge that ran out more than an hour before the end of the breakfast service). Having said that, these are certainly things that can be fixed quite easily if management would like to do so. Otherwise, there are plenty of other dining options within a stone's throw.Overall, we still give this property a thumbs up and would consider it again for a future stay.","New York City, New York","djglobetrotting</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",87,4.0

The Yukata that is provided as a robe is also comfortable.

Probably because of the month of our travel (Oct), the air-conditioner is now a heater, so the only way to get the room to cool is to open the window (which only opens a crack).

The hotel is conveniently located in Shinjuku with lots of restaurants and pubs as well as a number of convenient stores next door. Rooms are extremely tiny (probably the tiniest that I've stayed in compared to others in Japan) but was extremely clean with 'help yourself' complimentary amenities (there's a table by the lobby elevator). Best advice as a tourist is to pack light as we struggled to open 2 suit cases inside the narrow room. Bed was ok (although you can tell that the mattress is quite old and saggy) - I think the hotel is currently undergoing renovations. As the location is situated in busy Shinjuku (with the red light district around the corner) I was impressed at how the room was able to keep out the hustle and bustle of city noise. My only criticism is that our floor reeked of cigarette smoke. Even though we were given a non-smoking room, the neighbouring smoking rooms gave off a very strong stench in the hallway. Although an ideal location (the Nishi Shinjuku station is around the corner) we were coming from the Shinjuku JR line and found it very very exhausting dragging our suitcases to the hotel. Not every street corner has a cross-walk and so we had to take longer detours which made a 10 minute walk more like 30 minutes. There's also heavy construction going on near the hotel so it's not the easiest streets to navigate so if you are coming from JR Shinjuku I highly recommend jumping into a taxi which would set you back around 800 yen.

Everything look clean and in good conditions, functioning without any problem. Just 2 issues, first the AC is to wick, not really enough to cool the room (considering that in summer the temperatures in Tokyo are really warm and steamy, is necessary to improve this point) and the other issue is that the WiFi doesn´t work well in all the room (even it is really small we have to be close to the door or at the bathroom to get well connection), we stayed at 2 different rooms at 11th floor having the same problem... of course at the lobby WiFi runs very fast.If you are in a hurry, there is a coffee shop just at the entrance of the hotel to grab something for breakfast, so that is really convenient and there is a 7eleven a few steps from the hotel with a ATM that accepts international debit cards.Near, at Shinjuku you could find plenty of great options to eat and drink, and at night is full of life.

It is only five minutes walk from Shinjuku and the busiest station in the world.. Shinjuku Central Railway Station. Where do I start?? Well to begin with, if it is night-time then you head straight into Shinjuku central, which is the place you see in movies with all of the billboards and lights. If you are after the quiet backstreets of rural Japan stay clear. This is an anthropologists delight with all manner of Bohemian types parading around the maze of streets. The choice of restaurants is almost endless and the psychedelic lights mesmerising. You should wander for a while taking in the sights before you settle in for a meal. There is even a fruit market if you want a vegetarian meal. I am not a big fan of the urban, over-populated city, but this is different; an experience not to be missed.Back at the hotel everything is really nice and comfortable. It is on a busy street so ask for a back room say about 5-6th floor, but don't fuss too much as the street noise is not that bad. Most of the traffic is on foot and I did not hear any trains. If you are in Tokyo for the trip home then you are well placed near the station to get either the train or the transfer coach to the airport. I went down the night before I departed and pre-paid for my ride by coach just outside Shinjuku station. That guaranteed me a seat on the bus for the time I booked. I recommend you do the same.","Surfers Paradise, Australia","williamsN3015EP</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Surfers Paradise, Australia</strong>",147,5.0

Wi fi connection is strong,fast and free..The Bathroom is compact and the bath tub is really small but it has strong water pressure and doesn't run out of hot water.On the front desk are 2 boxes of Lipton Teas of different flavors for guest to take at their pleasure. Also on the lobby beside the elevators is an amenities counter where guest can get their needs for toiletries like body scrub, body sponge, razors and shaving cream and after shave lotions.Check in and out was a breeze. No bellHops to carry your bags though.Located on the hotel front is a St. Marcs Café, across the street from the hotel is a McDonalds. From the hotel door, immediately on your left hand side is a 100 yen store, then a 7-11, then a Lawson convenience store. a few steps further is a temple.On your right hand side is Family Mart, YOSHINOYA (Beef rice bowls among others), a subway station.If you are looking for a place to stay in Tokyo.

And I was not disappointed one bit. In an expensive city like Tokyo, it's not easy to find a hotel that is high on quality and reasonable in pricing. The biggest advantage of this hotel of course is its location. It's less than 10 minutes walk from Shinjuku station, the heart of Tokyo city. The nearest Metro station, though, is Nishi-Shinjuku, which is just 2-3 minutes walk. Transport, food, shopping, nightlife -- the best of everything in Tokyo is at a walking distance from the hotel.I believe the real character of a hotel manifests through all the small things it has to offer. I was particularly impressed by the hotel for two reasons. First, though my check-in time was 3 pm, I landed up there an hour early. They allowed me to check-in immediately without any hassle. Second, I ran out of my phone battery in evening and realized that my charger was not working. I took a walk to the reception looking for a solution. One of the staff members immediately handed over a charger to me. I though he had given that for a few minutes of charging, but was told that I could keep the charger for the night, and for free.My single room was small, yet very cozy and functional. The bathroom too was small, yet quite smartly designed. Had absolutely no problem. And of course, they didn't seem to compromise one bit on cleanliness. Had difficulty in connecting to wifi in the bed, but it was stable and fast near the entrance of the room.Overall, very pleased with the stay.

The information pamphlets at the lobby were very useful. I highly recommend to browse through these maps and information about airport transfer. There are 2 computers for guests to use at the lobby as well.There are convenience stores (7-Eleven & 100-yen store) and many restaurants nearby. A McDonald's (opens 24h) is located just across the street. On the side and back lanes of the hotel, there are many delightful restaurants.

A little bit off the main action of Shinjuku but very quiet neighborhood.+ clean hotel and rooms with a good, budget-friendly and tasty cafe at the ground level+ amenities are readily available+ staff was very friendly, though some could use just a little bit more EnglishCons:- stayed in what they called a single room, which is quite small, but it seems to be the standard in Tokyo. little room for movement, although the bed was a double or queen-size- bed is a little bit on the hard side- could use some English channels on the TV. Every channel was Japanese- i had booked the single room online as there was no other available room. when they found out that i was going to share it with my wife, they essentially gave me the same single room but with added charges. I added about 35,000 yen for the extra person charge for 7 nights. There was some confusion before one of the staff who spoke excellent English explained to me the rules and why they were charging me that amount. I just wish it had been made known to me earlier.All in all, a pleasant stay despite the initial miscommunication regarding the price. I would probably stay here again if given the chance to visit Tokyo in the future, but make the price/room type clear before booking.TIP: it is much easier to take the Airport Limo bus from Narita or Haneda and get off at the Hilton Tokyo. From there, it's about a two block walk to the hotel, past the hospital. Much, much easier than getting off at the very busy Shinjuku station and getting lost, especially if it is your first time.

It is within walking distance (15-20 minutes) to all the action in Shinjuku and tons of shopping/restaurants .The closest metro station is Nishi-Shinjuku which is a short 3 minute walk away (2 short blocks or so) and there is an elevator (this was great considering we had to catch the early morning airport express with our big luggage and was an easy one metro stop to Shinjuku station). For other days, it was also an easy 15 minute walk to the enormous Shinjuku station (for JR lines and airport express). In order to get there, one would walk on the elevated pedestrian walkway to access the station (we used Exit A18 as a point of reference – which was on the east side of Shinjuku station).The hotel is located on the quieter area of Shinjuku and had plenty of dining options. There is a McDonalds across the street, a 7-11 and Family Mart within a block radius. There is also a nice café right by the lobby of the hotel.We stayed in a double room as all the twin rooms were fully booked. The room was clean and on the tighter side, but with two people and luggage, we managed quite alright. The bed was on the firmer side and had a nice cozy down comforter. Slippers, robes, toothbrush/paste, shampoo/conditioner, body wash were provided and extras such as body sponge, makeup remover pads, cotton squares and tips were available by the elevator in the lobby. The bathroom was clean and a good size. The water pressure was excellent.The staff was very helpful and attentive. We asked for directions to several restaurants and maps were immediately printed out for us. We also borrowed an umbrella from the front desk on a rainy day.Overall this was a very pleasant stay.","New York, NY","chill_bee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",23,4.0

Many shops, cafes and restaurants were close by. Upon arrival, the front desk was extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was not as small as we expected as it was well laid out.

I ended up taking the subway into Nishi-shinjuku station, and from there the walk is a breeze (2 minutes).

There is Video On Demand (VOD), but did not use it. Instructions indicated to buy a 1000 yen card (machine dispenser close to elevator, good for all day), there is a vast category selection (movies, kids, anime, hobby, adult entertainment, etc.)Bathroom: Deep bathtub, excellent water pressure and electronic toilet. Unfortunately the toilet paper was very thin.Bed: Hard but comfortable, would suggest to bring your own pillows.Windows: No curtains, there were sliding wood doors. Wish it was darker (as sunrise was around 4:45 AM).Extras: Used the water heater/humidifier only as water heater, Worked fine.There are soft drink/beer vending machines in some floors and a clothing press (rather than an iron).Lobby has (complimentary for guests) tea bags, disposable razors, toothbrush, etc. More options at night time than in the morning.WiFi: No issues. Might be slow, but only used it to check emails.Staff: Was told morning personnel did not speak English, so only talked to the night shift. They were courteous and helpful.Location: Walking distance from Nishi-Shinjuku (M07 in the Marunouchi Line, exit A1 and make a left). Almost in front of the McDonald’s. There are two convenience stores close by (Family Mart and 7-11).Restaurants: There is one pastry restaurant as you exit the hotel (a section of the lobby smells like butter), did not try it. The basement has the fabulous Teke Teke a yakitori izakaya gem. They had a promotion where if you liked them on Facebook you would receive a complimentary beer.There is an elevator for the handicapped, wonder if they have special rooms (as the deep bathtub would complicate things).","Guelph, Canada","Alejandro_B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guelph, Canada</strong>",75,4.0

The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from Shinjuku Train Station, in a relatively quieter area. Positives: I would say the location is excellent as the area is quite quiet at night, as compared to the crazy crowded and noisy Shinjuku area. It is also 2 minutes walk from Nishi-Shinjuku (Marunouchi Line) Metro Station. It is also located right along the main road, so you definitely wont miss the entrance.There is a McDonald's directly opposite the road, and there are Japanese restaurants and a Yoshinoya within a minute's walking distance. Lawson and 7-Eleven are also really nearbyThe staff are able to communicate well in English and are helpful. The room we stayed in was a economy double room, which was clean and well maintained. There was a computer we could use at the lobby to print our travel itinerary with no extra charge.Negatives:The walls between rooms are quite thin, we could hear others' loud arguments through the walls. The housekeeping staff a little too on-the-ball. We were woken at 10AM when they were making their rounds as we didnt put the 'Do Not Disturb' sign outside.But on the whole, had a good experience staying here.","Singapore, Singapore","kianggg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",72,4.0

Very clean hotel, nice lobby, well equipped rooms and helpful staff. Its less than 1/2 mile west from main Shinjuku station but right next to Nishi-Shinjuku station. We actually took Airport Limo Bus to Hilton and then one of their staff pointed us right direction, about 10 minute walk to hotel. For landmarks, it has a green sign and is nearby McDonalds and Shinjuku Police Station with Kinko's almost next door. Convenience stores, 100 yen shop and restaurants all around and great café in lobby with pastry, coffee. The rooms are small, like most on Japan, but well laid out and all amenities, shampoo, soap, body lotions, toothpaste, toothbrush, tea, coffee, etc. and even more amenities in lobby if you require. Mainly Japanese tv channels but they are pretty entertaining with game shows that are funny in any language. Nearby the Nomura Building has several restaurants including Balinese, Belgian Beer Garden, Japanese food and more. P*ss Alley just a little further and busy Kabuki-cho is little further under the freeway overpass. Walking distance to Metropolitan Government Towers and we even walked to Shinjuku Gyoen National Gardens which were beautiful in Cherry Blossom Season. Easy subway to almost anywhere in the city, Nishi-Shinjuku right next to hotel and much easier than the huge busy main Shinjuku station.We found the staff very helpful, always someone who could speak English and they had subway maps and helped us find easiest route to various sights. I think for the price, this hotel is a real bargain in Shinjuku. We would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to be close to the action in Shinjuku.","San Diego, California","SeanSD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",119,4.0

Not perfectly quiet, and a very hard mattress. I dealt to the latter by folding my duvet in half and sleeping between it's softness.Just a couple more things in English would also have been helpful. There was a gadget that I had no idea what to do with, whereas most other things did have English instructions. Oh, and bottled water was a welcome addition for three of my four nights' stay, but I wonder why it was't provided for the first night.However, all of those were just minor irritations for a hotel well placed for Shinjuku's rail station, subway station, Goyen (gardens) innumerable eating and shopping establishments from a room that was perfectly well sized for a single traveller with a large suitcase and a couple of other travel bags. I wasn't impressed with the cafe, but that may have been because I was in a tearing hurry for something suited to my breakfast needs and they didn't have what I wanted, but I did dine in the restaurant one night, and that was good. As with proximity to all the big rail stations, actually sorting out the right exit, and the right way to go is an issue. That's not the hotel's fault, and once you discover the intricacies and secrets of Japan's subterranean world it's not such a biggie to overcome. First time will never, in a million years, equate to google's suggested ""8 minutes* etc.! The nearby police stain gives a sense of security, but it was quite noisy, even with the double glazing, when sirens and or some street noise was exceptionally loud, but I don't believe that's really a major issue, except for exceptionally light sleepers.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","Jqqls</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",94,4.0

I have only seen three hotels, but the others had much more ""useless"" stuff (coffee table) cramped into the same room, probably as this is mandatory to reach a particular number of stars. The staff is helpful but sometimes, it is more trying than doing - in particular, English is a problem - but somehow, you will get it work. They have a small cafe where you can get breakfast in the morning. The location is quite convenient.The point why I rate my stay as ""poor"", is a somewhat unfortunate concatenation of events, plus one MAJOR defect of the hotel itself.The defect is simple to explain: They do not have an AC or heating. And with that I mean: The room is missing any switch where you control what temperature the room should be heated or cooled to. You can only use one dial for the ""AC"" to low, medium or high air flow. In winter time, they send very hot air down these pipes; I put the dial to ""low"", but woke up at 3 am with the room being at about 25 C. I was sweating like hell under my thick winter blanket. So, the ""AC"" better stays off at all times. What is nice is that you can open the windows; that is a clear plus.Now to the concatenation of events: We stayed in Tokyo over the beginning of spring. As Japan has a public holiday on the Friday following the beginning of spring (that is what I understood), Tokyo was packed. Although we booked rather early, we had to book smoking rooms. I smoke myself and I have stayed in two smoking rooms before, so I thought, ""how bad can it be"". I was wrong, very wrong...Second: Japanese people hardly every smoke outside, but rather in their homes or, well, their hotel rooms. Our smoking rooms were the worst I have ever smelled, it was soaked with stink. Even the mattress stank...Now third: No AC. Sleeping in the room without air exchange felt like sleeping with your head in an ashtray.So, I left the window open during the night, all nights. But fourth, Tokyo is a busy city that never sleeps. The traffic was really really loud. If you are lucky, you are on floor 10 and above, and maybe, it is less bad there. From the second night on, I therefore slept with an open window and earplugs (there is a 100 Yen shop very close, where they sell earplugs, hooray).In total: If you get non-smoking room, and you do not have a problem sleeping in a room at some random temperature (whatever comes out of the AC), then this hotel is totally ok. Nothing great, nothing particularly bad. But never ever book a smoker room, unless you are unable to smell anything! ;-)","Berlin, Germany","Sebastian B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>",4,2.0

Just make sure you follow the west exit when arriving from Narita airport on the Narita Express! Like all stations in Tokyo, Shinjuku too is massive and has different exits and access points and if you miss the right one, you'll end up in a totally different area from the one you are after! This said, you can easily walk to the hotel in 5 minutes really! It depends on the road you choose! I' d suggest the one in front of you as you leave the JR station, just face the Cocoon building and go towards it by walking past the bus station and proceed straight on, turn right until you come to the LOVE sculpture, turn right again and you'll come to the Police Station. Now all you need to do is to cross the road to find yourself in front of the hotel! Or there is another option but it'll take you a little longer. As you exit the Station, keep walking on the right as far as the traffic lights, cross the road on your left and cross again on the right then keep your left, walk past the pedestrian bridge and walk until you get to the hotel which is on your right. The hotel met all my expectations: very clean, high tech bathroom with all the toiletries you can think of, right sized room and a comfy queen bed. A kimono and slippers are provided and the free wifi and air conditioning worked perfectly! There is also a mini fridge , a flat screen TV and a boiler if you wish to enjoy typical Japanese green tea! The staff was very kind and helpful as all Japanese people are! Breakfast was not included but in the lobby there is a cafe where you can enjoy a croissant and coffee or cappuccino for about 440¥! Needless to say that Shinjuku is a busy financial and shopping district so there are so many options for food out there not to mention things to see and do!

The hotel is budget friendly but is quite comfortable and really convenient! Most of all, their staff (at the reception) are the friendliest and one of the most helpful i've ever met. And indeed, that's the reason why i even bothered to write my very first review on tripadvisor (yeah, i'm one of the lazy ones who just read and then read some more). I only stayed in Tokyo for 2 nights, the first night i spent in Mt. Fuji summit (which isn't exactly Tokyo). LOL. The second night at Nishitetsu Inn, Shinjuku. The hotel is located very conveniently along the main road a few minutes walk from the busy and quite confusing Shinjuku Station. There are several convenience stores around the area, a McDonald's on the other side of the road, a Cafe at the first floor, and a subway about 2 minutes away. Actually, unless you have a ton of luggage you can skip the subway and just walk along the main road towards Shinjuku Station. Since it's along the road, it's very easy to find - plus the building has an orangey brick-colored design, so it sort of stands out. The room is well maintained, clean and comfortable. It's the typical size for most hotel rooms in Japan which tend to be small but not at all cramped. Of course, i was travelling solo and didn't bring a large luggage - so i found the size quite good. Also, the bathroom is quite nice and roomy. Don't expect any nice view from your window, though. It's surrounded by other buildings, and busy roads. The sound-proofing is quite good though, so i didn't have trouble getting sleep. The reception area is also quite nice, spacious with a bright and airy feel, and well staffed. Speaking of - they have one of the friendliest and most helpful staff i've ever met. They'd always politely greet you with a smile and the check-in/out was smooth and fast. Not all of them can speak English but they seem to always have at least one staff that can and would gladly help you out. I have to give a shout-out to Wada-san whom has helped me a lot during my stay with them. (i seriously hope i got his name right). On my climb to Mt. Fuji i have lost my wallet and he helped A LOT in trying to get it back. He contacted the police, several branches of 7-11, train stations and bus stations. As my Japanese isn't really all that good - he was the one to explain, write down details, hunt down contacts all the while trying to understand my broken Nihongo. Good news is, with the help of another friend of mine in Shinjuku i eventually found my wallet. I didn't get to personally say thank you to Wada-san, though. So, if any of the other staff or admin is reading this please give my utmost, most-heartfelt THANK YOU to Wada-san. I'm giving a 5-star mainly for his help. btw, i booked through booking.com which was really convenient because it doesn't tie you up with a specific credit card (remember my dilemma of losing my wallet containing almost all my credit cards). upon check-in, you can use the same card from booking.com, or use another card or even pay cash. also, the rooms don't have Wi-Fi, only ethernet cable connection but you can always borrow a Wi-Fi router from the reception for FREE. It's very easy to setup (basically just plug it in) and they come with English instructions. Lastly, it's close to the ""LOVE"" sculpture and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building. At night walk along the main road, past Shinjuku station you'd see how bright and active the night-life is in this area of the city.","Singapore, Singapore","mickeymicks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",10,5.0

There was no drinking water in the room and it took three people to explain to me that there were vending machines on the 5th and 10th floor. This could not be explained to me over the phone, I had to go downstairs to get this answer. I would never stay here again. We asked for restaurant recommendations and no one had a clue.

Firstly the location is excellent. It is 2 mins on foot from Nishi-Shinjuku subway station on the red line - a direct line from Tokyo station and the Shinjuku subway/JR interchange. I found this really easy as a base to get around to everywhere I needed to go. Its also a 8 min walk to the airport bus service requiring no trains or stairs etc. If you are using this service to get from the airport to the hotel I suggest you print off a map otherwise it could be slightly confusing the first time but fine with a map/directions. I wouldn't recommend a taxi from the bust stop to the hotel during the day - it’s a very busy area, it’s probably just as quick to walk it. The other great thing about the location is its surrounded by cafes, convenience stores and eateries. I didn't book breakfast with the hotel and really didn't need to because there were numerous options around. It’s also just 5 minutes on foot from the Shinjuku area proper - the department stores, electronic stores and small bars and restaurants. Once you are in this area (just down the road from the hotel) you get a sense of the 'real' Tokyo - tall buildings, lots of neon lights. The hotel itself was extremely good value. I booked a single room expecting it to be tiny. It wasn't. I had a double bed, decent sized room and bathroom (by asia standards). It was very clean and not dated at all. The flow of air was great, never felt stuffy. The rooms include a kettle, dehumidifier, green tea (no coffee but you can get that from the shops next door), a fridge, flat screen, the bathroom had all the regular products plus tooth brush. There were also slippers and a night gown. Because I had a single room there was only 1 pillow when I arrived, however on request they gave me a second and a blanket. All in all the room was really comfortable and I have no complaints. The only standard things missing were a safe and english TV channals. I used the safe at reception which was fine and very easy to do. The last two hotels I'd stayed at in Japan had either no English channal or only one. So at this point I didn't care. The hotel service was great - again no complaints. The front desk staff were super helpful. There is the use of the computers and internet in the reception area for free - a relief after having to pay 1 dollar for 15 mins at another hotel. The lobby area is large and clean. There are plenty of front desk staff so I never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to speak to someone. And whenever I asked for something in my room it came within 5 minutes. Would definitely recommend for solo travellers as I was, a very safe and convenient location to explore Tokyo from plus good size single room.","London, United Kingdom","serenerussian</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",41,5.0

Also, I met lots of other guests in the lobby (using wi-fi) who were travelling throughout JapanThe rooms are very clean and my single room had adequate space. I was located on the 14th floor and opened the window at night so it was nice and cool, also quiet.There's a great Japanese buffet breakfast that's also good value to try at least once.I would most definitely stay here again.","London, United Kingdom","Petra_360_</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",24,4.0

You just drop your card in a box if you are in a hurry and doesn't need to pay anything extra (like rent of a laptop)All the staff we spooked to were friendly and helpful when asking for help or advice. The size of the room was big enough for us 2 with two large suitcases. And it was a good thing to not feel claustrophobic when taking a shower. For us, this was to biggest room so far in Tokyo. The Nishi-Shinjuku subway station is about 2 min from the hotel and it takes about 10-15 min from the big Shinjuku station depending from which exit you go out to.I would recommend the A18 exit at the Shinjuku station if you are not carrying to much luggage and the take the overpass so you go over to the other side of Meiji dori street. Go in a west direction, pass a Lawson convenient store and when you pass the 7/11 store you are about 20 meter from the hotel. Just down the road you will find many café for having a breakfast and Shinjuku is a great place to stay at if you like to shop and eat. Easy access to rest of Tokyo from either Nishi-Shinjuku station or the Shinjuku station. We also liked to have the 7/11 ATM very close so we didn't have to worry about taking out money using a foreign card.I would return to the hotel since it was good value for money, clean room, traffic at night very quite, and the hotel is in a good location in Shinjuku.","Stockholm, Sweden","Wishgiver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",12,5.0

Upon request, they simply stated that they did not have this and gave me a (very complicated) pamphlet over bus-times and pointed towards the nightmarish Shinjuku-station. (I ended up traveling with Narita express, after spending half a day inside Shinjuku-station to learn the way from the subway to the express trains instead)- It can be a little busy with ambulances, because it's located not far from a hostpital, probably depends a little where your room is located.All in all; It's convenient, clean and practical and a good hub, from which you can travel around the city and look around.",Oslo,"znapper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oslo</strong>",36,3.0

It's not spacious like what you would get from the 5,6-star chains, but I consider my double room very reasonably sized.Our room was very clean and the furniture looked very new. We had clean towels, sheets and a very comfortable bed. The pillow was very interesting because it's double layered. One side is soft and other side have some kind of beads in it. Soap, shampoo and conditioner are provided in the bathroom from a pump dispenser. There is a deep bathtub. Shower cap, shower scrub, comb, cotton buds, cleansing oil are provided on a tray by the lift lobby on the ground floor. Slippers and odour spray are also provided in our room.The bathroom has a low ceiling, and one may feel claustrophobic inside, but there is enough space to move around. The toilet bowl is automated.There is Internet connection available in the room but not WIfi. If you have a laptop you will be able to hook up to the Internet via the cable provided in the room. If you're using iPhone, iPad, iTouch, you can try to rent a MyFi device at the airport. It costs 1575 Yen per day for me. The battery life is only about 4 hours max.There is no room service although there is a cafe located by the entrance of the hotel. Coupons for breakfast at this cafe can be found in the drawer in our room but we didn't make use of it because there are many food options in Tokyo.It is abut a 2 minute walk to the Nishi-Shinjuku station which is on the Marunouchi Subway Line and about an 8 minute walk to the main Shinjuku JR Line.If you choose to walk to the Shinjuku JR Line, you will pass by Bic Camera which is a big electronics shop. You also have Keio, Odakyu there, which are big shopping malls. The Airport Limousine will take you to Shinjuku JR Station area from the airport, after which if you take a taxi to this hotel, it will cost 710 Japanese Yen, which is the starting fare. Because cars can only go one way, the taxi will have to make a big round to get to the hotel. So I suggest if you are not carrying a lot of luggage to try to walk there instead.McDonalds is located right across the street and there are several convenience stores located here. 7 Eleven, Lawsons and Natural Lawsons (which stocks organic products) are almost side by side. Some of the staff do not speak much English, but some do, depending on who is on shift. They are very professional and accommodating.","Singapore, Singapore","jollybychance</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",60,4.0
