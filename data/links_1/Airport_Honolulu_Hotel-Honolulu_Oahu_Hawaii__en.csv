He saved my family and I a ton of money and honestly I don't know that we wouldn't even have been able to find a place if it weren't for him. The hotel is clean, the staff is friendly, and the amenities are top notch. Les doesn't sugar coat anything. He tells you how things are in the hotel, and advises you to take care of other things (like laundry) elsewhere since they're expensive in the hotel.I had to take away a star though for the internet. He claims that they have the best wifi of any hotel in Honolulu, but that's like claiming you have the fastest turtle. More and more I see hotels refuse and even remove the wired internet option (the wired option is in this hotel, but disabled) in favor of WiFi.I am an IT security professional, and I have been working with computers my whole life. Rather than bore you with the specifics I will just say that WiFi is awful, and it gets worse the more people are connected to it. You will experience a great many disconnects while connected to the hotel's Internet. It will be basically unusable between the hours of 4-9pm every day, and sometimes around breakfast and lunch time. This would be true of any hotel you go to that has a lot of people and few access points on their WiFi. In my opinion, a single access point per user is the only way to make WiFi bearable -- but if you were going to do that you'd just choose the cheaper option of having wired internet.Also, the WiFi is COMPLETELY UNSECURED. The connect portal doesn't require a password, and just lets you connect. Again, I work in IT security, and it's extremely upsetting to see that any miscreant in the parking lot could see every packet I'm sending on the WiFi. Worse, they could masquerade as an access point for a man in the middle attack.So, tl;dr Les is great, WiFi is awful. Stay here if you're military, but get an unlimited plan on your phone so you can tether. Don't use the WiFi. Seriously. Don't use the WiFi.",United States,"brianhrhodes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United States</strong>",2,4.0

While booking the rooms at different times, my confirmation wasn't completed by the admin. The clerk said it wasn't a problem and that she was adding it to our groups business expense card. Each of us took turns signing in for our rooms. They informed us that they required our personal credit cards for any possible damages. When they got to my card, without permission or notification of anything different, they charged the entire cost of the room to my personal card and then handed me a receipt. It took ten minutes of convincing the clerk that she wasn't supposed to charge me, she hadn't even received permission to charge any dollar amount to my card, and that their refund policy didn't apply to this circumstance. It took our business manager and their manager another 45 minutes to get them to refund my money and put the charge on our business card. The refund took three days to arrive in my account. Those were three of the five days I was in town.My second instance was when I recently was scheduled for training by the state. State covers all the booking and charges for other items, but hotel is left to the individual and reimbursed at a later date. I booked my own stay and within five minutes I was told that the dates were different and that this hotel wasn't on the approved list of hotels for my trips. I called and attempted to cancel within the five minutes of booking and they refused due to the hidden fine print on only this room that said non-refundable. I tried reasoning with the person because this is a state funded trip, I hadn't seen the button on the screen you had to click to see it was non-refundable, the state will not reimburse me for this hotel, and that it was less than five minutes from the time I had booked the room. Again they refused to refund the room, even with over three weeks notice.I am a very patient and calm person under pressure. I have not spoken to them rudely at any point. There is no instance of me acting out of line with them. The first instance was completely their fault and still took over three days to get fixed. The second was a simple error based on their hidden disclaimer. Both times they have been rude and unrelenting without cause.They don't deserve the business of friendly and well natured people.I would recommend finding any place else to stay.

This hotel is very accommodating for TLA. We got free parking and $10 meal vouchers for each family member to use for breakfast at their sister property (with free shuttle) or dinner at the hotel restaurant Willoughby's. Breakfast was typical continental breakfast and Willoughby's had a decent dinner selection, you just have to pay the difference that the vouchers didn't cover. We had excellent servers at Willoughby's, especially Emil. He was quick, attentive, and very pleasant. The rooms are mediocre, but the beds were comfy and had lots of pillows. We had a boxer with us and her kennel took up a lot of space, so we were very cramped together in the room. (I recently found out it was one of the smallest rooms in the hotel.) There were 2 dog park areas, one was big and open with 2 pet bag stations, and the other was small and gated with 1 pet bag station. Both had seating available and were nice. The pool was BEAUTIFUL and the highlight of our stay. We went almost everyday. It was 8 feet deep, so the cannonballs were epic! We had an amazing housekeeper, Marites. She was always so polite, cheerful, and knew us by name. One day she came in on us while we were eating dragonfruit. She asked what day we were leaving so that way she could bring us a cutting from her dragonfruit plant from home so we could have a plant at our new house. She went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable during our stay, The staff at Airport Honolulu Hotel made our 3 week stay a pleasant one all things considered.",,AndreaH010,1,4.0

It's in a good location near the airport if that works for your stay but that's about it. There was ample parking on the side and rear areas of the hotel which you have to pay for. It's not free or included in your stay. We checked in about 4pm and we're assigned to a room on the second floor of this four floor older hotel. As we entered the room we noticed a stale odor. It was a typical room nothing special but comfortable. We got settled then went to get dinner. Upon our return the lot was full with cars also double parked. The hotel was having some type of special event with many non guest attending. So much for pay parking. Fortunately we found a car leaving and took their spot. Trying to go the sleep we had to deal with a noisy AC. Then at about 3am a fire alarm went off with an audio telling everyone to evacuate. Five minutes later we were notified it was a false alarm. As we're trying to go back to sleep, at about 4am the alarm goes off again. No audio, no nothing. So much for a restful sleep. We decided to stay up as we had to leave for the hospital at 5am. Then while attempting to leave the parking lot my validated parking ticket doesn't work to let us out. Calling the front desk they say they don't have any record of us paying for parking. I tell them about my stamped validated parking ticket and paid parking receipt with the reference number and they still can't find any information. They finally let us out and I return two hours later. The hotel front desk apologized for their error and I go back to my room to get a couple hours sleep to make up for the rest I lost. As I'm tying to doze off, a kid in the next room starts pounding the walls and yelling.

Both rooms were clean, but furnished completely differently. One had furinture that looked newer and high end, while the other had dated, lower quality furniture. Both rooms had a small fridge and microwave. Truly, the furniture makes a difference as the newer furniture made a better impression as well as offered more storage in the large dresser and bigger table. Both rooms had tile floors. The outdoor was beautiful, but pretty deep for the little kids. The restaurant had large portions and very tasty food. It opened up to the lush pool area. The staff was very courteous, friendly, and accommodating. The coin operated laundry on the second and third floors had two washers and dryers (on each floor, although one washer was broken during our visit) was convenient, but expensive. There was a dog walking area next to the gated parking lot. The dog area was small, but had green grass and receptacles with bags for dog waste. The hotel offers shuttles to the airport. A McDonald's and Starbucks are within walking distance as well as a few car rental companies. The coffee provided in the room was wonderful, but the cups provided didn't have lids.

Everyone is so happy and smiling all very accommodating!!! I even have favorites that have wiggled their way into our hearts were so sweet to my girls and I. First Les Nishimura, he made the PCSing and transitioning easy for us and without his program for the military this would have not been so easy. He is just what a Family needs. The front desk (there are many but....) these 5 ladies are the one who helped me mostly and were so very lovely. Ren, JC, Rose, Suzie & Kahau.... anytime, anything they were right there and so fun chatting with. The servers at the restaurants: All nice but Donna & Stella stood out & were just amazing; its gets so overwhelming in the restaurant sometimes but no matter under pressure they were so smiling and kind. And what is better to find a fun energetic lady like Sweetly (yes! that is her name maybe because she is so sweet) in the hotel store... she finds a way to make small conversation to let you know your -welcomed- even if you are just getting a bottled water. My girls just adored her. They even started calling some of the ladies Auntie/Tita. The ladies that serviced my room, so hard working & they take direction so well, the greet you genuinely really want to know how you are doing... and do it all with gentleness: Janice, Geraldine & Merly just just top notch and I think I will miss them the most since I interacted with them the most. The Bell/shuttle bus guys too: Alex even tried to speak to me in my own language and Jolo. Such Cool, cool guys!Rustin the houseman, even if he sees you, no matter what he is doing he always stop to ask if you need anything. Very hard working. Even the maintenance guys especially the young funny Kevin, I didn’t even know if he was old enough to even work but definitely know what he is doing!!! Last but not least one of the managers Ashley!!! I have never seen such calmness in chaos during heavy PCS season but she really talks to you on a level that is very reassuring and is very kind and empathic towards a situations that are tough for a family.

A minute later, the agent called and said that the hotel FOUND my reservations and to return.I already resigned to the fact that I didn't have a room, so I had rented a car to catch some sleep along side some road or beach. I made my way to the hotel and when the front desk lady saw me, she apologized and provided me some room keys. She started some banter, but I was neither amused or in the mood. I mentioned that I had a vehicle and wanted to catch a few hours of sleep. She comp'd my parking ($30 value). I caught a few hours of sleep and checked out as soon as possible.I will never return to the place where I was made to feel so bad as a guest. No one should ever be made to feel that way.

I noticed many military personnel staying in the hotel so I assumed value was a key selling point. The pool was small and empty which makes sense since the beach is pretty close. I didn't see any children so vacationing families probably weren't the target audience. The biggest gripe I had was the noise from the military partiers in the parking lot at night. You'd think playing loud music from pickup trucks late at night right outside a hotel window would be frowned upon by hotel staff. You'd be wrong.

The rooms here are clean and comfortable; perfect for business travelers or people on an overnight transit. The fourth floor of the hotel was recently renovated and the rooms are quite nice. I understand that the remainder of the floors are also scheduled for renovation work.If you stay, be sure to check out the hotel restaurant, Willoughbys. Outstanding food quality and service. Western ""comfort"" food with a good menu. Open for breakfast every day and for dinner Tuesdays through Thursdays. There are other dining options within easy walking distance.This hotel caters to the military, and the public areas can seem a bit dorm-like at times, but this is never overly noisy nor troublesome.Be aware that this hotel is a nice, local-style place away from the bustle of Waikiki, but charges ancillary fees that some Waikiki properties might be ashamed of. I am currently paying my room rate, plus a $30/night ""pet friendly"" fee for my Chihuahua, $15/night to park my first car, and another $30/night if I want to park my second car.Overall, a great property if you can afford the room rate and avoid most of the fees.",,James M,0,3.0

The only option was to take a shuttle to their 'sister hotel' (Best Western) for dinner - which was closing at 9pm. This tired soul-less 'restaurant' had the ambience of a noisy bowling alley cafe, and our bland tasteless meals were adorned with near cold vegetables. Blah! And, of course, we had to eat quickly as they were soon to close.But the worst was the absolute stench of stale cigarette smell that permeated the room, and especially the bathroom. Running the noisy airconditioner didn't seem to make any difference to the smell. We rang reception to complain about 11pm, as it seemed to be getting worse, and were advised that someone would come up to check. Instead, they called back a little later and offered to move us to a room in another tower, but we declined as we were in bed and had to be at the airport very early in the morning. All in all, a terribly disappointing end to a glorious holiday. Let's just hope we can explunge the experience at this hotel from our memory banks!",,JennieMac60,1,1.0

I chose this property because it had decent reviews, was close to my home, had very good rates, and, again, would let me bring my dogs.My positive experience with this hotel began with my call to their reservation line. I had originally booked through hotels.com but needed to make a last minute change so I thought it best that I call in. The person I worked with, Jennifer, was phenomenal. She got me the reservation I needed, got me a better rate, and got a waiver for me to bring 3 small dogs when the property has a limit of 2 animals per room. What more could I ask for? Her service was great.When I got to the hotel I was warmly greeted. The front desk staff actually got me lower prices on some of the extras I was paying for like parking. They said they were able to do this because I had called the reservation line and recommended that I always call in rather than book online. Lehua took good care of me and got me into the room early.My room was small but tastefully decorated. I really liked that the air conditioner had been turned on prior to my arrival so that the dogs and I walked into a very comfortable room. The beds were comfortable, there were plenty of drawers to store things in, the WiFi was free and it's performance was reasonable. I liked that the in-room coffee maker used Keurig K-cups. This made it really easy to brew some coffee.I took my dogs for a walk. The hotel has a little dog park with a nice double gate system. My dogs had fun in the little park. It was a great little area for them to get some exercise. I noticed that the park was well-kept. There were bags provided for clean up and people were obviously using them and/or the staff were making sure that the area was kept clean.For dinner that night, my daughter and I decided on something quick and easy. There are many fast food options nearby including McDonalds, IHOP, Dunkin Donuts, Big Kahuna Pizza (a really great place), and others. Willoughby's, the restaurant at the hotel, was not open the night we were there but we did have great breakfasts there the next morning.Parking was plentiful so I never had a problem finding a space. Entrance and exit were via a parking card that you get upon your first entry and have validated at the front desk.

We had a home rented when we arrived and our pets were boarded at the airport for a few days upon our arrival, so we didn't need any hotel pet services when we arrived. (We stayed one night at AHH upon our arrival to Oahu.) But upon leaving Hawaii to go back to the mainland, we were in need of a hotel that would accommodate us and our five pets. We knew AHH was pet friendly but we didn't realize just HOW pet friendly they were! We have one very large dog, a medium sized dog, and three cats. The hotel has a ""pet wing"", which is a relief because most (maybe all, not sure) of the people on this wing have pets. So I don't have to be worried that the people here are being disturbed by my ever-barking Great Pyrenees (though we didn't just let her bark to her heart's content). They also have two ""dog park"" areas, one which is completely fenced in with a double gate. Huge sigh of relief! They both have plastic bags and trash cans for you to pick up after your dogs and dispose of the waste. Also, there is no carpeting in the rooms which is a huge relief for guests with multiple animals! The only downfall for pet owners is that the hotel is VERY near (literally just a few steps) to a very busy highway and if your pet gets loose, he could end up on that highway very quickly and, he's very unlikely to survive the experience.Aside from our pet situation, we had a couple of other issues that arose over the nine days we were at AHH and the hotel went out of their way to help us correct the issues that we caused ourselves. The atmosphere here is very friendly and accommodating and is a great choice for military coming in and out of the island. Would it be ideal for vacationers? Not really because it's in a very unattractive part of town with absolutely no view of anything desirable. Because of the undesirable location (it is, however, walking distance to the airport), the price is probably decent (the Army paid for our accommodations, so I don't even know the nightly rate), so for that (the lower rates, if indeed, they are low for the area), some vacationers might be interested in staying here. Finally, one thing that really floored me is that my husband made the reservation on his own ahead of time, but when we arrived, the front desk said we should have gone through their military liaison. So she canceled our reservations and rebooked them through the military liaison and, by doing that, we ended up with TWO ADJOINING rooms, instead of just one room! Now, this did make us go over our daily allowance from the military and we lost our meal vouchers because of it, but having that extra space with two teenage boys and five pets was a Godsend and was well worth the extra price and loss of meal vouchers. (There are plenty of restaurants around the hotel anyway...within walking distance...for lower-cost eating.)I'm very happy with the AHH. Very happy. In Hawaii, we've been taken advantage of so many times by local companies and it was a breath of fresh air to be treated with the care and kindness we would desire from any company. Thank you AHH! We are very impressed with you! I gave the hotel four stars instead of five only because the hotel is not in the most desirable location, which, of course, you guys can't really control, but vacationers will want to know about that. And also because that highway is so close and it made me very nervous. (We have a couple of escape artist pets.) Please don't take the four stars personally, we were very thankful for you and all your care and courtesy! Your customer service was ten stars!

I saw many people with there pets staying in the hotel as well. It is only about 5 minutes to Hickham Pearl Harbor Joint Base.

It's an airport hotel right off of a major highway in a warehouse district. But... if you are transferring from someplace else and need a night to sleep near the airport, this hotel is just fine. It is less than a mile away, they offer free shuttle service and it even has a small pool, garden and restaurant. But it's a place to transfer, not plant yourself.The rooms themselves are good enough for what it is. The price is a little higher than you might expect to pay but ironically, there are only one or two choices for overnight accommodations right at the Honolulu Airport, and I believe this is the best choice of those options. The main reason for my high marks is because of the service. We actually arrived a day earlier than our intended reservation because I made a mistake during booking. Since I had prepaid (for two rooms), I was now in a situation where I was going to need to purchase rooms for multiple nights when I only needed them for one night. On top of that the hotel was full when we arrived close to midnight with our kids. Suzie, who was working the front desk took care of us. She found us two adjoining rooms in an adjacent building and she even dealt with my travel agent to work out canceling my non-refundable payment for the night that we no longer needed. I was surprised at how helpful they were! That was the first thing that they did. Next, my wife left her jacket by the pool when we went to the airport to check in to our outbound flight. She called the hotel, and they dispatched a shuttle driver to take it to the airport directly to her. It's the little things that make a big difference when you're traveling, and having people that are willing to go a little out of their way to smooth out the rough patches are simply the best. The Airport Honolulu Hotel has those people and for me that means it has to be a top destination for travelers that have a choice. Great people will always tip the balance.","Westport, Connecticut","Bruce H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Westport, Connecticut</strong>",131,4.0

The airport passengers were loaded, sometimes with the suitcases being thrown onboard by the bus driver.

He told us that if we had a morning flight we should take the airport shuttle 3 or 4 hours prior to departure. He expected the shuttle service to be delayed. Surprisingly we checked in without delay.

While it may not seem to be the most posh hotel in Honolulu, it is definitely one of the most friendly, accommodating, and pet and military friendly hotels we've ever stayed at, and we have stayed in hundreds of hotels in the U.S. and Europe.The staff at AHH are definitely the best part of the equation. They were warm and friendly and attentive right from the moment we stepped in the door, even at nearly midnight. The military liaison, Les, goes out of his way to accommodate and meet the needs of military families. We were able to stay in two large rooms with our 2 kids and 90lb dog for the same rate we would have stayed in one room on the military base. The housekeeping staff is incredibly friendly, greeting us warmly even just in passing in the hall. Our housekeeper for the bulk of our stay, Geraldine, was so sweet and kept our rooms absolutely immaculate! We were able to eat breakfast daily at the hotel restaurant, Willoughby's, with little out of pocket expense due to military friendly vouchers, and the food was always delicious. The restaurant staff, Sharon, Robin, Stella, JaNae, Donna, Tim, and John, were always so friendly and seemed sincerely interested in our happiness and comfort. By the time we left they seemed like old friends. The front desk staff were also absolutely wonderful! Even when they were super busy, especially on Tuesday mornings as they worked so diligently to accommodate visiting veterans on medical trips, they cheerfully greeted us and were always super helpful. On our departure, we got lots of hugs and wishes for us to return to visit often. As for the physical accommodations, as I said, AHH may not be the poshest hotel in Honolulu, but it is very nice all the same. Our rooms were large and very convenient to parking, the dog walk area, the laundry facilities, and the gym. The beds and bedding were comfortable enough, and we had mini-fridges, Keurig Coffee makers, and microwaves in both rooms. the hotel gym, while small, was adequate with a treadmill, elliptical, weight machine, and good selection of free weights. The pool and surrounding area was clean and inviting. Parking was another military perk and was comped for both our cars, and there was usually ample parking. On the handful of nights when the lot was over full, there was free valet parking.Finally, my reason for the four star rating in lieu of five stars, was simply the noise. Our rooms, being on the outter side of the east building, were next to a noisy rental car park which got very noisy at various hours of day and night. Also, the hotel is right next to Nimitz Hwy which is under Hwy 1, and so the traffic noise is a bit much. I'm not sure if this was just due to the location of our rooms, but I can't imagine it being much better in any other part of the hotel. That said, the location is very convenient to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, the airport (obviously), and major bus lines.I highly recommend Airport Honolulu Hotel to anyone coming to Oahu on military orders, for other business purposes, or even on holiday.

It is so convenient for a quick stop between flights. The shuttle to and from the terminals is excellent. Check in was quick and the lobby is welcoming. There is an onsite convenience store for those essentials. There is easy access (4-5 mins walk) to a nearby row of stores with several fast food outlets. If you choose to eat at the hotel restaurant (Willoughbys) keep in mind that it is not open every night. On the nights it is closed, there is a free frequent shuttle to the hotel's nearby sister property with a restaurant. Willoughbys is open every morning for breakfast. The room is a little dated, but everything works, the shower delivered good pressure hot water, the tv had about 80 channels, and most importantly the room was very clean. The bed was comfortable enough to get some quality sleep. The only downside is the large in-room air conditioning unit that needs to stay running to stop the room becoming a sauna - but this can actually be a blessing, as the white noise from the air con deadens the noise from departing aircraft nearby. The staff were also very friendly and helpful.My only gripe was the lack of staff in the morning, and lack of an express check out option. I went to the lobby at 945am to check out, hoping to get the 10am courtesy shuttle to the terminal. There was only 2 people in front of me (1 being served and 1 queued). The one being served was having issues, as they were on their cell phone and the staff member kept ducking out to the office behind the check in counter. After about 12 minutes they moved on and the next person stepped up. That person then also too appeared to have an issue checking in as the staff member was tapping and clicking at the computer with a bewildered look. At 959am I had to excuse myself and interrupt and say that I have to just leave the room keys and go. They advised that it was fine as long as I don't need a receipt. It would be so much easier if the hotel had an express check out option, where you can leave the keys in the room or at reception and have any charges billed to you and the receipt emailled to you. Most other hotels I have stayed at all had this option. It would be great here, and the majority of guests checking out from an airport hotel have planes to catch. As I said, this was my only gripe and it is very minor. I will certainly stay at this hotel again next time I fly out of Honolulu.

There is a sister property one block away that had excellent lunch and a few small places such as Subway within walking distance.

When we arrived and collected our luggage, we called for the airport shuttle and were told to walk a few doors down and it would be on it's way. After walking to the curbside and waiting for twenty minutes, I called back to the hotel to see what schedule was for the shuttle. The friendly dispatcher said--'a 5 to-20 minute wait' Since we had already waited twenty minutes, we figured it must be any moment until the shuttle arrived. Wrong. After another twenty or so minutes we gave up and started to look for a cab for the extremely short distance to the hotel. Sure enough, when we were marching towards the cab stand, the shuttle arrived-- over a 40 minute wait. The ride is short to the hotel and once at the hotel, I saw signs that the shuttle runs on the half hour. I don't know whey we weren't told that when we called for pickup. Perhaps we just missed one when we had to wait, but even if, it shouldn't have been so long. Once we finally got to checkin, the front desk staff were sweet and slow.

The lady at the front desk said that they would be polishing the floors in the lobby for the next couple of ours. Therefore it was not possible to use the computer in the lobby. I wasn't offered any other opportunity to print two boarding passes.Terrible customer service!!We originally had a second reservation on Aug, 1 before our flight back to Europe.I cancelled it a week in advanced because I found much better hotels close to Waikiki Beach for the same price. The charged my credit card anyway. After calling, they acknowledged their mistake but since I called after hours bookkeeping staff was not there to help me. Front desk told me they would take care of it. Nothing has happened so far.Another example of their terrible customer service.Would never return there. Would not recommend to anybody.You get so much more for your money when you stay close to Waikiki Beach. Its only a 15 minute car ride.

Which for people that are probably only staying for a night before a flight out in the morning is fine.  You cannot drink the tap water or use it to make tea or coffee it was disgusting.  There was no room service but there is a small shop downstairs that had some essentials in which was convenient.  We were on the second floor facing a car park. Be warned car alarms go off all night long.  They also allow dogs in the rooms! I didnt hear it barking but i was wary of what might have been on the carpets in our room. That did put me off and im not sure if i would stay there again for that reason.","Perth, Australia","Kate B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",93,4.0

The location as it is next to the airport. The free and regular shuttle service to the airport.

You are given a list of take away places from a centre down the road. Dinner at the hotel is only available 3 nights a week. The other 4 days it is available from their sister hotel and they offer a shuttle service to it. When it is available it is only till 9PM. There is no room service at all, so if you flight comes in a bit later it is very difficult to get a satisfying meal.You have a microwave oven in the room to heat up some tit bits from the shop at the hotel. They have paper cups for coffee, but very few supplies of coffee and sugar. We could not get a kettle to boil water to make a cup of tea and I was told to boil a paper cup in the microwave. I asked for a couple of glasses so we could have a drink and I was told they don't supply those. There is no bar in the hotel.There was TV but no movie channels.

I must say it was a better experience than I thought it was going to be. The service was average, you have to remember in Hawaii that most people take their time doing things. The front desk people seemed to be always working on something on the computer. Sometimes they wouldn't look up for a long time. Even after saying ""excuse me"" they would be slow to respond. However they were very nice when helping. CThe staff in the restaurant was exceptional even though their prices were not. I was very pleased with the service and they attended to all of my requests quickly. The prices of the food was a big drawback for me. One of their specials was three mini chili dogs with a side of tater tots for $12.95. A little steep for a cheap hot dogs and tots. Especially since there is a McDonalds less than a block away with reasonable prices for similar fare. Additionally, it is open every day for breakfast, no lunch, and only a few days a week for dinner. B-The cleanliness of the room was very good and the cleaning staff was friendly and attentive. I often asked for additional things like coffee or towels and they went out of their way to help. AThe room was equipped with a flat screen that included quite a few channels and of course the normal movie selections. The bed was comfortable and I slept really well. I was surprised at how nice the pillows were, they didn't seem like some cheap off brand. The bathroom had granite counters and the water pressure was good. The furniture in the room had an early 80's white pastel feel but I found was the norm for Hawaii and tropical hotels. I also had a coffee pot, microwave, and a mini fridge. The fridge was perfect for when you had left overs from the high priced restaurant and didn't want to pay for another dinner. Overall I was comfortable in the room. B-The hotel had a small fitness facility with a treadmill, elliptical and a weight machine. Ample for a quick workout but not for the serious fitness guru. Additionally, the pool area was really nice, though it closed at sundown. I guess that is good if you want to relax and not be bothered with screaming kids from the pool area after dark. B+Finally I would be remiss if I didn't comment on the location. It he hotel is literally a block from the airport. So if you are staying here to enjoy Waikiki you may want to look elsewhere because it is a little drive from the main activities. If you want to be close to the military facilities though it seems pretty close. COverall this is a good hotel with average amenities. I would have liked a lounge or somewhere to get dinner through the week but none the less a nice place to rest your head.

I have so many mixed feelings about this place. I'll do a list of pros and cons.Pros:Every staff member I had contact with was superb. 5 stars for those lovely people. Top notch customer service and hospitality; I was so impressed. When I had a scheduling issue regarding placement of my luggage, the staff helped resolve my issue.This hotel is in a very convenient location. Since this was not a leisure trip, there were morning commutes that would have been miserable if staying in Waikiki. Cons: MOLD! Black mold in the lobby lounge can be seen in the ceiling. Our room smelled horrible and upon further inspection, our AC unit was riddled with chunks of multi colored mold. My husband and I got so sick and it took us a while after we left to recover. Staff was extremely apologetic and offered to move us to another room, but that AC was also moldy, so they replaced the AC unit in our room with a clean one. We were already sick, though. The carpet smells awful and will leave your socks black. Disgusting. They have a roach problem. We couldn't keep any leftovers in the fridge because roaches would get in the food. Yes, Hawaii is tropical, yes you will see bugs here and there...but this amount of roaches is unacceptable. I now have a home here and have only seen one roach(and also clean dilligently to prevent mold/mildew in my home.) We didn't have roach or mold problems in the hotel we stayed prior to this one(we only left because the first hotel closed for a remodel.) The parking lot gets so full some evenings, you have to just sit and wait for someone to leave. One night I got so fed up and parked at the end of a row in a spot that wasn't actually a parking space. Thank goodness I didn't get towed. When leaving the parking lot, sometimes the gate malfunctions and you can't leave. This really sucks if you have to go to work in the morning. One day the security guard had to physically lift the gate so I could get out. The meal vouchers aren't as good a deal as they sound if you use them at their sister hotel's(Best Western) restaurant. The food is so bad there for dinnertime we didn't even bother to use our meal vouchers on subsequent nights and just paid out of pocket elsewhere. We weren't able to utilize the restaurant at the Airport hotel in the mornings for breakfast because they didn't open early enough. For someone on vacation this isn't an issue, but for someone who needs to get to work, spending 45min-1 hour for breakfast isnt possible with the nature of Oahu traffic. When we finally were able to eat there for breakfast on Saturday, it was good and we had breakfast there again on Sunday. This hotel needs a serious overhaul, mold cleaning, and extermination.

Housekeeping staff very prompt, professional, and made sure our needs were met. If you're in the military and need a place to stay, I would recommend this hotel as they have people on staff whose sole job is to make sure everything stays within the TLA guidelines.

But for the price per night, we could have stayed at numerous other hotels that would have been nicer. They DO allow pets, which was why we stayed here (we have a kitty), but not sure why the pet deposit is so high if we would just be put into a room with tile that can't be ruined and they want you to carrier your animal each time the maids come. I wasn't really willing to do that, so between that and both of us getting sick, we didn't utilize the maids for much more than new sheets that we changed ourselves, towels and supplies as needed. I will say that the housekeeping staff was actually the highlight of the stay. They were friendly and engaging, efficient and unobtrusive. When we needed to borrow something, they were quick to help. Otherwise, $30 a night to park on top of your stay, our hot water on our sink was broken when we got there, so after a long day we had to wait for the maintenance staff to come in and fix it while we sat there, the batteries died in our TV remote...they had to put in a work order to change them (and we had batteries but couldn't put ours in there because they are screwed in...I guess people steal batteries?) and they NEVER got changed the whole time we were there, the restaurant was pretty gross for breakfast (husband got a stomach ache and I boxed mine and then didn't eat it later), our ""do not disturb"" sign was either stolen 3 times (there weren't enough for every room it seemed) or the staff took them, which is even weirder, and we were next to the LOUDEST, most obnoxious couple and their two kids, that spent their days (and I mean ENTIRE days) screaming at each other...the mother cussing and yelling, the kids screaming and crying and throwing tantrums...and because they had two rooms across the hall from each other, they spent a lot of that time yelling IN THE HALL. No staff EVER stopped it, and I know they were aware (I watched it happen numerous times around staff and other guests), the wifi was HORRIBLE and we couldn't run anything but one of our laptops from it (out of 3 laptops, a tablet and 2 phones) so I couldn't catch up on work or watch anything from Netflix or Hulu or YouTube or anything. I feel like I could go on and on...but you get the idea. The other positive was it's proximity to the airport and having a shuttle...but that was it for me. Wouldn't stay again and wouldn't recommend.

I make this a point as this is the key reason as to why I am recommending this hotel. Its support of military members and their families is seriously unmatched by an commercial non government hotel out there. The military rep, Les, hosts a TLA brief that explains everything you must do to maintain TLA status. They offer other services such as free parking (not something easy to find on island) or vouchers for meals that help to discount the price of food. Add those things with the friendly staff and you get what I call quality service unmatched by even some 4 star hotels in honolulu.I know what you are thinking; ""It is near the airport so there must be airplane sounds throughout the day!"". Despite this concern we only heard airplanes 4 times out of the 40 days we were here, woops actually 5 (one just went over as I was typing this). This was surprising so either the airport is lacking in business or they have created some form of stealth noise system! (just kidding) Whatever it is you don't hear them often enough to be a concern.The location is close to Pearl Harbor and the NEX so even if you do not have a car when you arrive you can easily walk 20 minutes to get to where you need to go to get processing done. The island has a rather robust BUS system that can be tracked via TheBus app on all android and iphones. We found ourselves using this every day until our vehicle arrived. It would be wise to use google to find the routes and then check the BUS times with the app. HINT! There is three bus stops just outside of the hotel that take you to all places on the island.As for the staff we were greeted by a friendly person named Marilou who explained to us the TLA process for the hotel and introduced us to Les. Within a few moments we had keys to our room and were placed on the third floor for easy access to the laundry facility. My only complaint here is that the facility is fairly expensive for laundry, but everything on this island is more expensive. Three dollars for a one dollar burger at burger king was a real shocker, but I digress. Our cleaning lady Norma was very friendly and accommodated our schedule. If we asked her to clean later in the day she would, and if we needed her to clean before we went out she would. We had several thousands of dollars in electronics in the room (laptop, goPro, and cameras) and nothing went missing. This speaks volumes to the integrity of the staff. I have been in places before where you would not even dream of leaving out a camera much less something of real value.You will not find the best views on the island at this hotel, but you will get a great deal and have your family taken care of. I would trade in great view for quality of life any day of the week.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Sean F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",3,4.0

It is not an attractive locale, in that a noisy double deck freeway runs right next to the few hotels. So you only stay here if you need to be near the airport, or near the Kaiser Hospital. For a few dollars more, you can stay in Waikiki.Hotels in Honolulu are pricey for what you get, and the airport hotels are no exception.

We would not arrive until 3:00 AM and really needed rest for our 16 month old daughter. We got to the hotel and found that instead of a king sized bed we had two doubles and no crib. The girl at the front desk said, ""I see that you reserved a crib, but there is not one in the room and their is no one in housekeeping right now."" So in other words, she thought that we would just figure something else out. We insisted she figure out a way to get us a crib and finally someone from security was able to get us one. No king sized beds were available though. The next time through I reserved the exact same thing. This time though I called the day before and told the person that answered how important it was that I have a crib in the room. We show up and, you guessed it, two double beds and no crib. It took around 20 minutes to get us a crib and we were just out of luck on the bed size. My thing is if you aren't going to hold a king sized bed for those that reserve it, why even offer one? Why not just say, ""Reserve a room, we'll decide what kind of bed you get when you arrive."" The worst thing is they basically have no competition since the only other airport hotel is owned by the same company.

But no matter what time of day it is, this man will bend over backwards to contact you and once you are here, he will do the same to help you with anything.Most importantly, what made this almost 2 month stay at the hotel perfect was the staff. From day one, we knew this was going to be awesome. Not sure of her name but the young lady that drove the shuttle bus was super tiny but don't let the size fool you. She greeted us with a wonderful smile and proceeded to lift our luggage in beast mode! Mrs K and Mrs. Ann worked the front desk and they were always so nice and helpful. From recommending places to go, how to get there, ways to save money here and making sure we ended up in convenient rooms.This is where I get teary eyed. Rofel was the lady that maintained our rooms. She not only kept our room immaculate but made our rooms feel like home. By the 3rd day she immediately picked up on how our daughter slept. When she walked into her room, the bed had been made with her own sponge bob blankets, pillows and extra blanket. She treated us like her daughters and I looked forward to seeing her everyday. The day she was not on our floor I was sad but she said ""Janice is there and just as lovely"". She was right. Janice greeted us with the same smile and she automatically felt like my sister. There is also a young man named Richard. I needed help one day and much like the ladies on our floor, he went out of his way to help and he did it with a warm smile. The hotel also provides you with vouchers to eat at their diner. Although we only ate breakfast there, mostly due to it being quite pricey, the proportions are huge! The cook, in which I've never met, puts his heart in every single dish he prepares. To top it off the waitresses are amazing. They all take their time to learn your habits and likes/dislikes. Mrs Robin, Sharon, Tes, Donna and Tim love their customers and have the warmest smiles. My only constructive criticism would be to find a better system for the parking. The vale parking and redoing the parking spaces are a great start but it's still quite frustrating, especially on the weekend. The taxis also have designated spots in which I believe not only takes up needed space but they park in an awkward way and in undesignated spaces that make it difficult to get by. Besides that, mahalo for making us feel like family and I plan on returning to visit!!!Rehina and Victor Lee",,Rehina L,2,5.0

First, the entire building, including rooms, is in need of a deep cleaning as our feet and socks turned completely black after walking on the room's carpet. There is not enough room for parking and all the cars kept blocking the passage for lack of parking space. I was late at work twice because of this problem and had already discussed this issue with the management. The most ridicolous and absurd thing came from the security guard who knocked at my door asking me to take away my swimsuits from the balcony because ""it was not allowed"". Now, I have been staying at Outrigger Waikiki Beach Hotel, a four-star resort, hanging my clean, washed swimsuit over the balcony and no one ever complained about that. Here, in a two-star motel facing a noisy highway and nothing else, I received an absurd request to move my swimsuits because ""it is not allowed"". Well, they should provide a hanging line in the bathtub or at least one miserable chair outside the balcony to allow guests to dry their things. If it wasn't for my son's school district requesting to reside in the commuting area we would still staying at Outrigger Waikiki. I give it two stars for the courtesy and niceness of Teresita, the maid, who seems to have nothing to do with all this surrounding misery.","Honolulu, Hawaii","510danteb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",8,2.0

After calling around to several places I was directed to Les, who is the Military Liaison for this hotel and one other close by. I did not know what to expect, but I have to tell you that after staying here for 6 weeks, I would not have stayed anywhere else. Not only is Les's team great, the entire staff here is great. The front desk takes care of your TLA paperwork perfectly, they know you by name, can answer all questions, and you can tell that they truly enjoy their job. The room service is incredible, which is why I try to leave them some cash as frequently as possible. The wait staff in the hotel are very pleasant and the food comes out quickly and tastes great. Overall, I can't thank this entire hotel enough, they have been great. Lastly, they let my dog stay here for free after she was released from quarantine, they provided a meal voucher when I did not have the dog, and the parking was free. If you are PCSing to the island or if you are just another traveler, please don't rule this place out. It's clean, has a great location, and the staff will take care of you.

Around the corner is a Starbucks, Korean BBQ, Jamba Juice, a Ninja Sushi, and a 500 ft a bar/diner, Lisa's, with one of the greatest English muffin mini pizzas. The base is 1.3 miles to Hickam, 1.5 to Pearl for those PCS'ing. Postal office is around corner to ship gifts. There is a bus stop right outside the front door to catch bus 19 for Waikiki, which runs seemingly all day, non-stop. Rentals can get expensive the bus is a good way to transport kids to the beach for 2.50ea for all day, keep your paper ticket. Now if you feel like taking a car to explore the island the hotel has many rentals 5minutes away.Walking up to the front don't get put off by the freeway, the noise can't be heard from within the rooms and if your like me you will be out most of the day exploring. Parking lots are safe, they have security walking it often, but that doesn't mean to leave your valuables in the car. Lobby is excellent, quiet. For snakes a little shop with food and small gifts are available from dawn past dusk. There is a choice on dining as well. I have yet to eat dinner here but the breakfast is most excellent. So, compliments to the chef! My croissant sandwich never failed a start of a good day. If you can take a seat on the balcony and enjoy the breeze and watching the pool and sometimes kids. The service was great, always full of smiles. Every day I received a wonderful greeting from Sharon who seated me, Jeanne, Robin, and Stella with excellent service. Good day starts off with a cup of Joe and smiles, right? Thank you ladies. The rooms are average looking, like many other rooms I stayed in but I does the job, and my wallet isn't screaming. Sheets are light, and if you need an extra blanket front desk will send one up. AC does the job, kept it running through the night. Due to the tropics there are sometimes bugs, not often. Usually due to food left out and possibly ants. Having AC on helps. If there are issues the staff will help you in any way and possibly change your room. I stayed here for 2 months, and only saw 3 ants. So, it will be pretty slim running into issues with bugs.The maids are wonderful, they will greet you in the hallway anytime. There is one that stuck out, Angie. Wonderful woman, always a smile on her face and would ask if I needed anything, every morning I could expect to see her in the hall. Thank you Angie for cleaning up after me. I'm not a messy person but she was so thorough with cleaning. Well, I could possibly write more but I think I will spare you the rest, and allow you to form your own opinion. For someone simple like me who is out most of the time I give you all above excellent!

The hotel would get 5 stars for any normal traveler, but for any military personnel PCS'ing in particular, this place is the bees knees and would get 6 stars, had they offered it on trip advisor. The military liaisons do a great job of making the transition easy and the hotel bends over backwards to accommodate those personnel coming or going to the islands. The location is prime and is a short drive to any location on the island. The hotel staff are knowledgeable and extremely helpful. The staff at the front desk are particularly well versed in the PCS and TLA procedures. My experience with Rose was outstanding. I wish all hotel front desk staff were as helpful as her. The room service is challenged with a wide variety of situations with families in transition, but go above and beyond the call of duty to make our stay comfortable and they are great at what they do.

They were glad to do it, put our luggage in a locked closet, each bag tagged, and gave us a receipt. We finished the Memorial before noon, and weren't sure how to get back to the hotel, so we called the hotel and they told us which bus to take and where to get off (the bus stop is literally in front of the hotel). Then, when we arrived, they had a room ready for us, even though their official check-in time was still 2 hours away. As we walked down the hall, everyone on the housekeeping staff smiled and greeted us. The room was clean. The free wifi worked great. So did the air conditioning (I mention this because some Hawaii hotels don't have air conditioning). The pool was nice and clean, as were the other common areas and the restaurant. Although they only advertise a free shuttle to the airport on the hour and half-hour, the driver took us as soon as we were ready. And he took another couple, at their request, to some other nearby destination (not the airport), no charge. If you want a glitzy hotel with an ocean view, go to Waikiki Beach and pay $400 a night.

Was very pleasantly surprised. The hotel looks a little tired from the outside, but when we walked into the reception area our first impression was how clean it was. The staff at reception were very friendly and efficient. We had a room on the 3rd floor that overlooked the freeway, but once again the room was very clean. This hotel doesn't have a bar, but we had drinks of our own down in the lounge area, enjoyed a swim in the pool and dinner at the hotel restaurant. The restaurant is only open on certain nights from 5 to 9, can't remember which nights, we were there on a Tuesday night. The menu is not a large one, but we found something for everyone and we all enjoyed the meal. The restaurant only sells wine and beer, so if you are a spirits drinker you would need to take your own. We also had breakfast at the restaurant the next morning (restaurant opens at 6.30am for breakfast) once again a good meal, before hopping on the free shuttle bus to the airport. Obviously this hotel is not a place to stay for anymore than a couple of nights, other than Pearl Harbour being close there is nothing else around the area, except for a few take away shops and a Starbucks. You can catch The Bus, which takes you into Waikiki and Pearl Harbour, trip to Waikiki takes about 45 minutes and costs $2.50. Not sure how long the trip to Pearl Harbour is, cost is also $2.50. Would definitely recommend this hotel for a short stay.","Beenleigh, Australia","Jase53</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beenleigh, Australia</strong>",68,4.0

The hotel provides free transfers from the airport baggage claim areas but you must call for a pickup either through you own mobile phone or call from one of the exits from baggage claim where there is a listing of hotels and direct phones. If you have little baggage, it is a five minute walk to the hotel from International arrivals though the route to get there is not obvious through the maze of roads from the arrival area. One of the great things offered by the hotel is free WiFi in the rooms that is actually pretty good. The restaurant is above average and there is a room designated as a fitness center with typical hotel type equipment. Coin operated washers and dryers are readily available and the room I had (standard) included an ironing board and iron as well as small refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker (not instant coffee but brewed!). While the room rate is not cheap, by the time you take a taxi to a downtown hotel you will have spent more than the difference in room rate. It is also quite close to the Pearl Harbor memorial and the USS Missouri, a huge battleship from WWII, Korean War and Vietnam eras that is now essentially a museum. The hotel is a 20 minute walk from a couple of small shopping centers and a $2.50 bus ride to famous Ala Moana shopping mall and Waikiki beaches. Easy to book online. Note, however, that if you arrive before 3pm (!!), you will be charged a substantial additional day rate so make sure you are prepared for that, I was not and had to come up with an extra $150. They will store your bags if you arrive before 3pm and want to tour a bit before checking in though.","Kansas City, USA","Sunnyguy61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kansas City, USA</strong>",156,4.0

The hotel was very responsive and sent the mini bus immediately. Other than that thus hotel is pretty basic,as is the service, but we didn't mind as we only needed a few hours sleep before our next flight. They only seem to offer double beds which was a bit of a squeeze,especially with our 2 teenagers sharing a bed, and the air con was old and rattled a lot. The room itself was dated and tired looking. The restaurant closes at 9pm and is only open alternate nights which is interesting given that it's billed as an airport hotel.

After a long flight, we weren't interested in these options.Fortunately, there was a small mini mart within the hotel so we managed to get something for our starving teenager. The rest of us went without.

I was put in the building behind the main building which didn't seem to have any security at all; the main doors were constantly propped open and the lift did not require you to scan a room card to access guest floors, despite signs saying it did. As a young female travelling alone, I was not impressed with the lack of security on arrival. Additionally, I was then told that I would have to travel to a different hotel to get something to eat! Not to worry, I thought, if I go nice and early I will be safe. I took the shuttle to the sister hotel for dinner, where I was seated at a table that was already occupied!!! Apparently it is ok to seat someone dining alone at the same table as a couple dining together? At least that couple was lovely to me.I went back to the hotel feeling both uncomfortable and unsafe as I walked alone through the dark car park to the building my room was located in. Went to bed, only to be woken by 'housekeeping' banging on my door at 10.30pm. Why on earth would housekeeping knock at 10.30pm?? If you think that's bad, they knocked AGAIN at a quarter to 1! Needless to say, I did not answer the door, but lay awake for most of the night.There are two things potentially wrong here:Number 1: if in fact it was housekeeping who was banging on my door at this time of night, perhaps the staff need better training. Aside from fire, I really can't understand what wouldn't be able to wait until morning to bang on my door about.Number 2: if it was someone pretending to be housekeeping knocking, then the security of the building really, really needs to be looked at.I will never, ever stay here again. I have travelled alone hundreds of times for work, and I have never felt so unsafe in my life. And please don't tell me that I should have rung reception and requested a different room; I shouldn't have HAD to. Simple as that. My advice to other travellers is if you absolutely HAVE to stay here, request to stay in the main building. I would hope that the security would be better there, though I'm not certain.","Sydney, Australia","Pancakesandbacon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",0,2.0

We had to stay due to our flight being cancelled and Air New Zealand had to accommodate all of us in a hotel for a potentially 12 hour stay while they fixed the plane. We now have had the curious experience at the end of a vacation of being told our flight was delayed five hours, then boarded at 3.15 AM then off the plane and shuttled to this ""hotel"" . We got checked into our room at 6 AM . The things you notice even at that hour of the morning when you haven't slept ? First impression was the smell of old musty and dank in the room.Bugs in the toilet ( lid was closed so they couldn't escape!) sand on the floor( we are NOT adjacent to a beach), sand in the cubby where the towel was stored, and dead bugs all over the floor under the wash stand. So we try to get some sleep. But the air con would be a problem. No matter! The freeway noise would cancel the air con noise out!! We are in the block at the end of the complex,outside and across the walk from the main building. Maybe it would be better in that building? I'm being kind, dear traveller. Don't stay unless you have to like we did. As our flight was rescheduled we had the opportunity to stay another night! Joy of joys. So we order dinner. A starter each followed by a main course. You guessed it. It was a starter followed immediately by the main course which we had only just received. My husband had soup as his starter but it was cold so asked for it to be microwaved ( see not fussy, just want warm food) so the waitress took it way and as our mains were already on the table we were all a bit perplexed about the order of things. Our waitress implied it was a management issue so my husband asked her to send the manager to us so we could convey our thoughts. Didn't happen. Soup returned to the table and my husband was offered dessert by way of compensation. Now you might be thinking we are hard to please. But this place is a shocker. We finished our meal and I had some wine left in my glass. I thought we could take it to the sitting area ( no bar) after the meal. The charming hostess said I couldn't take the glass away from the dining area so I said I was going to the sitting are. Apparently this was ok. Guess what? I defiantly returned to my room with it! Before doing so I went to reception to convey the details of the state of the room. She started by saying we should complain this morning. Now remember,we only got here at 6 am, so that wasn't going to be acceptable. And secondly, where does it say that if your room is dirty due to sloppy housekeeping,that there is a limit on when you can complain? Really if you have to stay near the airport, there has to be a better option than this.look I could go on but I note two things in the reviews of this place. If you write a bad review, Brent apologises for your experience. Hey Brent. Sort it out before you put people in the room so they don't have to moan on trip advisor! Second is that some folk are so pleased to be close to the airport they will accept anything. It's a 40 dollar ride from Waikiki to the airport by taxi cab so you might take that into account before planning your stay here.

No thanks, enough of the shuttle waiting. After getting my thoughts on that off my chest at reception and retrieving the key, as an aside the receptionist mentioned that there was a shop open within the hotel and we could buy microwaveable meals there. OK, well that would have worked except they sell 2 minute noodles but....there's no kettle in the room. Ignoring the noodle warning NOT to use the microwave to heat, we managed to scrape something of a meal together. And then settled in to a night full of partying next door, and the door next to that...and that. I gather a few military personnel were making the most of a get together. Anyhow, when I turned on the light to read, I noticed a couple of cockroaches on the bedside table were enjoying the music from next door. Hey, it's all just another travel experience....except this one cost us more than our nightly rate at the Hilton Hotel Waikoloa which was like comparing apples with shoes.

So, I took the 4:30am shuttle and had more than enough time to spare. I might have even been able to take the 5am shuttle, but that would have cut it close and not fallen within the recommendations of when to get to the airport for TSA, etc.Also, please note that there is a little strip mall of food shops, including gourmet pan pizzas about a block or so away.

It was nice to be able to make a cup of tea in my room at 3:30am and it was nice to keep my bottle of water chilled during the day/evening. Coffee-maker and fresh coffee was included as well. Basic amenities were available in the room as well: lotion, shampoo, conditioner, iron, ironing board, etc. I didn't use the pool, but soon after my check-in in the afternoon, the pool filled up with families enjoying one last night of vacation. The pool was clean from my window view and there appeared to be a handicapped accessible device at the side of the pool as well. The restaurant didn't open up till 6:30am, I think, but there was a gift shop that opened up at 5, I think. The gift shop, which was in the far side of the lobby, had snacks for all different meals, including microwaveable food items. And, as I said, just a block out the back of the hotel was an entire array of food shops.I had read all the awful reviews and called the manager prior to my arrival. He made it a point to greet me soon after my arrival. The staff were cordial, friendly and professional, regardless of whether I had mentioned trying to meet the manager.Probably, the only thing, I didn't care for was the price tag, but the hotel is less than 5 min away from the airport.

If it wasn't for the meal vouchers and the fact that we have housing in the next week we would have moved a while ago. The park is over crowded, MOST of the staff is pleasant, but a few of them are very very very rude. When you check in (military) they say they take care of getting the certificate of non-availibilty for you, however, ours never got one so we have to fight that battle. Then when we paid for our first 10 days, we were over charged. Eventually it was all fixed, but it was still the hassle of having to deal with the mix up in the first place.The restaurant in the hotel, is well mediocre to be nice. The staff while pleasant (most the time) is soooo slow. We average 10-20 minutes before having our drink orders taken. The food is okay, most days, but nothing to drive for. If it wasn't located down stairs from us we would never eat there. In addition, the prices are way over priced. Milk for a child is $4. I understand that it is Hawaii, and things are more expensive but for $1.50 more I could buy a gallon of milk, just saying. I am soooooooooo ready to not be staying in this hotel anymore, and I will definitely not recommend it to anyone else.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Sarah D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",0,1.0

It was so loud I needed to come out and turn it off in order to try and sleep however in addition the air-conditioning unit in my room was so noisy it was a choice whether I could not sleep because it was airless and hot or because the air-conditioning, when on was so loud it did not allow sleep. I often travel to Honolulu and need to stay overnight and this is the last time I will stay in the Ohana - customers beware.

I have stayed here a few times, so I'll just explain my grades so as to not bore you.Service - One of the strong points of this hotel, the front desk staff is very friendly as are the employees who work here. I was pretty jet-lagged arriving from an international flight, arrived prior to 3 pm check-in time (actually just after noon) and it was no problem, they had rooms ready.Value - A big knock on the hotel is that the restaurant is not open all day. It has select hours (breakfast and dinner if I remember correctly) only. I never tried the food so I cannot comment on that. The rooms are just ok, standard for a 2.5 star hotel.Sleep Quality - The beds are decent, but the blankets are a little thin. It's Hawaii so you're going to have the a/c on all the time.Cleanliness - My room was clean, met my standards. The hotel in general seemed to be the same way.Location - Because it's beside the airport, (like a three minute shuttle ride) high grade here. That being said, if you don't have a car there is not a lot of options within walking distance if you're hungry. I ordered a pizza for dinner because I was just staying overnight. Rooms - Average rooms, the usual amenities for this class. I think they upgraded their internet because it was faster than I remembered.Room service - Low grade because the restaurant is not open that much.Spa - They have one, I believe. If not they get a ""1"" rating here.Overall, the hotel is alright, but way over-priced (in excess of $140.00 per night).","Calgary, Canada","sonofthunder73</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",1,3.0

We arrived late with fellow travellers, and the check-in process was long and painful as there was only one lady on duty and she appeared to be on ""island time"". Our room was basic - clean and comfortable, but one of the bedside lamps didn't work. We were tired and hungry after a 6 hour flight and were told that the pool closed at 7pm and the restaurant wasn't open on Mondays. Whilst convenient, the free airport shuttle is not really free as you are expected to tip the driver $2 for each bag you have. The shuttle was made available to take dinner guests to the restaurant at their ""sister hotel"" (Best Western) down the road. Unfortunately when we finally got there it was noisy and crowded with young families and undisciplined children running around - not the ideal place for us. The staff here were also on island time, and made you queue up just to be seated. Then you had to wait again to order, and they offered us soup and salad to offset the delay in delivering our ordered meal - which we declined. The menu was classic American junkfood - so we chose what we thought was the healthiest option and ate an hour and a half. after our arrival. On the upside, the food and accommodation was fairly cheap. As Hawaii is a large US military base, the airport hotels are popular with military personnel and families, who seem to be given preference over regular tourists.

There is also a small mall on the street behind the hotel (exit out the back parking lot and then 5 minutes on foot). The mall has a Starbucks on the corner and also a few others behind Starbucks (sushi shop,pizza, L&L local style food,convenience store, etc).

We were about to embark on the Queen Mary 2 so we decided that ""roughing"" it for a couple nights in Honolulu were acceptable. We were carrying 200 lbs in luggage and decided that staying near the airport would make life simpler for us. A friend had stayed at the OHANA Honolulu Airport Hotel and said it was OK. He was exactly right. The price was approximately half of what a Waikiki hotel would cost. The Hotel was very convenient to the rental car pick up and drop off. So we booked it and were more or less completely satisfied. If you want a nice inexpensive place to stay near the airport, this is your place.Cons -- there was only one serious flaw. The WIFI was absolutely the worst I have ever encountered in a hotel. The only thing that could have been worse is if it had not been working. It worked ever so slightly better in the lobby than in our room. I wanted to download a movie for the flight and it took many, many hours. The front desk staff was highly accommodating an kept my Kindle at the front desk during the download. In the end I got my movie.Pros -- the price for sure. This was a great bargain. The hotel staff was helpful. They explained to us how to take the city bus to Waikiki and we had a great ride and saved a bunch of money on transportation. The hotel was clean and neat. The room was spacious and had an acceptable tv and comfortable beds. We did not use any of the amenities of the hotel. It was quiet. The shuttle service from the airport was excellent.SAVING THE BEST FOR LAST -- We woke up in the morning and went outside our room and discovered dozens of people running around with TV cameras and microphones on booms. There was a food tent set up in the parking lots. There were all kinds of equipment trucks everywhere. I was convinced that there had been a mass murder over night. I was almost right.

I called the operator for some first aid but she forwarded me to the manager who just said he'll call the emergency to take a look at it. Surprise! Surprise!

We tried repeatedly to get through over a fifteen minute period, then gave up and took a cab for $10. Then, we stood in line waiting at 3:15 PM to check in for another 15 minutes before we were helped. There seemed to be something sketchy going on with a guest who had charged $5000 worth of rooms and services while there on a family vacation and then having his credit card reject the charges. When we finally were able to check in, things went smoothly from there. We were given a room in the back building on the second floor overlooking the parking lot. It was extremely shabby and in need of major freshening up. We left almost immediately and bussed it to Waikiki, returning at 10PM and falling into bed. The bed was actually comfortable and the shower in the morning had amazing pressure. We were ten minutes early for the 6AM shuttle and it was packed. If I had paid maybe $100 for this hotel I wouldn't have felt so ripped off but we paid $192. I could have stayed on Waikiki for this price and just had a longer trip back to the airport.

Two associated restaurants were ok, but plan on finding other restaurants for a more Hawaii experience. Had to pay to use and print from lobby computer. Parking is expensive. I would stay again, unless I was there for vacation, then I'd go to a resort.","Denver, Colorado","JOSIII</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",4,4.0

Guides to which bus routes serve which destinations are also at reception as well as a restaurant delivery menu. The hotel also has other standard amenities such as a pool and a fitness centre.

It looks a bit old but it seems to be well maintained. The rooms are basic which include a microwave, small refrigerator, coffee pot and tube television. Ours had a balcony but it was a solid and high construction so we couldn't really enjoy it. Cable is limited and there are a quite a bit of channels that are on a constant loop so the same programs play all day long. I still can't get that ""Waikiki Beach Walk"" song out of my head. Believe me if you've stayed here before than you know what song I'm talking about. ;-)It's not in the best location either. It's located in the business district so the surroundings are a little drab and there isn't much to do if you happen to have any small children. It's either drive some distance away, hang out in the pool or stay in your room. Like many other reviewers mentioned, the on site restaurant isn't open every day but when it is, I recommend catching breakfast and trying the waffles. They are delicious! The cashier that we always got was not especially friendly though...On the days the restaurant isn't open you can walk or catch a shuttle to the sister hotel, the Best Western up the street. We went there for a few dinners and the staff is friendly there but the service is slow. Make sure you have lots of time and patience when you eat there. The Ohana has an on site store which carries a good selection of health and beauty aids as well as snacks and some clothing. A lot of their products are travels sizes and very expensive. There are vending machines located on most floors of the hotel as well. You also get free internet in your room but you have to plug in what I think is an ethernet cable into your computer/laptop or netbook to use it- it's not very fast either. But you can always go into the lobby and use their business center which consists of two computers (pay to use) and a printer. Faxing services are available for $2 a page. Parking is a nightmare. Oh my goodness you had better not leave in the evening otherwise you will be circling about trying to find some place to park when you return. There are a lot of military families (like us) staying in this hotel while in transition to or from Hawaii so parking is usually crowded. The few nights we did have trouble finding parking we did get assistance from the security guards. One night we just couldn't find a spot so the security guard allowed us to park in a tight spot behind another vehicle and phoned front desk to have them call us when a parking spot became available. It was either that or circle around for who knows how long.The hotel is pet friendly which is great and it is literally right next door to the airport which is another bonus if you are just arriving to the island or are going to catch a flight out. It's reasonably priced and relatively clean as housekeeping does a good job. There are bellman available to assist with your luggage as well as show you to your room. I would recommend staying here if you are looking for a place to rest up for a few days. If you are looking for some place really tropical and close to a beach- this is not it.","Baltimore, Maryland","clark1986</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, Maryland</strong>",2,3.0

We booked two rooms so everyone had enough space.

Summary:This is a very convenient airport hotel that has good rooms and good service. There was no aircraft noise. I would only recommend this hotel for short stays of one or two nights as the rooms are quite small and it is not centrally located in Honolulu for shopping or swimming in the sea.

It took us over 45 minutes to check into our room - there was one family being served at the time and we were the only other ones there. Perhaps this was because of the Tsunami?

In the morning when we went downstairs for breakfast we again waited over 45 minutes to be seated at the table (the place was empty!) then it took an additional 35 minutes for anyone to serve us (or even offer us a drink).

The shuttle arrived about 10 minutes after we called. A few things to note: they have a restaurant, but it only operates about half the nights... the other nights (including the one we were there) they have a shuttle to the best western maybe 1/4 mile away. We passed on that, since the seafood buffet at the Best Western would have been ~$26 / person + tax & tip. Instead check out Big Kahuna's pizza... lots of unusual choices, and a fun atmosphere.

I booked this hotel because I wanted a hotel close to the airport. It was close to the airport and provided a free shuttle.We were supposed to stay for another night several weeks later but I was so disgusted with how we were treated on the first occasion that I cancelled. The only pleasant helpful lady I encountered was a blonde lady at reception the day we arrived. Apart from that it was all downhill. A specific request to another staff member to freeze an icepack for medical reasons was met with reluctance and returned the next morning, barely cool so obviously had not been put in the freezer. We enquired about the free shuttle to the airport and were told that it ran at half past the hour and on the hour and to be downstairs 10 minutes beforehand.The morning of our departure, we rang to request the bell hop, half an hour before the shuttle was due to leave. When the bell hop failed to materialise after about 10 minutes, I went downstairs and enquired as to his whereabouts. The reply from the woman in her 20s at reception with her hair piled on the top of her head in a loose chignon was condescending in the extreme. Whilst I was talking to her I noticed that the shuttle was there and loading passengers. She told me smugly and in a mocking tone that we would have to wait for the next shuttle and that this one was full. She then waved it off at least 10 minutes early. I could see quite clearly that the shuttle was only 3/4 full and could have easily accomodated an extra 3 passengers. The next shuttle arrived and left late so we were later than we should have been to check in for our flight.I really think that management need to have a long hard look at their reception staff because they are the frontline of the hotel. No guest of any hotel should ever be humiliated or treated so appallingly. That's exactly how I was treated and it was horrible.I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. There are numerous airport hotels in Honolulu or stay in Waikiki and get a shuttle early in the morning to the hotel. Most shuttes cost between $23-$35 and you can find many reasonably priced nicer hotels in Waikiki.","Sydney, Australia","tropicgirl39</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",168,1.0

Military be ware!! Don't be mislead by Les, the so called military liaison or the images on the web site. Rooms:The website gave the feeling of an extremely comfortable, well maintained facility. The lobby looked amazing & the rooms looked as though a good nites rest would be easy. The facts were - the rooms smelled old and musty and had an overall unclean feeling. The hallways, elevators and laundry rooms were very dingy. The A/C filter hadn't been cleaned and circulated smelly air. My son and I made some soapy water and re-cleaned our rooms ourselves. After cleaning the water was gray and smell sour from the ""clean room"".False Marketing:I was told that the hotel had a free shuttle for military personnel. I was lead to believe that this was an exclusive service and only offered by the Ohana. This was used as a selling point as gas was very expensive in the area. The truth was, the military base sent their own shuttle and it went to all the local hotels. Front Desk Staff:Rude would be a compliment. Often military personnel are held to a higher standard of conduct, even during non-duty activities. Often civilians use our status as citizen soldiers to treat us with a rude or less-than friendly posture. This was certainly the case with the Ohana Inn. I often asked the desk clerk assisting me, ""How was your day?"" in an effort to diffuse any poor attitudes i may have inadvertently caused. However, it soon became glaringly obvious to me that rudeness was the standard procedure at the Ohana.Restaurant:The military received free daily food vouchers. This was presented over the phone as a major incentive for military families. However, when I presented the vouchers, we were treated with an air of being a welfare recipient. We were only permitted to order from a specific menu of bland foods like, Spaghetti and meat balls, Chicken, Noodles, etc. My family often ate at other locations just to avoid the lunch room feeling and to actually order food we would eat and enjoy.Final Straw:When I realized I had been duped into staying at a two star joint, posing as a Hawaiian Resort I made reservations at another hotel. When I informed the front desk staff i was planning an early departure I was told that I would have to pay the full $3200.00 to leave early, the amount typically paid to the hotel by the military for incoming personnel. This mad it even more clear to me that the Ohana was operating an extremely lucrative, albeit dishonest-to-military-personnel business tantamount to the off-post used car dealers we frequently warn our junior personnel about.SSG,US Army","Honolulu, Hawaii","BigRob60982</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",3,1.0

While moving to the island we stayed in a total of three hotels, this being the last one before we moved into our permanent housing. We had our dogs with us and were limited to pet friendly hotels of which there are few. This location had a friendly staff and seemed to really care about their guests. The rooms were roomy and quiet. I could not hear the airport traffic at all. The location is the typical industrial type of airport location you would expect. Guests seemed to be primarily military pcsing tothe island. For a vacation I would still suggest staying somewhere else, but for the budget traveler or if needing an airport hotel this is a better chocie than the Best Western. Both are fine, but I having to choose between the two this would be my choice. However, if I were coming to the island for a vacation I would find a resort hotel or another Ohana hotel located closer to Waikiki which would certainly make for a more enjoyable vacation.","Pensacola, Florida","mcalbreeze</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pensacola, Florida</strong>",65,3.0

Fast, efficient check-in then off to the room. It could have used a little more vacuuming (both the carpet and dirt on a chair seat from a previous guest's shoes), and it appeared that the hair conditioner in the bathroom had been used by a previous guest since it was half-empty. HOWEVER, the hotel staff was wonderful in taking care of our needs. Quick, responsive waitstaff in the restaurant and very good food. My husband and I wanted to visit Pearl Harbor before we left, and the desk clerk recommended we take the bus to the Harbor ($2.50/pp), which was much less than a taxi. We were able to leave our luggage in a locked room with the concierge. The bus stop was right across the street from the hotel, and it dropped us off at the Pearl Harbor entrance. The return was just as quick; the bus stop is literally right in front of the hotel. Their customer care was exceptional. I inadvertently left my wallet in the room (thank goodness I keep my driver's license and credit cards on my person!), which they promptly mailed it to me with all cash and cards intact.

My husband and I are both over 6 feet tall. It was an interesting night. Had we not gotten there so late, we would have checked out and stayed somewhere else for that night.
