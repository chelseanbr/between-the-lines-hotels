We interestingly didn’t feel as though the hotel was packed, which was great as we knew they were as we tried booking other rooms which weren’t available. The hotel is in the perfect location as it’s close to everything.The things we liked: - The hotel offers complimentary transfers to their sister hotels, which came handy as the express train from the airport was cancelled and we needed to take a bus from the airport (side note: we used the airport limousine bus to the hotel and I highly recommend it... It’s brilliant! The bus drive was 1.5 hours from the airport, has free wifi onboard and you can transfer from a sister hotel at no extra cost).- The rooms were cozy and and modern. - You are given a mobile phone (Handy) to take out which was great as it allowed free calls and internet access on the road. - You HAVE TO order room service as a robot delivers your items... Yip, an unassisted robot. - You’re a 2 min walk to Shibuya station which has multiple trains. - You’re a 2 minute walk from Shibuya crossing. - There’s 1 bar and 2 restaurants at the hotel. I wouldn’t recommend the bar as service was terrible on both nights we had drinks there.- There are dedicated areas on different floors for laundry (irons, washer, dryer and pants press), a drinks vending with an ice machine, shoe care room and a kitchen. - You’re connected to Shibuya Scramble Square and a few delis, external restaurants and coffee shops (Starbucks is 30 seconds from the hotel). The things we didn’t like: - There’s no concierge which ended up being an issue for booking trips. We couldn’t book tickets for TeamLab and because there’s no concierge we were just pointed to the same website with no further help than that. - The biggest issue is the traffic noise as it’s VERY loud. If you’re a light sleeper, ask for a room FAR away from the roads. This may affect your view, but I couldn’t sleep the first night, and after moving rooms, things were a little better, but still too noisy for me.- The check in was ok. It didn’t feel as though the reception wanted us to be there and was relatively moody. This is very different to the other hotels across Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. Interestingly, it was a similar experience at the newer hotel in Osaka. - There are only 2 local charging plug ports with only 1 plug point (ie no international plug points).- They mention there’s a gym but there are only 2 tiny gym spinning bikes, so don’t plan to do anything fitness related here.- When we checked out, we asked to store our luggage as we had a trip planned before heading out to Kyoto. It felt as though storing it was an issue because we needed to be very specific on the time that we could store our luggage. It was just a cold experience. Overall, a great location, but I think we’ll choose a different hotel when we’re back in Tokyo. The area (Shibuya) is a must to stay in though.","Cape Town, South Africa","TravelingRobs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cape Town, South Africa</strong>",16,3.0

It is on top of all the subway lines and the bus terminal. The hotel has a lift that goes directly down to the Shibuya Station. Whether I fly via Henada or Narita, there is a shuttle limousine door to door usually at half-hourly intervals.Mark City is a mall with many shops and restaurants. Connected to the mall is the Tokyu Premium Plaza for more shopping and a nice supermarket/food hall.Hotel rooms are relatively spacious. A standard single room is usually 20 sq m. I paid approximately HK$6500+ including tax and service for a 4-night stay booked through Trip.com and was upgraded to a twin room.Service at the hotel is not something to boast about but for me it is quite all right as I go in and out of the hotel hardly having to pass through the reception area.In general the hotel is adequately comfortable.

Right in the heart of Shibuyu. There is a shopping complex on your doorstep. I am currently staying here for 5 nights. Amenities are great. You have enough tea and coffee making facilities.But the biggest issue with this hotel is the very old hotel room. The bathroom smell is revolting- likely due to old plumbing. The toilet has a mind of it's own. If you are a fan of the 80s you would love the bathroom. I don't know how they are marketing this as a 4 star.

Arriving very late, and having unpacked my bags, I discovered on lifting the toilet cover a most appalling detail: the toilet seat had 3 blood stains on it. It being extremely late and me exhausted, I didn't complain immediately and only did the next morning, telling the girl at the reception that having paid an equivalent of 230 euros for the night for a single room, it was totally unacceptable to see this amazing sight. Having been a traveller for decades, never had I encountered such a disgusting incident not in the poorer countries and certainly never would have dreamed it possible in such an orderly normally-hospitable country such as Japan. The receptionist referred to her superviser, who equally didn't seem to know what to do except to frown and say ""oh I'm so sorry""... and when realising that I wasn't shouting impolitely but was obviously upset, after a few minutes he offered lamely a coupon for a breakfast which I have already taken that morning in their restaurant. I was also dismayed by the slowness of reaction on their part as if this was the sort of things that happen regularly? Surely not ! I'd hate to think that because of the excellent location and the gorgeous view indeed from their restaurants upstairs, that they could imagine being able to get away with something like this. I have a photo to prove this but honestly I wouldn't want to subject your readers with this gory detail. This is all I have to say, actually. (of course, the expresso machine in the room didn't work either and water spilled all over the place, but that became a kind of tragic-comic detail in the morning.)",,MaryS7391,1,1.0

But there are a few things worth knowing. The hotel has no conventional street entrance so don’t try to find it on street view. There is what really is a back door up a concealed alley that the bus uses plus two well concealed hotel lift lobbies inside Mark City Mall. The lifts go directly to hotel reception and are very convenient but until you are familiar with the layout they are invisible. The very best way in from the airport is to use the Limousine Bus which has a route direct to Mark City Shibuya with one stop. This drops you right outside the hotel back entrance with no confusion. Tickets from a stand in Haneda airport lobby (don’t know about Narita). Problem we also discovered is that some dummy allowed there to be two different hotels called Excel to open at Shibuya. If you exit the metro at the wrong exit (South Gate) without knowing then signage will direct you to the other Excel (actually Excel Stream but not signed in full) and it is then a long walk with lots of steps to get back to other end of the station. Also critical is that hotel will not check you in until the dot of 2.00pm because that is their rule. So if you arrive at 7.00am as we did, that forces you to wander the streets in the same state as you got off the plane for over six hours and it is not pleasant. So watch your timings. Otherwise it is a reasonable hotel. Fairly well organized but not Swiss level. We had a big bed and all the usuals, decent breakfast just a shame the tv had no English speaking channels. BBC and CNN were both overdubbed in Japanese.

So this is not those kind of fanciful hotel. Though I had expected it to be for the price of its room. For the price I paid, I would expect better service from the staff or to at least see more staff around, but really, all the staff I saw were behind the reception counter, thats it. I travelled with my parents, so I booked a triple room. The room was spacious enough, for 3 beds, 3 bedside table, side tables and chairs and enough space for 3 luggages. I think it is good that the toilet and the shower are in separate rooms. The room provided enough towels for all 3 of us, replenished everyday. It also provides combs, shavers, toothpaste and toothbrush, slippers, and many more. Hairdryer is also provided. The pillows are a little hard. But its better than if it was too soft. The bed was comfortable, not too hard or soft. The room does have a flask for boiling water, however, ours was already filled with water. We were not sure why, so we did not use the flask. The hotel links to the Shibuya Mark City which has some great food. Don't need to venture out to look for good food. It is near the JR Shibuya station, however, despite staying there for 4nights, we were not able to figure out how to get from the JR station to the hotel.

I choose to stay here when I can every time I have to come to Tokyo. This is a review based on our previous stay. It's a hotel you can catch the train to -from Haneda, we wheeled our 3 large suit cases straight from the belt to our room. Not much has changed. The service is still excellent and the quality is still up there in comparison to some of the other big hotels I've stayed at like the Hyatt in Shinjuku or The Prince in Shinagawa. The biggest attraction to this hotel is its location. You can walk everywhere and it will take you days to explore Shibuya itself. There's Food Show (top notch supermarket) directly across the road and Tokyu Hands (from haberdashery, toys, adventure, stationary to hardware) just around the street. You can walk to Yoyogi park, Meiji Shrine, Cat Street, Harajuku, Omotosando, Jingumae. Although in the epicentre, it's relatively tranquil from above. Views of Shinjuku is impressive, especially when there is a blimp in the air. If you want cool little bars and more neighbourhood atmosphere, pop over to Shimokitazawa - a few stops from the above ground station right below on level 1. I was there with my family this time but in the past, I've had some good nights out in the many bars and live venues in the area. Breakfast buffet is a must. Has everything you need plus more. Our daughter got quite ill and we had to call an ambulance. The hotel sent a translator to look after our needs. So much appreciation and commendation to Nakemoto san for making sure we had a good departure to the hospital and the follow up call to make sure we were okay.

Regardless, we booked a ""View Double A Non smoking"", which was located on the 15th floor. It was the most expensive hotel of our holiday but we felt worth it due to its location. The room was very comfortable for the 4 nights stay, definitely not large at all, in fact most of the room was taken up by the very large comfy king size bed. There were lots of little touches in the room that made it great, such as a vanity area with mirror for getting ready/doing your makeup in, a small table for use for eating etc, and the wardrobe was one of the largest we encountered, which was handy because by that point we'd done heaps of shopping we needed to store somewhere. The room had a view north over shibuya, but as it was down the end of the hall we were unable to see the crossing. The crossing however could easily be seen out the end windows near the lifts (great for photo purposes)The bathroom was the most disappointing part, very ugly brown tiles, but servicable. Could do with a re-do. Check in and out was fairly fast considering how busy the lobby area is. However, we stored our bags after check out for a few hours, and getting our bags back took a long time.

The cleaning guys didn't vacuum very well nor did they mop the toilet floor as I accidentally spilt some coffee on our second morning there and the stains were still there by the time we left (5 nights later). Minor detail though, as you don't come to Tokyo to stay in your hotel!!The main complaint I do have is the lack of English speaking concierge. We tried asking whether we can hike up to 5th station at Mount Fuji but the girl (while very lovely and polite) couldn't understand what we were asking. We wanted to know if we have to show our shopping at airport customs on our way out of Japan as all tax free purchase receipts were stapled and stamped onto our passports, but she either didn't know or couldn't understand. We also asked the same girl to book a Michelin restaurant for us but she said it was ""impossible"" to get a seat. To her credit, she did book another restaurant for us and she did try very hard despite her limited English.It is extremely frustrating when hotel concierge cannot effectively communicate with their English speaking customers when it is part of their job to do so! Despite that, it is in a great location and very convenient!",,Amy W,6,3.0

I created this tripadvisor account to write this post.It was almost everyday I encountered bad service staff from this hotel. My bad experience started on the first day. I was in the queue to wait for my turn to check-in. An older looking staff allowed another guest to cut my queue. A colleague of his alerted him but he ignored. That colleague of his seeing his reaction quickly ushered me to the next available counter for check-in.Second bad experience was with the housekeeping staff who brought the ironing board and iron to me. It was 1+am when I requested it. Upon receiving the ironing board and iron, I was told by the staff that I have to return within 45 minutes. I told her that it is very late and I am tired and ask if I could return it tomorrow morning, she declined.Third bad experience happened when I wanted to book the Limousine bus from hotel to Narita Airport. I book the voucher through Klook and instruction given was to exchange the voucher with the hotel front desk for the actual bus ticket and book the boarding time. At first, the staff keep saying I have to book myself as the hotel do not assist with the booking despite me showing him the voucher. I clarified with Klook and they assured that the hotel can book for me. Hence, I tried again the next day with a different staff. True enough, that staff issued me a bus ticket and a lady helped with booking the boarding time. Due to many bad encounters with the hotel staff, I confirmed with the lady the boarding time to be 9.30am, She said yes. The next day when I am checking out, I asked the front desk staff where I can board the bus, to my horror, the staff said that the bus had left. I was at the counter at 9am, so I confirm if my boarding time recorded is 9.30am. It is not, what was recorded was 7.30am. Seeing my frustrated face, the staff serving me quickly assured me that I can board the bus at 9.30am as he had included my name in it.All these bad experiences had deterred me from staying with this hotel again. I never imagine service standard in such reputable hotel can be so bad. Is it they are too complacent?",,L0vetrave11ing,2,1.0

The best feature of the hotel is the location. Their room descriptions make no sense. I booked a Semi-Double room which is only 215 square feet. The bed is a twin bed which only sleeps one comfortably. You are very cosy if there are two people. The room was so small and the bed mattress was so hard I asked to switch to a bigger room. They offered the Premium Double room which has a real King size bed and the room is 323 square fee which is about the normal size of a hotel room in the USA. The room was also on a higher floor but not facing the Shibuya Crossing.Online, the price difference is usually around $30/ night. They said “do we have a deal for you.” They said normally the price difference is around $100/ night but we will give it to you for the low low price of only $60/night which is about double of what it should be. I told them that that I stayed several times at their hotel and also was a Comfort member (their frequent guest program/ should be called Discomfort member) and it didn’t phase them. They said if you want to switch rooms you will have to pay the ransom, I mean upgrade price. Since there was no way I would sleep another night in the “mini me”room, I paid the difference. This exorbitant pricing left a bad taste in my mouth. As a Platinum Starwood member, I have stayed at the Tokyo Westin and the rooms are very spacious with some views of the Tokyo Tower and there is also complimentary breakfast and a Club Floor for Happy Hour.

Shibuya Excel was great. I checked my bags in at 8am since my room wasn't ready yet and came back at 6pm since I had plans that day. They were very helpful in directions and location was right by Shibuya Station. I booked a Ladies room on the 20th floor where of course, no men were allowed. As a couple, my friends stayed in a regular room. The bathroom had Shiseido products (all rooms) but also had an additional sample kit with toners and moisturizers (not in regular rooms). A humidifier was readily available and they had nightwear for me in a pale pink (regular rooms come in white) and slippers to use. Next time I visit, I will not pack sleeping clothes. The breakfast had a huge variety but not worth the additional $20-30/day for me since I don't each much and would rather try new foods. View was wonderful from up top though. The room itself was clean and they had laundry machines on a few floors if it's needed. Friends used it when they got soaked in the rain and mentioned the dryer was slow. You can find detergent at the local dollar store. Bonus: They also include a cell phone in your room that can be taken out. Internet is slow but useful for mapping and local calls are free which was great when I needed to make reservations. My room faced the main street (Shibuya Crossing way to my right), and at night I could hear emergency vehicles passing, even on the 20th floor. Otherwise, everything was perfect.

Not large, but comfortable with a small seating area, refrigerator, free Wi-Fi. Also there was in the room a mobile phone with a built in GPS of Tokyo's streets and attractions marked in it . We didn't use it. The bathroom equipped with toothbrushes, toothpaste ,a one-time hair brush and a lot of more comfort treats . The shower with a good water flow. The room was clean and pleasant. The bed was comfortable for sleep . The staff are nice and helpful .Important - If you arrive with a train there is no problem, go up with the elevator to the 5th floor and there the hotel reception. If you arrive with a car, you have to know how to get in. The GPS and Google Maps led us to the entrance of the train station and only after a few rounds with the car and a few phone calls to the hotel reception they explained how we supposed to arrive with the car to the hotel enter, from a side street.

I began my stay here as a solo taveler, and I found the hotel to be better than expected (or, at least better than some reviews). The room, while small, was fine for one person, as was the slightly-larger-than-single bed. And the view, oh definitely the view from the room was amazing - overlooking right on Shibuya junction. There is even a bathtub, and internet was quite decently fast. The restaurants upstairs had such a superb view of Tokyo that it was a marvel everytime I went up there for breakfast. I had the choice of either Japanese or Western breakfast - and this is where it became strange: the Japanese breakfast was very underwhelming. What a pity! So I went to the Western side every time afterwards.But the issues began when my friend arrived, and we paid extra to share a room. We discover that the room was basically the same size as a room for single, but now there is an extra bed... We paid a decent amount more basically for just another bed, and it got ridiculously cramped. Which was really not ideal, and we were not sure if it was worth it or not. Worse, the walls were thin, so you can hear everything going on in the corridors outside, including the next door rooms with screaming kids. Noise proofing is very minimal.That said, this hotel had the best location possible - right outside is the limousine bus to Haneda/Narita, and underneath is a mall that is right on Shibuya junction.Another note is that the front desk is trying, I can tell, but they really need a softer touch as they could come across as very lecture-y at times. So service there could be improved.I would rate the place a 4 stars if you are a solo traveler, and 2.5 stars as a couple.

I have been lucky to stay at quite high-end hotels (Andaz, Palace) in Tokyo and yes, they are infinitely better (no surprise there, Sherlock) but also a LOT more expensive. So the key question is: for Tokyo, is this decent value for money, and is it a pleasant, workable hotel with a room that doesn't feel like a closet. In my opinion (and my much pickier wife's), the answer is yes. The breakfast at the top floor was nice, with a great view of the city.

We walked into our hotel and were immediately impressed by the lobby which looked very clean, Grand and modern, went up to our floor, and were again impressed by the styling in the hallway....and then we opened the room door. It was tiny, old and as basic as it gets. We were staying in a Superior Double Room. There was no where for our suitcases to go, the bathroom was old and quite dingy, and the bed was awful. My pillow was stuffed with hard plastic beads and one of my wife’s pillows had a giant red stain on it. Obviously I got this promptly replaced. To the hotel’s credit, the receptionists and the concierge were quite helpful when they could understand what I was saying, but it was quite hit and miss with the staff as to who could speak English. The western breakfast we ate was iffy at best. The scrambled eggs were mush but with big sightseeing days ahead of me I felt they were my best bet at actual sustenance as the rest of the options were terrible. I repeatedly ate mushy eggs and a croissant with jam as they were the most reliable choices. All in all I would still suggest someone look into this hotel and make their own mind up because if you are relying on the train network a lot whilst in Tokyo, this hotel is really located unbelievably.

The staff was very polite and helpful. We initially reserved two three-bed rooms on 7th-12th floors and got upgraded to higher floors at the check-in. Our rooms were on two separate floors (23rd and 24th) because there are only one three-bed rooms per floor. The room is clean and has basic amenities, except for lotion. The room is good-sized, besides the three beds and a sitting area we had enough room to walk around. I never feel tight. The beds and pillows are comfortable. The hotel is not new or upscale but it is clean and nicely decorated. There was one large complimentary water bottle every day (that is nice).My daughter and I ate at the café by the lobby on our first night (so exhausted to go out). We had an egg sandwich and a cheese pizza. The food was ok and a bit expensive. We did not try other restaurants in the hotel. For breakfast, we had Ichiran ramen every day – just less than 10-minute walk from the hotel. Quick snacks and drinks during the day, we went to a 7-11 store next to the hotel. For dinner, we went to food basement floor of Tokyu department store across the street from the hotel.

They are stacked washer-dryers in the same rooms with vending machines by the elevators. There are only one or two stacked washer-dryers on each floor. The machines accepted 100 yen coins. I found the dryers were not hot enough to dry a full washing load – had to divide the load into two. There is a designated smoking area in the hotel.The hotel provided luggage transfer service which we used to send our luggage to Kyoto one day in advance before we arrived there.

Well we have been travelling quite a bit, so its quite an unpleasant surprise to hear that we cant change to a king bed or even just to have the twin beds joined together. Hmmm...The next morning, went for the breakfast at the cafe. Nothing spectacular about the buffet, not so many choices and food was average.

Plenty of food choices and excellent views of the city from either restaurant.This property stands out a bit because it has coin-op laundry machines on some floors. You can get change at the front desk and machines sell laundry detergent next to the laundry machines. Just make sure to clean the dryer lint filter before drying your clothes--otherwise it can take forever to dry and take a lot of coins.The location is fantastic.

Though ample power sockets were present, USB ports would be preferred as they are universal and less of a hassle for charging devices. Hope the hotel will make small updates to the room to keep up with the times.- Noticed a permanent stain in the carpet throughout my 7-night stay, wonder if attempts were made by hotel to clean or shampoo the carpet on regular basis. The still-great:- Room size of the standard room was still generous by japanese standards, came with a small sitting area and a separate writing desk. Huge window and great view too!- Reception staff is still professional, courteous and efficient. No problems with communication. - Location is still great and super convenient, time and effort saved in commuting and getting daily necessities. Other great thing is the airport limousine bus stops by the hotel, no need to trod around lugging heavy luggage.- Cheap food readily available, take-away bentos in Tokyu basement Food Hall, ramen eateries lining up the alleys right at its door-step, Genki-sushi and Ippuddo just a stone's throw away.

I choose this hotel consistently when in Tokyo. First of all the location cannot be beat, best place to be when you want to explore Tokyo. The airport bus limousine makes a stop directly at this hotel which is very convenient - no mucking around. The hotel is part of Mark City and has multiple entrances - extremely convenient as you sometimes tend to lose your way in Japan. Not to mention it has direct connection to the train station downstairs and is just located next to the famous Shibuya crossing- winning!! Views of people making this cross from this hotel never seems to bore me. Then when you are downstairs outside - Shibuya is at your doorstep! There's Shibuya 109 just across the road, hundreds of eateries and you're smack bang in all the action Shibuya has to offer. I enjoy the buzz and noise but I appreciate that when I retire back to this hotel- it's nice and quite. All front desk staff are very professional and most speak good English. Check-in was a breeze. I had my pocket wifi sent here prior to arrival and was instantly given the parcel upon check-in without asking. I stayed here twice on this holiday to Japan - initially when I landed in Japan and again after travelling to Osaka, I returned. I usually get the same room or one or two down from each other on all previous stays throughout the years. The rooms are spacious by Japanese hotel standards, there's plenty of room for luggage which is a plus when you want a comfortable stay. I also find the built in adaptor points on the dresser extremely convenient - you don't have to request for one at front desk. Everything is clean and amenities are always well stocked and I really like their shampoo by Shiseido. And again the city views are spectacular. My first room this stay I did have one major negative. The bed was so badly worn that it dipped in the middle and gave me back pain every morning. Upon inspection I found that because the bed was so badly worn they had to put a mattress foam topper on - however it was so soft that the bed dipped in regardless. Second time round I raised my concern regarding the last bed I got but front desk personnel either did not understand me or couldn't do anything to change it so ignored what I said altogether. I checked in quite late, so exhausted I couldn't be bothered explaining further. He checked me into a room slightly smaller than the first but had a slightly better bed with no topper. Apart from this I had a great stay like always. For the price I paid, I've had better but I return here time and time again because I just love its locality. I have recommended this hotel to all my family and friends and will continue to do so however they should just update their worn beds! ",,J_Traveller0_0,11,4.0

Getting to the hotel:By far the most convenient ever! Just take the Narita Express to Shibuya station, and you are there! Can’t get easier than that! I highly recommend sorting out your return ticket for the Narita Express immediately or the day before your going back. The queues can be super long and please allow for plenty of time for the trip to the airport! The Location:Outstanding! Forget all the hassle with airport transfers, hailing taxis and carrying luggage around. The location has it all and more! We always stay in Shibuya when in Tokyo (just finished my 8th trip!) The Room:Supersmall, but great view! A big plus for the coffee machine! Unique details:It’s situated on top of the station, can be tricky to find the entrance from the ground floor. Go for the breakfast! The view is amazing and a great way to start off your day! Customer Service:Not the best to be honest! A bit grumpy and not flexible at all.

I even called them a few times before my trip to request a city facing view and change dates and they were very accommodating and courteous. For a section of my trip I was without my family (because we were meeting up in Tokyo from separate flights) and the hotel was nice enough to upgrade me to the women's only floor. This floor is for women only travellers and the rooms have a slightly more feminine decor and a free facial steamer. It was very thoughtful of the hotel to do that for me. The hotel lounge is very nice with great coffee and I had a sorbet fruit parfait. If I have a chance to come back another time to Tokyo, I would not hesitate to stay here again.

The bed was a lot bigger than we were expecting, we sleep on a king-sized at home and this was fine for us. I thought a Double would be smaller or the same as a Queen but for some reason it felt bigger so that was a plus. Bed was firm but comfortable and pillows were fine for us as well.Every amenity you'd want is provided in the room, including slippers, toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors, shaving cream, hairbrushes (all those I've never seen provided before!), hair dryer, Nespresso machine, safe, flashlight (enjoy looking for it :) ), and complimentary bottled water (LOVED that!).As all the other reviews mention, the location is unbeatable. We were on the 22nd floor overlooking the scramble crossing, great views from all around. We took the Narita Express train from the airport and probably would again for future trips here just to avoid any rush hour issues that the airport limousine buses may face.

Makes it super convenient for the airport transfer by bus as well.For the room, I'd got a twin room on the 24th floor (there were 25 floor in the hotel, and the top floor is for restanrants). To access the room, there were 4 elevators separated from those access to ground level. My twin room was at a good size, not too big. Beds were very comfortable. There were working desk, sofa by the window.A fridge, a coffee machine, free 2 bottles of drinking water.For the bathroom, the shower was in the bathtub. All toileteries provided including handsoap, body wash, hair shampoo & conditioner. Hair dryer, foot spray, pyjamas, slippers were provided in the room. You can just check-in with no bags!For check-in and check-out process were fast, smooth, and informative. The staff were excellent. I'd been always greeted with smile from Mr. Ikeyama at the Front desk.My room rate included breakfast which could be chosen either western style buffet at Restaurant A Bientot or a Japanese set at Shunsai, which were on the top floor (25th floor). I did not try the Japanese set at all, so for all 6 morning, I had the western style buffet breakfast. One little thing was that they only served scrambled eggs everyday. So I had scrambled eggs every morning. Although repeated dish but it was quite tasty so nothing to complain! I loved their salad corner, bread corner and their fried fish and chicken karaage. From the restaurant, you can see the Tokyo skyline clearly. One side overlooking Yoyogi Park, Meiji Shrine, and Shinjuku highrises.For the location, probably the most perfect location with everything within a little walk in Shibuya area. Department stores, brand shops, discount shops, fastfood & restaurants, bars, cafes were around the hotel. There were many convenient stores around, but the nearest one was a 7-Eleven just on the next alley of the hotel.During our stay, we used Metro Ginza line a lot, as this line passes many major stops such as Omotesando, Shimbashi, Ginza, Nihombashi (near Tokyo station), Ueno and Asakusa which the end of the line.I totally love Shibuya Excel Tokyu, and if I have to choose where to stay in Tokyo, Shibuya Excel Tokyu would be my first choice!","Bangkok, Thailand","patrick-syd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",76,5.0

Third, the train station to all around Tokyo are directly accessible at the 3rd and ground levels. I have stayed at Shinjuku central which is equally good but can be very congested. This hotel is just 2 stops from Shinjuku. Fourth, there are a lot of eateries and small boutiques, H&M, Zara, theatres within walking distance.

The doors are thin so you can hear a lot of noise from the hallway and from inside other people's rooms. There is NO ROOM SERVICE unlike what is shown on Tripadvisor.

It is convenient to get around as well. The Airport Limousine has a stop at this hotel (about 1.5 hours from Narita Airport), and the complex is connected to the Shibuya subway station. At present, the Airport Limousine is doing a round trip promotion. You may wish to check out their website or ask your travel agent about special deals when planning your Tokyo trip. If your hotel is along one of their routes, it is the best way to town and back to the airport. For trains to/from the airport, I think it is only a good idea if you are worried about traffic jam, don't have much luggage and won't mind going up and down platforms. We used to take the Narita Express, but we now find taking the limousine bus less of a hassle.We had a standard room with a semi double bed with no breakfast (there are so many cafes around, we just went out to eat instead). The room was small, but not too small for Japan, considering the location. My rating for service, cleanliness and value are all ""average"" because there was nothing too impressive about these items (they were not bad though). I gave a higher overall rating mainly because of its location and view. If you are traveling with elderly parents, Shibuya may not be a good choice, as it is rather busy and crowded. The streets are always full of people until late. Before my trip, I also considered the Cerulean Tower Tokyo. However, the Cerulean Tower, a nicer hotel, is quite a bit more expensive and its location is a bit not as convenient. Their rooms are larger and it feels more quiet over there though. I was glad that we stayed at the Excel Hotel. If you would like to stay in Shibuya and prefer a nicer hotel, you may wish to book your hotel well in advance, as I found out hotels may offer early bird discount if you book like at least one month early. If we go to Tokyo again, Excel Hotel will still be my first choice due to its location.","Hong Kong, China","C K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",13,4.0

This was great since we could pack less clothes to accommodate all the goodies we planned to buy. It was ¥300 to use the washer, and the dryer was ¥100 per 30 minutes. I liked that they had separate units. In the past, we've stayed at hotels that have the washer and dryer in one machine and they don't completely dry your clothes. The only downside to the dryer here is that it only has one heat setting so I'm pretty sure it shrunk my son's clothes.. or he grew while we were staying here haha. Bring your own detergent as the vending machine only sells drinks. Beer is an option to help keep you occupied! We packed detergent in pod form instead of buying those travel packs of Tide since it's cheaper to buy and you can still use them at home. The hotel provides an actual crib vs. a Pack-n-Play. The crib does not meet US standards though as one side can be folded down. For our infant who is not able to crawl or pull up on the bars this was not an issue. For our next visit I'm not sure I would be comfortable using their crib. They did not have a fitted sheet so we had to use the provided flat sheet and wrap it around the mattress so it would have a tight fit to reduce the risk of SIDS. They provided a plush blanket that was perfect for tummy time! The room had a refrigerator with a small tray for a freezer. The hotel staff will gladly store your pumped breast milk in their employee freezer as long as you keep it in a hard bottle with lid and label it. I brought large ziplock bags for this but didn't end up using their freezer. It was nice to know they would help if the room fridge was too small for your needs, though.The location is awesome as others mention. It was supposed to rain many of the days we were visiting so it was great to be covered as the hotel is connected to the train station. You can get to the hotel via elevator or escalator so it's nice to have options. The rooms are clean and the shower pressure is great. The shower head is also pretty tall which was nice for my husband who is about 6'1"". Towels are on the thin side but you can always request more if you really need them.It seemed like most people purchased a breakfast plan with their room, us included. I enjoyed the Japanese style breakfast. The fish and dumpling changed daily. My husband preferred the variety of their Western buffet. If you want a quiet meal, eat at the Japanese restaurant. The Western buffet was much more crowded.

Also..when I wrote an email asking if they could reserve a restaurant for me in the neighborhood they told me they don't do that until you check in! Never been told that by a concierge anywhere in the world so as I said I am not impressed by the staff helping me as a guest. I would stay here again because I love the location but I feel no connection or warmth to the staff and they don't make you feel welcome. They are in a way indifferent. Hope they will work on this aspect of their service.","Hawaii Kai, Hawaii","hongo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hawaii Kai, Hawaii</strong>",62,4.0

Upon check in it becomes clear that you aren't a guest, but you are merely a transaction. I have consistently noticed that if you ask for a different room upon check in, regardless of how full the hotel is, the staff will not even entertain the idea of reassigning your room - ""the computer assigned you this room"" isn't an excuse.

Super convenient. The hotel sits right on top of Shibuya Station, just go down a few escalators and there you are. Views of the famous and busy Shibuya crossing and just a few steps from the statue of Hachiko. We stayed in a quad room---these are not easy to find in Tokyo---and it was a great option for our family. 4 twin beds plus a table and chairs. There was an electric kettle for tea and an empty mini-fridge. We were very comfortable though the room was not huge, I think because we all had our individual corners (beds) to retreat to. Though this was definitely a Western-style hotel, we got the distinct impression that westerners are not the main clientele. And for us, that was cool! First thing we noticed---the bathroom was split into 2 sections around the corner from each other. One was toilet and sink, the other sink and tub/shower. The toilet was one of those automated ones and obviously had about 100 commands; however, the instructions were only in Japanese and we were lucky we figured out how to flush it! We also had four pairs of room slippers and unlimited pairs of bathroom slippers. Shoes stay at the door. A few of the floors have laundry rooms. Again, an adventure in trying to decipher detergent and machine instructions solely in Japanese, but how nice to be able to clean some clothes on a sweaty July day. Staff at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The fluency of their English varied but we communicated well enough.

Not bad but not great. Basic and covers the essential needs. If you have breakfast at the hotel, you may get bored with the western style breakfast after a couple days. It never changes and the quality is not great. I would suggest trying the Japanese style breakfast in the other restaurant. It's a set meal and very delicious.Rooms aren't the smallest I've stayed in but they are small as is common at Japanese hotels.For transportation to the hotel, I would recommend the airport bus rather than the Narita Express train.

The beds were super-comfy and roomy. We arrived in Tokyo at 6am, and requested an early check-in. The hotel was only willing to accommodate us for over $200 (after 11am only!), which we thought was very overpriced, so we left our luggage at reception and set off to explore the city instead.

We had an amazing view of the famous Shibuya crossing and the broader Tokyo skyline, including of Yoyogi Park and Shinjuku; a wonderful, fairly large corner room with a separate area with a couch and chairs; and a spacious hybrid Japanese/western bathroom that we loved. When we checked in, we were asked if we wanted to upgrade to a larger room. It wasn't that much more, we decided to upgrade, and it was well worth it. We had large suitcases and there was plenty of room for our things and to sit and enjoy the room. The location is amazing: We were right smack in the center of bustling Shibuya center, just above the local subway and JR train lines, and near endless shopping and restaurant options. Despite this, the room was incredibly quiet and secluded. One of our favorite dinner options was buying food at the high-end grocery store in the basement of the Tokyu Department Store and bringing it to our room to enjoy with a glass of wine in the evening. The Estacion Cafe on the entry-level fifth floor is pricey but the iced coffee is fab and it's a lovely atmosphere.

Overall, the hotel service was excellent and while Tokyo is pricey in general, the rate we got and the overall value of this hotel can't be beat.

Some people might have a hard time finding the hotel because the hotel lobby is indeed located at the 5th floor of a shopping mall called shibuya Mark City. So if you are riding the metro, just find the exit to Mark City and there will be a big floor sign telling you where to go. If you land on the Narita Airport like me, make sure you go to the service counter to buy a limousine ticket (and a 72-hour metro ticket optional) that will take you directly to the hotel in less than 2 hours so you don't have to worry about taking your luggages everywhere. The Mark City mall is great, in fact, there is a Starbucks on the 3rd floor! So great for tourists that just want some nice coffee in the morning! There's also a food market at the mall so if you are tired from all the walking, just buy some food at the mall and bring to the hotel room to eat! (Tip: everything is discounted at 50% after 8:30pm so grab sushi and anything you want at that time for great price and great food!)

First of all, both Haneda and Narita airport buses arrive at the door of the hotel, and the location of the hotel is on in the Shibuya station complex. The view from the room, even from the lower floors, is excellent. The 10th floor room was smallish, but bigger than single rooms in many big cities. The bed, even in a single room was about queen size, and there was still enough room to move about in the room and keep the suitcase open. The bathroom was small with a mini-size bathtub, and a typical Japanese automatic toilet seat with seat heating and washing functionality.The breakfast is served in the top floor of the hotel with spectacular views to two directions, and from the elevator lobby one has a spectacular view of the world-famous Shibuya crossing intersection. The food was excellent quality and there were enough choises - the selection seemed the same every morning. There is also a Japanese breakfast option in another restaurant, but I did not try that.The hotel is completely non-smoking (ok, there is a smoking room somewhere), which is good for those who don't like the smell.It is possible to connect from the hotel indoors to Tokyo Metro and JR railway. I had some time off and took the opportunity to explore Tokyo. If you have heard the story of Hachiko the dog, Shibuya station is the place where it happened, and the statue of Hachiko is accross the street from the hotel under the trees near an old green railway car which is serving as tourist information booth. The Shibuya shopping and entertainment area is on the northwest side of the hotel, with easy pedestrian access to dozens and dozends of stores and restaurants. The JR Yamamoto line will take you to the most important tourist areas (from Shibuya to Harajuku, Shinjuku, Akihabara, and Tokyo which is a walking distance to Ginza) and only costed 750 yen for a day. With more expensive ticket one can add other modes of transportation, like several metro lines, Tokyo Monorail, buses etc. The amount of people in Tokyo is overwhelming, but the city is very beautiful, clean, and safe, with excellent shopping and dining options.","Espoo, Finland","Markus L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Espoo, Finland</strong>",16,5.0

I naturally wanted to be as close as possible to get the ""wow"" factor and this location was right on top of it. Further if you get book one of the higher floors, the Park view and Shinjuku skyline is superb. If you feel like a workout, as the hotel lacks a gym, the Yoyogi park is a get running spot, with plenty of local joggers.Shibuya will certainly appeal to some more than others. It is the 'youth' and trendy center hangout, with lots of fashion forward shopping, clubs, and entertainment. On weekends and at night I found the area to be filled with people hanging out, visiting bars, or smoking and conversing outside. As a more youthful area the benefit is that most places cover English with menus or servers that are fluent, in case your Japanese is lacking, and Western-styled food options in case you have a craving of food back home.As far as getting around outside of Shibuya, you are right next to the station which is on the Yamanote line, which had a good deal of sights I wanted to see along it, which saves a bit on switching lines and figuring out if your getting on the right train.Room -I booked an Excel Single, which although not large in size was well organized and definitely felt larger than it's dimensions. From what I remember, it had plentiful outlets, safe (with an outlet in it I think), Japanese bidet toilet, reasonable sized TV. Nothing was exactly luxury, but it was clean, well maintained, and comfortable. Of course, as mentioned, the view is great. Big plus was rather than having a stocked mini-fridge with overpriced stuff you're not going to touch unless desperate, it was empty and instead there is a small vending room by the elevator bank with drinks at an okay price.Price -I assumed that hotel in overlooking such a landmark would be quite expensive, as is the norm with almost all other major cities, but I found the rates quite good for the hotel and location. I stayed here end of 2013 (overdue review) and they had only renovated some rooms, so it may have changed, but it was well below what I expected I'd have to pay. It's hard to compare, as the exchange rate was much different at the time. The Bad:No extras -Other than the rooms and restaurants, there is not much else to the hotel. This is a plus if you like staying at nice hotels, but would rather not pay the higher rate for having those things in house. However, the lobby is quite small, and of the times I went through it always seemed a bit busy given the space in relation to rooms and guest count. They do offer spa services in room, so there are options I guess in absence of a true spa. Restaurants certainly looked nice, but I opted for local places.Miscommunication - A typhoon was meant to blow through one day I was staying, so I decided to book a tour to cramp activities in, anticipating maybe having limited options for a few days. Rather than running into issues trying to book it myself, I figured I could ask at the lobby if there was a concierge to assist. I showed one gentleman a booklet of the company and tour, from the stand in the lobby, that I wanted to try and book and I was instructed to take a seat at a little desk area on the edge of check-in. I sat there for about 10-15 minutes, with a several desk staff shuttling back and forth in front of me, but no one talking to me. I was going to meet up with a friend at the top of the hour and by the time I had waited, he had arrived and found me sitting in the lobby. He asked what I was waiting on, and I explained I was waiting but no one had come back to speak to me, so he asked in Japanese one of the staff. The answer was along the lines of no one knew I was waiting to be helped. Random guest sitting at what appeared to be the concierge desk with a tour booklet for while in full view, but no one thought to proactively check if I was all set?Rigid check-in - I had a good fare on a US flight to Haneda, which arrived quite early due to their landing slots, but I figured by the time I arrived, got my luggage and ate at the airport, before finding my way to the hotel, I'd be not that far from check-in time and I could luck out with an early room. Japanese transport efficiency got me to the hotel earlier than expected, even after loitering in the airport for a bit. I was told it was not check-in time yet and to come back at the exact published check-in time. I wasn't offered to have my bag held, a restaurant in the hotel that I could perhaps choose to eat in to kill time, nothing. I believe the cafe on lobby level was roped off and the lobby was full, so I basically just walked around Shibuya, with luggage, to try and remain awake. Other hotels seem willing to anticipate if a room will be available early or provide alternative and hold your luggage.Summary:Clean, modern, comfortable, centrally located hotel, without the built in price tag for hotel extras. If you want a good place to use as a base for Tokyo adventures and sightseeing. Rooms sufficient for the time you likely will spend there (some rooms fit quite a few beds if your with friend/family and don't want to spend for extra rooms). I never thought ""it would be great if they just added ____"" at any point and you can work around what’s missing easily. Maybe the hotel was in transition when I was there and the staff was working in, or there are subtle culture norms I missed and which made me felt like service was lacking.5 stars at the price I paid in 2013, 4-4.5 based on prices I see quoted at the moment.","Boston, Massachusetts","550simone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",46,5.0

It rained one day we were there and they offered complimentary umbrellas at the desk.Centrally located to the major train station, JR line across the street, a Starbucks - if you must, and a currency exchange kiosk. Do note, the latter charges approximately a 10% commission. Bring an ATV card, as you may never find an actual bank with currency exchange. I searched and searched but...nada.Everything you can ask for is right there within walking distance. Be sure to check out ""Tokyu"" store/market which is accessible from the Shibuya train station. Wish we had found it the first day. The selections there are fresh, and worthy of any sit down restaurant you would dine at. The last day we were there our flight was not until 8:00P. The front desk arranged for our pick up by the Limo Bus and stored our luggage, and then took it to the Limo Bus for us.

Why? (1) The hotel is centrally located with the main Shibuya station just at its doorstep - that means you can travel any part of Tokyo or even out of Tokyo with ease. (2) The Airport Limousine has a designated stop at the hotel - a smooth seamless ride from Narita or Haneda airports to Shibuya Excel Hotel or vice versa. (3) Fantastic views - This hotel offers you the best view of Shibuya Crossing from their glass panelled lifts and lift lobbies. You can even view the skyline of Tokyo from your hotel room. (4) Service is impeccable - I would say that their concierge counter is one of the most efficient I've come across. (5) Perfect location - Tons of restaurants and shopping places to visit and explore.The room is small - it's the standard in Tokyo. Housekeeping maintains the room well, neat and clean with ample toiletries. The restaurants (either Japanese or French-Western) serving breakfast at the top floor of the hotel offer good views of Tokyo. Given a choice, do not opt for the breakfast option. The spread is limited and is not worth the price. You can just go for a Starbucks breakfast located within the same building or a nice pastry cafe (I forgot the name) next to the entrance/exit of the Tokyo Metro. Check-in and check-out times are fixed. No early check-ins, no late check-outs - no matter how big a suite you booked. You will be treated like all guests, no exceptions. Earliest check-in time is fixed at 2pm or later. So be prepared to queue like all guests. All guests must check-out by 11am, unless you are a ""Comfort Member"", you get to check-out latest at noon.Will there be a third stay at the hotel?

And virtually ontop of a supermarket so you can stock up.Shibuya station isnt the labrynth that shinjuku station is. Its much easier not just to get around but also to find the right exit. I always exited at hachiko exit which isnt the closest exit to the hotel, its about a 2 minute walk to the hotel but it was always fun just to be in that crossing area with all that energy)The only downside to being in the middle of the action is that youre in the middle of the action. My first night i thought that the next door room was playing their tv loud but it was in fact outside. I was on one of the top floors but even then the noise was still intrusive until 12am when they must shut all the music etc off. Also japanese emergency vehicles must play their sirens at all hours because I was awoken the first night in the early hours of the morning by the sirens.But then thats the price you pay for being in the middle of the action and being central. I dont know why they havent invested more in soundproofing the rooms, but for me it was too darn loud.Not loud enough to not want to go there again. But i think I would see if there was a wing of the hotel that was quieter.Oh and there was an average western buffet that was ok.

This hotel was the best location. With the Shibuya train station connected to the hotel, it made it the perfect way to get around especially when it was raining and we wanted to get right on the train. The hotel was clean and nice and while the bed was a bit firm, it was still very comfortable. Great bathroom with lots of amenities (shampoo, body wash, conditioner, tooth brushes, etc...). Great view with buffet breakfast for additional charge. The room was quiet and air purifier helped block out any outside noise. Elevator and most rooms have great views of Shibuya crossing. The only areas for improvement: 1. A concierge that speaks English. It was pretty difficult to communicate with the staff; especially when at one point I needed a doctor. It would have been nice if there was someone more fluent in English to assist with certain day to day needs. 2. A pool or gym. 3. The restaurant and breakfast are overpriced. You are better off leaving in most instances for any food you might need. 4. No english speaking TV channels - not that this is a make or break as you rarely watch TV on vacation but it would have been nice to have one channel to watch.

Not true and no problem, go door to door from Airport to Hotel if you do the following.At Narita, I booked the Airport Limousine bus (directly opposite exit from Arrivals) and this will take you (after one other hotel stop) directly to the hotel's (street) entrance. This is at the 'Shibuya Mark City' stop and the bus stops at the Airport bus stop outside the hotel, where you wheel your luggage along a short distance to the entrance to the hotel where down the hallway is the hotel reception.I arrived early, so my luggage was stored for me while I went exploring.I scored room 2208 (on Floor 22) and it had the most expansive city view of Tokyo, it was fabulous. It was a single room but the bed was more of a small double and it was very comfortable. The room was spacious enough for one person, it had a desk, chair, relaxing chair with foot stool (to enjoy the view), a spare cushion stool, dressing table with wing mirrors, a variety of (phone) chargers, notepad & pen, fridge, ice bucket, (ice was available from a particular floor which I forget), water cooker (which keeps the water hot), wine and tumbler glasses, mug and cup, pyjamas/kimono, bathrobe, disposable and real slippers, excellent range of toiletries, fluffy towels, bath, hairdryer and a coffee maker.The staff were extremely helpful and made an appointment for me to visit an English speaking doctor and get medical treatment (on a Sunday). They ensured I had a printout of the address, arranged a taxi for me and spoke to the taxi driver. I am extremely grateful for this service.I did not eat at the restaurants but this hotel is in a shopping mall with lots of eating options. The ""Food Show"" food court on (basement) floor B1 in the Tokyu Shopping mall next door has the most extensive array of take away foods available, catering for every single taste; fresh and beautifully presented. It also has an International wine, beer and spirits shop there. The fresh dumplings there were cheap and delish. Just wished I'd discovered it earlier than my last day. There are nearby 'Family Marts' for mineral water or other essentials.Only glitch at this hotel was the lack of WIFI connectivity for this room, my mobile connected no problem but my laptop wouldn't at all and after going down to reception (where the laptop immediately connected, proving it was not an issue with the laptop). I was supplied with a modem to plug into the room locally and then it was all fine. A staff member did come up to the room the previous night with the modem but he did not plug it in and he just advised me to disconnect my mobile and then he said my laptop would connect up (which it didn't). I think he didn't know about plugging the modem into the room.A one day pass for unlimited subway travel is available for 650 Yen, this can be purchased from the Shibuya Station Ticket office. The trains show and announce station stops in English also. Subway maps are available from both hotel and ticket office. The lobby has English info on Shibuya and Tokyo. Often there will be English signage for Tourist information and subway exits.Japanese people are extremely helpful and will always make an effort to help even when they do not speak English.

I really like how central this location is and how easy it is to come and go from this hotel - even with luggage during rush hour. Plus the views are incredible (they have these great little maps in the rooms that tell you which building is which). The restaurant is very nice (and the choice of Japanese or Western breakfast is perfect), as is the lounge. The restaurants in Mark City are also very handy. We were traveling as a family of 5 and had two rooms. The one room we had with a double bed was small (not unlike other rooms in Tokyo), but we found the triple room to be very spacious (not just Tokyo spacious, but generally spacious). Another surprise was how quiet our room was, and how effective the block out curtains were - these are big pluses when staying in Shibuya. :)The hotel was a little tricky to find at first (it was rush hour and we were 5 people with luggage). What we learned was to look for the station exit for 'Shibuya Mark City' (a shopping center). The hotel is part of this complex. The station merges with Mark City and the elevator for the hotel is essentially between the station and the Mark City shopping center, but it is easy to miss. If you have followed the signs to Mark City the elevator for the hotel can be accessed from the same floor as the Metro Station Office. The corridor to the elevator is marked from the sides and there is a floor mat with the name of hotel (I cannot remember if it is marked from above). Anyway, this elevator will take you to the hotel lobby, which is on the 5th floor. If you end up outside the station, it is best to find the Hachiko exit. Marc City is across the street (behind Hachiko's back) - as you cross the street (don't cross the scramble intersection) you will see an outdoor escalator that leads to Mark City. Don't go up this escalator but look for the elevator through the double doors to your left. This elevator is the same one that you can take from the station and (again) on the 5th floor you will find the hotel lobby. As I said, I really liked staying at this hotel. And so did the rest of my family. Everyone was friendly and helpful. It was a great modern hotel in a bustling center, with easy train and subway access to the rest of the city.

Take the central exit - you don't need to go outside for this one or the Hachico exit where you will be outside but Mark City is easy to see. Upon arrival we were checked in quickly and we had upgraded to a corner room with a view of the crossing via the concierge prior to arrival. Even though we were facing the crossing it was inevitable that there was some noise it didn't bother us - we were too exhausted! The hotel was quiet though. The hotel is clean and had a calm relaxed atmosphere. Our room was on the 18th floor and was the first room from the lift, there was no noise from the lift. The room was clean and large with a small seating area, the view of the crossing was fantastic as was the view of Tokyo (you can see Shinjuku from the window and Yyoggi Park). There's a fridge and safe in the room. The staff were excellent whenever we contacted them and their English was great compared to our Japanese. Breakfast was included and was always fresh with exceptional service. Some reviewers complained about the variety of food - I'm not sure what people eat at home but we were more than happy with the breakfast. There is a washing machine and dryer on the 8th and 10th floors which are in with the vending machine - they aren't big but at least they are there.

When we checked in, the lady at the front desk said this room does not exist. We knew it was too good to be true. However, they put us in a room 4 four beds, and a living/dining area. The beds were slightly bigger than a twin size, but not quite a full size. There was a shower, tub and sink that was separated from another bathroom with just a toilet and sink, so both could be used at the same time. So convenient for our large group!

EVERYTHING is literally right under your feet. JR. Station, Metro lines, shops, supermarkets, food halls, cafes, restaurants etc. EVERYTHING. The hotel also has buses that run to Narita and Haneda Airport. The bus stop is right outside the hotel lobby on the 5th floor. No need to book in advance, just get on the bus and pay the bus driver directly. Sign up as a Excel Member and get discounted room rates. Their English website doesn't provide much information so I emailed them directly to make a reservation. The hotel was very accommodating as I kept going back and forth with travel plans. I originally booked a Standard Twin room with 2 x double beds for my family (myself, husband and 2 girls aged 3 & 5). In Japan, it is quite common for kids under 6 to sleep in the same bed as their parents. Saying that, their double beds were much smaller than the double beds that I had earlier in the week at Sheraton Grande Tokyo Bay, so they offered us an upgrade to a triple room at a discounted rate when we were checking in. The triple room was perfect for the four of us. My husband and I each had one bed and our girls shared another. The room had separate toilets and bath areas. The husband was pleased about not having to share the toilet with 3 other females.Our room was on the 14th floor and it had an ice-vending machine and 2 drinks vending machine (dispensing beer and other soft drinks).The hotel was quite strict on the check-in time and won't check you in before 2pm. We arrived at the hotel at 1pm and they told us to come back later.The staff were all fluent in English, so no issues there. However, service isn't great. The service is good to the point where they provide you with just enough but they definitely don't go out of their way. The very few times I had gone to concierge to ask for directions or to pick up something, there was never a smile that went along with it. It kinda made you feel like you were imposing on them.

Shibuya is on the Yamanote line, which is good if you have a JR rail pass, but there are also a few subway lines running through it (which you'll have to pay for) which makes it an easy location to get almost anywhere in Tokyo from without many line changes. The rooms are a reasonable size (we didn't ask for a larger room so I assume we got the standard size) and the higher up floors have an awesome view of Shibuya. I didn't specifically ask for a higher floor, so was very pleased to get one. The room had a coffee pod machine in it, which pleased my husband who was suffering from a lack of decent coffee after three weeks in Japan. The bathrooms are well stocked with toiletries, I think you could travel to Japan with nothing but your clothes and you'd be sorted! Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, travel toothbrush and toothpaste, razor, soap, shower hat, brush and cotton pads are all there. Also hairdryers so don't bother brining your own. The bed was slightly less firm than the usual western bed in a Japanese hotel, which was nice for a change! The rooms all have a safe. The staff were helpful and several of them speak English well, if you need to ask for advice or directions. We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the food, but they have a restaurant on the 25th floor which I'd assume has great views and might be worth a try.

The hotel is within the shibuya train station and thus gives you access to all transportatiin forms except the shinkansen. The hotel lobby is on the fifth floor. There are separate elevators to hotel rooms, and a separate elevator that leads to the Mark city mall, trains and the street level. The mall is on the third floor after turning left from the elevator. An escalator to the fourth level of the mall brings you to their restaurants which are affordabke and excellent. An escalator down to the second floor leads you to a walkway with its attendant crowds heading either to Tokyu department store on the right, or to the tanagawa entrance and exit of the Yamanote train line, your friend to exploring Tokyo.If you want to go to street level, just use the hotel elevator to the first floor. When you come out it's the shibuya scramble! From here you can explore shibuya shopping. Hotel rooms are fair by japanese standards, fast free wifi, ice machine and vending machines on each floor. The staff speaks excellent english and is quite helpful for directions and suggestions. A bentiot restaurant on the 25th floor gives a fair western breakfast which is filling but serves the same stuff day in and out. I suggest you skip the japanese breakfast at shunshai resto next to it. It serves a set japanese meal of dry salmon, pickled vegetables, rice and miso soup. Definitely not worth it. But both restaurants give you a great view of the famous shibuya scramble, so bring ykur video cans or phones with you. Some bad points- tv is just japanese channels except for bbc and cnn and a korean and two chinese channels. You would think they would cater to their foreign tourists.They do not provide free bottled water, but water from the tap is drinkable and tgere is an electric hotpot boiler provided. And with family mart closeby and 24hour, you can buy drinks and put them in the empty refrigerator provided.

Looking down below, you'll see the Shibuya scramble. On days when it's about to rain, you can sit by the window and watch the clouds slowly cover the landscape before your eyes. Quite mesmerising!Rooms are very clean and well maintained.The only thing is that the room I was in was a little noisy. So I could continuously hear sounds from the streets below, and what I made out to be part of the tune from ""Superman"" being played over and over again. I can imagine it would be annoying for some people, but I actually took comfort in having some noise in the room. What was annoying or rather distressing though was the blare from the police sirens because we were rather near Shibuya Police Station.

From experience, unless you're in a villa or suite, the usual lay-out for a triple or quad share room would have all the beds lined up against one wall (where the 3rd or 4th beds are usually folding beds) and there would hardly be space to walk around or leave your luggage. This was not the case with our room in this hotel (although the pic of the room when we booked online looked this way). Here (Room 1114), 2 single beds were on one side of the room, and 2 twin or small double (slightly bigger than the singles) were on the other. This was the prefect set up for us--3 adults and 2 toddlers. The single beds could actually be moved together to make a bigger bed (for Daddy and our 3yo), while I occupied 1 of the ""bigger"" beds with our 1yo. Nanny took the other big bed. Not only that, in the middle of the room, was a dining table for 4, with ample space to move all around it. We actually had enough space for the 2 boys to run around, while our 2 strollers were parked (not folded). We were also able to pack away our luggage in the closet.Another plus: the bathroom was split into 2 rooms: one had the toilet + wash basin, and the other had the shower/bathtub + wash basin. Which really does make sense when there are many people sharing the room.Standard room amenities were provided. Especially helpful to us was the hot pot, where we cold heat water for the kids' oatmeal. Our floor (and I'm assuming this is true for all floors) had a vendo machine for drinks and an ice machine.Side note on some room for improvement (pun intended): more closet space. Quad share means more people, and the space provided was just not enough. Also, although it was clean and pleasant, the room could use a little more sprucing up or modernizing.I need to mention also that the hotel location was just perfect for us.1) The airport shuttle (we arrived via Haneda), stops right by the hotel lobby (about a few meters walk from where the bus stops to the lobby doors). Even more convenient, the shuttle we took just made 3 other quick stops before reaching the international terminal.2) The hotel sits on top of a major metro station- the Shibuya station. Needless to say, this gives you easy access to most of Tokyo.3) The JR line station is just across the street (which made going to Disneyland very convenient for us).4) The hotel sits on top of a mall (Mark City) with so many food options. It was most convenient for us to take many of our meals in our room because of the kids (good thing we had a dining table!), and we had so different options to choose from everyday.5) It's right across the famous Shibuya crossing, so many stores within a 5 min walking radius.","Makati, Philippines","Chrin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Makati, Philippines</strong>",46,5.0

Perfect. It was obvious some ""rearrangement"" of furniture had taken place to accommodate us. Spacious rooms by Japanese standards meant that we had lots of room to move around without bumping into each other at every turn. The only thing I could have wished for was a higher floor so we could better appreciate the view from the hotel in what was a prime location in Shibuya. To top it off, the icing on the cake was the Airport Limousine Bus service which left the hotel from the same level as the lobby reception.

Not sure if there are machines on every floor. Most of the guests when I was there were non-Japanese. Quite a few Chinese tourists. Probably because, as I said, the hotel was a bit on the pricey side. And the desk staff speak English. I ate breakfast in the top restaurant just once, mainly to check out the view. I'd have gone up there more but $25 for a basic buffet is a lot of money. I made sure to go on a morning when the skies were clear. One morning I had ramen at a 24-hour place down at the street. Another morning I ate at the Kobeya cafe/bakery within the station. And other times I ate at coffee shops that were on my way to work.The airport bus makes the location very convenient to/from both Narita & Haneda.If I were on a private trip, I'd search for a better deal and a place with a proper ofuro.","Detroit, Michigan","mdchachi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Detroit, Michigan</strong>",142,5.0

I actually even called the hotel before my trip and was impressed by their language skills and professionalism over the phone.The hotel is situated right next to the Shibuya station, a stop on the Narrita Express from the airport. You can reach the hotel without going outside but it is a fair walk if you have many bags. If you are traveling light you will be fine. During my stay I also found out you can book a limo bus to the airport from the front desk. This is helpful if you shop a lot and find you have more bags than you came with.I requested a room overlooking the Shibuya crossing. It was AMAZING. The view is awesome. I could sit up there next to the window for hours. The best room in my opinion is the corner room overlooking the crossing which is 01. For example, the 17th floor would be 1701. The corner room has more space and the best view.I travelled alone and always felt safe here. I heard some street noise but nothing bothersome and I'm a very light sleeper. The hotel was spotless.

There is also free wifi. Plenty of trains run nearby and the noise will affect some rooms but not all. Rooms on the south side and higher up will be quieter. If you don't spend much time in the hotel, however, the hotel cannot be more ideal. From the airport, there is a straight airport bus that takes you to the doorstep of the hotel.

You will get to almost anywhere in Tokyo with at most one transfer by train. There are many lines nearby as well as the JR line to travel out of Tokyo.

However, we didn't have the time to plan ahead on this trip and only booked this one because it was close to the Shibuya train station and the iconic street crossing. We did pay the extra fee to get an ""upgraded"" room on the top floor (the elevator required a special key to gain access), but the room was average at best. It was small, with a normal bed, and normal amenities. The view was excellent, though. Overall, this is Tokyo, and the small accommodations are to be expected. That being said, I would recommend this hotel because of it's location and access to what the city has to offer. Also, we were able to have wonderful drinks and appetizers at the restaurant located below the hotel. Our table had a perfect view, and the drinks were strong. A definite plus.

The room I had overlooked Shibuya and part of the world famous crossroads. It was clean and well presented with an introduction note from the maid assigned to the room, which was a nice personal touch. In typical Japanes fashion staffing levels were high and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was OK, I only tried the western option, and it was no worse or no better than other hotels. I did have dinner one night in the restraunt on the top floor hoping to take advantage of one of the set meal options that offered relatively good value for money, given the prices on the menu. However, I was informed it was not possible and had to select from the A La Carte menu. When I asked why all I got was ""Not Possible"" which I am inclined to think was due to language difficulties rather than any other reason. View while dining very impressive, as was the presentation of the food. However, be prepared to have to eat something else later if you haver a normal appetite as the portions could not be described as generous. I di try to get a dessert menu, but again the language barrier prevented this. This might indicate that there was a shortage of English speakers, but those staff who could speak English did so very well, certainly better than my awful attempts at Japanese. I think I was just unlucky. There is very little wrong with this hotel, there are probably cheaper alternatives, certainly better places to eat but few have a better location. The only downside is there is no flexibility when it comes to getting an early check in with out paying extra, even if the room is available. After a 12 hour overnight flight the last thing you want to do is jhang around the lobby until the clock gets to 1400.If landing at either if Tokyos international airports there is a reasonable shuttle bus service that drops and picks up right outside the hotel. Time to Haneda was around 50 minutes on a Saturday morning and cost 1030 yen (around £5).

It was in a fine location - once you could actually find it. The sign out the front is incredibly small, and can pretty much only be seen when you are right at the entrance. It is located at the between the Shibuya Mark City Shopping Centre and the Hachikō entrance to the underground station. Literally across the road from the latter. We had two Japanese men assisting us with their 3G, and it still took 20 mins in the rain... Once they found it, they took us and our luggage all the way to the hotel - Japanese people were very friendly and lovely; and willing to go out of their way to assist us tourists. The staff at the hotel were relatively helpful, but friendly, or competent in English is a bit of a stretch (considering our other experiences with Japanese people in service positions and the general public, there definitely seemed like an element of poor customer service, especially in light of the wonderful experience we had at the ANA Crowne Plaza, Kobe immediately before, and the helpful young men who escorted us to the hotel). We had a fair amount of trouble getting recommendations for late night eateries on the first night. And subsequent requests for tea and room service were ignored - possibly a language issue, but, seriously, who can't understand 'can our tea please be replaced?'The room itself would have been a fine size for two adults, but it was quite tight for three adults each with their own bed (twin beds, and a roll out). The luggage situation was that we could only open two out of three at any one time, and one had to be opened on the table provided. The bathroom was fine, and was surprisingly large compared to the living space. We visited the cafe in the lobby a couple of times for snacks, and aperitifs. The service was very friendly and accommodating and the food and cocktails were delightful. All in all, the Shibuya Excel Hotel was a fine place to stay.

I've stayed at the much more expensive Cerulean Tower Hotel in Shibuya and wished I stayed here again, because it's so much better. The staff here are friendly and happy to help.The rooms are small, but that's to be expected in Japan. Our room had a view of the Shibuya scramble crossing, which was cool to watch at night. Rooms are very clean, comfortable and well maintained. Housekeepers were friendly too.We went up to the top floor and had the breakfast they offer. It was a traditional Japanese breakfast (salmon, omelette, miso soup, rice, sushi etc.) and it was good, so if you're into that sort of thing you should definitely try it. The location of this hotel really couldn't be better. It's on top of Mark City, which is a small mall connected to Shibuya Station. You can get pretty much anywhere in Japan from here because it's a large station. Mark City isn't much for shopping but it's great for getting food ! I recommend you go underground, there's heaps of nice small shops selling cakes and things that people don't often see. :) I tell everyone who goes to Tokyo to stay here.

The bath room & toilet is separated which is good so that we dont have to rush to use. Limited English TV channel unless you want to pay, the instruction manual warn you about pressing the ""PAY"" button. If you have kids please be careful else you will need to pay.

Basically you can access anywhere in Japan from this hotel.Room: For a hotel in Tokyo, it's pretty big. (which is to say, average size in the States). Amenities: Includes everything, such as blow dryer, toothbrush, toothpaste, razor, etc.Cleanliness: Any hotel in Japan is guaranteed to be cleaner than hotels in US. I have yet to experience cleanliness issues in Japan.Service: Excellent. Took less than 5 minutes to check in and check out. Front desk literally jumps to help you when you come up to the counter. We had to leave our bags for couple of nights while traveling elsewhere, and it was no problem.From the airport: Limousine bus will take you right up to the entrance of the hotel, it's about 30 dollars/pp. If you take JR, you have to cross the street, so it can be tricky with lots of bags, but doable as well.The only downside of this hotel is the noise level due to the location. Since it is right in the center of Shibuya hub, you will hear some outside noise even late at night. If you haven't been to Shibuya, it's like NY Times Square on steroids, so it can't be helped. It wasn't too bad though, and I would take convenience over a little noise anyday. (just join the party!)Overall, considering all the factors, I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Tokyo.

First, it's one of those tiny room Japanese-style hotels with rooms so tight you run into the walls, nothing in the mini bars (use the vending machines!) - and everything just seems 20 to 30 years old. Make the mistake of taking a nap and putting a do not disturb sign, and you get no service the entire day. Wifi terribly slow. Second, taxi's. They have two entrances. The logical place where you would expect to get a taxi is a ramp that is primarily used by buses so you have to be lucky to find a taxi there, and because it's Shibuya, taxi's don't come up the ramp because there is so much traffic down below. So, request a taxi - and expect a 10 to 20 minute wait. but you can go down in the heart of Shibuya and fight it out. But, in fairness, this place was packed with what seemed to be happy people - and I never tried any of the restaurants which there seemed to be a few. Of course, if you want to be in Shibuya (Times Square on steroids), this is smack in the middle of it - so that's why people emphasise location/location/location. But, as a business hotel, this one falls very short. And, I can't imagine bringing a family here with children, it would just not work. So - if you're solo or in a couple, want to be in the hear of the shopping district and don't need ultra luxury - hey, this is for you. but if you are a standard higher end business traveller or coming to Tokyo with family, try your best to go somewhere else.","Singapore, Singapore","AsiaMorgan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",230,2.0

When we booked the hotel we requested a higher floor with a view of the crossing. We lucked out and received room 2102. I would recommend requesting this early rather than waiting closer to your arrival date as I am sure they assign rooms as they get booked so don't wait until the day before and then be disappointed your request wasn't fulfilled. We took the NEX train to the hotel which is 50% off if you have an international passport. The train went from JFK to Shibuya station and then you need to follow the signs to Mark City Centre and then signs to the hotel. We took the airport bus back to the airport and it was a little easier to manage as it picks you up right at the hotel and saves having to tow luggage and a 4 yr old through the train station. The staff speak a little English but don't expect fluency - you are in Japan! Lots of shopping and restaurants in the area. We ate at the Japanese restaurant on the 4th floor in the Mark City Centre. There is always a wait. Get a ticket at the machine in front of the restaurant and wait on the bench or in line nearby and wait for your number to be called. We thought the people were waiting for a tour or a bus or something initially when we walked by but nope it was for the restaurant. There is always a wait regardless of when you go.

If you want to visit Tokyo's most vibrant, trendy and buzzing neighbourhood then stay right in the middle of it. The Tokyu Excel hotel is located on top of Shibuya station so it is easy to find and located right in the middle of the hustle and bustle. All rooms are located on rather high floors, so good views are guaranteed. The famous Shibuya crossing can be seen from most hallways, so even if your room doesn't provide a view of the crossing you can still take pretty pictures by walking to the end of each hallway.My room was on the 22nd floor and while the hallway smelled like mixture of old cigarettes and feet, the odour in the (no smoking) room was just fine. The rooms have a reasonable size and are packed with a desk, a chair facing the window, a flat screen TV, a (little) plant, a safe deposit box, an empty fridge (buy your own snacks at one of the many convenient stores), a coffee maker and a phone charger. Wifi is free and fast, cable Internet is available as well.The noise from the streets is clearly audible in the rooms, but in a way this adds to the charm of the hotel. On the other hand: the giant billboards play the same lyrics all day long. Hearing the same lyrics and sound effects every minute or so can drive one crazy! You booked a hotel in the very heart of Shibuya, so you'll know it! And... as of midnight even the streets of Shibuya go quiet and one can enjoy a good nights sleep.The only disappointment was breakfast. It costs 2,571 yen which gives the guests a choice between Japanese and Western breakfast. The Japanese breakfast is a set meal including a (dead) fish, which for me is a no no. The Western breakfast does offer plenty of vegetarian options, but not very healthy ones. The bread is either white (no nutricial value at all) or croissants (a bundle of the most harmful fat). The muesli wasn't the healthy kind either. There is no whole wheat brown bread, no nuts, no rice crackers, no truly healthy options. So in the end I paid 2,571 yen per day for a glass of orange juice! What a disappointment!

(We rode the northeast corner guest-only elevator, which is made of glass and has a stunning view of the crossing, up and down a few times, to get our crossing “fix”.)","Toronto, Canada","ensco3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",147,4.0

Awesome!* on the nightstand, they have provided multiple charging adapters (see picture). This is brilliant. I was able to charge my iPhone and Samsung at the same time. They have 5 connector choices, including iPhone 5 as well as old 30-pin connector.* Great view of Shibuya, including the famous intersection.*location, location! A short walk to my favorite noodle place and so much shopping. The metro is right there. You are really in the heart of it at this hotel.Need to improve:* western style breakfast buffet is small and the scrambled eggs are runny. The bacon is meh. Go for the Japanese breakfast instead. * air-con turns off by itself in the middle of the night which makes for a very sweaty wake-up in the middle of August when it is hot and humid outside.*no coffee in the room, only tea. Also no bottled water. All in all, I really appreciate this hotel. I will stay here again.","Lugano, Switzerland","Wings415</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lugano, Switzerland</strong>",41,4.0

One place where they had been busy printing out maps to for us (hello, its 2014, i don't need a hardcopy map) wasn't even open the day they sent us in. That was a total fail in my mind. When checking out, we went to the restaurant for a cup of coffee and wait for a friend. The coffee was $10 seriously.

Yet, there was something undesirable: the air-con was too weak. It would be better if you're staying in a non-smoking room. However, in a smoking room, it can be a problem.

This was my third trip to the region in the past year, and the first time I paid so much for a room (due to my trip being so last minute my usual place was booked out!) I was initially completely surprised by the fact I did not at all feel welcome when I checked in at the reception desk - which is so NOT the Japanese way. Their customer service is usually beyond reproach. And, at over $300 a night for my room, this was the first hotel I have ever stayed anywhere in the world where one's luggage is not taken to the room for the guests. More an observation than a complaint however. I had flown into Tokyo at 8.30am so by the time I arrived at Shibuya it was more 11am and too early to check into my room so I went out walking for hours. Returned to take occupancy of my room, desperate for a cold water, and not a single thing in the bar fridge: nothing. I checked the documentation and no 'room service' either until later in the day.Towels - I would advise packing your own. Towels in the room extremely thin - matching the oh-so-thin toilet tissue.I found it difficult finding my way around and, as an elderly person, thought it would have been wonderful if I was told that the airport limousine had dropped me at the fifth floor, and I then had been given a map to work out exactly how to get around the hotel.On a positive note, the room was larger than the 'normal' standard accommodation space in Japan. Beautifully presented bed linen. Great view of course.

The AC would not turn on unless the lights were on, which was odd. Bathroom was small and came with basic amenities. View: Stayed in the 20th (out of 25) floor and we had an amazing view of the city. Although we requested a view of shibuya crossing, it was only a partial view of it. Value: It was definitely a fair price (around 150USD/night)Food: We didn't order any but we had wine at their local restaurant.Proximity to Shibuya station: 3 minute walkNote: Shibuya is a pretty sketchy place to walk around at night. I was offered adult services numerous times by rude vietnamese touts who get angry if you ignore them. In addition, if you go north to kabukicho, you'll probably be constantly bothered by nigerian touts inviting you to check out their bar. Bottom line: No pool or fitness center. I'd recommend this place if you know Japanese well or if you're a local. In the future, I think I'd stay in Roppongi or Shinjuku.","New Brunswick, New Jersey","Jay S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Brunswick, New Jersey</strong>",10,3.0

We stayed at the 23. floor with an amazing view over Yoyogi Park way to Shinjuku. The room was great, very clean (but i must say the standard for japanese hotels is very high though), it was the perfect size and the rates are very affordable. If you are in Tokyo to explore the city, thats the perfect place to stay. Tons of small restaurants around (lots of places in shibuya are open alsomst 24h, so if you have to fight a jet lag, the best thing we did is to have some gyoza and soba at 3 in the morning). The hotel is connected (!!!) with the Shibuya railway/subway station, what more can i say? Of course it is a big hotel with lots of room, if you are looking for a small boutique hotel with personal service thats not the right one, but still we felt very good stying in Excel Tokyo Shibuya.","Berlin, Germany","810425</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>",7,5.0

Room was quiet enough although can still hear trains a little, since it is literally on top of Shibuya JR and Metro stations. The room quality is good but not great. Reminded us of hotels in China with nice looks but some cheap things too. Bathroom door is like cardboard. Cell phone charger didn't function. They supplied two bottles of water upon arrival and that was it! No refills the next day. They really missed an opportunity with this too. Instead of explaining that they had excellent tap water (they did) and they were trying to save the earth from water bottles, they simply said we should buy water at the vending machine on our floor! Pretty cheap for a room that costs several hundred per night! Coffee machine was nice (Nespresso) and they have a good quantity of plugs to use for electrical devices. TV ok - but no English stations at all, except pay. Refrigerator good. Bed was comfortable, but pillows not that nice (one foam, one regular) and too small for bed. Room maid service adequate. Shower good. Toilet spray seat of poor quality and did not work consistently (noisy too). All in all, we enjoyed staying here - right on top of the Shibuya ""Times Sq"" area and some of the restaurants in Mark City are also good. So convenient for trains too.

That trip down in the glass elevator overlooking Shibuya crossing is good fun. Great view, so try to get as high up as possible (we were on 19th). Also, perfect for coming out of the station after a day of sight-seeing and straight into the hotel. Lots of great places to eat within 10 mins walk. More than that though, this is just a very nice place to stay - we paid a bit extra for a three-person room but it was worth it. It was the biggest room we had anywhere in Japan, three good-size beds plus lounge area. Interestingly, the toilet and bathroom were separate, which is useful but unusual, particularly in space-conscious Japan. The breakfast is a bit overpriced for what it is but again - the view. Staff were very helpful, especially in storing luggage and booking the bus to the airport - no hassle at all, just walk straight on from the lobby.

It is located in downtown Tokyo. Actually Tokyo has many down towns. This one is the downtown for Tokyo's citizens. The hotel is surrounded by all things Japanese- Japanese shops, Japanese food places, including multi-cuisine restaurant choices,and Japanese people. In fact the hotel forms the top floors of the local railway station. so if you wish to travel cheap all around Tokyo, using the subway system, you cant hope to stay in a better place.The rooms are large, all the windows have cityscape, so it doesn't matter which floor you are on. When evening falls, the city lies spread out below, twinkling like a thousand diamonds. The view justifies the location.The beds are large. there is a flat screen TV, a mini fridge with tea & coffee service, and free wifi connection.The toilets are high-tech, with artificial intelligence, that makes you momentarily uncomfortable, but you quickly get used to, and even enjoy the warmed seats, the bidet & water spray functions with their controlled speed and pressure. They grow on you.The restaurant serving breakfast is on the top floor. The breakfast, included in room charges, is a buffet with separate rooms for ""European"" and Japanese breakfasts. Although the spread is incredibly large, and the seating adequate, I would advise that one goes early, as the waiting lines become long, if you reach late.

The airport shuttle bus (Airport Limousine) stops directly in front of the hotel lobby.Cons - Hotel check-in staff unfriendly and cold. Did not feel any warmth in the handling of my check-in process. No smiles was seen on any of the staff's faces. They were also very inflexible when I asked for my check out to be extended. All they allowed was an hour and anymore than that was chargeable. I also felt that they were not approachable, maybe because I'm not Japanese.....The room was also not cleaned up well as dirty glasses and used yukata was still left lying around even after the room was supposedly cleaned. The pillows were also not arranged properly and neatly, just thrown on the bed.To be honest, the popularity of this hotel is solely due to its location.

We can choose between the Japanese breakfast or the western buffet breakfast, both which were fine. But what tops it all was the location!! The location is just second to none: right in the middle of everything. Shibuya in itself is already a great area, and the Shibuya Excel Tokyu Hotel is in the middle of where all the action is. Everything is right there at your doorstep: endless shops, department stores, supermarkets and convenient stores, and a wide array of restaurants. You don't have to worry about running out of cash because you can find an ATM on the 9th floor of the Tokyu Department Store just across the hotel, and also on the 7th floor of the Shibuya 109 for Women. It is directly linked to the Shibuya train station, right at the famous Shibuya crossing (which we can see from the room).

We felt very comfortable and safe in the bus.We purchased the 2 day round trip Bus and Subway combo for $60.00 each-what a bargain since we used the 2 day pass while exploring the City.Check-in was a breeze, with staff very welcoming and helpful. Our room was more than I expected- huge, full of amenities (robes, slippers, etc.) with comfortable beds.Our room was facing a brightly lit huge billboard but the heavy curtains with shades helped a lot. We also had a nice view of the Shibuya crossing which was an entertainment by itself. The hotel is in a busy area but the noise level is controlled and we had a great night's sleep. There's a lot of choices for places to eat, a department store and convenience store in the hotel center. 2 floors down is the food hall with so many choices. In the hotel's vicinity is a plethora of shopping and dining destinations. It's a one stop shop for us and very ideal for short visits. The subway line is across the hotel, and can be accessed through the walkway bridge in the hotel- again, so ideal since it was raining on the days we were in Japan. Had breakfast on the 25th floor and it was so nice-the view, food selection and service was fantastic. Breakfast was $25.00 and well worth it. Took a cab to the Meiji Shrine ($8.00) and walked to Harajuku. On the way back, Harajuku was a short subway ride. Upon check-out, the staff helped us with our luggage to the bus, and took care of all boarding requirements. Much more efficient than airline travel.

And most importantly, we had all of this at a really reasonable price (about 175$ a night) which is why I give this a 5-star rating.The only downside is that the room size is quite small compared to international standards, but this is Tokyo where it seems to be the norm.

However, this time it was completely full so my second choice was the Tokyu Excel Hotel Shibuya.As most reviewers noted, this is a very very convenient hotel pretty much attached to Shibuya Station.Why from two stars to four stars you ask? Upon check-in, I had requested a high floor non-smoking room. The staff at the check-in punched a few keys on his computer a few time and said nothing about my request and handed me the room keys to a 7th floor smoking room. He then brought out a laminated flyer asking if I would like to pay extra for a nice room. This hotel was already more expensive than the Granbell so I declined. As a single male traveler who can rough it at times, I thought I could handle the room.... wrong! The room reeked of cigarettes. The lighting in the room was dim. The bed was against a wall that had scratched wallpaper. View, what view? Open the drapes and you can see a retaining wall. I gave in and called the concierge to ask how much it would cost to upgrade to those fancy rooms. $40 USD a night.What a difference! I got the top floor, 24th (25th is actually their highest but that's where the restaurants are). The room was non-smoking with two double bets. Huge bathroom. Fantastic view of Shibuya. The room was large not only compared to Japan hotels, but compared to any hotel world wide. It was spotlessly clean with an air cleaner/humidifier. The air conditioning worked perfectly. Large TV and all the bathroom toiletries you need. Should I book this hotel next time, I would definitely ask for the rooms on the 24th floor.

The lobby is very small and the front desk staff is very cold. I cannot say she is not nice but just not the warm, big smiles I used to get from most Japanese front staff. Believe it or not during my 4 day of stay, every time I need to ask someone at the front desk, it had always been this girl.We stayed at the ladies' floor. The carpet was quite old and dirty. They do provide cleanser, toner, moisturizer in sample size each night from Shiseido for ladies' only rooms and it is a nice touch. Other than that, the room looks quite outdated and nothing special.We also tried both the Western and the Japanese breakfast. The Japanese breakfast is ok but definitely have better ones at the hot spring hotels. The western breakfast lacks variety and quality is only so-so. It is right connected to the Shibuya station and a department store which could be both plus and minus. Of course it is convenient but at the same time it is also super crowded and busy all the time. I would not recommend doing the Narita Express as it is a long and confusing walk to the hotel. Take the Limousine bus instead.I guess I am just too used to the standard of Century Southern Tower in Shinjuku - they have way better service, large and calmer lobby, newer rooms and better breakfast.

My friend and I were very excited about the location as it was PERFECT!!! The Shibuya Crossing can be seen from the hotel windows and is located right outside the hotel entrance. Great restaurants and shopping is located near the hotel so be prepared to do some walking because the neighborhood is filled with stores for both men and women. Harajuku was only one train stop away about 5- 7mins, while the Tokyo Tower was 15-20 minutes away and Tokyo Disneyland is only 25-30 mins from Shibuya Station, which made the location even better as the Shibuya Station entrance and exit is located right next door or across the street (depending on where you exit) to the hotel. The rooms were comfy, the staff was really pleasant and though we didn't want daily cleaning, they did provide us with towels and other items needed daily.

I was really happy with place. It is at the famous mega-crosswalk that is so often featured in films on Tokyo with the zebra crossings zigzagging across the street. The ride to the Tokyo Airport can take a while and the Shibuya station is one that has a direct connection, which was a plus for me. The main train station is right across the street from the hotel which I really appreciated. The vibrant and interesting neighborhoods of Harajuku and Shinjuku are nearby and it didn't take look at all to get to the fish market, Ginza or the Imperial Palace from where I was. There were tons of great stores and restaurants just a stone's throw from this hotel and since it was pouring when I was there, that was definitely a plus. The hotel itself was ok. I had a nice view of the famous crosswalk and was high enough to see the city skyline. The rooms were nothing special though - fairly small, but from what I've read they seem to have been on par with other hotel rooms of this size and class. Breakfast was not included and I never found the gym, but there were enough places nearby for breakfast and I did enough walking that it really didn't matter too much. So, in short, I would say that if you're looking for a convenient launching spot for a short trip to Tokyo and don't plan on spending much time in your room, this is a great place. It was clean and efficient, but the location was everything.","Washington DC, District of Columbia, USA","garspolyglotte</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia, USA</strong>",79,3.0

With the great selection of restaurants within 5 minutes walk, one does barely need to venture out to get fantastic Japanese specialities (however, see ""Caution"" below). The hotel has good meeting room facilities, albeit rather expensive (approx $50 for two hours and there's a minimum of 1 drink order per meeting participant). The meeting facilities tend to get booked, so make sure this is secured before setting meeting agenda etc.Hotel rooms are small, but clean and beds very comfortable. Beware though that ""non smoking"" needs to be emphasized upon both booking and check-in (apparently, since I was first given a smoking room). The breakfast is a little minimalistic in selection, and the breakfast room is rather starkly lit (resembles a cantina at a struggling company at best…) and the breakfast is not cheap (approx $22 for the ""buffet"").So…the ""Caution""…: If you ask the concierge at the hotel for restaurant suggestions, make sure you indicate the price level you're looking for, since restaurants can vary widely on pricing, even for ""entry level"" Japanese foods like Tempura. We were recommended an (allegedly) fabulous tempura restaurant around the corner, to realize that the menu (which was sparse) had main courses typically in the range $80-110 (for food that you would expect to pay $15 for at most elsewhere. But, the concierge staff was excellent, great command of English, great smiles and always there to assist to find a ""regularly priced"" restaurant too.

I had contacted the hotel 3 months prior to see if they would hold our luggage for a week while we traveled throughout Japan by train (we were coming back after to stay). They promptly and politely replied that it was no problem. Upon check in, the front desk clerk had told me that they had saw my booking request to be on a higher floor. I was informed we were going to be staying on the top (24th) floor of the hotel. Despite the clerk's broken English, he did his best to tell us about local restaurants and shops in the area. Location: It is actually part of the Shibuya station - you don't even need to go outside to enter the hotel. Look for signs and head towards the Shibuya Mark City complex. The lobby is located on the 5th floor of the building - you can enter from the 3rd floor of the Mark city or 1st floor from ground level. Note that if you're coming via Narita Express, you have to make you way to an upper platform and walk along that for 300m. We spent half an hour in the train station looking for the right way out. The hotel itself looks down on the famous shibuya crossing with many dining and shopping options nearby.Room: Small room by north american standards (~200sq ft) but typical for Asia. We had a double room with just enough room for 2 large suitcases. Bathroom was compact but clean. We had a fantastic view from our room on the 24th floor. Didn't hear any noise from the rooms beside us but strangely, could hear the occasional ambulance down near the shibuya crossing.

If your older, or are not travelling with kids - Stay in Shinjuku. Couple of traps. The Southern Century and Sunroute (both popular choices on trip advisor) are NOT in Shibuya. They are in Shinjuku.

From Narita airport you can take the narita express so cheap if you take return trip or one way trip with suica card included (only for foreigners) or limousine bus. Limousine bus might be more practical if you have a lot of luggages. If you take narita express you might need to at least get down some stairs with your luggages in order to go to the hotel from Shibuya station. but afterwards the building is connected to the hotel building. For the room : I got the 7th floor room (actually the first floor for the rooms) even facing Shibuya crossing you got no views except for a big publicity panel. This room was very depressing and the bed very uncomfortable. Asked for another room at higher floor and were told no more big bed room but only twin bed room left at higher floor and would have to pay 2000Yen per night. I took the upgrade for the nights left (except the first night) and were very happy then. The view was wonderful and the bed was much better. The rooms are quit small but for Tokyo and the price it was good.For the service : very good as everywhere in Tokyo, people are willing to help but not everybody could speak good English.I will go back to Tokyo for sure as I really enjoyed the city but might try Shinjuku instead of Shibuya as there is not much to do by night (shopping).

The hotel offers a shuttle to the airport, which I've never used as I prefer to take N'ex in from Narita, but other guests have told me it's affordable and efficient.

I had my own room and my parents had their own double room.Pros:-Location:Superb location to get to from Haneda airport and about 60-85mins by limousine bus from Narita Airport (note: this timing was early in the morning with moderate traffic). You can order a limousine bus from any airport and also from the hotel reception. It stops right outside the hotel and is a great, easy, good priced way of transport. Alternatively, the hotel is superbly stuck onto Shibuya station/Shibuya crossing and you can get the Tokyo express line to and from the airport this way. We only used the taxi from Haneda as it was close. But wouldnt recommend to Narita (too far and too expensive! - even the front desk will tell you that!).Customer Service:Impeccable customer service as you would expect. Humility, decency and extremely good natured staff everywhere in the hotel - from the lobby and front desk to the restaurant staff for breakfast in the morning to the cleaners. Just amazingly perfect. Notably the honesty and assistance they show you in helping you plan your stay is just excellent. The front desk guided me on some of the things to see and which order as well as providing me with maps, bookings for dinner and otherwise - with no complaint and no quirks. I cannot recommend this enough. Rooms:Really good size double room. Larger than normal expectation in Tokyo. Parents room was an upgraded double which was even bigger. Please ask at desk for upgrade options. Impeccably clean and cleaned regularly. Breakfast:We didnt use the restaurant for anything other than breakfast (which was included in our price). There are too many restaurants and cafes (starbucks etc) in the station (about 5mins within the same complex) OR outside that warrants you taking a stroll. No need to eat here. The breakfast however was perfect. A good selection of western (fruit, cereals, eggs, toast, bacon/sausages etc) as well as local cuisine - which was also nice aswell. If you can, id definitely try and get this within the price. Itll set you up for the day.I cant thank the staff enough for our stay. Both my parents and I loved the rooms and the service we were given.

The rooms are very clean and comfortable but a little dated. There was a washer/dryer in the vending room which cost 100 yen per load. The location was wonderful. We had a room overlooking Shibuya crossing. It is easy to get anywhere in Tokyo from the train station downstairs. I agree with another reviewer how said the entrance was a little difficult to find.

Rooms are much smaller and not as luxurious however, the rooms and hotel are impeccably maintained. There were several beautiful Ikebana arrangements on display.

My mother and father in law were on one floor and my brother in law was on another floor at this hotel.

The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was surprisingly quiet given its central location and being right above Shibuya station.Hotels can be very expensive in Tokyo so we were very surprised that the Excel was very reasonably priced!The only downside for me was the breakfast. A little on the average side for my taste. Nothing interesting there. I would suggest the shopping centre below for meals.The staff were very friendly and helpful.

Nothing went wrong, but I wouldn't say we had a pleasant stay as well. Everything was kind of just alright but there were hardly any nice touches, and the staff were helpful and well-informed to the extent we had any queries. That said, it is really easy to underrate this hotel and I think it represents great value for money given its great (Shibuya isn't really ""central"") location and links to the Subway, private subway lines and the main JR station.Rooms: Hairdryer in the room. Trouser press. Air conditioning controls thankfully in English (we read Japanese, but really really slowly...). Bit cramped overall and bed sizes on the small side. Clean and comfortable. Best bit of the room was THE VIEW. As some other reviewers have indicated - getting a view over Shibuya's famous crossing was quite a show in itself and the kids spent quite a bit of time looking at ""the bees"" and ""the mushrooms (when it was raining)"" colliding into each other every 2 minutes or so. Tiny tiny thing - could do with a room safe.Food: didn't try the inhouse restaurants but Mark City (right below the hotel) provides as much Japanese food as you need. Tokyu's foodhall (also underneath the hotel) gives you the authentic Japanese supermarket foodhall experience with all the usual shouting thrown in. Candy store within the foodhall was quite fascinating.Staff: friendly, helpful and well informed - up to a point. Not really great with off piste requests, but that's Japan for you and not really a reflection of poor customer service at this place. When things went slightly awry (room card key didn't work on day 4), problem got fixed rally quickly. English levels were adequate and we had to resort to a bit of broken Japanese from time to time. *** MAKE USE OF THE LUGGAGE SERVICE!If you're travelling into other parts of Japan, make use of Japan's luggage service which delivers your medium/large suitcase to any part of Japan within a 2 hour slot on the next day for about 1500 yen (approx £11). We pre-packed 2 suitcases, sent them on their way and they were waiting for us at check-in when we arrived in Kyoto. Forms are all in Japanese (helps if you print out your next destination's address in Japanese text) but hotel front desk will help you fill this out.","London, United Kingdom","TravellingToothbrush</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",31,5.0

It was our first time in Tokyo and I must say, this hotel is great! The location is awesome and is right across the street from the shibuya station, which has basically every train line you could need. The hotel overlooks the main square, so we had a great view, but it was still really quiet at night. The rooms are small, but not unbearable. They are very clean and the bathroom was nice. There was free wifi in the room and it worked great. The hotel staff was friendly, but didnt speak english that well, so we didn't use them a ton for recommendations. I would definitely stay at this hotel again and would highly recommend it to my friends.

Nevertheless the location of the hotel is great:The Pros:1.) Direct drop-off to the hotel by the Airport Limousine Bus from Narita. (prepare for a really windy and cold arrival upon exit from the bus as the parking lot is open).2.) Access to the 4th Floor Food hall of the Mark City Mall next door is a plus (access to Mark City is better on the 3rd floor than the Lobby because of the tight lift provided by the mall from lobby to 4th floor).3.) Proximity to the Tokyu Supermarket and Shibuya train station across the street. The Tokyu supermarket is the best place to grab some Sushi or Sashimi for Dinner. They offer 20% discount after 6PM and rivals the quality in some of the best restaurants. Remember, the supermarket not the food hall right outside it. Just buy some soy sauce in the supermarket as they don't offer it for free.4.) There are also a lot of reasonable eating outlets to the left of the Hotel (upon exit from the G/F lobby). Soba, Ramen, Yakiniku, Donburi, everything you want in such a small area! 5.) There are a lot of vending machines in the hotel lobby even a washing machine in the vending area per floor of the hotel.6.) Access to Starbucks (3rd Floor) and Excelsior Cafe (4th floor) in Mark City. Great sandwiched in Excelsior as well.The Cons:1.) The Shibuya area is filled with young people, this is the only reason I can attribute to the area being generally dirtier than the rest of Tokyo. Small trash can be seen everywhere. Compare this to the Ginza area and other nearby areas and you will know what I mean.2.) We left used cups and teaspoon from the tea service in the room and came back to find then un-washed when we returned. I really don't know if its customary in Japan not to have this cleaned by the maid service. 3.)The cleaning service was generally not that good. We only found the room really clean (1) night out of the (4) nights we stayed. We constantly found our used Starbucks coffee cups still lying on the floor next to the trash bin due to it being filled already.4.) You will constantly hear the train all night (stayed in the 8th floor). So this will be a problem if you are a light sleeper. Just drink a 500ml can of beer from the vending machine and you will be all set for the night. :-) Some tips for Families with Strollers or Baby Prams:1.) When taking the train.Take the South Entrance of the Shibuya Station (to the right when you cross the street). This is where the lift is located, took me 10 min. just to find it.2.) Most of the restaurants in the 4th floor Food Hall of Mark City next door is very child friendly.3.) Remember to take the 3rd floor access to Mark City from the hotel and just go (1) flight up the escalator.4.) Most if not all convenience stores do not sell fruit so if you want or need some for your baby or what not get it from the Supermarket (the Tokyu supermarket is small so go off-peak hours) or the fruit stand right outside to the right of the Hotel G/F exit.5.) ask the hotel for extra towels for your babies as they wont give you extras unless requested.6.) The Hotel doesnt offer baggage assistance so expect to log your own luggage to and from the lobby and/or bus.You will see that the Pro's out-way the Con's but given my experience here and in Shinjuku, I think we will try Ginza next. I think it is much more laid-back and definitely cleaner.","Manila, Philippines","eejster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",24,3.0

We had an issue with the room upon arrival- heavy smell of perfume (not something I brought up but noticed by the lady who checked us into a room). Without me mentioning it she had our rooms changed and we were given some complimentary breakfast coupons. I really appreciated that and I thought the Front Desk staff were really friendly and professional. The rooms are sound proofed, we could only get a room on the 7th floor because of the room change and I was apprehensive about being so close to the street and the train station- but it was really quiet and peaceful which was impressive. Overall I thought this a great hotel for the location and price- and I recommended it to three groups of friends who have made subsequent bookings in Feb and March. However one thing that was really, really appalling and actually quite rude- the Hotel Restaurant Manager. We spent 10 nights at this hotel- we spent a lot of money and I would consider myself a fairly good guest. We had breakfast on the 25th floor (which has amazing views btw)..we returned to our room but Room service were about to clean it. Instead of interupting them we decided to go to the lobby and let them complete. While down there I decided to get something to drink- it was Sunday morning and very quiet- my partner and I went into the lobby lounge restaurant, which is an open planned area. After being seated I ordered a 990yen smoothie- my girlfriend with me decided not to order anything as we had just eaten. Please bear in mind there were only 3 other people in there in approximately a 150 cover space. The server went away and a few minutes later a jumped up man (the Restaurant Manager) came over pointing at the menu and in poor English declared ""one person, one order"". I politely explained and showed him my key card that I was a guest at the hotel and was waiting for 5 minutes while our room was cleaned and that I would like to order a smoothie just for myself while we waited. He shook his head ""one person, one order"". UNBELIEVABLE. There were no signs pertaining to this..and one would think as the restaurant was virtually empty and that we were guests we have have been treated better. Basically we had to order something else or leave. As my partner and I were embarrassed (the other 3 Non-Guests in there were looking by now) I ordered a slice of cake as I did not want to get up and leave and upset my partner further. This incident was unacceptable- I couldn't really make any points to him as a) he was not listening and b) his English was poor. It ruined the stay in many ways- and I would not ever recommend anyone going in there. Shameful for what is a nice hotel. We would have eaten there a number of times but after this incident refused too- so in the long run they lost income from this dreadful, dreadful service.","London, United Kingdom","Always T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",10,4.0

The Shibuya subway station serves as a terminus for 3 different metro lines, putting the whole Tokyo within reach, and has 15 (!) exits; plus there are at least two more JR (Japan Rail) lines going through the same plaza. So every day, there are tens of thousands of people going to the shops and restaurants in the area. On week-ends, thousands of teenagers and young adults descend on the plaza looking for company and entertainment. And Shibuya Excel Hotel serves all this up to you on the platter. The hotel is situated right in Mark City shopping center, with multiple entrances at different levels. One takes you to the shops and restaurants; another to the rail stations; and the one on the first floor puts you right in the middle of the action on the plaza. TripAdvisor lists almost 3,000 restaurants in Shibuya, and many of them are within walking distance to the hotel. Plus there are stores and clubs aplenty, of all types, sizes and price ranges.The hotel itself is not fancy but perfectly serviceable. I was lucky to get a room on the 16th floor, which had a fabulous view of the area. The glass elevators display the area quite nicely as well. My room had a comfortable king-sized bed, with one firm and one soft pillow, a reasonably sized desk with a wired Internet connection (included in the room rate!), a little dressing table, and a dresser with a couple of drawers and a built-in mini-fridge. The closet was OK but had only 3 suit hangers, which wasn't enough for all the business and casual clothes I brought for an 8-day stay. The bathroom was small but serviceable, with a decent, clean shower/tub, a full-sized counter, and high-tech toilet seat, with both a heated bidet and a ""shower"". There was no cake soap, instead there were huge pumps with body wash, face soap, shampoo and conditioner. The bath towel was ample and absorbent, but I was given only one; there were two tiny hand towels, not nearly as absorbent. A very nice touch was a tray full of spare toiletries - very welcome, because somehow I forgot my tooth-brush and had to ""borrow"" one from the tray (it was replaced every day). The room had a nice TV set, but even though it showed two English language channels (BBC Word News and CNN) both were dubbed in Japanese so I could not hear any English at all; unfortunately I do not speak Japanese so I had to go cold turkey on TV watching for a week.There are at least 3 restaurants associated with the hotel, but the prices there were outrageous (something like $30 for breakfast!) so I just took advantage of the fantastic variety offered by the location. There is a fabulous Sushi restaurant (Midori Sushi) on the 4th floor of Mark City that I highly recommend (my Japanese hosts from other areas of Tokyo all knew about it), and I also found a great place two blocks away, called Chapon, where I could have a full dinner with a drink and a dessert for almost the same price. In the 8 days I stayed at Shibuya Excel, I had to ask the front desk for help multiple times; I never had to wait more than a minute, and the staff spoke good English and were uniformly pleasant and helpful. So to summarize - a perfectly clean and decent, if somewhat cramped, room, with a great view, and good service. At a very reasonable price, too (I booked pre-paid special rate).

The result was a small queue at the lobby many mornings. I have never been in a hotel where no one has been able to check in and then at the miracle hour, everyone can check in.

Not to mention Shibuya Crossing is literally at the entrance of the hotel. I later stayed in Ueno on our way back to Tokyo and it felt like I was in the sticks, a 20-30 minute train ride to any of the major spots of the city. Save yourself the hassle.Although I warn, Shibuya is a very young (teens and twentysomethings) and hip area. The trend here is to eat at instant-type Japanese restuarants, shop, and hang out with your friends in trendy establishments. Being a bunch of twentysomethings we fit right in and LOVED the atmosphere but if you're a bit older and want a more sophisticated Tokyo experience, you might feel out of place - check out hotels in Ginza or Shinjuku instead. The hotel itself is nice but nothing overly special. Roomy, the beds were a bit stiff but we got used to it after a few nights. We stayed in a triple room on the 18th floor with a nice view of the city. The curtains block out the light and noise very well - could hardly tell what time it was when our room was so dark!

The air turns off when you leave the room and the air conditioner cannot get the room cool enough at night to sleep with a down comforter.

The Shibuya Excel has all three. It is literally part of the Shibuya Station metro station, meaning that if you are in Tokyo in full summer you can entirely avoid the dreadful weather and take your air-conditioned path directly to your next train. Shibuya station is also on the Yamanote line (which goes around Tokyo like a big ring); the Yamanote is the one train line that is the best friend of all those who go to Tokyo for the first time. And for those afraid that being attached to a metro station is a negative, please keep in mind that metro stations in Japan are like awesome shopping centers, with great fresh food courts, and highly rated restaurants. So, no need to fear.Also, the Shibuya Excel is right in the midde of Sibuya square... if you are going to Japan, this is where you want to be. The place is so characteristically Japanese you will have a blast. You are also a short walk (or 1 station) away from Yoyogi Park (where you can visit the Meiji Jungo Mae shrine), and shopping districts like Omotesando and Harajuku. Shinjuku and Meguro are also close by on the Yamanote, and Kamakura (with its wonderful temples) is no more than a 1 hour train ride away (making it a perfect day trip).Finally, you want views. Have breakfast or dinner at the restaurants on the top of the Excel for breathtaking views of the city. I have never been in a room in the Excel and not had a great view. Solid all around.One negative comes with the rooms themselves. If you can, pay some extra cash for the extra square meters, cause the smaller rooms are really SMALL! No joke. True story.Other than that, great staff and great stay. And one final suggestion. If you are leaving with a plane, always reserve a bus ride to the airport.

The bathroom was a little cosy but certainly not in any way claustrophobic, though I was a little saddened to find that my toilet seat was not heated as i'd come to expect- this due to the hotels wish to be as green as possible in the use of electricity etc. I was exceptionally lucky to get a room overlooking the scramble crossing and the rooms very cleaver glazing meant that I heard only a little of the noise from crowds/advertising boards in the late evening. The entrance to the hotel is a little tucked away, with the main lobby being reached either by a lift from the 3rd (possibly second) floor of the Mark City complex or via escalators on the 5th, however if you exit at the gate just before Hachiko it's fairly well a straight line and, should you exit at Hachiko, Mark city is the very obvious sky scraper to your direct left- also taking in the limousine bus will bring you directly to the entrance if you've the spare pennies for the journey (the desk will also take reservations for a return trip at any point during your stay)It's basically adjacent to Shibuya's R station so you've easy access to all the tourist spots via the Yanamote line as well as various other lines that run from the station. Breakfast was not included in my stay and I found the hotel's buffet a little over priced for the small selection I found at 7:30, however there is a combini just a short walk down the hallways of Mark City and the hotel supply an empty fridge that could easily be filled with more perishable items/large drinks containers! All in all a much more impressive hotel than I was expecting for the price and certainly worth the rating it's getting here! Staff as friendly as expected for the Japanese and everyone I dealt with spoke very good English considering it's not actually a requirement.","Ilminster, England, United Kingdom","Tash B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ilminster, England, United Kingdom</strong>",7,4.0

Fantastic to use as a base for travelling to other parts of Tokyo and its outskirts.- Usefully connected to the Mark City shopping complex. The food hall (Tokyu FoodShow) in the basement is a must.- Just in front of the famous scramble crossing and Hachiko statue leading to all the major shopping malls and eateries in Shibuya.- The Airport Limousine bus stops exactly at the hotel.

Thanks to Tripadvisor reviews, I knew to ask in advance for a quiet, non-smoking room with a safety deposit box and I was given a room on the 24th floor which had all these things although the hotel could not foresee workmen doing repairs under floodlight on a rooftop terrace opposite at 1am!!! My room was spacious but felt less so because of the busy patterns (all different) on the carpet, walls and furnishings. It could have accommodated an easy chair which would have been useful as I stayed for ten days and got fed up having to sit on the bed to watch the TV. The bathroom was quite small and smelled musty despite the front desk assuring me the extractor fan was working.I was also surprised that the bathroom did not have a high tec toilet. The furniture in the bedroom was surprisingly scruffy. I had to ask for extra towels and hangers (which were instantly supplied as the staff here are very helpful ). Breakfast was served on the 25th floor with great views of the city. There was a good selection of cold foods. The hot food selection was a little limited but the chef did make excellent bacon and eggs on request. The staff in the restaurant were exceptionally courteous and helpful and I was especially impressed by one waitress who, by the second day knew that I liked tea with milk and kept refilling my teacup. I didn't try room service as it looked quite pricey, especially when there are so many restaurants nearby, but I did have the in-room massage which was excellent and very reasonably priced. For those who don't carry a laptop, this is rentable for 1000 yen per day or there is rather cramped computer room where the charge is 100 yen per 10 minutes. All in all, if this was my first experience of Tokyo hotels I would recommend this one but for elegance and tranquillity I prefer Hotel Century Southern Tower.",Berkshire,"willow26</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berkshire</strong>",15,4.0

We were a little early (12:30) so the hotel kindly offered to mind our bags.At 2pm our room was ready and we were on the 15th floor - we caught the outdoor/clear lift which I was a little excited about because of the amazing view it afforded us of Shibuya.The room was relatively spacious but the bed was smaller than I expected - that said it was a semi-double so I shouldn't have been surprised. The view from our window was great especially at night and the view from the elevator area on each floor is spectacular - the ultimate view of the Shibuya crossing.I couldn't for the life of me work out the internet - had easy plug in ethernet at every other hotel that worked straight away but this I couldn't figure out. We were only staying one night so I didn't bother to ask staff for help. I did ask staff at reception for help to get to Haneda considering I didn't have the internet and they were incredibly helpful.This hotel is gorgeous and I was happy enough with it - the room was much bigger and nicer than we had experienced at other places.

I have totally no complaints about the hotel, as my room on the 23rd security floor had a great view. Internet speed was excellent and the room was comfortable enough for me.Breakfast was acceptable with a Western and Japanese mix. Problem is that on some busy days, you probably have to sit out and wait for a table as one of the restaurants on the 25th floor is being renovated during the time of my visit. Restaurant location on the 25th floor was a plus as you'd be having food overlooking the city.The room has everything you need for a pleasure or business traveller. What I like was not the small puny shampoo, conditioner bottles but full size ones. They give you a hairbrushes, hair dryer, and an empty fridge so stock up yourself. 7-11 or 24 hour Family marts are 100 steps away only. The hotel sits right on top of Shibuya Mark City, and all around within a 20 min radius is shopping heaven ... if you are a teenager.Also the fact that Shibuya station has the Narita Express which runs straight to the station from the airport (1 hr 20 min journey at 3100 yen), walk out and you are looking at the hotel. And because Shibuya seems to be an intersection line, you could hitch a train ride from this station to almost anywhere in Tokyo.The area is vibrant and restaurants abound and aplenty, though you would have greater choices if you speak Japanese. However, you have your usual Macdonalds and Burger King, and Outback Steakhouse and Dubliners which could get you eating well, if you miss your Western type steak or burgers. Its a nice variation with Kebab and Indian food also to be found. If you are an avid shopper, then this is the place to go.Shibuya boast a younger crowd mix, and if you dont like crowds, you have to live with it. But it is a great location to find strange looking fashion like purple bleach hair, or even manga style fashionistas walking around.If you would like a more mature type of group, Roppongi or Shinjiku is just a few stations away where the more foreigner friendly crowd are. Nothing dangerous here except for the occasional drunk teenagers around 2 am onwards puking their guts out.On an overall, no complaints except at S$300 per night, it is on the high side ... but then again, with location comes price.","Singapore, Singapore","ShahrilHarman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",40,4.0

First things first, this hotel is a great hotel in the perfect location. I said perfect location! You just cant beat it, if its your first visit to tokyo and you want to be within walking distance to shops, halal food, amenities, rail station and the madness of japanese fashion. Its the equivalent to staying in oxford street with, regents park and Piccadilly down the road so expect the same type of atmosphere.And just for the record, most people speak english or will make an effort to speak english. Which is more than i can say for english speakers, because im sure you wouldn't try and speak japanese if you were approached in your own country by a japanese tourist.Ok so let me break things down for you for those people who want a step by step guide.-Airport to hotel.Get the airport limo (which is a coach) to the hotel, when you come of arrivals after collecting your luggage, the desks are right in front of you, just go up and tell them shibuya excel hotel and they will sell you a ticket for 3000 Yen and direct you to the bus stop which is just outside the entrance doors. Your ticket will have a time on it, they run around every 15 mins, and are ON TIME!.  Its gonna take you around 1 hr 30 -2 hours to get to the hotel, the time varies on rush hour traffic, but hey its a free sightseeing tour of the city. You can put as much luggage as you want and youll be given a ticket for each piece of luggage. When you get off the coach allow the driver to empty out all the luggage first then he will ask for your ticket. Be patient they are very quick. Shibuya excel is the last stop so you wont get lost, as the coach announcement speaks in english. There are about 3 stops all in all, and theres a toilet on the coach.When you get off the limo, the entrance is directly in front of you around 100 metres, walk through the doors pass the toilets on the left and turn right after the vending machines and your in the main lobby and the reception desk can be seen. This is actually the 5 floor of the building and if you want to go to street level you'll just get the elevator down. -Checking injust give them your passport and let them do the rest. We arrived at 12:00 and were allowed to check in early by a very nice staff member. -staffAs i said earlier they all speak english and are very helpful. -RoomRoom has a flat screen tv, table and chairs, bedside remote control for lights and aircon.Daily supply of razors, earbuds, shower caps, toothbrushes and toothpaste, face flannel.House keeping stops at 3pm and you have to ring them after 11 to have your room cleaned before 3pm. Normally they phone your room if you have the don't disturb sign up, to confirm if your want your room cleaned or not.-Family friendlyOf course, japanese people do have children too,lol So yes you do see parents with buggies and baby slings in and around the hotel. Even the department stores have their own children buggies that you can use.-LocationYou are so central its unbelievable, The train station is beneath your feet and mark city department store are all attached to the same building. Shibuya hotel occupies 5th floor upwards. -Food there is a vending machine and ice machine on each floor. Dont be silly enough to just room service at those prices, when you've got so many cheaper options on your doorstep.Being muslim in a non muslim country you may think that halal food is hard to find, but think again. *Halal meat is the meat of an animal over which the verbal sentence ""In the name of God"" was said before the animal was killed for the intention of eating. Muslims seeking halal meat just go look out for any kebab shop, the are owned by muslim turkish people and the chicken in halal. Also there is are a couple of indian restaurants (eat as much as you can rice and nan!) called Samarat, they are within 5 mins walk from opposite the hotel, near centre gai. Walk down the street of the big Adidas shop its at the street of the side entrance of tokyo hands just for this address if you cant find it. The address is: KIRAKU Bldg.,B1.,29-2, UDAGAWA-CHO, SHIBUYA-KU, TOKYO. Phone: 03-3770-7286 -OPEN EVERY DAY-FROM : 11:00A.M.～11:00P.M.But i didn't come to japan for dirty kebabs and curry, although i did indulge a couple of times. I came for the sushi and noodles, yeahhh bruv! If you think youve been eating sushi in the UK, then think again, because japan sushi is on a different level. The freshness of the fish is the first sensation that enters the mouth. If you aint had sushi in japan then you aint had sushi, game time my friend! Noodle bars every where, dont be scared of the locals, just man up and go in sit down and order. Or just point to some thing that makes your mouth water, they have these plastic models of the food on offer. And the food actual comes out looking like it. Learn some basic japanese words, like fish, no pork, vegetarian it will prove to be most helpful for you.also Mark city the building of your hotel has an amazing food court in the basement B1, just go to the street floor level and get the escalators down to the b1 floor. And note that after 8:00pm most foods are reduced!!! sushi every ting. Look to spend roughly from £3 -£ infinity, it just depends on your budget. A bottle of coke is around £1.30p and a bar of chocolate is about £1 in 7/11's and family mart (the japanese 7/11. From whale meat to octopus balls its here in shibuya. -NappiesYou can find nappies just ask for diapers in the toddler section of the Toyku department store.-money exchangethere is a bank downstairs on your left just before the shibuya crossing, go in and get the lift to the second floor which is the money exchange floor to change your money to Yen. Also you can exchange in the airport, youll have to fill in a piece of paper wih the amount yo want to change then had it to the cashier.Thats it im done, too much just get yourself to JP, shibuya excel hotel.

Travelling with a friend, I did not expect us to be sharing a small double together for the night. I informed reception of the mix up, to which I got a response 'a lot of people think its two doubles, but it is in fact a smaller than average single double'. They were not prepared to rectify this without charging a considerable amount more to upgrade. The room was small and old fashioned. None of the nice extras you would expect when paying this much for a hotel.

I'll make a short review of what in our opinions are the strong and the weak points of this hotel:Pluses:1. Perfectly connected with the airport - limousine bus (www.limousinebus.co.jp/en/) stops right at the hotel - no reservations are made for the arrival - we purchased the tickets directly from the airport but for the return the reservation is mandatory - we just asked the lady at the hotel's reception one day in advance to help us and she called the company. Also very convenient that all luggage is managed by the hotel from the hotel to bus and we didn't have to look after the kids and trail the suitcases as well2. Perfectly connected with subway and JR lines as the hotel itself occupies floors 5-25 from the building and the Shibuya station is on the 3rd floor. Commutation to all the places we visited was as easy at it can be in a city of Tokyo's size.3. very vivid location as Shibuya is busy all the time, whole streets of restaurants opened late in the evening, shops and crowds of young people, some of them dressed in the Harajuku-style, so quite spectacular4. Pleasant and helpful staff5. Spectacular views over Tokyo from the A Bientot restaurant on the 25th floor, where the western style breakfast buffet is servedMinuses:1. Furniture and bath a bit dated2. Small rooms and no baby cot available for our 3 year old - we have ask for one upon making the reservation, but the hotel had only baby cots for up to 2 year olds - apparently would not hold an older baby. In the Kyoto hotel we stayed for the next week it was not a problem to arrange for the baby cot.3. No free wi-fi - actually this is valid for all places we traveled in Tokyo and Kansai - quite a significant nuisance4. Breakfast was served in two alternatives, in two different restaurants- Japanese - with a set menu and Western - buffet. Since our kids would not really manage with the Japanese option, we went for the Western alternative which was mostly Western indeed, with no fusion dishes as we would have hoped while being in Japan. Also a drawback was an almost daily waiting queue to get to the breakfast table. The waiting was nicely managed though, with a long chain of chairs all facing the glass walls and the beautiful scenery over Tokyo and in the end was not really uncomfortable. A bit annoying was the lack of variation in the menu - every day mostly the same for the whole week.So all in all, we thought it was a perfect location, a nice hotel with kind and helpful staff.As of the program while traveling with kids, we tried to make half of the objectives for them and half for us and it worked well as long as we grouped things in the same area. For the kids we went in Odaiba to the Emerging Science and Innovation Museum (www.miraikan.jst.go.jp/en/) than we took the river trip on the Sumida river till Asakusa and Senso Ji Temple. From the museum there is a free bus that goes around Odaiba and stops to major attractions. So we took the bus till Seaside Park. We were lucky to catch the last boat (water bus) at 6.30 (we understood that in non-holiday season the last boat is around 5.15pm). The water bus schedule is onhttp://www.suijobus.co.jp/ We also went to the Roppongi Mori Art Museum which w found small but with exhibits of exquisite quality, to The Tokyo Museum of Modern Art - small and an unfortunate choice for us - far and mostly with common pieces of art (we understood the the collection is vast but only several pieces are on display at a time and we were not lucky in our opinion at least).Also for the kids we went to the Ueno zoo - pretty instructive since they were running an exhibition on the evolution of legs from fish to mammals. We found Shinjuku and Harajuku aquite outstanding from the architecture and people point of view.","Bucharest, Romania","Alina P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bucharest, Romania</strong>",43,3.0

We stayed at 9 hotels over a three and half week trip to Japan, Thailand and Cambodia. I personally have been to Tokyo three times before and stayed at 4 hotels at varies areas of Tokyo. This was the most expensive hotel that we stayed in ($350+ a night) and by far the worst. The service was horrible. No one welcomed us when we arrived. No one offered to take our bags when arrived or when we were leaving to catch our taxi to Narita. When we asked them to help us arrange transportation to Narita, they were less then helpful and very rude. They did not show us to our room. When we explained why we were disappointed with the service to the receptionist, she did little more than say that she was sorry in perhaps in a incredibly disingenuous manner.The room was tiny, which is not the surprising for Tokyo, but was ridiculous for the price. It was also filthy. We found hair in the sink and in the bathtub. Also, the furniture and appliances in the room reminded me of a Super 8 or a Best Western here in the States. I am not sure if the air conditioning was broken, but it was about 85 degrees in the lobby and probably about 90 in our room.The only real benefits of this hotel is that it has a view of Shibuya and it is right next to Shibuya station. However, there are plenty of hotels next to metro stations and depending on what you intend to see in Tokyo, there are a lot of hotels next to more convenient metro stations. Additionally, the view we had from a our room was ok at best. Shibuya is kind of like Times Square except less touristy and trashy, so if that is what you want to see then maybe this hotel is for you. But, you can have better views of Tokyo in nicer more convenient areas, with cleaner rooms, much better service and at half the price.I will be returning to Tokyo, but I will certainly not be returning to this hotel.","Richmond, Virginia","rhdb83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",0,2.0

We normally avoid large hotels, but on this occasion we weren't disappointed. You can literally walk directly from Shibuya station across the overpass to one of the many entrances to the hotel (Tip: look out for the small signs and markings on the floor near elevator entrances, some of which we overlooked initially). Note that the lobby is on the 5th floor. On arrival we were offered a room upgrade for a small sum - which we were happy we agreed to - the room was 6 metres larger, huge by Japanese standards and had a king size bed which was pure luxury after sleeping on a futon for a few days! The room was clean and comfortable - and had an excellent view - but really, in this case, it's all about convenience and location. Walk straight outside into the midst of everything. And the airport limousine arrives and departs directly from this hotel every day, which is an added bonus. For the price, it can't be beat!

The check-in process was quick and easy, with the staff being polite, friendly and also a good command of english. Our room was upgraded from a semi-double room to a premiere (or excel premiere) double to our surprise our room was quite small (but large for Tokyo standards from what we were told) but nicely furnished. The room included a flat screen tv, desk/dresser (which are not included in some Tokyo hotel rooms) and a couple of chairs and a table next to the window from where we were able to look over the famous Shibuya crossing from the 22nd floor with views of the park where Meiji-Jingu shrine is located and the Shinjuku buildings in the distance (quite a sight at night time).The location of the hotel isn't very central as it is quite far from some neighbourhoods: Ginza and Akihabara for example (is there a central location in Tokyo?) however the close proximity to the JR Yamanote line and the Tokyo Metro station and also the simplicity of using the trains make up for this. Also the hotel is located just above a shopping complex - Mark City and also not far from a great food hall in the basement of Tokyu department store which adjoins Shibuya metro station. The surrounding area stays up late and there are large number of eateries, coffee shops and well known stores ie Uni Qlo, Don Quixote, Tokyu Hands some open till very late (some 24 hours) which was very convenient.The cleanliness of our room could not be faulted and was serviced everyday to a high standard. There was also a vending machine on our floor selling bottled water, beers and soft drinks which came in very handy. The hotel concierge was very helpful and was always able to help with our queries, all the staff that we dealt with were able to speak english (at various levels) but there no communication problems.All in all a good experience, nothing too fancy but modern, neat and tidy - great if you are sight seeing.

It gives good access to JR rail lines (handy if you have a JR rail pass) and the subway, and it's one of the stops on the limosine service from the aiport, so is very easy to get to. It's also in a brilliantly lively area packed with shops, restaurants etc. The hotel itself was a high end business hotel. We stayed in two rooms because we broke up our stay, and both were excellent. Large, big beds, and the most comfortable pillows I've ever slept on.

The Excel is in an absolutely prime location just on the corner of the famous Shibuya crossing, and is directly opposite an entrance to the train station. Near the Hachiko entrance, which is lovely in itself. You are supposed to pat the statue's head for luck, I think!The Excel has great views, helpful staff, exceptionally clean rooms, and an exciting location- you'll never run out of things to see and do, and eat...We were allocated a room on the top floor, which was a definite upgrade from the one we had booked. It was huge, with 3 double beds and a separate toilet and bathroom- very handy when sharing with someone who takes a long time in the shower!The top floors of the hotel can only be accessed by using special security cards in the lift, which enhanced the feeling of safety and security. Glass lifts provided great views of the crossing and a soccer field on the top of a neighbouring building! Internet was available in the hall area near the lift, and the vending machines were well stocked with basics, coffee, water and beer.The only thing I found confusing was finding the hotel itself, as it's not very well marked. The entrance is located on the street level of the Shibuya Mark City building, and you enter an enclosed area and access the lift to the lobby from there.

The location can't be beaten as there were heaps of places to eat and shopping was on our doorstep. The train station was directly across from the Hotel. which meant we could active our JR pass from Shibuya Station. The Hotel staff were great.

The hotel location is superb, adjacent to the famous Shibuya Crossing and opposite Shibuya station with access to the Ginza and JR Yamanote lines . Our room at 30m2 was large by Japanese standards and was modern in style, nothing spectacular but perfectly nice and unlike some previous reviews did have a LCD tv. Other features were free internet access, superb views of the Tokyo skyline as well as the bedlam below and a fridge for storing your own drinks (there is also a ice machine on each floor for guest use). There is a restaurant (pricey) on the top floor and a cafe at lobby level which seemed popular but we chose to eat out so cant comment on them. There are so many restaurants in the area your really spoilt for choice, for breakfast there is a patisserie and cafe one floor down from the lobby and a starbucks 2 floors down as well as many coffee shops in the immediate area. We found the staff spoke good english and were very helpful when I needed emergency dental treatment after breaking two fillings during a horrendous flight over to Japan, getting me an appointment within one hour of asking!.

You can also use the metro to get to the fish market and emperor palace and Ginza (excellent Leica shop there called Lemon ?).Food: There is a food court at bottom of hotel so you can grab some great food for lunhc/dinner and eat out in a park or back at the room overlooking the tokyo skyline. Best Tip: there is a Okanomiyaki (japanese/korean pancake) place down the road that has a great lunch special = pancake, noodles and miso for 700yen which is a steal and probably the best meal in the area unless you like fermented bean curd soup or really bad interpretations of western fast food. The pancake place is strait accross at teh major shibuya crossing then take the path that forks to the left - past the back of HMV and past mcdonalds.

When it came down to it, we figured that if we were going to stay in Tokyo we wanted to right in the middle of things. When I realised that the Shibuya Excel was ON the center gai, I knew I had to stay here! As we had never been to Japan, we decided to catch the limousine bus directly to the hotel, which was great after a long flight. The hotel is a little hard to find, as it is a shopping mall/train station. We didn't speak to the front desk a great deal, just handed over my expedia confirmation and passport and that was it. We stayed on the 24th floor in an Excel twin which was very nice. The room was spotless and was about 30m2 which is pretty decent for a Japanese hotel room. It is a secure floor and you can only get up to it by using your room key in the elevator. The hotel was extremely quiet and we barely saw anyone else on our stay. The free adsl in the room was also a plus, just plug in the provided ethernet cable and away you go!We had a view of the other side of the city (not over the crossing) which was still pretty cool seeing as we were 24 floors up. We could still see the rooftop soccer field, which is located across the road. The lift area overlooks the crossing so every morning and night we would get a good look of the lights and activity going on below. And if you are lucky 1 of the lifts is clear and gives you a good view.We thoroughly enjoyed Shibuya and everything is a few minutes walk from the hotel which is great. Just head across the crossing and you'll find heaps of places to eat, clothing stores and multi-level malls. We deliberately walked into restaurants we couldn't understand and ended up having some amazing meals esp. okonomiyaki. If you decide to head to Harajuku, Shinjuku, Ginza etc, all of the main train lines pass through Shibuya and as the hotel is on the train station, it is easy to explore Tokyo.For the location alone, I think that the hotel was good value. Right in the heart of Shibuya and minutes on the train away from Shinjuku and Harajuku makes it great location for a holiday to Tokyo.

The room we stayed in has been updated, the shower and bath are separate to the toilet, the setup is four single beds with two being king singles. The room is not gigantic (bigger then the other rooms located on the same floor), had enough room for a table in the middle with four chairs and the room was very clean. I found the beds extremely comfortable and my stay excellent and even with the crossing and nightlife it was extremely quiet.The service was very polite and efficient, however they were very strict on the 2pm check- in but held our luggage until then. We were located on 10th floor at the end of the hallway near the emergency exit which was non-smoking and my suggestion is to try for the 18th (also non-smoking) as you will be able to see the large crossing. However, if you were like us and out exploring each day then it really does not matter which floor as you get an excellent view of the crossing going down the elevators nearest the windows. There is a Starbucks just around the corner once you get out at the 3rd Floor which does yummy ham and cheese rolls and also ideal for a quick breakfast before heading out to explore. The hotel is located in Mark City which also has many restaurants and is joined to Shibuya railway station which underneath is a Food hall with a great selection of bakery items as well as other food alternatives. Japan has got into a big way into pastries and bread. Location wise for transport is fantastic. There is a Limited Express that goes to and from the airport without changing at Tokyo or Shinagawa which we discovered after arriving, but took going back. It has many different lines but no Shinkansens run out of here. For dinner we found a fantastic Yakiniku and really friendly staff at Han Daidokoro (Han's Kitchen) To get there from the hotel cross over at the crossing opposite the 109 Building and then walk straight up Dogenzaka till you reach an escalator with AM/PM Shop (small mini market) and head up to the 4th floor.

I selected the hotel because, based on my research (including hours on Tripadvisor), the Excel was one of the only hotels in Tokyo that offered a quad room. Tokyo is an expensive city, so I did not want to pay for two rooms if I could avoid it.We were very pleased with this hotel. It is not luxury. The Narita Express bus line does drop off passengers at a bus stop in the hotel complex rather than at the enterance to the hotel (so we endured the 5 minute walk). The television was a big old tube style model. The soap and shampoo are provided in big industrial pump canisters that are obviously not changed with each guest. The towels are pretty thin and the amount was insufficient for a family of four. The decor is fairly old and minimalist.But these issues are minor. The room was set up in a quite unique manor. There were two twin beds arranged with a night stand in between on each side of the room, with a table and chairs in the middle (somewhat akin to a dorm room). Each ""side"" had its own large window overlooking the bright lights of Shibuya, but with blackout curtains so sleeping was not an issue. There was a large closet, and the toilet was in a different room then the vanity and shower, which was convenient for 4 people.The location is amazing, as discussed in numerous prior reviews Nothing further needs to be said on that issue.What was quite unexpected considering the experiences of prior reviewers was the exceptional service that we received from the front desk. Aside from check in and check out which were flawless, the front desk provided exceptional information in regard to visiting a sumo school (which was the highlight of my trip). They ensured that it was open and available, and provided detailed directions, including providing the address in Japanese so the taxi driver outside the subway station could easily understand it. They provided detailed subway instructons so we could easily travel from place to place. They provided complete and accurate instructions on getting to and from Disney on the train. They called a restaurant owned by one of the famed ""Iron Chefs"" to see if the man himself was going to be there (he wasn't, unfortunately). They procurred last minute reservations at a popular Roppongi reataurant. They arranged our return transportation to the airport. The assisted us in obtaining information to go to a baseball game (a great experience).As stated in previous reviews, the hotel is located in a mall. We found that to be no problem and, in fact, the easy choices for a quick breakfast and evening snack with 2 kids in tow was welcome. As was the easy access to the Shibuya train station. Although there have been numerous comments about the size of the station, have no fear. There is a manned ticket counter at the enterance to the station from the mall, and every train is color coded. Just follow the signs. As we are trying to ""train"" our kids in the ways of travel, we let our kids lead the way in the train station, and even our 7 year old had no problem simply following the colored signs.My family and I cannot thank the front desk staff enough for making our Tokyo adventure a huge success. The last time that I was in Tokyo (sans kids) I stayed at the New Otani. This location is much better, and the Excel is far more family friendly.It is not world class luxury, but we received a quad room for less then most Tokyo hotels charge for a double, and we were treated to exceptional service.Arigato, Excel.","Los Angeles, California","bagoda1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",205,4.0

Reservations was actually handled by local Japan office. I got a deluxe room which is a bit larger than the normal room according to the floor plan. Check in was fine and the room is fine. I didn't get a room that faces the crossing but that was alright. The room itself was nice. Large LCD TV, standard queen bed with a sofa and small desk. Bathroom was surprising large compare to other Hotel's I've stayed at in Japan. The toilet wasn't heated but had all the other electronic stuff on it.Only odd thing was the soap dispenser. They were the large industrial size pump bottle. One next to the sink and two in the shower. In the shower, one was shampoo and the other was conditioner. Since they are the large industrial size, I don't think they replace when people check in/out. Only when empty. I find that odd since I find Japanese people are very particular when it comes to personal hygiene and germs.The location of this hotel is key. It is right on top of Shibuya station. As other have noted, it faces the busiest crossing in the world. It's a sight to see. Even if you don't get a room that faces the crossing, there are windows next to the elevators that overlook the crossing. I'd spent some time just looking at the crossing at night. Since the hotel is in Shibuya, there are lot of places to eat and things to see.Close by there are several clubs and ""love"" hotels. Right across the street, there are plenty of shopping and restaurants. For Harley Davis fans, there is a Harley dealer/store close by. My co-working had to go there to pick up T-shirts.There is one slight warning I want to give that I think hasn't been mentioned before. Although the airport bus from Narita does stop at the hotel, there is no porter / bell hop at the main drive way. It's hard to explain but the airport bus doesn't stop in front of the hotel but at a bus stop. The bus stop is not on the street but sort of on the property of the hotel. You have to carry your baggage into the lobby of the hotel from the bus stop before you see actual porter / bell hop. The actual distance is not far at only about 100M or so. To take the bus from the hotel to Narita, you can call the front desk before check and tell them you are taking the airport bus. They will send a porter to collect your baggage and make sure it gets on the bus.Overall, it is a great location and fine place to stay while in Tokyo.","cypress, california, usa","patrickf88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>cypress, california, usa</strong>",33,5.0

They put us in a 9/F smoking room facing a huge flashing neon sign. The room stank of smoke and that flashing neon sign drove us bonkers. I requested something else and they put me onto the 15/F, still a smoking room but a bit better without the neon sign flashing all night. I can still smell the smoke thru the sheets and on all the upholstery.The next day, the front desk said they found me a non-smoking room on the 10/F, right in front of that flashing neon sign again.

So, obviously there are floors higher than the 10/F that are non-smoking; they just don't want to give it to me. I said I don't need a Quad, I just wanted to get a room that I paid for. All that arguing just to get close to what I had booked originally!So we settled in what is actually a 2-bed suite with the sofa converted to a bed and a temporary bed added. The extra beds actually stick out into the entrance. They called it a Quad but we didn't bother to argue, we just wanted to get on with our holiday. For two days, we spent in that so called Quad and we're fine. Then on the third day, we came back in the evening to find they had changed the converted bed back into a sofa and removed the fourth set of amenities! I called the front desk and ask them to return the setup we had before. They sent 2 guys from the front desk to argue that I've only booked for a Triple and that's what I'm getting. I told them I'm fine with getting a triple but it's their manager that gave us the Quad setup, now they're going back on their word?Anyway, we finally got our Quad setup back but only after much argument. I really don't need this! Throughout the ordeal, the staff were courteous but were so inflexible. I don't think they meant to screw this up so badly but lying about not having a higher non-smoking floorsand not communicating about the Quad offer to their fellow staff surely doesn't help their cause. It's like no one can deviate from the play book. They never even offer a breakfast or something to compensate for us having to spend the first night in a smoking room.

There is no doubt that the location, right in the heart of Shibuya, is fantastic. The rooms have some amazing views - well at least mine did, looking out towards Shibuya crossing. However, the rooms are on the small side, and the bathrooms are, frankly, tiny. I am not a fan of the ""shower over the bath"" type of arrangement. The bed was Japanese style futon like, and was very very comfortable. Good free wired internet service, which is excellent - although wireless would have been a nice. The rooms, and the overall hotel are of course very very clean. The controls for the lights etc all work and are easy to use, and well positioned by the bed. The service is good (as one would expect in Japan)- but nothing particularly special.Some problems:- The hotel has no gym or pool - and that's a huge negative for me. - My rate included breakfast at one of the restaurants on the 25th floor (western of Japanese). The restaurants are tiny, and just can't cope with the volume of visitors - there is often lines waiting for a table. On one day I missed breakfast, as the wait was 20 minutes, and I didn't have that amount of time to spare. - The western breakfast isn't very good - there is a weird combination of foods - no fresh made toast, but lots of danish etc but potato wedges and mini Kit Kats ! The quality of other foods isn't very good either - they bacon is just nasty. Would I stay there again - probably not, I would look for a place with a gym and/or pool.","Melbourne, Australia","pommie01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",85,3.0

The buffet western-style breakfast doesn’t disappoint, with lots of hot food choices along with fresh fruit, pastries and bread.The rooms are small but very modern, and require the presence of a key card to activate electricity and air conditioning in the room -- a bit of a hassle when the temperature outside is approaching forty degrees celsius!

Had a quad room which is sooooo hard to find in Tokyo and this was perfect. Their little mouths dropped as they look upon the city lights with amazement from our room on the 15th floor. We could see a rooftop soccer game in play, huge numbers of people crossing at the major intersection, and a vibrant city in action. The room was just fine for us and the reality of the place is somewhat better than the photos. The shots look a little clinical and cold, but believe me, we were very happy to be here. I had considered The Mandarin and the Ritz Carlton but this place just had everything that was important to my decision. Front desk - easy check in and helpful, excellent location, clean rooms with the perfect combination for us, great shopping and restaurants. Great access to subway and rest of Tokyo. Children loved riding up and down in windowed elevators looking at the sites of the area. From Shinjuku to Yoyogi, and all over. Couldn't have been happier and paid so little for the desired effect. Surely stay there again. Great introduction to Japan, subway culture, corporate culture and shopping culture.

""Love Hotel Hill"" is also nearby if you want to take a ""break."" The room was quiet despite Shibuya Crossing being just 8 floors below. Beds are comfortable.",Orlando,"wachifield</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando</strong>",37,4.0

It was OK value about £90 a night, pretty good/average for a tourist/buisiness hotel in Tokyo.The location was perfect and my room on the 20th floor overlooked the famous crossing that most people remember from Lost in Translation and had a fabulous view of the city but the room or hotel wasnt at all noisy.As I was travelling on my own I choose to stay on the women only floor (allthough the city is v safe so it wasnt really necsecery) which costs no more but has key card entry to the floor and apprently more ""feminine rooms"". My room was very clean (and I am very fussy!!)and the size fine with an good size/clean bathroom and a duvet on the bed so none of the horrible sheet and blanket thing that a lot of hotels have!Mini bar at usual okish prices and TV with CNN and BBC news etc and good air con, not too noisy.So after a long flight it was a great room to collapse into and relax.Breakfast which I ate in hotel once was OK ish but not cheap and to be honest with several (dare I say it and its v bad I know but cant beat a tall skinny latte!) Starbucks nearby it was easy and cheaper to grab a latte and Muffin!So hotel good, views great BUT location amazing! bang in the heart of Shibuya with great shops and places to eat, right on top of the station and you really feel that you are in the heart of things and its really easy to get around and see some of the amazing places.The Limosine bus(normal coach)goes from the airport straight to hotel and only costs £15, its easy if a bit boring 90min journey. I would definetly reccomend staying here.Have Fun......",London UK,"kittytravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London UK</strong>",17,4.0

Location is great as the hotel is on top of Shibuya station with direct access to the station itself.Shibuya is on the other hand a cool location full of bars, restaurants and pubs, it's basically a young people's neighbourhood and is always crowded, so if you're looking for a quiet place, this is isn't it!My room was OK, not large but not small, comfortable. I didn't spend much time in it as I was the whole day visiting clients, but it was OK. The bathroom was OK in size and the room was very clean too.I had western style breakfast the whole week and it was plentiful and good.I will definitely return to this hotel in my next business trip :)Ahh...and the elevator view is simply spectacular!!","Madrid, Spain","Chispito</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madrid, Spain</strong>",49,4.0
