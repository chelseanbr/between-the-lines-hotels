I like that it comes with a Japanese style buffet breakfast but the last entry is at 9.30 am, a little earlier than the usual 10 am. If you are already in there before 9.30 am, you can continue to eat. The room is on the smaller side but enough for one person. And I like the bathroom, which is a good size. There is a small bathtub, good separate shower and of course the Japanese style toilet with music and all. All the basic amenities are provided; kettle, tea/coffee, there is also a trouser presser? But I prefer a proper iron so I requested one from the reception. The location is also convenient, not too far from the subway and is also on the quieter side. There is no gym at the hotel, but you want to be out and about when you are in Tokyo. The check- out is also easy with a kiosk, which you just have to insert your key card.

The shower is powerful and efficient. The A/C is very responsive and efficient. There are multiple USB power outlets spread all over the room so there will be no problem to charge your devices. The beds are quite firm as is the pillows.I read a review about mold and moisture in the bathroom, we experienced nothing of that. Water bottles can be purchased in the 7-eleven store in the building. The room is quite small by international standards but very normal for Tokyo. The breakfast is also very nice with a mixture of western food like scrambled eggs, sasuage, bacon, bread, yoghurt and asian food like dumplings and Japaneese specialities. A chocolate fountain was also available for sweet lovers... The location is perfect.

You left Sydney with a child who went sick on you in the terminal, a flight to Hong King with a 7hr stopover, redeye flight to Haenada arriving at 5am and you have to wait until 1pm to check in. Leavves you pretty buggered and with an unwell child, more so than usual. Your hotel checks you in a bit earlier, which is really nice, then your 3 person room (2 adults, 1 Child as booked on booking.com) turns out not to be the one in the picture with a double and a single bed, but a tiny room with a double bed. ""Yes, that is the room you booked."" said the desk staff. Both the wife and I chekced and rechecked when we booked some months earlier and this was not the room or arrangement. What we were about to learn was a lesson in misleading customers by ommision, from both a hotel chain and booking.com. Which really dissapointed us no end as I liked the look of this hotel, and it was new. What I can't review here is the facilities, rooms, resurraunt or location as we didn't stay there. What I can review is the staff - polite, even whilst caught between their employer, the manager who wouldn't support them and booking.com who lost them business and left them to deal with angry customers.They did get a booking.com rep on the phone who basically didn't care and had no interest or empathy, for either the hotel or ourselves. They approached the hotel manager repeatedly at our request, who would not come out of the office to see us, leaving it to the desk staff. I feel for the staff, but we chose not to spend money with two orgainsations that would treat us so poorly after miselading us.Here is what unfloded. We used booking.com to find suitable accomodation at a good price, choosing this hotel. We completed the search fields with 2 adults and 1 child (under 8). The room we chose showed a double and a single bed and the details indicated it was suitable for 3 persons. We toook the breakfast option, chose ""pay at the hotel"" and confirmed. After booking, the hotel took full payment immediately form the card and then informed us that there was an additional breakfast charge for our child. This taking of payment was a bit rude, the demand for the extra breakfast fee was very rude, but the room was the rudest insult of the lot, only to be follwed by the abonination at the front desk. Now, whilst our issue was going on, there was another family going through the same issue over their 17 year old. We also saw it again at another hotel! 3 times in one day and all booking.comSo what was the cause? Several major failures in booking.com's process that I now think are there to trap customers. You see, we found out that in Japan, they considder that your child will share the bed with you, so they do not charge you for the child, just for the additional breakfast. Booking.com and other booking websites don't tell you this, nor do they tell you that younger teens are considdred and adult and that if you want your child in a sperate bed, you must book them as an adult and pay for them as an adult. We found only one Japanese hotel that stated this upfront and it was the Hilton chain, only on thier own website. So, what did we do, we pulled our book, got a refund in full with no cancellation fees, retired to a coffe shop up the road and found another hotel. We did spend the extra money to get a bed for our child and decided that we were not going to use Diawa Roynet hotels for Koyto or our return to Tokyo. We have now cancelled all emails and membership of booking.com, will no longer use them ofr personal or business travel and will be reporting them to NSW Fair Trading so that they are forced to enact a full fees disclosure. ie: That when they show you a price based on your search criteria as an Australian user, that price is the final price, as is done in the EU.

The room was well equipped, with air conditioning, an air purifier, a TV with a selection of movies, a good sized bathroom with both a rain shower and bath.

The hotel is very new, opened in February. It is the most stylish of all the DR Hotels I have stayed in, a very attractive look, and there are many smart and thoughtful touches to be found in the hotel.Room 1215 is on the front of the hotel, facing east. It has twin double beds, a kind- of two- part couch, coffee table, large desk with a good task light, large TV, mini- fridge, In- room safe, coffee and tea service and trousers press. The desk also has two mains outlets and a USB charge point, very convenient.The bathroom is very modern and bright. The shower and tub are separated and in a glassed- in room next to the sink – and there’s a shower wand and a rain shower – plus, warning signs by the thermostatic control valve, so you don’t get surprised by water suddenly coming down from the rain shower overhead when you were expecting the wand to be the thing spouting water…The window is floor- to- ceiling and does not open, but the aircon works well and the controls are intuitive.The bedding is high- quality and very comfortable. Next to the bed are two USB charge points, two mains outlets and controls for the room lighting. Like some other DR hotels, the TV has real- time information on the status of the laundry machines and the breakfast queue – no need to go down the elevators only to find that you have to wait. Very smart.Breakfast is on 1F in a very nice space with lots of glass. Like other DR hotels, they have let the space to a commercial restaurant, who also do the hotel’s breakfast for them. It’s a clever idea – why have a space just for breakfast when it can also serve two other mealtimes as well? The food variety and quality are excellent, and it has a really fine cappuccino – espresso maker. GREAT! This “lease it” strategy also works well for the guest, as the spaces are more attractive and the food more varied from one site to the next.The hotel lobby is very attractive; the designer did a great job. There’s a 7-11 on B1F, you can enter it directly from the hotel. A convenient konbini, if you will.The Marunouchi Line’s Nishi Shinjuku Station is 350m away, the Toei Oedo Line’s Tochomae station is 730m away, and Shinjuku Station is a tad over 1km away from the front door to the west entrance gates. IMHO, it is not worth it to transfer to the Marunouchi Line from Shinjuku Station. There are some really good little restaurants in Nishi Shinjuku – but I fear that with so many buildings – indeed, a whole block just a bit west - coming under the wrecking ball, their existence is threatened. I hope not, I want to keep returning to this hotel.",Munich,"MunichEricJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Munich</strong>",486,5.0

For a hotel they should be able to speak a lot more english; this resulted in misunderstandings a few times; they could also make more efforts to be welcoming and helpful- the room is very small especially compared to the bathroom ; it would have been nice to have the space used a bit more for the room rather than the bathroom - the bed mattress is very very firm.

Easy to arrive from Narita - just get to Tokyo station then hop on the Marunouchi subway line. The pulsing beat of Shinjuku & Kabukicho are not far away at all but there are heaps of restaurants & convenience stores clise to the hotel as well so both options are covered.
