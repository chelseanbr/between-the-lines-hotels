The trip is supposed to be a trip for my partner’s birthday. Unfortunately due to the virus outbreak, our flight got cancelled and so does our trip. Nonetheless we really appreciate the service provided by the team. They have helped arrange several booking for the birthday celebration and they respond within the day with clear status update. This is so far one of the best I have ever experienced. Very sad that I’m not able to experience the good service in person. I would still like to thank them for the service provided. Hope everyone will stay safe and healthy during this difficult period.

The rooms are small, but everything is well thought through and arranged. (Not much storage space - but this is a city with high cost per square meter, so this is standard). Good bed, great shower. The (all day) coffee in the splendid lounge is high quality, and makes up for the fact that you only get one drink with breakfast (served in the adjacent cafe - not really part of the hotel, but very convenient and with a nice terrasse overlooking the street). The team at the reception is very professional and eager to help. Excellent English. There is a splendid rooftop bar, I ""inspected"" and have not been for a drink yet - but is looks very stylish. The location is also very good, lively, but not too much, lots of shops and restaurants. The metro is not that close, but if you travel light that should not be a major problem ( and is anyway advisable in view of the limited closet space in the standard rooms).
