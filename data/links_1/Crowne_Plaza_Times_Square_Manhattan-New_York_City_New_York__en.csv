I have not heard anything from the Crowne since submitting the form so really disappointed. My fault for leaving my purse and English cash but it would not hurt for a response.

At first sight the long queue for check-in did not offer much hope of seeing a bed for a couple of hours. The first of our surprises at the Crowne Plaza was how well organised they were. The queue moved astonishingly quickly and we were in our room inside 20-minutes. In New York City you can't expect large rooms but the one we had was more than adequate, clean and fresh.'Snack' time in the bar/restaurant in the lobby was surprise number 2. By NYC standards the prices are more than reasonable. By anyone's standards the portions were huge.Breakfast was the next surprise. An array of fresh fruit, cooked food, cereals and anything else you might want was all readily available in the buffet. Staff were on hand all the time should you need anything.Easy walk to the Christmas tree, Macy's and all the other stores as well as Broadway theatres so no complaints on location either.The only sour note was the imposition of a very heavy ""resort tax"" levied by most NYC hotel. We knew about it so no surprise but I am wary of locations that export their taxes, No difference, economically, to taxing their exports. Not the hotels fault but it makes for a black mark against New York.Having said that, if you have to go to New York City you won't be disappointed with the Crowne Plaza.","Brisbane, Australia","PaulSuncoast</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",18,4.0

This didn’t happen even though the hotel didn’t seem full but never mind, it was just one of those things.The room we did get allocated was extremely small for four of us but again, just one of those things.On our first night, we hardly got any sleep as the connecting door in our room to the room next door was constantly rattling. It sounded like there must have been a draft that was making it shake. However, we managed to resolve this ourselves by sticking two pieces of cardboard in it (as shown on the picture).The next day, we found that we didn’t have any hot water coming from the bath or shower. After trying for quite a while to get it hot by letting it run, we had no joy so informed reception on our way out.When we returned late that afternoon, it still wasn’t working and wasn’t even sure if anyone had even attended our room to attempt to fix it.After this it was reported another three times and there was only one time we were in the room when an engineer arrived, which was on the last evening. The engineer explained that to get the shower running hot you had to run the sink tap for 5 minutes and then run the bath tap for 5 minutes and then put the shower on and it will be warm. How ridiculous is that?? He seemed to think it was common knowledge of that is what you need to do?? Once the water in the shower was finally running warm, the pressure was terrible which meant the two of us who have very long thick hair were unable to wash our hair as the pressure was just not good enough.To not have hot water for 3 nights and 4 days of being in a hotel is totally unacceptable. The staff on reception were very polite each time we reported it but the service of actually getting it fixed was non-existent, until the engineer attended on the last evening to give us the instructions of how to get it warm.There were no drinks vouchers, or nothing waived from the resort fee, so it wasn’t great having to pay another £100 on check out for the hotel when we hadn’t even had hot water, which you would think is a basic requirement.On our previous visit 4 years earlier, we had no problems at all which was why we returned to the same hotel.Unfortunately, we won’t be staying at the Crowne Plaza when we next visit New York.",,Rach3lm,17,3.0

While the hotel discounted our stay by one night one in recompense, I really wish we’d stayed elsewhere. After arriving 23 Dec I found the shower cold in the evening which I reported. The same again on the 24 Dec on which day we reported it twice, followed by another cold shower on Christmas Day. We were finally moved after reporting it for the fourth time, to a smaller, noisier room opposite the lifts, with little help offered to move our belongings. The shower in the original room was also dirty with hair on our arrival. There was clearly no communication between different shifts on FOH and no communication with us about why the problem had not been rectified. Each and every time it was down to us to raise and no one followed up to ensure it had been fixed. Apparently attempts had been made to fix it but no one had bothered to communicate with us.

Let’s start this out on a very strong positive: the staff. Specifically, Grant, John and Krisch. I hope IHG knows what assets they are to these men as they are exactly the type of people they should strive to employ. I was pleasantly surprised by their extreme professionalism when assisting me. I didn’t expect a text to reach out to me checking in, seeing if there was anything they could do to make my stay better. Sure, being and IHG Gold Elite member ensures a little extra recognition but these are just great guys who know how to make you feel like you’re at a 5 star hotel even when you’re not. Speaking of not, the rooms really lack here. Unfortunately, the HVAC didn’t work and the room was mid 70’s as opposed to mid 60’s where we like it. We had several other troubles with the room, too. We would’ve traded rooms but my son was too tired to deal. The phone line to call Valet went right to voicemail and a full voicemail at that. For the extreme prices they charge to park, that’s frustrating. There is no real lobby as far as lots of seating for people watching, relaxing. Just the bar area. The adjacent restaurant has the advantage of having a front seat view of Times Square yet it’s a plain white room and empty..and closed often. So odd. The location of the hotel is certainly a plus. Near everything! The no-frills coffee grab-n-go area is well stocked with some delicious Italian coffee and very fresh croissants. No place to sit and eat which is ashame but really well made stuff and not awful price points, especially compared to the very high prices at the Broadway Bar. I really felt welcome here. It makes me want to come back. Until they update and repair the rooms, bathrooms specifically, I am thinking I may try another IHG run location for now but I am hopeful to return here at some point. Thanks again to the people who made sure I’ll never forget the Crowne Plaza to be a worthy option.

When we arrived at the hotel we couldnt believe how big it was with either an escalator or lift to take you up to the reception area. The hotel was lovely so modern and right in the heart of Times Square with fantastic views. We were on the 35th floor and the views were amazing. The room was so clean, modern and big. The rooms have black out curtains, are warm and the rooms are made up with clean bedding every day. Big TVs with hairdryers too. The beds are so big like super king size so we had a fantastic sleep all week. Fresh towels are put out in the bathroom each day and such a nice touch the complimentary small toiletries in the bathroom. The showers are so large and hot water so quickly. One day was so magical as it was snowing all day so the views from our room was amazing looking down from so high up. The hotel was lovely decorated all for Christmas and we ate in the hotel restaurant once and the food was nice. The bar area was extra special as some lovely views so sit near the front to look over Times Square. Lovely touch near the lifts was a food/drink area where you can buy wine, coffee and other refreshments, fresh danishes for breakfast, lunches like sandwiches and baguettes and salads, lots of yummy cakes. We took a couple of cheese board boxes to our room one day which was lovely and the hotel are very flexible if you take food back to your room which is nice from outside places. The concierge was extremely helpful and helped us book some sight saver passes which saved quite a bit of money and they helped out with us getting to and from places and provided maps too. When we checked out the receptionist asked when we were leaving and gave us some more free drink vouchers for the bar to get a drink each until our transfer picked us up directly outside the hotel for the airport which was very kind.

Rooms are HOT and the only way to cool them is to open a window. Yes, an open window in Times Square. It didn't pose that much danger for my children but with younger I'd be nervous. The sounds of the city didn't bother us but sirens can be loud and bother others. Also the staff isn't nice, at all. I had 2 separate reservations to cover the 10 nights and I was first told we wouldn't need to switch rooms, then we had to switch and in a hurry. We lost some stuff because we had to leave the room. The general manager was very rough and not interested in helping the situation. We were given a higher floor and TS view to compensate but their attitude was a definite turn off.

There are positives and negatives to being in Times Square though! Everything is at your fingertips but it’s more expensive, including every meal you’ll eat, and there’s lots of noise and crowds. I was here for work, and needed to be near the 1 train and the E train (to get to and from JFK’s AirTrain) so this fit the bill. Was the hotel clean and comfortable? Yes. Did I sleep well? Yes. They had free WiFi and a gym. But it was just average for me. It didn’t have some of the basic things I expect when I travel (I should say I usually stay at Marriotts). It didn’t have a mini-fridge, which would have been nice and seems to be almost a given. For the large size of the lobby, I was really surprised and disappointed that they only had a handful of chairs for guests to sit in. The hotel is 30+ stories, not sure how many guests it holds, but the only place to sit other than your room is in their bar/restaurant seating. To me that’s very inconvenient, especially if you are in town with a large group and you are waiting for people to assemble in the lobby. There were always just groups of people standing around, and I don’t know about you, but when I go to NYC I put on 15-20,000 steps a day, so I like to sit when I can . Another thing I thought was strange was that the shower water took a very long time to get warm. I called maintenance and the guy who came up told me I just had to run it for a long, long time and it might get warmer (doesn’t this go against their “sustainability goals”?) If not call back tomorrow and they would change the cartridge.... um why would I have to call back tomorrow? Put in a work order, that’s your responsibility not mine. I also requested that the ice maker on my floor get fixed, and he showed me that it was making ice but not spitting it out. He let me take as much as I wanted but I was told it wouldn’t get fixed, there were other things to do. Previously, the front desk people were apologetic about the ice and told me I could go up or downstairs... of course I can, and that’s why they are getting an average rating.

After great experience with Crown Plaza hotels around the world we werde expecting a prefect stay, as usual. Unfortunately it wasn't. The hotel has an ugly, dark lobby. Check-in was distant and it seemed we were disturbing. The we got the first room, which should have Times Square view. Well, the view was on the Times Square - if you press your face on the window. From the 40th level you don't really see anything but the windows of the opposite buildings. The other thing was the room itself: wallpaper came of the walls, bathroom was dirty, all furniture were damaged. The windows was not closing completely. The room was tiny and so was the bathroom. After complaining we have got a similar room on the 36th level with better view on Times Square. The furniture were not as much damaged as in the other room. The bathroom was cleaner, but the wallpaper dissolved of the walls.OK, there is one more good thing we can say about the hotel: the breakfast was good.The price-performance ratio was unacceptable.

We could walk everywhere from here, Times Square not ideal for everyone as it's so busy but this was our choice and we're glad we did. It's so close to all attractions/subway/buses etc and you really are in the heart of it all.We stayed 5 nights, had a lovely warm welcome at reception who gave us some vouchers to use in the bar/restaurant, had upgraded us to a room overlooking times square and arranged for a complimentary fridge in our room which was a welcome touch.The room was smaller than expected with 2 double size standard beds for 3 of us, including our teenage daughter. I would have expected king size beds but it was fine. A very small wardrobe, ok for a couple of nights but we struggled for space for 3 of us over 5 nights, we had to hang 3 or 4 things on each hanger.A good size bathroom and great shower.The room had fabulous views overlooking times square, we were on 44th floor out of 45! This did mean we could hear no noise.All the staff we came across at the hotel were very friendly and informative, they all went our of their way to help you and give you information on local attractions/ directions and other helpful tips.The hotel bar and restaurants always seemed busy, we did take advantage of our free drink, the service was great and the wine was excellent, a nice vibe and atmosphere in the bar.The room was cleaned every day and was spotless, all public areas also very clean.The lifts were always in good working order.My only disappointment was the check out, this was chaotic and we queued for over an hour to leave our bags with the concierge, this meant cutting into our time on our last day.Overall a great hotel, great staff, great location, great value and I would definitely stay again.","Macclesfield, United Kingdom","conrad169</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Macclesfield, United Kingdom</strong>",154,4.0

This trip was a sun-wed. I have always found the location convenient, the hotel clean and maintained, and the service good. However, this trip was a series of disappointments. There were 3 issuesFirst, on arrival at my room, I found myself disappointed in the cleanliness of the room. Crumbs and food debris on the desk, the floor had not been vacuumed, and there were water stains on the sink vanity. The worst feeling was when I opened the dresser drawers and found items and paper waste from the prior occupant. But the linens and towels were fresh and having had good experiences in the past, I thought I would wave it off and it would be cleaned the next day. I carry sanitizing wipes with me when I travel so I cleaned a bit myself. Unfortunately, it was not. For the entire trip housekeeping was way below par. While the bed was made, towels replaced, and the toiletries replenished, the floor continued to be an ongoing problem and surfaces were generally left uncleaned. Second, maintenance has been allowed to fall behind. The lamps had shorts and blinked if the table was bumped. Wallpaper was stained, paint chipped, etc. But the final straw was when a loud customer moved into the room next to me, others in his party in other rooms on the hallway. It went on with arguments, doors slamming, loud music, screaming, TVs blaring, etc. from 10:30 pm to 4:30 AM.I called the front desk, the line had been turned off for the night. I tried concierge, bell stand, housekeeping, lost and found, even room service. Every line either went to an answering machine or busy signal. I tried calling from my cell to the local phone number-busy signal. I called the 800 number for the chain, they put me on hold then hung up on me. This went on for hours. I finally called another IHG hotel on Times Square and asked for security and explained the scenario. To their credit they contacted the hotel and someone came up and told them to quiet down. Not fifteen minutes later they started back up with the noise. I tried all of the phones again- same problem - answering machines and busy signals. I finally went to the people’s doors and threatened each one with calling the police. They then settled down for the night. Needless to say, they have lost my business.","Algonquin, Illinois","johna389</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Algonquin, Illinois</strong>",6,1.0

More disappointing is the staff attitude, which is awful. Went to the bar to order a drink, only to be told to find a table from where I could order from and then wait over 30 minutes to actually place an order. This continued throughout my stay, again awful attitude, given the wrong bill. If you stay here, avoid restaurant and bar at all costs.Saying that the check in and check out process wasn’t much better, with staff attitude very disappointing.There is also the issue of the blatant con of charging over $35 a day for a gym you will probably never use, phone calls when you use your mobile and a one off free drink in the worst hotel bar I’ve ever been in.My advice is avoid.

The Crowne Plaza Time Square certainly fills that bill but unfortunately there were things that added up and distracted from what other wise was a wonderful trip.+On the positive side, the Crowne Plaza is perfectly situated on Broadway and 48th in the heart of mid-town. The property is impressive with a great bar that overlooks Times Square. The rooms fine and the sports center is terrific.However, the service lacked on several counts.1) Before arriving , we had trouble getting through to the front desk. I attempted to call the hotel directly to find out where to check in with a car. (including while on route) and finally was told to just pull in on Broadway. However , when we arrived we discovered that construction blocked entrence and it took 25 minutes driving around the block several times to find the unmarked entrance. The lack of information by the staff handling the phones, given the hectic Manhattan pace, was upsetting.2) The concierge desk was a joke. Either no one was there, or there was a long line or when you left a message which they promised to return they did not (three times) (Thank God for the internet.) Finally when I actually spoke with a concierge person, she was not helpful at all.3) In trying to get a cab to Brooklyn, after asking the doorman, we waited twenty minutes before being told that cabs didn't go there. Irked , I resorted to Uber and thank God, for they saved our reservation. Manhattan at Christmas time is magical and the hotel over all wasn't bad, it's just that even given the stress of the fully booked conditions, the communication with its guests about basic information should have been better.","Syracuse, New York","MHeathSyr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Syracuse, New York</strong>",22,3.0

My husband and I with our two grown up kids checked into the hotel and stayed for 5 nights. We booked two rooms through a third party operator and found out when we arrived that one of the rooms was cancelled. The first front desk officer who served us was not helpful. He said he could not do anything for us as the hotel was fully booked and asked us to talk to the third party operator. We tried to contact the third party operator but they also could not explain why one of our rooms was cancelled. We went back to the front desk and this time, another front desk staff, Donald served us. We repeated our predicament and explained that the third party operator could not help us. He showed empathy and helped us to check his records again and spoke to his manager (I think it was John) to see if they could reconfirm the guests list and see if there was anyway to free up a room for us. and promised to get back to us within an hour. We were informed within an hour that they have found another room for us but it was on a different floor. We took the room anyway, as we desperately need another room for the family. Without us asking, Donald offered to check if he could arrange for us to have rooms on the same floor the next day and even arranged for our luggage to be moved to the new rooms as we would be out the next day. As we had initially requested for a double bed room for our kids, they could only find a room with King sized bed. Donald offered to move in a roll in bed at no extra charge. That, I thought, was good service recovery.Unfortunately, when we checked out, we did not check the bill carefully as we were rushing to catch an early morning flight and found out later that we were charged for the roll in bed for all five nights after all. We did not mind paying for the rollin bed but I thought it was a good initiative at first but poorly executed. For one of the rooms, we also had problem with the bath room. The water took a very long time to get heated and it was very difficult to adjust the water temperature. We were glad to have met Donald and his manager who were really helpful.

I just can’t imagine how anybody could give it a good review. It wasn’t terrible but definitely not good. We just had one thing wrong after another. I came with my husband and 2 teenage daughters. Day 1 - We arrived early evening and decided to just eat in the hotel. The service was average and the food lukewarm. We ate it anyway as we were hungry. Not good enough for over $100 for a few burgers.The room was average (a little tired with beds that were too soft and had roll together). Day 2 - We got up really early as we only had 2 full days here and had 9am tickets to an attraction. We couldn’t shower as the water wouldn’t warm up. We called reception. It took 30 mins for somebody to come. The manager agreed to move our room and gave us some breakfast vouchers for the next day, a bottle of cava and some fruit. Day 3 - Again, up and out early after a very good breakfast (they got this bit right). After 8 hours walking, we got back to our room. It hadn’t been serviced. So we had a bathroom full of wet towels. We had to call and ask for fresh ones. The hotel did waive the service charge but we hadn’t been serviced anyway. So all in all, for our €470 per night we had:A room changeNo hot water in first room (in the end, after running for 10 minutes, it did warm up. Who waits 10 mins in a hotel to run the water before showering!)No room being serviced and coming back to make our own bed with damp towels.In a nutshell, the hotel is understaffed for how busy it is. There were 2 staff on reception. It took over 30 mins to check in and 30 to check out. The manager was nice to us and tried his best to make things right but he seemed resigned and used to the complaints. I will definitely visit NYC again as I love it.

We went back down and the guy would not accommodate us or make changes. After texting back and forth with an IHG rep, a manager finally called us. We explained the entire situation and she was very accommodating. She apologized for the behavior of her employees and moved us based on our request within ten minutes. The bellmen who helped us that day were the nicest people we encountered. They had big smiles and wanted to make sure everything was great. We gave generous tips to them for smiling and being so nice.Our day was made when we went to the bar and were served by Kim. She is always so nice and makes our day.

Imran also gave us our vouchers fro the free drink that comes as part of the resort fee and vouchers for a reduced rate breakfast as I am a Spire Elite member. This makes the Breakfast $16 each and is all inclusive. No issues with overcharging or wrong charging, everything was as expected.As I said a really easy location to sightsee from, a couple of blocks from the Rockerfeller Center, at the top of Times Square and so also easy access to the Hop on Hop off bus stops.Only a couple of niggles, the first was when I exchanged my free drinks voucher I was asked if I was taking the drink to my room. A ""Yes"" meant that although I was in a Crowne Plaza, I was taking drinks to my room in plastic tumblers.

I typically give around 120 nights business a year to IHG, as typically, their hotels are reasonable. I have stayed in hundreds of hotels in dozens of countries, so I have a good idea of the standard of such properties. From a Crowne Plaza virtually anywhere outside USA, you can expect good service and look nice, well appointed rooms. The staff I experienced in CP Times Square are, in general, rude and more so than the famous reputation that precedes this city. Check in was inefficient. The girl that checked me in was rude, with a zero ‘can do’ or helpful attitude. She told me I had my Spire benefits. Maybe that was her way of greeting me as a loyal guest. It certainly isn’t the way she was trained to greet her loyal guests, but then, like everything about this hotel, a half hearted effort is apparently enough. I was then handed a few vouchers for drinks and breakfasts, which didn’t even have my correct status printed on them. But ok, I can live with that. When I asked later in the stay if I could extend my check out, I was asked to pay a $75 fee. Then conveniently it ‘wasn’t on the system’ that I had status. I was charged a 15% tip on a rubbish $40 breakfast, because a rude and quite frankly lazy waiter poured a coffee and brought me the check. Don’t buy breakfast here, it’s pathetic, and for that money you can eat like a king across the road at Juniors. They sell it on the view, and in case you hadn’t noticed already, any building in Times Square with windows has a view of Times Square, even Starbucks, where an equivalent breakfast to the one I had cost $9, with better coffee and better food. Just a note - my voucher brought the rip off cost of a terrible breakfast to $16, but I was still charged a service fee on $40, which meant that breakfast for one person was still more than $21. Again, you can find good food on TS for Less or equal, but also service with a smile. Rooms are tired, dirty, poorly appointed, poorly maintained, noisy and old. I understand it is a high throughput hotel - so are many of their hotels where at least they make an effort to keep them looking good. A tip for you, fellow travellers, don’t look too closely at anything in the bathroom ;-) Then there was the water issue. Alex (Social Media Manager) - before you harp on that it was ‘out with your control’, don’t talk such nonsense. I bet you have a generator for when there is a power outage. I live in a country where all hot water is supplied to hotels cold. As it is in most of the rest of our world. There are solutions, and just because your overcharged property doesn’t invest in them, that isn’t ‘out with your control’. That’s ‘lack of planning and investment’ and ‘pure profiteering at the expense of your guests’.The one positive from this experience - there are many taxis around that will happily take you away from this dump.

Positive points: walking distance to subway and Times SquareNegatives? Let me count for you! (Read till the end as I have the worst part the last1- stains on the bed sheets2- soap scum all around the bathtub, and bath tile specially close to the shower standing area3- stain (probably from rusty soap dish) on the sink counter4- sticky black mark on a towel(Some towels look wrinkled, I’m not sure if they’re washed)5- the windows are not tight. You can literally put a hand in the gap. so you hear all the outside noise, as well as the breeze and the wind sound that comes in6- no ventilation in the room (I guess because there has been no need to put one with the faulty windows)7- the table lamp on the night stand has a primitive button and the light blinks and you don’t know that it’s on until it turns on automatically in the middle of the night! So you can’t basically use it8- the only thing you get at the room is a cheap no-name coffee machine with 2 paper cups (which if you use them they usually don’t put new ones back) and a pair of no-name coffee and tea bags to put in the machine. I’ve been to a holiday inn express once for a business trip and they had Keurig coffee machine with real pods! 9- the hotel has been out of hot water for 2 consecutive days so far, and I have contacted them at least 5 times so far. They’re not responsive. I’m still waiting for the hotel manager to contact me, as they offered, and I have not received a single phone call from even a concierge in the hotel! They say there’s a water breakdown in the NYC area that has caused the issue. This is unacceptable for me. Such huge hotel is expected to have a backup plan for any similar issue. What if you don’t have electricity? How can you live without hot water for 2 days??? You should have your own boiler, or hot water tanks or whatever it takes not to cause such problems for your guests! The weird thing is that they even don’t offer any type of compensation! They just sent a letter last night promising to fix the issue, and then another one in the middle of the night that the hot water will be back this morning not later than 6:45am, and as of now, 8:05am, there’s still no hot water.We’re here to stay for 9 nights for a family trip and both my husband and I have arranged for a couple of business meetings as well. We both went to our meetings unshowered yesterday and we don’t know how to appear in our meetings today!!! Briefly, we tried to be cool and don’t take the first 8 big negatives seriously as we wanted to have fun, but the last one and their irresponsibility, is not tolerated any longer.

She knew we were very set on improving our situation, but she said there was little she could do. We told her that we would go to another hotel and let her know if we found one. She understood and graciously agreed to waive the early departure fee of $100. We were able to get a room for our remaining 4 days a few blocks away at the Marriott Marquis. We went back to get our things and check out at the Crowne Plaza. Lots of renovations there, when we went back to get our things, the jackhammer had started so I hope they get things nicer there.

I choose this hotel as the price and location was attractive. In addition, I am a spire elite level member at IHG.Check in was relatively quick, but I can imagine with a large hotel and just three agents, I could see a long line. I mentioned to the check in agent, there is a special sign for elite IHG members, but no one manning the location. That’s a shame, and hopefully against corporate policy. The check in agent was a pleasure.The negatives I noticed the bed sheets were stained. I know, ugh. Few things are more troubling. I spoke to Heather who apologized and was sending a house keeping supervisor immediately. After waiting 20 minutes, I had to go to a meeting. I called again and spoke to Patrick who apologized and said a MOD would call that evening, and we set a specific time. NO CALL.That evening, we used our free drink coupons for wine and snacks. When we asked where the snack was, which was described on the coupon as nuts..., the waiter said we could go to the front desk for a package of pretzel. Yes, we were in the lounge with waiter service but we should get up to get a package of pretzel. Kind of shows you what service to expect at this hotel.While problems may occur, it’s how a property responds to these issues. This hotel just doesn’t seem to care. So far, two managers failed to respond. It gets worse. This hotel texts you if you are elite. I texted FIA to let her know no one ever responded and she said a manager would get back to me. AGAIN, three hours later, no response.I call AGAIN at 11am and John Acosta says the hotel failed, and he can offer a free breakfast. I mentioned to John, that this was an unusual offer since breakfast closes at 1030 am. Yea, wow. He said it would take 3-4 hours for a manager to call me. That’s the level of service to expect.Please see the photo attached. While this hotel seems to be recently renovated, you can expect stains on the bathroom vanity.If only this hotel seem to care about their guests especially elite members, you could hope your problems could be addressed. As the repeated service lapses , unwillingness of managers to respond and frankly unhygienic housekeeping issues, I would find other places to stay.","New York City, New York","loveroftravel30</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",107,2.0

I called front desk and the person answering the phone said she would get with night manager on duty and call me right back. No call or follow up.

Public transportation is readily accessible, since Times Square/42nd Street has the most subway lines running through it in the entire city.The IHG Crowne Plaza brand offers fairly similar accommodations across the brand. But, being in New York City, this means that something like a refrigerator costs extra. In this case, $30/visit. I wasn't happy about that, especially since my wife is a Platinum Elite Member. Also, where other Crowne Plazas have Keurig coffee makers with good coffees, this one had one of those basic coffee makers with basic coffees.I am guessing that all of this is to channel you downstairs to their coffee bar, which is very good. We were given coupons to use at the coffee bar, which did help, and was appreciated. But, you do have to watch the hours, which are pretty short on the weekend.The room is good, and is similar to what you get at other Crowne Plazas. We requested and got a room further away from the elevator, which was a good idea, and kept things quiet. We paid and got the view onto Times Square.

We typically stay at the Marquis but it was very pricey for the date that I had in mind. I called ahead to make sure we get a roll away and that you could have one in a room with double beds.I was checked in by an unfriendly front desk employee who informed that I could only get a roll away in a room with a one bed. I explained to her that a person from the hotel told me otherwise. She was not apologetic and then proceeded to charge me for the roll away! We came in late and ordered room service - all of which must’ve been sitting under a lamp. Typically, I would’ve chosen to eat out but we were exhausted. The quality was poor.Lastly, we valet parked our car for which they charge a premium - I expected the charge and have no complaint for the charge they quoted me. That was fine. Parking is for 24 hours. (However, in my past experience hotels will let you stay a little over the exact 24 hour period- The Marquis for example. They charge less and they allow for some wiggle room about departure.)When we were finished with our sight seeing, I called the number on the card for our car. They instructed me to call when I was ready for the car. The number was out of service. I called repeatedly from my own phone and from my son’s. Eventually, I went down to valet where they charged me another $30 for being late . Thirty minutes - all of which was spent trying to contact them. I explained this to the cashier and he said too bad. Pay for your car or we won’t get it. I’m sure the hotel will say the valet is separate from them. However, when you partner with another business you have the responsibility of ensuring that they provide good service on your behalf.

The furniture in the room was nicked and dented, it smelled like old wood, so I didn’t put my clothes in the drawers. The hangers were even ratty and the iron had limescale all over it. The sheets were damp. The thermostat was odd too-no matter what I set it at, it was stuck at 69 degrees F. The coffeemaker was in the cabinet and at that point would never use it. There was no minibar or any snacks.Even the luggage rack was taped with a gauze bandage.There’s a Starbucks across the street and Duane Reeds and Walgreens everywhere, so you can get what you need.

I’ll pay for 4 full nights. When I arrived I was given a room that had mold growing on the ceiling above the bed. I requested another room. I was given a temporary room and told that my room with two double beds would be reassigned to me the next day. I went down at 10am and made sure that it’s was known what my room situation was and that I would be back in the afternoon to be given keys to my new room. Came back at 4:30pm and was told that no room was approved for me because I booked through booking.com. I had to have a long conversation with the Assistant Manager who told me I booked an ADA room and I couldn’t just ask for a two double bed room because I messed up. I told her I didn’t that I was given an ADA room because of mold on the ceiling in the room assigned to me when I arrived. I had to show my booking reservations to show I was not lying about my reservation. I finally got a room and was told they would waive the $35 daily service fee that covers Wifi, etc. Well good thing we could never even get on the WiFi because it was so bad. The new room I was assigned to had mold all over the bathroom. See pictures below. After so much trouble and poor service previously in sucked it up and didn’t complain. When you stay at a hotel such as the Crown Plaza it is known for its prestige and cleanliness. I’m paying $1800 for 4 nights for a dirty room with mold. I will never stay at this hotel again. I’ve stayed at LaQuintas that we’re nicer than this and more than half the cost. Don’t pay for a room with a view because the hotel really doesn’t have a direct view of Times Square.

When I did that the room price skyrocketed to $750 for the night!! So I canceled and started looking at other hotels. I remembered I had always wanted to stay at the Crowne Plaza in Times Square so I checked there first and became and IHG member, for free, to get the best rates and some extra perks. Their price for the night $245 senior discount rate! So I booked it right away without looking at the TA reviews because you could cancel the room up to 24 hours in advance so I figured if the reviews were bad I would just cancel. The reviews were pretty decent except for a couple of them talking about the front of the hotel having construction. So I called ahead to make sure it wasn’t going to interfere with our stay. I spoke to Sandra who assured me it wouldn’t and she would put us on the higher floor to alleviate any concerns I had about noise. I also told her we were celebrating a BD. When we got to the hotel we had to enter through the side of the building, which is not a big deal at all. Our check in was quick and easy. Special thanks to Victoria who knew her job, was professional, kind and enthusiastic that we were there! Our room was not ready because we had arrived early but they texted us when it was ready and that was great! I texted back if they could make sure the AC in the room was on blast because it was a hot day and we were walking around a lot and they replied: “ Yes of course! Is there anything else we can do to make your stay comfortable?” Yippee!  We got so many freebies! We each received one hotel voucher for buffet breakfast worth $35 each, a $20 voucher that we could spend anywhere in the hotel including bar and restaurant, and four drink vouchers valued at $15!!! We were so happy!!!!! When we got to the room we were pleasantly surprised that they had upgraded us to a corner suite!! The room was icy cold as just like we requested! The room was very nice, bathroom a little small, but big enough to move around and feel comfortable. The bathroom does not have a separate door from the shower area, it’s all together. We had forgotten our toothbrushes and they came to the room immediately with complementary brushes and tooth paste. All hotel staff was pleasant and able to answer any questions we had. The hospitality and the feel of being in a smaller hotel for being such a big hotel was incredible!

He was polite, welcoming, listened & heard. James made us feel that nothing was too much trouble. Perfect check in, excellent customer service! We didn’t eat at the hotel but the bar staff were really efficient and pleasant too. We regularly had drinks and occasionally had dessert there. LIFTS were in full working order and fast. ROOM: I’d booked & paid extra for a Times Square view room & got a corner double double (Room 3601) with a fabulous view of Times Square, including the Empire State Building. Really pleased. • Beds (& pillows, 4 per bed supplied) were very comfortable but are a small double. • Hairdryer provided in a bag on the bathroom shelf, it’s a proper fairly powerful one not one of those wall hose things! • Bathroom, well lit & clean. Fixed shower head over a bath tub. Clean heavy shower curtain. • No issues with the air con, worked perfectly throughout. • Lots of power points provided. All the lamp stand bases on the desk, the TV dresser & the bedside drawers (which also included a couple of USB ports too) had the facility to plug in. • Two luggage stands included. • Small closet space with around 10 wooden hangers provided (we used one of the clip ones to hold the curtains together were they met in the corner to prevent that light gap!) • Usual laundry Bag provided (we didn’t use the service) • Corner arm chair, small coffee table & a desk plus chair provided. • No kettle but a drip machine that you could use the provided tea or coffee bags in (or your own teabags if you’re British!) Cups are disposable, wrapped in plastic. White sugar sachet, sweetener, packet creamer (no milk), plastic stirrer & a paper serviette come packaged up (in more plastic...!) feels wasteful, should be provided separately. - No water bottles provided. - No fridge included but available on request. - No Iron, available on request I think (I pack in a way where I don’t need to iron when I arrive!) CLEANLINESS: excellent, well maintained room, not tired or dated. • The usual toiletries, tea/coffee & towels replaced without fail, housekeeping were great and done by lunchtime or earlier (we were always out during the day to be fair). LOCATION: fantastic on the doorstep of Times Square TKTS red steps (which is the section our room view was of) with the Subway on 50th just a couple of minutes walk away. Scaffolding is still up so entrance is to the side, under the tunnel. SUMMARY: Some of the reviews had worried me but I honestly couldn’t fault it. It’s not the highest end luxury & my expectations for city hotels, given the numbers that go through them are low but this was certainly not a shoddy hotel in my experience & did live up to the Crowne Plaza brand. We had a jam packed itinerary for the week, you really just need a place to lay your head in NYC but even the kids started calling the room ‘home’... lovely to return back to each evening with our tourist sore feet and buzzing heads.

However once at the hotel an additional charge of $35 per day was charged to my credit card prior to check out.

I claimed to the customer service of the hotel as I never asked for this, had no drinks at the bar, and internet was included in my paid room rate. The guy in charge of customer services (Chris) confirmed this fee was not applicable when I claimed. However at check out they kept the service fee charge of $35 per day. Had a long discussion with the reception manager (who was very kind) but the charge remained and their excuse was “this is charged by all hotels in New York”, which it’s completely false. They charge this “service fee” to everybody in addition to whatever you have paid or rate you have reserved (and this is not a city or county tax, simply a overcharge of Crowne Plaza).

Several hours later a room was offered, but had 1 king sized bed when it was supposed to be a twin room, so we were left waiting again for the final room, which obviously wasn't ideal. The rooms were fine when we were in, our view was of the river which was lovely. The rooms were quiet and clean, with plenty of room and a large bathroom (with a great shower). The lighting was good which is always a bonus, with plenty of mirrors. The location was the reason that we booked this hotel, as it's literally in the middle of everything. There are plenty of bars and restaurants a stones throw away with plenty of choice. The hotel is in Times Square so you are surrounded by the hustle and bustle of New York which is great. Taxi's were easily available, and the hotel will request one if not. The staff were very helpful with recommendations on what to see, when to go and we managed to get discount tickets within the hotel which was good.

Bathrooms are large and clean. I had a little concern about the floor structure that you can feel worked somewhat and is not flat anymore and this is a concern especially when you are staying in a high rise.The price is reaching the expensive range but not the luxury range and it is a good value price compared to some other hotel in the area with better prices but a very bad experience I had 2 years ago.","Willis, Texas","369geico</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Willis, Texas</strong>",268,4.0

I called the hotel two days prior to arrival to arrange an amenity to be left in the room for his birthday. I was sent a credit card authorization form and a guest amenity form. I filled those out and faxed them to the number I was given. I called to make sure it was received which the fax never was so I emailed them to the person I spoke to on the phone and she forwarded to the food and beverage manager. The next day we’re driving to the airport and my husband receives a phone call from the hotel asking to speak with me. He already knows something is up now because I had to try and explain what I wanted the surprise to be over the phone. They told me they never got the form and I was transferred to someone in food and beverage. They also told me the my never got the fax or email and I told them the number on the amenity form I wanted which was a six pack of beer and chips and dip. Well apparently the form they had was different than mine because the choices for that number was different. I kept telling her what I wanted and she kept asking if I wanted a birthday cake. I was getting so frustrated I was ready to cancel everything and that’s when they told me they’d handle it. The next day we’re checking in and we go to dinner and realize our door doesn’t lock behind us. We go downstairs tell the front desk they apologize and call security to fix it right then. We leave for dinner and come back 2 hours later to find it had not been fixed. We’re infuriated now because our things had been unlocked for 2 hours. We get a hold of the manager who apologized and said she can transfer us to another room. So I pack everything up and during this time security comes and fixes the door in less than a minute. Why wasn’t this done two hours prior? By that time the manager shows up and asks if we want to stay in the room since it’s fixed now. Um NO I’ve already packed everything up. So we take the elevator to the different room only to find that room ALREADY HAD PEOPLE IN IT. By this time I’m just thinking all of it is a joke so manager comes back up there and sends us to another room with a “better view” we now go to the third room which doesn’t have a better view but whatever we were tired of moving. While we were in our first room we went to get ice and the machine didn’t work. I called the front desk and asked if they could bring some up and I was told to go down to another floor to get ice. Really?! I shouldn’t have to do that. This hotel has poor customer service and is not the luxury you expect when staying in Times Square.

No.Woke up early next morning and no warm water in the shower, so it was a cold start for us all.

But with that said you charge a certain amount your clientele expect their monies worth. Nowhere was I told this building was under construction made it hard for an out of towner to find the building. Once inside things where much better. Cleaner and more up to date, other than all of the lobby area windows covered in construction tarp. Check in took a bit as they were busy and there wasn't a large waiting line area so we all felt cramped. The check in process itself went fairly quickly but it the rep had to call someone to switch a room fro us(?) they did was give us two drink coupons for the small bar they have in the check in area. The room itself was clean and has an amazing view for times square.(which we had purchased). But the toilet paper holder was falling out of the wall. The shower on/off handle would spin and didn't seem to be bolted in?!?! We had reserved the room for 3 days and we were a family of four, they always seem to give only enough towels for three. So we called down and had some more delivered and they did promptly deliver them. But each day they cleaned our room they gave us less and less of everything. Started with 4 coffee pods and the final day we were there they left only one. Started with three sets of towels final days was left 2 sets. Just seemed very odd. Again the location was great being only steps away Times Square and a multitude of attractions and shops. But not worth the price we paid. Not only was the hotel expensive but we ended up paying more than $240 just to have our car valet parked through the hotel for three days.

Still, we thought we would try this one figuring maybe the last stay was a one-off anomaly. Well, the place was fairly run down. I don't think there were any problems that could have been rectified by the staff, certain things were too far gone. Maybe the mold on the shower ceiling, but nothing else. When we checked out, we learned of all the taxes. Many of them. Not the hotel's fault; that's New York for you. Nickle and diming the tourist. You have to park in the parking garage which is a part of the hotel. I'll say it again because this is important. The parking garage is part of the hotel. We checked in on Sunday and out on Tuesday. $140 for that time. We hadn't gotten the car at any point so it just sat there. This is not advertised anywhere and it would appear the cost is part of your hotel stay. It is not. In checking out, we paid almost $200 more than we expected to after already dealing with high prices for everything over 2 days. The deal clerk said it's a different company completely and they have no control over it. EVEN THOUGH IT IS A PART OF THE HOTEL! I get it. It's New York and they can get away with it because there's no shortage of tourists.

However, this time we had the good fortune to speak with Sandra at the IHG Platinum Elite desk.When I asked about the refrigerator, her immediate response was “Let’s get you in a room first, so your husband can get some rest”. Within less than one minute, she had handed us a set of room keys and called to have a refrigerator delivered to the room at no charge. Sandra then thanked us for being Platinum members and sent us off to our room. Within five minutes of entering the room, Sandra personally called to ensure that everything was to our liking. As soon as I hung up the phone, there was a knock on the door, which turned out to be the refrigerator with two complimentary bottles of water.Sandra is professional, thoughtful, and empowered. Rather than telling us what she couldn’t do for us (as her coworkers had), she utilized her resources to show us what she could do.

If you are looking for the best location on Times Square while being close to the theatres, Rockefeller Center, Central Park and 5th avenue and a good value, this is your choice! You are close to the subway stations can walk to many of the local sites. There's no need to stay at any of the more expensive hotels on Times Square as the crowds are far worse the closer you get to 45th-42nd. This one still has all the views with a little breathing room while you walk! Those on the side streets, while convenient, don't have a view at all since they are shorter building facing side streets. While the hotel does have a little wear, it's really trivial. Unless you are used to and expect extremely high end experiences only, you will find this one clean, well kept and perfect for your stay. They are doing a bit of construction on the front entry which means you enter on the sides, but that seriously doesn't matter. We had a bit of a snafu with our Booking.com reservation, but Crown Plaza took care of everything. Big shout out to Val who contacted me while I was en route and reassured me all was still booked and we'd be taken care of and to Donald at the front desk who was super friendly, helpful and really a great representative of their hotel! In the end, they honored our rate and gave us some complimentary food vouchers which was a huge help and got us to eat at their hotel each day. Their restaurant, Brassiere 49, has a great view, good food and is the perfect place to sit and take a break during the day or a the end of the day.If I had anything I would suggest they work on it would be 1) The older gentlemen staff at Grind was NOT friendly, bordering rude and made me dread getting my morning coffee. 2) When booking large kids groups, keep them in their own part of the hotel. We had a room next to a kids group where clearly there were no chaperones as the kids were running around wild for hours in the evening and super obnoxious. I had to call the front desk one of the nights and they sent security up...who handled it quickly. But still, young teens should not be left to roam these hotels so freely and obnoxiously. This could have happened anywhere, I just think the hotel should book them away from their other guests.",,Familytraveler916,4,5.0

Swimming pool - On a hot day we decided to come back to the hotel and use the swimming pool we had paid for. You must have your own padlock for the lockers.

Before we even travelled I had a bad expereince; as my wife is diabetic and needs a small fridge in a hotel room to store insulin, I e-mailed the hotel to ask if rooms already contained a fridge; they couldn't even be bothered to reply. On arrival at the hotel we had to wait an age for our room to be ready, when it finally was I phoned down requesting a small fridge; they promised to bring one """"in a few minutes""; it actually took nearly 3 hours! Then I discovered that the safe in the room didn't work; I followed the instructions faithfully but nothing doing; on phoning down for ""service"" I was told in a very condescending way that I must have swiped my card the wrong way round; when after yet another long wait - an hour and a half - someone came to our room to look at it, he spotted straight away that it was broken and sent me down to the reception to ask for a safe deposit box at that level - hugely inconvenient. On the second day they removed all the large towels from the bathroom, even though we had not placed them on the floor and were perfectly happy to re-use them; this took well over 2 hours to sort out. The restaurant - an absolute embarrassment given the charges. The evening menu is seriously limited, they showed no understanding or concern when I pointed out that my wife as a diabetic had to be extremely careful with food; some of the waiters were absolutely incompetent. Ask for a milky coffee and they fill the cup with coffee to the brim, leaving no space for milk; when I asked them to bring me a piece of cake together with my coffee so that I could enjoy them together, that proved to be too difficult. I despair. I am used to 4-star Swiss hotels, so I expect high standards, but given how expensive the Crowne Plaza is this should not be a problem.

I am quite impressed by their service. I want to give them 5 star but I cannot due to that they charged double that comes $18k for 9 nights with two rooms. I found this strange charging issue while I stayed in Crowne Plaza Times Square, so I visited the counter to discuss about it and the gentleman spend several minutes to resolve the issue. He told me the charging issue has been resolved but actually it has not been resolved. Now, I get $18k charge on my credit card. WHY?I returned to my country and I found $18k is still there. So, what I am not happy is about the credit card payment issue that has killed my credit card usage due to double charge, $18k, and it has cause limit issue. Now I am unable to use credit card anymore due to limit issue even though I should have enough room to use credit card if Crowne Plaza Times Square did not charge twice. I received full payment on my card on both 2nd and 3rd July, and my check out was on 4th July. This must be caused by time difference between NZ and NYC. I need to pay some other important payments but unable to use my credit card anymore that made me very upset. I called Crowne Plaza as soon as I returned NZ but I was told I need to contact Billing department of Crowne Plaza Times Square; however, it was Friday night in NYC at the time due to time difference between New Zealand and NYC.

The ladies at the front were very accommodating and friendly. (Wanda & Rita)After check in we were getting cleaned up to go to a show and ran out of hot water before everyone could shower. Considering the size of the hotel and the location and of course the amount of guests that this hotel would have I never thought that they would run out of hot water. Sadly I dismissed talking to anyone that night and since we were in a hurry I left it alone until the next evening when it was time to have a shower. This time there was absolutely no hot water and we were running out to another previously planned engagement. I called the front desk and told them how disappointed I was and that I would like the situation dealt with ASAP for the amount of money I paid for this hotel I expected some service. When we returned to our hotel room later that night, the message to maintenance was lost and nobody showed up to fix the problem, I immediately went down to the front desk and the lovely ladies there called the appropriate maintenance staff and sent him to the room. I went to talk to the front office manager John Acosta and he dismissed my complaint because he was busy doing other things. After the maintenance staff fixed the problem and was rude to my children I took the two drink certificates we received at check-in and decided to take my two daughters to the lounge for a non-alcoholic Shirley temple. When Micheal in the lounge was rude to us once again I decided to warn others about my experience. It surprised me how super friendly some of the staff were and how super disrespectful and rude the other half were.

Checking in was fast and efficient and the staff were very welcoming. My room was on one of the highest floors in the building with limited views of the Hudson River and some of the city. Perfectly acceptable for my needs as after a long flight I just wanted to sleep! I would suggest requesting a room that isn’t next to the lifts though as the noise which is almost constant 24hr a day was somewhat annoying but not enough for me to complain and I slept to I guess not that bad! The room itself was very nice, large very comfortable bed, nice furniture and gear en suite bathroom, I have added an image below. The room was very clean and had plenty of space for what I believe was just a standard double room.

In other words, the windows wrap from the north side continuing to the east side of the room. This was pretty nice for staring out into the city from up high.

It didn't bother us much at all, what was annoying was the bright blue Barclays building sign at night. Luckily the room has curtains to block out most of the outside lights. Other than that, for the most part everything was in order. The bathroom is a bit on the smaller side than I'm used to and the closet basically shares that space as well. Plenty of room for 2 people. For the price you pay a simple continental breakfast would've been nice. We did not get to try their restaurant/bar. (Why bother when you're in Times Square?) Elevators were pretty quick most of the time. Not much waiting or stops except for the mornings. Subways are 1-2 blocks away depending on the station. One small gripe, if any staff from the hotel reads this, might I suggest reversing the toilet paper holder. It's mounted in such a way that when you pull the toilet paper out the whole roll starts to come off the holder. If the holder were installed in reverse, that would solve the problem.","San Diego, California","bigsusus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",4,4.0

There are a few things that very much annoyed me enough to write about it. So here is my story. I reserved my room on the 27th of this month and due to issues with my flight I got to this hotel around 2 or 3am the next morning. When I made it to the front desk to checkin I realized I forgot my wallet in the shuttle that dropped me off and ontop of that my phone was dead. The front desk agent was very nice and told me where I could charge my phone to call the shuttle service to get my wallet back. She saw that I was an IHG member and knew I had a reservation but I still needed my credit card and my ID. While waiting for the shuttle service to come back i wanted to let her know that i would have my wallet in 30 to 40 minutes and to thank her for her help. Unfortunately she was not there but her supervisor was. I decided to let him know about my situation since the woman u was speaking with earlier was gone. I was also going to see if a picture of my ID and credit card would be enough to get me in my room until the shuttle driver arrived with. Y wallet. While e playing my situtation to the Supervisor he got a very nasty attitude with me and very rudely cut me off while I was talking and told me to wait down stairs next to the bellman. Then he just ignored me and went about his business. I wanted to get his name but he had his name tag covered by a jacket. At that point I decided not to make a big deal out of his attitude and continued to wait for the shuttle driver. I had gotten. My wallet about 30 minutes later and went to checkin. The same Supervisor's attitude was very short and impolite. I felt like he thought I was below him or I did not deserve to stay at this resort. After he gave me my room key I proceeded to my assigned room and the keys did not work. I had to go back to the front desk which was over 30 floors down and get new keys. The same Supervisor was there and seemed shocked that the keys didn't work. So for some reason he told security to check the room and he also called the room to see if anyone was in there. That seemed strange to me because any other hotel or resort I have stayed in would just give me a new key. That is how i knew that he already knew something was wrong and was trying to hide it. After he called the room he said someone picked up and had to assign me a new room. He did not even apologize to me for the mistake. After I got the key to the new room I proceeded to it and when I got in there was cloths and bags all over the place (picture is attached to this post). I went back to the front desk which now was over 20 floors down. The same Supervisor was there again and i told him and showed him the picture I took and now he was shocked. He called out the person assigning the rooms to take care if it and offered me a free breakfast voucher. The person assigning the rooms came out and was very nice. He apologized to me and told me that the day was a little hectic and that he would take care of thg e problem. The Front Desk Supervisor seemed to catch an atti5with him as well eventhough he was doing his best to fix the problem. While the room assignment person was off making sure a room he found was clean and empty, the Front Desk Supervisor handed me 3 more breakfast vouchers and finally apologized to me. The room assignment person came back and told me every5was good now but the room type I had reserved was not available. I overlooked that and told him it was ok since I saw how hard he looked for a room for me. He then offered me dinner for the inconvenience and I accepted. AS I WAS WALKING AWAY THE FRONT DESK SUPERVISOR TOLD THE ROOM ASSIGNMENT PERON HE JUST GAVE ME BREAKFAST VOUCHERS AND WHY DID HE GIVE ME A COMPED DINNER? Very nasty and rudely to the room assignment person. I could also tell he had made a few more comments but could not hear everything because I was walking away. Bottomline, the Front Desk Supervisor working overnight from June 27th to the 28th had a very nasty attitude and made me feel uncomfortable about staying there. The room assignment person was awesome and had a fantastic attitude when under pressure and dealing with the negative attitude of the Front Desk Supervisor. The rest if the hotel staff was great.","Orlando, Florida","892dennisg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",47,3.0

The best thing about this hotel is the location - it's right at the heart of Times Square where all the action is.The room was clean, modern, and actually spacious by New York standards. There were plenty of sockets and USB ports for us to plug in our devices, and WiFi was pretty good. Our rooms were cleaned daily and toiletries were regularly restocked. However, the room did not have a minibar or even a refrigerator, which is odd for a hotel at this price range. The hotel's facade along Broadway was being renovated, so there was a bit of a confusion locating the hotel entrance when we first arrived. Although there was a sign directing people where to go, it was too small to easily notice. Also, given the hotel's location and popularity among large groups (like student tour groups and large families), the elevators can get a bit busy at times.Overall, this is a very good hotel and highly recommended!","Manila, Philippines","FDT92</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",15,4.0

There wasn't anything wrong with the room however I wasn't wowed either. I think this is because it's older decor; warmer browns/creams in colour rather than the fashionable silver/greys. I would say that the hotel could benefit from some TLC throughout as rooms and public areas are beginning to show signs of wear and tear.The location is what sells this hotel - literally step outside the hotel and you're in the centre of Times Square, overlooking the M & M's store. The front entrance is currently undergoing refurbishment so all access is via the rear doors where the cars/taxis drop off customers.When we checked out the bill showed the resort fee as $5 more than we were expecting.

We were looking at this hotel prior to our trip, however we made the mistake of trying to save some money by staying at a nearby hotel (The Gallivant) only to regret it INSTANTLY! After one awful night and almost on the verge of tears, I jumped on booking.com to see if Crowne Plaza had any rooms available and thank goodness it did! We were greeted by a lady at the front desk named Rhoda who made everything better instantly. She was so kind, helpful and accommodating. While I’m still on the verge of tears, Rhoda put us in a nice & spacious room and gave us vouchers for a complimentary breakfast and drink! Rhoda has remembered our faces every day since arriving at Crowne Plaza (note: we still here, currently on day 5 and never want to leave). Crowne Plaza is perfectly located in Times Square, yet is still quiet and classy enough to escape the hustle and bustle of the surroundings to get a good nights sleep. All the staff here are so friendly and willing to help. It’s been a fantastic experience from the moment we stepped through the doors.If you can, spend the extra money to stay here. It’s worth every penny. Our time in NYC was almost ruined after our first night at the other hotel. We are so glad to be spending our time in NYC at Crowne Plaza.

My average flight number per year is ~140-200 flights per year across the continental U.S., Europe, Asia, and sometimes South America. Needless to say, I am seasoned when it comes to living on the road.This past weekend I was traveling not for work, but for pleasure. Once a year, I visit a large city with some old colleagues of mine to relax and enjoy local activities. NYC for us is a mainstay because of the great food, and most of all, Broadway.As such, the Times Square Crowne Plaza is usually my top choice given the location and amenities the facility offers. Though some Crowne Plaza locations have a reputation for being a little aged, this location is definitely well kept and a great option for a weekend trip in the city.This weekend was special for us as I decided to bring my parents along, as my father had never been to New York, or seen a Broadway show.We arrived Friday morning at LGA and took a NYC Yellow Taxi to the Crowne Plaza. The Taxi Driver was named, ""Freddie"" and he and I had some great discussion while he was driving us to the hotel. He was discussing how long he had been in NYC, and that he came over from Ecuador with his wife and mother. The conversation was very pleasant, and Freddie was a very nice guy. This will be important later.For the first time in my career (5+ years of 100% travel), I left my laptop in the NYC Yellow Taxi. It's my fault. I was sidetracked ensuring that my family had their bags while assisting with the payment method. Needless to say, I left the laptop in the front seat. This is a work laptop, and I needed it to complete some tasks before stopping for the weekend. Once I realized (in line at check-in) that my laptop was missing, I ran back outside to find that the driver had already left.I have several remote lectures to give next week, and I cannot host the meeting without this laptop, as the data is encrypted. I'm completely stuck, now.This, is a complete nightmare. I called NY Taxi, but was advised that they do not accept calls on lost property. I was directed to their website. I submitted a claim on their website, and the contact my work IT team to discuss options.After discussion, it was decided to plan as though the laptop is gone forever. As such, I was required to submit a police report before the company can consider the loss covered and allow me new laptop hardware.After much fumbling on the web with my cell phone, I approached the front desk of Crowne Plaza and spoke to Michelle. Michelle was kind and provided me with the address and telephone number to NYPD 18th Precinct 3C. I called NYPD who advised that I must make the report in person only. Fine.I walked to the NYPD precinct office and made my report in person. With this, I had the case number to provide to work IT, and to get my new laptop hardware. Hopefully, this would only disrupt one day of my lectures next week. Outlook = grim.By this time, it was early afternoon and I was ready to be finished with the day. I had done everything in my power to correct the situation, and mistakes do happen, I was pretty bummed; what a stupid mistake!The rest of the evening was uneventful, with dinner and our first Broadway show of the weekend (Come from away). We spent the rest of the evening walking around and trying whiskey bars. Saturday morning: I receive a call at 7:46AM. This was an officer from NYPD precinct 18. Freddie, the taxi driver, was there with my missing laptop and wanted to give it to me personally. WOW.I dress and uber straight to the Police office. I'm met with some laughter and the NYPD officers saying, ""wow, you are SO lucky!"". I look and behind me is standing Freddie with my laptop, and the guy is all smiles! Freddie then tells me, when his shift ended he cleaned his car and found the laptop. It was in the front against his middle console. He knew that the computer was mine, and he himself was distraught.He remembered our conversation during the ride.Freddie, on his own time, went back to Crowne plaza at 6:00 AM, and spoke to the front staff. This was when Michelle (whom helped me yesterday) remembered speaking to me. Michelle advised that she remembered me, but that she was remiss in taking my information down (and I was remiss in giving it to her). Both Freddie and Michelle know I'm there, but they have no way to know my name or how to reach me.Michelle DID remember, however, that I went to the 18th precinct office of NYPD. Michelle advised Freddie to go to NYPD, which he did.Afterwards, Freddie drove me back to the hotel and was SO GLAD to have found me.Needless to say, I was very touched and showed my gratitude to Freddie and team.Were it not for the kindness of Freddie, my work would have been disrupted. I work in the medical field, which means this disruption could have caused delays in patient care (indirectly). Were it not for Michelle's kind attention and keen memory, Freddie would have been unable to take the laptop somewhere I could be reached. The staff at NYPD also were extremely helpful as well.If these stars had not all lined up, my week at work would have been pretty rough.The stars, though, aren't really stars that line up, they are people.Freddie, Michelle, and the folks at NYPD are the stars here. Your hard work and kind attention, and overall good nature lead to this excellent outcome for me, and salvaged the rest of my visit to NYC. By taking the extra time, you eased my mind for the rest of my trip with my family, AND you ensured that my work was not disrupted this week.I wanted to share this excellent story, and thank Freddie and Michelle for their kindness. I will absolutely recommend this location to my friends and colleagues, when I tell this story.Thank you SO much!",,jharper34,1,5.0

The hotel sent up an engineer and a housekeeper who got the drain unplugged and put plastic and towels over the carpet, so that got handled. When I was at the hotel the next week the air conditioner in my room did not function, the room safe was broken and the room had no coffee or water. When I asked for help the only thing I got was water. The safe was not fixed and the air conditioner for some reason that was not resolvable could not be fixed. When I arrived back in my room the message light on my phone was blinking and when I touched the message button it only rang a busy signal. When I asked to have the phone reprogrammed I was informed that that could not be done. Then, to top off the whole experience, for some reason the hotel decided not to service my room the next day.

After reporting this to the front desk they mentioned that they could not show me the cameras and after talking to a nice colombian manager they said that they had not found any trace that could lead to the underwear arriving in my room. So basically I was now a liar and I had made all this up. Incredible lack of empathy, poor customer service and resolution of guest problems in this hotel.

This time I brought my family for school vacation week. Like many other visits I chose to add breakfast to my stay as they have a great buffet better then most hotels! One of things I like as a regular guest is that they are always friendly and seem to remember me from my last visits. This time Ali our server came over to say hello and greeted me with a smile and asked if I was here this time on vacation and was very happy to meet my family. When my wife mentioned it was my Birthday he wished me a happy birthday. Later that night we had a knock on the door and room service showed up with a huge piece of Chocolate cake and a bottle of red wine with a card from Ali wishing me a happy Birthday! I was shocked at the gesture as it was totally unexpected and very thoughtful. He has waited on me many times and always friendly as I’m usually eating alone before starting my day if client appointments.So I was truly taken back by his thoughtfulness. We stayed several more days and never got to thank him, but he added something special to my birthday and my wife, kids and I all enjoyed the cake together! The wine was just for the two of us and made for an even more special night.Overall this hotel is comfortable, great showers, comfortable beds, good food options and as an IHG member they often give you extra vouchers for the cafe.Overall we had an amazing visit to NYC made extra comfortable by Ali, and the front desk staff, and other waiter Tofael who also provided friendly service.This is the way all hotels should treat their guests and why I always return!Kudos to management for creating such a positive environment for the staff to rest guests so well!","Hanover, Massachusetts","davemE6672VS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hanover, Massachusetts</strong>",7,5.0

We were on the 44th floor at the rear of the hotel and were generally pleased with the room itself - good size, clean, amazing beds (temporally eased my lower back pain!), other reviews have mentioned it was either too hot or cold, we found the temp to be just fine, so much so it didn’t even cross our mind. Windows offered a relatively good view out to the river, no doubt it would have been better with the Times Square view but that’s an extra cost. Could have done with a fridge in the room and the shower would have benefitted from more water pressure.The one sticking point is the service fees. Although we were aware of them at the time of booking I still find it hard to justify the hotel actually charging them to guests. Several booking sites state that the WiFi is free (as you may expect) but apparently this is part of the service fee and at $35 a day seems excessive. Yes it includes other ‘benefits’ but I would expect and have received these at other hotels at no extra cost. I would have happily paid $10-15 for the WiFi each day but the rest is surplus to demand and I expect many guests don’t make use of these extras. Either include it in the price of the room or break it down into optional extras that you pick and choose to pay as you use them. The member of staff who checked us in ‘conveniently’ forgot to mention the service fees and gave the impression that the WiFi was indeed free.I would happily stay again if the service fees were reconsidered and more transparent to guests.",,adamg114,5,4.0

Ordinarily, I would avoid staying in Times Square, but, we thought it seemed like the right place to stay for a first time visit with the whole family. In many ways we were right - there’s so much to do and see, even late at night and all the lights and hustle & bustle are fascinating to children who normally live in a small, quiet town. The Crowne Plaza is located just off Times Square - we could see Times Square from our room on 34th floor but it wasn’t too close so the city noise didn’t keep us awake. The room was fairly quiet (a bit of corridor noise and you could hear the shower etc in the room next door) and very standard for a New York City hotel room. Two double beds, a bathroom and the usual facilities of a kettle, air con, tv etc. We just felt that the room was really quite tired. The decor seemed quite old fashioned, the beds were soft and quite small, the drawers and storage in the room were limited and needing a little bit of TLC. There was nothing majorly wrong but there certainly wasn’t anything interesting, exciting or out of the ordinary either. To be fair, it was a great base for us - we were out exploring and doing all the usual touristy things all day that we only used the room to sleep in - didn’t spend any time in it just chilling out etc. The staff were nice and friendly and the maid cleaning the room each day did a great job.

Upon our return to the hotel approximately 1 hour later, we were confronted rather aggresively In front of a few people in reception by the guy who took our drinks orders saying ""you did not pay your bill"" we told him we had put it on our room and a lady had took the signed bill he then said again aggresively ""which lady"" so we pointed out the lady he then walked off leaving us a little embarrassed and spoke to the lady and then just Continued with his normal job. At this stage we would have expected him to come apologise explain it was a mix up but there was nothing. This left us upset and actually a little fearful to return to the bar. On the same evening we also requested a hair dryer to be bought to the room which never came, when we called to chase it up we were told that they were busy and it would come but it never materialised.

It’s right in the heart of the Times Square district, so if that’s what you want, that’s what you got. A short (but crowded) walk to all major subway lines. During the course of our stay we walked all the way up to Lincoln Center, and all the way down to Greenwich Village. It’s clean, although the housekeeping is rather slow (room not serviced by 3:00? Really?) For where it is, and the volume of street noise in the vicinity, the room was fairly quiet. That being said, we were on the 46th floor, facing west (away from Times Square) and I sleep with noise-canceling headphones. But my wife slept peacefully also. The exercise facility is actually a NY Sports Club, which has positive and negative aspects. The variety of equipment is much greater than in any hotel I’ve ever visited, but the place is usually packed with über-serious athlete-types, not tourists looking to get in a workout in between indulgences. Incredibly, in “The city that never sleeps”, the facility was shut down at 6 pm on Sunday night. This was unacceptable and the hotel should do something to rectify this for their guests. There’s no lobby area to speak of. My wife was attending an oncology conference, and she was pleased with the conference facilities. Overall we enjoyed our stay, it served our purposes, but generally we would prefer to stay in a quieter location.

Their rates were fair, the location was perfect and I’d had a good experience in the past there. We arrived at 5pm on Friday afternoon, close to shift change time. This lovely lady named Evelyn offered to check me in and I told her a little about our trip and asked if we could be put on the same floor. We different types of rooms so I didn’t hold any hope for adjoining rooms. She got to work, left the desk for a few minutes and came back with a big smile. I think I can put you in adjoining rooms and I’ll waive the up charge. She stayed an extra 25 minutes past her quitting time to make sure we had everything we needed she even threw in complimentary breakfast vouchers for OUR patience! Wow!

I absolutely loved walking out right onto Times Square. I had a room on the 41st floor with a view of TS, which was quite beautiful.The room was quite spacious. The design however, needs an overhaul 10 years ago. It's so utterly tasteless and old that it's almost charming. Plastic toilet seats, plastic and paper cups, wallpaper coming off the wall, finishing starting to crumble, a stench of chlorine for the first night of my stay...at some point the sideboard came apart. I am currently staying at the CP in Berlin- which is everything this hotel should have been. Sleek, modern, airy, calming and sexy- as opposed to dark, dingy, outdated and dusty. The staff was warm and welcoming, did a great job.I was given extra drink vouchers, as I had a long stay.My coffee maker was mouldy, but I received a new one quickly. I got stuck in the elevator on the Ground Floor for about 20 minutes. The hotel didn't at all seem proactive in making an effort to find out who we were and maybe offer us some compensation.This caused me to miss my show. I complained about this and without hesitation three nights worth of facility fees were removed from my bill- this covered the cost of my ticket. I still feel that this is not enough. Being stuck in a small elevator with 8 other people is NOT a fun experience. Do your job and make us forget this ever happened!!

We booked two rooms for a special occasion trip & our request for Times Square view rooms wasn't honoured as 'the hotel is full due to Spring Break'. So what, we booked a whole year ago?? Check in was coldly professional & we weren't offered help with our bags, just told where the lift was. Ok we are capable but still. Our room was tired, old, dark & in need of a refit. Furniture covered in scuff marks, bathroom very dated with a leaking tap, not enough sockets & none with USB ports in them to list a few. There was no fridge, no slippers & robes & no water. Not the room I envisaged spending my Silver Wedding in. Ok in New York you only sleep & shower in it but not the point. Room was clean and we had plentiful towels all week & sheets were changed. Bed was clearly old but it was ok due to massively thick mattress topper. Checkout was again coldly professional - told to 'take your bags downstairs to the luggage guy' when our friends bags were taken away at the desk by a helpful chap and all done for them? Bar staff varied, again very cold, but the guy who served me last night who wasn't a bar server was lovely. This place really needs to up its game as the rooms are awful (unless you are a favoured American guest on Spring break) and it has nothing going for it apart from the location. Will not return (even if it was free) and wouldn't suggest anyone else goes either. Too many other, better hotels in the vicinity. If client services read this and question why I didn't complain whilst there, what was the point when I know I wouldn't have been given a better room as I was told twice that the hotel was full.","Ipswich, England.","Cullies</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ipswich, England.</strong>",57,3.0

The shower wasn't even glass screen but a sliding plastic sheet that did a bad job keeping the water in. The room showed it's age with no fridge, slippers or tooth paste. After our first night, we ask for a room change as the room was right next to the lifts which was preventing us from having a good sleep.The second room we moved into had slightly better layout. The bathroom was alot smaller but at least it had glass screen and doors like a proper shower, no fridge or slippers again. However, the sink had a leakage and was clogging up everytime we used it. So off we go to our third room.The third room was away from the lifts and the bathroom was working but I'm contemplating another change. Why?

On the way back, I booked a room around 11pm before going to a friend's late night birthday party. When I got to the hotel at 3am, waited in line for 20 minutes because there was only one person at front desk and one couple took forever to process. About to pass out when finally got to the front and was told the reservation was canceled by them because credit card was declined (the number had recently been changed by BofA due to them having a security breach). So here I am at around 3am with no where to stay and they didn't even try to help locate another room elsewhere. I had to book myself at the Intercontinental nearby which was 50-60% more expensive.When I called the front desk and asked to speak to a supervisor to complain about this I was told in a monotone, rude robotic voice that they can't do anything, not even a refund of my first night or even any bonus points. I've been better treated for a coffee maker being broken. I don't write reviews often, but this was the WORST customer service at an IHG or SPG property I've experienced.

And while I don't know everyone's name, I always recognize those who consistently contribute to the quality of my stays.Sylvia Geronimo in the Executive Office always takes my reservation, offers me the best possible rate and insures that any reasonable request is satisfied. And any Front Desk services I might require are always promptly organized and delivered by Juliet Chang and Yoaquina Rollins. And anything to do with my breakfast, lunch or snacks is the domaine of Agathe Texier, the Director of outlets. And as I always have breakfast at the Crowne Plaza Times Square Manhattan in their fabulous ""Brasserie 1605"", all of the servers are simply amazing. And after several years of returning, I even know their names by heart: Ali Rahmat, Tofael Chowdhury, Rahman Mohd, Travis Sherrod, Mahfuz Chowdhury, Tareq Mohammed and Ana Gonzales (hostess). They are now my ""Long-lost cousins"". They keep an eye on my table for two (I dine alone) and appear as if from nowhere anticipating my every request. And they never ask if I would like an orange juice to start, because they know I prefer not. And they efficiently pour my initial cup of black coffee, because they know I do not take cream, milk or sugar.So, as I said in my previous review of my residence at the Crowne Plaza Times Square, I always feel appreciated, but now as well loved as a ""Member of their Family"".

As January is low season I managed to find an amazing package with Aer Lingus flying from CWL to JFK via DUB and as it was their first time I thought Times Square would be a good place to stay, although its certainly not my favorite area of New York. The hotel is brash and impersonal but this is what I expected. There was a bit of a queue at check in but it seemed to go fairly quickly. Check in staff were ok by New York standards. We had a double double which was big enough for the 3 of us and the room itself was fine. The shower was a little temperamental and took a bit of practice getting the water between ice cold and boiling hot but we got the hang of it after a while. Beds were very comfy though. On the negative side we really did not like the outrageous service charge. I would prefer you pay for what you use so if you use the gym/pool then pay for it. In reality we paid $150 for 5 days of Wifi! There is a nice cafe in the lobby area which was not too expensive but the cost of breakfast was a bit too high. Instead we found a fantastic diner called Times Square Diner behind the hotel and went there every day for a proper NYC breakfast saving us $$$.Would I go back? Not really as its not a location I would choose again and its not my style of hotel but the main reason - the service charge just feels like daylight robbery.","Cardiff, United Kingdom","Biztraveller74</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cardiff, United Kingdom</strong>",60,4.0

Especially if it is your first time visiting NYC.On arriving at the Hotel I was met by a lady behind the front desk by the name of Rosa. She was so welcoming and kind to both myself and my son. She was more than happy to answer any of my questions and nothing was too much trouble. This is the sort of person you want to greet you at a hotel after a long flight! Even if she was sick of checking people in or out that day - you would never have known. A bright smile and big welcome. Thank you so much Rosa!Hotel room had a fantastic view of times square. The room was clean, warm, spacious and welcoming. The best night's sleep I've had in a long time. Beds are soooooo comfy!A few issues with the shower trying to regulate the temperature but it was easy once I got the hang of it. Everyday on our return to the room the bed was made, fresh towels supplied along with shampoo etc. Personal belongings were exactly how you left them too. I wasn't aware there was a coffee/tea maker until two days in as it was hidden in the cupboard but we made the most of it once we came across it. Perhaps this would be useful on show for the guest like me who doesn't look in every cupboard unless I'm going to use it. On returning to the hotel in the evening on my sons birthday, there was an ice bucket with some refreshments in, a huge slice of cake and a card for my son wishing him a happy birthday and a great stay. Thank you again Rosa. This was so thoughtful and it really did make my sons day. He was so pleased with it!In the mornings we would head down to the restaurant where we would be greeted by a waitor called Ali. What a fellow! He is just the chap you need in a morning. There he was, every morning, with a welcoming smile and a pot of coffee a hand. Again, nothing was too much trouble. Ali would take an interest in what plans you had for your day and would openly offer help and information if needed. Then the next morning he would remember you and ask you about your day and how it went. It's the little things like this that make all the difference. Just by being polite and helpful. By taking an interest in people and wearing a smile. Thank you Ali for your first class service. You are a credit to Crowne Plaza.The breakfast menu was more than enough and had plenty of options to choose from. Self service makes it even better, as much or as little as you want!Overall the stay was great. Except from the morning of leaving. The conciere gentlemen had mistakenly informed my shuttle bus provider that I was going to JFK wheh I was actually going to Newark. An innocent mistake. When I informed the lady on the front desk that the driver of the shuttle bus had left because he was given the wrong information her initial response was 'so, what do you want me to do about it' The obvious response was help!!!!! She then told me to take a cab to the right airport and failed to acknowledge the conciere/hotels mistake. I found her very stand offish in the first instance. However, she did get the hotel manager after some discussion and he was great. He immediately arranged new transport and luckily we made it to the airport on time.If you want a central hotel. Comfy bed. Great breakfast and a clean room everyday then the Crowne Plaza is the place to go. Whoever was cleaning room 3813 between the 28th of Feb and 5th of March - Thank you for working so hard.

Shower wasn’t great, couldn’t seem to regulate the temperature very well. Cleaners came every day to make bed however bins weren’t always emptied and on a few days dirty towels were taken but not replenished. The bed was amazing... so comfy. The light in our bathroom and our bedside lamps were a little temperamental and sometimes wouldn’t turn on but we didn’t mind.

One morning we were told we could get a coffee in the breakfast seating area without eating but then another member of staff, Fergus was quite rude and told us off for being there despite another member of staff saying it was ok. You have to pay a resort fee at check out which totalled about $32 per day. We only used the WiFi and no other facilities so this was quite steep I feel.

We had searched through hundreds of hotels before booking this one and the location was the decider when booking, this was not wrong. The location of this hotel is fantastic, located in Times Square, you can walk through the Broadway district and you are walking distance to bigger attractions such as Empire State and Rockefeller Building. The hotel room was clean and spacious. We were lucky to have a corner room so got 2 large windows with great views of Times Square. The bed was huge. The hotel has a bar and restaurant, we did not use the restaurant and there is many of places to eat around the hotel and in NYC, however, we used the bar and the service was excellent. The staff take your order quickly and bring your drinks over. The hotel has a service charge which came to $137 at the end of our stay, I didnt agree with this charge, the only benefit we used from this was the wifi, we did not use the gym or telephone in the room, so I thought this was a bit of a con for guests like ourselves.The showers in the room are not great, the temperature would never stay at the temperature you set and you'd often find yourself being scalded by the water after 2 minutes of being in there. Towards the end of our stay, we had a problem with noisy neighbours at ridiculous hours of the morning, which the staff said was a 'school trip', this was very disturbing and annoying but was eventually sorted. My boyfriend and I were lucky to have an end room, however, the other couple with us had a 'inter-connecting' type room, doors obviously locked in the middle but this meant the noise was very loud from inside their rooms and they could hear their next door neighbour snoring through the door! Whilst in New York we did:Helicopter tour - Must do, amazing Staten Island - Free ferry, going past Statue of Liberty9/11 Memorial and Museum Ellen's StarDust Diner Hard Rock Cafe Planet Hollywood Empire State - Top floorRockefeller - Top of the rock (Id say only do one of these buildings, and go with the empire state, the views are exactly the same)Macy's and shopping Be aware that EVERY place you go to expects a tip, even if they haven't done anything for you and you won't get a thank you after giving one as its expected in New York.Overall, an amazing time in New York and loved every minute.

Building older as expected but bathroom was filthy, sink would not drain and it took several tries to flush toilet. Couldn't regulate temperature in room. I had to pay for a second room so we all could be comfortable and that room was so hot. Their suggestion - open the window!! It's March and I like the curtains closed to sleep!!! They put in a portable air conditioner that literally stuck a tube outside and left the window and curtains open... DAY MANAGER GRANT SABAR WAS RUDE, ARROGANT and CONDESCENDING. Don't know if it was that I am a woman or handicapped but he talked to me like I was an idiot and tried to trip up what I was telling him. I just had to shake my head and laugh at him for his feeble attempts. Granted, he was very fortunate there were children in the lobby or I would have not been nice. He actually called my room and asked if I was leaving so he could rent the rooms. If my daughter had not just injured herself I would have been gone but moving her was too painful. The night manager Jason McPherson(sp?) was extremely nice and tried to help all he could. I must say the rest of the staff were very nice and made every effort to make up for the managers attitude. I could have lived with the inconveniences if he had not been a - well let's say not nice person. Saving grace of trip was we had a nice view of Times Square.",,Tfbb22,0,1.0

Only disppointment is the 30.00 service fee! I hope Crowne can find a way to waive this for their elite members. To pay 30.00 extra per night for perks that should be included in a hotel rate is a bit ridiculous. If members reach platinum Elite status perhaps that should be a perk.... no added service fee.Lastly, housekeeping was wonderful on our floor.

The room was very hot and the thermostat didn't work.The carpet was filthy and the walls were stained. Furniture was dusty and sticky. Checked the beds and discovered the sheets and pillows case were dirty and had brown smears. Called the front desk who advised us that they didn't have housekeeping staff on in the evening so nothing they could do. Said they would bring clean linens and we could make the beds ourself. Linens didn't arrive. Called around and made reservations at another hotel. Forced to stay the night but left in the morning. This is at best a two star hotel and that is just for the location.

This hotel is centrally located across from the M&M world in Times Square. Great location and easy to get around to subways, and stores. Check in process was great and efficient (be aware if you book third party they put a hold of $75/night on a credit card. Otherwise it was wonderful. Our room was good. Bed was comfortable, shower clean and towels refreshed. Only problem was the curtain was ripped which caused lighting to come in from the sunlight and tv screens. Informed front desk and they sent an “engineer” who put new hooks and said they had to replace it. None the less for 3 days no fixing was done.If you happen to stumble at concierge the lady working there namd Carina will probably be one of the few most helpful there. If celebrating an event avoid speaking to most people there as my partner spoke to Trish and she said she would send up a bottle of something the day of and that never came. Luckily my partner also mentioned it to Carina and she came to the room with some goodies which had put a smile on my face.Lastly housekeeping. Will tell you now be aware of them. I had good service day 1. Second day a new maid came in upon asking for a change of sheets she huffed and puffed. Not to mention secondly there are no refrigerators as expected so i used an ice bucket to keep things cold. The morning before stepping out i left an item in a bag and in that ice bucket to keep cold. Upon returning i was reasy to end my birthday celebration off with some good expensive desert i had cooling down, and come to find it was thrown out. The bucket was emptied and put back in its original place. The maid claims she touched nothing. Yet there were 2 eyewitness to know that item was left there in the morning. So if they do that who knows what else they may do. Just a heads up that housekeepers name was Kathalina S. I hope they follow up with her on this matter. That could have been my insulin had i been a diabetic or who knows. Lastly, thank you to Wanda from Guest asistance in inroom phone for being able to get me through to resolve the housekeeper issue. She called me back throughout the time to make sure i was getting a resolution and managers were calling me. Thank you again. Overall aside that issue i would think of staying here again, but ensuring to speak or leave notes for housekeepers.","Toronto, Canada","Antonio_daro</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",11,4.0

A few annoying things happened such as the safe didn't work, so I had to go lock my valuables in a lock box at the front desk - needing assistance every time I need to lock up my stuff (like my laptop) is kind of annoying to begin with but worse because I had to wait in the front desk line every single time. Also, we had to have our shower drain fixed two times. They were quick and efficient in getting it fixed but should have been fully fixed first time. Water collecting at feet when we got there. Fixed first time and it was better but still pooling at our feet (gross after a day in NYC grime all over). Had to request a second fix. Pool is definitely NOT for kids. We called the front desk before we made our reservation to make sure kids could swim there - they were like ""of course, all guests can use it"". We get there and they did everything in their power to discourage us from having girls swim. First, they tell our girls they have to have a swim cap or shower cap on at all times. We left and went and bought swim caps. Then they tried to tell us that if they were under 16 we had to swim with them (a lie, rules state you need to accompany them - we were in there watching them), they tried to tell us it was full yet only two people were in there, and they told us the lifeguard wouldn't let them in (no reason given). We ignored them and walked in anyway. The pool is small and 4 lane lines fill the pool. So our girls had to swim in a ""lane"" while lap swimmers acted annoyed we were there. The worst. Do NOT go there for the pool. Lastly, do not go there if the outside temperature is in the 40-60 degree range. They do not have a way to control the temperature well in that range. I am always freezing and I was sweating like a crazy person in our room - it was a sauna. They had maintenance try to fix it but couldn't. So, we had to open our window which was not sufficient. Our room was a balmy 78 degrees and we couldn't do a thing about it. When it was colder outside on our first day (below 30), our room was fine. But for some reason they could not turn the air conditioner on in our room alone?!? They said air conditioner works fine in the summer but they couldn't turn it on in our room and obviously our thermostat just didn't work. It was pretty awful but thankfully really only a huge problem on our last night there. They did compensate us by giving us free breakfast buffet in their restaurant (average hotel breakfast) but I would have preferred a cooler room. I didn't sleep well. Room is also in need of renovation - it wasn't terrible but there is visible dirt on the baseboards, wallpaper peeling in the bathroom, and noticeable wear and tear pretty much everywhere. We appreciated the location as we went to several shows but there are just so many other hotels in that area, we'll stay somewhere else next time. (And also kind of annoying - they're front door onto 7th avenue is shut down?!?) Overall, I'd recommend finding somewhere else to stay on Times Square.",,lolomath16,0,2.0

Check in was smooth and told at the time we had to pay $75 deposit per night of our stay for a service charge which sat pending in my account the whole week. Hotel lobby, reception and elevator room was lovely and clean as well as the hallways to the rooms. Once in the room, it was clean but dark and had to locate all the light switches. Beds were very comfy no fault there. Big armchair looked a bit tired and a metal panel which looked like heating on the wall had fallen off so was wedged closed by the armchair. Had quite a bit of disruption from neighbours going into rooms, lots of door knocking and ding dongs from the lift during the night which was quite restless. Hearing a knock on the neighbours door kept making you think it was your own door. Also not a nice wake up call to hear “SECURITY” shouted through the hallway when they knocked on the neighbours door at 1am. Bathroom was nice and clean however the shower was very powerful and the water was so fierce it hurt to stand underneath for too long. Got free drink vouchers for the hotel bar when checking in which we used at check out waiting for our shuttle home, glad the drink was free because an orange juice cost $5 !!! The newly recruited waiter was quite blunt and rude counting out his tip we gave in front of us at the table... which felt quite intimidating. On check out all we were told was that I had to pay $172 in service charge and resort tax which they’re taking off my card on file and then got a thank you goodbye, which felt quite rude. As well as the doorman and bell boy who looked after our bags were quiet and huffing and puffing at us when we requested to leave our luggage for the day until our evening shuttle to JFK. Overall, the location of the hotel is amazing and is so easy to access wherever in the city you are. Just a bit of extra friendliness needed from the hotel staff and few details needed to update the rooms in the hotel which start to look dated , old fashioned and panels falling apart.

The concierge was also very good and helpful.The detracting of one star comes from our dealings with a couple of the staff. We arrived late at night and the gentleman checking us in was not friendly in the least - whilst he did get us checked in efficiently, his manner was very efficious and ungracious, we almost felt very “lowerclass” and that he was doing us a favour. From one or two other staff during our stay, I asked for information about minor things eg whether the hotel had weighing scales for luggage as one example- their reaction was very much indicated I was rudely interrupting them. I also noticed a couple of male security staff making inappropriate comments about a female guest they found attractive when she was waiting for the elevator - in her earshot - I felt really embarrassed for her and not sure whether Americans still think it’s appropriate to make slimey comments to women, especially in what should be a professional establishment.I think I’d happily stay at the hotel again though.","Clayton, Australia","anniehZ1882IA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clayton, Australia</strong>",7,4.0

That deal turned out NOT to be worth it. I was put in a room very high up which was great but no Times Sq view. Not expected if that was the only issue. The bed was not a real bed, but a Murphy’s bed and extremely hard to get in and out of since the “couch part” which is very hard surrounds 1/2 the bed length! I have a bad knee so this was really tricky. Then reaching for water on my bedside table caused me to slam my forehead into the Murphy bed frame. The chairs were stained. I was here for work, but no desk, just a desk chair which was bizarre. No fridge or microwave. The sink was leaking and dripped all night. Lousy sleep as bed tilts slightly backwards which is disconcerting. Then on top of these issues was the fact that the key cards did not work, the front desk put the wrong room # on my card packet, then I got up at 6 am bc I could not sleep and went down for a muffin. I waited 9 minutes while the staff finished setting up for the morning before they waited on me. Then I took the muffin back up 37 floors only to have the key card not work again. I had to go back down and wait 10 minutes to have a “manager” in a ripped shirt reprogram it very very slowly and accuse me of having an outstanding balance. Yes, for the food I just bought and there was an active credit card on file! No apologies and twice he selected the wrong room number! I would not stay here again and urge people to reconsider and use another hotel. Lesson, if the price is too good, then there is a good reason for that and you should steer clear.

I have to say the rooms were fairly clean and the bed was DIVINE but we had various issues (the phone never worked which was a real pain as we couldn't contact said in-laws apart from on WhatsApp plus we couldn't contact reception either which made me feel really funny. 2 men were sent, one useless and silent, one slightly better but the phone didn't work the whole week plus we had a constantly dripping tap and a leak under the sink which was never remedied.)Every time we went down to reception (we obviously couldn't use the phone!) which was no mean feat in a hotel that size we were sometimes dealt with by rude people, sometimes by quite friendly people but none of the reception staff were really 'on it' and obviously none of our issues were sorted the whole 5 days we were there.Don't get me wrong the Crowne Plaza certainly isn't a bad hotel and as mentioned it was clean and comfortable but it genuinely is the attitude of the staff that makes it an ok hotel as opposed to a great hotel.

Checked my reservation details, nowhere it was mentioned about such service charge at all. The receptionist recognized my Spire/Ambassador member status, but still asked me to go back to check in at 3pm. At 2pm, I saw people were already in line, so I walked up to IHG elite member check in counter, but the staff named Freddie told me to get in another line with other non-members, told me everyone is elite member on the New Year’s Eve. If they have different elite member policy on the New Year’s Eve, the hotel management team should send out the email notifications for such change of policy, so we know what to expect and decide if we want to stay at a hotel with no elite service.For not being able to check in appropriately and I don’t want to get in the long line, I then called the IHG customer service, the agent was surprised to hear such behavior from the check in staff at this hotel and she tried to call the hotel manager to help me to resolve this issue. Finally, after about an hour, the manager named Grant called me and came to the elite member counter to finish my check in at around 4pm. Without saying anything, not any form of apology, instead, the manager repeated saying the same thing just like the staff Freddie, he told me they have over 500 Platinum members on New Year’s Eve, then I asked him how many Spire/Ambassador members he has tonight, he told me Spire/ Platinum is under the same group. No word to say if the manager is thinking this way.As to the king size room is average, clean, with a bathroom not very appealing, hearing people talking while passing by, and even other’s door closing. Spacious room good for a couple, but found no luggage stand. Slippers and bath robe are available upon request. There’s house keeper who is very nice and humble, Not that kind of room design would wow you when entering the room, so no next time I guess.I’ll only stay with hotels with good customer service and recognize their elite member with respect, there’re so many good hotels to choose in New York, why bother this one with an arrogant attitude towards their guests?",,Ginniefan5188,11,1.0

We did a Christmas getaway with our 2 teenagers for 4-days. The price was good and location. We were very busy, as was the staff so I can't say customer service was was good or bad. We did work with the concierge quite a bit and he was awesome. The rooms, were, tired. Many non-working outlets, wallpaper pulling off the wall and the extra blanket we requested, I could have sanded the table I am refinishing with. House keeping was good for us. The rooms are of good size, although having stayed at the Marriott Marquis previously, the room size and quality and superior public spaces, tip heavily in their favor. My main suggestion (bordering on complaint), is really you can't print anything in the business center but a boarding pass? So we would purchase tickets for a show and be told to go to the business center to print them and they charge to print anything like that. Come on, it's a minimum $7.50 to print anything. Also, we were on the elite level, not sure what that meant other than we had a view, we never received water or bar drink coupons like others had spoken of. Lastly, the hotel just isn't very welcoming if that is how I want to describe it. The lobby is small and you can't get through any spaces because the check-in/check out desk is always packed and they do not have one seat anywhere in the lobby so people crowd around everywhere making it difficult to get through. The bar which takes up most of what could be the lobby is corded off and there are signs not allowing patrons in there even when it isn't open. I don't how they can fix this, but a chair or two would make people feel more welcome, especially for the family while mom or dad wait in the long check in/check out lines.",Dublin,"Cooltuck</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin</strong>",27,3.0

This is the second time we have visited New York and the second time we have stayed in Times Square.Before we left, I had looked at the reviews on trip advisor, and despite the multiple positive reviews, it was easy to focus on the small negatives, which made us sceptical.However, I have to say, our whole experience was extremely positive and I would have no reservations in recommending this hotel for a family or couples.We were on the 34th floor with a room viewing North. Some of the bad press for this hotel involved comments about rooms at this level being noisy, even during the night......well, you are in the city that never sleeps and all I can say is, yes you could hear the sirens of the emergency services through the night and the odd car horn, but none of which was enough to keep us awake.Other negative comments were for the tired furniture. I found our room to be very presentable with nothing to complain about. The beds were very comfortable and had fresh linen every day. The bathroom was very clean and again with fresh towels every day. The actual desk had some wear around the edges, but certainly nothing to complain about. I found all the staff that we interacted with to be very friendly, welcoming and accommodating. We actually required to print tickets off for an event and were told we could use the business centre. When we went to the centre, it was under construction. However the staff simply asked us to forward our electronic tickets via email to one of the backroom office staff and they kindly printed the tickets for us. A perfect service which was greatly appreciated.Overall, we found this hotel to be a great base for our week in Manhattan, with friendly staff, clean, tidy rooms and a very central location for uptown and downtown attractions.

This time we were broadsided by their new RESORT FEE of over $30, but were given coupons for drinks and food at their bar/restaurant to soften the add on fee. Our reserved room was not available so after a five minute wait at reception, we were given an ""upgrade"" to the 45th floor. The room was nice, until very noisy neighbors arrived after 1 am and we were woken by their happiness through the thin connecting door. Then the radio alarm woke us up at 6 am, thanks to some previous thoughtless guest. The coupons that we were given was a mixed blessing because the one remaining bar that was open in the early evening, was overfilled with throngs of guests hoping to use their coupons, so finding seating was a challenge. As usual, the food and beverages were excellent, but the whole experience of being forced to pay this new Resort Fee was a total turn off. Note that there was no advance notice given to me when I booked this room using the Annual Voucher that goes with the paid for IHG credit card that I use. Also I recently booked a couple nights stay in February and was not told about this new RESORT fee. The hotel has dropped the ball on how this new and controversial welcome add on fee is being implemented and creates distrust from this otherwise loyal customer.

However, this does not apply to this very Time Square one, very much an outlier or anomaly.The first shock came right at checking. I need to stay 6 nights, and instead of being treated nicer, the check in staff told me that they will charge full amount immediately. Excuse me??? Should the normal procedure to pay desposit and charge only took place at check out? Anyway, I will pay, so no big deal, i paid, and then came another suprise (this place is full of surprise). I found the room is twin bed room, not King bed room I wanted, so I ask for change. The answer is you need to come early tomrrow morning to apply for the change. Excuse me, I ask for change, and if there is room, it should be you help me change room, not me going to lobby the second moring to see my luck. After these 2 pleasant surprise, I decide to stay away from any of these staff in this hotel, just to finished my stay. But, Murphy's Law applied. In the third day of my stay, my credit card stop working, as my 6 nights hotel expenses got charged again, and well over my credit limit. WTF...The less you want to interact with them, the more you got to. So I have to bring that to hotel staff, and here is the answer: Let your bank call us....Sure, thanks, that is so helpful!The next day, luck me, I know New York will have a big snow (turned out to be the biggest in Nov for 136 years), and I need an umbrella for outside activities. I serached the room without finding one (shouldnt a 5 star hotel have an unbrella in room for use), and I call guest service. The answer is We Dont Provide Unmbrelle, but you can buy one from kiosk in B1...What a marvlous hotel that I stayed in..They even have umbrella for sale in kiosk..so convenient....All of that, still not enough to trigger the motivation for write a review, but it seems this hotel loves me so much, they feel obligated to make me remember them in a certain way. After a rush check out and feel great that I finally left this abnormal hotel, I found I left my suit jacket in the room when I land home after 15 hour flight. Unwillingly, I phoned the hotel right away, and luckily they found my jacket (where else can it go). I provide them the shipping address, and that is it...NOBODY is doing anything to ship it back. For 2 weeks, I called several times and no progress. I write email to complain, and all I get was that I need to use a link from their webpage to launch a Lost Report. Excuse me??? I already called and you already found my jacket. Fine, I launched the lost report. Again... nobody is doing anything. I write to complained, and THIS HOTEL did not respond to my complain. What a Excellence Award Hotel that I am dealing withRight now, I have call my colleague to pick the jacket up. Guess what, they did not respond to my colleague, and not responding to the request for fix a time for pick up. Is this CROWNE PlAZA？？？ 2017 Exellnece Award winner？ potential 2018 Excellence Award Contender？？ I should help you fulfil that dream with this revewNormally at the end of review, you will be asked two question:1. How would like to stay in this hotel in the future 1 - 10.. My answer is 0 2. How likely would you recommend this hotel to others 1 -10..

Our only issue with the visit was the cost of the restaurant - specifically Brasserie 1605, which even after using the voucher the front desk gives you when you are a Platinum Ambassador member was $40+ for 2 people.

The shower rod was broken and the toilet paper holder was hanging by a thread. The desk chair had several rips and tears & we even found pieces of old food stuck in the chair!

I see a few other folks on here are complaining about this also. The hairdryer was weak and the toiletries were awful. The conditioner made your hair feel like straw! Food prices at the cafe downstairs were astronomical. We didn’t eat at the breakfast buffet because it was over $30 a person.

The property arrival & parking were easy to navigate but crowded so plan that time in for departure and arrival. We had the two bed plan on the 15th floor. The room was nice and clean. We did not spend a ton of time in the room but in the mornings I heard a consistent knocking sound in the roof area of the 15th Floor in the vicinity of the ""Salon"" room. When I called the front desk sent up maintenance immediately & he informed us that there is a commercial fan in that area and that every time it comes on that is the noise you are hearing; evidently this is a common complaint for this floor on that side. Be aware of the noise issue if you are given a room on the 15th on the ""Salon"" side; its convenient because the pool and gym are also on that floor but maybe ask for the side opposite of the ""Salon"" meeting room to avoid the early morning knocking noise.

I used to enjoy the stay and never had problems. For whatever reason, I had several service problems this year, which suggested that the service is slipping.On the positive side, the standard king room is very spacious -- much larger than the normal NY hotel room. The bed was comfortable and the TV was fine. The service at the front desk at check-in was good, though when I checked out around 7 a.m., there was only one person at the front desk of this very large hotel. The internet was ok.My major gripe is the nonsense service/resort fee of around $30 per night that the hotel charged. As best I can tell, the only value you get for that is a free coffee or water per day and maybe some breakfast which I did not want or need. It is clear that this fee is just a way to make the quoted room rate look lower than it really will be when this fee is tacked on. If it was intended to cover internet charges, they used to provide free internet to member of the frequent guest program (like me), so this is just a hidden price increase. Apart from that, i had several problems and noted several deficiencies that I had not previously experienced, including:1. When I got to my room, there was no lamp on the desk, which made it impossible to work. When I called the desk, they sent up a lamp quickly, whIch I appreciated. The staff member who brought it up and had no idea why there was no lamp in the room. That is a major housekeeping breakdown.2. In addition, when i first went to my room, there was no cover on the part of the door where a guest would swipe the room card -- the innards of the security lock were showing. This was not a practical problem because the card still worked, but it reflected inattentive service.3. The alarm clock went off in the middle of the night on my first night, awakening me. That should never happen.4. The TV froze on my last night so that the remote could not change channels or even turn the TV off without a lot of maneuvering.5. The bathroom seems tired -- older fixtures. Instead of glasses, the bathroom has only plastic cups. Very low-end hotel-like.In all, the hotel is generally ok, but not much better, and the nonsense fee they charge is inexcusable. I'll have to re-think staying here in the future.","Chicago, Illinois","dpster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",64,3.0

When checking in I was told that this was not the case and that the hotel had not charged me the fee and that I was not entitled to the above.

I do feel that the way this hotels runs is in a dishonest/shady/poorly forthcoming manner.At check-in I was also told that I couldn't pay the $30 per night fee either. The other problem was a constant drilling noise heard in my room on one of the mornings. Clearly there was some work being done within the building because there was vibration. When I reported the issue to guest services, I was told that no construction work was being done within the hotel. What she didn't acknowledge was that the building in which Crowne Plaza was situated has other businesses and one is responsible for the comfort of their guests regardless. I wasn't offered anything for the inconvenience e.g. no IHG points, no partial refund or anything like that. And I definitely did not pay $1500 to experience drilling and vibration as part of my vacation. On one of the other days we experienced a problem with the stopper in our sink which was rectified. Overall standards in this hotel have dropped in a ""money-saving"" fashion yet room rates have soared. The quality and quantities of in-room amenities have dwindled - the coffee offered is very mediocre.

Many lower-end IHG hotels e.g. Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express have Keurig Coffee Machines.... this is a $500 per night hotel..that says something.

Lots of nicks and chips on the furniture and big black scrape on the wall. Hallway carpets are quite threadbare in places.Having said that the bed was clean and comfortable, but glad I took some slippers !!Bar was always busy, but very expensive, even for just a quick G&T, and I had to pay about $35/night resort fee, which certainly ramps up the total bill, but I guess it is New York","Staffordshire, United Kingdom","David B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Staffordshire, United Kingdom</strong>",68,3.0

On check in we were greeted by Sandra who speeded through the check in process, explained the resort fee and 'daily bond' however failed to tell me that the 'daily bond' of $75 was debited instantly from my Bank Account. On enquiring a couple of days later after checking my Bank Account, the Manager agreed to waive 2 days resort fees for the inconvenience and to cover any exchange rate fluctuations.Rooms are comfortable and the beds extremely so. Some of the furniture in the room is getting a little tired looking, however room only used as a base to sleep in. We never had a meal in the hotel although did use the take way stall in the hotel for coffee in the morning as coffee provided in the room is not a great quality. If buying water for your room, it is expensive from the hotel so suggest the supermarket up a little from the hotel. We received 4 complimentary vouchers at check in for drinks from the hotel bar which was a nice touch. The resort tax includes international calls, leisure facilities and Wi-Fi. We booked a hotel car to take us back to Newark airport on departure for a flat fee of $95 on recommendation of the porter of the hotel, a fantastic service. Yellow Cabs from JFK airport into Manhattan were all a flat fee of nearly $60. Going back to airport could range from $85 to $120, depending on traffic conditions as meter keeps running in Yellow Cab if stuck in traffic. We would definitely stay at Crowne Plaza, Times Square again due to the location, the duty manager's willingness to listen to correct issues which is very important for customer satisfaction and our overall experience of the hotel.

I picked this hotel due to location, my previous recommendations of this hotel to my customers as well. I also love America and will visit all the time. I’m travelling with my husband, 2 young kids and my mother. So we had two rooms. Firstly the check in line was long with only two people working. My kids became very tired. We get to the desk and I asked if the two rooms could be side by side. I had requested this before arriving. The woman at the front desk began telling me how I haven’t requested it straight away. I’m like no I did but I do understand sometimes it doesn’t come through and that it’s no guruantee anyway. She also mentioned how it was booked like it was a crappy way to book it.She said my room for my husband and I had been upgraded so if I want the rooms next to each other I’ll have to forfeit it. I’m like ok if there next to each other that’s more important.We go up to our rooms and they are not next to each other at all but around the corner. Having two small kids this isn’t great. We go back down straight away. She goes on about how we never request it and that at least we are on the same floor. I’m like that’s not the point, you told me next to each other. She responded with they are and I go no you except it to be physically next to each other not around the corner.I then spoke to the manager on duty who apologised and said it was human error but offered nothing else. As a travel agent I understand how important words are and how sometimes mistakes can happen. But this mistake firstly wasn’t handled properly where the woman was passive aggressive and muttering stuff even as she walked away to get the manager.

We were lucky to have a room with a view overlooking Times Square on floor 32. All the staff (with the exception of the two gentlemen covering the counter at Grounds Coffee bar who were totally miserable and didn’t listen to my order) were very friendly and eager to assist in any way they could.Our room was spacious with an extremely comfy large bed and fabulous shower. We could hear some light traffic noise but not enough to keep us awake at all (and I’m a very light sleeper). We didn’t personally have any issues with the lifts, they get a little busier first thing in the morning but we never waited more than a few minutes. Our bed was made every day and fresh towels provided.We only drank in the bar once (to use our vouchers) but the atmosphere seemed nice and the staff friendly. We didn’t eat at the hotel following advice from others that turned out to be correct that breakfast was quite expensive and nearby delis cheaper. The Business Centre worked well, we were able to print off some tickets without charge (as long as you didn’t go over 5 mins then charges would apply). We utilitised the laundry service after getting caught and drenched in the rain; it was quite expensive but cannot fault the quality of service - we just missed the 10am deadline however the items were collected, washed, dried, ironed and returned within 8 hours.

I decided to roll the dice and take the chance. I'm happy I did, it was a good choice. I surprised my daughter with a weekend in NYC to see the Harry Potter play. I also thought this hotel was a good choice since we were mainly going to be in the theater area. The hotel is super close.The reception staff were niceand welcoming. One of the employees in the morning took her time in explaining where certain things were located and marking on the map places we were interested in seeing. The room was bigger than I thought it was going to be. It was very clean too. The bathroom was small, but that's a given in NYC. The only thing I did not like about the room was where the AC/Heater vent was located. It blew directly onto the right side of the bed. It was either too cold or too hot most of the night for me since I was sleeping on that side. It took a while to figure out which temperature was the best to set it at. Not sure the hotel can do anything to fix this problem. There is a restaurant downstairs which is opened for all meals. Food is served until 10pm. After that its only drinks. Crowne Plaza should offer complimentary water bottles to the guests especially guests who are IHG members. I was expecting water and asked for it, but she didn't want to give it to me at first. Finally she did.

Superbly located on Broadway it is a 2 minute walk to Times Square itself. The nearest subway station is 50th Street, served by the 1 train.As a Platinum Elite member I was given a corner room on a high floor. These rooms provide windows on 2 sides and mine gave me good views of Times Square and Broadway. There are some rooms that offer a view of the Hudson River on one side. There was a king sized bed that was very comfortable indeed and which benefitted from a thick mattress protector that was very soft. There was a spacious, powerful shower in the bathroom. All areas were clean and well maintained. The Crowne Plaza Times Square experiments with different incentives for elite guests from time to time and at the moment offers a $20 discount against food and drink purchased in any of the hotel's outlets by way of vouchers issued at check in. This is an excellent benefit.Breakfast is of good quality however the range of items available is a little less than might be expected. Whilst the restaurant entry desk was often unmanned and leaving guests waiting, the serving staff were quite excellent in their commitment to customer service. Travis, who has been with the hotel for 20+ years and whom I instantly recognised from previous visits, was again a delight to deal with. He was extremely helpful and chatty each day he was on duty.For guests wishing a lighter breakfast or snacks during the day, there is a facility in the 2nd floor, near the lifts, where Items might be purchased.There is a lively bar area where there is a food menu available at certain times of the day. This area was always busy and the service was quite efficient.There is a large gym facility on the 15th floor that is operated by a company separate from the hotel however guests can use it for a small fee and there is complimentary access for IHG Priority Club members. It is a nice facility with a large selection of equipment and classes available. The lower level is currently being refurbished and the temporary changing room/shower area wasn't really adequate for the footfall.Given its location the hotel can be exceptionally busy, particularly at weekends. It seems to function very well and there appears to be strong focus on security.There is a Business Centre, where guests can check in for flights and print airline boarding cards at no cost.I enjoyed a very pleasant and comfortable 5 night stay in October and wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else in New York. I stay in hotels in a private capacity in excess of 100 nights a year and this endorsement does not come lightly. It has been earned by the management and staff over the years.","Accrington, United Kingdom","Robin_Knowles</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Accrington, United Kingdom</strong>",446,5.0

The hotel was pretty average for the amount I paid. The lobby was nice, the room was average, and the amenities were ok. I wasn't looking for a fancy hotel as I knew I would be spending most of my time in NYC outside of the hotel (other than sleeping), so I wasn't expecting much from my experience. No complaints about the physical building or the room/room service (i.e. cleaning). The front desk and customer service, on the other hand, was not ideal. On the last day, I needed to print something in the business center but the computers were not allowing me to open my email to print. I called over the manager (who was very helpful) and she offered to reverse the charges on my credit card and print what I needed on her computer. A couple of days later when I returned home, I went to check my credit card statement to make sure I was refunded and I wasn't. Instead, I was charged 3 times (once by the hotel and twice by a 3rd party service) 75$ for the printing. I called the hotel and on the first call I made, it sounded like whoever was assisting me was reading off a script and did not even attempt to try and understand what I was asking. She told me she couldn't do anything because the manager needed to investigate and check the charges to my account on their end. When the hotel called me back, they were even more useless and told me the only charge they see to my account was the resort fee (which I already knew I was charged for). They couldn't see the other charges and didn't even know the third party that charges for the printing service. She then told me she could reverse the 3rd party charges (without knowing who charged me, which is fine with me as long as I get my money back) but they ""couldn't"" see the other charge the hotel made to my account. She told me the accounting department had to call me back as they are ""experts"" in this. Here is my problem with this 1) I live outside of the USA so I have to call long distance to figure out this nonsense when the manager should have done it days ago. 2) No one at the hotel seems to know anything and they have to keep passing me on to another incompetent person to figure it out.3) How can the front desk see the resort charge they made but not the second charge? every hotel I have ever stayed at were able to see ALL the charges they made to my account (3rd party or not) 4) The staff doesn't know who the 3rd party is charging my account. This baffles me the most as I was about to report my credit card for fraud until my boyfriends reminded me it would be the printing. This is just stupid.

Our room was clean and tidy and bathroom was also well equipped but didn’t have the luxury appearance to warrant 5 stars. Shower was to lie for someone over 5’10 and not to powerful.

The selection of food avaivlable was really good and should accomodate all tastes. We stayed for nine nights, we enjoyed our time staying at the Crown Plaza, we had a room on the 45th floor, the room was nice and quiet. The only complaint we had was the hassle we received from the Nigerian Bus sellers at the doorway as we travelled to and from the hotel. Two of the men were pushing everyday, when we did buy tickets from another vendor a third man started to complain, when we ignored this, he started shouting in the street that we didn't want to speak to black people ( this was not acceptable, he was very angry and agitated as we didn't buy tickets from his team) This is not really the hotels fault, we did highlight this to reception, as we feel no one should be hassled like this after spending a lot of money on a New York City break.

So naturally, a year later (2017) I booked again... Wanting this to be my home away from home with my yearly visits to NYC. I was SO disappointed.The staff: This time, aside from the amazing lady at concierge/guest relations and initial reception member, staff I encountered were sub-par. Reception had this chaotic vibe going, I dealt with 3 different people trying to check in because the room wasn't ready> 1st gentleman - Polite, welcoming, knew we were there for a special occasion - Said we got an upgrade and we’d be ‘very happy with the room’… just had to be cleaned... come back soon.> 2nd staff member - Rushed and rude female - Said room still wasn't ready, didn’t know where the gentleman was didn't see any upgrade note.> 3rd staff member - Flat tone, lackluster attitude - Said room was ready. I get up there only to get the exact room I booked and paid for (no loss as obviously an upgrade is a bonus - it just doesn't seem professional, like they didn't know what was happening).The room (Times Square view): Was not as clean and felt stuffy. The shower was somewhat dirty and had hair from previous guests in the drains. The furniture was falling apart. Literally had maintenance up to fix the issues while I was eating my dinner (Room service from Grind & Co was great).The view, well…….. I can’t fault that, it’s amazing. The Location: Can't fault it. The action is right outside the door. From the fun M&M's store to the famed red TKTS stairs. It's a great choice for that reason and also for the saving grace score/rating given this time.A huge shame, I wanted to love it - Sadly, last month on my annual visit, I opted NOT to stay here again.","Sydney, Australia","MinxiiT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",28,3.0

Transport from buses, metro, cabs, bycicles etc are nearby although you can walk to many of the places of interest. There are numerous theatres located within easy walking distance. So the hotel itself. It does not have a very imposing entrance and the check-in area is quite small. Our first dealing with check-in was unhelpful. I know we arrived early, but I had contacted the hotel prior to let them know and had also indicated on our booking an early arrival. The girl just told us to come back at 3pm (we arrived around 09.45), there was no initial recognition of my Elite Status although I did present my card. We came back around 12 to be told that our room was indeed ready and had a very pleasant guy who was more than helpful. We had a room on the 43rd floor, which we changed as my wife preffered a bath to just a shower, this took some time but the hotel was very good at arranging this. There was not much difference in the standard of the rooms. The beds were comfortable with a selection of pillows, the bathroom ok and the furniture serviceable. Some of it was a little tired. Breakfast was just ok, nothing special and not brilliant for a Crowne Plaza hotel, but this maybe the location. We then had a further issue with the reception when I asked for a late check-out, I was told to ask on the morning of departure, normally Spire members get this, I did ask another reception staff member and was given the extension straight away. So in conclusion a hotel in the heart of the city, reasonable rooms with good beds, a little tired in places and ok food.

Within hours of leaving for the airport i contacted the hotel, reported the item description, colour, size, my room number, via the the appropriate online form that that I was referred to. Seems a simple process - 'someone from the team would be in touch' ... AND my brother in law was staying in the Novotel a few minutes away 3 weeks later - he could collect it! Easy.What a painful experience followed over the next 3 weeks. Many emails from myself followed, that several different named representatives responded to with bland 'cut and paste' sounding phrases, including requests to fill in the form again whose ID I referenced in my emails (!). Several times a request for the Managers email was ignored. None of these confirmed if the item had been found. Perhaps unrelated, but it was interesting how my final email directly referred to my pending TripAdvisor review and my dissatisfaction. Hours later that day I received confirmation they had the item and they sent the form to FedEx it to me with payment details to complete...failing to reference my brother in law. My takeaway here is that the hotel is fine if things go well .... and in my stay of 4 nights on a mix of business/holiday, it worked fine ... until guest services got involved.

It's close to most attractions including Central Park, the Theater District & the Hop On/Hop Off Buses. The Hotel itself is OK with a good bar & restaurant and has a excellent Cafe called Grind & Co. The staff won't exactly woo you with their charm, but they make great Italian Coffee @ acceptable prices for NYC.The rooms at the Crowne Plaza are tired & are needing some renovations. Our toilet sometimes didn't work, the tap come off our shower/bath & sometimes the hot water didn't kick in until after a few minutes. There was no bar fridge in the room either which, on a hot humid NYC day is a must for storing cold beverages. The TV remote was not user friendly and quite frustrating to use.The positives were the beds were comfortable & the room was quiet & the staff were friendly & helpful.In summary, for the price we paid (including all the bullcrap resort & city taxes on top of the sales tax) and for the quality of the room, I would stay elsewhere next time - more likely an airbnb.","Shepparton, Australia","Crack18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shepparton, Australia</strong>",17,3.0

Her warm reception and friendliness set the tone for a great stay. Early check-in: We arrived early and got into our room immediately. That always starts a visit off well. Fantastic location yet quiet room: The hotel was in a perfect spot for hitting the theatres, museums, Central Park and variety of restaurants. Yet, while being in the midst of the hustle of bustle of Times Square, our room on the upper (46th) floor was quiet and comfortable. We also had a nice view from our room.Nicely equipped fitness center: The gym is located on the 16th floor and is full-service, with tons of equipment, a lap pool, and saunas. Convenient bar and grab-n-go service: We received complimentary drink vouchers which we used at the lobby bar. It was a nice environment. The grab-n-go store was perfect for us in the morning. You can get coffee/tea, juice, pastries and light breakfast items if in a hurry. We did not eat lunch or dinner in the hotel, but the restaurant looked nice. Off on a tangent: We had a great vegan dinner at P.S. Kitchen which is right down the street on the same block.My only downside comments are that our bathroom was a little dated. Also, parking is expensive ($85 per night for an SUV). I have stayed at a wide variety of NYC hotels over the years while catching Broadway shows. I wish I had stumbled on the Crowne Plaza sooner. It is just what I was looking for but never quite found.

Honestly cannot fault the room at all - bed amazing, good sized TV perfectly placed, tea and coffee supplied, a safe and all the basic toiletries and towels you could need. Only a shower but that’s pretty standard in NYC.The reception and concierge were lovely without exception.The ONLY thing stopping this from getting 5/5 was a fire alarm went off on my last night (early evening)It kept sounding and then a breathless, extremely panicked sounding man told us over the tannoy to stand by for further instruction. He said this twice and on the second time I decided I did not like the tone and made my way down the fire exit stairs (I was on the 36th floor)I wasn’t the only one as several people were walking down. Once outside we got more info from firefighters than any staff members. We started going back in and still nobody was making any announcements as to what was happening.I realise the alarm was NOT the fault of the hotel and they were probably scared themselves but I do find it odd that nobody could have gone on the tannoy again to say “thanks for your patience, firefighters are still checking”. It would have eased the panic.Once the lifts were working again there was a “it’s fine now” announcement but a drinks or food voucher may have been a nice gesture. Again, not the hotels fault but perhaps could have been handled a bit more delicately.This next part is in no way a reflection on the concierge as they were all gents but one got me a licensed yellow cab and once inside (out of earshot of the hotel staff) the driver obviously could tell I wasn’t American and asked if I was paying cash. When I said yes he said “I won’t run the meter then”Thankfully I have been here numerous times and know it’s a flat $58 plus tolls so made that clear that’s all I would pay him.I wonder if the hotel could start some system like they do at the airports where you get a slip of paper as you get in stating what you will be expected to pay.There’s no way the hotel could know this cab was going to do this but I know it was wrong and I’m sure he’s conned many tourists prior to me getting in his cab.All in all I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again.

No matter what I had read and after all the “don’t stay in Times Square” advices from friends living in New York City, I felt that if you are visiting New York City, this is the best place to stay. I write this after visiting other areas like Soho, Chelsea, Brooklyn. As a tourist Times Square is indeed the place to be and there cannot be a better located hotel than Crown Plaza. This place is buzzing 24x7. There are plenty of Cafés, bars, restaurants, kiosks serving street food, pharmacies, utility stores, supermarkets, bakeries all within walking distance. Empire State Building, Central Park, Grand Terminal, 5th Avenue can easily be reached by walking from the hotel. We walked to all these places and loved it, despite the weather being hot and humid. This is a super busy hotel, yet we were instantly assisted with our luggage by the concierge and they did not charge us anything for bringing our luggage to our room. Yes there was a queue at check in but Donald who checked us in was very efficient and gave us an extremely nice corner room. We booked the hotel on Expedia.com which meant we paid everything ahead and only paid Resort fee of $34.43 per night of our stay at the hotel which was not only mentioned in our expedia.com itenary but also we were clearly told about this at the check-in. They do keep a breakage deposit of $75 per day which is totally refundable at check out.Wi-Fi is free and there is no limit to the number of devices that can be used. They place two bottles of complimentary still water too everyday in the room. The room was bigger than we had expected. The view was a 360 degree view which was spectacular. The room was clean but could have been better. I would recommend a little improvement in this department. Room service is good too but this being a busy hotel you need to show a little patience. Concierge was quite helpful in guiding us whenever we asked. There is a cafe in the building on the same floor as the reception which my husband made use of every morning as the amenities for tea and coffee in the room was not very satisfactory. These are some of the very minute details which I am sure, will be taken care of by the time I visit again. Check out was very quick and absolutely hassel free. The hotel concierge not only helped with the luggage but also got us a taxi for our onward journey. The concierge did not charge us anything for this service also. Not only will I stay in this property in my next visit to New York City but also I am strongly recommending this hotel to anyone reading this review. If you like the buzz, for which New York City is known for, there cannot be a better located hotel than this.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Piyali M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",13,4.0

The rooms were a decent size with 2 double beds. The location was perfect for the places we wanted to visit. We walked everywhere over the course the the 3 days and only used Uber on 2 occasions. The theatre we were going to was literally a 3 minute walk away. We ate and drank in the hotel bar which had nice windows seats looking out over Times Square. The hotel staff seemed friendly and efficient with exception to x1 lady who we dealt with on arrival who could have been friendlier and less stern! We had breakfast across the road at ‘Juniors’ which was amazing and set us up for Long busy days out and about in the city. I do agree the hop on hop off bus sellers outside the hotel door every time you go in and out gets annoying and the fact you are made to pay for a gym and pool (which we did not use) is a bit rich. Maybe if more value was inbuilt into these fees for people who do not use the pool and gym it would be received better.

So not really 'free' is it?Location is great, couldn't be better. The cleaning of the rooms needs some serious attention. Window sills NEVER cleaned in the 6 nights we stayed and had a growing collection of some sort of flies daily. Skirting boards filthy, and a significant amount of dust and fluff behind all furniture and at the edges of the carpets, even clothing tags from a previous occupant behind the bedside table. However the bathroom seemed to be cleaned ok. I did think about complaining but the non friendly faces from the reception staff and dismissiveness when I did speak to them, the lengthly queues when I really wanted to be out enjoying New York really wasnt worth my effort. Would I stay again? No, I know there are better hotels out there and wished in hind sight I booked another.

Our stay at the Crowne Plaza Times Square was made exceptional due to one person – Emily. I do not commonly writer reviews but I was compelled to write a review because of how amazing Emily was. She took such good care of our family. We began our visit to NYC staying at a different hotel, which was not good and was making our NYC experience unpleasant. They had poor customer service and the hotel itself was not nice. So we came by the Crowne Plaza Times Square hotel to take a look. Emily happened to be the one who helped us at the front desk and even showed us a few rooms so we could compare to the hotel we were staying in. The rooms were great and the customer service that Emily was providing was fantastic, and so much better than the hotel we were staying in so we decided to cancel our other hotel and move over to the Crowne Plaza Times Square. Now, we did have some minor issues during our multi day stay with them but each time Emily quickly took care of things for us. She was simply amazing - superb customer service. I do not know if she is thinking of moving up into a managerial position but if she is they should definitely promote her. She really knew her stuff, and was quickly able to address our questions and find solutions to any issues we had. Also she was simply a pleasure and joy to work with. She was very personable and seemed to truly care about our experience and wanted to make sure everything was perfect for our stay.

We stayed more than 8 days and we had to eat the same low quality food.One day we asked to have an espresso and cappuccino, instead of the usual americano coffee, and they asked to charge additional 17 USD by saying that was not included in the standard breakfast (normally charged at 35USD when purchased separately from the room).The restaurant has windows on a nice view on the 7avenue just near times square, but the glasses are dirty, so you can’t really take a good picture.In the business centre the computers can only be used free for airport checking in. Everything else, including the use of windows office, internet, or printing, is to be paid; first time I see it in an hotel.ATM machine inside the hotel charges 12 USD, and you only know after getting the money, without pre information. I used an ATM machine in the JFK airport and it is only 3USD; I think in the city is even less that.

I had to call the bank and block the card, to avoid continuous charging, despite I asked them to not do it.The staff at reception is not friendly at all, sometimes arrogant.

We usually stay in this general area as we love the convenience of the subway to Flushing Meadows and the vibrancy of Times Square - the hotel certainly is well located! We were greeted promptly at checkin and were very pleased with the room being ready for early checkin. The staff were wonderful: pleasant, friendly, professional, courteous, and personable; in spite of the fact that he introduced an UNEXPECTED SERVICE fee which was NOT disclosed upon booking the room. As a Platinum Ambassador, I was shocked at this disclosure at checkin! The entire hotel industry has started to introduce all these hidden fees (they are not openly disclosed when making a reservation) and deceptive pricing practices. I guess they are going the budget airline route which I do not expect from a hotel chain such as Crowne Plaza. But I am sure they are giving these fees directly to their staff for their wonderful service. Note to hotel chain, if you need a higher price, simply propose a higher rate - if I encounter this again, I will not darken your door or the door of any hotel in your entire chain again. The service throughout the hotel was excellent, very friendly and timely service. Our city view room was great with nice size and comfortable bed - I need extra pillows for sleeping and this was immediately accommodated upon request. One thing I will complain about is the large screen TV over the lobby bar area as it cannot keep up with the speed of broadcast so action scenes are always distorted (must be a 60hz refresh rate)! This is unbelievable and I teased the bartender to please stop at a Best Buy on the way in to replace this antiquated set! We could not watch it as it made me ill. Outside of the unexpected “Service fee” and lousy bar TV, we loved this stay and will look to stay here again next year (hopefully they will replace the TV in the bar area).

The Crowne Plaza Times Square checks all the boxes. My wife, son, and I stayed in this hotel Aug. 29-Sept. 1 and were absolutely delighted with our stay. First of all, the hotel is in an excellent location. It is directly in times square, within walking distance of many fine restaurants, as well as Central Park and the Rockefeller Center. We used the excellent Big Bus Hop On-Hop Off bus tour that we ordered directly in front of the hotel. The tour begins in Times Square. The front desk was terrific, specifically the two young ladies we dealt with Victoria and Vanessa. They were accomodating, courteous, personable, and patient. We were on the 43rd floor on the IHG Elite level with a spectacular view of Times Square. The floor was very quiet despite being across from the elevator. The room was spotless, well maintained, and quite spacious for a Manhattan hotel. The cleaning ladies were efficient and friendly. All the toiletries were replenished promptly, and the shower and toilet worked flawlessly. As part of our reservation, we received 2 free drinks at the hotel bar located in the spotless and meticulously clean lobby. The bell hops graciously flagged down a taxi when we needed one.

So the cab let me off at the corner with was wrong. Then we walked wrong way to the closed door. Walked around to the under inside entrance. Checked in right away. Very fast. Went to the room 3715. Was a Fantastic view!! On the corner!!! Everything was clean. Walked into the bathroom and there was mold on the shower ceiling. Later that day around 6 pm we requested a change of towels. We came back around 9 pm and still no towels. We called again to find the front desk gentleman to have the typical ny attitude. “ I’ll check into it “ so we went out to a show and came back around midnight and still no towels. Called again. Same attitude. So we went out to check time square and enjoyed ourselves. Upon return there was no security which I didn’t like. Anyone could come in and out. So back to the room and still no towels. Called AGAIN AND FACED WITH THE SAME ATTITUDE! 15 minutes later at approx 230 am I received my towels. There was no breakfast or room service till 439 pm. So we ordered from a local Resturaunt and we had to go down to pick up our food. Last upon leaving the older black bellhop with the white shirt was on his phone. I told him we needed a taxi but he was on the phone. I went to get a taxi myself and wow wait till u hear this! The first taxi driver told me he had been waiting for three hours for a fair and to go to the second taxi guy I then proceeded to go to the second taxi guy in line and he told me to go to the last taxi guy which was four cars away I went to the last taxi driver and he told me that I had to go back to the first driver because that was the rules. If I’m going back to the first guy he said no I’m waiting for this other guy for hours and he’s going to take the fair because it’s an out of town fair. I then went back to the bellhop and yelled at him again to get off his phone and he wouldn’t so I yelled at the taxi driver and then went and he helped me hail a separate cab that was not even in the line. This was a four minutes screaming session between me yelling at the bellhop to get off his phone me yelling at the taxi driver that he’s the first in line and you take me and at the other taxi drivers that didn’t even want the fair. What a horrible experience. I later found out from the taxi cab that we held that we should’ve called the city to complain but we were already late for the airport.So all in all the hotel was nice just a few quirks. ,"Fort Myers, Florida","DamonL69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Myers, Florida</strong>",12,4.0

We went to Juniors the next morning and the food was 100x better, and was nearly $70 cheaper which is crazy! Drinks and all! The customer service was rather lousy and the people working at the restaurant didn’t give us a kind smile or welcomed us, in fact, they just stared a lot. We vowed to never have breakfast there again. The rooms were nice and large, the view was mediocre for such an expensive space and the rooms were pretty clean, apart from a few spillages up the walls in the bathroom. If you don’t have thousands of dollars to spend please do not come here. Otherwise, if you don’t mind ignorant staff, you should visit.

We took an Uber to the hotel. We knew check-in would be much later, but the head receptionist was really helpful and allowed us to “Pre check-in” which meant we had a key to use the facilities in the public areas. The doorman was also really helpful and held our luggage securely until we were allocated a room. We visited a few tourist attractions (Central Park wasn’t too far away) and had a coffee in Times Square. When we returned at noon, we were informed that the two double room we booked was still unavailable, but we could opt to have a king size room with a temporary bed for our 15 year old daughter. We were assured that the temporary be was comfortable and would be large enough for an adult. We were so tired, having been awake since 3am, that we agreed. Our luggage was to be brought to our room. The room was totally below the standard I expected from a hotel of this calibre. The duvet was grubby and there were what I can only assume were claw marks in the headboard. The pillows were propped up against the worst of the damage. I’m amazed the hotel felt this room was adequate for paying guests. We immediately called guest services to request an alternative room. They were apologetic and agreed to have reception call us to arrange another room. Communication between departments appeared not to exist. Within minutes, a bed was being delivered for our daughter. We sent it away. Then our luggage was brought up. Guest services agreed we could use the bathroom to freshen up while we waited for another room and that they would transfer our luggage for us. To be fair to the hotel, they did arrange another room and they did transfer our luggage while we were out for the afternoon. The two double room on 27th floor was both clean and spacious. However, I was surprised that we could still hear traffic noise through the window. The public bar was lovely and the cafe by reception looked fantastic. I’m disappointed that I didn’t get around to sampling the most enormous cheesecake I’ve ever seen. All staff were really helpful and the hotel is in a perfect location for tourism. I would definitely visit this hotel in future.","Droitwich, United Kingdom","Janie977</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Droitwich, United Kingdom</strong>",9,3.0

It's really Times Square.I had asked for early check in as an IHG Platinum but that didn't work out. Well it happens. So we went downstairs to drop off the bags and it's pandemonium: the line reaches almost out the door. Took us almost half an hour to get rid of a small roller board. Same pandemonium at check out, but fortunately we didn't need to store our bag. Lobby is cramped, often overfilled and the front desk has significant wait times even at the Elite desk (if it's staffed in the first place). We later get into the room and it's fine. Reasonably spacious with a functional layout and some view of the river. Some furniture like the desk or the ""office"" chair showed some severe wear and tear but overall ok.Here is the main downside. The hotel was advertised at $160/night and ended up costing almost $230. That's more than 40% on top of the price that showed on the IHG website. Most of this is due to that bogus ""resort fee"". To be fair, it's disclosed before you hit ""book"" but not before you actually do a price comparison to your budget and other hotels. They try to justify it with some fringe benefits that even Motel 6 will give you for free: WIFI, free calling (really!), use of the gym. The only thing of some minor value is a drink coupon. But beware: it's only good for beer for house wine, none any of their fancy drinks. If you think these benefits are so valuable: charge extra, but let the customer decide what they want to buy or not. These fringe benefits actually makes the practice even harder to stomach: it assumes that the customer is stupid and doesn't get what's really happening. Let's be honest here: The resort fee serves one and only one purpose alone: to be able to advertise an artificially low room rate which has nothing to do with the price the customer is supposed to pay at the end. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has received multiple complaints about this practice and strongly discouraged hotels to advertise rooms this way. It's not entirely clear whether it's legal and the FTC is considering updating their regulations. (I can't post a link here, but it's easy to google)Advice to management: don't do this. Your hotel is in a great location, so be proud of it charge what you want to charge. Intentionally misleading customers may get you a few extra clicks, but it also aggravates existing customers, potentially deters new ones and results in bad reviews.

Knowing I had to stay here now for work still makes me a bit iffy. Look, there's only one rule for tourists...""Don't stop and keep moving.""Now getting back to this hotel. I suppose the price is right for NYC, everything here is expensive. On the other hand, for what you pay, the quality is outstanding. I'm biased to the West Side and Hell's Kitchen. For me, there's not a better spot to be in that is an easy escape from the Vegas of the East Coast.I also want to add in something about the food/room service. I stay here enough that I don't need to order in, but I have to say that the quality of the food that's delivered from ""Grind & Co."" is damn good. What's often missed on in room dining is simplicity. Sometimes all I want is a nice deli sandwich and why not? I'm in NYC.So if you're coming here for work or your working through a vacation, it's a great place. Accessible to every place that you need to be near. Once you get going to wherever it is you want to see, don't stop...just keep moving.

We chose to stay at the Crowne Plaza and even paid extra to change our hotel due to the location, which is excellent. It is literally right on Times Square, the hub of all the action, We were allocated rooms on the 39th floor (my sister in law cannot easily take heights so she found this rather distressing).The lift made our ears pop. Our first shock came when we were told that we would have to pay $30 per night per room ""service charge"". This apparently is to pay for the 'free' internet, 'free' local and international calls and 'free' use of the spa. We had not been advised this by our travel agent. Apparently it is in the small print of a number of NY hotels (so beware when you book). It cannot be waived. We complained to the reception manager - he gave us two free breakfasts and advised us that he would upgrade our rooms next day. My sister-in-law was offered a room on the 20th floor; the desk manager advised us to stay in our corner room as it had a great view and would be better than any other room he could allocate. We thanked him and said we would leave our room as is. Imagine our shock when we found a chambermaid cleaning our room which had been cleared of our cases (it was 7pm). The receptionist was very apologetic; referred this to a senior colleague who found they had been moved to a room on the 18th floor. Another two breakfasts and a complimentary drink were offered as compensation. We were so relieved to locate our luggage (and to find that the safe containing our valuables had not been opened) that we accepted the 'gesture'.The irony is that upon checking out we found that there was nothing to pay; apparently the 'service charge' had been paid upfront - so was part of the package deal that we had already paid for. If only the communication had been better we would not have been subject to such annoyance and stress and our review would have been so different.","Harrow, United Kingdom","LondonCitytraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Harrow, United Kingdom</strong>",120,2.0

We picked this hotel for location and we were right (and wrong) to do so. The location is right next to Times Square so you are handy for most things, especially the subway (for all directions).However, there are a couple of points (that other visitors have made too and I noticed before we left) that make this not an ""excellent"" review and instead a ""very good"" one - our room whilst a good size and the AC was amazing (the time we went New York had a heatwave and so it was a pleasant respite to get back to our room at the end of the day), was a little dated looking and there were things like the headboard was scratched (when you moved the pillows), the room looked a little ""tired"" overall and when my son dropped a small piece of Lego on the floor (and I had to put on the torch on my phone to find it) I saw that there was litter behind the bed that obviously had been there for some time - making me think, when was it last hoovered?? These are only minor points though but its the little things that catch your eye that make you think ""hhm?"". The other point was the people standing outside the doors trying to sell you tour buses - we lost count of the amount of times we had to say ""excuse me"" to get in the doorway - there is another side to the pavement that they could stand at, and not be right outside the doors ready to pounce as soon as you exit - and this was EVERY day.One other point would be when checking in, that maybe the staff could tell you which floor you were staying on, as we didn't know and didn't know which lift to get to our floor (although it was pointed out to me when I returned to reception to find that out).We didn't eat in the hotel, so can't comment on the food, but we did have a drink most nights in the hotel bar, where the service was great, staff all lovely and ready to help with anything we needed.Overall we had a good stay and I would recommend it.","Falkirk, United Kingdom","Joyce S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Falkirk, United Kingdom</strong>",23,4.0

The location was phenomenal! In the midst of all the action. We got there at 9pm at night due to 2 delayed flights. The hotel was accommodating to this need. We checked in and the room was waiting for us. We were on the 17th floor with a view of time square. The room was clean. I do think a little make over wouldn’t hurt as the headboards are made of a material that is tearing and looks a little shabby. The bathroom was regular. Nothing too bad to complain about. The beds were comfortable for me and my family of 4. We were also offered 4 $20 vouchers for our stay for food at the hotel. It came in handy for water that we got daily to stay hydrated while on the go in New York City! The hotel is located right in time square. All the attractions were in walking distance and the hop on hop off bus for the further attractions was at the corner of the hotel. So all in all I would recommend this hotel. I didn’t have hidden fees because I asked when booking for the total cost with all fees included( a lot of reviews say they weren’t told about the daily charge so I made sure to get that information up front). The hotel staff was very nice and helpful. Any request we had was honored in a fast manner. This is a good stay if you want to be near all the action!

The location of this hotel could not be any better! Central to many popular attractions and the cruise port (did a four day cruise to Bermuda from here) was perfect for us! The hotel was clean and the staff was professional, unfortunately until the last staff member we had to interact with. After a four night stay, on the morning of check out we (family of 4) with all of our luggage needed a larger van type taxi to the cruise port. We asked the gentleman at the podium of the garage entrance to the hotel if he could help us with that. He said he would, only to find him helping other guests that approached him after us. He then sent us outside with all of our luggage (5 pieces) to seek the help of another employee that we could not find! When my husband went back in to tell him this person wasn’t out there he proceeded to try and have us take one of the hotel cars which wanted to charge us $60-$70!!!! We knew that option was the more expensive choice which is why we asked for a taxi! We’ve traveled all over the world, what we were asking was not unusual. He literally just did not want to help us and left us standing there to fend for ourselves! I was absolutely shocked by his dismissive demeanor toward us. From the garage of this hotel, it is not easy to simply flag down a taxi cab especially when you need the larger van cab but that’s exactly what we had to do BUT it only cost us $17 versus the $60-$70 the hotel car service wanted!

The hotel is right in the middle of the action and literally a stones throw from Time Square. Great location! Unfortunately there is not that much more positive to say, except that I thought the hotel restaurant was reasonably priced and the food was decent! It felt a bit like one was staying in a boarding hostel as there isn’t really a normal foyer or reception area. When you come off the street there is an escalator that takes you up a flight and one inevitably passes straight to the lifts to your room unless you are visiting the restaurant or bar. Our one experience at the bar was also pretty strange as the barman didn’t want to serve anyone at the bar unless you were sitting at the bar, if you were sitting in the restaurant you had to wait for the waitress to take your drinks order...which frustrated a few guests in the short time we were there after we had moved from the restaurant to the bar so we could be served. The room was also not very clean on arrival and on one day our room hadn’t been serviced by 4pm, and we had to call for it to be cleaned. Overall the room is not too bad and the bed is comfortable.If you simply want a comfortable bed to sleep in near Time Square and you are not too fussed about what I have said here, then this is your spot.","Port Elizabeth, South Africa","jeannepgen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port Elizabeth, South Africa</strong>",0,2.0

Once we got to the hotel and checked in we were very happy with our room, it was pretty high up and had an amazing view toward the Hudson and into Times Square. As we got there fairly late we just wanted to get to bed, when I pulled the sheets back the middle of the bed was wet, I called down to reception and they said someone would come and change the sheets, this didn't happen as we waited over 20mins, there was also a strange noise like a lifts going up and down but our room wasn't near the lift...anyway I went to reception and asked if we could change rooms as the mattress was also wet and the noise was loud enough and constant enough to be annoying for the next five days. I was given three choices two rooms without a view which looked onto brickwork and another corner room a few floors below ours. I chose the corner as my wife had paid for it. I thought the noise had gone but unfortunately I could still hear it and did for the duration of our stay which put a bit of a downer on the experience really. We wanted to print some tickets for a day out we were having so we used the computers in the lobby which you have to pre pay for but you don't get charged until you go over 10 minutes. We didn't go over 10 minutes but still got charged. We went to reception to ask for a refund but were given a number to call and would a get a refund over the phone. No one answered although I called multiple times, and the reception staff were not interested. I thought the water from the café was really expensive too. Overall the hotel is nice, the rooms are clean and like I said we had a great view in a great location. The noise was just the let down factor for me and obviously having a wet bed was a bit rubbish.","Leicester, United Kingdom","dan c</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leicester, United Kingdom</strong>",3,3.0

This hotel located across the street from the M&M store at Times Square. The lobby is on the second floor and is right next to the bar. There is not a lot of seats for family to wait for the person to check in. We were on the 23 rd floor facing Times Square. View was pretty cool. You can see the steps over the TKTS booth and the Good Morning America studio window from our room. They must have just replaced the mirror in the restroom because it was blue painters tape on the corners of the mirror. Two days in a row we had to call down to ask for wash cloths as we had none. They brought up a whole set of towels up. They didn’t have a floor mat two of the days we stayed. And the second day we were there the shower head was facing outward so when we turned on the water it go the floor wet and had to use a towel to soak it up. The second night we were there we realized how thin the walls are. We heard our drunk neighbors clear conversation and how mush of a sailors vocabulary they had. We could hear their voices moving from one side to the room to the other. They also sounded like they were right outside our window, imposible because we were on the 23rd floor. It took me a moment to realize that the windows can open inward a little and that they were by their window smoking. This is the reason we could hear them so clearly on that end of the room. You could smell the sweet smoke from out room. One of the nights we woke up with the sounds of the female guess puking her guts out. They did give out $20 food vouchers for everyday we were there and two drink vouchers. The restaurant doesn’t stay open late and their continental breakfast buffet was $40 per person. Use the $20 voucher and get some pastries, coffee and fruit instead at the grind &co next to the elevators. We were able to set up a car to take us to the airport that same morning we were leaving. Concierge was not open yet and the bellhop was able to set it up for me downstairs. Very helpful. It was $95 for a large SUV to pick us up and all of our luggage.

I booked about eight months in advance with a free cancellation option, and checked frequently to get a lower rate. It didn't happen, so I would advise to book early. The location was a quick walking distance from numerous Broadway shows and, of course, the TKTS Times Square location, which can likely be seen from your window. The windows opened a teeny bit inward should you want fresh air, but wouldn't enable even the tiniest of toddlers to slip out and fall. The seal on the window left something to be desired, as the road noise was almost unbearable, and I fall asleep easily. We arrived prior to check in since we got off the cruise ship in the morning, but the bellman gladly checked our bags and stored them until we returned to the hotel once our room was ready. The stay was uneventful, as the room was made up efficiently during the day in our absence, but there was an error where the front desk clerk only put a two night stay on our room keys rather than three. This made it interesting when we were on the 19th floor and pressed for time, and had to trek back to the lobby to rectify the mistake. No big deal, but...""you had one job."" We summoned a bellman the morning of our departure when we had an outgoing flight to catch, and after waiting 15 minutes at 6:30 in the morning, we finally lost patience and schlepped our six bags and two teenagers downstairs to the cab stand ourselves. At that point the bellman asked us if we would like the convenience of a hotel car to transport us, for much more than a cab would cost. No, thanks. The cab was there in a flash. Checkout was a breeze and our stay was overall pleasant and conveniently located.","St. Petersburg, Florida","GoBucsGoRays</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Petersburg, Florida</strong>",81,4.0

It took six buses to carry us to all of the locations. The Hotel doesn't have much ""street space"" but they utilize what they have to perfection. Our buses had no problems getting us into and out of the hotel. This is a HUGE hotel that lives up to its four star status (or should be). Our room (4212) was ADA compliant had had wheelchair access in the toilet area. The fold down wooden seat and adjustable shower head was extremely nice. The curtain rod at the top had a ""peg"" that held a ring and kept the water in the shower. The room had a wonderful view that included the part of the Hudson River where the airliner that landed on the Hudson came to rest. The windows are ""one way"" so there was no problems with privacy. This room is a handicap accessible room and right next to the elevators -- we never heard them. Even the street noises were minimal and we were one block from a fire station. There was plenty of room inside the room to park the electric scooter out of the way. Housekeeping kept it spotless. The hotel met all of our ADA needs without any complaining. We could not have asked for a nicer hotel staff -- especially Johnny (Concierge), and Kelly and Grant on the front desk). One of the nicest things about this hotel is the full Concierge service during the day and 24 hour accessibility to ""bell hops"" to help with luggage. It was their Concierge service that connected me with Big Apple Mobility so I could rent, for a very reasonable rate, an electric scooter so I could keep up with the group. (Note: even the hop-on-hop off ""topless"" tour buses accommodated the scooter -- as did the street corners). The hotel accepted the scooter before I arrived and held onto it after we left for pickup. Can't ask for better service than that. The beds were extremely comfortable and faced the huge picture glass windows. There were also plenty of electrical outlets (however, we do recommend that you bring a ""gang"" set of outlets if you have a large number of ""things"" that need power. The desk area was very functional and the office chair comfortable. I'm glad the tour group picked this hotel for our mission trip.

Have to walk through 5-6 men which is not nice!- Concierge got a taxi for us after we asked, pulled our suitcases along and put them in the trunk for us. Cons: (This is what you most want to read)- Unexpected 'Resort fees' at time of checking in. $30 per night to use the gym and international calls pretty much. Never used either, but still have to pay. We were told we may have to pay this if it was included in the room rate - it wasn't. Managers were very unaccommodating about it and very rude. None of that American 'Customer is always right' or even 'customers get smiles' malarky. Rude, grunting and unhappy is the best word I can use to describe them.- Came home to this bill, been charged the new $34 fee. This was not what it was meant to be when we booked.- So we've now had to pay out an extra £186 for something we should never have had to pay for.- Hotel is used by locals for the gym and pool. Good luck trying to get a lift at lunch or after they finish work!- We had a room near Times Square near the top floor. You could still hear sirens well into the night and early in the morning.- The room itself is not worth 4*s. We had a room with cupboards that were falling apart and did not close properly, and were the old dark wood that most homes had in the 90's. - Requested our linens be cleaned most days, but they weren't. There was a mark on one of the sheets which was there for at least 3 days.- The headboard of the bed was old and scratchy where the leather (I'm assuming leather) was starting to crack and peel.- 'Premium TV' is not accurate. 3 channels didn't work, you got 4 news channels who only ever spoke of Donald Trump, HBO, History and National Geographic were the only okay ones.- The on-site restaurant is okay.

The spectacular night lights from all the tall buildings and visitors walking in the streets kept everyone awake each night in awe about New York City.

First time staying in this Crowne Plaza and this is our impression.RESERVATIONS: This time, IHG Central Reservation and Ambassador Customer Service left us with a bitter taste. I don’t know what happened, may be it wasn’t my day or I wasn’t lucky this time. I called several time and talked to Sheryl, Zack and Bryan asking about the resort fee or facility fee of $30 that it was mentioned in my booking, their response was vague, I asked them if being loyal to IHG chain for more that ten years (stayed at IHG in different cities, just to mention, Prague, Rome, Mexico, Bogota, Barcelona, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, Paris and soon Lisboa…) and for being Platinum Ambassador member “as courtesy” they can do something about it, their answer were NO, they said ""everybody pays for it"", not satisfied with their answer, I asked to speak with someone else, and the just limited to say..""Contact the hotel"" that was like brushoff off their responsibility. For me more than unapologetic, it was like "" I don't care"". I had to contacted the hotel and the answer was..""You have to pay for it"", after all these unsuccessful attempt to speak with someone nice, I just told my partner, ""that's ok, it's just $30 bucks"".CHECK IN: We arrived around 1pm; We were running kind of late for a Broadway show, the lady at the counter checked us in a very fast and efficiently way, I barely remember her name, I think is Elizabeth, she was so charming and professional, very friendly and with a nice attitude towards us, even those we were in the hurry ( we had to catch a Broadway show), she took her time and had a little chit chat with us and… guess what?..She informed us that we don’t pay for the facility fee because we booked this hotel room months ago before the IHG change their policies and, I asked myself…why I didn’t get that answer from Central Reservations, Hotel Receptionist and Ambassador Customer Care when I called???...mmmhhh....Anyway, the room that she gave us was stunning, clean, perfect for our Anniversary celebration, yes, we were celebrating 25 years of being together and we decided to stay one night in the city. The view from the room was breathtaking. Nice job...!BREAKFAST: At check in she offered us a Breakfast voucher with a discounted prize of $16 per person (usually breakfast is $40 per person) for being Platinum member, in case we wanted to have Breakfast at the Brasserie 106, but we didn’t have time to stop by. Nice gesture..!THE CONS: The AC unit did not work well. We literally woke up sweating trying to adjust it, but it was impossible, if this happens to you, please report to the Reception,don't let it pass as we did.

I'm a platinum IHG member so we used points for our stay. I was shocked at check-in to learn that we would still have to pay some expensive service fees and taxes despite the use of points. I've stayed at Hilton, Marriott, and IHG properties all over the US and Europe using points and have never paid an additional dime for my stays (unless I accrued other expenses). I'm actually still confused about some of the charges on my credit card, even after talking to the front desk twice. We were given some vouchers and discounts for food and drinks at the hotel for being platinum members, and we only used a few of them to get breakfast from the little bakery area (the chocolate croissants were yummy). The main selling point for this hotel is certainly the location. It is right in Times Square and couldn't be more convenient. We walked to restaurants, the Empire State Building (about a mile), and to Phantom of the Opera. Subway stops are also well-located which we used to go to the 9/11 Memorial and to come back from Little Italy and Chinatown. We did pay $12 per night to be upgraded to a room with a view, and we were put on the 45th floor (second highest floor) with some city views. We never had an issue with the elevators and they worked quickly. We could hear street noise all the way up there, but it didn't interrupt our sleep. If you're on lower levels, you may want to pack a small sound machine. The room did have some wear and tear. My sister initially thought the bathtub hadn't been cleaned, but it was actually stained, mostly with splattered paint! The headboard of my bed also had paint on it! Very strange. The internet was down for almost a whole day which was frustrating. Overall, our stay was fine but not impressive.

They were extremely comfortable with 4 pillows each both softer and firm pillows to choose from. The room was clean and spacious. Not like most NYC hotel rooms which are small and cramped. There was a safe that fit our electronics, jewelry, etc. with extra room. All we missed was a refrigerator. We were told if it is required for medicine it is free but if you want to rent one it's $3.00 per day. We received a coupon for a free drink in the bar (house wine, beer or soft drink). We later found out it was also for juice, soda, etc. in the small grab and go café (Grinder) near the elevators. We used one there for a bottle of orange juice in the morning. Housekeeping was great about leaving soap, and shampoos. Twice we came back to a clean room with no washcloths. I'm sure it was an oversight and easily fixed. They delivered free water bottles upon request a couple of times. The air conditioner was independent so we were able to turn it down and up and it felt like we did rather than centrally controlled somewhere else on the property. We did not hear our neighbors. The location is great. We walked to the two Broadway Shows we attended. We walked to the Hop on Hop off bus. Even walked to the Today Show.If you use the concierge and order Show tickets through them, pick up your tickets from that desk.

Everything we needed was in walking distance, and the view of the city at night all light up was spectacular! The staff is super nice and helpful. It was our 1st trip that included storing our luggage and valet parking (we're simple folks!). The hotel has an on-site health club, and because of that we were forced to pay extra at check in to use it as a day guest. The pool is considered part of the club, so it closed at 6pm, which was upsetting. We also had to pay for wi-fi, so between the health club and wi-fi, it was a lot to add on, plus we didn't use either one! Parking is under the hotel by valet, so that was an additional charge as well. I did use Priceline and totally lucked out on my room though. My ""standard room"" was actually on the 22nd floor- a king bed with a chaise lounge and still large enough for a twin air mattress. Plus, we got vouchers for 2 free alcoholic beverages as well! No micro or fridge though. Very clean, and spacious, and the bed was sooo cozy! Could easily have spent more than 1 night there. Check in was 3 pm, check out 11am, but you pay parking by the 24 hour period. We left at 11am and had the bell hop hold our luggage while we wandered around NYC until 3pm. When we returned they pointed to our luggage, but when I handed them a tip, they were more than happy to get our luggage, cart it, and wheel it out the door! Car arrived within 30 seconds.

We usually don't go to restaurants in hotels so this hotel should truly appreciate him because we wouldn't have spent hundreds of dollars there otherwise. Would have given this hotel an excellent rating except for two things:1. They sometimes had someone checking hotels cards at night to ensure the safety of their guests and make sure nobody was coming in if they weren't staying there. Considering there were homeless people fighting outside twice (it's time square, expect to see these things anywhere you stay), they should have been there the whole night. Only saw them checking twice out of our 5 night stay.2. They should be much clearer that there is a fitness club with a pool that they give their guests access to use. Not a hotel with a gym. This is not a fun leisurely pool to look forward to after a long hard day. Have to wear a hair cap and swim in the lanes. Do not stay here for the pool.

We also liked the advertised size of the rooms and the Crowne reputation. Though a minor speed bump at the start, resolved speedily and eloquently by Vanessa, our stay was purely delightful. Upon arrival we were disappointed to learn that the room assigned us was a smaller double, and the hotel was booked. With poise and professionalism, Vanessa relocated us to the 44th floor and a king room overlooking the Hudson. For a 5-night stay, the smaller room would have been claustrophobic, but the larger was perfect. It was adjacent to the elevator--and we never heard it! The shower in the upgraded rooms is to die for--water pressure and shower head are phenomenal. The bed, though I thought it looked like it would be far too soft, enveloped my body for perfect nights of rest. And not to end there, on the birthday girl's special day Vanessa had delivered a mouth-watering piece of Jason's Red Velvet cake with a bottle of champagne. Classy.I used the concierge a number of times. They too were courteous, knowledgeable and thorough.Last is the location. While some might shy away from Times Square, this hotel is maybe 5 blocks north, right in the theater district. It was perfect for the theater, access to key subway lines, and a pleasant walk to Central Park or around Manhattan. It served as a perfect central base camp.

(sorry, I won't tell you the room number or I may not get it again!).Second - a warm greeting and offer for extended checkout on Sunday - allowed us to leave all our stuff there till 2:30 - very considerate (disclaimer, Spire status will get you some of these perks).MOST IMPORTANT - shout out to Martin at the bar. Martin is one of the regular bartenders when I'm there during the week, and always remembers me by name with a friendly greeting. He made us feel VERY welcome when we got there late Friday night,, so much that we were there after the show as well on Saturday.

The rooms have excellent views of the city and Hudson River.Food and Bar: I'm usually skeptical of hotel food - and being in New York, there are plenty of amazing restaurants so always a great reason to go out - but I find that at least one night during a multi-night trip, I'll have dinner at the bar (broadway 49 bar & lounge) because the food is outstanding! My favorite items on the menu are the grilled chicken sandwich with cheese, avocado, and bacon; the grilled steak salad; quesadillas; and basically everything for dessert! Truth be told - I'll usually stop for a drink before heading to bed if I went out for dinner because the bar is really unique (the bar actually lights up!) and the staff is always amazing.I knew the staff was something different about the staff on my first trip 6 years ago when they greeted me by asking for my name - and 6 years later, they haven't forgotten it. Traveling alone can be boring (and stressful) at times, but the personal touch the bar staff adds helps make it feel like I'm on vacation in the middle of a work trip. From Martin, Jason, and Victor behind the bar who are always making everyone laugh and feel welcomed (and make THE best cocktails) to Karim who greets every guest to make sure they're having a pleasant experience.

This is now my 10th visit to this hotel and I wouldn't stay anywhere else.I am not a huge fan of Times Square and the hotel can get very busy (hence outside and in the lobby) it can get quite noisy. I read another recent review where it was mentioned that the cleaning staff are noisy. They might let doors slam but other than that (and mind you not until later morning) I have not encountered noise from the cleaners. I find them to be extremely courteous.What keeps me returning here is the staff from EVERY level of the hotel. I have traveled for years for business in very highly rated rated (5 star) hotels and have NEVER encountered such a team of helpful, courteous, caring hotel staff.I want to mention several people by name as it seems the least one can do... In management, I'd like to mention Agathe (who has gone well beyond the call of duty on multiple occasions), Karim, Allison, Amanda, AJ.At the front desk (I can't possibly mention everyone so here goes) Donald and Imran - who have helped me so much with reservation issues (and everything else) Vera, Sandra, Robert (from the night shift).The restaurant and breakfast food is very good, particularly for a hotel this size. Joanie, Tony, Richie, Jafete, Travis, Filipe have all been absolutely marvelous. Considering the amount of persons they have to deal with daily, I am stunned by their professionalism and kindness.There is a wonderful quick food/coffee counter called the Grab and Go where you can get a quick take away breakfast, lunch, snacks coffee and drinks. There you can find Guillermo and Rahi (amongst others).At the bell desk, they will help you with anything and are happy to do so! Those that come to mind are Michael, Marvin, Abraham and Manuel.The security team is second to none. Traveling on my own, most of the time and sometimes at odd hours, I feel entirely safe here. They know what they are doing and are approachable. As you can imagine, you can have outsiders and some guests who go ""a bit too far"" but the security team treats everyone with respect. Very impressive...those that come to mind right now are : Sokoli, Marlin, Tyrone, Havier, Juan and Spencer.I have had occasion to have contact with Dorca from the cleaning staff and she is very thorough and courteous!Finally, I must mention the doormen downstairs...Joshua (Josh) has been helpful on so many levels. In addition, there is Junior, Sam and Eugene (to mention just a few).I realize that these names will mean little to someone reading a review but I wanted to review some exceptional staff members who have made the difference for me.Everyone needs to choose what they consider important in their choice of hotels. The rooms can be a little worn down in places but they are absolutely fine. The views are magnificent, there is a great gym and pool, loads of fast elevators and folks here will help you with anything. There are all kinds of restaurants right outside the door from take away to lovely quaint sit-downs.I whole heartedly recommend this hotel.",,Catherine M,0,5.0

At the same time, the price of the Crowne Plaza Times Square hotel is easily 2-3 times that of a great hotel in SE Asia.1) The location (right next to times square) was great.2) There was no slippers, toothbrush or toothpaste provided in the rooms. Nor was there any means to boil water - how to make tea then? (this is probably standard for US hotels as I've heard).3) In general the room felt clean but the ceiling was low, which made the room feel smaller than it is.4) The bed was too soft and the mattress was probably due for replacement?5) There were only US sockets and no adapters can be borrowed - although the front desk would gladly sell you one.6) There was an inexplicable per-night service charge in addition to my pre-paid room rates. Considering that not much service was rendered I do wonder how that could be justified. Again, this may be common for US hotels in recent years, as I've heard.7) I stayed for 2 nights so my room was cleaned once during my stay. In Asian hotels, the staff would neatly fold your clothes into a nice pile, tidy up your laundry and cables etc and make the room look good. Here my pile of clothes (which was on my bed when I left the room) was moved ""as-is"" to the sofa. How's that for service?8) There is no central control for lighting in the room - something which I thought was standard for all modern hotels. Each and every light need to be switched on - off individually.I do admit that I've been spoiled by the hotels in SE Asia, where the staff are always smiling, friendly and welcoming, where there is extreme attention to detail to make your room look and feel good, where amenities are provided whether you use it or not. Here, however, the staff wishes to dispatch of you as soon as they can and although I appreciated the efficiency, the hotel did not make me feel welcomed.And then again, there was the service charge on top of the non-cheap room rate, plus taxes.","Hong Kong, China","kawaicheng</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",162,3.0

From the moment you walk in, you are greeted and made to feel welcome and at home. It is very obvious that Mr. Harris leads his management team and staff by example. The staff are always very approachable, professional, and friendly. The team genuinely cares about your stay.   The chef for the breakfast buffet does a great job and offers many items to choose from. The food is delicious, coffee is hot, and the servers are awesome! Everyone has a smile on their face and goes above and beyond to make sure you have everything you need. The Food and Beverage Manager's, Karim, Agathe, and James are always on hand to help. They readily seat, greet and clean tables if needed. They are friendly and always stop by the tables to make sure all is well. The same goes for the lounge. I can’t say enough about the food and beverage team. Jason makes the best drinks in Times Square! Marteen is awesome! Tony is always smiling, Phil, Keith, Kim and Marcus also do an amazing job behind the bar and the food is good!   Isis and Daniel do an awesome job with housekeeping. The rooms are very roomy and always clean. The top of the line beds are so comfy and the pillows are my favorite, I love them! (Thanks to Sylvia's help I was actually able to buy them for my bed at home!) It's very important to not only have a comfortable room, but that you feel safe while there. The security team led by Al, is always on watch by the elevators. Whether I'm traveling with a friend or my husband I always feel safe here.    Every year my husband and I celebrate our wedding anniversary in New York City, this year was our 30th! The staff made us feel very special and our day did not go unnoticed. They even gave us a sweet card that everyone signed! We could not thank Karim enough for the thoughtful amenities we received. From the cheese tray, wine, champagne, and desserts. ( the yummy chocolate covered strawberries!)  He is great at what he does, and it is obvious he enjoys his job.

It is at the heart of Manhattan and therefore you couldn't expect it to be cheap but it probably represents very reasonable value for money given the quality of accommodation and service. We ate breakfast at Juniors (on the opposite side of the street) on all but one day. Breakfast in this hotel is eye-wateringly expensive and nothing special in quality.

It is within walking distance to most attractions (the Rock, Central Park, Times Square, etc). The hotel is nice and clean. The room is quite a good size for NYC. It has a TV.

Trip Advisor only lets me post 10 photos but I could give more than that. The TV was extremely slow in responding to the remote, one bathroom light was out and the shower light was very dim, we had to hold the toilet handle down to make it flush properly, the bathroom vent was bent and filthy, the bathroom counter had an unknown stain on it that looked like rust, a cabinet handle was broken with the cabinet door also loose, no mini fridge available, the desk chair was clearly worn and so was the padding on the headboard. One morning we put the do not disturb sign on the door because we were choosing to sleep in and relax and housekeeping called us to ask what time we wanted our room cleaned. It was a nice gesture and we agreed to 1pm, but I thought the sign meant we were fine for the day?

Yes, the rooms are clean and comfortable (the bed was great!), but there is nothing -- NOTHING -- that warrants the $650+ price tag that the room comes with! I do think that they were price gouging because there was a snowstorm that was threatening to blanket the city and the public transportation system was rumored to be shutting down because of the storm. (The storm turned out to be a big zero, BTW.) The biggest thing that upset me the most about this hotel is VERY THIN WALLS. I could hear the entire conversation of the people in the next room as if they were sitting in my room, talking directly to me. The sound wasn't muffled; it was as clear as day. Thankfully, they knocked off for the night around 11:30 so I was able to sleep, but if they hadn't, my night would have been very disturbed.

They are on the same street.  Other theaters are also relatively close.  This is really amazing, especially in the winter months -  but would be nice anytime of year, especially if the theater is your reason for travelFor a hotel of this size, we never had a wait for the elevators, our room was very spacious and the buffet breakfast was excellent - and with the discount, affordable.  We also had rooms on high floors, which was nice - but honestly, when you are in NYC you are going to be out most of the day - so having a nice view is a bonus if you have time to look out the window.  Everyone at the front desk was friendly, our check in was quick and our room was ready early.As for the neighborhood and restaurants, avoid ""the touristy"" spots in and around Times Square - unless you like that sort of thing.  You'd be better off heading to 8th Avenue or 9th for more variety - or other areas.   We will definitely be back at the Crown Plaza","Miami Beach, Florida","travelguyfromflorida</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami Beach, Florida</strong>",150,5.0

Not at all!!We were there for NYE 2017, and did the Ball Drop package that they have on offer to purchase, which started off at 7.30pm with as much food (Massive choice from the Buffet) and drinks (Cocktails, Wines, Spirits as well as non-alcoholic), you could want, followed with a DJ, and then at 11.30pm, you are encouraged to go outside to watch the ball drop in a private fenced off area in Times Square, not public allowed in there, just people all form your function that night. The view was perfect of the Ball drop. Then it was back into the hotel to party on to the small hours of New Years Day.We had a small problem initially which I will cover later, but the whole experience of the hotel was fantastic. The food quality in the restaurant was outstanding, complete with the friendliest service you will get anywhere from the restaurant manager, who frequently came over to the guests tables to check on everything. I am a bit of a coffee snob, and only drink the Australian/European style coffee, and can’t stomach the filter stuff usually passed off as coffee in the USA, so I was pleasantly surprised that when I asked if they had any real coffee, I was met with ‘would I like a latte or espresso’? And the coffee was fantastic. Admittingly, it was not included in the buffet, but $3.50 extra, which is nothing to pay to have a decent coffee to start the day off with.Housekeeping was also faultless too. This hotel is sooo conveniently located to Times Square, it is so convenient. You walk out, and you have the ticket booth at the top of the square a few hundred feet away at the most, and also the shops etc. of the square at your fingertips. The last time I can to NYC and stay at Times Square, I stayed at the W which was fantastic too, (a totally different styled hotel), but it was nearly 3 times more expensive for the same location! – Hands down, this hotel is the best value for money you will get within Times Square’s precinct. Now, the small problem we had, which was no fault of this hotel, but their reservations center, based miles away in another state.We initially book the hotel room via their reservations centre, which unknown to us at the time, was based in Utah and not at the hotel. So when we saw of the hotel’s website a room titled “Times Square View”, we thought perfect that we book that as we could watch the Ball Drop from our room requested. We confirmed this with the lady at the reservations centre that this is the case.Well, we received an email a week or so later, telling us that this is not the case and that there is no view in the whole hotel that offers the Ball Drop view, just a view of times Square.Obviously we were upset and angry at this, and complained directly to the hotel. Then in steps Varary Henry, an angel. She realises that there was a big miscommunication and that the fault lied with the reservations centre, and offered suggestions and remedies to fix this problem to make our stay enjoyable and unforgettable. That she did. Valary didn’t just stop at making things perfect before we got there, but also whilst there, she gave us a courtesy phone call to make sure our stay was going well too.Brilliant service. Valary should be held in high esteem by management – Staff like this, who are loyal and passionate about the brand and company, are very, very had to find.","Adelaide, Australia","GraemeH187</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",61,5.0

We arrived early in the day, well before rooms would be ready and were able to store our bags so we could hit the city! That was an easy process and the front desk clerk was so friendly and welcoming. When our room was ready, the baggage clerk delivered our bags to our room promptly. If you use this service, I do believe it is customary, or at least courteous, to tip. I was thrilled by our room. We were on the 32nd floor and two walls were covered with windows for an expansive view of the city. It was everything I had hoped for. Our bed was super comfortable and we felt quite at home our entire stay. We did have an issue with our shower not draining properly and had to have someone come twice to fix it. However, the problem was resolved and that made things a lot more pleasant. We were given complimentary breakfast bar passes with Times Square view and it was marvelous. We likely would not have been able to pay so much for breakfast otherwise so it was such a nice treat and we are so grateful for the passes. The little grab and go cafe is great too. We visited it twice during our stay. As far as noise when in our room, we were located near an elevator, but because the King Suites have a little hallway, we heard nothing from the rest of the hotel. The only noise we heard was from Times Square but you can't really escape that even on the 32nd floor. It wasn't bad, though, and we had no trouble sleeping. I have a small fan I like to use to provide white noise so that helped too. When we checked out on our last day in NY, we were able to leave our bags until our evening flight. That made life so easy for us so that we could have nearly another full day of exploring the city.

We booked a Times Square view with breakfast. The room was spacious, comfortable bedding, hot shower... all good. We were on the 28th floor corner room. Buildings in the way, blocking most of the view. A large column in the corner preventing us from seeing out the window and what was worse, preventing the curtains from closing. So don't expect to get much sleep with the lights and sun shining in your eyes.Don't expect slippers, bathrobe, turndown service or the light in the long hallway to work. So you must walk into a dark room with a long L-shaped hallway.The first night we used the (1) drink ticket in the lounge and I asked how late they would be open the next night and what time the kitchen would close. 12 AM and 11:30 PM were the answers. So we planned our day around that. We had lunch around 1 PM and we had a show to go to at 8. We weren't hungry but we knew we would be having drinks and food in the lounge after the show. We arrived at the lounge at 11 PM. We were turned away and told there would be no tables for a half hour. I guess the table with dirty glasses and no patrons and the tables behind the bar with the young children playing and sitting on them don't count. I asked if the kitchen would be open then and was told ""no, sorry"". So we hadn't eaten since 1 PM and went to our room to look for a local restaurant. Everything closes at 12 and we were not going back out in the freezing cold to possibly be turned away and we were certainly not wandering around any strange neighborhoods off Broadway. So we ended up getting room service just in time before they close at midnight. So much for enjoying our last night spending time together before my daughter has to leave.After reading many of the reviews of people being given upgraded rooms on high floors with views after mishaps, multiple drink tickets, use of the fitness club without a fee which we were not offered, water bottles in the room, etc I'm wondering what good it is to be a platinum member.

Bathtub clogged and I was ankle deep in water. Disgusting! The hotel plumber came up and fixed it but the “damage is done”. The tub had an insert, something I’ve never experienced. Felt like the entire tub was moving. Not a nice feeling. The amenities are not high quality. The front desk staff is pleasant. My tax exempt info did not make it to the billing department even though I sent it to the hotel. This happened the last time I stayed here. In the end, this is the last time I will stay here.

The room (4307)was spacious & gave us a great view of Times Sq , not the hotels fault but we had an adjoining door in the room & the neighbours were quite noisy at times. Bar/Lounge service could improve, took 20mins to get my first drink! however Jason on the bar was a great guy & obviously took pride in his job. The reason I did not give 5stars is because a couple of local street sellers came in counting money laid out on a table Playing music on their phones loudly & harassing the female guests. The staff seemed to know them & ignored them when they should’ve thrown them out. I did report this to Amanda the manager on duty and she did monitor it the rest of the evening she assured me since but that was a big negative and made us not sit in the bar again, a complimentary round of drinks on the evening or something left in the room would’ve gone a long way on the last evening (Sunday) as our wives would not go to the bar/lounge again. I work in hotel management & didn’t feel much empathy. All in all though a positive experience ,though I did have to chase the hotel for feedback over the later issue. Would I go back there Yes I would the location and accommodation were great but sorry to say I did prefer the Rui Plaza last year.","Hungerford, United Kingdom","deanl173</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hungerford, United Kingdom</strong>",1,3.0

Originally our rooms were just standard double bed rooms but in the first hotel we transferred to, we got a Time Square view on the 21st and 33rd floor.

I stayed here for one night some years ago on business and loved it, so decided to stay here for a sightseeing trip. The location gets 5 stars for being in the thick of Times Square with a choice of subway lines 5 mins away. However, there is a lot that lets this hotel down. It has not been decorated in years and it shows, tired and dull looking rooms and corridors and a thick black seedy looking curtain over the entrance, I presume a barrier from the cold. Not nice and certainly not becoming of a hotel claiming its stature! The pool was grim, looked dirty and old, the sky light roof was disgusting. On the plus side, the room was a good size and the shower hot and powerful and the bed very comfortable. This was a trip for our 25th wedding anniversary and I did ask for a high floor room to get the best views and also to look down towards Times Square. We did get a high floor but not the view which was a shame. Working in the business myself I was rather disapointed that the hotel didn't leave a small token in our room for our anniversary. Maybe it's an English thing but a fruit plate or chocolate is a typical gesture for special bookings.. There wasn't even a bottle of water! All in all, as we were out from early morning to late evening every day so the quality within the hotel didn't affect us..But to the management of CPTS don't rest on your laurels with a great location for too much longer!..

Although we wasn’t booked for breakfast we would of probably tried it had someone explained.The room was nice and big, we upgraded to a Times Square view. For the price the rooms could at least have a fridge and proper kettle. We had to use the window to keep drinks cold. Bed was comfortable although we did wake up after the first morning with bite marks on our legs. We had the bed linen changed and that never happened again. The tv in the room could have more channels, as a couple travelling myself being pregnant we didn’t want to be out at night time and the tv was absolutely boring so we spent most nights going to bed early.First night we ordered room service as we was knackered from the flight. To say the food was disgusting would be putting it politely. 2 main meals, a pizza and 4 drinks with a pudding totalling nearly $130. And most of it was inedible. Meatballs were rock hard and the pasta was nothing good. Certainly wouldn’t recommend it, we didn’t eat at the hotel after that for this reason. The man behind the counter of Grind and co is so rude. So we even stopped buying stuff from there. Hubby asked him if he had a good day and he just ignored him. We even found the men at the baggage hold down stairs rude. On the day of check out we had a bill pushed under our door for two separate bills we apparently had. One of them was room service which we had, the other was for sitting in the bar having dinner which we didn’t do, so make sure they bill you for what you actually had. We had to speak to front desk about it who removed it but she looked at us as if we was lying. I don’t mind paying for something we’ve had. We tired to get a late check out as our flight was a late one, the latest they could give us was 1pm with no extra charge so I suppose that was ok. When actually checking out the women didn’t even look at us, just gave me a bill for the room service we’d ordered and that was it. No thanks for staying with us. Hope you had a nice time, have a safe flight home. Seems no one in the states has manners as we’ve came across no one here with them. Apart from the room cleaners maybe. For the price we paid I at least expected some manners. On the whole I wouldn’t return and wouldn’t recommend staying here to anyone.","Greater Manchester, United Kingdom","Danielle R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greater Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",18,3.0

It was our first time to New York and the staff are very friendly and helpful from check in to check out. There is also an information desk if you want to book tickets for a show or need some guidance. There is an ATM in the reception area but it didn’t accept our debit card from the UK, it did accept our MasterCard though. The hotel bar is average priced for a hotel bar and did some very nice cocktails. I got given vouchers for 2 free cocktails as I was celebrating my birthday whilst there. The table service in the bar was a little slow but there was a lot of people to serve so bear it in mind to be patient. Some great views of Times Square from here. The Location was the main reason for us to book this hotel as it was walking distance to the main attractions. From the Flatiron Building to the Empire State, Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Plaza all just a few blocks away. There are plenty of great places to eat too. I would recommend Ray’s pizza for a grab it n go slice, just around the opposite block, up from M&M world and also the Majestic Diner on the corner of the same block. You can get a large can (1 & 1/4 pints) of beer (coors light) here for just over $5 and the breakfast was delicious. We booked our New York Passes before we went and picked them up next door to M&M world and I would highly recommend this. They gave us access to most attractions and also a queue jump at the top of the rock which was really beneficial. It also included the hop on hop off bus tours with 3 different loops, uptown for Central Park area, midtown for all the central attractions I mentioned before if you aren’t a walker, and downtown for the financial district and Statue of Liberty. The main pick up was just outside of M&M world too so very handy. The theatres on Broadway are all within walking distance whatever you choose to see. We saw the Lion King and it was absolutely amazing. The hotel rooms are very spacious, we had a room with 2 double beds (so so comfy and plenty of pillows) there were loads of power points around the room and a radio alarm/Bluetooth speaker too. There was also a large flatscreen TV with pay per view movies available. There was central heating/air conditioning. A cupboard for hanging clothes also had an ironing board and iron, there was a safety deposit box in another cupboard and a small fridge. Tea and coffee making facilities were also provided inside one of the cupboards. There is also a hairdryer in the bathroom. Small bottles of shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and moisturiser are provided too along with hand soap and a shower cap. There were plenty of towels available in the rooms which were changed regularly too. I think the room was maybe a little tired and could do with a freshen up in places but it’s not something that bothered me. It certainly wouldn’t put me off staying here again or recommending to anyone. Thank you Crowne Plaza, we hope to visit you again.

I'm a business traveler that travels to New York City several times a year. The hotel is located on Broadway between 48th and 49th Streets, which is perfect for me because I can walk to all of the offices I need to visit. It is located on the edge of Times Square which puts you close to all the excitement of the area without making it difficult to walk out the front door of the hotel. I've also found there's less road noise at this location than other hotels that I've stayed in that are just a couple of blocks away in the middle of Times Square.The rooms are large for New York City standards and they're always fresh and clean. There's plenty of counter top space in the bathrooms and the showers always have plenty of hot water and great water pressure. I've never had trouble with a clogged shower drain at this hotel either. From Robert at the front desk to check-out, and everything in between I've always found the staff to be professional, efficient, and friendly. I almost always eat breakfast in the restaurant and it's always such a pleasant experience. Travis and all the guys are quick to refill your drinks and will even send me off for a day of work with a bottle of cold water for my walk. In the evenings it's hard to beat the bar for a place to socialize, catch the game of the day, or just unwind. Jason, Marty, Kim, and Phil are all pro's at keeping up with the pace and still find time to joke and laugh with you. Karim is usually close by checking on guests and saying hello. I've become friends with guests from all over the world at this bar. The atmosphere makes it so easy to meet people and chat when you're feeling social but it's also pretty easy to find a spot to sit quietly with a glass of wine if that's important to you. From a safety and security standpoint, the security personnel are very visible and are diligent about checking room keys in the evenings before anyone is permitted to head up the escalator to the main floor or the elevators to the guest rooms. I like this hotel and the staff so much that I'm planning to bring my family here for our next family trip!","Kansas City, Missouri","albaybel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kansas City, Missouri</strong>",4,5.0

Anyway, we were placed on the 18th floor overlooking Times Square, something i had prepaid for. We proceeded to make our way to the lifts which incurred a further 10 minute delay. Due to the hotel having so many floors they operate lifts specific to those floors so you have only maybe two lifts that you can get in. With a hotel that size and so many people staying there we waited a lot for lifts throughout the course of the week. Out of interest i timed it on our second to last day and it took 13 mins for a lift (that wasn't already full) to become available. This was more of an inconvenience then anything else. Prior to booking we were encouraged to stay at this hotel due the security and the fact hotel key cards were checked to ensure no one could access the hotel. We were in and out of the hotel daily and our cards were ironically only checked on the very last night we came back. Other than that we were never asked to show cards at either any entrance/exit or before we entered a lift. The room itself was a great size with plenty of storage. In general the room was a little run down. The headboards were ripped and peeling, the bathroom seals had come loose and there were chips out of the bath. My youngest dropped something behind a unit and it was clear that cleaning only happens in areas which you can see. There was plenty of lighting and we couldn't hear the noise from Times Square with the window closed. Different story if the window is open and it's likely you will need the window open as the room was very hot. I called the front desk and requested a fan which was used every night for the rest of the week. The blackout curtains are also great in blocking the bright lights of Times Square. The beds were comfortable and there were plenty of plug sockets. We always had plenty of hot water and the tv was a good size. We rarely used the tv but there was an option to rent films. A little tip for the room key cards, dont put them near your phone, ipods or some other cards. I had to go and get mine reactivated because of this which isn't a quick fix when you wait 10 minutes for the lift and then queue again at reception. We didn't use the restaurant or the bar at all so cannot comment. There are so many places in and around NY that we just chose to venture out. We did use the little shop on the lower level to take a few snacks to the room. We were also able to jump in a yellow cab outside of the hotel very quickly. The hotel will offer their car service but it is much more expensive. The yellow cabs have fixed pricing for the airport runs. I would also point out that we were made fully aware by the third party that additional costs were included so this wasn't a surprise. We didn't use the pool or the gym as there wasnt time but the wi-fi signal was very good. You do have to keep reconnecting though. There didnt seem to be a limit to the number of devices you could connect either which was great. The concierge desk was brilliant with helping us out, a special shout out to Joanne Miceli @ City Experts who was so efficient. Our other experience with the employees wasn't so great. The check in desk just seemed so miserable each time we spoke with them, not sure why. The location of the hotel is perfect, cannot fault it. Surrounded by loads of shops, restaurants and within walking distant to most points of interest. There are also a number of subway stations near the hotel which was so useful as we used the trains all week. Overall it didnt impact our week much because NY has so much to offer. I would however look around for another hotel next time as i have spoken to a lot of people that stayed in similar hotels at a more cost effective rate. If however this hotel still looked to be a good deal then i would stay again. Lastly, i am having to contact the hotel as they have charged my card approx £55 and i have no idea why. If you have booked here dont be put off, it wasn't terrible by any means, there are just a lot of improvements i would expect for the price paid.

Sandra Esp was really informative in giving us advice and explaining how the tax's worked etc, and what the best approach was to securing a room for that night being that we had not walked into their reception until 4pm that afternoon. We secured a booking for that night for the rest of our trip and it just made out trip that extra special.

Booked through our travel agent and was told everything was included including resort fee (which gives access to pool, gym and WiFi. Also a voucher for a welcome drink would be included)We arrived earlier than expected and the woman on the check in desk found us a room that was ready. Checked in and everything was fine. (At this point we forgot we didn’t get a drink on arrival due to us travelling from the UK and we just wanted to rest)Room was amazing. Great views. Big and spacious room and no complaints whatsoever about the cleanliness of the room. However, from that point, we found the staff in the hotel to be very rude and very unapproachable. We usually stay in Crowne Plaza hotels and we also have a membership for when we do visit. We find that the attention to detail and customer service is great wherever we stay. On this occasion, very disappointing. I approached a lady on reception to advise we had not received our welcome drinks. This was because we have to pay $39 a day for us to get a welcome drink and use the pool and gym. I challenged why we didn’t receive this and the lady said that we had no right to this offer and we had to pay extra for this. I tried speaking to the manager but was told they were not available so. Instead I was shouted at by the lady and a man approached and also started getting angry with me. At that point I decided not to even interact with the staff at the hotel. From looking at recent reviews , people have had this issue before. It seems as that if you receive a “special gift” or a “gesture of goodwill” like cake or a special message, these things are overturned. As previous. This whole trip was only marred by the sheer unprofessional staff who did not want to listen to me or take on board what I was trying to say. Also. I would advise if anyone wishes to get a car or taxi through concierge, it’s easier to book yourself and save a few dollars instead of tipping for someone else to do it for you. Views from the room were exceptional. The comfortable bed was also amazing as we did a lot of walking throughout our trip. The price of the breakfast was quite expensive each day so we decided to go to Juniors on a couple of occasions as this was far cheaper than over $30 a day.

I have stayed in Midtown near Chelsea, Lower east Side, Queens and the Upper West Side. I loved all of my locations because we are a family of 3 and we walk everywhere plus hop on and hop off the subways. We are like the locals, we know our way around and we just love NYC, it is so inspirational. We travelled to NYC Jan 27-30th 2018, to celebrate my husbands 50th Birthday. I chose the Crown Plaza due to its location right in Time Square and we didn't have to go far to do anything. The hotel is beautifully decorated, and always clean. The maids were always at our door waiting to clean our room when we left. We didn't spend much time in the hotel but when you check in you do get 2 vouchers for a free drink up to $15.00, at the restaurant/bar. When I checked in , I had given the lady my name and reservation number, and proceeded to give her my visa card to pay for the resort fee. It declined twice and I said that's ok we will just use my husbands visa. The lady remarked to my husband that "" That maybe your girlfriend doesn't have any money in her account"", my husband said first of all she is my wife and we share the same bank account. We were both mortified with her words, but it didn't seem to matter to her for being ignorant. I know not all people are like this, so I let it alone and proceeded to go to our hotel room. The rooms were clean and the beds were very comfortable. it was nice to have a coffee maker in the room but I wish there were small fridges so we could buy milk or cream for our tea/coffee. We bought a little bottle of milk and placed it in the window to keep cold but went sour. And the other thing was once the day came for us to check out , a knock came to the door around 7am, to pass us our bill for the resort fee, which had been paid when we checked in and the balance was 0. So when my husband checked out at the front desk, they charged us again for the resort fee. I would suggest the agent at the desk please follow up with notes on the confirmation number so things like this would not happen. We had to get to the airport and my husband was at the front desk for over half an hour when it should have only taken 5 minutes. Other than that, I would definitely stay there again, but without the comments or remarks from the agents at the desk and I will make sure there is a follow up with notes on my reservation.","Elmsdale, Canada","jarett94</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Elmsdale, Canada</strong>",4,4.0

The location of the hotel really is perfect as you have everything basically on your doorstep - theatres, excellent restaurants and 50th ST subway station to take you downtown. Your a 10 minute walk to the Rockefeller Plaza and about 20 minutes walk to the Empire State building.Our first room had a nice view over the city to the Hudson river. A handle on the window was loose so one side wouldn't close tightly causing a draught with it being on the 26th floor, I guess the work would be too much while we were there so they offered to move us to a room with a view over Times Square, and kindly settled our bar bill also. On our last day our safe developed a fault and would not open, so after a quick call to reception again a lovely chap named Ruben from the hotel security came to reprogram the safe and get our passports and cash out for us. He was an absolute gentleman and kindly gave us vouchers for a buffet breakfast and arranged for a late checkout for us. Because we were normally up and away early we would get breakfast where we were going that morning, we would not have tried the hotel breakfast. I think it is $35 for all you can eat continental, cooked and a good selection of cakes. This was my first time in NY and I absolutely loved it!

The location is the best feature. It is smack in the middle of the theatre district and easy walking distance to many shows, stores and restaurants. The price I paid through Priceline was low for a NYC room so I was okay with the fact that the room was shabby. The bathtub literally had a layer of paint peeling off the bottom. The bathroom needs to be redone. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable and the room is not as small as a typical NYC room. There seemed to be a lot of amenities, such as restaurant, bar and gym, I tried to use the business center but the printer was out of ink for 2 days, although the manager did print for me when I had a need. The blow dryer didn't work and they replaced it. Don't seem like a big deal, but between tipping for the people who helped me print - which was deserved and person who brought me a new dryer, also deserved, it was money I shouldn't have had to spend.

Crowne Plaza part of IHG group, you would expect minimum standards and service levels to be met by such a reputable chain...Not so at this Hotel. Checked in given our first room of which was tired run down and filthy. Complained, demanded a manager of which it took almost an hour for one to come, she looked at room and agreed it was unacceptable. She went away... more waiting. New set of keys sent up but not by a Manager as you would expect with such a serious issue, you would expect a manager after such a serious complaint to personally come with you to your new room to ensure it was up to standard and your guests are happy, not at this 4 star Crowne Plaza. Made our way to the new room, on our way the lift dropped a floor and shuddered between the 25/26 Floor... we were petrified. We got out of the lift shaking went to the new room to calm reception. The room cards wouldn’t work to the new room. Tried to call for help on the phone by the lifts and waited over ten minutes in a queuing system!!!. Exposed bed what happened absolutely no care in the world. A new set of keys sent up by yes you’ve guessed anyone other than a Manager ... A security officer after another long wait. What a complete joke!. Got to new room, awful room was tired and scruffy. Tried to get a Manager and more difficulty, the customer service at reception had to message management who finally spoke to us after a further long wait. Was told no other rooms and pretty much told had no choice but to stay and we would be moved the next day. Yes we were moved the next day to a much more satisfactory room, however we were only on a 3 night break and it took almost 3 hours after check in to get to a clean room after all the waiting around and trying to speak to Management. The general attitude of staff at this hotel throughout the remainder of our stay was dreadful. Another poor example of customer service was one of the many occasions room cards stopped working. There was a huge q at reception, went to the gold priority area where there was a female member of staff who told me to go join the q rather than simply rectify the issue. At breakfast you would think they would explain the procedure rather than just sit you at a table... it was a buffet but the buffet was completely out of sight so you couldn’t work out where it is unless you ate told!. On check out there was no question about did we enjoy our trip, cab we assist you in any travel arrangements to the airport etc, just simply leave the keys there!This hotel is an embarrassment to the IHG group, do not go expecting a decent 4 star hotel with good service just because it’s got Crowne Plaza over the door.

In my room the wallpaper was peeling off in places, the headboards on the beds were scuffed and the finish coming off, the towel rack in the bathroom is falling out of the wall, etc. The common spaces seemed reasonably maintained but my room was not in the best shape. The location is convenient if you want the insane Times Square experience, but it's not quiet -- as many Manhattan hotels are not. Please note this: if you need transportation to an airport, do NOT take what the bellmen try to push as the ""hotel car."" I did not use it because it was about 30-50% more expensive than a taxi, but the taxi driver I had told me that these are not really ""hotel cars."" They are black cars driven by independent drivers who work out a kickback deal with the bellmen who get money for every time they put a guest into the ""hotel car"" for a trip to the airport. Apparently this happens at a lot of NYC hotels, so be cautious. These ""hotel cars"" also want cash and claim not to have credit card capability. That is so they can keep the cash and not report it on taxes. Take a taxi or Uber.","Kansas City, MO","KaneoheBoy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kansas City, MO</strong>",194,3.0

We’ve stayed here before and, liking the proximity to theaters, we chose it again. We are Spire Ambassadors. We do expect a standard of care with that status. We were disappointed with the lack of attention and care. Upon arrival, there was no one available to help with our luggage. We unloaded our bags, pulled them inside, and the proceeded up the elevator. Other reviewers note the lack of early check in. We experienced this as well. While they held our bags for us, they didn’t text when the room was available, as they promised. So, the whole arrival and check-in process was fumbled. Our room was nice and comfortable. There are no complaints about that. Unfortunately, this Crowne doesn’t offer bathrobes in the rooms, a small luxury that is noticeably missed. Our biggest complaint is the climate control. Other reviewers noted this problem as well. THE ROOMS WERE TOO HOT! The solution - open the window - is hardly reassuring, and because the windows only crack open, it took over 24 hours for our room to cool. So we spent our first night in relative discomfort. The bar area is nice with a fine selection. Service was a bit slow, but we attribute that to either being under-staffed or unexpectedly busy. All in all, it was an average stay. Management should take note of these issues and work to correct them as quickly as possible.

We were lucky to have breakfast included which was a delicious array of american andn continental cuisine with something for everyone. We really enjoyed the choice of pancakes, french toast or waffles changing daily with maple syrup and bacon! My partner enjoyed his smoked salmon and cream cheese bagels too. Breakfast was filling so we usually filled up on that for most of the day! Check in was efficient, and we managed to check in at 2pm rather than the 3pm it states. Our room overlooked the School of Rock Theatre and Ellens Stardust Diner. Breakfast room overlooked M&M world, and the hotel bar overlooked other parts of times square. We were give tokens for a welcome drink which was a lovely touch too. Although we didnt use it the hotel does have a sports club and swimming pool which is included in your additional rates you pay at the end of the holiday. Overall, i would recommend this hotel again especially if it is on offer, as its location is unbeatable!Tip: As its america remember that the room rate you pay is not the final total you need to add daily service charges and tax too which you will pay at the end!

Its very accessible to get ro tarin station or siteseeing bus or walk through the city centre and no needing to take any taxi to go around unless needful. We arrived at lunchtime but were not busy in check-in and were very quick and smooth however there is no smile or welcome which you always expect or get when you go to any hotels. Im a part of IHG Rewards club points but i was never asked and i had to mention that and then she put my membership number on system. The check-in lady explained that we get free wifi and phone calls were included in our room rate. However not told anything about breakfast and is location, rates and times. Also hotel facilities were not explained e.g. pool and gym access which i didnt know they had one until checkout. The basic introduction was missing about the hotel. Guess had to figure it out myself. The rooms were very spacious and we had 2 double beds with a time square view which was amazing as per how be booked. The bathroom was nice with bath tub and good hot water. Housekeeping was prompt and very well. Breakfast option was continental and American. We went for full American breakfast which costed us $35 after tax per person. There was good selection of hot foods but no bake beans or omelette but usual bacon, sausages, scrambled egg, pouched egg, coldMeats, various selections of cheese and soup and salads. The boulevard bar is lovely which is located in the hotel lobby and has good selection of cocktails with a lovely view of timeSquare area. Remember in usa every prices shown are before tax hence you have to calculate final amount to get accurate value.The hotel is easily accessible from airport as we took a shared bus shuttle from outsideJfk arrival to penn station (about $20) and walk to hotel about 15mins walk or you can catch any yellow cab from penn station to hotel (less than $10) or jfk to hotel (more expensive >$65 plus tip) the journey about 45mins from airport to penn station. The hotel vicinity has good selection of restaurants around offering variety of cuisines. On our last day we had options of taxis to get to airport e.g. a yellow cab, an airport prebooked shuttles online, or hotel suv cabs which you can get from reception at entrance of hotel. It worked out $8 diff between yellow can and suv private cab hence we took suv private cab which was ready on time with our name board early morning 4am as we were couple it worked out reasonable for us $42 pp. checkout however was quick but on receiving the checkout bill i was charged for accommodation and my hotel was already prepaid. Luckily I noticed so please check bills carefully. On my booking i was mention inhave to pay $30 per night service fee but then on receiving invoice i saw that i had to pay for tax on service fee plus city tax hence it was about $5 so total is $35 per day extra on top of your hotel booking payment. It was then I understood what services fee was for and that included pool use, gym use and telephone calls, WIFI. However this was never explained on check in and my hotel room pre-paid rate had free wifi included and regarding pool and gym was never told hence never accessed it but i felt i paid for something i didn’t use which was mandatory as service fee. At checkout there were no apologies for the incorrect charge but also “no smile or thank you for staying with crowne plaza” which i always hear when i stayed in other crowne plaza hotels and IHG partners over the world. I also heard when going that the checkout person was discussing that i was complaining about service fee and service and city taxes and accommodation incorrect charges with another colleague.

Great location, super convenient to all that the Theater District/Times Square has to offer. The majority of theaters will be a 5-10 minute walk. Even the south end of Central Park and Columbus Square can be reached in 15-20 minutes walking. Same with Rockefeller Center and MoMA. Loved that part of it.About the hotel itself. The room was a bit more spacious than other hotels we've stayed in for not that much more. The room was clean, smelled good, and there were no glaring signs of wear and tear. The bed was super comfy. One of my favorite hotel beds ever. And pillows that didn't mush down to nothing. That's a big deal for me. Always hot water for a shower. Everything in good working order. Very pleasant experiences with front desk, housekeeping, and bell services.There is a grab and go section with reasonably priced items just off the lobby near the elevators. The lounge also had some well priced food and beverage choices. I didn't look into the more fine dining restaurant. Also didn't try the fitness center. Believe there was a $10 charge to use. Had a room toward the end of the hall and never heard the elevator or inside noises. You are right off Times Square and will hear some sirens and such from time to time. Still, got good sleep. That's the trade-off for being so close, right?Several good restaurants within walking distance (Carmine's, Juniors and loads more). A Starbucks a block and a half down Broadway.

The location of this hotel was amazingThe attentiveness of the staff wasn’t so impressive - on arrival we mentioned it was a birthday visit. Most hotels I’ve been to normally would have done something just small to notice this to show that they are interested. The hotel didn’t even acknowledge this (which to me made me feel not very impressed) Paid for a Times Square view, we were on a very low room with not such a great view. We asked after checking in if we could have a room on a higher floor as it was noisy and the reviews say the higher the room the less noise, also I’d imagine the views would be a lot better the higher up. We were told they’d let us know the next day if there was any more availability on a higher floor, we heard nothing more from the hotel so just left it. Feel it was a lot of money for this hotel and didn’t feel the staff made it feel worth it. However I would recommend this hotel for the location and also the room was nice. Just try and get a higher room if you are paying extra for the Times Square view. They took money from our card without letting us know and we have tried getting in contact with the hotel since as we would like this money back and we have heard nothing back after trying to contact them numerous times - this is highly disappointing and not what you would expect from this type of hotel.

I went downstairs to reception and asked for a change of room. When asked what was the problem and I explained to them that the stanstard of the room was not acceptable they said they were refurbishing the rooms and the room that we had been allocated had not been refurbished so I asked to be transferred to one that had, the receptionist said the hotel was very busy but she would try.

I went back to the room and we waited for help to arrive but after 20mins when no-one turned up we moved ourselves.We were absolutely exhausted.the room that we moved to was alright. The coffee maker was a bit of a joke,you could only get 1cup at a time which seemed to take for ever.You are allocated 2 pods of coffee and 2 pods of tea per day.I couldn't believe the cups were plastic wrapped in plastic and the sugar ,stirrer, and serviette wait for it were also wrapped in plastic in a seperate packageI would have thought in a Hotel which cost £220 per night we might at least have got proper cups and saucers.One bonus was that we were on the 400 floor which gave us fantastic views and the beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in.We didn't eat in the hotel as we were on a mission to see as much of New York as we could. I can't say i would particularly recommend anywhere in particular as we found the food wasn't up to UK standards except for the RIU hotel I beleive it's on 6th Ave. we found the breakfast there to be very nice and lots of choice and at a reasonable price. we had booked a 3 day trip with 5 attractions included from the Big Bus Co,and initally we thought it was expensive I can assure you it was the best thing we did Fantastic well worth the money as if you paid for rach attraction indvidually it works out very very expensive. New York is an extremely expensive city but absolutley brilliant loved every single moment of it.We also booked whislt we were there to see ashow at Radio City It was a Christmas Special it was amazing.

First, the room is fine, I like the Shower , the water temperature & water pressure is really good, especially during winter like this time, showering with a mild warm shower & strong water pressure is cool thing to do before going to bed. I don't like the housekeeping going in and out of our bedroom when we were still sleeping. I do understand that they want to know if we want the room cleaned or if we are okay. But once you know the guests are still in bed sleeping, I think you should wait til we say ""go ahead!"". It was just uncomfortable we were still in the middle of sleep while the housekeeper enters our room screaming if we want to get our room cleaned. Atleast, coordinate with your frontdesk that would prevent inconvenience to the guest. The bedcovers were not cleaned everyday,incomplete toiletries, no complimentary toothbrush,toothpaste, & some cotton buds. No complimentary waters when they know we have a kid who still drink milk. Another, when you request something it takes almost half or an hour before they arrive or you also have to keep calling their phone and no one will answer. I don't think all the staff are friendly except the Frontdesk lady who checked us in, she was friendly and nice to us , we checked in late at night. No microwave, no fridge & their coffee maker is not updated yet to keurig. The rooms are not updated, its old but its fine. Their heater don't work well i guess, it was already on 80 for the whole night but the room never get warm, my whole family are still cold & comforters doesn't help, we usually use the fluffy brown blankets that actually keep you warm but seems like they do not have it, I am so surprised that Crowne Plaza didn't meet my expectations. You don't feel welcomed as an IHG Platinum elite member, actually both me & my wife were elite members, you are not recognized, not greeted, the service they have doesn't show any recognition for elite or all club members. We were glad to stay here because it's obviously around the tourist areas. But I would hope the management improve their member recognition, services, and faster service. We went downstairs to get some dessert around 11pm. The restaurant was serving in room service as well, they have the menu in the room, which is supposed to be available after midnight. We went there and ordered and the server told us that the restaurant is closed but we can order in room. My wife and I with our toddler just left, went to the back got some soft-drink and snack (nobody informed us that there are vending machine somewhere,we found it ourselves. Anyways, so we were like, it doesn't make any sense, like we are here in-front of the server, why would he tell us to go back to our room and order? So far,the expectations wasn't met, service is poor & the only thing we like is the hotel location. Lastly, their lamps look broken I dont know why they're slanted. On our third day, the key suddenly didnt work, we were freezing trying to-get into our room and our keys was deactivated. We were told to go down to get new keys, although someone opened the door for us.To the Manager-please Feel free to contact me if you like to talk about the issue. Thank you!",,zsohlt,1,3.0

We stayed on the 45th floor (there are 46 in total), and for us it was a good floor to be on as you are high enough up to cut out the noise from the city below. Room was facing the Hudson River and the 2 best things about the room were the very comfy bed and the excellent shower. The rooms probably could do with a few dollars spending on them as they are looking a bit tired but we had a great nights sleep each night and that was the most important thing after walking around the city all day. We did eat in the bar a couple of times, the food wasn't great but the fact you could come back to the hotel and get away from the mass of crowds in Times Square was a great relief! The best and worst thing about the hotel is the location..right next to Times Square, near the 49th and 50th subway stations, easily accessible.....however the front of the hotel is on the path of all the CD scammers, ticket scammers and unfortunately lots of homeless people. The homeless people are a sad sight and you cant help but feel that there is a lot of homeless people in New York, however the scammers, particularly the CD scammers are intimidating, they are they to rip you off and get your money...and if you say no they are very rude and call you out for being racist..etc.. We ended up giving $30 dollars to 2 different men just to get away from them....unfortunately they 'patrol' right outside the front of the hotel...so be warned.

He didn't leave our side until we were safely in a taxi and on our way. It was a very busy time of day, and we really appreciated his help since maneuvering around the city can be tough. Last night, after a long afternoon in the ER with my daughter who fell while ice skating, we found ourselves dinner-less at 6:15 pm with 7 pm tickets to Wicked. We called room service to order a quick bite. I explained our time crunch and the room service employee expedited the order, and it arrived in 15 minutes. We ate and were out the door to make it on time to the show. We were so appreciative of their fast service and for recognizing our needs. While we were leaving the hotel to go sightseeing, one of the cleaning staff asked if it would be OK to clean our room while we were out since we had our do not disturb sign hanging on our door. We responded that cleaning wasn't necessary and that we were fine. She offered to provide clean towels, make the bed, and/or empty the trash. We were totally fine...and were impressed with her commitment to make sure that we were taken care of. The check in went smoothly and the employee at the front desk was friendly and helpful. I wish we had taken her advice to grab a quick lunch at the Green Apple Deli rather than having chosen to eat at Juniors. However, I went to the GA deli for breakfast this morning and it was great! Quick service, good food, and reasonably priced.

But our experience last week was so bad as to deserve a full report/venting. At check-in we were told they only had rooms with two doubles available; all their king-sized bed rooms had been given away. When I pointed out that my reservation said my bed choice (king size) was guaranteed, they said it wasn't guaranteed by them (the guarantee appeared on the Hotwire confirmation--Hotwire will be hearing from me as well), even though I had paid my $1300 or so three months earlier in reliance on the promise of a king-sized bed. After a lengthy discussion, we had no choice but to accept the room we specifically didn't want. Our initial room featured a window that didn't fully close, allowing very cold air (it was in the twenties outside) to blow in, along with the noise from Time Square. After a trip to the front desk, we were given a room with a functioning window. But that room was overheated and could be cooled only with the window open and a fan they supplied. They eventually came to shut down the overactive heating system; heat from the adjacent rooms kept us reasonably warm thereafter.. And we were treated multiple times each night with a howling sound from the hot water fixture in our room. Initially, they treated my complaints with skepticism but I was eventually able to call the front desk during one of the lengthier howls and, having heard the offending noise over the phone, they assured me someone would fix it the next morning. Great. The problem was reduced, but not eliminated the final two nights of our stay.The hotel is undeserving of a four-star rating (I'd give it maybe a three, provided they fix the plumbing and windows).

BIG MISTAKE. The trip was a disaster because it turns out you cannot control the temperature in your room, and the room was too warm for us to get a good night's sleep. And if you can't sleep, everything else is a struggle during the day. That shouldn't happen on a vacation, and certainly not at a hotel that charges these rates. If I did not have a ""non-refundable"" rate, I would have changed hotels. We could not get the temperature in our room below 71-72 degrees at night. I need to have a room between 66 and 68 degrees when I sleep because my particular CPAP machine's nasal mask will not seal above those temperatures when my body heat is added to that of the room. I called down to the desk the first night about 3-4AM and asked to be moved to a room that is cooler at night. The clerk said she would leave a note to change me in the morning, and that we should turn off the heat and open the window to let in the cool air. We did, but that didn't help - the temperature was still 73 degrees in our room. We did not get moved. I asked three times, and it was only on our 5th sleepless night that someone FINALLY listened to us and changed us to a room the next day that was on a lower floor on the other side of the hotel and had a larger window that opened and actually let a cool breeze in. So for 5 nights out of 7 I was not able to sleep. If you need a cool room to sleep in, find a newer hotel that has FOUR pipes (two for A/C and two for heat). This hotel, we discovered, only has TWO, so they can only have EITHER heat OR A/C, and apparently you cannot effectively control (reduce) the amount of heat you get. They did bring in something they called a ""portable A/C"" unit, which had a small vent to suck in outside air, but it cycled off when it got down to 71 degrees and then the room heated back up to 73 degrees. I brought a portable room thermometer with me because having my CPAP mask seal properly is such a critical issue for me (see the pictures).","San Francisco, California","SanFrancisc0Seeker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",3,1.0

The rooms are smaller than some other local hotels I've stayed at, and the room could afford some renovating. Unfortunately the worst parts though we're 1) Occasionally when the air turns on, the whole room begins to smell like cigarette smoke. Without the air on, the room smelled fine but it's hit or miss. Despite the hotel claiming the facility is smoke free, either some guests or staff are smoking somewhere because the stench is real. Just as I turned off the light for bed, the air came on and made the room pretty unbearable. 2) I went to take a shower during my two night stay, and the nob and cover literally just came off the wall, exposing the rather ugly cylinder behind it. I didn't really expect the cylinder to look clean, but it definitely looked like it had been around for awhile. Given how easy it came off, I suspect a lazy maintenance job on it instead of a replacement. While I normally enjoy my stays at the Crowne, this experience was rough and I'll probably move back to the Marriott for my next NYC trip.

I paid extra for what was supposed to be a larger family room with two large double beds. Upon check to my shock discovered the beds to be a couple of inches bigger then the single beds we have in the UK, I have never experienced this before in any hotel in New York always had large beds in the room. The beds were way too small for two people to share! The head board had a plastic type coating that was all peeling. There was a really bad damp smell in room and the bedding felt damp. After all of us had a shower I discovered cause. The extractor fan did not work in bathroom so after we all had our showers the windows were dripping with water, window ledges became wet with condensation, bedding once again damp. For a family room the room had one half size wardrobe with 6 hangers and there were 3 drawers to store clothing! No fridge/mini bar available. On our 3rd night there they were able to change us to a different room with one king size bed and a roll away bed that was not as damp, had a lot of dust though to which we took pictures but by this point I had given up on complaining as on our second night there we ordered room service I was the only one to order pizza and after eating 2 slices I thought something didn’t taste right so I didn’t finish it. Around 4am I woke feeling extremely sick and began vomiting non stop and had severe stomach cramps. I phoned guest services and they sent security to take an incident report and they took away the remaining pizza and I was told it would be tested and that the manager would contact me, I received no contact at all! I was ill for over 48 hours! I wanted to settle my account the night before departure as was leaving very early and I saw I had still been charged in full for the meal which had made me sick and I asked for an update on my food poisoning complaint and was told that the restaurant manager was not available, the manager working at the time Michelle said she would take $50 off of my bill but when bill was posted through my door later nothing had been deducted. I have not bothered to contact the hotel to argue this as it was never about the money. I got food poisoning from the hotel kitchen ruined over two days of our holiday and not once did the manager have the decency to contact me. This hotel in no way offers value for service and their guest service is appalling. Only positive with regards to the hotel is it’s location. I will never stay in this hotel again on my return to New York and would never recommend it to anyone in no way does this hotel deserve its 4 star rating it’s a very poor 1 star in my opinion!

The rooms we found there we indeed spacious enough, but were (as the entire hotel) pretty run down (paint in the shower splintering off, furniture falling apart etc). I would say it dates from the 1990ies (if not 80ies) and it shows. The other big draw back: you feel ripped off: a 30 USD service per day per room (Q: „Madam, what is it for?“ A: „Internet, Sports Club etc.“, Q „And if I don‘t need this?“ A „You have to pay it anyway“) I found it in the small print of my Expedia reservation, but it did not show during price comparison. 420 USD plus tax for unspecified services regardless if wanted or not, I find this not ok. Another example: using the so-called business center for printout of tickets: first 5 minutes and 2 pages free (I barely made it), but guess what: you are being remembered and the second time they charged me 7.50 USD for 2 pages of print. That‘s what I call a margin. In Europe, Crown Plaza hotels is a relatively up-market chain and they would never get away with an offering like this.

The room was actually quite large for a Manhattan hotel. We later traveled around New England and on our return to New York we stayed at another name brand hotel a few blocks uptown because I wanted to be closer to the Park and Rockefeller Center. That room was so small we could barely walk in the door. I was sad that we didn't come back to the Crowne Plaza. I also liked that the window opened a couple inches to let some air in the room. It was unusually warm for October and the air conditioning was turned off as most hotels do in New York in Fall and Winter (I have no idea why). Just that little bit of air made all the difference and kept the room from being too stuffy. I was also worried that it would be too noisy being so close to Times Square but that wasn't the case at all, at least no different than any other hotel I've stayed at in New York.Everyone from check in to the help in the Lobby Bar were pleasant. Not exceptional but I have no complaints.

Times Square was just a couple of blocks the other direction and also just minutes away. The room was clean and nicely decorated but had a little wear and tear on it. The headboards of the bed were scuffed up, the wallpaper in the bathroom bubbled up in some places and our bathroom faucet dripped. The beds were super comfortable and the pillows a fluffy delight.The room was very average in size nothing huge nor was it super cramped. Just your average double bed hotel room. Room service did a nice job each morning making the bead and refreshing the bathroom.The gym had a lot of equipment to offer and my daughter utilized the facility to keep up with her cross country training while we were out of town.

We enjoyed our stay here and would come back for the excellent location. I didn’t use the bell service, room service or anything else.

I went there for a work trip and typically they book events at high end hotels and I realize it's NYC and it's expensive but I expected a little more. The lobby is in need of an upgrade. It's older, but not charming old. Everything seemed clean though. The room itself was fine- nothing exciting. It was a smaller room (typical for NYC standards) and they only had rooms with 2 doubles (no queens) and kings (we brought our children so we had to make do with the 2 doubles). The beds were ok- not amazing. We did have a room on the 46th floor and we had a magnificent view of Times Square. The area is right smack in the middle of Times Square. There are LOADS of restaurants, theaters, and stores all walking distance. If you're going for that experience it's a great area to be in!The service was not that great. No one was very friendly...the bellhop was rude. We gave him our ticket (we had the hotel keep our luggage while we explored the city after checking out) and he brought back our cart and just left it for us to deal with. No one helped us with the cart or our luggage as we loaded into a cab. I was so suprised! And it wasn't like there were tons of people waiting for their luggage- there wasn't anyone there! The front desk could work on being more friendly. I've been to NYC many times and it's not like it's a NY thing to be unfriendly at hotels. We did have an amazing server in the bar/restaurant right in the lobby. I forgot her name, but she was warm, friendly and a complete gem. She was wonderful with our boys and was super attentive and she should train the rest of the staff at the hotel! I went there for a business trip so I spent a considerable amount of time in the meeting rooms and again- there is room for improvement. The podium was so hideous- knicks and scratches all over the wood and the bottom of it had duct tape on a part of it. I was actually really surprised they would still use it. During the meeting the hotel was doing some construction which was super distracting. If I planned the meeting I would have been upset.Bottom line- if you get a great deal and aren't planning on staying in the room too long then go for it...otherwise...keep looking. There are a ton of amazing hotels that I would consider before this one. Also- this isn't a 'luxury' hotel by my standards- but it was expensive, perhaps not $600 a night, but it was pricey.","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","Joinourvidaloca</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>",59,3.0

Location on Time Square is the hotel's main attraction. Our room located on floor 26 (2 double beds) was spacious although the room itself could do with an update i.e. carpets and furniture drastically need upgrading. The room itself is dark (even with 3 lamps on). The bathroom door wouldn't shut fully cause the door doesn't fit the doorframe. The taps/faucets were leaking after use and the standalone mirror was rusty. Overall it didn't bother us too much but faults like this are noticeable from a first impression of the accommodation. Room was cleaned daily and tea/coffee facilities were welcome. Receptionist was very helpful when I called seeking assistance. Restaurant is only open for breakfast and lunch. ""What no evening meals to enjoy the ambience to Time Square???"". Sorry no you have to avail of bar menu. ""Ahh FFS we might as well ramble out to a restaurant or bring back food to our room"". Every time we exited the hotel we were ambushed by bus sales reps - not the fault of the hotel but it affects your mindset regarding location of the hotel.

Way more interesting things to see as your hoofing it. This hotel is about a mile to the park so we walked there anyway but I feel like I couldn't have taken in Times Square in two hours or toddled down for one day/night to see a show and been good. Wouldn't recommend setting up shop here. The hotel was okay but staff didn't really care about our stay and didn't seem knowledgeable about hotel grounds and amenities. We called to asked about early check in and was told about 1p would be okay. We got there at 2p and was told otherwise. No early check ins possible and told to come back at 3p. Called down to see if we could bring a drink to the pool. Transferred three times because no one knew the answer. We gave up waiting. We had a loud horn type noise that would go off periodically from the vent in our bathroom. It was so loud we assumed a fire alarm was going off. This thing went off several times early AM our first morning. We were exhausted and figured it was a fluke so we kept ignoring and going back to sleep after it shut off. When we returned to our hotel mid evening it continued. The front desk took no action on call 1. Called again an hour later and was told someone would be right up. Nope. We left for the evening and ran into security on the way and played a video of the noise. He laughed and said engineering would have to come up - we would need to wait. Or we could just try calling again when we returned. What a hassle. Never resolved the noise issue for us. Also I left some keys in the room and no one seems interested in helping us locate them. Called several times and was being told to just try back later. No offer to check with housekeeping or help a guest stressed out about items left behind. Still waiting but I think I'm just better off to head to the dealership and get a new car key.

I felt staff were very helpful. Unfortunately my second time around that wasnt the case.When I was returning to New York my obvious choice was to stay at the Crowne Plaza. I convinced my group of 8 that it was the best choice as I honestly felt at the time that it was.Upon arriving the reception staff were very good. Really helpful and gave us tons of information. However, the bar staff were very rude. The service was also very slow! I felt the bar was very under staffed and our waiter that was with us was busy with another table and when I asked one of the staff members that was passing our table for a drink I was told your waiter is over there, he will get it for you when hes ready. I work in hospitality myself and in our hotel the number 1 rule that we have is everyone helps eachother so I was surprised to hear her say this! (Also, i know the hotel doesnt have anything to do with this but the public were very uphelpful and rude also.)On the day when we were leaving we all had our bags down stairs and were asking the gentlemen if it was possible to get a taxi where he replied a simple 'no'. I asked why and he said all 8 of you wont fit in a taxi. My reply was I understand that, so we are fine to get 2 or even 3 because of baggage. His reply was ok and just walked away. So rude!! honestly never felt as stupid in my life as I did when I was just standing there. So i returned to my group and told them that we just had to deal with it ourselves and as 8 ladies were dragging 12 big cases out through the revolving doors the 2 men just looked at us. I get that sometimes a big group like ours is annoying when we have questions etc but honestly a little bit of kindness would have been appericated. It just put a dampner on our holiday and every single one of us agreed that we would never return to New York and were delighted we were heading to Boston (where we find the people to be so much nicer!) Reception staff were brilliant in this hotel and so were the concierge staff. Maybe New York is a one hit wonder because I enjoyed my first time 2 years ago alot more then this time around.","Galway, Ireland","Amy O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Galway, Ireland</strong>",8,2.0

The hotel is in the center of Time Square and is a fantastic location for tourists. The whole experience was completely amazing. The delightful receptionist was so helpful and gave us a map indicating where we were and the locations we asked her for. She recommended local diners to us and provided information on purchasing Broadway Show tickets and reduced prices. Then the fun begun.... to squeeze everything in there is a LOT of walking involved but we managed to do all we wanted and more. The tour tickets sellers are everywhere and can be rather annoying but the trips are amazing and worthwhile. We had already purchased 3 trips and needed to activate our card, after some confusion we obtained the ticket and needed to get the ticket seller to activate it... unfortunately he failed to tell us he had activated the ""hop on hop off"" all day bus ticket and gave me (what i thought) was a receipt so we lost one excursion. We did report this and the manager was brilliant offering another ticket without any problems. Just be aware if you have a pass for more than one excursion ensure they understand exactly what you want. Juniors diner is opposite the hotel and the food is totally amazing.. mum was hooked on their cheesecakes! Be aware of the portion sizes though please they are massive!!!

This hotel is in an AMAZING location for tourists, unfortunately not so great for those who are from the area.LOCATION: The CP is right in the heart of Times Square, near where Broadway and 7th Avenue intersect. The hotel does have an entrance from 48th and 49th street as well (good to know if you want to skip entering through the crowds). The hotel looks very nice, has many floors, with amazing views of the city.CHECK-IN: Check-in for me was easy. Being an IHG platinum member, I paid with points and was able to check-in at the IHG member area, however even the regular check-in would have been quick. Check-in was incredibly quick, and I was in my room within 5 minutes (yes, 5 minutes).ROOM: The lobby to the CP is on the 2nd floor, and elevators are right around the corner. The elevator was quick, and my room was really nice, with an extremely comfortable bed, nice walk-in shower, and very clean. I saw some wear, but overall the room looked great.SLEEP: The bed was really comfortable and the shades draw tight to block out all light. The A/C wasn't amazing for me like other hotels, but it was still absolutely adequate and I slept comfortably. Also, very quiet hotel, at least on my floor.OVERALL: As mentioned, for tourists, this is a great hotel, in a perfect location. For anyone doing a stay-cation, it's right in the heart of Times Square, so be prepared for an annoying walk there. Or take 8th and cut down 48th or 49th - there is a walk-through garage for the hotel with an entrance.","Ramsey, New Jersey","mstrctrlprgm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ramsey, New Jersey</strong>",116,4.0

Neither my husband nor I had been to New York before and were a little apprehensive about what to expect. The hotel is very easy to access by cab (take a yellow cab from the airport for a fixed fee for ease) and by Subway, and Grand Central Terminal is only 5-10 mins walk away. Once we arrived at the hotel, check in was smooth and easy, the reception staff were friendly and helpful, and we were given a room on the 44th floor (4406). The higher floors are better for those who don't like the hustle and bustle, as although it's never totally quiet in the city, it's easy to switch off and sleep being so far up from street level. The room itself was a reasonable size, there was plenty of room for my husband and I to get around without falling over each other or our luggage. The bed was vast and very comfortable, the large window allowed us to get a full view of the Hudson (rooms on the other side of the corridor look directly over Times Square - great for views but you'd need to use the blackout curtain that is in the room!). The room had all the amenities you would expect - large flatscreen TV with a good choice of channels, coffee machine, hairdryer, iron, air conditioning (the fan was slightly noisy on the higher settings, but nothing that stops you sleeping after a busy day of sightseeing and shopping, and given that the temperature was in the high 20's / low 30's during our visit, we were very thankful that we had air con!). A nice touch was the USB charging point next to the bed, so that you don't need to use an adaptor to charge your tablet or phone. The room (and the hotel in general) was very clean and tidy, and the maids were in every day to top up the toiletries and give the bathroom and the room a general clean and tidy-up. All the staff we came into contact with were helpful, friendly and polite.We didn't make much use of the dining facilities in the hotel as we wanted to try as many local places as possible, but there is a bistro / restaurant that serves breakfast as well as lunch and dinner, and there is a coffee shop on the lobby level that sells cakes, pastries, boxed salads etc for you to take away. There is a bar area opposite reception also - we did have a cocktail here, but the choice on the menu was limited so you'd have to ask the barman to make you most things from scratch, and be prepared to pay for the privilege (we paid over $30 for two cocktails). The location of the hotel can't be faulted - it is right on the edge of Times Square, on Broadway, and centrally located for East / West / Uptown / Downtown visits. With 5-10 mins walking you can get to Grand Central Terminal, the Rockefeller Centre, Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Macy's, the Hudson Piers for the main boat tours and Water Taxi, and many other attractions. Our check out experience was straightforward and stress free, and the hotel offers luggage storage for guests on their check-out day so you don't have to cart your baggage round the city waiting for your transfer. This is quite handy, given how busy the streets around Times Square are, it's good to know that you can wander the city to get in some last minute sightseeing whilst your luggage is safely stored away. All in all, we had a very enjoyable stay at the Crowne Plaza - it served as an excellent base to explore the city, and gave us a comfortable place to retreat when it was time to unwind and escape the city buzz.

It was understandable after all sometimes there are problems happened in the management system.But when we opened the door of the room they gave us. We found there was someone living in that room!!! We had to go back the front desk AGAIN to let manager double check the correct room number. We felt so scared what if we are the customer in that room but others still are able to come in directly?? That is not the only upset thing happened during livings this hotel. The double size bed—I was told that two people could sleep through the BOOKING.COM—is very narrow. It seems that the width is 1.2kmand not to be enough for 2 people to sleep ( Thanks God we are slim.

First and foremost I would like to congratulate the front desk woman Evelyn for being the nicest, kindest, most compassionate person and understanding our situation. Once checking into the hotel, we found our Room had a number of problems with it and she did everything she could to correct them during her shift. The most evident problem was the drapes had been ripped down from the East facing windows which meant the Sun would be coming blasting in at 6:00 a.m. and we asked her to attempt to correct it. She immediately sent engineering up, who proceeded to basically nail the curtains to the window so they could never be opened again. After that we found 2 lamps did not function and one which was broken and would fall over every time you even passed it. In addition,The only electrical outlet in the bathroom was not functioning and the shower would not drain till well after a shower was done. We were told we could not be moved because the hotel was at capacity due to fashion week and the evacuees from the storm but were promised things would be fixed. Nothing was fixed for the remainder of our 5 days there .Upon returning home and dealing with the mess we have here. I took the time to write to the hotel and explain that this was not acceptable for a $400 night hotel Room. The only response I received was a brief note from the hotel manager saying thank you, glad you enjoyed your stay.

No sign for valet parking. No bell man to indicate where to go. Had to negotiate an escalator with my bag and cane to get to the lobby. The front desk is only accessible by going around a huge pillar blocking the view of it from where the escalator drops you off. They did not have the kind of room I reserved (king bed). They added a $30 service fee for wifi, gym, and two free alcoholic beverages in their lobby bar. The room thermostat was set at 78F and took haolf an hour to cool the room. The bell man when I went to get a cab was helping an able-bodied young man get one. The guest actually hailed it, but the bell man insisted on placing his luggage in the boot to justify a tip. Then, the bell man walked off into the hotel and into a closed door without assisting me. I waited five minutes then went to the lobby to complain. The manager tried to make it sound like it was my fault for not calling out to the bell man when he was dashing to the door. Another bell man went down with me and took almost five minutes to get a cab. I was almost late for my meeting despite giving myself 35 minutes to get a cab for a 15 minute ride. When I returned I saw the manager again and let him know I wasn't happy he tried to blame me for my issues getting a cab. he agreed to delete the service charge. Next morning, I went to take a shower. No shampoo. The bar of soap kept falling through the metal wire of the soap dish. The water surged on for cold in the shower and mysteriously turned off when moved to hot. After a few tries, I gave up and went to wash my face. The faucet dripped out water when the handle was turned a quarter-turn and then immediately went to gushing and splashing beyond that. I went to check out and the person told me I should have called down for shampoo and to get the water right in the shower. This was 5 a.m. and I needed to get going. He persisted in telling me they would have fixed the problems if I had just notified them and I explained again that I didn't have time to wait for things to be fixed that should not have ever been an issue. Then I saw I was charged $73 for valet parking, more than double what I am charged at my usual hotel 15 blocks away.","East Greenbush, New York, United States","Ruff B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>East Greenbush, New York, United States</strong>",14,1.0

Karim, the food and beverage manager was extremely lovely and spoke to us on many occasions throughout our stay... he answered all our questions about where was best to go in the city. One thing especially was that when we were sitting at breakfast or at the bar, Karim came over and asked us about our day and really made effort which made my friend and I feel very welcomed and special.

I was concerned about security as it seemed that the elevators were not operated by room cards and were accessible to non-residents. Considering how open the lobby areas are to anybody coming in off Times Square I would have hoped for much better security to the residents' floors (as I have experienced in almost any other comparable hotel).

The windows are almost paper thin. When securely locked I can still hear the wind outside and the traffic. I sleep with earplugs anyway so it doesnt affect me but others may struggle.

It is right in the middle of Times Square which means you are well located for the Empire State Building, Top of the Rock, 5th Avenue and Central Park. It is an extremely busy hotel and outside on Times Square/Broadway it is congested with tourists and there is a lot of noise. Our room was on the 32nd floor so with the double glazing it was fairly quiet although you could always hear the sirens from the emergency services vehicles. The room we had was a King Size room overlooking Times Square. The bed and pillows were really comfortable and the shower was large. A bath would have been nice after long days walking New York's streets. We booked room only and only ate breakfast once in the hotel. This was complimentary following a major problem with our in-room safe which refused to open and needed to be drilled open and replaced. The security staff and engineers who dealt with this were really good and persisted until it was sorted. I don't think the breakfast is worth the money as there are lots of places to eat breakfast outside the hotel. Check in was quick as I am an IHG member. We had to check out by 11am on the last day but our luggage was safely stored until we left. The only criticism I have is that we wanted to get changed before we left for the airport and you have to get a room key to access the toilets. By UK standards the hotel was expensive but being in Times Square this is the price you have to pay. There are a lot of taxes added to your bill so be mindful of this - this isn't just hotels but in shops and other places. As an IHG member you do not pay the resort tax but if you aren't a member you will be charged this on top of your room rate.

Although we had by that time made alternative arrangements for our visit.The team lead by Avi Yesawich at CPTS proved to be just that ""a team"". They made myself and family very welcome during our stay in New York. Once they knew our family had reason to celebrate our visit to NYC, they organised complimentary cake and wine on the very first night of our stay, celebrating our children's 18th & 21st birthdays and our 23rd wedding anniversary. It's worth paying the little extra to request a family room facing onto Times Square, The team organised that we had a room on the 37th floor (3701 on a corner), with great views over the city. It took 3 days for my wife to notice that she could see the Empire State building from her bed. Times Square is busy, busy, busy and the gentle buzz of activity can be heard 24/7, so if your head can stand it, go high. New York is a living working metropolis, so don't be surprised to hear traffic and construction working taking place...

Tip 20% for good service, you're going to get it!What can I say about NYC? To enjoy NYC you're going to walk and walk a lot. Take a good pair of trainers and quality socks, your feet will thank you each and every night. Every family has someone who plans the holiday, let them do it. They'll love doing it and you'll get the benefit of having your days filled where you don't waste a minute. we did 8 days and could have quite easily done another five or six and not repeat a visit.Drinking any form of alcohol in NYC is 21 and up, so go with it. Don't embarrass yourself or your server by asking (they could lose their job). To be honest the beer is not great anywhere you go. It's lifeless and flat with five minutes of hitting the glass.

It is in need of of some updating in the rooms. Check in wasn't to long and staff was friendly. Even though we asked for a room with a view of Times Square they didn't have any available..Our view was of the roof tops and a little glimpse of the cruise boats. Our room was clean and did the job of a place to lay our head after a long day & night out and about. I would compare it to a reg. Holiday Inn Express room. Downstairs there is a bar/restaurant with great views for people watching but no outdoor sitting. We only had beers so can't report on food. The breakfast they offer seems a bit over priced for what is served but we got the $10 discount tickets per person so in that case it was worth it. We did notice the tip for the waiter was already included where I'd rather be charged for the food and then let me leave a tip based on service. Our waiter basically explained how it worked and that was it except to bring us the check.He never checked on us. Probably because he knew he got a tip automatically. Food was good and they had a great selection. We will probably take a cheaper hotel off the strip next time to get more hotel for our money. ,"Fayetteville, North Carolina","bw3taz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fayetteville, North Carolina</strong>",54,4.0

When we informed the hotel check in assistant of this she completely lacked empathy and was more interested in continuing her conversation with her co-worker. Considering that this is the first point of contact with the hotel, she didn't make a good impression-we got the impression that we were actually inconveniencing her. (Maybe this is not representative of all the front desk assistants-perhaps we were just unlucky.)I asked if she could provide essentials (toothbrushes and toothpaste) to which she replied ""There are toiletries in the room."" I asked if we could have extra shampoo, conditioner and body wash as we were a family of four, so we could shower before we went out to purchase basics, but an hour after we arrived at the room, this hadn't arrived so I had to call the front desk to request them again. When our cases arrived a few days later, no-one called us to say they were at the hotel. It was only by chance that I called to be told that they were there. I don't know how long they had actually been there!Efficiency:As soon as requests were made by telephone, (for toiletries, luggage, room service) the items arrived at the room promptly with staff being extremely helpful and courteous. The room:We had a Times Square view with two queen beds. Room was average size. Cleanliness generally was fine but, as another person has previously posted, the cleaning staff seem to have an aversion to dusting. The radio alarm was covered in dust, along with the surface of the table it was placed on and the lamp bases. Beds were ok-if you don't mind a firm mattress. Pillows were amazing-I wished I could have brought one home!Bathroom was average-there was a big chip out of the bath but the shower was good. Position:Excellent location which was why we selected this hotel. We walked to Grand Central, Public Library, Rockefeller and 5th Ave. Hotel bar:There seemed to be only two staff serving in the bar area. The lady who served us seemed quite stressed with number of people she was trying to serve which led to brusque responses for food orders and for the bill.

And to be fair the front desk clerk, I think her name was Rohda, went somewhere to try to find me other rooms. And then I was promised to move the next day.

However, we had a great view of Broadway from the 38th floor.The hotel location is superb - we could see the subway station from the room so great for getting around. The concern was that there was no security on the doors - anyone could walk in off the street. You did not have to pass through reception to get to the elevators and you did not need a key card to access the elevators. This did seem strange.We did not use the dining facilities- $32 for breakfast x6 was more like a charge for dinner in other places and there were more than enough places to eat close by. There is a coffee shop and we did use this once for breakfast - but service was so slow we only used it the once.We used the hotel as a base - basically to sleep - as we were out and about for 14 hours per day!

The hotel is in a brilliant location, which is why we booked it, and the staff were extremely helpful. However, the hotel is definitely a little tired and in need of a refurb. We arrived on Sunday, late afternoon, and were promptly checked in by a very nice man, who asked if we would like a room with a view. I was thrilled at that. Unfortunately, we were evidently a bit naïve as we thought he meant a view of Times Square. We should have thought to ask! What we got was a bit of a view of the Hudson river, between neighbouring buildings. Our room was large but the wooden furniture had definitely seen better days. The large, flat screen TV (very nice) was on top of a unit that housed the coffee/tea maker (pods supplied), a safe, and some drawers which didn’t shut properly and looked like they may break at any minute (not so nice). The bed was large and extremely comfortable, with bedside cabinets whose drawers didn’t shut properly either. The air conditioning wasn’t great, which meant we found the room quite stuffy, and was very noisy too. The bathroom was large and bit like a wet room. The shower did have a curtain, and a ‘lip’ to it, presumably to prevent water from going in to the main part of the bathroom, but we needed to put towels down to mop the water up every time we showered. However, the shower was extremely good and much better than our one at home! There were toiletries, and a hair dryer, but no dressing gowns or slippers. The plumbing did need seeing to as every time we turned the cold tap on it made a noise similar to a ship's horn when it leaves port. Perhaps a nod to our view of the Hudson?After the first night, we had a conversation about whether we should move rooms, as I was quite unhappy. However, after looking at the photo gallery on the hotel website, we realised that we probably wouldn’t get a better room. We ended up having quite a comfortable stay, and decided our room was simply quirky. Would we stay here again if we came back to NYC? Probably. Would we recommend it – yes, we would. We would just advise you not to be too disappointed by the hotel’s frayed edges. It’s obviously well used, and judging by the reviews on TripAdvisor, well loved.",,Ril0804,19,4.0

The only not-so-positive comment that I have is that there is only one waitress taking orders She's courteous but it's just too much of an area for one person. Our order did take time to arrive. The best thing about the hotel is its location--right smack in the middle of Times Square activity. You can jump on a subway only a block away. We didn't have problems with check-out and weren't surprised by additional prices. The room itself is modern, clean, and well-stocked. There is no microwave but the hotel will provide a small fridge for baby bottles, etc. One particular thing: the lobby is attractive but there are only four chairs for guest to rest on. My guess is that they want guest to patronize the bar/restaurant. Food prices around Tims Square are steep so you have to shop around for delis, where you can buy food by the pound. Often we bought our food in delis and ate at the provided tables. Would I stay there again? Yes, but again it hurts to pay $350 a night. But, having checked NYC hotel prices for December, You can not beat the safety and location of this hotel.",Forth Worth,"NelsonSarah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Forth Worth</strong>",19,5.0

They went the extra mile to fulfill our requests and all the while remained incredibly dedicated to making us feel welcomed, which we very much appreciated as it was our first stay in NYC. We planned this trip for over 6 months trying to decide which hotel to stay. Upon seeing other hotels around the city, my family and I have reflected that this must truly be one of the best, not only for its convenient location in the heart of all the action of New York, but also for its excellent service and hospitality; the next time we visit, we'll be sure to stay here once again. In all honesty, one of the highlights of everyday was always being able to come back to our comfortable hotel room after a tiring day of exploration. The comfy bed and most specially the fluffy pillows just hit that aching spot. The hotel itself, aside from located in the heart of time square, just a block from subway station, theaters, restaurants, shopping, not to forget the weekend market on Broadway. The hotel lobby is great, always clean and not too crowded. We would like to thank housekeeping too for keeping our room clean daily. The front desk staff, with such great smile and customer service. Until then, we definitely would recommend this hotel to anyone who's looking to enjoy all the city has to offer under the care of people who go above and beyond to ensure that our stay is as amazing as possible. P.S. Evelyn, you're the best!.... when I was in line to check in, as I observed everyone in the front. I was hoping I'll end up with you. I wasn't disappointed. You excel in what you do!

There we were met by a guest receptionist named Vera WOW !!!! this girl was so nice and friendly and welcoming she answered all of our questions, was very polite and accommodating . She should give training to other hotels we have stayed at on guest services as she is fanstastic. She gave us 2 complimentary drink tickets which everyone seems to get on arrival, which not to many hotels that we have travelled to in North America or Europe do so that was nice. She then came back with complimentary breakfast for us ""thank you Vera"". from Canada!! We got to our room and it was a good size and clean, the bed was comfortable and we had no issues with cleanliness or service. The view was average but again if your in New York your not living in your room, and your also not paying $$$$$ your there to be comfortable and enjoy the City , if you want to over look Times Square then pay as you would any where else otherwise enjoy the hotel. . We had no issue with Wifi and as to the lobby washrooms they were clean and yes a key card opens them, geez your in New York do you want anyone using the lobby washrooms let's be reasonable it was forthe guests as well as safety. As to to the cafe we enjoyed the coffee and muffins but again your in NewYork an it's basically the same price everywhere else within the tourist area. This Hotel is great location friendly staff both at front counter , restaurant, and conscierge. The only thing I would recommend would be a doorman at the door on broadway to help persons with luggage etc as they do at the breezeway as we noted several people getting out in this area as we did but trying to manipulate the crowds etc with young kids is very hard. Yes we would not hesitate to return or recommend, excellent service and clean facility .Doormen were helpful and polite as were all staff we encountered great customer service !!! Very enjoyable stay!!!! And yes enjoy your drinks over looking Broadway Ave with friendly bar service . Also maybe the hotel should have a list of which company's are allowed access to drop off an pickup in the breezeway for future customers we travelled Go Airlink so not sure if they are allowed on property as we had to walk out of breeze way to get to our ride, so maybe a list of shuttles accepted by hotel on their website would assist future customers.

Conference facilities are excellent. I was pleasantly surprised by my room, I had a corner room with a spectacular south and west view. If you are a tourist and you really want to feel like you're in the heart of it all, this hotel is for you. I was also very pleasantly surprised by the room - everything seemed new, bed was comfortable, bathroom was modern and updated, it was much more than I expected. It was also totally quiet. I felt like I was in a little Manhattan penthouse, very chic which was not what I would expect in midtown. The drawback: you're smack dab in the middle of Times Square. Which I avoid at all costs. It is crowded and noisy (no New Yorker ever ventures on purpose to Times Square). So to get away from it you have to immediately head west (my tip, walk over over one or two blocks west and then head north, you'll be to Central Park and start of UWS - much more civilized and quiet). But the plus is, if you are a tourist, you're right in the heart of Times Square! So it just depends on what you want, like, if you have kids, this is probably a great choice. It gives you a real ""New York"" experience. Also keep in mind the elevators are crowded with tourists too. That's the vibe till you get to your room. So I stayed in my room, went to meetings and then got the heck out of Times Square when I needed to get some fresh air.

When traveling to New York on business I have a wide choice in hotels. Midtown Manhattan does not hurt for choices, so usually I tend to chose hotels due to brand loyalty, value and location convenience. As far as IHG chain is concerned, I've been an elite member for years, frequenting their brands around the world London, Hong Kong, New York, etc. unfortunately Crowne Plaza New York Times Square will not be getting my return business again. Main reason.....room cleanliness! For a hotel that boasts itself to be ""newly renovated"". I found the rooms rather wanting....to say the least. Upon my check in, I asked for a room in a ""quiet zone"" (a Crowne Plaza trademark).....yet the IHG front desk representative had no clue what I was talking about.....NONE. He offered a non-connecting room at the high floor (whatever..) Before I was even able to enter my room the housekeeper ran over as I was trying to open the door and informed me that the room was clean, but needed maintenance to change the shower curtain. I said it was fine, and indeed that was changed in the next 10-15 minutes as I was unpacking. However, almost immediately I noticed the room was not very ""clean"". However, being tired after the flight and being late Sunday evening I just went to sleep. Next morning I made sure the room was ready for service and even left a tip on the bed (hoping it would make the difference). The photos below was taken after I returned to my room after work on that second day.......First, let's talk about ""newly renovated""......DVD alarm clocks went away in like what 2010? At the latest? Does anyone still travel with their CD collection? For an upscale brand like Crowne Plaza to not have Bluetooth alarm clocks with USB charging ports in 2017 is rather embarrassing. That little tidbit aside let's take a good look at those headboards.....both bed headboards are horribly scratched.....It's unsightly.....However, THE most Disturbing / Disgusting part is the actual cleanliness. Look at that layer of dust!!!! That nightstand, alarm clock, power outlets have not been wiped in weeks...weeks!!! Just look at that dust pile! Seriously. Are that green m&m candy and that plastic cover to some kind of box???? Neither were mine....they are laying in plain sight under the desk. Any amount of vacuuming (either before I got the Room Or the fist day of my housekeeping service) should have picked this up..... I left the do not disturb sign on my door for the remainder of the trip as I didn't want anyone messing around with my toiletries. I slept in my t-shirt as I didn't have a high degree of confidence in the cleanliness of my bedding...If I wasn't working long hours and coming back to the room to sleep, I would have found the time to complain, I guess I'll just vote with my wallet and let my corporate travel agent know about this experience.I did call during my first morning about the sink that wouldn't drain (see photo) and that was fixed......","Hong Kong, China","HKBuckeye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",19,2.0

I knew going into the trip that Time Square is more of a day trip rather than an entire trip, but wanted the lights and excitement of it all the be imbedded in my son's memories. We got a time square room with double beds. The room itself was average and nothing above and beyond, the view from the room is what really made be book the Crowne Plaza and that in itself was worth it. We didn't do breakfast at the hotel because of the price, in my mind no hotel should charge a $30 daily hotel fee and $30 per person breakfast fee for food that is your typical hotel fare. There are plenty of restaurants off of time square that are reasonably priced and the food is miles above what you would get at the hotel. If you are thinking of staying in Time Square be aware of I the hagglers and big bus tour workers who congregate outside of the hotel doors. At other hotels in Manhattan you don't have this problem which honestly at the end of the trip you'll wish you can walk outside and not be bombarded by throngs of people trying to put things in your arms and trying to guilt you into giving money to ""feed the homeless"". I love New York City and everything it has to offer but for me personally even though the hotel was nice I feel like there are other hotels that are higher rated and a more comfortable stay that cost less, don't have nightly hotel fees and don't come with the masses of people right outside your door every day that are more worth the money. The trick with New York is you need to branch out, every area is easily accessible by walking, subway or ferry so don't do yourself a disservice and by only staying in one area or only checking out the sites; embrace the city, meet some New York's and ask their advice on where to eat and what to do- no one gives better guidance and knows where to find great affordable food and things to do than someone who lives there. You might also find an area that you want to spend more time in since each burrow has its own charm and features. Also remember in the hustle and bustle of the city for you it is a vacation, take your time and enjoy yourself don't get caught up in the crowd.

I had never been to New York and she had only been once, about 20 years ago.After much research, I settled on the Crowne Plaza as our hotel. I am fussy in terms of bed size and won't book anything without at least Queen size beds. On arrival, check in was very quick. The Crowne Plaza does charge an additional $30US per night service fee (not sure if this is a ""tourism tax"" sort of charge), but I knew from reading other reviews that, as an International Hotel Group (IHG) member, I could get an exemption from that. Membership with IHG is free and you can apply online. I asked for a room higher up, to create some distance from the street noise, and we were given room 2715, on the 27th floor. This was a corner room with a King bed and it had windows facing east, onto Broadway, and north, onto 49th St. We didn't have a direct view to Times Square itself, as it is a couple blocks south on Broadway, but we had a terrific view, none the less. Just a couple blocks east, we could see 30 Rock.Our hotel room was spacious, especially for New York, clean and reasonably modern. Toiletries provided were better than average and we had a nice, large, standup shower. Our room did have an adjoining door to the next unit and, unfortunately, we had some VERY discourteous people in the next room who, after coming back to their room around 0300hrs, decided to start fooling with the door from their side, locking and unlocking their deadbolt, waking us. They were quite loud the second evening as well, arriving at their room around 0100hrs and waking us again with their loud conversation on the phone. Thankfully the noise the second night was shorter lived than the first. So bear in mind the walls and doors may be a little thin from a noise point of view.We did not use the fitness facilities or pool....in fact, we weren't sure where they were until we were leaving and the elevator door opened on the 15th floor. We saw the sign for the athletic club there....too late for us to take advantage of. All in all, we were so busy seeing the sights, we likely would not have found time to, anyways. We enjoyed a couple drinks at the hotel bar, all very good...nice lounge overlooking 49th and Broadway.The hotel is located in an excellent spot for seeing much of the sights and definitely close to most of the Broadway theaters. We had tickets for School of Rock at the Winter Garden, which is almost directly across the street. Rockefeller Plaza is only a couple of blocks away, as is Times Square. On our second day there, we walked up to Central Park, north through the park to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It's a walk of a little over 3 kilometers, but we picked up a coffee on the way and sat for a while, enjoying the atmosphere of the park. For reference, after walking around the Met for a few hours, we took a cab from there south to Rockefeller Plaza and, with a decent tip, the fare was about $20. Over all, I found that everything seemed closer than I had expected...the city blocks are small, so to walk 10 blocks will probably only take you 10-15 minutes. We went to the 9/11 Museum which is a long distance south. We decided to brave the Subway which ended up being really quick and easy. From the Crowne Plaza, we caught the ""E"" train south at 50th St and 8th Ave, only a block away. Several other MTA lines are also close by. The fares were $2.75 each which you load onto a $1 metro card. It took us right to the WTC which is probably within walking distance of Battery Park and several of the ferry docks on the south end of Manhattan.If you have never been to New York, particularly the Times Square area, you will probably be a little overwhelmed, as I was, with the crowds, lights, and noise. The first night, especially, we noticed it, even in our hotel room. By our third night, we were growing a little bit used to it, but it may keep you awake, so earplugs might be worth bringing.We were very pleased with our stay I look forward to exploring more of what New York has to offer next time!","Borden, Canada","AllanC476</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Borden, Canada</strong>",9,5.0

Housekeeping was wonderful taking care of providing extra towels and requests made, the front desk, operators and basically just about everyone. (P.S Please remember to tip Housekeeping.

As is the adage with real estate it is location, location, location. But that only gets you so far. I recently had the opportunty to share a trip to NYC with a number of close friends. For many, this was their first visit to the big apple. Based on location and ammenities, we selected the Crowne Plaza - Time Square. The hotel is ideally located in Mid-Town Manhattan, and with a little effort in using the Subway system, you can get to anywhere in the city. With the extra efforts of the staff my friends not only enjoyed a great trip, but a travel experience. It started right at check-in. We were greeted by a friendly and knowledgable front desk attendant, Imran, who was able to assist in navigating thru a number of reservations and did not miss a beat. He constantly commented that it was his goal to make sure our stay was the best he could possibly make it. Checking into the rooms, we all experienced great views of Time Square.

We were very happy with the hotel itself, the staff and the concierge were extremely helpful and friendly in every way. We were always happy to get back into a familiar place at the end of a very long day. This hotel is in such an excellent location, central to a whole lot of tourist attractions, that we ended up walking pretty much everywhere we went with the exception of Harlem, where we took the Hop on Hop off bus. Our room was on the 35 floor, with incredible views and was relatively quiet. We actually found coming home that we missed the honking and sirens at night!! The room itself was very spacious, which surprised us, as we were told not to expect a large room in NYC. This was very large, with a lovely king size bed which was extremely comfortable and with pillows that were exceptionally good. I do not do well sleeping in a different place and it usually takes me a day or two to get used to somewhere new, but I did not have one bit of trouble falling asleep here. The room could have used a few improvements, (sad and cracked headboard and the black out curtains were not easy to maneuver) but that is really quite nitpicky at best. If I had one suggestion, we would have really liked a mini fridge in our room as when we were there, it was very hot and we would have enjoyed cold water when we got up. I am way to cheap to pay $30 a day for a fridge so that is on me more than the hotel!! The one thing that I do have to question is that we purchased tickets from the concierge for Come From Away, which by the way, everyone should see. It is amazing and made us very proud to be Canadian. Anyway, when we did receive the tickets from the concierge, we found that the ticket price on the actual ticket was $89 per ticket. I just looked at our credit card statement and we have been charged $589.00, which is quite a difference in price and I know that our Canadian dollar is not that bad... so if I could suggest anything, it is maybe get your tickets at the actual Theatre and not from the concierge, who really are quite lovely, and I don't think this is their fault, but I am not sure how much of a mark up there is and we didn't check, so unfortunately we will have to deal with the price as it is on our credit card. I would have been much angrier if the play sucked, but it was excellent so it isn't as big of a deal to us. All in all, this is a great hotel and perfect for the first time in NYC!!","Regina, Canada","DarlaJ14</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Regina, Canada</strong>",2,4.0

Their staff was precious!!! Fantastic cocktails- great menu - we had few cocktails and appetizers. We had a lot to pack in during short stay so we did not have time to hang out at the pool, go to the fitness center- or comb our room w a magnifying glass looking for imperfections. We literally wanted to stay in very nice hotel- great central location- that was comfortable and great atmosphere. This hotel was perfect. Would like to add: Re taxi cabs, there are always plenty of them parked rt on the side of hotel ready to take you wherever you want to go. No need to get valet to call one for you. Also- most taxi fares were about $15.00 or less- for longer distance its best to take subway. Quick and easy. We plan to return to NYC .... soon. Will def stay here next time. Do your homework ahead of your stay to plan out your schedule- also, if you have an issue or need help, its best to not address that during peak check in checkout times, so that staff has the time to address your needs. This is a great hotel- great staff- and great part of your NYC experience! Lastly- just remember, Broadway is bright lights, busy, noisy, and a blast!

I checked in to discover that the request I made at the time of booking was not acknowledged. This was simple as having a room close to the end of the hallway/corner on the 40th Floor or higher (I booked Times Square View). The agent I dealt with advised that he didn't see any requests on file. Nonetheless, we ended up with 3409 on the 34th floor next to the elevator. The room itself of a good size and had a comfortable bed, but was clearly in need of TLC. The face basin in the bathroom has fracture marks throughout it, there was a tear in the blinds that forced sunlight through early on mornings and the shower curtain didn't look overly clean. The biggest disappointment for me was there being no fridge in the room as I had cold items I checked-in with and then had nowhere to put them. When I called and enquired about the fridge, I was told I had to pay $30 USD a day plus tax to get one? Really? I usually always stay at the Novotel two minutes away and all their rooms have fridges in them and they are comparably priced. Another thing that ticked me off is their $6 USD per package fee for collecting packages. That's the highest I've encountered in NYC to date. At the Novotel it's just $2 USD. Apart from what I've mentioned, the hotel was a good base to be at. It wouldn't be my first choice for NYC as staying here was an experiment but I will be heading back to the Novotel for my next trip in September. I can only suggest that there be more focus on customer service and less focus on excessive fees for simple services and possibly noting guest requests where possible with a view towards trying to honour them.",Barbados,"BGIWorldTraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barbados</strong>",594,3.0

This would have been the 5th time I stayed here. There were a number of pros and cons with my stay. Firstly I was a Priority Club Platinum Member (now IHG Rewards Club Platinum Member) and had made a Rewards Night booking for 4 nights using my points. My room was good and there weren't any major problems. Bed was comfortable and there was good Keurig coffee. Despite the Brasserie being closed for renovations during that time, there was a makeshift area in one of the conference rooms where a complimentary buffet breakfast was served. I was informed that I could avail of this as I was a Priority Club Platinum Member. The breakfast consisted of small items such as muffins, croissants and cold cuts. Unfortunately this good service was marred by the attitude of the check out staff. Before staying I was aware of the policy that Crowne Plaza offers free local telephone calls to Platinum Members. I also was told that they didn't charge for toll-free (1-800) numbers. I made a total of 5 toll-free calls and 3 local calls. On check out the gentleman who dealt with me told me that the balance I owed was $30. I explained that the calls I made were not supposed to be charged as per policy, and he rudely told me that ""it did not matter - any phonecall toll-free or local has to be paid for by any guest"". I stood my ground with my argument and knew what my entitlements were as a Platinum Member. Eventually he waived the fee but not without a fuss. Another problem that I encountered was the rude attitude of the Business Center staff. Overall the guy operating it seemed lazy. I went down to the Business Center and there was no one present for 35 minutes. As I needed to use the internet to send an important e-mail that was work-related, I proceeded to one of the terminals and use the internet. There was no sign saying that guests had to pay to use internet facilities. From experience I have stayed at numerous other Crowne Plaza hotels, both within and outside the US, and I never had to pay to use the internet there. In fact the majority of business centers were unmanned. Nonetheless, about 15 minutes later, a staff member of Egyptian origin came to me and started rebuking and shouting at me. He said that it didn't matter how long he was away - I shouldn't have used the internet. I argued that there was no sign or anything up. I also tried contacting front desk but to no avail. I then presumed it was an unmanned business center - as with previous IHG hotels I have stayed.A bit disappointed about these problems, and it will probably be a while before I stay here in the near future.","Silver Spring, Maryland","Steve Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silver Spring, Maryland</strong>",373,3.0

So our first night in NYC and we couldnt unpack or get out and see the city because we were moving rooms. The next morning we got up and went to find pablo. he wasnt in yet. Great. There had been a note left about us so the girl on the desk told us our luggage would be moved rooms while were out. we didnt want to waste a day in new york in a hotel. we asked for a guarantee that the room would be up to standards. This was given. We arrive back later that day to collect our new room key, and yet again the room was exactly the same. why was no one listening or going to look at the rooms???? i went down again and asked for Pablo. He listened and gave us another room and he himself came with us to see if this room was okay. AND IT WAS!!! why couldnt this have been done the previous night? why did we have to wait for a manager to sort us out?

There were always plenty of people around, but it was never TOO busy either. All of the staff we encountered at the hotel were fantastic; very polite and accommodating. Our room was on the 42nd (if I remember rightly) floor, so it was quite a trip up in the lift/elevator. We did notice other guests, but the lifts were never incredibly busy, it was a very calm and relaxing atmosphere in the hotel.The room was a great size; wonderful shower and toilet facilities and the view was surreal! Very strange to realise we were that high up above the ground - although it certainly helped drown out any passing cars and street noise. We ordered room service during our stay and were very impressed with the quality and time it took for it to arrive. Delicious food, definitely what we needed after a long day of travelling round the city! There was also a small cafe/delicatessen in the lobby of the hotel which we didn't use but seemed popular.

It was our first time in New York and we really enjoyed it. We were given a lovely spacious corner room on the 41st floor which had fabulous views from two huge windows up Broadway on one side and down Times Square on the other. That was a nice surprise! The room was right outside the lifts though so I was initially concerned about noise but actually we were hardly disturbed apart from the odd loud group waiting for lifts. We could hear sirens from the street now and then (which was quite amusing as it's part of NYC!) but generally it was nice and quiet. The bed was fantastic - very comfortable and we slept well throughout our stay (but that might have been down to the miles of walking we did everyday!). The bathroom was a good size with decent toiletries although the shower was not that powerful. The room only had plastic cups for tea/coffee which was not what would be expected especially for a 4* hotel. They provided us with a kettle on request so we could make tea. There was no fridge in the room but we were told they would provide one if we wanted one. We also had bathrobes and one pair of slippers (the other pair never turned up!). The guest services were brilliant and happy to oblige requests! The wifi was also very good. The lifts were quick and efficient. We were even given a late checkout on our last day which was great! The hotel is in an excellent central location, it is easy to walk to many attractions and there are 3 subway stations very close by to get around to places further away. Broadway shows are right on the doorstep as is the half price ticket booth and we managed to catch a couple of great shows. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel but there are plenty of eating options on the doorstep. The hotel has a coffee shop in the lobby which did reasonably priced warm bagels, muffins, coffee etc for breakfast.I was a little disappointed the hotel didn't do anything special for my 50th birthday but we had a good stay overall. It is a shame they insist on charging everyone a $30 daily service fee, even when you don't use the services. We weren't informed that this apparently entitled us to two free drinks on arrival (so we never had them!) and apart from using the wifi for a few mins each day to keep in contact with family we did not use the pool/facilities etc so it did seem rather expensive to have to pay a daily fee of $30 on top of the room rate (which wasn't cheap to start off with!) but we were aware of this charge before we got there so it wasn't a surprise. I guess it's what they charge you for a Times Square base. All in all a very good stay.

Staff were really lovely and friendly. Thing which let the place down was the tired, shabby look of our room - thinks we're chipped, peeling away, cracked, rusty. Our window wouldn't shut either so had to dial down for someone to come fix for us. View from our floor out towards the Hudson was lovely and the shower was really good - nice and powerful.

So, I know which hotels to investigate when traveling to NYC on a personal/family trip. Recently, my nephew made us all proud when he graduated from Mt. Sinai Medial School and we planned to attend the ceremony. I didn't have to think twice about which hotel to book for those five days. CROWNE PLAZA TIMES SQUARE is the Perfect Hotel for an extended trip. The location cannot be beat. Literally seconds away from Times Square which is such a happening place most of 24 hours every day. The facility is gorgeous and neat as a pen always. The layout of the hotel shows careful design with the bar/bistro area right next to the front desk. Very Classy. Most of the rooms are spacious and offer a view. Very Classy. Beds and bedding are comfortable. Very Classy, quiet elegance. Choices for food offer every variety. Food carts/trucks abound right along side 5 star restaurants throughout the area. Restaurant Row on 46th St. is a 3 minute walk. But, the restaurant at the Crowne Plaza is wonderful. We had the buffet breakfast most mornings and it was phenomenal. That being said, I must state unequivocally that the best asset provided by Crowne Plaza is its amazing staff. Literally every person we encountered working at the hotel was efficient, organized, prompt, and kind. They all exude a confidence in their respective jobs while showing genuine concern and warmth toward hotel guests. And, this is evident from the moment a guest enters the hotel. My family and I had contact with the group sales event manager, Gayle Richards, who personally looked out for us on several occasions in such a manner as to make us think we were the most important people in the hotel. Efficiency and style are the watch words to describe Gayle. The front desk has a team that works smoothly and quickly while always taking the time to completely meet the needs of the guests. When I arrived, Erika was on duty and, oh my goodness, what a delightful lady she is! She made several recommendations and took care of everything with meticulous care and concern for us. Vanessa was also on duty several days we were there and she always took care of any needs promptly and with a gorgeous smile. I observed that Evelyn not only always had a prompt, positive response to us, but attended to every guest in the exact same manner. Concierge, bell captains, food service, maintenance, and housekeeping work in such a coordinated manner that it is obvious they receive outstanding training and enjoy their jobs.

Not a bad price for a weeknight in Times Square. The hotel is very comparable to the nearby Sheraton although I found the public spaces and amenities and restaurant offerings to be much more accessible and practical than at the Sheraton. The fact that it was over 25% less in price was a nice bonus as well.Check in was smooth. The worker was nearly apologetic about the $30 resort fee which includes access to the NYSC on the 15th floor as well as two free house drinks in the bar. Even though she said I would be charged the fee, I never was. My corner room was spacious for NYC, only slightly dated. It was facing the wrong direction for great Times Square views but the view was decent. The NYSC was nice for a hotel gym but can't believe anyone has to pay to belong there. The locker room was so small and crowded that one could barely change for the pool. Equipment was standard. There were no locker room amenities so be prepared to pack and bring your own.

Hotel lobby is on first floor, you need to take the lift to go up. But at ground floor no one will direct you. Check in staff was so rude and unhelpful.

Trust me, I've waited much longer at check-in and been treated without a care.

Found a bobby pin and some small trash on the floor as if the room likely wasn't vacuumed too well between guests. The housekeeping was mostly thorough and did a good job in the bathroom and replaced towels as needed. Again, we could've used a vacuuming in the room but it really wasn't worth complaining about. The breakfast staff was very friendly and welcoming. The buffet breakfast was very good albeit definitely not worth $32.

Not at all what we expected. The hallway was quiet, too.

The brightest part is the contact made with Isis Arruda, the Crowne’s Social Media Manager. She reached out after my last review and definitely seemed concerned with my experience. She told me to let her know if I had plans to return to the Crowne so I did reach out to her, very last minute, and she reached out to a colleague about my stay. She has been great in her sincere interest to help create a better experience.Anthony checked me in and was great; very cordial, professional and engaging personality. I had dinner in the bar/lounge as the restaurant continues to not be open for dinner and room service is still in a paper bag and more takeout. Found a good table; sometimes it is so busy that it is hard to find a place to sit.

The room was comfortable with everything we needed for our stay; two double beds, en-suite, TV and tea / coffee making facilities etc and was cleaned daily and supplies replenished. We were on a room only basis and didn't eat in the restaurant during our stay, however we did grab a croissant or granola and yoghurt pot from the coffee shop most mornings for breakfast which set us up for the day nicely. Couldn't fault the friendly staff who always seemed genuinely happy to help; when we had a problem with the hot water in our shower one evening the hotel reception desk sent an engineer up to our room promptly to fix it. The baggage storage with the concierge on the ground floor was also really helpful and meant we could still do a full day sightseeing once we had checked out of our room on our last day as we had evening flights back to the UK. Would highly recommend this hotel if you are planning a trip to NYC and want to be based within easy access to a lot of the main attractions and good restaurants around Times Square.

This was fine as it was just them in the lane, but there were other guests who were less happy to do this and some people get snotty about kids being in the pool (ours are swimmers so weren't larking about and it's no good as a play pool if that's what you'd like to do).

I was a little fearful riding the elevator up with various people not sure who was legitimate hotel guest and club members. Aside from this issue and the ""Pool"" I like the hotel. The pool is really part of the NY Sports Club and is more like a Olympic style pool not very family friendly so my familyOpted not to go in although I was charged a $30.00 fee.

When it came I asked for soy milk (traveling the world in recent years I have never had a problem getting soy milk in a world hotel such as one would expect at the Crown Plaza). I was told they didn't have soy milk. So I walked to the coffee shop just around the corner beside the lobby to ask if they did, I ended up buying a take away from there and going back to the bar. I don't see why, when it is in the same hotel why this soy milk couldn't have been arranged for me (soy milk is available also in the main restaurant). The server wasn't helpful, answered me quite abruptly when I asked. So I ended up wasting $6, yes six dollars for a tea that I didn't drink at the bar.

The location is perfect for us, close to great entertainment, good restaurants and plenty of transportation.Our only complaint is that the hotel controls either heat or air conditioning (depending on the season) and individual controls in the rooms do not enable you to change the temperature.

I can't recall exactly but i think it was over $30 for the buffet and then they expect you to tip the waiter who didn't do anything to bring you the food, just took the order - and then took 15 minutes to bring you a cup of tea.Save your money and go to the Times Square Diner, it's on the opposite side of 8th Avenue, just south of 49th street,head out of the rear entrance of the hotel, it will take you 3 minutes to get there.You better hope it isn't windy when you travel there, the windows howl in the wind - very poor.","Bicester, United Kingdom","Richsawsedges</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bicester, United Kingdom</strong>",95,3.0

Was so excited to be staying in Times Square in such a nice room. However we arrived to a filthy room with crusty white stains on the couch (so embarrassing as our friends came to visit us), food crumbs on the table, wet feet marks on the bathroom floor from the previous guests, in a room nearly 80 degrees. We were unable to get the thermostat to stop blowing hot air despite multiple attempts to turn it down and off, so we called the front desk who said they were sending up help. Help never arrived!!!! We had to pry open tiny window gaps with pillows to bring in some cool air so we'd stop sweating and our infant wouldn't feel sick from the heat anymore. He was so overheated we had to strip him down and hold him by the pried window in a desperate attempt to sooth him. And he's an easy to please baby. It was just that insanely hot in the room. The crib we asked for at the front desk upon check in never arrived. The bathtub drain was broke and maintenance stayed in our room for an hour working to fix it Friday night. He never could, he was a very friendly man though. We finally had to ask him to stop for the night as we were supposed to be getting ready to meet our friends and it was obvious he couldn't fix it at that point. We had no place to bathe our baby. The shower knobs were all broken and loose. The toilet paper dispenser is dangling off the wall..... There is no microwave, nothing. For a penthouse suite? How disappointing! Had to warm the babies food in hot water from the bathroom sink. The manager of the front desk Chris, who was very polite said he could speak to us Saturday morning after he also came to the room Friday to check in on the status of the broken bathtub drain. We had last minute wedding plans to wrap up as my husband was the minister doing the wedding and I was the photographer. So we couldn't meet. The front desk called Friday night for a time to enter the room Saturday claiming they had to order a part to fix the tub. We said 11am would work as we would definitely be gone after eating and getting everyone ready (we have 2 kids) They never showed!!! Came back to a still broken drain. We tried to rig it with a washcloth so we could wash the baby. The view was NOTHING like the one showed online for Times Square. I was heartbroken to see that. It was very bland and dull. After the tub aftermath when maintenance finally left and we rushed to get ready to meet our friends for dinner and wedding discussions, we went downstairs to meet them at the bar to see they were already closed??? Ha!!! One thing after another. We wound up going out in the cold and wandering down to Applebee's who saved the day so we could have some food. So much for searching for a hotel with food downstairs. We never got any. Upon check out we were so disappointed with everything in our room and had to rush out for the ceremony Sunday morning that we didn't get to meet with Chris to see if we would receive anything for all the trouble. Instead we had the wedding and took the train home. When we came back to grab our luggage to hit Penn Station, we paid cash to take one of the vans from the hotel instead of a cab which cost more. We were shocked that they sat there in front of us fighting over who got stuck taking us. Even after we got in a vehicle they were still arguing. I was so uncomfortable sitting there with my baby on my lap I damn near wanted to cry. I just wanted to go home and get away from that place. The whole weekend was a disaster at the Crowne Plaza. I will never stay at the Crowne Plaza ever again nor will I recommend it to anyone. Wish I had gone back to the Hotel on Rivington I had stayed at before. Or stayed at our friends hotel, The Row around the corner. Less money, cleaner room, things not broke etc. Sounded like heaven after our weekend. I am a former housekeeping supervisor who later became a front desk evening manager/ night auditor years ago, I am quite familiar with the hospitality business and what could have been done for us to make us more comfortable. Nothing was done. Nothing. We were nice and understanding the whole time. Our infant got stuck sleeping in the bed between us since they never brought his crib either and we grew tired of asking for things that never showed. Maybe that's where we went went wrong. Had I been more ""assertive"" perhaps we would have received better service. ",,ronnieandchrissy,5,1.0

We could not complain about this hotel and would have no problem staying here again.Our room was located on the 45th floor and overlooked the Hudson River. The room was large enough for the two of us and was well maintained throughout our stay. Bathroom was fine with a good strong pressure from the shower. The bed was comfortable and large and the room was warm which was important as it was minus 9 degrees on Sunday.We had an initial problem checking in, they could not find our booking for 5 nights, but as we had our paperwork with us, this was quickly resolved and we were given drinks vouchers to the value of $30.00.We did not eat breakfast formally in the hotel as we are not big breakfast people but there is a small snack bar just beside the lift which enabled us to grab and go with pastries, hot breakfast wraps etc. I believe it opens at 7am to 7pm. We were celebrating a special anniversary and the hotel left complimentary wine and cake which we really appreciated.We had dinner one evening in the hotel and that was fine and reasonably priced. We found the reception staff, particularly Sandra and the doormen (esp Jim) helpful.

We were directly across the street from M&M World and right be t door to the Hersheys store. There's so much in that area that you don't have to walk far to get to anything you need like great restaurants, shopping, Broadway shows, etc. Xhexkin was smooth. We arrived about 1p and check in time is 3pm. Our room wasn't ready yet so we went over to the lounge and had lunch. The lounge is lines with windows for views up and down Broadway. Great staff, food was wonderful but pricey. We found out pretty quickly how pricey everything was in NYC. By the time we finished our drinks and lunch the room was ready. The hotel was pretty quiet and clean. There are different elevators to take you to different floors so make sure you look at the wall plaque next to the specific elevator to make sure you can get to your room from it. We were on the 15th floor. Our room was at the end of the hallway, directly across from the ice machine and soda machine. The room was clean and smaller than I expected. Im from the south so I'm used to larger rooms, but it was still a nice room. I understand the lack of space issue in NYC,so it was fine. The bathroom,is tiny even under normal circumstances. When opening the bathroom door it almost touches the sink. To get to the shower you have to close the door completely. The shower is roomy though, but the seal at the door wasn't good so we always had a soaked towel on the floor after showering. We had breakfast downstairs a couple of mornings which was good. No pancakes on the menu just fyi. I was a bit disappointed, but I opted for the breakfast quesadillas which was really good. If you don't want tk sit down to eat, there's another eatery that sells bagels/muffins/breakfast burritos/etc on the first floor. Overall we had a great stay and would recommend it to others.

For a start the hotel staff, in my opinion, are only interested in the tips. They are expecting it for the least thing. The clerical staff that we dealt with were nice. Especially Rhona who was obliging especially when our key wasn't working. However on arrival our rooms were not 100% ready as we had arrived early due to our flight. This was, of course, not their fault. I was disappointed, however with that fact that we weren't even offered a drink or a place to sit so therefore were pushed to the side and just expected to wait. When we eventually got into our rooms, it was evident - the place needs a makeover! The hotel is still stuck in the 90s in my opinion. It's very old looking and most things within are very grubby and used. Don't get me wrong the views are stunning from the landings and you're in NYC so you're not getting caught up with the rooms. However you certainly do expect a certain standard! On first inspection of our room I was shocked at the condition. Our shower tray had a huge chip out of it and our sink area was badly stained. The beds were fairly comfortable but the rooms were nothing special. Our view, also was pretty poor. We faced into an office space so there wasn't much to see.Overall my experience of the hotel was rather disappointing and I doubt I'll return.

The mirror was a really nice expensive mirror with the lights in the mirror, but the lights were out of the right side of the mirror which was the main light in the bathroom. Not a deal breaker for me but more of a pain for my wife to get herself ready. The wall paper was pealing away from the wall all the way from floor to ceiling. The caulk around the counter had holes/gaps, needed to be redone & the shower head was really low, I am under 6' tall and had to bend over to fit underneath the shower head. The door had at least a 1"" gap on the bottom which let in a ton of light in the mornings when we wanted a dark room. The walls were paper thin, we could here the conversations in the room next to us and could hear them using their hair dryer in their bathroom. None of these are big deals, just part of my expecting more. The lobby/check-in was very nice. Elevators were fast, never had to wait more than a minute.

She was amazing.On my check-in, MD Harris and Sylvia came over personally to meet my wife and myself, and other family members, congratulated me on my Big Birthday while Sylvia worked with the front desk to check on all the rooms and have them put under my credit card. I should point out that while MD Harris was chatting with us, other guests were greeting and thanking him for their stays. While I have been treated well in other Times Square Hotels (I am also a top tier member as I am with IHG), this is the ONLY one where the top guy in the Hotel made a personal appearance and this is one of the reasons why he stands out among so many senior executives running their properties.Well the surprise appearance didn't just stop there as I soon found out. No sooner had we checked in that Rodney Booij, Manager F&B, showed up with Yanzhi Chen, to drop off a really nice tray of goodies that was as perfect in style and appearance as I have received from Hotels around the world that we have stayed. But it wasn't just for me! Each of my overnight quests not only received a great room but received also the same tray of goodies (see picture). And to top it all, we had waters and soft drinks all during our stay.Thinking already what really generous gestures MD Harris had provided for us, after returning on Saturday night from a wonderful meal at Tao's, my guests were shocked and amazed at the Birthday Cake accompanied by Champagne and Processo that was wheeled in by Manager Booij, with candles, plates and cutlery! My wife who celebrates her Birthday every February at the same time as Basket Ball All Star, and who gets a cake every year for the past 5 years, was stunned at what I received on this special Birthday because it was no doubt the most delicious, colorful, moist Birthday cake we have had at any Hotel celebrating Birthdays. As you will see by the pictures, it was a wonderful surprise for all of us.Later in the evening a few of us went down to Bar that was just about to close and guess again, Manager Booij to the rescue who helped us get our drinks at a lovely Bar overlooking Times Square served by very efficient bartenders.Sunday morning as we were all having breakfast before going our separate ways, Manager Booij coordinated with the Manager at Breakfast to hold aside a few tables for our group, who came over to introduce himself and all of our guests enjoyed the Buffet Breakfast and service by staff (BTW please remember to tip all these staff whether it’s the Bar, Buffet, Housekeeping, Room Service ..).As it came time to leave, what initially seemed like a really unseasonable cold time to be in New York for a weekend (it was cold) was far outweighed by the warm, friendly, generosity of a Hotel that made this definitely my Best Birthday Weekend ever. My extended family and I thank Manager Niles Harris for showcasing the Crowne Plaza at its usual Best and for the leadership that he clearly extends to each one of his employees for their superior customer friendly service.

We did NOT use the pool/health club/fitness centre and we did NOT use the telephone.I understand why they have this fee, to keep these facilities going, however I find it absolutely shocking, when you do not use these facilities, that you have to pay for their upkeep.

Bar prices are very expensive. 3 straight jack Daniels came to $42. We never ate in the hotel at all as there are so many places to grab a bite to eat. Would recommend the New York Pass if you are thinking of doing the touristy things. We saved quite a bit. Try ""The Ride"" absolutely hilarious and included on the NY Pass. Also the big red bus is included on the pass. They do 2 routes. Uptown which goes up by Central Park area and beyond and downtown which goes by the Hudson River, 9/11 and ferries that go past the Statue of Liberty. You can hop on and off as many times as you like. The roads going across are the numbered avenues and the roads off those are the streets and are numbered.

Upon arrival, we were told that there was a system error, which meant that we could not check-in at this point. IT issues are inevitable, and we were promised that we'd be 'looked after' by another member of staff, so this was fine. However, we were not 'looked after' at all; 3 hours later and we had no updates regarding the system, and the member of staff was clearly not in a helpful mood. This was from from ideal, given that we'd just travelled for 9 hours, and couldn't even find anywhere to sit and wait. Eventually we checked-in and were satisfied with one of the rooms - after all, this is a fantastic location, and definitely serves its purpose (comfy bed, coffee machine and lovely bathroom). The second room was slightly grubby, and the bath was chipped. In all fairness, the rooms look like they could be doing with updating, but they're certainly not unbearable. The maids are very attentive too - in fact, they're far more attentive than any of the reception or hotel staff who're supposedly trained in customer service. I think our stay would have been far more enjoyable had their been better communications. We tried to contact the hotel beforehand via email/social media on several occasions, yet never managed to throughly clarify any of our queries. We also noted that we were visiting as part of a 21st birthday and how special it would be to have a nice view - something we didn't manage. Again, this is completely fair enough, but a bit of correspondence would have been nice. Not sure you're considered to be priority if you book as part of a package holiday. Another example of this is when we approached reception regarding paying for a late check-out. The member of staff was extremely dismissive, and I feel that this sums up the attitude of most of the staff there, which is really disappointing. There were a few exceptions to this - again, the maids were fantastic, and one of the younger members of staff was so helpful in giving us contact information for reception should we require anything for the rooms (something the 'receptionist' herself failed to mention...) Overall, an average hotel which could be vastly superior if the staff could learn to treat non US guests with a bit of respect.

They were truly the exceptions to everything else I have to say. Polite, courteous and personable in each interaction. NYC is always a blast, and when you're looking to experience Broadway; there is no place better to stay than Time Square. I've big to the Big Apple more times than I can recall; so I know what it looks like when it's Right. Our experience at the Crown Plaza was as indifferent as most of the service. The front desk staff truly fit that bill. Not rude; but definitely indifferent. During our stay it was apparent that ""customer focus"" was NOT apart of their culture. We had the opportunity to observe them as we sat in an area of the Crown Plaza's ""pay to play"" restaurant, hoping not to be asked to leave while we waited for our room.

The location is hard to beat as it's on the edge of Times Square which makes it just close enough to the fun but I can still walk to work without fighting the massive crowds milling around the heart of Times Square. The hotel staff is always professional, friendly, and efficient starting with Robert at the front desk. I always look forward to seeing his welcoming face. The rooms are clean and rather large, unlike many hotel rooms in New York City. You will have plenty of space for your suitcases as well as any shopping bags you pick up along the way without having to step over anything to walk around your room. I mention this because I've stayed in other hotels in the area that have tiny, tiny rooms. The bathrooms have plenty of good lighting, counter space, and decently powered hairdryers which I really appreciate! In all the dozens of times I've stayed at this hotel, my rooms have always been clean and well stocked. The Wi-Fi signal is strong and reliable, which is also very important to me. Should you need it, there's also a small safe in every room to lock up your valuables. The breakfast buffet is quite large with a wide variety of options from traditional American dishes to European meat and cheese options. There are also quite a few bread and pastry options as well as oatmeal, juices, cereal, fresh fruits, and yogurt. The restaurant is usually quite busy in the mornings, cut I can honestly say I've never had to wait more than a minute or two to get a table and the servers are very quick to take your order and fill your coffee mug. The restaurant also has windows all around so everyone is treated to a nice view.The hotel bar is a really nice atmosphere. Over the years I've found Jason, Marty, Phil, Keith and Kim to always be professional, yet fun! They do a great job of making everyone feel welcome. I see it over and over again, whether there is a first time guest or a returning guest at the bar, they take great care of everyone. Karim, one of the managers, is often nearby and is quick to share a laugh as he checks in on the guests and the staff. I've met so many interesting and wonderful people from all over the world at the bar. Stopping by for a drink is always a highlight of my trips to New York. I really can't say that I have any complaints about this hotel. Over the years, I've stayed dozens of times and had a really good experience at every stay.

First of all the hotel is ideal for being close to all the Times Square attractions but far enough away to not be disturbed by all the noise. We stayed in room 3227 which is 32 floors up and has a view of the Hudson River and Cruise Ferry terminal. The room itself could do with updating as it seems as though it hasn't been updated or decorated for a good 10 years or so. The room we were given had 2 ""double"" beds in which were quite small, which seemed to be a theme as the bath towels/sheets just about wrapped around any of us. There is no kettle in the room for drinks as there is only a coffee filter machine, so if you like milk in coffee or tea then you have to pay for a glass of it or use the powdered creamer supplied. The first couple of days the temperature was about -3 degrees C so we needed the heating on at night but it rattled that it kept us all awake so we either froze with the thin sheets on the small beds or were kept awake with the noisy heating. We did manage to get an extra thin grubby looking duvet after 2 nights. Be aware that they ask for a credit card to take a deposit for any breakages or films/services used and they actually take $100 out of your account rather than just a holding charge. They also tried to bill us for watching 2 films when we only watched one, and at $17.99 a film they are pricey. We will visit New York again soon but will probably look to book somewhere else rather than stay back here. Don't get me wrong it's not a bad hotel - it's just for a Crowne Plaza it is poor.

We said we didn't mind but took the offer of the better room. Arrived to a outdated room with a 'City' view room- even though we paid extra for Times Square. The bathroom and decor in general was very outdated. The bed was very comfortable. Went back down to reception for the receptionist to be very rude and say that we requested a city view- even though we did not. After a while a very lovely lady said she would swap our rooms in the morning.After swapping to a times square view room (43rd and 44th floor) we were happy. Bathrooms were more modern. Lobby is average- no seating area unless you sit in the bar. Asked about the pool at reception and was told you can only use if you swim with a shower cap on?? Never heard this before and have stayed in many hotels! After this we decided not to use the pool.Location is great- right in times square, could not fault this. Alot of hawkers outside the hotel. Also bar service is poor- they charged 4 x drinks to my mastercard as originally I said I would pay by card then as the waitress Michaela walked away we called her back as had cash.

Great location, clean good size rooms.Just a couple of little things stopped me from awarding it 5 stars.Firstly, our party of 6 reserved 2 Times Square view rooms, each having 2 adults and a child in each (age 6 & 16) somewhere along the reservation this was changed to a standard and a Times Sq room. A little annoying but the hotel stated there was no availability to move the standard to a Times Sq room and taking into account the time we'd be in the room and the only difference being the view we left it as.Upon checking in when we arrived at 2pm one family checked into the standard room with no issues. The family checking into the Times Sq room were told by the receptionist that a room on the 17th floor was available but if they didn't mind waiting until 3pm (which is the check in time) a room on the 25th floor would be available and this room had, in her opinion, a much better view. We decided to do this and wait.Upon returning at 3pm we were told by a different receptionist that we could check into the 17th floor room. When we said what the other receptionist advised us the original receptionist was asked and denied ever advising us about the other room !The other slight issue we had was the coffee shop in the lobby closed at 7pm. Which is something we looked forward to after long days sightseeing. We found this strange for the city that never sleeps !Having said earlier these issues would not prevent us from recommending this hotel for anyone looking for an ideally located property.","Leeds, United Kingdom","Kaisersmith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",57,4.0

Location, good size rooms, quiet rooms, even with the size of this hotel we didn't find ourselves disturb at any time when in our room by noise from other guests or from the streets outside, clean room, super comfortable beds.The coffee shop located by the reception was great, wonderful choice of drinks and snacks and a very friendly man who ran it, even at 7am one morning he was there with a smile.The bar is very nice, great views of the street below, comfortable seating, good choice of drinks and wonderful service. We were looked after very well by Tanesha, she was extremely friendly, chatty and very helpful. All the concierge team were also very helpful arranging a car for us back to the airport when we left. The only small negative I could say was that the reception team could be a bit more friendly. On two occassions at the desk (one was check in) we felt like they just wanted to get us processed and out the way. I would hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to others.","London, United Kingdom","Paula_elson1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",16,5.0

We've stayed a few times strictly for fun. We visited in January but the hotel was packed. We were there on New Year's day (not Eve) and the crowds hadn't really died down quite yet. Our room wasn't ready until around 7pm. We were offered complimentary drinks for the wait but they had very little alcohol compared to the drinks we purchased. We didn't expect our room to be ready right at check in time but we did have to wait quite a while which caused a bit of an issue with our dinner reservations. The bathroom did have some mold in the shower, not something we've ever seen before at this hotel. Usually, it's exceptionally clean. We were in good company so it all worked out in the end.

Now I am lucky enough to work in the travel industry and have stayed in a few hotels in New York such as the Wellington, Manhattan and the Marriott Marquis but thought I would give this a go as being an IHG member I had points to use.

In past times, I have stayed in more luxury hotels on Park Avenue and Lexington but this time with my husband we wanted to do the tourist things so I decided on Times Square as a location. After looking at various reviews, I chose the Crowne Plaza. The location is great. You have mid point between lower Manhattan for tours of Ground Zero and the 9/11 museum, and upper East side where you can stroll along 5th Avenue and the upscale stores. The metro stop is about 1 block away and there are so many restaurants within walking distance. Because the Crowne Plaza is at the upper end of midtown, you don't feel as much of the circus of Times Square. However, Times Square has certainly changed a lot from the last time I was there with putting in more family friendly stores ( M & M candy and Disney) and it has cleaned up nicely.The location of this hotel is the big plus. It is not a luxurious nor a really beautiful hotel. Walking in off Broadway, there were heavy black curtains past the door, likely to keep the cold from getting in but it was a bit of an eye sore. It also made me feel like we were going into a peep show. The reception area is average size and functional. The staff are very nice and accommodating. There is a Bistro open for breakfast and lunch and the morning buffet is good. The coffee is exceptional and the service very good. There is also a little cafe to buy breakfast items and coffee all day. Again great staff.Our room was on the 42nd floor. I had a king bed city view. The view was not all that good but we were not really there to stay in the room all day and look out. I found the room small but again it was functional. The decor is in need of refurbishing as the cloth headboard of the bed was becoming threadbare in places and the carpet is very dated. I also felt that the floor slanted in some places. It was kind of a strange sensation when standing next to the bed and feeling like you were leaning forward. The bathroom only has a shower, no bathtub. There are also no alarm clocks in the room (seemed weird as I always like to have one as a safety feature in case my phone alarm doesn't work). All that said, the hotel is a clean and comfortable place. A great location with wonderful staff. I would select it again if I was doing a quick weekend of shows and touring.",Mississauga,"PJwrites</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mississauga</strong>",53,3.0

We are very pleased we decided to choose this hotel as we were in 2 minds about this hotel and another but we chose well. The CP hotel is in an ideal location, very close to almost everything. The Rockefeller Centre, bus tours, Central Park, Macy's etc were all within walking distance which made it easier to get to places however the subway was also not too far from the hotel. We absolutely loved the atmosphere when we stepped outside the hotel onto Times Square. It really was a great experience and is truly a city that never sleeps. The hotel rooms were very spacious and clean. At check in, the lovely gentleman offered us either a room on the 40th floor or a corner room with a view of the Hudson river, which we thought was very kind and you also receive 2 complimentary drink vouchers. All the staff were very lovely however, there were two who particularly stood out and they worked at the bar/lounge (unfortunately we have forgotten their names). They were always very helpful and did there best to seat us where we wanted (which was on the tables closest to the windows, because of the view of Times Sq which was amazing from there). We would like to say a very special thanks to Rodney the Food & Beverages Manager. He was a lovely genuine gentleman and really looked after us following a minor issue we had with one of the bar staff. We were also offered breakfast vouchers as a result of this.

Our welcome by the Crowne Plaza Front Office Manager, Gabby, could not have been friendlier. Sincerely interested in our travel and plans, she recognized some weariness in us and went over and above to take steps to make us feel very welcome and ensure our brief stay was going to be a great one. We do have IHG Elite status and appreciate the greetings we typically receive at IHG property check-in, but this one was special. It was quite a treat to be upgraded to a corner room on a high floor with a view towards Times Square. CP properties usually do have some other nice perks for Platinum status and Gabby exceeded our expectations in that regard. She even gave us her contact information should we have any needs during this or future stays! How nice is that!  Needless to say, despite it being a too short stay, we enjoyed every minute of it. Such a comfortable bed and pillows, a nice sized bathroom with long modern vanity and a good soaking tub, and the view to both the west and south (Times Sq) The next morning we enjoyed a long, leisurely breakfast in the hotel's Bistro 1605.....a big buffet with many many choices, and some excellent coffee. After that, it was time to walk it off, so we did. We returned for a late, light lunch in the Bistro, joined by our daughter-in-law who works just across the way in the very visible BARCLAYS building.  After lunch it was off to a matinee THE FRONT PAGE (what a cast) then back to the Crowne Plaza for a 5 pm drink in the lobby bar and some food (crispy Kale flatbread and also Black Eye Pea hummus...both delicious) before journeying back to Philly. This Crowne Plaza property is wonderfully situated for access to theaters, shopping, Central Park strolls, and lots of restaurants (we enjoy dinner at nearby Trattoria Trecolori). If you are looking for discount theater tickets, it is just across from the TS TKTS booth for same day show offerings too. You can even keep an eye on how the lines are shaping up from the hotel breakfast room.

After researching dozens of hotels in the Times Square area, I chose the Crowne Plaza based on the size of their rooms and the fact that there's a bathroom vanity. Most similarly-priced rooms have much less space and only offer a pedestal sink in the bathroom. We were very happy with the size and never felt cramped, even when all three of us were getting ready in the morning at the same time.PROS: Good-sized rooms and bathrooms, many attractions in walking distance, staff were very helpful and accommodating, concierge provided great suggestions. If you want to be in the heart of Times Square - this is it! CONS: There's no way to turn on the A/C in the winter. Our room was a muggy 76 degrees, and there was no way to cool it down. On the plus side, the front desk sent someone to help us open our window and brought us a fan to circulate air in the room. If it weren't for this temperature issue, I'd rate the Crowne Plaza 5 stars.If you find a room rate that includes breakfast, go ahead and book it. It's much more affordable to include it in your rate than to purchase separately. The breakfast buffet was pretty good, and it's fun to sit in the restaurant overlooking the neon signs of Times Square. Overall, I'd stay here again.

The location is perfect to do all of the touristy stuff. Ground Zero is the only one that is a bit of a walk (roughly 45-60 minute walk both ways), but well worth the walk as you get to see a lot more of the city. Could easily get a cab if needed though. Everything else is, at the most, a 15-20 minute walk away from the hotel.The hotel itself is very clean and the service is superb. I was lucky enough to speak to Victoria (who has been mentioned plenty of times in these reviews) and have to agree, she was brilliant and incredibly helpful. Although Victoria does get a specific mention, I did find all of the staff helpful when needed.Would recommend people getting City Passes if they do want to do Empire State, Top of the Rock etc etc. The boat tour around the Island which departed close to the hotel was also brilliant.Plenty of bars and restaurants as you would expect around Times Square and Hell's Kitchen. Worth having a look on the Trip Advisor app for restaurants nearby if you are a bit more of a fussy eater. You won't have any problems finding something relatively locally!Got a yellow taxi to and from JFK (terminal 4) which is between $50-$70, thought this may be helpful for other people to be aware of as I couldn't see it in previous reviews.Would definitely come back to this hotel if/when I come back to New York.","Portsmouth, United Kingdom","jameslJ5877KD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portsmouth, United Kingdom</strong>",7,5.0

In fact, the customer service experience was so bad I would not stay here again.We chose the Crowne Plaza in Times Square for our New York trip due to the fact it was an IHG hotel and it offered a ""Ball Drop"" package for NYE.We paid a fortune for the Ball Drop package but thank god we selected that because it was our only positive experience of staying at the hotel (and that was because we saw in the new year in an exclusive pen out the front of the hotel, not because the hotel organised an amazing function).The customer service team were just disappointing. We don't expect a fuss but no one explained anything to us (as in anything; breakfast, the gym, New Years Eve arrangements, the lifts or even how to get to our room). We had selected an optional room upgrade (if available) but upon check-in nothing was offered (which is not surprising given it was ""here is your room key"" and that was it). However we must have been upgraded because my credit card was charged for it. We selected a non-smoking room but despite this we had the smell of smoke wafting in through the air-conditioning vents and resorted to trying to block the vents with paper after our complaints went unanswered.There is a gym in the building which IHG members get complimentary access to. It's quite good and worth a visit. The location of the hotel is good and a shout out to the lovely staff in the front bar - they were the only ones who made us feel like welcome guests.We changed hotels after our four night stay and the difference (starting from check-in) was unbelievable.

From personal experience and witnessing other reactions from guests, it was clear to me on more than one occasion that guests are just numbers and as long as you have your credit card and it works , that's all they need ( they don't have a passionate desire to serve you as an individual). I booked online and requested a bathtub. At checkin the staffmember was lazy and did not check the request. When I got to my room - there was no bathtub. I called room reservations and was told this would be looked into. After about an hour ( which was quite a long time to wait) I got a call from a Duty Manager who said sorry and I was changed to a room with a bathtub ( but not a king size bed room which I was initially in - I was put in a two double bed room). Clearly the duty manager was very embarrassed at this very poor customer service and I was given a free breakfast voucher and some drink vouchers. Although the hotel is quite expensive and I really think breakfast should be part of the room rate. At breakfast the staff were okay but they force you to sit at a particular spot - guests should be asked if they are okay with the table allocated. Some staff at breakfast need to be more attentive ( e.g. refill for glass of water needed?).Further on the bathtub - it was faulty. The tub empties itself as you are sitting in it - there was a problem with the drain stopper. I reported this problem and was told that it would be investigated - but I have no idea if it was ( I was not informed by email or a phone call - no follow up which to me means ""we don't care""). All I know is that the same problem was present the next night. Obviously top standards of customer service that focus on the individual needs of the guest are not a priority at this hotel.The taps on the bathroom sink are loose and not labelled with ""hot"" or "" cold"".Toilet does not have a strong flush and can block easily.Housekeeping lady phoned my room once to ask when I was leaving. I responded and then she just hung up without saying anything!Not all the items in the room were replaced everyday. I appreciated the two bottles of water on the first night but they were not replaced for the second night. Ear buds and note pads were also not replaced.There was dust in the room ( e.g. windows and glass table).Inefficient billing processes were witnessed. I had a long distance phone call charge on my bill. The service fee you pay includes free long distance phone calls so I had to spend time getting this off the bill. The service fee is expensive ( in addition to high room rates).I found the TV remote hard to use - it does not easily change channels when you want it to.2 pieces of soap was appreciated. As was a Bible in the room.No green tea was provided - had to ask for it.The bar in the lobby has a very rude staffmember who created issues with more than one customer and questioned what they were asking for ( e.g. there are no plates that come with your cup of tea and coffee - to place your spoon on for example - staffmember was difficult about getting a plate.) I asked for a glass of water and this staffmember forgot - I had to ask again. When I asked for a long black coffee she had no idea and said she cannot process that request. No other business in the world has ever had a problem with that request. I then looked at the menu to try and help her understand what I was wanting - I was very surprised to discover that the different types of coffee are not listed on the drinks menu! She did not seem to want to help guests - acted as if she knew best and did not cater for individual needs. Some of the above issues I could cope with if the room rate was not about $200 a night. But when you are paying that rate ( plus service fee etc.) you expect better - really high standards and quality service.In terms of location this hotel is right in the Times Square area. Lots of other hotels in the area so compare prices.I did receive good service from the information desk when I asked for info. re how to get to the airport. They booked a bus for me. However other staff at the information desk did not really empathise with me on other occasions when I asked for directions - just casually said ""it's over there , here"" - using map. They need to put themselves in the shoes of guests here for the first time. I am sure they would hate the service they offer if they travelled in a foreign country for the first time.","Sydney, Australia","Marty M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",64,3.0

Such a great way to start the morning after traveling the day before. Not sure how this would even happen, do they let guests schedule wake up calls past there stay and they are left on the room?The next major pain point was the shower. The valve for the water would slip (you spin it counter clockwiser to go from cold to hot), the problem is you would turn it to a comfortable temperature and it would slip down right to burning hot. The only way to keep it from sliding was to put the lever vertical which was ice cold. I was able to rig a rag around the handle to hold it in place, but this needed done whenever anyone in the family wanted to get a shower.The other issue was also the shower how quickly and deep it would pool several inches of water in the bottom.

The location is perfect. It is right at the start of Time Square. Walk out the door, turn right and 1/2 block and your there. Hotel has a nice large bar in the lobby area. This hotel is about $100 per night cheaper than Marriott and Double Tree and just as good as a location. The rooms are a bit smaller than Double Tree but are decent size. Clean rooms without any problems. Good WiFi, I did some work from my room.

Due to a snow storm, our flight got diverted to Washington on Saturday and we couldn't make our first nights stay. I phoned the Crowne Plaza hotel at 23:30pm to notify them that we couldn't make it for the first night, upon arrival in Washington-Dulles Airport. After three hours of sleep, we made a second attempt to get to New York - La Guardia Airport the next morning and we arrived there at 2pm on Sunday afternoon. Although we were 1 hour early for check in, we received a heart warming welcome from Evelyn at the front desk. We explained what had happend the previous night and Evelyn immediately talked to Chris (her manager) and we were told that we would get a full refund. Thank you so much! But this was not everything...we also got a free upgrade to a corner room with an amazing view over the city and the Hudson River in the background. The room was spacious and had great finishes. Sunday night, we discovered that our heather wasn't working and my husband phoned the front desk. In the next hour we heard a knock on the door and the maintenance department made a temporary fix and told us that I had to phone the maintenance department the next morning and that they would then do a full repair. Since then, we didn't had other problems with the heather and the room was nice and warm.I loved the bathroom, it looked updated, had a calming fragrance and it was stocked with an abundance of towels in different sizes. The hotels entrance is right on Time Square and all the stores were within walking distance! I highly recommend the Crowne Plaza Hotel and I look forward to my next stay. I want to convey a special thanks to Evelyn and Chris! Both of you are amazing and we really appreciate everything you have done for us.

Having previously visited the city myself a few times, we started to plan a yearly trip together. My mother had never been to America before, so based on location, we decided to try the Crowne Plaza Times Square. What a surprise! Thinking that the location would have its pros & cons, we wanted to get a feel of being completely immersed in the heart of the city. Especially as we were taking someone who had never been to New York before.To start off, Anthony (Tony) the doorman at the entrance is a credit to the company. This guy made us all feel so welcome with his warm and charming wit. My mom fell in love! He instantly gave the best first impression as he welcomed us into the hotel. He has some useful hints and tips about the city too. The girls at the desk were lovely and checked us into our room. The rooms are bright and cosy and so far away from the ground that you feel as though you are in a different location than times square. Its so quiet! There is a restaurant, bar, sports center, business center, convenience store and coffee shop all inside! Its a great atmosphere and perfect for what we wanted. I used the gym facilities early in the morning. The staff were lovely and attentive. The first time we stayed there was a faint smell of smoke coming through the vent in the room. We told reception to make sure they didn't think it was us. It wasn't bad, but unpleasant however for the amount of time we spent in the room it didn't really matter. We loved Crowne Plaza so much that we booked again for a second time. This time was equally as good and we were upgraded to a bigger room too! With all hotels, there are always some small issues. On the second trip we encountered some problems with the pluming and water pressure. The shower was blocked and the water wasn't very powerful. We spoke to someone at the front desk and they sent a lovely gentleman to fix this for us. The problem persisted for the last three days but as we were so busy we didn't have time to complain again. This was probably the only downfall of the hotel. But then again, we were up so high that water pressure is probably a generic issue. The store downstairs is a little pricey but there is a local Duane Reed and Walgreens in times square for room snacks/water etc. The food in the bar is amazing! The Cesar salad & the mozzarella sticks were so good! The barman was so friendly...the waiting staff can be a little impatient but I guess they are busy with lots of people to deal with. Overall I cannot rate this hotel higher. We love it so much that we have booked again and will be coming back this February. The views of the city are fantastic, although we have never stayed in a Times Square view room (I can imagine it is amazing!) we have stayed in a Hudson River view and a Skyline View room. Both of which were spectacular views of Manhattan. I love how central we are and how much staff are willing to help with directions or concierge related questions. The lady on the concierge desk was very informative. I would recommend this hotel to those who want the most from their visit to New York City...Amazing!

I had an incredibly beautiful handicap room on the 17th floor and was close to the elevator. My first impression is always that there is no lobby where customers can lounge without having to make a purchase. You can sit on a ledge, but apart from sitting at the bar/lounge, there is no normal lobby. The hotel is huge. I'm surprised that certain amenities that are located in less-expensive/smaller hotels don't exist. In the past, when I had to get connected(by phone) to the front desk, it always took a long time, sometimes not working ever. As a customer, the same thing seemed to happen this morning when the service person tried to contact the front desk at 7:30.... there was no response and my message had to be communicated... Frustrating.Positives:My room was spectacular- my bed was huge and very comfy-the bathroom was beautiful and everything in the room was spotless.The location for TOURISTS is incredible.I cannot emphasize this enough.Pablo at the front desk was a big hero after 20 minutes in the business center. Pablo copied and faxed documents for me with a smile, after hearing about my frustration with machines whose swipe cards DID NOT WORK (two of them). How can that be in a hotel such as this? Pablo is the man and I watched him interact yesterday, as well, with customers. Some negativesThe breakfast buffet ($40) was very nice, but there is NO provision (for $40) to have an omelet. I must disclose, however, that I had a $10 coupon for breakfast. The breakfast restaurant is spectacular. I did feel a little rushed, however, as the server kept asking if I had signed my check. Not ever having much vacation, I love to lounge during breakfast for an hour or so and I ALWAYS PAY THE APPROPRIATE TIP WHEN I STAY TOO LONG. My stay was very brief and I wish that I could have stayed another night for New Year's Eve.",PHILADELPHIA,"FRANKRAFFA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>PHILADELPHIA</strong>",52,4.0

This hotel offers ostensibly clean, basic amenities. The carpet in my room however left black marks on my feet. Mmm... No minibar was a disappointment for the price per night. Just a matter of basic convenience. HOWEVER! The location is this place's only plus. Clean carpets would be cool, but I only slept there. Be careful with the advertised free phone calls from your room. I double checked at check in that it was the case. Not so much to my surprise I was billed for calls. When I questioned it, they reversed the charges. Tourist trap? Don't know. Check your bill. But -great location. Do not stay here if you want to be cooped up in a pampered hotel room for a few days.",,evans816,9,4.0
