Tommy one of the doormen I can honestly say made my whole trip! His attitudeWas just so refreshing. Being a foreigner in NY and especially during this crisis a lot of people aren’t treating you the same as during normal periods yet our time spent with Tommy felt Asif the craziness wasn’t happening. He took us up to the Empire Hotel’s sign which unfortunately had been closed and was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel. He even took pictures of us which has been a huge challenge on this trip as no one fancy’s holding your phone! He showed us some other sites as seen on GG and just overall was lovely to speak with. Even managed to get us in the bar and have a signature “Chuck Bass” cocktail! He is honestly one of the hotels best assets. This is our first day here and I have to say will be one to remember- when everything returns to normality we will be back and most definitely returning to this hotel.

Location was great - right next to the Lincoln Center and quick walk to restaurants and the ABC building. Check-in was smooth. I was given a room on the 11th floor (their top floor). Upon walking into the room, I noticed it was hot and stuffy. The thermostat wasn't working so I called down to the front desk. They sent up an engineer, who wasn't able to fix the problem. He let the front desk know I wanted to change rooms. Luis from the front desk called me right away, was super nice, asked if I needed any help with my luggage, and asked me to come down to get a new room assignment. He explained that the 11th floor does get a little warm. He was about to assign me a room on a lower level, but when I mentioned the great view from the 11th floor he had another idea. He actually upgraded me to an amazing room on the 11th floor. The new room was amazing - living room, 2 bathrooms, bar, etc... Truthfully, it was still a little warm, but not nearly as warm as the first room. Unfortunately, I am a light sleeper and there was a lot of noise coming from above (the rooftop bar??) so I didn't get a great night's sleep. But that's not really the hotel's fault. In the end, I would recommend this hotel. However, if you like your room on the cooler side, I would request a lower floor.

We had booked a triple room for 3 adults but the first room we was in wasn't even big enough for 1 there was no room to put clothes a tiny hole to put a few clothes also no where to put any suitcases... especially because all three of us had taken large suitcases with us as we were due to stay in the hotel for a week. So originally we were very disappointed with the room because it was lacking in space for general living space! Also being three adults we were happy with two double beds but when we entered the room we then realised that the double beds are small double beds... which we were not aware of as the website does not specify, so if you are planning on sharing a bed in a triple room DONT, as the beds were basically a large single! As we were unhappy with our room due to the lack of space we headed down to reception just to ask if they had any other rooms available that were bigger as we didn't have anywhere to put anything let alone being able to even open our suitcases in the room. The receptionist Louis was very helpful and kind, he managed to transfer us to a bigger room as he explained that we were there for my daughters 21st and he wanted to make it as special as possible for us, he also did not charge us for the upgrade do to agreeing that our particular room could not fit 3 adults in comfortably. Our new room we were transferred to was a lot more spacious and actually had a walk in wardrobe to put our clothes in and to store our suitcases in! So that we didn't have to leave them on the floor and potentially trip over them! This is the type of room you should stay in if there is more than 2 of you or you actually want space to put your items, the only thing about the bigger room was that the beds were yet again a 'small double'/'large single' which is not ideal if you have to share... apparently all those rooms had the same size beds which isn't great especially as there is room to put a larger bed. But apart from the room drama the hotel was amazing the staff are very helpful and friendly! From letting them use the reception phone to call out or giving you directions round NY or hailing you a cab they were just great! If you stay at The Empire Hotel you need to check out the rooftop bar and restaurant the breakfast is great and the views up there are just amazing, you could sit up there all day just watching New York fly by!!!

On paper this is quite a premium New York City hotel. Just off Columbus circle, minutes from Central Park and a short walk or cab drive to broadway. I’m not sure if we were a bit unfortunate because we had a huge flight delay which meant we arrived at 4am, but the welcome was a bit underwhelming to say the least, especially for a city that doesn’t sleep apparently as there was no one to greet us at the door or help with luggage and the guy on the front desk wasn’t hugely welcoming either, I hardly got two words out of him.On getting to the room it was freezing, so we put the heater on which was the noisiest thing ever. I had messaged ahead to see if they had synthetic bedding which they say they do, but what they actually mean is they have synthetic pillows and a blanket, which is useless in December lets be honest.The next morning after very little sleep we went to try breakfast, which is served in the rooftop lounge. There was no signage anywhere to say that this could only be accessed from the hotel reception, and we got pretty lost in the hotel side trying to find it. I had asked in advance if they had gluten and dairy free options which they said was no problem, but when we got there the guy offered me omelette and chips at 9am, and they didn’t have gluten free bread or any specifically gluten free options which wasn’t what I was informed. We gave up on eating at the hotel and found somewhere else, which was actually much better and less expensive.I asked the guy at the desk if there was any chance of moving to a room with a less noisy heater and also if we could get a duvet, he was quite abrupt to be honest and said ‘look lady were fully booked, I’ll see if I can g set a guy to look at the heater but it will be later I get around to it.’ When we got back to the hotel they had sorted the noisy heater but still no duvet which I chased up with housekeeping and they were much more helpful.We had a room on the sixth floor. The room itself was ok, it could do with a lick of pint if I’m honest and some of the plug sockets were loose which wouldn’t happen in the UK because of our laws, but the size was good, the bed was comfy, and it was quite a decent view of Columbus Circle. The shower was good, but the bathroom would have benefitted from an extractor fan.We had another issue with the standard of service was when we were late for dinner, had got locked out of the room because our keys had stopped working and needed an umbrella. We went to reception to explain and he gave us a new key, but even though he had them available would not lend us an umbrella to stop us being any later through no fault of our own which ended up costing us an extra 40 dollars keeping an Uber waiting by the time we had waited in line for a new key and then had to go back to the room. This to me was pretty basic, they could have easily left a note on our room about the extra umbrella if they were so worried about it going missing.We managed to grab a drink in the hotel bar on the last evening and the service was much better here, as too was it on the rooftop bar in the evening when we went there afterwards and the waitress was very clued up on allergies and what was on the evening menu.Overall I’m told this is a good hotel experience for New York, but for me I found it quite a disappointing experience and I’m not sure I would stay there again.","Manchester, United Kingdom","trickyvickz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",18,3.0

The location of the hotel is fine and the rooftop bar and lobby area are good however would never stay here again. Our room and bathroom were tiny, our AC didn’t work and when a member of staff told us he would get it sorted, we were greeted to a knock at our door an hour later and another member of staff holding a tiny heater - no explanation given and he just walked off! We were also in a room that had what sounded like a generator running constantly and it was unbearably loud. We decided, at 12.00am on our first night in New York, that we couldn’t stay there as we knew it would likely ruin our entire trip so we arranged to go to another hotel that night. On checking out, the staff at the desk did not seem interested in discussing our issues or how they could best try and help which summed it all up.

We asked for it to be fixed, and they said that is just the way the old steam heaters work, so we ended up sleeping without heat the next 2 nights. It was better to be freezing that not sleep due to the horrid noise.- Check in - room was not ready until 30 min after check out time. Would not have been a huge deal, but in combination with everything else, it was just one more negative- Bathroom - Felt dingy, and there was a rusty wall/side of shower that I suppose was to make it look ""industrial,"" but it stuck out oddly and you had to be extra careful not to stub your toe on the rusty area that jutted out- Room - Everything seemed a bit dingy and old.

We had never been to New York or America before so were unsure what to expect on both accounts. When we arrived at the hotel, there was a door person to assist with our luggage straight away who took us straight to reception. We were greated warmly at reception and given complementary bottles of water. The room we stayed in had two double beds and a bathroom with a toilet, basin and shower. Although the decor is slightly dated, we could not fault the hotel on cleanliness. The room was cleaned every day, with towels changed every day and the sheets were changed at least once during our stay. The hotel also had a turn down service which was a bonus. As for location, you cannot fault the hotel at all. It was about a 10/15 minute walk to Central Park and about 20/25 minutes to Times Square. We wanted somewhere that was not too central, but not to far out of the action either and this hotel was perfect. Directly surrounding the hotel, there are a number of places to eat and drink, and if you are looking for something quick for breakfast, I would definitely recommend breads bakery which is directly accross the road. The hotel will also store your bags for you on checkout day if needs be. Checkout time is 12pm, and our taxi wasn’t until 1pm so we choose to have one last walk around that morning before it was time to depart to the airport. The hotel was more than happy to keep our bags for us until we returned. Depending on traffic (and New York traffic can be pretty hectic) a ride to the airport can take anywhere from 1 hour to 2 hours. I would 100% recommend this hotel whether it’s your first time in New York or your a regular visitor.

I thought that booking a larger room may increase my chance of a comfortable room on a higher floor with a good view. I was not wrong.The room was clean, comfortable bed and pillows, good clean bathroom with all standard amenities and at the end of the hall- quiet (still had some outside noise as expected with any hotel in NYC). There were 2 A/C units in room that provided a good continuous movement of air. I enjoy the white noise of the A/C units as it does help cover street noise easily and helps me sleep better. What was especially nice was the A/C units ran continuously so I didn't wake up like I normally do when typically hotel A/C units kick on and off and yet the temperature stayed constant as well.The only thing I didn't like was the ironing table. It was one of those little ones you put on top of a regular table. But, there are no regular tables in the room. It made ironing business shirts difficult. Iron itself was fine.As for the hotel and roof top lounge- clean, nice people, good hot breakfast buffet. I ate ""dinner"" late because of flight. So, no real entrees, just appetizers. Good food though. Note: no beer on tap.",,Warren L,0,4.0

The hotel has a rooftop restaurant/bar, with finger foods and drinks, which were a bit expensive, but par for Manhattan. Two biggest things: condition of the rooms and the resort fee. the rooms, most specifically, the bathrooms, need updating. Paint is peeling, doors and roughed up, etc. There are several pictures from other guests, so you can find them on here. Also, the resort fee is a joke. I will be challenging them, as $22 for a hotel that does not have a pool open, and I don't intend to use the gym is basically charging you for internet (which they aren't allowed to do) and water.

We had booked a twin queen room, but on arrival were shown to the smallest room I have ever seen with a single queen bed squeezed in. Needless to say, we turned straight around and spoke to reception, who confirmed we had in fact been booked into a queen room as per the request from TUI. There was no problem upgrading and luckily they had a junior suite available, which is what we wanted in the first place. I Can't fault the staff as they were always friendly and very helpful. The location is very good and for first time New Yorkers like ourselves, wasn't too much of an assault on the senses. We arrived late on the first day due to customs taking 3 hours! Yes, 3 hours at JFK. Anyway, by the time we arrived and were able to sort out our room, we were so tired, we just wanted somewhere local to have a bite to eat. Luckily, there is an American style restaurant just on the corner called PJ Clarkes and we had a very pleasant beer and a burger. The next morning we had breakfast just across the road at The Smith, which has great reviews and while we were there was always very busy. If you're staying in the area, I would suggest you eat here at least once as the food is excellent and sets you up for the day. Finally, if you need a quiet room to sleep, I would s suggest staying somewhere where the air conditioning isn't so loud. My wife had to were eat plugs it was that loud.

I don’t often write reviews, but when I do it’s to celebrate a real find. Our exceptional experience here was due to the outstanding staff. From the moment we arrived, I felt welcomed and appreciated. Lovely Maggi at the front desk is the epitome of graciousness. You knew right away you were in the good hands of someone who really cared about you and making you feel comfortable. Her natural elegance elevated the check-in experience. I also enjoyed the humor and courtesy of Chris at the front desk that morning. We came in after a red-eye which can be a grind. The professionalism and personal touch of each member of the staff helped start my stay in New York off right. Eugene at the front door was the personification of hospitality. He continued to be a valuable resource for me throughout my stay – recommending some outstanding options for morning coffee and other helpful answers to my many questions. Best of all, when I needed some service outside of his hours on duty (like car service for our trip to the airport), he connected me with his colleagues Brandon who, along with Naz, continued the standard Eugene set for me of excellent service from the Empire Hotel staff. The hotel building is over 100 years old and I enjoyed the charm of the vintage touches. The pushbuttons inside the elevators have a patina that remind you of all the history in the building. The main lobby is dark and cool (perhaps in keeping with the bar area it encloses), but still comfortable with lots of seating and a grand staircase to the mezzanine. Our 6th floor room was cozy, but included a large bed, dresser, desk, and two chairs. I loved the bold choice of the dark print wallpaper in the hallways. Our room had a big window with a nice view of the street. I never heard noise from adjacent rooms and only the occasional activity in the hallways. The bathroom had a terrific shower! It had both an overhead rain-shower and hand-held wand options. Not much counterspace around the sink, but lots of shelf space nearby. There was a small refrigerator in the closet. Also in the closet – a sturdy full-size umbrella the hotel provides for you to use during your stay (you can take it home for an additional $30 charge to your room). No in-room coffee, but you do get two free bottles of Fiji water each day (which you pick up yourself from the front desk). An innovation I really enjoyed was the magnetized “do not disturb/please make up the room” sign. You just stick it on the outside of your door with the appropriate message facing out. No more annoying door-hanging signs fluttering away when you close the door. Be sure to visit the rooftop restaurant!! Stunning views from multiple levels. Coffee and a menu as well as a full bar. The Empire Hotel location is outstanding – across the street from Lincoln Center and a Duane Reade drugstore right around the corner. We had terrific meals at restaurants on the same block. You can quickly connect to all the city has to offer via close by subway or a cab. A tiny park across the street is a welcome oasis when you want a break. The Empire Hotel is a gem that shines bright thanks to the good people who work there.","Los Angeles, California","A W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",2,5.0

Entrance and doormen were very lovely and welcoming, great lobby and a good start to our stay. We were given a very nice room overlooking the street with a slight view of central park and lovely buildings opposite. Bathroom was smallish but nice enough. The pool however was disappointing. We all laughed out loud when we first saw it as it was much smaller than we had anticipated but was happy enough and not overly surprised as the hotel seemed good value for a pool and the UWS location. Annoyingly however the pool had such high levels of chlorine that after half an hour on day 1 our eldest son couldn't even swim in it as his eyes stung so badly. Throughout the day other children visited the pool and complained of the same thing-burning and stinging eyes. It was so bad that their eyes totally puffed up and they didn't even want to go in it. You could smell it strongly on their swimwear. We did complain about it to the pool attendant but nothing was done. it remained that way throughout our stay. Although sadly, he was filling in for someone else apparently so he was pretty disinterested. Such a shame as that was the point of us staying in a hotel and not with friends. The deck itself was small but fine and the bar/roof top was very nice with fantastic views and helpful staff. All in all I would recommend this hotel but do not book here for the pool, especially if it's for children.

But I can say that everything negative that has been written about this hotel is true – and more.I was originally given a room with an air conditioner that did not function. But it was the middle of the summer! The temperature outside was 35 degrees celsius / 90 Fahrenheit. The room needed a functioning air conditioner desperately. The curtains were torn and the shades were broken. Not good for a room full of afternoon light. I complained, but was told there were no other rooms, I complained louder – and they relented, but only when someone went up to see if I was telling the truth. Go figure.The rest of this review is about the new (second) room and the hotel itself.There is Good, there is a lot of Bad and some Ugly.THE GOOD: The lobby is spacious and quite hip in its tackiness. I liked the lobby bar, although expensive, and they don’t offer complimentary peanuts or pretzels. You have to buy snacks and that, too, is pricey, but all in all, it was a comfortable place to hang out in and have a drink after a busy day. Most of the receptionists were quite nice – if you weren’t complaining. Unfortunately there was so much to complain about that in the end it tried their nerves and mine. But there were a couple who kept their cool and remained charming.The location is excellent. My room looked out over Lincoln Center.Once I finally got a room with a functioning air-conditioner, the air conditioner worked fine and was not at all loud, thank goodness.The bed was great, as well as the assortment of pillows.My room was spacious (it was more expensive than a standard double, a Deluxe King).Housekeeping did a good job.THE BAD: The roof-top bar was extremely loud and crowded. It was hard to carry on a conversation. The pool was tiny. Actually, ridiculous.The rooms I and my friends occupied were VERY tired, almost shabby. The switch on the standing lamp was broken, so it was hard to turn on and off. The window shades were hard to pull up and down, but they did work. The furniture was chipped, the rug had stains, the bathroom is tiny and there is very little shelf space. The safe was placed at the bottom of the night table, cramped in between the bed and the window. You had to get down on your knees to open it and put things in. Very uncomfortable. THE UGLY:The windows were filthy!The Internet was a joke and was integrated into the stupid resort fee of $25.00 a day! The Internet was sloooow and I and my friends were continually, any time of day or night, bumped out – right in the middle of reading something or writing an email or whatever. We complained. And complained. And finally they did not charge us the resort fees.All in all: if I didn't have to, I wouldn't come here again. It was chosen because it was a five-minute walk from where we had to be and was reasonably priced. But in the end, I would rather pay a bit more and feel like the owner of the hotel really cared.","Berlin, Germany","H_J_Berlin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>",67,3.0

Room was spacious and bright and clean. Comfortable bed with nice bed linens. Front desk staff were incredibly nice and helpful. My only negative comments are:1. the pool area.. the reason I chose the hotel was because there was a pool with loungers to relax by. But there was very loud music playing continually so I couldn’t use this area. What a pity. It could be so nice up there. My friend and I went up to have lunch but didn’t stay because of the loud music. I understand having music in the bar on the floor below, but why not make the pool area peaceful and relaxing? Surely It’s what people need in a busy city like NY?- Twice I found a small cockroach in my bathroom. The bathroom and bedroom were very clean so cleanliness wasn’t an issue, but the hotel needs to do something about its pest control. I don’t want this to spoil my review as I was very happy in the hotel (apart from the pool). But just something they need to deal with.
