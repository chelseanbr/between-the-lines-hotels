Plenty of eats around, from ramen to Sushi to Yakitori and Sukiyaki. It has great izakayas or Japanese pub for the salarymen and great to chill after a long day of business. It is otherwise also a seedy location after 11 pm where the area is also is a known red light district. Around APA you can prostitutes standing around from midnight.About this hotel, I have stayed here multiple times as I am in Tokyo every 2 months or so for business. My work takes me to Nakano, Shibuya and sometimes Ueno. Usually I would also make a trip to Osaka by Shinkansen. Hence Shinjuku is at the heart of all my travels, extremely convenient. Though there are other choices such as Prince etc another reason I love this hotel, is because I smoke, and they offer smoking rooms. As I understand, many travellers hated this hotel for the same reason, as even if they request for non smoking room, they can smell the tobacco. Another of my love of this hotel is they have a rooftop onsen free to guests. Nothing like a hot dip after a long day of business to sooth the nerves. Only complain is the onsen is very small, and usually full of rowdy tourists. Also be warned, the rooms here are very very small, you dont even have space for a large luggage. As I am here for work and not shopping, I didnt mind the size. Some other travellers complained the staff are rude. I would say probably some of the lobby counter staffs. Most room cleaning staffs are very nice. Some counter experience aren't so great. But since I am familiar with the hotel and their amenities, I didn't care much what the staffs say as I am aware the check in process is automated. Passport and form filling is a necessary procedure for hotels, even though I am here every 2 months staying at the same hotel, I fill in my name and particulars every time, even though I was pre-booked. That's procedure for you, no exceptions.Lastly, this may sound weird, but that's how unflexible the counter staff can be. Came in on a red eye flight, arrive 9 am, the room is not ready, ok I understand, deposit luggage and goes out to work and come back to the room in the afternoon is fine. Though if you ask for a toilet use so you can freshen up, they will direct you back to the public toilets back where you came from near Shinjuku station. Though level 2 they have a restaurant, Common Room, with multiple toilet facilities. BUT their point is, you are not a guest YET. So no. You can't use the toilet. So yea, be prepared. Freshen up at Odakyu or Lumine at Shinjuku station ahead. At APA, when you haven't get your room, you arent their guest.",,StefanS2173,1,4.0

The hallway is super cold as if the tower was open at the top, so the cold immediately creeps in if you don't crank up the AC, temperature control can be tricky. The pillows and the bed were uncomfortable AF.

I choose this hotel whenever I visit Tokyo as it is conveniently located near Shinjuku Station (East Exit) and there are a lot of shops and eateries nearby. Although Kabukicho is supposed to be the ‘red light district’, it didn’t bother me much. Most of the touts didn’t really disturb me when I passed by at night. The hotel is basic yet clean and comfortable. The room is small (as expected of Japanese hotels) but the bed is comfortable (although the pillow is too thin!). The sento (indoor bath) at the top floor is a great place to relax after a long day out. The staff are courteous and provide great service (as with most service staff in Japan).

We booked through booking.com and I would have noticed this if it was explicitly listed during booking, so unfortunate, but not the hotels fault. I asked at check-in whether they had any non-smoking rooms but they said they were all full, again, not their fault, just be weary during booking! The room did smell of smoke but we opened the window as far as it would go (which wasn’t far unfortunately as it was one of those high-rise windows that only open a crack). The room did have a air purifier though which we put on. Once you got used to it it wasn’t too bad, and when we left I was smelling our clothes and bags and no smell seemed to stick. The room was however very very hot, and I tried the air conditioning but to no avail.I am sure if I went to reception they would have helped but I was only there such a short time I just let it slide.

I would say to date this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed in with abysmal service. We arrived at the hotel at 3am, following 12 hours of travelling, to find they had cancelled our booking following an email they sent to us not even 24 hours before requesting we mail to confirm the booking, even though we already had and had provided card details for them to take the payment. We sent a further email just one hour after their email to advise we would still be arriving and after 12am due to our flight. The receptionists could speak limited English and even with a translator our point and frustration did not seem to be getting across. As a resolution, they offered to put us in a smoking room which was something we did not want to do and advised of this but with no choice at all we felt stranded and had no where else to go at that hour so had to stay. This audial brought me to tears and once we seen the room, things were even worse. The room stank, it was unclean, there were holes in the sheet and we could not breathe. To top things off, the AC did not work in over 30c heat so as you can imagine we would not sleep. We reported this to the hotel but again, nothing was done about it. No apology. No refund. Nothing. They then offered to move us to a non-smoking room which was obviously what we had booked, they told us to leave our cases downstairs and once we arrived back at the hotel, the cases would be in our new room. Upon return, needless to say the cases where still in the lobby and our room not sorted. This had become our worst nightmare and ruined what was otherwise a great holiday.

The other ""reward"" was a room on the bottom floor close to a blank dirty wall (their website does not offer choice of room placement. The light from the window barely changes from night to day. The room lighting was also dim, so we were constantly in gloom. With 24 floors above us, down elevators often arrived full so going down one or two floors could be slow.

Other irritations were a TV that switched on with the same loud advertising each time we entered the room and precious space in the room given to publications with the opinions of APA's president.The hotel was very well maintained and everything worked well, except that the beds seemed soft and lumpy. The room was very quiet, but we didn't seem to be able to cool the room and opening the window was not allowed. Housekeeping was excellent, and made sure the extensive amenities were well stocked.

Usually, hotels would allow you to have a different room or check out a bit later if the hotel isn't full.The only good part is that the towels were very clean and the shampoo and conditioner (Shiseido) were nice.

We immediately went to the reception area and reported it, and they immediately gave us a new room. We didn’t use the comforter anymore as we are afraid of the bed mites. We just requested for extra bedsheets.

They’ll give you free bottled water each day that you request they do not change your bedsheets, but they require the sheets to be changed every 3rd day, and will not take ‘do not disturb’ as a request. I have tattoos so I could not have entry to their bathouse, but I’m a foreigner in their land, so I can’t complain about the culture. I still would recommend this hotel.The AREA the hotel is in is another thing. Kabukicho is quite seedy, and if you look like a male foreigner, expect to be harassed by African Men (I’m black myself, but you can tell by their accent) trying to scam you. One followed me for nearly a block as I was heading to Robot Restaurant, and would not take ‘no’ for an answer. Due to jet lag, I was up at 4am and the streets were still packed with people drunk out of their minds. I know this all sounds negative, but it was so cool to experience haha.Back to the hotel. There is a Family Mart and 7-11 within a few steps where you can buy booze around the clock, as well as get food for your room if you choose to not eat at the hotel. There is no microwave in the hotel rooms, so be sure to have the convenience stores heat up your meals (they offer to do it before you even pay.).

Listen I know that it is mentioned in every single review for this hotel but I'm not joking when I say that this is the smallest hotel room I've ever seen. This is pretty much the norm for Tokyo unless you want to pay a premium or choose a hotel far from the action. The bed literally touches 3 of the 4 walls. If you are two adults in this room and you want to relax a little before going out or in the evening one person will need to be on the bed and the other using the desk because there is nowhere else to go. You will not be able to open two suitcases at the same time.Now that I've gotten that disclaimer out of the way I need to mention how great the location is for this hotel. It is literally in the heart of Kabukicho. You want things to do, people to see, places to eat and arcades to play at? This is the place to be! Karaoke, sure! Clubs and bars?

This place is a short walk from two different subway station including Shinjuku station on the Yamanote line.The hotel was surprisingly quiet, there was more sound coming from outside than from inside. We also utilized this hotels' parking lot. The hotel has a manned parking garage which offers a really good rate (1200jpy for the night). We arrived really late and still managed to obtain a parking spot even though they are limited. If ever it is full there are two other pay lots across the street.The micro washroom was one of those pre-built plastic units. Very small but very clean and the soap/shampoo was of nice quality. The bed was comfortable and the Television worked well. The only negative I have about the room was that the carpet vacuuming could be better in the corners.English communication was not a problem at this hotel.The only advice I will give you is if you are a tourist in Kabukicho beware of the TOUTS. They come out at night and they target anyone who doesn't look local! They speak English and will approach you trying to pass as a club/bar promoter trying to get you into their shady bar. DON'T.

If you want to explore other parts of Tokyo, the Shinjuku Train Station is near. It was September 24 when I roamed around Shinjuku and the night life was so alive and intense. The throng of people in the streets mirrored the electric vibe of Tokyo. However, if you want to have your much-needed nature rejuvenation, Shinjuku Gyo-en National Park is also nearby. Walking distance from the hotel, you can spend your entire day exploring thr garden and its splendor. After a long yet fufilling day, you can rest in the comfort of your room and enjoy the huge tv. Or you may choose to look outside the window and marvel on Tokyo’s skyline. The facilities are basic yet complete. To give you enough energy for another day of walking and exploration, their buffet breakfast can nourish and satisfy you. I especially like the salmon, Japanese rice and salad. It is a bitexpensive compared to buying breakfast at the convenience store but the comfort, variety, and ambiance of the restaurant will compensate. It could have been great had they thought of putting iron inside the room. During my stay, no iron service is available.

Firstly, we noticed after a few days that the room wasn't vacuumed or dusted during our stay. We are clean people, but dust happens.Secondly, we had a do not disturb sign up during one day when I wasn't feeling well and wtanted to sleep. They called the room to ask if we wanted it cleaned. What's the point of a do not disturb sign of they call you anyway? The second time we had the sign up, we weren't disturbed, but staff left a laundry bag with fresh towels and amenities at our door, which was perfect.We didn't use them however (we don't require a daily change of towels, environment and all that), and the next day staff left the bag awkwardly in the very small room, so we ended up with two pairs of towels/amenities. Since the room was already small, this took up unnecessary space.Our room was on the 22nd floor, but we felt the outside noise was more like we were on the 3rd floor. I was expecting some noise because of the area the hotel is in, but for a new hotel the sound isolation could be much better. We had no staff interaction after check in, except for the unwanted call. You get your key at a machine, you don't pass reception when entering and exiting the hotel, and you leave your key in a box when you check out.Having said that, our stay was not unpleasant. The beds were good, the water pressure was good and consistently warm, and the location is very convenient. I appreciated the laundry bag when we had the DND sign on, and we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel before the official check in time.Price/quality was not perfect, you mostly pay for the location.3 stars because of location, beds and bathroom. 2 stars deducted for cleanliness and calling because we had a do not disturb sign.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","dutchchristine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",12,3.0

We knew that the rooms were going to be small so we were prepared and had only a carry on and a backpack so we sort of manage moving around but it was tight. On the other hand, the room was super clean, had a wide window, TV, WIFI, fridge and bathroom (equally small) with strong pressure and plenty of hot water (beds and pillows were not the best though). One thing that I liked is that it was super quiet, I’m a light sleeper and I never heard the neighbors but it might be also that there is an AC portable unit on the floor which added a bit of white noise. Due to the size, the room really cooled down in minutes, and this was a relief during this year’s hot days. Based on the videos that I saw of rooms at this hotel, I think this is definitively one of the smallest rooms that most people complain about, but there are bigger rooms so just pay attention to what you are getting; we wanted to save $ so we choose this room and did not disappoint. The location is great as you are in the middle of the Shinjuku that you see in the pictures in 1 minute. I need to say that there is a plaza in front of the hotel and at least during the weekend there were a lot of drunk and completely wasted people (woman and man alike) and to my surprise, lots of trash in the street in fact, in our two weeks trip this was the only place where we saw this situation, of course everything was clean next day. We always felt safe and due to jetlag we went out for food very late after 1am and there were plenty of places open, we choose Ichiran Ramen and we were in and out super-fast. One other thing, we choose the Airport Limousine bus to get to this hotel from Narita, we did this knowing that we didn’t want to deal with the subway system, however, the ride was long maybe 1.5hours or more, it was OK for us as the bus was empty and we just slept the whole ride. Make sure you have a print out of google maps on how to get from the bus stop in Shinjuku west to the hotel; basically, when you get out of the bus, keep walking to the left as soon as you get off the bus walk for 5 minutes in which you will be passing other Shinjuku exits, you will get to an area under a bridge, cross this street, you can keep walking straight and pass the Shinjuku Cebu station then make a right. The hotel is really tall with a sign that says APA so keep looking up and you will find it. All in all, this was the least expensive option in the area so will stay here again only if I get a good price, it will be hard to pay more than $150 for a small room but I will be willing to pay that for one of the larger rooms.","Adjuntas, Puerto Rico","silarem</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adjuntas, Puerto Rico</strong>",117,4.0

You can only stay on one side of the bed as the other side of it is by the wall with a small window and curtains. The bathroom has a small deep bathtub and the sink on the left side is somewhat low if used by a taller guest. The bathroom is elevated from the floor.

The bathroom also was smaller but again big enough to comfortably use. The bathroom amenities were fine.The breakfast was just ok. Nothing special but enough to go away not hungry. The scrambled eggs were runny, much like I have seen at other Asian buffets. I haven't had breakfast at any non-hotel restaurants in Japan, so I can't compare the cost with them. There are Family Mart stores nearby if you want to get yogurt or other items. So if the cost of having the included breakfast is more than $15 dollars extra, I would go with the non meal option.I would defiantly stay here again if in the area.

Like many other reviews have mentioned it is located smack bang in the middle of all the night life activities such as bars, food, host clubs and arcade gaming.The amenities in the room are good; including daily bottle of water and replacement of towels/bedding/bathroom consumables.The room size are typical for Tokyo and we had to be quite creative with navigating around our luggages inside the room.The top floor public bath was fantastic after a day of walking around the city. They are male/female separated and naked only. Best part was that they had outdoor bath for that cold air/hot water onsen feel. I do wish they provided towels up at the bath but i guess BYO from your room is more environmentally friendly.One thing i did wish they had was a public lounge area where we could catch up and chill (our group were in 3 separate rooms) or perhaps the cafe allowed that?

It's right next door to a convenience store and lots of typical Shinjuku madness. Checking in is quick and easy, and checking out is even quicker (just slip your room card in the machine). Security is tight, too.The room was comfortable (albeit small) - nice bed, perfectly nice bathroom, amenities like a kettle and hairdryer, etc. And the staff were friendly, which was nice because in big cities like this you can sometimes fail to get the usual super friendly and super attentive customer service Japan is known for.But I couldn't help feeling it was overpriced because I didn't get everything the hotel offered. Free wifi didn't work at all. I connected to it and then it only half-loaded all the pages, which would have been a nightmare if I'd had essential work to do or communications to make. I was only there for one night so I put up with it, but it would have driven me mad if I'd been there for longer.They asked me when I checked in if I wanted to pay for access to films on my bedroom television. I said no to this, which turned out to be a good thing. Not only was there nothing to watch on the regular channels (I speak Japanese, but if you don't then there DEFINITELY won't be anything for you), but when I had a look at the stuff I would have been paying for I was glad I hadn't - load of rubbish.This hotel doesn't go above and beyond for you. It's the bare minimum and not even well priced, so I wouldn't recommend it. I've stayed in Shinjuku before, and at that time I paid less than half the price of this hotel for an airbnb apartment, which had SO MANY amenities, SO MUCH space, WORKING WIFI, and more.

The rooms are expensive in Tokyo and worse yet, tiny. Having said that, let me give you some pros and cons for this hotel.Pros1. Location. It is located centrally in Kabukicho. It is in the heart of a happening place. They say this area is the red light district but we didn’t see anything terrible in the area and some risqué bars seem to be well hidden. The Shinjuku Tokyo Metro and JR Stations are within 5 minutes of a brisk walk. There are movie theaters, Godzilla Head (can be seen from our hotel window) and best of all a Family Mart are right next door! The Shinjuku Guyen National Gardens are also within a 15-minute walk.2. Water temps and pressure are perfect. We never had any troubles with heated water and pressure.3. AC. It was a bit cool in the room as we were there during February but the heater worked perfectly fine.4. Amenities were abundant and plentiful5. The staff was ok and spoke decent English. They weren’t out of the way nice and friendly but they did help when we asked.6. Check in and out was very easy and fast.Cons1. The room is super small and with two pieces of luggage it was a bit frustrating.2. The shower and bath were tiny but I guess that’s the norm here in Tokyo. The public baths were open during our stay but there is a men’s and women’s section and not coed so my wife didn’t want to be without me. I also was unable to use the public bath because I have tattoos.3. The pillows are super thin but we asked for more and they quickly obliged.4. Coffee was provided but we didn’t find it till the last day as it was in a hidden compartment and our suitcases concealed it, sigh.5. The microwave and ice machines are only located at the top (28th floor) next to the public baths.Overall it was a pleasant experience even though the room was tiny. It only mattered when we tried to pack and unpack. However, we were though to sightsee and not enjoy a luxurious room so when you factor in the location and the price, it ws well worth it and we’d stay again if we came back to Tokyo.","Beijing, China","Daniel A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beijing, China</strong>",1401,4.0

Apparently the rule is you only get complimentary water if you stay more than 1 night. Ok so we stayed for 5 nights in total (2 adults in a double bed). But we only get our water on 2nd day after cleaning- how stupid is that rule. If your guests are definitely staying more than 1 night then you should provide water the moment they check in. Who expects to drink only on the 2nd day? And guess what, we only got 1 bottle of water shared between 2 people because only 1 water per bed so pls book twin beds if there’s 2 of you so that you can a bottle of water each. And then shockingly we didn’t get water on our 4th day, which clearly wasn’t written on the information (pls judge it from the attached photo). You only get it on 2nd, 3rd, 5th and some bloody odd numbers they want to make up. APA needs to update this card with more clear instructions. Room:Room is tiny, I kid you not. This is the smallest room I’ve been all my life. Ok for 1 person travelling with only a handcarry but def not with luggage, let alone 2 people with 2 luggages. Room was clean and within Shinjuku but the room size is beyond ridiculous. I would rather pay more and stay at a more decent size hotel. I don’t even understand how the staff can change the sheets. Literally have to hop over luggages to get onto the bed and the only standing spot to change your clothes is where the tiny corridor is which is also entrance to the bathroom. I can’t emphasise enough how small the room is - pls see pictures and you have been warned!Room was also noisy because it was right in red light district filled with karaoke bars. Bed:Bed sinks in the center so it’s uneven and ended up sliding through the slope towards the center so it is damn uncomfortable especially for two people squishing towards the center. Staff:Attitude of staff isn’t to Japanese standard as the guy who delivered towels to our room was very unwilling to and had a bad attitude, even at reception they were not the friendliest. Pro: Public bath is the only plus point for this hotel.And it being in the city but it is not close to Shinjuku station - it’s a 1km walk. I will not be staying here again. ",,melissalL3900NU,3,1.0

I had shipped luggage from Haneda to APA Hotel while we took a 1 night trip to Hakone, and upon arrival and check in at APA, front desk brought out my shipped luggage without me having to inquire.

Also, one of the mornings, the fire alarm rang and woke everyone up, when leaving the room during evacuation we did smell smoke in the central corridor of the hotel.

Not having working wifi is unacceptable. While there is indeed wifi offered, and the signal strength is strong in the rooms, after 6pm when there are guests inside the hotel the speed drops to under 300kpbs indicating that there is a simple bandwidth issue (too many guests, not enough data for them). During the day when most people are outside the speed is fast at 10Mbps+. In order to use wifi during the evening/night you will need to stand downstairs in the lobby which is using a different wifi network.The staff say that no one has ever complained about the wifi speed but that is simply not true if you look at past trip advisor reviews (and for every 1 person reporting the issue on trip advisor there will be hundreds of people who experienced the same issue). The staff did send a person to my room who happily showed me that his phone was able to load a website, however when I tried to explain to him that modern phones automatically switch to the cellular network if the wifi network speed is slower he got visibly agitated at trying to understand my english and left.APA Hotel - please acknowledge you have a wifi issue during the evenings (the first step) when you have guests using your network and fix it. Since your lobby network isn't impacted you probably need to upgrade your router or add an additional line.2) The staff are extraordinarily rude (for the most part)Most Japanese hotels have not yet grasped the concept of customer service, but this hotel has some of the rudest reception staff I've even encountered. This seems particularly so for the night staff. I guess this just isn't a priority but it is a shame considering the majority of the guests who stay here are international tourists.3) The widows don't close properly.You aren't allowed to open the windows at this hotel, and there is no handle to do so. Understandable. However the windows themselves can open - a special tool is required to do so. The problem is that the vast majority of the rooms have not had the window tightly closed leading to a small gap which allows cold air and outside noise in, and there is nothing you can do about it without the special tool. Why don't you go around and firmly close all the windows once and for all and/or replace the window seals?4) You can't control the room temperature.This is a Japanese thing, but in winter you can only turn the heater on or off (you can't even set the temperature of this heater in some rooms) which in summer you can only turn the air conditioning on or off. This means in autumn the rooms are cold (the heater doesn't work) and in spring the rooms are hot (you can't turn the air conditioning on). Why don't you just let your guests control the room to their own liking? The rooms feature standalone heat pump units so there is no technical reason (like central boiler room) why you can't do this.5) The elevators are slow.This hotel has 4 elevators. During checkout time you will likely find yourself stopping at every single floor on the way down - and there are 27 floors. Why don't you have 2 elevators servicing the higher floors and 2 elevators servicing the lower floors during checkout timing? Or program the elevators so they don't stop at every single floor when another elevator just stopped at that floor?6) The staff don't speak English.There is usually 1 or 2 reception staff who can speak 'Japanese hotel check-in English' but nothing more than this. This is surprising considering the hotel location and fact that the overwhelming majority of guests are non-Japanese tourists. Surely it can't be too hard to find potential employees who speak English fluently?Usually with APA chain hotels you get exactly the same thing - it's like the McDonalds of Japanese business hotels. For the most part that is true but unlike other APA hotels this one has wifi that doesn't work, overly rude staff, and considering its location and majority foreign guests its lack of fluent English support is surprising.","Singapore, Singapore","Nickcom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",151,1.0

The cases are just left in main reception right by the main entrance, (Not very secure).Once checked in we went to our room and it was tiny. I know most Tokyo hotel rooms are small as we did stay in another hotel at the beginning of our trip to Japan, (Central Citadenes), but this has been designed for children. The rooms are not big enough for couples at all - especially if traveling with big bags. We were constantly getting in each other’s way and trying to sort out our luggage was a nightmare.And to top things off... No air con! Yes, there is a unit in the room but the cooling function is switched off. We complained at reception just after midnight on our first night and we were given a fan which helped a little but just blew warm air around. We complained again in the morning and they said it’s all centrally controlled working off the air temp outside. So if it’s cold outside then the air con units just blow warm air. And as the rooms are so small and there were 2 of us in there it soon got to a very uncomfortable temperature. As I have a Facilities Management background I know that the units can all be controlled from a central computer but the receptionist was unwilling to help. We asked to speak to the manager but she said there wasn’t one on at the time, we asked when will there be one on duty and she just repeated how the room conditioning worked. We asked again if we could speak to a manager... she then replied she was the manager so that didn’t help. It confused us just as much. Tip: Use the public baths to shower at night because using the shower that’s in your room will only increase the temperature more. The public baths are the only good thing, spotlessly clean and good to relax.The management response I will get to this will go on about how the room is designed for compact use and the air con is part of their eco policy in other words - cost cutting.To sum things up, the hotel is in a great location, handy for the station and seeing Tokyo but the tiny uncomfortable rooms and poor customer service are not worth the trouble. There are so many better places to stay in Tokyo for little price difference. You have been warned.","Lancaster, United Kingdom","djrickparker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lancaster, United Kingdom</strong>",14,1.0

The bathroom is great, crystal clean and has every amenity, included, that you could need (shampoo, hair ties, soap, Q-tips, etc.) I highly recommend spending the additional money and ordering the breakfast. I found finding nearby breakfast a bit difficult and having it downstairs is incredibly convenient. The food is tasty and they have a wide variety of food offerings. I do live in America and for lunch and dinner we eat local foods that I am not used to it is nice to start the day with a breakfast that my body is used to-cereal, eggs, toast.

The rooms are simply to small for 2 people for any period of time and space could have been used in a better manner.So for example we had 2 suitcases and no where to store them. There is no wardrobe to put them in or on. Where if the bed had not gone to within 2 inches of the floor we could have put them under there because the bed base did go to the floor they could not be slid under the bed. Instead of a wardrobe there are two short metal rods sticking out of the wall each containing 4 hangers. The end was missing from one of these meaning that when clothes were on the hangers there was nothing to trap the hangers to the rod and they just slid off. Leaving 2 people 4 useable hangers.There is a really large Tv running most of the width of the bed. Far too large for the room the Tv could have done with being half the size and then some useful shelves could have been placed at the side of it to store items. The Tv only has BBC world service on it for free anyway all other channels need to be purchased.There is a tiny drawer in the desk but that has hotel books and hairdryer in. So basically all clothes etc had to be kept in the cases and then the cases lifted onto the bed each time items were required. The wall coverings were in a slightly tatty condition. And where the carpet met the wall was full of crumbs the entire stay. Bathroom was cleaned nicely though.The air conditioning ran either too warm or too cold and had to be adjusted every few hours.The worst part was that one person had to climb over the other person to get in and out of bed at night as there is only one accessible side to the bed.The rooms were not noisy though. Overall staying here did not ruin our trip to Tokyo but if we ever went again we would not stay again. ,,Millicent W,19,3.0

We lived on the 26th floor (the hotel has 28 floors), and did not want to risk taking the elevator. My family and I encountered three other guests, and we fought open the emergency exit door to go down the stairs outside. The staircase is pretty narrow so everyone lined up to descend the stairs one by one. To some extent it prevented some possible elbowing, but the one-man line makes the descending process a bit long. As we reached closer to the ground, I saw two firefighters exited the hotel from a separate staircase to the hotel restaurant on the second floor. When we reached the ground, I saw fellow hotel guests stood frightened and disheveled in the little plaza in front of the hotel. We were herded right back inside the hotel as the hotel staff said the situation was resolved. Nothing else was said. No explanation or apology was given. After the family trip, I emailed the hotel expressing my concern about the situation and asking for explanation. Due to Tripadvisor restriction on reviews, I cannot post quoted material, so let me rephrase the hotel's response as: We are sorry for the inconvenience, the cause of the fire is unknown. The last two lines of the email reply were even in a smaller font size. No one signed the email. (Knowing a bit about the Japanese work culture, words not in the same font size and no signature in a business letter are just not allowed, not to mention the grammar mistakes) I sincerely do not feel that they took my email seriously. The thing that bothered me the most was not the email nor the attitude, but the way the situation was handled at the start of the incident. The very first thing the hotel staff should do after noticing the fire is activating the fire alarm immediately, NOT AFTER ALL THE EMERGENCY VEHICLES HAVE ARRIVED. This procedural misconduct I have to point out, is unbelievably dumb and scary. Seeing the London apartment fire in the news today, I feel very lucky that the fire I experienced was quickly contained. I hope the hotel could read my comment in a serious manner, and improve their emergency SOP to ensure the safety of their future guests.","Taipei, Taiwan","JRL201706</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",1,1.0

Much smaller than any cruise cabin :). Our bed was against the walls/window on three sides, so I had to climb over. Anyway it didn't prove to be a huge problem and actually gave us many laughs. The room had everything else expected of a good hotel room, including slippers, robe, many bathroom amenities and of course the free Onsen on the top level. Bed was soft and comfortable, pillows too flat for us, but were soon provided with another when asked. Location is excellent. Breakfast was more than enough. A strange thing though was that we didn't read the sign which we'd placed on our door correctly....thinking it was simply a 'make up my room sign', but it turned out to be the opposite, so were surprised when we returned late in the day to find the bed unmade....our fault, though bath towels had been changed and water bottle left.

I believe there is another metro stop close by but I forgot the name, maybe use that metro station if u cone with lots of luggages. Reasons are: Shibuya Jr has NO escalator or elevator for their exit!!! (Not sure about metro). You will need to carry your heavy luggages up and down flights of stairs but thank God there are not too many of them. Then, from the station to APA is an uphill battle.

The red light district isn't that far but you need to keep in mind that is part of Shinjuku, Shinjuku is huge, Shinjuku has a ton of shopping and restaurants as well...so if you aren't looking for the hustle and bustle perhaps you shouldn't stay in Shinjuku altogether.Great fine shopping and restaurant options within walking distance.

Being close to the city's biggest and most trafficked train station, Shinjuku Station, we had no problems with getting around Tokyo, to and from the Narita Airport, and doing some trips outside the city. This hotel is located close to some shady areas; keep in mind that Shinjuku is also host of Tokyo's most famous red light district. But nonetheless, we were never bothered by it and the area is actually quite nice with the big Godzilla themed cinema right next door, the great many small restaurants scattered about (some good, some the opposite of that), the arcades and the many, many lights, all over, brightening every alley and street and flashing in all the colours of the rainbow. The room we stayed in was a double. It just had room for one crammed in bed for two, a small desk, and the tiniest bathroom I've ever seen. Let's just say you could sit on the toilet, wash your hands and have your feet in the bathtub all at the same time, it was so small. But all in all, the room had everything we needed but a hairdryer. In need of a hairdryer then? Take a visit to the traditional Japanese baths at the spa on the 28th floor, where you can both shower and wash yourself, take a scolding bath outside or inside (I recommend the outside tub) and dry your hair. Take note; you're expected to be naked from top to bottom here and there are some strict rules against people with big tattoos, as they'll be thought to belong to the Japanese mafia (Yakuza). We lived on the 25th floor facing west, and the view was magnificent. The breakfast at the hotel was overpriced,we could agree on. It wasn't great and eating out at better places like Le Pain a short walk away was cheaper. The staff was very nice and helpful, always ready to be of assistance.

When I finally did arrive the hotel was clean and staff were very nice, but the room I got was unbelievably small. I could not fully open my carry on luggage easily in the main room but I managed ok. I experienced this once prior in Tokyo, but from the photos online this hotels rooms appeared bigger but sadly were not. I did book a single room but it was barely big enough for a child. Bathroom as well was very tiny and a larger person over 6ft 150lbs+ would have difficulty getting into and using the bath/shower. My main issue with this place was the location. If you are arriving from Shinjuku JR station it's a bit of a hike to get here. It's a good 25 min walk to get here and that's if you know where you are going (which I did). There might be another subway station you can transfer to in order to reduce the transfer time but either way it's not in the heart of Shinjuku. This might not be terrible if you are only heading back to the hotel once at the end of the day otherwise this place is outside the normal tourist zones by 5-10 min walking so its a bit inconvenient. I was only here 1 night so that was not an issue for me. Also be aware this is on the northern edge of the red light district, but it's not a huge deal in Japan and it's very safe. Overall it was well worth what I paid but I don't believe it's in the best location for most tourists unless you can't afford other more convenient locations.

It is also inadequately lit. Bathroom is even smaller, so anyone hoping for some space between the shower & toilet will be disappointed- Toilet did not flush properly - Some questionable literature in the room drawers too promoting Japanese ultranationalist views & revisionist history.

Japanese and western * drugstores ( selling Japanese makeup --my fave!!) in every corner* relatively close to JR stations.

I have no idea why since all my documents where complete. Traveled with my parents and baby nephew and I felt bad that they had to wait for so long. We spent the whole day traveling and were all famished. 2. I wanted to make a reservation at a local restaurant and the front desk absolutely refused to make it for me. I kindly explained that I didn't know how to speak Japanese but she still said no. She spoke good English so I guess she just didn't want to. Imagine if I had to do something more important like let's say God forbids talk to a doctor about an accident. This is the first time I experienced something like this in Japan. Usually even if the Japanese don't understand a word i""m saying they will try to help..no matter what. Even if we have to play charades. 3. We had an early flight so I was in the lobby at 4 am. I rented a pocket wifi and had everything prepared in it's return package and I asked the front desk ( a different person this time) to drop it off at a post box for me. I've rented pocket wifi before and all the other hotels did this task for me. but not APA Hotel.

It is situated at the end of a narrow square that includes restaurants, convenience shops and a multiplex cinema complex complete with Godzilla on the roof.The hotel lobby is the height of opulence with massive chandeliers, marble floors and black and gold paintwork. Reception staff are friendly and helpful, though the checking in process involves entering details into a machine which then produces your keycards.Our room was located on the 25th floor of this 28 storey hotel. Suffice to say, the view over Tokyo was spectacular! Rooms are tiny however and it was difficult for the two of us to manoeuvre around our large suitcases (let alone each other) which we had to live out of for 5 days as there was virtually no storage for clothes.An oversized TV dominated one wall at the foot of our double bed which was predominately set up as a pay-per-view system, the tokens for which could be paid for at the vending machines on each floor. Also within the room was a desk (complete with kettle and plenty of literature on the hotel and surrounding area) and a small fridge. The plastic bathroom we had grown accustomed to during our holiday was well appointed and included toiletries, toothbrushes, razors, hairbands, etc.In order to get a comfortable sleep, I had to ask for additional pillows which were brought to our room after the second request. This really did make a difference so ask at Reception on check-in if you need more than one very thin pillow.Rooms are aligned around an open-to-the-elements atrium which made the corridors cold. Also, if you are worried about heights, and as the corridors are narrow, don't look down!On the 28th floor, there is a spa which includes a communal bath. Males and females are completely separate, but expect to be naked in the bath as my partner soon found out!!! Robes and slippers are provided though to protect your modesty once out of the bath. We didn't investigate the advertised massages as these appeared to be reasonably expensive for not much time. Bearing in mind the hotel location too, we felt the phrase 'massage' could have been a euphemism. For a more forthcoming traveller, perhaps find out and report on Tripadvisor!The restaurant was tasteful and modern but dirty (shelves were covered in dust and fluff) but its staff were very friendly. Breakfast each morning consisted of a reasonable selection of western style cooked food together with an extensive continental buffet. Japanese food was also available including grilled fish, rice and Miso Soup. The downside to breakfast was that the elements of it did not change at all from one day to the next and it was served on compartmentalised plastic trays which we found odd and likened them to those prison food is served in. We chose to eat in the restaurant just one night and was disappointed by the options available and its high costs in comparision to some of the numerous restaurants in the area. We both opted for burgers which were OK, but including two drinks felt that almost £50 was far too expensive. We were also surprised that the restaurant stopped serving food relatively early given that it remained open beyond midnight for drinks.We did like the hotel but on hindsight probably would not return given that there are many, many other hotels in the area - something we did not realise at the time of booking the room in the UK. I guess it goes with the territory that as the hotel was located in the clubland area, you can expect to be regularly accosted by people trying to drum up custom for their clubs at all times of day - this was quite off putting for us naive country types. Word of warning...don't go into a club if you can't afford it! We didn't, but expect to have a massive drinks bill landed on you at the end of the night!!We knew that Tokyo would be full of hustle and bustle and so have no regrets over chosing this hotel, it all contributes to the incredible contrasts that you experience when travelling around Japan.",Northants,"DMFL76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northants</strong>",41,3.0

We stayed for one night as part of a post cruise city break. The hotel is smart and contemporary. Thd location is excellent, right in the heart of Shinjuku which is the neon district. I had read that Shinjuku had s red light district, and I'm sure that there were some bars advertising 'girls' but no more so than Soho area in London etc. I certainly didn't feel unsafe, the area was bustling and packed with interesting bars restaurants and shops (cat cafes, robot restaurants!). The hotel is a 5 minute walk from the main Shinjuku station and 2 minutes from Seibo Shinjuku subway station which makes it really easy to get round Tokyo and see all the sights. There's great nightlife around the hotel to enjoy too.The rooms are absolutely tiny which I believe is to be expected in Tokyo, but as we had 2 large suitcases, there was literally no room to put them and one of them ended up in front of the door which was surely a fire hazard! Aside from the space (or lack of) the hotel was fairly clean and had all the amenities provided. They even had Shiseido toiletries which was a nice surprise! There is a Japanese bath spa on the top floor which looked nice but we didn't use it. The hotel corridors don't seem to be air conditioned but the rooms were, with an added booster box/ fan which we had on all night but it was noisy. To sum it up, I would definitely stay there again or recommend the APA hotel but only for a short stay as it is pretty cramped. If you are staying more than 2 or 3 nights you may want to consider staying somewhere bigger and more luxurious! A tip we would have found useful- don't spend lots on the Narota Express to get back to Narita airport (3100 yen or £24 each). Instead, get the subway from Shinjuku main station to Nippori (Yamanote line) which cost (200 yen each or £1.60) then get the Keisei Limited Express to Narita airport - goes every 20 minutes and costs 1030 yen each or £8 each, takes 75 mins from there to Narita. Overall journey allowing time for finding where you're going takes around 2 hours which is a bit longer than the Narita Express but not by much, and costs £10 each rather than £24. Taxis in Tokyo are very expensive. In the subway, you pay by ticket fare rather than for which destination you are going to, so look on the maps to find your destination and it tells you how much it costs to get there. Easy when you get your head around it!","Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom","sophiebR3772BC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom</strong>",11,3.0

This hotel is a prime location for eccentric travelers, with the Kabukicho always bustling right outside of its doors. Great for walkers and non-walkers alike, it is about a 5 minute walk to Shinjuku station and a 30 minute walk to Shibuya. There is both a 7-eleven and a Family Mart right across the plaza, which both accept foreign cards with a small international fee. That being said, if you are traveling with children I wouldn't recommend staying in Kabukicho, as it is technically the red light district. Granted there aren't nude photos plastered up all over the place, but unless you want to answer a lot of questions from your kids about what a girl cafe is, I wouldn't stay in this particular APA. The rooms are obviously quite small, but you can't expect anything more than a wealthy family's shoe closet when you're paying ~$100 a night. Stretching room is a pricey commodity here in Tokyo. In The double room You can usually open one suitcase on the stand, and leave the second one closed at the foot of the bed. The bed is pretty much the only area pull be able to lay out your suitcase in this room. The room service is fantastic, cleaning every possible speck of dirt in the bathrooms they can find. If you're a victim of The TSA's ridiculous liquid restrictions then fear not, they provide a small tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush for their guests. Leave the toothbrush in the cup provided if you don't want them to throw it out and replace it each day. Razors (with shaving cream), Q-tips, bath sponges, a hair dryer, slippers, yukatas, trousers presses, tea and coffee, and a tea kettle are also provided.The bath spa (I'd call it and onsen but I know there's an intense classification system for onsens that I'm not sure this spa meets) was one of my favorite parts of this hotel. It is a public nude bath, so if you don't want to be rude, you better strip down. People in the bath honestly don't care, and they sometimes will strike up a conversation with you to practice their english. If you're caught hungover after a night at the izakayas, then nothing feels better than sitting in the open air bath in the morning. Just make sure you've washed yourself off sufficiently before entering to spare yourself some judgmental looks. Though is doesn't look like it, The hallway outside of your room is technically outside, which explains the intense humidity and perplexing amount of rain you'll see coming from the ""roof"". Fear not, the rooms are wonderfully air-conditioned to accommodate. All in all, if you're spending your days wandering around the city, then this is a lovely hotel in a convenient location. If you plan on spending a lot of time inside, are claustrophobic, or have any kids, I'd bite it on the premium and stay somewhere larger and more expensive to spare your sanity.",,Marissa B,2,4.0

I don't often write reviews but felt compelled to after finding some of the literature on display in this hotel. Initially I couldn't believe what I came across - after all, this was a well-regarded and reviewed hotel chain. In every APA hotel room, there are books describing extreme right-wing nationalist accounts of historical events with a focus on WWII crimes in China, Korea, etc., either denying, downplaying, or justifying them in the most insensitive and racist manner (I had to stop reading by this point). Aside from the fact that these views are horribly offensive to humanity, the hotel has the audacity to actively perpetuate these views (the books apparently are even on sale at the front desk) and it appears they have largely gotten away with it. I did a quick search on APA hotels and outside of a handful of reviews citing the same thing, it's largely unknown and ignored. It would be as if Chik Fil'A put out sex ed material with their burgers on how premarital and gay sex was wrong. If Chik Fil'A gets backlash for its comments on gay issues, APA (in a similar environment) would be utterly shut down. I get that most people here are on vacation or business, perhaps on a budget or booking at the last minute. I'm also not one that often takes a hard stance on where my money goes (what products not to buy, etc.) but something like this was so egregious and inexcusable that I can't in good conscience stay at or recommend this hotel. I want people to be fully aware of what they'd be supporting by staying at this hotel and decide for themselves whether or not it's acceptable to them.

As the usual check-in time in Japan is 4pm, I've requested for early check in and was still worried as, judging from their slow email reply, I thought they might not meet my special request. Was very happy to know that my room was ready when I got there at 12pm+. What to eat? Try ICHIRAN ramen (the best ramen I've had in Japan), or Coco Curry House (for their non-spicy curry rice). Or if you want cheaper option, there's a Yoshinoya nearby too. This place is highly recommended if you want to have a feel of Tokyo city life.

We liked this hotel for its public bath - we're kinda hooked on them. The room is smaller than the Gracery's. One tip is to request a room with 2 twin beds rather than a double - the room itself is larger to fit them, and they push together. The view was great, very similar to the Gracery's - we were up high in both hotels. The wifi was good. In the daytime, the lobby is crowded with left luggage.To get here, exit through Shinjuku Station's East Exit (yellow signs, also eventually says ""for Kabukicho"") and follow the crowd past the smoking pen. Look for Studio Alta (the big video screen up ahead). On the left side of Alta is a ped-only street. Walk down it to the next light (Yasukuni Dori). There's a Don Quixote store across the street. Cross and continue up to the end of the street and the hotel. Godzilla is obvious on the Hotel Gracery ahead. Turn left when you reach the IMAX theaters, then skirt to the right around the Gracery. Take a left on the sidewalk past the on-street bar area (maybe half a block down). APA Hotel's on the right, past the indoor arcade.The walk here is easy in the morning but gets more and more crowded as the day progresses. There's actually a big shopping mall beneath Shinjuku station and the streets here, called the Subnade, and you'll see entrances to it along Yasukuni Dori. We took advantage of it when we were leaving for the station and it was raining buckets. It connects to the station (goes through a Lumine department store first). Follow the signs.APA Hotel is barely within the Kabuki-cho neighborhood, the historic red light district, but it's more family friendly these days. We took an audio tour of Kabuki-cho one night, just the two of us, and went waaay back into the interior streets, amid love hotels and host and hostess bars and yakuza territory and never once did we feel unsafe. There are people walking around everywhere. Yes, there are prostitutes and shady bars but they had no interest in us. So don't let the location worry you. Just be sensible and don't go into a bar with touts.","Denver, Colorado","Geoviki</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",120,4.0

Tried to ask the desk staff but they speak little English and just pointed to the sign saying 'heating only today'.

The rooms were reasonable and are the size expected for Japan. There are so many food options which was great and a family mart is across from the hotel.We did complain about the speed of the wifi as it was the worst we experienced while in Japan but the language barrier made it difficult for the reception staff the understand. This was the only issue we experience with the hotel. Overall it was a good stay, there is a free public bath available on the 28th floor which was awesome after a long day of walking. If you're after a busy environment, great places to drink and cheap food this is the place to stay.Tips Avoid going with anyone from the street offering good drinking deals or entertainment as these people are usually trying to scam you (and work for the yakuza). Just politely say ""no thanks"" and you will be fine! Go to places to eat that are Japanese only for the best prices. Avoids westerner places as these are generally more expensive.

Easy to find from Shinjuku station, just keep following the direction to Kabukicho and you'll exit at 3-chome, or pass through Subnade to exit at 1-chome (which is closer). Keep a lookout for Hotel Gracery and APA is just around the corner from it.You can deposit your luggage way in advance; and we did for ours a day ahead of our check-in date.Be prepared that the rooms will be small, as is the norm in major cities like Tokyo. It's good enough for rest/sleep since we were out most of the day. Our room was pretty high up so we had a nice view of the city, Godzilla's bust, and the trains coming in and out of Shinjuku station. Bathroom comes with a tub although we mostly used the public onsen on the top floor. There's no safe box though, so keep your passport with you when you're out. 2 dustbins were provided to separate our combustible/non-combustible trash, which is great for recycling.Not all staff speaks English/Mandarin so it's helpful if you know some Japanese phrases.There are 2 magnets for your door: Do not disturb, and Minimal cleaning. I thought the Minimal cleaning magnet was Please Clean My Room because the details were in Japanese so for the first 2 nights only the bathroom and dustbins were cleaned and our towels and slippers were changed. Don't stick anything on your door and they'll clean everything and refill your coffee/tea packs.There was only heated air in all rooms during our stay so it got quite warm and it was difficult to sleep. The cold air mode was disabled so we tried changing it to fan mode but didn't feel much of a difference. Reception advised to use the fan mode, so we told her it didn't work and she must have done something with their systems because it was cooler the next day onward.Artificial onsen on the top floor isn't huge, so if you need lots of personal space like I do, the indoor pool can feel crowded with more than 5/6 people. There's a smaller outdoor pool and a round tub (water feels hotter in the tub to me) and it's nice with the cold winter air. Remember to keep your voice down though, there was a group of 3 almost every time I went and they were super noisy. Shower before getting in only, and not again when leaving.Ask reception for limousine bus info to Haneda airport, but unlike what it says on the flyer, hotel staff aren't able to (or won't??) reserve seats for you. We walked to the ticket counter near the Shinjuku station west exit to get the tickets ourselves without making reservations.The hotel is situated in the red/neon-light district, which is good because lots of eateries close much later (there's a Family Mart opposite the hotel anyway so you can make late night snack runs). But if you look Chinese/Japanese and travel alone or with a partner of the same gender, you might get targeted by the guys standing around trying to pull guests into their host bars. If you're travelling with your other half, ALWAYS hold hands/arms and they won't bother you.There are lots of department stores nearby, plus there's Muji, BIC + Uniqlo, and Kinokuniya, so for 2 mornings we explored them, went back to deposit our shopping then went out again with lighter backpacks. Bring a tote bag to avoid getting lots of paper/plastic bags from cashiers.Drop your key card at the box outside the lift lobby if you didn't have additional charges. If you do, use the white machines adjacent to the reception counter.TIPS:1. Bring a towel from your room if you want to use the onsen as it's not provided there. Would be great if they could though. Wear the black slippers (you get 2 pairs, white and black) there and put them in the shelf at the entrance.2. Bring a cup from your room to the top floor to get ice, because the disposable ones at the ice dispenser isn't refilled regularly.3. Tap your keycard to enter the lift lobby (we saw lots of confused people there). Buttons corresponds to the lift it's next to, so it might be on the 1st floor but it won't open if you tapped your card at another lift. The lift next to the wheelchair-friendly lift is utilised the least because of this, so it's good for getting between your room and the onsen level if you feel weird about getting seen wearing only the robe provided.4. Bathtubs and basin en suite are on a ""countdown"" dial so you can turn it to the amount of water you need while you do something else and it'll stop automatically.","Singapore, Singapore","alyooop</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",5,4.0

Hotel is clean and new.The bad:Size, size, size. From the tiny corridor that just about fits a luggage, to the tiny room itself.The width of the room is the length of the double bed. The bed is pushed right against the window. The wall mounted tv is at the foot of the bed.There's practically no room to open your luggage. Your best bet is to do it on the bed itself.There is no cupboard to hang clothes, save for a small wall pole with 6 hangers. In winter with large coats, it can be a nightmare.If you are 2 people, be prepared to be on top of each other. I was with my husband and we are relatively average sized Asians. For 2 Westerners, I can't imagine how they would move about. Or not.There's a tiny table and chair, but with the limited space, there's no way you can actually sit at the table.I know you are supposed to be out and about seeing the city and won't spend that much time in the hotel room. But having to return to this room after a long day out was... slightly depressing. I stayed at this hotel because I was in Tokyo during the new year and all other hotels were booked out. This was the only reasonably priced place left within walking distance to the station.To be fair, at this price it's hard to complain. But it really is small so I would like to caution other travellers. Either bring smaller or less luggage. And if you are a couple, book the room with 2 twin beds. I'm guessing it might be bigger.One last note - the pillows are flat as can be.

We wanted for nothing; helpful and friendly staff, efficient check in, heating and an air con/blower unit in the room, TV for watching surreal japanese cartoons and sumo wrestling as well as all the bathroom essentials you may have forgotten and extra for the onsen (of course the toilet has all the sprinkler bells and whistles!). The onsen! Immaculately clean with all the instructions a westerner could want to avoid offending anyone. Breakfast was also fab, a perfect mix of western and Japanese buffet which we stocked up on every morning, very tasty.

It was a great deal. Nice, new rooms, clean, and pretty quiet. I would stay here again, but my only consideration would be the neighborhood... The area is kind of wild, and I'm not sure that's what I was looking for. For perspective, we stayed here four nights, and we had a double room on the 18th floor, facing north. GREAT THINGS:-This place was very clean and nice, given the price. Number one, this is a great value hotel! You really get your money's worth. -The bedding and bed were comfortable. -The hotel employees were very nice. The lady that helped us at check in we really great. One snag- a lot of people leave bags and picking them up later was a little time consuming. You may want to consider the lockers outside the hotel, just to the left. -Free WiFi that was really fast and useful. -The restaurant in the hotel is actually pretty great. There aren't a ton of breakfast options within a few blocks of the hotel, so this was handy, and reasonably priced.-The location is really great, if you're looking for the late night craziness of Shinjuku. It's right outside your doorstep, including the Robot Restaurant. -Transit from here is really great, tons of options. Most notably, the Narita Airport Express is at Shinjuku. You can take one train with all you bags and not transfer before you arrive/leave. I liked this, since the stations can be pretty crazy with all your bags (not unsafe, just hectic!). THINGS TO KNOW:-The pillows! I know everyone mentions it, and it's because they're weird. I slept great with them, but it took some getting used to. -The actual train station next to the hotel (Seibu Shinjuku) is a private-line train station that is rather useless. The walk to Shijuku station is several blocks, but that station provides so many transit options, its worth it. I could never figure it out, but it appears there is a way to almost get to the hotel underground from Shinjuku Station, but the station is so crazy, I just stuck with the route I knew to get out. -The hotel is clearly in a late night (aka red light) district. I always felt very safe, but I got hassled to buy massages and ladies several times at night. Its often by men standing in the middle of the street. It was annoying, but not dangerous. Even the people that were out drinking were so well behaved, it was almost funny. -The rooms are very small. I know this is always the case, and I didn't care, but if you're traveling with more than two suitcases, it could be a legitimate challenge to fit in the room, especially if you have large suitcases. We had two carry-on sized bags and backpacks; we were just fine.","Seattle, Washington","MattMarion</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",48,4.0
