I needed a great location close to the office but also close to the action. The Moxy Downtown was perfect for both. The rooms are cool and funky and very minimal, totally my style. When I first arrived on a Thursday night there was a Dj spinning music at the bar, I got to use my free drink coin and it was on. Half way through my stay, I started to feel like I needed a little more room, I had done a lot of shopping and started to run out of room. I mentioned this to the concierge Rachel, and she helped me out. She got me into something just a little bit bigger and it made a world of difference.

Easy walk to Broadway, The Brooklyn Bridge and the Fulton Street subway station. Close to local restaurants and stores. We stayed in room 1101 - King bed with a city view.The Moxy has a cool bar and relaxation area which is always hopping in the evenings! However, the Moxy is one of those chic, hip, no frills hotels so do not expect a refrigerator in your room or a safe or an iron. The rooms also have an interesting window hatch between the bedroom and the shower with a sliding photo that can be used to block the view...but control of the sliding photo is on the bedroom side!(Maybe a problem if you are traveling with kids ) Also, and I’m sure this is the hotels fault, but every time the air came on, you would get a faint smell of weed.

The hotel is located in a good location and it takes less than a minute to get onto the subway. It’s also very close to Wall Street, China Town, Brooklyn Bridge and the World Trade Centre. The property was easy to find and it has a good selection of nearby stores and restaurants. The hotel staff were mostly very good. The luggage porter was excellent and was definitely the most helpful and friendly member of the team. The hotel reception is rather small, but I guess it does the job. The colleague that checked us in was very pleasant and helpful. However, we did drop by the reception on one occasion and the woman behind the desk was very unhelpful, blunt and rather rude.The decor and theme of the property was fitting and rather well done. However it’s most definitely a property for the younger crowd and millennials. The room was really rather small (but this is NYC) and it had a good view. However it did lack some of the amenities that we would have wanted at our fingertips e.g. coffee facilities, but that was most likely poor planning on our behalf. In the room the fan was either on full or auto which is rather annoying, it would be nice to be able to select a continuous low fan. The bed was comfortable however the duvet is incredibly thin, it was much more of a blanket rather than that of a duvet. We did sleep well and on the whole we found the room quiet in a busy city. You have to take two elevators to get between ground level and your room which is rather annoying and a feature of properties that we tend to dislike. It may sound trivial, but having to wait for two elevators in a busy hotel when all you need to do is quickly get to or from your room is pretty annoying. We wouldn’t stay here again but I can appreciate that it’s (Moxy) just isn’t a brand of Marriott for us. Between me and my partner we stay at Marriott hotels around 300 days per year. So we’re very loyal to the brand however this just isn’t for us. The hotel felt much more like a youth hostel than a hotel and that’s not what we wanted.

At a loss, I called back again to check if the reservation was made under the name of the company that hired her. Celine from the Moxy front desk came to the rescue after I gave sufficient information about myself. She said she recognized me as a concerned mother. (Missing person and NYC are not good thoughts in a situation like this....) She went above and beyond normal duty, to see past two errors in the reservation to confirm that my daughter had checked in - with the specific time - as well as her exit time with her friend as they had planned. All precise and descriptive information to give me immediate relief. Oh.

However trendy in a world class city as New York may be prone to high expectations. It might be the price or the brand but, as a general rule, one pays for a hotel to be served; not to be treated as a high school friend. Call the hotel and the message answering is a : Hey! What's up? I should have known better. How in an establishment answers wassup? Then, at check in, they address you by your first name. I've noticed it is a thing nowadays. Hi Bob. Ok Julie. That's cool Rob... But when on Earth we made this a ""cool"" thing? A lady 80 years old is nowadays ""Marie or Gene"" We all have a last name and Sir or Mam is polite enough. ... Unacceptable. Then goes the preposterous offer to not clean up the room every day. Then why pay for a hotel? Must I do my own bed? They try to sell it out under ""environment care"" Really? Then where's the concern when using plastic dishes,cutlery and hundreds of plastic cups? Rooms are little but fine. However they're ageing fast due to... Cleaning! Ambiance is fun but it isn't because you choose Moxy that you appreciate engaging with staff as if they were relatives. I do understand the US has a very relax attitude to social norms. Nonetheless, some deference is expected when you are the client. Chewing gum, texting behind the counter or laughing out loud about the last talk show in front of clients isn't customer service. And if you are a Marriott Bon Voy elite member just forget that you've stayed hundreds of nights to gain your status. Here in Millenial's paradise to be ""elite"" brings nothing. A coupon of 10U$ ro buy you a coffee, no breakfast no upgrades offered... Sorry Moxy but you've misunderstood trendiness with lousiness. Better to advertise as a ""trendy"" Youth Hostel than a member of the Marriott family.","Golden Bay, New Zealand","poloyul</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Golden Bay, New Zealand</strong>",73,2.0

We were given keys to a room but when we entered the room it was already occupied. It was very embarrassing. We returned to the check in desk where no one seemed to know what to do and they were more concerned that someone was in that room than trying to find us an alternative. After half an hour we couldn’t wait any longer for them to sort it as we has a dinner reservation and theatre tickets. They eventually found our luggage we took what we needed and went out. Fast forward 7 hours and we returned to the Moxy only for the self same receptionist, Celine, (at least that’s what her necklace said) to treat us as if she had never seen us before. When I asked ‘have you managed to find us a room ‘ she looked blankly, asked my name and we had to start from the beginning, she explained that she saw a lot of people in a day and didn’t remember us. Now I don’t doubt she checked in lots of people yesterday, but people who are given an occupied room and that you spend 30 minutes with would stick out in your memory, unless it happens frequently, but when I relayed the whole of what had happened she was totally oblivious to any if it. However we duly got an empty room, but I would have thought that a slight upgrade or a bottle of wine, or a complimentary drink at the bar would have been a nice thing for them to do considering the stress and inconvenience they caused us, but no, which is why they are getting this poor review. If they had offered a serious apology then my rating would have been higher to reflect their thoughtfulness, good customer service and attempts to make a horrible experience better. So the room is ok, but the fan is like a subway train approaching and the bed was made with the sheet on top of the blanket (is this a weird NY thing?) so I had to remake the bed. Celine had rattled off something about complimentary water and coffee but didn’t elaborate and we can find nothing in the room clarifying it so a trip to reception will be required to find out what this deal is.

However when 7pm rolls around it turns into a scene with non hotel guests taking over and a DJ playing music. Not sure if this is always the case, but it was for my stay.

I am a frequent traveler, spending over half the year in hotels around the world, including numerous trips to NYC per year and have stayed in dozens of properties in NYC. This one misses the goal in too many ways to count. By far the smallest rooms I’ve had in NYC which are already traditionally small. My upgraded city view I paid for was of the building next door, not the city at all and I paid for higher floor. They are a green property which I can appreciate but that means you don’t get basic hotel amenities like lotion? Come on... I’ve stayed at other “green” properties that can manage to figure that out. Went to the bar for a nightcap, stood there for several minutes because bar tender was too busy staring at her phone making faces then ever look up for those that want to spend money. Finally someone else came by cleaning bar and could see me getting frustrated staring at bar tender and said she would get her attention. Then I give her a card and said leave it open to which her response is “we do last call in 10min”.... ok? So how about “we are gonna call last call soon would you like me to put one More on”, but no her phone was clearly more important. Overall you can see and feel the poor leadership at this property. I’m guessing the GM is in way over their head. I will absolutely never stay here again. You couldn’t pay me to. I’m literally looking at other available hotels for the remainder of the week so I can get out of here tomorrow.

Everything I read suggested Moxy is a fun, funky place that would be a great place to stay with our grandchild. I booked a double queen room and was prepared for a very small room...NYC after all...and few amenities. After a long, laborious, disorganized check-in we finally got out room. Forget those pictures of a neat room with a swing chair...at least if you’re booking a double room. Our room was a sorta double room....actually a one and a half room. Oh, there were two double beds but one was crammed into a corner. The room was dark....ambient light but a broken, absent reading lamp with light for only one side of one bed. Okay...not horrible..Then we turned on the television. Sadly it was not working. I mean really? A hotel engineer tried to fix it...even brought in a new television. Still nothing. Finally we were given a new room. So we packed up and moved out. Our new room was great in comparison. Two beds with access from both sides and 3 working reading lights and voila....the much publicized hanging chair. Our grandchild was delighted...and so were we. By this time it was late...past bedtime for our grandchild...and we got ready for bed. Oh....no top sheets or blankets....just a bottom sheet on each bed. Pretty incredible. Here’s the bottom line: this hotel is clean and its employees are very nice. But, it’s a poorly managed facility with an embarrassing lack of focus and follow up. We made many calls or the front desk and were promised follow-up...most of which ever happened. All and all this is the worst run hotel we’ve ever stayed in....except for one person.

First time here and my room was great, clean, and nicely decorated (updated, hip, modern design with some great added features that you won't find anywhere else). So why the low rating??? They offer a free drink at check in so I went to the bar shortly after checking in (around 4 PM) and was one of 4-5 ppl at the bar at that time...took almost ten minutes for the bartender to come by and of course the free drinks are mostly undesirable (for example, only one beer choice and it's Miller High LIfe...really? That's the best you can do beer-wise??? Okay, whatever it's free...can overlook that for the most part. HOWEVER, not once after that did the bartender or any of the other two bar workers come by and ask if I wanted another drink. Interesting considering it wasn't busy at all and you'd think the reason they offer a free drink is to encourage you to go there and order more in the first place!!! Well, I grew tired of waiting after >30 minutes and ended up going around the corner to another bar where the service was better. Came back to Moxy hotel bar around 6 PM to grab one last drink since their Happy Hour is 5-8 PM. I sat down near the bar itself and after 15-20 minutes I had to literally flag down a server just to place an order. Granted by this time it was getting busy but there were also more workers (2-3 bartenders and several servers working the floor). There was a couple sitting next to me who ordered 5-10 minutes AFTER me yet they got their drinks ten minutes before mine came! How is that? I notice sitting next to me on the other side is a woman who seemed to be part of the management since I noticed several workers coming to her with questions, etc. so I asked if she was part of the bar management--she said she is the director of food and beverage there. As a result, I explained to her that the service was lackluster and left a lot to be desired. I mentioned that last time I came through NY I stayed at the W and their bar service was spot on, as a point of comparison. I'm a Marriott Elite member so I have visited many Marriott properties in addition to many bars in general and the service at this bar ranks among the worst I've experienced. Moreover, all the director of food and beverage had to offer was excuses (new staff, not properly trained, short staffed overall, blah, blah, blah)...NOT ONCE DID SHE OFFER ANY RESOLUTION OPTIONS OR ASK FOR SUGGESTIONS, offer to comp my drink, offer to escalate the complaint, etc, etc. Instead she simply went back to working on her laptop and texting on her phone and completely ignored me the rest of the time I remained there. Unbelievable! I'm a business owner myself and if one of my manager-position employees was this inept at handling customer complaints/issues I would most likely replace them. The fact is, the reason the service sucks so much at the bar is because she obviously sucks at training and sucks at doing her job in the first place. Hence, I cannot fully blame the workers. Won't be back here though, that much I do know. Plenty of other venues that appreciate their customers and offer superior customer service accordingly.","Chicago, Illinois","B307PXdougs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",7,2.0

I love being immersed in this beautiful, historic section of downtown with all the old architecture and cobblestone streets. There are so many views and angles here to photograph, and the Brooklyn Bridge is a short walk, or an even shorter subway or Lyft ride over to the skyline views at Brooklyn Bridge Park. These are the reasons I love this location. As for the The Moxy, it is now my hands-down favorite and top choice hotel in the Financial District! Our room was so adorable and comfortable, modern, sleek – all the nice things. Of course the rooms are small, but so is every single hotel room I've ever stayed in in NYC. The biggest perk of staying here didn't dawn on me until after we moved out of the Moxy and into another hotel in Midtown. We really missed the warm atmosphere of the Moxy Lounge, where we spent a lot of time during our stay due to lots of rain and bad weather. We also travel with our small dog, and we felt comfortable and welcome in the lounge. No one ever gave us the stink-eye, or asked us to leave when we had our pug with us in the morning over coffee, or in the evening during the cocktail hour. The lounge was so comfortable and the vibe was very welcoming and relaxed, and we really missed that once we moved on to a more cold and sterile environment in Midtown. While that Midtown hotel we moved to was nice, we felt trapped in our tiny room during the bad weather, with nowhere to hang out and relax (with or without or dog), and we wished had just booked out entire trip at the Moxy.

In my King room I liked the lighting settings and well thought through flow, spacial assignments of storage and bathroom and in-room essentials. I chatted to a guest in the lift that said it was small but a good example of small living. She was American.

Those who complain about it vs a JW or standard Marriott simply aren’t paying attention. Moxy is a great property if you’re looking for something unique, and fits the local culture of the city that you’re staying in. It is not going to have a super large executive lounge, or business center with 20 computers and printers waiting at your beck and call. But it will offer is a great funky, local, flair, and in my experience in several Moxy properties, amazing customer service.I finished my evening and saw the empty basketball court here at the property and started taking shots. Nobody was nearby by, but quickly one of the staff came and started shooting hoops with me, even though he didn’t have to. We stayed in shot hoops for five minutes, it was really fun and reminded me of my high school days. He didn’t have to do that but he did.

I have never stayed at a Moxy before, but from the street my first impression of the hotel was very positive. The check-in station on the main level was a little small and could only handle one check-in at a time. Luckily, we were checking in after midnight so it was not too busy. Since I am a Gold Elite Marriott Bonvoy member, I had asked about getting a room on a high floor as I initially requested in my reservation. There were four of us in my party, so we had reserved a room with two queen beds. I was told that the two queen bedded rooms were only on the lower floors and I knew that was a lie, but it was too late for me to argue. They assigned us a room on the 6th floor out of 29. You then have to take an elevator to the 3rd floor and go through the lounge to access the room elevators. You need to use your room keys to access these elevators get to your room floor. We had several occasions during our stay where we had to go all the way back downstairs to have our keys re-activated. Another issue was trying to get my mobile key to activate. I can’t count the times I tried, but after the last time I gave up. I could never get the elevator to acknowledge my mobile key. It would work on the room door, but not in the elevator. When we arrived at our room, we freshened up quickly so we could get a late-night bite out. Our sink was draining very slowly and we alerted the front desk when we went out to eat. We knew that it would not get fixed that evening, but they told us that it would be taken care of in the morning. When we left for breakfast we inquired again at the front desk about our sink and they said they knew nothing about it, but it would be fixed while we were out. When we came back in the afternoon it was still not fixed. They said it was on the maintenance list. Again after we came back from dinner we inquired at the front desk before we went up to the room and the manager, Enoch, said that maintenance had been up there but was unable to fix the sink and they would be returning to fix it shortly. In the meantime before we headed up to the room, I displayed my frustration with Enoch and asked about moving to a room on a higher floor as I had initially requested if they could not fix our sink. He told me that those rooms on the higher floors were in “high demand”, but he would see about moving us if they could not fix the sink. I then confirmed with him that there were two queen bedded rooms on the higher floors. When we arrived at our room the maintenance technician had just arrived as well. I asked him about trying to fix the sink earlier and he told us that this was the first time he had been told about our issue and it was the first time that he came up to our room. This was another lie from the front desk. As it turned out, he was able to fix our sink and we had no additional issues with it during our stay. I had requested extra towels and pillows in the Marriott App prior to our arrival, but the request went unanswered. We called and asked for four extra pillows and two extra set of towels. The attendant came after some time and brought two towels and only one pillow. We asked for three additional pillows, but the attendant never came back so we went to bed. Five out of the seven days that we stayed we had problems getting four sets of towels since there were four of us staying in the room. On two different days they actually gave us four bath towels (I’m not sure how that happened), but we never got four of everything without asking and waiting. There was one day where we finally got four washcloths delivered just as we were leaving for the day, but we didn’t have a chance to use them and they were all clean and folded on the shelf above the toilet and when we returned from dinner, they had all been taken. I’m not sure what is going on with housekeeping at this hotel. Do they not know how many people are registered in the room? There were no complaints about the room itself. We knew it would be small and there would be limited storage, but at least it would have been nice if each bed had two drawers underneath. They only had one each. And they only gave us three hangers??? We made do though and lived mainly out of our suitcases. The oversized shower was very nice. The “living room” was nice and we played skee ball on several nights. That was lots of fun. The hours that the living room bar were open were quite sporadic. I can understand if there is no one there and they want to close early, but on two occasions there were many people still there and we were told that the bar was closed. They do not have a business center or even a computer that you can use to access the Internet and print a page out. I found that out at the front desk. At about 7:30 one morning I asked if I could somehow print an email that I needed, but their printer was apparently broken. They said the only thing I could do was wait for their administrative office to open at 8:30. Luckily there is a Staples store nearby and I was able to do that there, but it took me at least fifteen extra minutes of my time that I did not have. The customer service at the front desk leaves a lot to be desired. In my opinion they need much more training on handling issues and the ones that we had were simple ones. This is not a cheap hotel to stay at and I have had better customer service at Fairfield Inns. The location of the hotel is excellent. It’s just a few blocks from the World Trade Center and close to several subway stations. There is an urgent care behind the hotel (that we had to use and it was excellent) as well as two Starbucks nearby and it’s close to many eating establishments. Overall our stay was just average and very disappointing. Had it not been for the lack of communication with housekeeping and maintenance and the spotty customer service at the front desk, we would have rated this hotel very good to excellent as the hotel itself is very unique.","La Quinta, California","GlennW7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Quinta, California</strong>",123,3.0

My only complaint is the coffee. They often run out in the morning and it takes them 30 min to make more. All the staff were friendly except the coffee guy. He was very rude. As far as location, it was perfect for us. It’s 3 min walk to a subway station that runs a lot of trains. Lots of great food in the area where locals eat. I was super nervous about staying at this location, but it’s all relative and ended up being perfect. The bar is great, prices are average and they play music in the evenings with a DJ.

The rooms are of an average size by New York standards however the space is used really well and the beds are super comfy. The reception service is excellent, in particular Destiny who was absolutely fantastic and catered for our every need. She’s a real credit to the hotel and was able to give us lots of local info! The hotel is also pretty new and very clean. The location is perfect for the financial district and allows you to easily access other attractions throughout Manhattan and beyond as there’s a subway stop within a couple of minutes walk. I’d highly recommend staying here. The only constructive feedback we could offer would be the air conditioning being pretty loud and we also found ourself getting frustrated with the extremely poor, painstakingly slow (and at times rude) service we received at the hotel bar. I understand that this establishment is run separately from the hotel- I’d suggest moxy look to get an alternative business to run it (or have Destiny retrain all the staff) as they really let down the rest of the exceptional service we experienced during our time in the hotel.

You check in and are left to fend for yourself. I checked in on a Friday evening, when during fashion week when management should expect traffic and the service was totally awful. For starters no one was answering the phones when we dialed the operator. There was only one person in the first lobby on the first floor and throughout the evening there was NO ONE at the Bonvoy desk in the Recreation bar area. Why have a desk there if there wont be anyone there on arguably the busiest night of the week? Smh. That was not all. We had an ordeal in retrieving water as part of our gold membership. The person downstairs (the one who wouldn't answer the operator line) complained that he was busy helping guests. Why was he alone on such a busy night ? Beyond that he was rude and nonchalant. Offered us some kind of tokens to take upstairs to claim our water. When we got upstairs we were very rudely informed by recreation staff that the two are different entities and they dont honor requests by hotel guests. I can continue but there is no need to recount the frustration encountered that night. It can be easily imagined. Why moxy wont staff a hotel with so many rooms appropriately is beyond me.

Quick to everywhere from Fulton Street metro stop. The room is clean and efficient. The lighting great. A drink token given at check in a nice touch to have a cool drink in the third floor lounge area. The lounge area in general is an inviting space. Cons: Is a little bar of soap too much to ask for? I’m on board with shampoo dispensers instead of little plastic bottles—for environmental reasons (although I kind of miss them). But not even a measly little bar of soap wrapped in paper? Marriott/Moxy has gone to far here. Washing with shampoo/“body wash” not for everyone. The lack of any surface area, not even for a pair of glasses or cup of coffee, in the room ( the folding table was seriously in the way when unfolded. Also while all the pegs for hanging whatever was handy, only three hangers were provided. (There is no closet.) The hanging chair, so very trendy, was not at all comfortable— so basically other than bed, there is nowhere to comfortably sit. There is no refrigerator— so common now, that I forgot to check beforehand. The coffee provided in lounge is awful. Ghastly bitter mud when we tried it a few months ago— this time just weak and bitter. The front desk people are very engaging and trying very hard, but the check in area— industrial chic— is very cramped. And unfortunately one had the feeling that the folks working at the bar in lounge were very very very tired of honoring the nice free drink tokens given at check in. Their begrudging attitude was such a contrast with the friendly front desk people. While having a half basket ball court off the lounge seems so cool— it’s not really when you are trying to “chill” in the lounge and there’s the constant thump thump thump....

When he was trying to explain, they weren't listening. This is when the female associate, my boyfriend didn't get her name, began to laugh and cover her face with a sheet a paper to conceal the laughter. I called downstairs to gain clarity and David informed me ""she wasn't laughing at him. she was laughing at me because I didn't know what I was doing."" THAT'S what you tell guests? Listen, I've been to many hotels around NYC, but this level of unprofessionalism put the worst taste in my mouth. I was so turned off by this behavior.

However, it was on a higher floor (I am a Marriott Titanium) so the view was good.I was concerned with the size of the room. However, since I travelled light on this trip, did not even bring a computer and was there only 1 night, it was OK. For longer trips, I think the biggest problem for me would be the lack of desk/counter top space. The fold-up desk is small, the small nightstand does not even have a clock, etc. There was also no decent chair if you were going to work on that little desk. I think the concept is you go downstairs to work on the computer but that space is noisy, not designed for working on the computer and no privacy. The bathroom is great. Nice sized shower with both on-the-wall and handheld shower heads, nice thick towels and even came with hand-washing liquid soap! Dispensers for dual use shower/hair soap and hair conditioner. No lotion provided. Tiny ironing board and safe under the bed. No sign of any ice bucket.Lighting and blind controls are cool. Bed was comfortable. Staff is friendly.So, I was happy with my stay and would definitely stay here again on quick non-business trips.",United States,"Want2GoHome</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United States</strong>",71,4.0

It is SO noisy I've never experienced anything like it. 2) Lifts - There are lifts from the check-in desk to the lobby. They worked OK. There are 3 lifts from the lobby to the rooms. They are incredibly slow and for whatever reason on the first morning I was there I gave up after waiting for about 10 minutes for a lift that wasn't full and instead elected to walk. The lifts are incredibly slow and I don't think can service the hotel rooms fast enough in busy periods.On the plus side, the breakfast was good except they'd run out of Oat Milk by 7.30am oh and there no room service from what I could tell.I found the whole hotel atmosphere just a little bleak and uninviting.

There are only 2 elevators to service the rooms(there are actually 3 but 1 is a service elevator). Repeatedly and different times during my 4 night stay, I had to wait 5 plus minutes to get an elevator and then stop at nearly every floor up or down. I’ve stayed and many hotels and have not found this experience before...multiple times it took over 10 minutes from when I pushed the call button until I arrived at the lobby...about the time it takes from boarding the subway downtown to reach midtown!Coffee...on day 1, I went to the lobby and being unfamiliar with food/beverage services, went to the bar and asked for a large coffee...the gentleman turned and poured a cup (they were out of lids)and handed me a slip for $3 which I paid and didn’t think any more...until day 2 where I walked up and noticed that there were urns of coffee at the end of the bar self-serve- gratis as being a guest! The location to the subway (Fulton station is right around the corner and the court station is a 5 min walk for other lines) makes getting around easy. Not as many restaurants as Chelsea and Times Square areas and things close up around this location early as it’s very near Wall Street.

Many reviews complain about the size, it is small but the pictures are accurate. The bathroom is a good size. The halls were warm & dark. I am not sure if the halls are air-conditioned. I know that they are going for a nightclub vibe type hotel but (IMO) it's weird and they should light the hallways for safety purposes. The biggest reason for the Poor review is that the air conditioning unit was EXTREMELY LOUD. So loud that I had to turn it off for my daughter to fall asleep but then I had to turn it back on because it's July in NYC & you need air conditioning! Even when the one in your room turns off you can hear the noise for ones in other rooms. Ridiculous! I called the front desk around midnight asking for earplug & got them about 45 minutes later. That was disappointing. They helped some. They need to address the air conditioning issue. Also, the lobby smelled. I could not figure out if it was just from cleaning products & no AC in the lobby or what the smell was but it smelled. Gross. The internet & TV were out for our 24-hour stay & a previous poster said the same. I have never stayed in a hotel that cable was not working. I called and asked & they said that it was being worked on all night & said it should be working but then called & said ...no it's not working yet. It could have helped w tuning out the AC noise or the noise from the street. I know its NYC but on the 22nd floor you don't expect much noise but there was night construction going on & when the AC turned off I had to hear the construction. I asked for a quiet room.

CONS: TV and internet was out the majority of the second day of our stay, absolutely no communication or contact from the staff and of course no offer of any compensation of any sort. Tiny rooms, mostly with little to no view. In addition to all of the other disastrous Marriott changes and they are gutting of Starwood programs and benefits, they're moving completely away from bottled water at any of their locations and during our two-day stay I asked for different people and got four different answers about whether or not the water in the hotel was filtered or not. There are no signs nor communication in any way shape or form. Sometimes elevators are very slow, the food selection is scant at best and cocktails incredibly overpriced. I can't say enough bad things about Marriott's takeover of Starwood despite the expanded brand selection but none of it will ever make up for Marriott's gutting of the Starwood privileges that built the brand.","San Jose del Cabo, Mexico","ehmwww11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose del Cabo, Mexico</strong>",82,1.0

Perhaps the Moxy concept just isn’t for me? I found the rooms to be like glorified college dorm rooms, or a fancy hostel masquerading as a hotel. There’s self check in, which I started to use only because both front desk staff were busy. But then I wasn’t making any progress, a desk agent became available, and instead of offering to check me in, she just shouted instructions to me from across the lobby. The room is small, which is no surprise because it’s New York, but it’s not super functional - corners are cut where they don’t need to be. For example, there is a a wall full of hooks upon entering, and chairs and a luggage holder are hanging from them. There are empty hooks, but no ironing board. The ironing board is under the bed, folded in half. Oh, and it’s a tabletop ironing board, which I’ve not used since college. The table hangs on the walls, you pick it up, and a kickstand drops to hold the tabletop up. It’s a little complicated when an ironing board would fit in the room. Noise in the hallways was a mild issue depending on volume of traffic. There’s no carpet to dampen noise. The city was performing some sort of sewer maintenance until 1 or 2am each night, which for a street-facing room was unacceptable. It felt like I was inside a subwoofer. None of the items I plugged in at night charged, either by USB or regular AC plug. That was a huge inconvenience, but since I wasn’t sleeping well due to street noise, I didn’t oversleep. After one night, I changed rooms. There’s no alarm clock, no apparent guide to the area or the hotel amenities (if they even exist). Nobody said if there was a gym where it was.I’ve never stayed in a hostel, but this is what I’d imagine. The room decor will not age well. The water pressure in the shower was too low, but in the sink it was too high. I won’t be back to another Moxy.

Cool artwork located in rooms and through lobby. USB ports located in outlets throughout the hotel are a nice modern touch. My only real issue here was the water pressure on the 18th floor.

We waited for about 20 minutes for the front desk clerk to return with our bags before we began asking where she had gone as we were going to miss the airline’s checked bag cut-off if she did not hurry up with our bags. We were told at this point that they “could not find” our bags. We grew more and more frantic at this point, largely because we did not want to miss our flight. My husband asked to go down to the luggage room with the staff in order to look for the bags. He searched through both of the two luggage rooms and he did not see them. During this time, the staff kept coming out of the luggage room with suitcases belonging to other hotel guests. Everyone was getting their bags except for us. Knowing that we both had a lot of expensive items in our bags we became extremely suspicious and began getting very angry. We kept asking where our bags were but all the staff would say was “we don’t know” and they did not seem all that concerned to be honest. The assistant manager on duty then came out and went down to the luggage room to help look for the bags. When she did not come back up for another 20+ minutes, my husband asked to go back down to the luggage room again to find out what was going on. They said no, which made us more suspicious. We asked if there was any video surveillance that we could see and were told that the only video would be from the lobby and not in the luggage room itself. This would, however, at least allow us to see if our luggage had come out to the lobby and been provided to another guest (which we already knew was not possible as we had a claim ticket with a claim number and also I don’t think another hotel guest would just take off with 4 pieces of luggage not belonging to them!). Meanwhile, the front desk clerk who I had given the luggage tags to in order to retrieve our bags in the first place never came back up once and was not seen again during the entire ordeal. She also happened to be the employee who checked our bags in the first place. It is our opinion that this employee, whether acting alone or with other employees, intended on stealing our luggage (or specific items contained in our luggage). It was not until my husband became very angry and actually made it known he was on the phone with the police that our bags miraculously appeared, about an hour after we first provided the claim ticket to the front desk clerk. The assistant manager claims the bags were found in a “third luggage room” (they had only ever mentioned there were two luggage rooms during the entire ordeal) and said the bell man must have put them there because there was “no room” in the other two rooms. If this was the case, I highly doubt that they would not have searched this room at the start and I also highly assume that ours would not be the only pieces of luggage in this room. We firmly believe that an employee hid the luggage in this random room with the intention of going through the bags later in the day and taking items of value. The bags would then randomly appear back in the luggage room and the hotel would phone us to let us know they “found” our bags. And when they were returned back to us back in Toronto that is when we would discover our valuable items were missing. The assistant manager even tried to get us to leave to the airport while they continued to “search” for the luggage indicating she would contact us if they were found. She indicated the hotel would cover any costs to us for missing our flight, but our biggest issue was losing our luggage, not the flight. These were our personal items, many with important personal significance and these things cannot be replaced. It seems odd she would even consider this option. We were not leaving there without our luggage! We were very fortunate that our flight ended up being delayed by about 25 minutes. We actually missed the baggage cut-off even with the flight delay and we luckily were able to convince the airline attendant to put our bags through after much negotiation. We have never experienced anything like this in all our years of travelling. I should also mention that another hotel guest I encountered in the lobby during the ordeal told me that her necklace had been stolen from her room. So evidently theft is a common occurrence in this hotel. We certainly will never return. We are extremely disappointed in the way the assistant manager and the other employees handled this situation - they had no concern at all and did not even attempt to show remorse or be helpful. We will be contacting the manager and also intent to escalate things to Marriott. If you are considering staying at this hotel I highly suggest you find another hotel - there are plenty of other great options in the city. This place was nothing but a nightmare come true!","Toronto, Canada","kristenZ1984</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",7,1.0

Beds were comfortable. Room was clean. I liked the cork floors. Motorized window shade was handy. Hallways were quiet. AC worked great. Lighting options ‘relax’ mode was useful. Our bed had reading lights too. Hot shower, with hand held shower wand, a nice touch. Nice towels. Good supply of quality shower gel & hair conditioner in pumps - much better for the environment than those smaller bottles that other hotels give away. Shower had a peep hole - a window that you could cover - which was fun, but it’s not for everyone. We didn’t mind the hanging system, you have to take the stool off the wall to sit on it - for example (also no closet - just hang your clothes on the wall) but we have older relatives who would not liked any of it. It might also be a pain if you have toddlers and you were tired after a long day of travel, but I guess it depends on your level of energy. The mini table folded on to the wall to get out of the way. Rooms are small - as others have said - but we didn’t mind, it was designed well, so it’s functional. Our room had a window that opens to get free air which is rare in hotels and can be a godsend if your room smells bad from food or whatever. I think many of the rooms had windows that open. Our teen loved this hotel. It was hipster heaven. The staff was very nice and overall the hotel had good value.WiFi in room was not strong. Free coffee in the mornings in Recreation bar/hangout on the third level. Recreation bar had drag races one night, a DJ, and a comedy night. We got 2 complimentary drink vouchers when we arrived. As others have mentioned - to get to your room you go up one set of elevators then walk across bar/Recreation then wait for another elevator. Only 2 of the 3 elevators were working but it never was a problem for us. Once you get the second elevator you have to swipe your room key to get to your floor - great for security but sometimes hard to do if you’re holding food etc. For those and other reasons I would say it’s not a great place to stay if you’re older, or if you’re high maintenance, or have mobility issues. Like some of my relatives. They wouldn’t have been able to get out of the hanging chair. But we did see older people there so if you’re spry it’s certainly possible. The hotel might have wheelchair and limited mobility rooms with a different design - we didn’t ask. The main hotel entrance and elevator was wheelchair-friendly. Staff was awesome - helped us print boarding pass, got us car service to airport, all of them were friendly and very knowledgeable. If you’re hungry you must try the Pusilli Panini place - very close to Moxy, giant Italian sandwiches. Read the reviews.Close to Fulton Street subway, 24 Hour CVS, and plenty of restaurants. Thanks so much for everything Jhirette, Noelle, James & Ralph. We would love to stay here again if it doesn’t become too pricy as word gets out - it’s a new hotel, less than a year old.

The bartender grumbled at me and said ""next time get coffee there"", he pointed across the room and walked away. I never saw another place to get coffee and still have no idea what he was pointing at. Literally I could detail 5 different experiences that were just like that. I wish I could say there was one person who was kind or hospitable, but from the check in process to them storing our bags on the way out it was one cranky person after another.

I'm Gold Elite with Marriott, but unfortunately, there were no upgrades available when we checked in. All good, the staff was very kind every time we spoke. We used the drink chips they gave us at check-in on our last night. My prosecco was covered; my fiancé's cider was not. The games were fun. We came in after dinner on Friday night and the DJ was blasting Backstreet Boys. I loved it, my fiancé said in the elevator, ""I am officially too old for this hotel.""Room is small, but I knew what we were signing up for. I LOVED the media system on the TV and how you can either manually sign out of all your services or you'll be signed out at checkout. I mean, loved. I could connect my Spotify to the TV via Bluetooth, watch my Hulu, Netflix, all of it. Well done, Moxy.Loved the location. Easy to catch the subway to everything. There was a Shake Shack just around the corner, along with a Zara. Ubers and Lyfts had a pretty hard time finding us because their GPS kept wanting to drop us off on the opposite side of the block from the hotel entrance (there's only one, on Ann St., but GPS wanted to drop us off on Fulton St.), but I figured out the best way to direct drivers by the 3rd or 4th pickup. It was COOOOLD and windy, but that's to be expected in early February. Loved Brookfield Place a few blocks away!The shower had fine water pressure. Water didn't get nearly hot enough for me, but I also take boiling lava-temperature showers, so few hotels meet this standard. Didn't mind the hooks instead of a closet, was just kind of tough to find places to set our luggage that wasn't the floor. Loved the cool cage chair. Would have liked a nightstand on both sides of the bed, there was only one. I took that one so I could use my CPAP machine.I was so excited to listen to the bedtime stories, but our phone did not work! Couldn't even reach the front desk. Totally dead. But it was never pressing enough to mention to the front desk once we got down there.All in all, my criticisms wouldn't keep me from staying there again if the price was right.

The front desk staff was very polite. John, the engineering on the night shift, is AMAZING and, honestly, saved my opinion of the hotel.The Neutral: The hotel is definitely geared toward a younger crowd. The Bad: The TV and streaming services need work and the WiFi needs to be secure. The hotel is fairly new and the staff seem to need some additional training on the protocols specific to the hotel (like how to get ice). Also, it needs to be much easier to get ice.Longer review:I stayed here for a few days last weekend. I was in town for my best friend's 30th birthday weekend, so we had this whole weekend planned to take the most advantage of our limited time. Check-In: The check-in process was a breeze for me. There was someone else in the lobby who was having issues checking in because of the credit card on file (it was a work trip) and, though he was trying to keep it together, was clearly starting to fray at the edges. The front desk staff didn't falter at all and kept a very pleasant demeanor and tried to fix the problem without adding to the customer's stress.Getting up to the room was tricky (you have to take the elevator in the lobby to the third floor, walk around the edge of the loud and crowded bar/rec area, then take another elevator up to your floor). The room: The room was small, but it's NYC, so that's what I expected. I thought they used the space well. Another reviewer mentioned that there's no iron or board, but I found it in the drawer under the bed.The TV: This was a CHALLENGE. My best friend lives in Canada and he's been waiting to see the new season of the Magicians, which isn't available for streaming in Canada. So, I checked on the hotel website to ensure that I could stream Hulu at the hotel, and it said I could. When I got into my room I could watch Hulu, but I couldn’t use any of the premium features (like Live TV or watch certain shows like the Magicians). I contacted Hulu support and they said it was for one of two reasons: 1. The TV was made before 2016, or 2. The hotel needed to update the Hulu app. And thus, began a many-houred saga of trying to fix this issue.I called down to the front desk. They said that, since the hotel is only around 6 months old, the TV was new, so they would send up an engineer to look at it. The engineer from the night shift (a man named John with the patience of a saint and excellent customer service) came up and, after hearing the issue, informed me that they contract with an outside company for TV software and app maintenance. Long story short, hours later, he had had that company reset and update my TV 3 times with no luck. We tried Chrome Casting to the TV from my laptop, but there was a HUGE lag between the image and the sound. In the end, I just ended up buying the episodes from YouTube and watching it on the YouTube app on the TV, but I shouldn't have had to. I also should not have had to go through the saga to begin with. I know this is a new place and they're still ironing out the kinks, so I'm giving them a bit of a pass on not knowing about this, but I hope they are more aware in the future.The ICE: As John and I spent a while together trying to fix my TV, we chatted. So, he found out I had just had a minor outpatient ortho procedure earlier in the day. He asked if I wanted some ice. I had honestly been so distracted by trying to get things set up for my friend's bday celebration, I hadn't even noticed how much pain I was in, or that there were no ice buckets in the room. I let him know I would go get it from the machine. Apparently, you have to ORDER ice at this hotel. There is not an ice machine on the floor or one accessible to guests. John, again, cannot say enough good things about him, got me some ice and told me that if I needed more tomorrow or later in my stay I should contact the front desk.The next day, I needed more ice. I called the front desk and they told me I needed to go down to the bar, which I did. I then stood there for a while without being helped, despite trying to wave someone down. I guess it was my mistake wearing my PJs down to the bar instead of something more hip *sigh*. I finally got someone's attention and he told me that I needed to call the front desk, which I told him I had, and that they should have sent some up to my room. He got me ice anyway, but, seriously, getting a bag of ice should not be this hard.",,Jessica L,1,3.0

It was our first experience and there were pro's & con's from our stay. First, the con's: 1. The hotel is located on Ann Street which is very narrow road. The hotel does not have even one designated parking spot in front of the entrance for off-loading your luggage so the choices are to either double park & hold up traffic or drive around the block a few times. 2. You have to take the elevator up to the third floor and then switch to another elevator bank which takes you to your floor. This appears to be set up this way so that you have to walk through the bar & arcade area. It's inconvenient. 3. We were given two tokens when we checked in and were told that each token could be used for a special hotel cocktail at the third floor bar. My wife ordered the special hotel cocktail at the bar and when she presented the token to the bartender, she (the bartender) said the token was only for the smaller version of the drink, not the size she made and that we would have to pay for the drink. I informed her that no one at the front desk told us this and that she should have told us their policy before serving the cocktail. I refused to pay for the drink and the bartender got angry and informed my wife and I that ""she doesn't make the rules"". I didn't pay for the drink. 4. If you are in the mood for a cocktail that is not on their cocktail menu, it will cost you $21.00!!! 5. They serve coffee but no decaf. 6. They spent a lot of money on fancy furnishings in the rooms and other areas however, we had very poor water pressure in our room which made for a disappointing shower. 7. Even though we were on an upper floor (11), the noise level from the Saturday over night construction activities and garbage pickup was high. 8. There is only one thin pillow provided per person. Now, the Pro's: 1. Great location-only a block from the World Trade Center, Trinity Church & City Hall. 2. Great flat screen TV in our room with a good selection of channels. 3. Our room & the hotel was very clean. 4. The service (except for the bartender) was very good.","New York City, New York","Mark S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",72,3.0

As such it does its job very well. Those who gave low reviews for lack of pampering and attention are a bit unfair because it doesn't claim to be a JW Marriott. We are at least 10 years away from passing for millenials but really enjoyed this place. The rooms are well designed, innovative and fun. Certainly minimalist and on the small side consistent with NYC and then some. We had the deluxe king, assumedly the largest room in the place and I would say it was barely 150-160 s.f. including the tiny box bathroom. Not a problem for us but if you are a family or if that bothers you, look elsewhere. The fit and finish of the room was not bad, nice beds and bedding, fun swing (though a tight squeeze if you are tall), good TV and sound, electric blinds, folding chairs, and cork flooring, something I've never seen in a hotel. Lights fairly impossible to figure out, as with many new hotels. HVAC too loud. Bathroom is tight but functional. Bar got loud at times and as noted you do have to traverse it to switch elevators. One elevator was broken while were there, causing annoying delays on the other two. We enjoyed the games and the free signature drink there though and would definitely hang out there more if we were bar people. Breakfast was decent and appreciate the free coffee and interesting herbal teas, though I would suggest that for fourteen bucks they could serve more than one single slice of avocado toast in an order. They gave us the appropriate Marriott status benefits, though limited at Moxy brand. Location is great if you want to be downtown. Staff was friendly and fairly efficient and we experienced none of the checkin or service problems others mentioned. Overall I would say this is a very solid choice, if you are youngish at heart and don't need to be fussed over, don't mind smallish rooms and taking some time to figure out the way things work, and if you can get it for a good price like we did. It is an interesting brand and marketing, and based on the crowds of millenials there, it looks like it is working.",Philadelphia,"gil123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia</strong>",121,4.0

I am a long-term Marriott business traveler who has used many of their different lines for service. For those of you not aware, the Moxy line of hotels is NOT targeted towards business travelers, but my schedule forced me to book this last minute. It is a line that is targeted for millennials, fun and simplicity. Those of you with 5 star, frequent traveler expectations need not stay here. That goes the same for families. Please curb your expectations if you fall into one of these two categories as your bad reviews are a little undeserved. I get that the price point is phenomenal. But, this is meant to be a high end hostel replacement. It’s a place meant for fun, not a high end stay. With that said, here are my thoughts. The pros: The hotel is clean and conveniently located to what seems like every subway line to get uptown (2 blocks away). The lobby is hip and fun with lots to do and a decent tasty food service. It turns into a club vibe by happy hour complete with a DJ, flashy lighting and fun games. I noticed this place was very clean. It looks like they fixed a lot of the “new hotel” kinks where cleaning wasn’t up to par. Both the public spaces (including restrooms), the hallways and the rooms were clean. I was upgraded to a room with a beautiful view. Now for the room, it’s simple, but works. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom has cute details such as a window in the shower (yes, you can close it). There is free HBO and access to your online accounts such as Netflix on the TV. The toiletries were nice. I did not use the gym. I did, however, go down to the bar and the bartenders were nice and helpful to everyone (one even gave the group next to me better recommendations to fine tune their bill). The cons: As mentioned, this isn’t the best hotel for business travelers or families. I noticed a few kids. Don’t bring them here. The downstairs is not appropriate for them, even with the skeeball. It’s basically a club. Working downstairs is great, until Happy Hour when the beat gets pumping. The room has no dresser or closet. KNOW THAT! You will be keeping all your belongings in your suitcase. Not a huge issue as I was done with meetings. But, some may hate it. They provide 2 hangers that attach to the wall. So, you do have a spot for your coat. While the swing is cool, there is just one other foldable chair provided which no one above 120lbs will be able to use. They do not provide lotion. So, bring some. Now for the worst part. The headboard has these attached lamps for reading, night light etc. They are horrible! They are situated so that you will konk your head on them when you sit up. Trust me. You will also smack your face into them when you reach to get your phone if you are trying to charge using the outlets next to the bed. There is no nightstand. So, you’re forced to lay it on the swing or the floor. Floor = hit your head/face. I suffered this injury, unfortunately. I have now tried to file an incident report twice, which leads me to the staff. They have staffed this place with millennials with no attention to customer service. Are they hip and cool looking? Yes. Do they want to HELP you? Depends on when they are done looking at their phone. The front desk is a small stand at the entrance with young individuals. Check-in was painless, but check-out was a melee with two “workers” unprepared to service both incoming and outgoing at once. I called to file an incident report and even then, no one really wanted to help me with the poor front desk guy admitting “I have no clue how to even service a complaint.” After a bit of a hold, the Director did not even want to hear the details of my complaint. She cut me off with the “please email me” response. In conclusion, my stay was fine and I managed to keep my expectations in check knowing who this line is targeting. However, I feel the need to call them out on their customer service. Being hip does not mean you have to forget you are still a Marriott and that customer service is important, no matter who the guest may be.","London, United Kingdom","HotelFashionista</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",89,3.0

It’s only a block away from the Fulton Street station and two blocks from the Freedom Tower. CVS and Starbucks are right around the corner. There’s a Zara at the end of the block. Banks are close as is the Apple Gourmet deli which has great breakfast sandwiches. If you’re easily creeped out by the city you might feel a little unsafe but I’m a native New Yorker and I felt fine walking the streets at night with my friends. Not a sketchy or unsafe area. You also have Aloft hotel one block over and many bars and restaurants within walking distance. We took Lyft to Morton’s Steahouse because it wa Restaurant Wee. The food is incredible but the service horrendous. Our room was a decent size. It’s what I expect every year we visit the city. I love the concept of pegs on the wall and minimal furniture. If you open the drawer under the bed you’ll find an iron and foldable ironing board. There’s a robe in the room as well. There’s only one pillow so request more right away If that’s a problem for you. Housekeeping service may be slow when you call down. Bring your streaming device if you want to watch your shows or simply sign in on the tv and you have the option to erase your private data before you check out. The entry to the hotel is nothing spectacular unfortunately. The Times Square location is more impressive. But the staff are very friendly and welcoming and helpful. You go up the elevator to the third floor then go right and make a left to go to the next set of elevators that take you to your room. Very simple but I know some may complain. The basketball court is so cool and was well used by our husbands. The bar Recreation is a cool concept but during our stay there very boring and quiet. Even the DJ didn’t play great music to encourage dancing. That was disappointing. We got a free drink token and had the signature drink. It had some grapefruit flavor. It wasn’t bad at all. Don’t come to this hotel expecting your typical Marriott stay. It doesn’t have room service, closets, free breakfast, etc. but it was more than sufficient for us to stay and have a great time. Beds are comfy and view was great. I would return.","New Brunswick, New Jersey","missmarie723</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Brunswick, New Jersey</strong>",13,5.0

But then when I noticed the switches near the bed that control different styles of lighting and an automatic window shade - not to mention that the old fashioned rotary phone was really push buttons (with a button in the middle that says ""Bedtime Stories"") did things start to change.

From the Moxy Advertisement that pops up on the TV at blasting volume when turned on, it seems the Moxy is being offered as a place to LET LOOSE!, BE CRAZY!, PARTY! Sounds like they are asking for the rooms to get trashed. Maybe that's why the rooms look like they are decorated on a budget. In the trend of Ian Schrager hotels, the room has a very small footprint with hyper-stylized but poorly functioning or ill considered furnishings. The bed is comfortable enough, but the clearance between the foot of the bed and the wall is about 1.5 feet. In this space, against the wall is a folding table. This table is essentially useless. You can't sit at it, it's hard to eat off of, if it's down you can't get past the bed. I tried to iron a shirt, but could not find a board or iron. The front desk informed me that it's tucked under the bed. Unfolded, the ironing board fits nowhere in the room where it's possible to easily iron something, certainly not on the fold out table. I was also puzzled by some wooden objects hanging on the same wall which turned out to be folded stools. Didn't bother trying to sit on one, as there was little space to put it. There is no closet, not dresser or any type of drawer for clothes, oh, and no hangers, only hooks on the wall. There is one mod iron basket like chair hanging on a chain next to the bed. Not comfortable, but maybe the designers thought creative people could use it as a sling, I mean a swing?There is also no room service and no restaurant in the hotel. There is a large 3rd floor space called, RECREATION, where you can play chess, skee ball, get a drink at the bar, or sit and ignore people while you work on your laptop. When enter the hotel, you are going to ask where you check in. It's that little desk to the right where one or two dispassionate staff might be stationed. If you don't want to deal with them, you can do the work and check yourself in at the little computer pads against the window. The most remarkable thing in the 'lobby' is a giant video screen over the elevators that you have to crane your neck up to see, meaning, you can't back up far for a better view, the 'lobby' is very narrow.There are some newish technology features in the room, like recessed LED lighting, an electronic shade, and a bluetooth capable TV, but there is also no ON DEMAND service on the TV. The bathroom is fine.Look, if you are a tourist and plan on spending minimal time in the room, I suppose it's fine. If you are planning on hanging out in the room, I'd suggest somewhere that offers furnishings less reminiscent of IKEA.

My spouse and I are SPG Gold, but we were placed in a room on the 7th floor, meaning they didn't seem to care about our status (first world problems, I know, but what's the point of having status if it's not going to be honored?). My spouse checked in before me, and he let me know via text that teenagers were running the front desk. When I arrived several hours later, I found that to be accurate. Picking up a key from the front desk after my spouse left my name and his room number wasn't an ordeal, but was definitely not the seamless process it would have been at other SPG hotels. (I don't have a ton of experience with Marriott, so maybe it would have been.)The room itself was fine, very minimalist with hooks instead of closets, no safe, etc. The shade in our room was broken, but we told someone about it the next day, and they sort of fixed it--instead of not being able to go down at all, it went down all the way but only came up half way. When I walked into the bathroom, I knew the Moxy was made with white Millennials in mind--there is no lotion. I've stayed at the Aloft and other ""no frills"" hotels, but there's always lotion. Ask any person of color (especially an African-American), and I guarantee you they will say they use lotion every day. This hotel had none, which means they were not thinking about people of color when they created it. Luckily, I bring my own, but it would have been really annoying to have had to go buy some because my hotel was only thinking of white people when they created it. The gym was minimalist, but fine, with some weights and nice, new treadmills and ellipticals, and fitness bands. There's some floor space, so as long as it's not crowded, you can do floor work fairly easily. And there's wipes to sanitize the equipment after you use it, but no trashcan. And there are towels, but no bin for used towels... No frills is one thing, but these things just seemed to be lack of attention to detail. There is a bathroom, so you can throw things away there, but it's unmarked, just a random door, which I didn't know was a bathroom until a worker went in and came out. Oh, and the elevators kept going out. My best guess is someone, maybe a cleaning person, would hold elevator around the 8th floor, thereby sticking it so no one else could use it. There are three elevators for ~30 floors, so each one is needed. Also, when you arrive on the 3rd floor bar/lobby, you'll see a sign to the right that says ""Rooms"" with an arrow pointing to the right. Go in the opposite direction to get to the elevators. In daylight, you'll see that on the other side of that ""Rooms"" sign is the word ""Rest."" I and so many others made the mistake of walking around the floor, only to find the elevators in the opposite direction. For the love of God, Moxy, please change that.Driving home the white Millennial thing, the decor in the bar area is very 80s nostalgic, and the music on weekend nights corresponds, reminding these white 30somethings of their childhood. Lotion aside, I am a Black Millennial who felt pretty out of place as a result, so I'm not inclined to stay at the Moxy again. But I'm sure my white friends would love it, so I'll recommend it to them.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Vonetta Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",23,3.0

However, there were issues with the elevators from the lobby to the guest floors; on a Sunday morning, only one out of three were working. The wait was lengthy, over 10 minutes. More importantly though, this is not a good choice for those who value Marriott Rewards benefits. As a Platinum member, I can overlook a lot of things, but I cherish the 4 PM Guaranteed late checkout. The staff refused to allow it, even when I politely reminded her that it is ""guaranteed."" If you don't want to stick to basic service guarantees, you should just abandon the brand. I'll echo the complaints about construction- it was noisy, and persistent. Eventually that'll be finished, I imagine.","Portland, Oregon","JeffS551</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",10,2.0

It’s also clear that it’s not ready yet for visitors (though it opened earlier this year). Maybe in about 6 months, with a change of management, you might consider it—if you care more about the bar scene than a pleasant stay. On the first of my 5 nights here, I was awoken at 5:45am to knocking. At first I thought it was someone knocking on a door but after it didn't stop for 20 minutes I got dressed and started walking around the hotel to try to find the source.I'm on the 7th floor and went up to the 8th floor, didn't see anyone, so then went down to the 6th floor. Here I encountered one of their employees wandering the hallways trying to find the source as well. Apparently at least a few other guests had complained.This employee told me that they had construction going on many floors up (20th or something?) and that he thought there could be no way the sound was traveling that far. Well, it was, and it must have woken loads of other guests.Besides construction in the middle of the night, they haven’t bothered to clean my room for the past 2 days—even after I double checked my do not disturb sign was NOT on and asked the front desk personnel to clean it on my way out the other afternoon. Where they wrote my room number down, I don’t know, but it never made it to housekeeping. As to the bar, it seems they’re more interested in throwing events here than serving their hotel guests. On Tuesday night they had some Bumble event and actually shut the bar down so no hotel guests could order drinks or food (we tried). On Wednesday or Thursday—can’t remember which—they had some NYU alum event that took over the entire bar. There’s no quiet place to do work at all, and the rooms don’t have an adequate guest chair, so if you’re here for work you’re out of luck. The elevator today (Saturday) was full of discarded construction equipment and wires plugged in that lead nowhere. Took a picture of some of it. Anyway, avoid this place if you can. Note that I also reported the above to Marriott Rewards (I’m doing their Platinum Elite challenge right now) and was told they had spoken to the hotel on Monday and they’d be reaching out to me but it’s Saturday, I just checked out of my dirty room, and haven’t heard a thing.

I am loyal to the Marriott brand because my status is typically recognized and because of the high quality of hotels and service in the brand. I was excited to stay at the Moxy since I heard it was new and a little bit fun and funky. However, the stay thus far has been dysfunctional and a bit irritating. I’m here for one more night and won’t be returning. Few things to call out:Service and helpfulness - When I checked in, there were 4 employees, yet it seemed to take all 4 of them to check in my stay. Nothing about my status was mentioned, nor any amenities of the hotel. Ok.....turned to the elevator and saw there were floors 1,2,3. I noticed that I was on the 13th floor. Would have been nice if somebody to at least mentioned what floor I need to go to in order to find the next set of elevators. Instead, nothing. Nothing about breakfast, meal recommendations, etc. Later that day I asked for a razor. Front desk employee didn’t know where they were and wasn’t sure if they have them. Turns out they did but not until after I already went and purchased one because I didn’t want to make multiple trips and wait for the front desk employee to verify. Called downstairs a little later, but no answer. Seems the phones aren’t being managed. Asked about printing something-apparently the hotel is not setup for printing? Lastly, its almost 4 and my room hasn’t been serviced?Room-I get it in New York hotel rooms are going to be small. But this hotel room is a little bit absurd and there is no chair or no luggage rack. Bathroom is ok surprisingly but no separate fan from light. So it’s quite loud.Not a fan, at all.","Chicago, Illinois","cmj12921</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",13,2.0

The staff was great - very nice and welcoming throughout the stay. From the greeting at check-in to the wait/bar staff in the evening to the breakfast staff the next morning, everyone was super nice and eager to help. Free coffee in the morning was a great plus as well. The property is new (literally just opened) and is still working out some of the kinks. The decor and set up is a bit quirky and hipsterish, but generally works. Room was very small, even by NY standards, but very clean and well put together. There’s no closet (but there are hangers in the room for clothes) and the desk is a fold-away table, but it’s all pretty functional and works just fine. Location is great - right in the middle of downtown and minutes from WTC, multiple subway stops, and lots of restaurants and shopping. Overall a good stay. Will definitely be back.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","D_L_2323</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",11,5.0

But consider this list:Room was dirty on arrival Odd fragrance used as “branding signature” in room and public areasRequest for tissues and toilet paper (!) ignored Trapped in elevator Only lukewarm shower water during morning rush (7am)Request to clean room resulted in a disinfectant odor that took 48 hours to dissipate Staff is inexperiencedDesign sacrifices comfort for styleI would normally overlook some of these but I won’t be back to this property simply because at checkout they didn’t even ask how the stay was. This hotel is a clueless slave to fashion and fails to get the basics right — right from the start. ,Boston,"yobyot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston</strong>",53,2.0

The front desk clerks was friendly and accommodated my request for an early check-in. They also recognized my Elite Marriott Status and provided us with two free drinks vouchers.Hotel is conveniently located in a quiet area, close to numerous subway lines.Our room on the 17th floor was small but efficient. Bed was comfortable.The window blinds and lights worked off an automatic control button next to the bed.Window opens a crack, which was nice.Bathroom size was adequate, but no water pressure in the shower. It took over 15 minutes for the water to get warm/hot. We never ran out of hot water, it just took for ever to get it! With the hotel being new, we appreciated new, soft towels….On the second day, we returned around 9 pm after being out all day to note our room was not made up. When I called the front desk, I was advised they don’t service rooms daily unless you request it. When you’re paying high rates you would expect your room cleaned daily. I wanted to ask the manager if this was the case with all Moxy Hotels, but I forgot.My husband didn’t like the hotel, he thought it was like a college dormitory.I’m on the fence about the Moxy but would return if the price was right!Our Uber ride cost fifty dollars each way. From LGA to the hotel on a Saturday at 1 pm took 35 minutes. Return trip to LGA on a weekday at 4:30 am took 20 minutes.","Montreal, Canada","67avidtraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",10,3.0

Got up to the 3rd floor where I was greeted with fun... adult style. I played skee ball, basketball and ping pong while enjoying the Moxy cocktail and some delicious small bites. A DJ is also available.The room is very cozy and just the right amount of space. The swinging chair (glad it’s bolted) is very comfortable and relaxing to sit in. The bed is comfortable also. Definitely loving Moxy. If you want to get in touch with your inner child, I recommend this property.
