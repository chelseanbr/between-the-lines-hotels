Ocean and mountain view rooms. Excellent comfortable beds. Place is very clean, good sized rooms, water filters to refill your water bottles. Great pool/bar area. Offer activities like aqua aerobics. I would stay that is a 4 star not a 5 star resort compared to other 5 stars around. Be careful when booking as we booked online and then when we got there and checked in had additional charges wuch as resort fee and our bill had other charges were were not aware of that we had to pay. Great resturants, with Morimota Asia amazing for a amazing food and experience. We caught an uber to the airport as it is cheaper than taking the shuttle. Great location, right near beach and the main road. Would stay again. ","Sydney, Australia","Sammy6d</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",57,4.0

The check in process was smooth and informative, the gentlemen that helped us was very kind & understanding (I wish I remembered his name). Everyone was genuinely nice and welcoming every single day! The pool tenders and servers were great and communicative, they provided us local tips on which farmers market to check out, restaurants, bars, hikes, etc. We loved it when they would ask us about our morning and what we got up to it really shows they care. We highly recommend that you upgrade to the longboard club, it’s definitely worth it! This is where we met Zoe and Jonathan Carlton, these two deserve a round of applause in what they do. Top notch customer service and very friendly and easy going people. Excellent communication skills and very attentive.

The room was clean, bed was super comfy, and the view from the balcony was to die for (35 floor with a view of the city and beach). The staff was great. We had everything we needed. Rooms were cleaned regularly. I cannot speak much for the hotel ameneties - I used the infinity pool once. The Oceanarium in the lobby was really neat to see. The location of the hotel is fantastic - it is steps from the beach and is right on Kalakaua Ave. I ate once at Morimoto (second floor of the hotel). I sat on the patio that is overlooking Waikiki beach. I only sampled a few items from the menu and found to be fairly tasty. Parking is expensive (40 usd per day). I found parking close by for much cheaper - for those of you searching for a place to park your car. The Honolulu Zoo does not allow for overnight parking anymore (4 hours max). You can park at the Waikiki Banyan (very close to the hotel -approx. 2-3 min walk) 80 usd for a week with in and out privileges. The one problem that I had with the hotel is the amount of homeless wandering around the hotel...The staff need to be more attentive to this. As I was going back to my hotel room on the 35th floor there was a homeless man wandering around the hallway...I have no idea how he got there. It really does not look like a luxury resort when you see this...All in all, I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again in the future.","Toronto, Canada","aleksvuj</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",13,4.0

The down side was that all the hotel amenities were not available. However, the fact that the hotel (and Waikiki in general) was pretty empty, totally made up for it. Considering that Waikiki is usually bustling, social distancing was not an issue this weekend. It was great. The hotel lobby is gorgeous! Designed very beautifully. It also smelled nice. Check in was a snap. Great location right across from beach. The beach area is enclosed and very shallow and calm, making it perfect for people with families.The room was great. We booked an Ocean View room (located on the Beachside section of the hotel) with two queen beds. It was pretty much what we expected. The beds were comfortable. A little lumpy, but comfortable. The view was amazing. Great view of the ocean and Waikiki beach (looking toward the Royal Hawaiian). On many of the reviews I've read, a complaint was the size of the bathroom. I do agree that it's pretty small, it wasn't really an issue. The smart toilet and rain shower is great, though. The shining star of the property was the pool. I loved it. Especially since it was never really crowded. I hear that it's usually pretty busy, but thankfully we avoided all that. It provided a backdrop for a lot of nice photographs. Pretty much lounged around the area for most of the day. It was an awesome way to spend my birthday. Considering it was a really slow period and everything going on, interaction with hotel staff was very minimal. But the little that I did have was pleasant. Overall it was a great stay and I really enjoyed the hotel. I will say that I was disappointed not to be able to enjoy everything that the hotel had to offer, especially considering it's what we're paying for. However, it's a tough time right now so I understand. Would definitely consider staying at the Alohilani once again when everything blows over (and if there's good deals, hehe).","Wahiawa, Hawaii","jkaleikilo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wahiawa, Hawaii</strong>",8,4.0

The location is across the street from the beach. Our reason for choosing this particular hotel was due to all the amenities they offered. Unfortunately, everything started closing down or was canceled due to the coronavirus! I was looking forwars to the lei making....canceled. The baracuda restaurant, canceled. Yoga on rooftop...canceled...canceled...CANCELED! I mean dern it virus! I know it was out of THEIR control but, we definitely did NOT get what was paid for. I will NOT be coming back here to this hotel. I've stayed in much better hotels. On the brighy side, the infinity pool was beautiful but, the jacuzzi was dirty. The kids were splashing and diving even though 'NO DIVING' was allowed. The Longboard staff was super friendly! They don't have a lot of options though. I did love the acai bowl...yum! An omlette bar would be a FANTASTIC addition. Some turkey bacon or sausage would be nice, too. The salmon was delish,too. The complimentary shampoo, conditioner and body cream smells super duper nice! The heated toilet seat kinda caught us off guard at first lol! The view is amazing. We didn't get to get massage we wanted. Had to end up walking about 15 mins away to a sketchy looking place to get one. I mean....what more can I say? Glad I was in Hawaii??

We stayed at the Hilton village and wound up moving because we wanted a more adult friendly hotel environment. Management needs, NEEDS to do something about the pool area. Our first day here we tried to get in the pool and it was absolutely overrun with toddlers and children screaming, jumping and splashing in the hot tub and infinity pool. Parents were nowhere in sight and the splashing and screaming became too much so we just went to our rooms. The next day we came back and by 8am the pool and hot tub were full of children. It was also absolutely filthy. Cigarette butts, hair, bandaids, plastic cups floating. I said something to the concierge who were kind enough to knock a day of resort fees off our bill. They have rules posted everywhere about kids under five not being allowed in, children under 13 needing to be supervised, and there’s even a children’s pool but the staff refused to say anything to the parents. I get it, you don’t want to offend parents who are paying an arm and a leg for their vacation. But the pool, which is ultimately why we booked this hotel, was unusable.

Gym had great equipment and well maintained and the pool was small but sufficient. We signed up for the Longboard club primarily for the convenience and would say the value is fair. Longboard club service was excellent with staff being friendly and welcoming. There were sufficient options for breakfast with assortment of pastries, toast, fruit and salad as well as daily miso soup, rice, fixings and proteins. The dinner charcuterie got a little boring after 4 days but the wine cruvinet selections were excellent. Special thank you to Robert who took the time to get to know my favourite drink and his excellent service during our stay. What prevents me from adding the extra star are the little details that didn't get addressed. I had to remind front desk three times (over two days) to remove an unsightly mattress left on our floor by the elevator. Kitchen vents are pointed directly at the cabanas in the Longboard area and the smell of oil was overpowering despite wind direction and we couldn't/didn't want to sit in that area.","Vancouver, Canada","pinapplehanna</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",0,4.0

I've been to Honolulu on multiple occasions but our experience at 'Alohilani made me never want to stay at another resort, EVERRRR!! And it was all due to the exceptional service provided by every one of the staff there.Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and checked in by Jillian. She was the absolute sweetest and definitely raised the bar of our expectations for our stay!! We arrived earlier than the standard check-in time so our room was not ready yet, but since we had access to the Longboard Club, we we were able to check out the space and hang out for a little bit before our room was available. When we walked into the Longboard Club, there was a staff meeting in progress. We apologized for interrupting but every one of the staff turned and gave us the warmest welcome and genuine smiles all around! Seriously, so sweet!! We also went to check out the gym where again, we were greeted by the most friendly staff, including Dave, the manager. We were quite impressed by the equipment available there....full squat rack and other machines you normally don't see at hotel gyms.Once our room was ready, we went up and got settled in. The room is not huge but it was more than comfortable. The decor is clean, elegant, and calming like the rest of the hotel. The full wall of glass gave us an unobstructed view of the ocean ~~ heart eyes ^ a million. It was such a treat sleeping with the sliding glass door open and falling asleep to the sound of the ocean waves. Later during the day, we went back down to the Longboard Club for their nightly happy hour where we met Jonathan and the rest of the Longboard Club staff. The free flowing wine, beer, charcuterie, and a rotation of snacks/desserts were such a delight. Lounging on their outdoor sofas as the sun set into dusk, while sipping on a flight of wine in front of the gas fireplace was definitely a VIBEEEEE. By far, one of my fav moments of our trip. Jonathan was the BEST! He remembered our favorite selections of wine/beer and brought around refills whenever we were getting low without us even asking! The BEST I tell you! :P We didn't miss the happy hour once during our 4 night stay. The daily breakfast at the Longboard Club was simple but consistently good and satisfying.The housekeeping staff is always on top of getting the rooms cleaned quickly and efficiently. One of the days we had a late start and wanted to relax at the hotel for most of the day. We gave them a half-hour window to clean our room and when we got back....done: new towels, bed made, everything in order. Le sigh~ why can't everyday life be like this? ;)All in all, the BEST EXPERIENCE I've had at ANY hotel or resort. We even decided to extend our trip one more night because we were having such an exceptional time. I seriously can't wait to go back to Oahu just to stay to 'Alohilani again. I truly hope you have a similar experience, and the BIGGEST thank you to all the staff at 'Alohilani for making our trip extraordinary♥","San Francisco, California","MisSarahC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",0,5.0

You have so many different staff members assisting you and checking in on you. Jenny helped us to take our order and was very efficient and friendly. She always checked on us and made sure that we were taken care of. Jones and Andrew were assisting around the pool and made all guests feel welcomed. Jones is so energetic and just a happy go lucky guy. He’s so sweet and friendly! He offered us cookies and grapes and even to clean our sunglasses! Both him and Andrew also went out of their way to get us dry towels and water. All of the staff were on it and took care of our needs.

The area around it is hustling and bustling. Waikiki beach is right across the street. The common area of the hotel is really nice. There is a big fish tank in the lobby, and they conduct fish feedings at 10:30am and 2:30pm daily. It only last about 5 minutes so be sure to arrive early if you want to catch it. There is a daily resort fee and valet fee if you have a car. The extra fees do add up and are charged upon check in. We did not spend too much time at the hotel or in our room since Hawaii is such a beautiful place to explore. Our room was average. It was located right above the Momosan restaurant and we can hear the music playing from the restaurant into the night. The restroom is small but there is a bidet which was cool! We had a partial ocean view, but the view was mostly of the guy sunbathing on his balcony in the condo across the street.One issue we did have was that there was a leak in the closet. We noticed the floor of the closet was damp when we checked in, but we didn't really think much of it being that there is a pool and the beach is right across the street. The closet is located right next to the door and we usually wore shoes or slippers in that area so we did not notice that the floor never dried during our stay. We had thrown a few dirty clothes into the closet throughout the trip and they were soaking wet as well. Luckily we discovered this the day before we left so we were able to put the clothes out on the balcony to dry before having them pack them up. We noticed the ceiling in the closet was soft and there was mold. We called the front desk to let them know of the issue. Since we were checking out, it wasn't a big deal for us. However, we wanted to make sure the hotel was aware of and could address the leak before checking anyone else in. The front desk said they would take off our resort fee and basically waived us off. We also notified housekeeping and maintenance so that the issue can be fixed. We would have hated for someone else to have the same problem or for the ceiling to cave in because of the leak. I'm not sure I would stay at this hotel again. It definitely did not feel like a 5 star hotel. There are plenty of other options in this area and the Alohilani did not stand out as being some place special. But it is a good home base if you can get a good deal.","San Francisco, California","LovesVacay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",39,3.0

We chose the mountain side and the views f Diamond Head were perfect. The Ocean view was ok as we had to look through buildings to see. We were in 17 floor so go higher and your view of both Diamond Head and the Ocean will be stellar. The room was great and clean but wasn’t the most elaborate or special room we have been in. Bathroom and shower were ok, we basically used the room to sleep in and do more mature things after midnight. During daylight we were on the balcony. We spent time at the roof top pool and bar and hot tub. The food at the bar was fantastic. Get Ahi wantons as appetizer. Delicious. The hot tub was crowded. The pool deck was crowded.

In spite of being in peak tourist season and steps away from the beach and busy Waikiki, this resort hotel offers a good vibe during daytime and a quiet ambience at night. A highlight in the lobby is the impressive dual-level Oceanarium that makes other furnishings pale in comparison (though lobby area is tastefully decorated).The room is quite spacious and bright. A good-sized lanai allows for fresh air and ocean breezes. Guest floors seem quiet so sleep quality good. Bathroom area has a wash basin in the open (no door). Shower and toilet are separated (has door) but area for both is too small. It would help at least to have a few hooks to hang towel/clothing in there. Guest service at front desk was generally fine but Nikki deserves special recognition for her friendly and enthusiastic suggestion to us for signing up to access the Longboard Club (LC). Great decision - we really enjoyed LC! Staff there is terrific and helpful. We enjoyed the spaciousness and convenience of food and a fantastic 16-bottle wine Cruvinet and beer on tap crafted for the resort.Swell Pool & Bar with an infinity pool offers a relaxing and fine experience and cabanas can be rented for privacy.

We stayed in a premier ocean front view room, which was a beautiful way to wake up every morning. The housekeeping staff on our floor were nice, especially one man in particular, who would always ask us if we needed anything, every time he'd see us, even from across the hallway!During our stay, the Lunar New Year was being celebrated, and Alohilani offered free food in celebration. We happened upon it by accident, because we normally didn't enter/exit the hotel through the front entrance. It was a great treat, but it would have been nice gesture if there was some kind of newsletter to let guests know this was happening. The only two things that were disappointing:1. The bathroom was tiny in our room. There was hardly any space to dry yourself after a shower. On the website, the premier ocean front view room is described as having a ""spa-like bathroom"". Ours was far from that description, and when you're paying for a luxurious room like that, you'd expect the bathroom to match. 2. One day we went to use the gym facilities and a blonde woman at the desk was very rude to us the moment she saw us walk through the doors. She insinuated that we didn't belong there, but when we showed her our room key, she changed her tone. We should have gotten her name, but we were too dismayed and disappointed by what had just happened. Besides those two things, our stay was comfortable and enjoyable, it great part to Olivia, other helpful staff, and the view of the ocean. We would certainly come back.",,Cuark,0,4.0

I was in contact with the hotel 2 weeks before I actually arrived for my holiday and it was clear to me that the entire Alohilani team wanted me to have an amazing experience during my stay. I also want to state that this focus and attention to customer experience covered the entire team, from the General Manager, through to the events team, the front desk staff, the pool team, bar staff, restaurant staff etc........I stayed at the hotel for 8 days, and everything was perfect. The hotel itself is great and has a boutique feel which is what I was looking for. Additionally the location is perfect in that you are right on Waikiki Beach and so have an easy option of chilling in the infinity pool or taking a walk across the street to the beach or even walking down to the hustle and bustle of downtown; everything is literally on your doorstep.I also had access to the Long Board Club which I would advise everyone to get. This provided me with a little exclusivity as well as breakfast and afternoon snacks and drinks. The real value of the Long Board Club for me though, was the fact that if I wanted some downtime to relax or read my book, then I always had the option of walking across from the infinity pool to the Long Board Club and chilling in a cabana, which was always available. I absolutely loves this hotel and if I go back to Oahu again, I will only stay here!!!Well done Alohilani team..........great work!","London, United Kingdom","Rajan D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",40,5.0

We were on the 8th floor and was high enough to have one of the best views we have had at any hotel. Some of the reviews were confusing to me, if you are in the ocean side building then all the ocean views are great. However its if you are in the second larger building that is offset, behind the one we were in, where views can be restricted. You may want to clarify that when you book. With an oceanview you have to be ok with a little noise with traffic just outside the balcony but for us that’s fine, we are used to it. Both the ramen restaurant and morimoto Asia upstairs were great, the pool is decent during the day and pretty cool in the evenings. Service at check in / check out was good and the room overall was fine, a little small but so is everything in Waikiki. We may stay again later in the year as we really enjoyed the property, but my one complaint is that the bathrooms are small, like uncomfortably small. It’s not that big a deal, its a small portion of your day but its a design flaw to have a bathroom so small, the counter space was ok for both of us, but one person barely fits, and you have to navigate around the door if its open, you you have to keep it closed all the time.","Houston, Texas","HTX2016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",10,5.0

The view from our room was the wall of the next building. A few minutes later, we received a welcome text message asking if our room was satisfactory. I let them know of their booking mistake. The response I got was that they were fully booked and other guests had higher priority (implying they had paid more than we did). I was told to check back the next day, which we did and got the same response - that they were fully booked. I was sorely disappointed that no one from the front desk even gave us a call or offered another option or a quick apology for their mistake.

First of all is location, location, location. The Alohilani is situated exactly where you want to be in Waikiki. You can walk down Kalakaua Blvd. and experience better shopping than Madison Ave. & 5th Ave. in New York City combined. Plus Waikiki lights beautiful gas tiki torches every night along Kalakaua and Kuhio Avenues. Waikiki is super clean and super safe. The city even buffs the sidewalks with a floor buffer at night!!! Due to the high number of Japanese shoppers, shopping in Waikiki is geared toward Japanese shoppers because they are the real big spenders in town. Japanese tourist shop for the experience of shopping and Waikiki does not disappoint. Forget Rodeo Drive and MAnhattan can't hold a candle to the Waikiki shopping experience and the Alohalani is right where you need be located to take it all in. There are many world class restaurant experiences all around the strategically located Resort. The Alohilani Resort also has the best infinity pool in Waikiki and that is saying something because there are 42,000 hotel rooms within a 20 minute walk and countless hotels and pools. The food quality is very high in pool area and very reasonable priced for the quality, outstanding service and over the top views of the ocean over the best infinity pool in Hawaii. Ask to be served by Janice, Kira or Brooke. Sage, a pool attendant is outstanding in providing a world class guest experience by the infinity pool. Niki the pool experience manager is outstanding but was recently promoted. Chico took over the pool and he has some big shoes to fill to catch up to and maintain what Niki built into a ultimate pool experience on the island of Oha'u..The staff at the property is lead by Matthew Grauso, General Manager, a transplant from New City and heads up the best service experience in Waikiki. The front desk, consiger, pool attendants, even the maintenance and housekeeping are all world class. Jillian at the front desk, Rob & Kana in security, Garrett the belman, Chadwick & Wayne the valets will ensure a 5 star experience. Larry in Housekeeping tended to every need and I was quite impressed with several different rooms I have stayed in. A special shout out to a lovely maintenance and cleaning technician named Mario who keeps everything in the lobby and bathroom facilities in tip top shape. Again the location is unbeatable, the views outstanding the staff headed up by Mr. Grauso is outstanding. Mr. Grauso brings the urgency of a New York upbring with the Aloha Spirit!!!! The price points for the rooms are a great value for the location, service, overall experience! The property also has the largest indoor aquarium in Hawaii 270,000 gallons, three stories tall and has all sorts of marine life even sharks to easily see. Twice a day a scuba diver feeds the marine life and that's when you want to roll your video camera or Iphone. It is important to note I had a delicate situation arise and Brain Lauro, Head of security and surveillance was very professional and followed up exactly as he said he would.For dinner no need to leave the property as Morimoto's Japanese restaurant is on property and unparalleled in cuisine and service. Mr. Morimoto is a famous Japanese Iron chef on Japanese TV all the time and quite famous. He often golfs in the day and arrives at the restaurant around 7:00 Pm greeting guests and allowing photo ops. The price points at Morimoto's are outstanding for the highest quality Japanese food on the island with unparalleled service and views of the Pacific ocean featuring indoor and outdoor seating experiences.  I had a massage on site, it looked pricey until I experienced the magical hands of Jenny the Masseuse and it was worth every penny. It also important to point out this property is owned and operated by Highgate out of New York city and opposed to most hotels and resorts in Waikiki having Japanse ownership this is a US firm. That means money spent at the Alohalani stays in the US economy and is not exported to overseas never to be seen again. Highgate owns six properties in Waikiki alone and The VP of Operations for Hawaii is Kelly Sanders and his incredible executive assistant Maila oversea what I think is the best operating entity in Waikiki. I have been traveling to Hawaii since 1975, have over 250 visits, had an office on Bishop Street and built an undersea fiber optic network to the six major islands. My recommendation should carry some weight. All the Best William Karambelas...","Waikiki, Hawaii","TricoastalBill1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waikiki, Hawaii</strong>",0,5.0

There are 2 small unheated swimming pools with a small hot tub between them. The hot tub was so crowded that there must be more skin cells in there than water. As far as I can tell that's all you get for your $50/day resort fee. I guess you get access to the gym too, but every hotel I've ever been to has a gym.5) The gym is a separate business and not run by the hotel. I learned that this means the hotel will not do anything if there is something wrong with the gym. The equipment in the gym is very nice, but there are a number of minor issues (towels not always stocked, routinely out of wipes to clean equipment, etc.). The big issue I had with the gym was that we made a reservation for the tennis courts. We arrived to the gym at the time of our reservation and had to wait 40 minutes for somebody to show up to give us the code to get onto the courts. Then the person was totally unprofessional and unapologetic and then loudly talked to the other person working at the gym about my attitude.6) We were a group of 9 people in 4 rooms. One of our rooms needed to have a day added at the beginning of the reservation. For some reason, we couldn't pay over the phone and we needed to fax (fax in 2020?!?!) in the credit card info. Well, the fax line was always busy so we couldn't fax it. So, we were told to call accounting. Accounting never answered their phones and didn't return any of our messages. Finally was able to talk to a manager who put a note in the reservation. Then when our family arrived from China, they were told they could stay the night (after they paid with cash) but that their reservation would be canceled the next morning without our credit card (we were arriving the next afternoon). It was a total disaster and totally unnecessary.Overall, you can do much better for your money. Unfortunately, we booked our trip very late and our choices were limited.

Although the entrance is grand and the fish tank wonderful, this hotel lacks charm, service and we were incredibly disappointed to have spent as much as we did staying there. Upon check in we were invited to spend an additional $60USD a night to 'upgrade' our room. Thankfully we had already been clued up about this 'upgrade' process from our Uber driver who explained the front desk staff work on commission if they can convince you to upgrade. As such, and because we had already paid a substantial amount of money for the original room rate, we declined. We were placed in a 6th floor room, adjacent to the pool - the noise of the DJ and the pool guests being able to look directly into our room was not what we expected. Neither was the 'partial ocean view', which was directly onto a carpark and neighbouring hotels. Having phoned concierge, we were grateful to be moved to a room on a higher floor, with a much better view - however, we were unsure as to why this room wasn't offered to us from the outset, given it was the same room rate.The pool has its merits, however it is located in a bad position and incredibly windy. The sun is blocked for most of the day by one of the hotel's towers, so you've got better chance of getting a tan and enjoying the sunshine at the beach which, pleasing, is only across the street. The service at the pool is poor. They offer you a menu upon arrival, but seldomly come by to take your order.We were delighted to receive a 'honeymoon' treat in our room from the hotel (although it strangely arrived at the end of our second night) and were grateful for this thoughtful gesture. In addition, the beds are in incredibly comfortable and house keeping did an excellent job to maintain our room each day. However, truly for the money we spent, this hotel was absolutely not worth it. They provide you with a refillable water bottle to save the environment, but then only provide you with paper cups to prepare tea and coffee in your room...we phoned concierge for additional tea and coffee pods one evening and despite two phone calls, they never arrived. The bathrooms, as mentioned in many other reviews, are VERY small. Our general experience was that the staff are not particularly friendly, nor do they appear to be experienced or trained. Our vists to other hotels were far more welcoming and hospitable. It appears that this hotel, still in its infancy, is learning the ropes. It is not worth the inordinate amount of money (room rates, resort fees etc) they charge.We would not stay here again.","Sydney, Australia","georgiemb7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",4,3.0

What I really liked was the ambiance. The decor is minimalist, modern, with big open spaces and chunky furniture. The location was perfect ...buzzing Waikiki but just enough off the beaten path that you had a feeling of escape from the crowds once you got into the glorious massive lobby with its vast openness and cool furnishings. The massive two story aquarium is a sight to behold. On the 5th floor was an infinity pool with cool views of the city and ocean. The service for drinks and yummy food there was on point. The hip style Christmas music was softly playing in the background making hanging out there super nice...We paid for a Diamond Head View Room and got a wonderful bonus of being able to see an expanse of ocean too. From the 34th floor the view was breathtaking. Housekeeping was great. The Longboard Club was great. The staff was great. Overall, we enjoyed our stay immensely and got our money's worth. It was very easy to rent surfboards and boogie boards from two nearby locations. (One on the beach, and one called Moku a block away). And the glorious beaches were a short walk across one street in front of the hotel.

I booked through American Express travel and it was supposed to include a $100 resort credit. At Check-in they had no knowledge of any such credit but in fairness to them they honored it when I showed them the booking reference from AMEX.The lobby and the O-Bar look fabulous and very welcoming but the “fancy” hotel ends there. Had lunch at Momosan and tried to charge to the room but they couldn’t do it for some reason.WiFi was slow, and the pool was FREEZING cold, not very many people in it. It is an “infinity pool” but it’s not really - it’s on the 5th floor, aside from being cold, it’s facing another hotel opposite, so you lose the infinity effect. The hot tub was always full. I called ahead a few days to add my Preferred Hotels membership number to my reservation, but the operator hung up on me and said “we don’t do check-ins over the phone.” I called back immediately and got someone helpful, I thought, but they never did add my membership number. We booked “Ocean View”, not “Partial Ocean View”, and AMEX also includes a free upgrade if available on check-in. When I asked about it, they said the hotel was full but they an “Ocean Front” room but only on 4th floor, but she said she didn’t recommend it. Ocean View is NOT Ocean View - there was no ocean to be seen from inside the room. If you go out to the balcony and look out to the right you get your ocean view between the other buildings blocking the view.The rooms are very old looking inside and don’t have a central A/C system, each room has its own heating/AC fan mounted on the wall. Even on lowest setting it blows hard and it’s just beside the bed so whoever sleeps next to it will get frozen! Housekeeping cleaned daily and did a good job but because the AC blows so hard, it makes the room freezing cold. We set the temperature to 77° during the day and kept it off at night, but every time housekeeping came they reset it to 72° and Hi, so the room was freezing.The Spa is just a gym with a couple of massage rooms, no showers, no sauna or hot tub, no separate pool.In the end, we used Express Check-out and called a few days afterwards, got the front desk or someone helpful, to get an email receipt, but never got it. Will call again!On the plus side, the hotel is in a great location in Waikiki, but it is hugely overpriced for what you get compared to other resorts like Hilton Hawaiian Village.","Mountain View, California","damurfmanindahouse</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mountain View, California</strong>",3,2.0

We booked Ocean view but we got told that they could ""upgrade"" us for $50 a day for Ocean Front. But when we checked into room we found that it was above a very dirty ocean front roof top. We did not spend a day out in balcony as it was ugly view and also stinky from the smoke from homeless sleeping just across the road. When we opened the door to balcony at nights, could not escape the smell of smoke from whatever these people were smoking. It was a waste of 600 Dollars for nothing. It is absolute shocker that the hotel even consider it as an upgrade. Every morning we woke up to the noise of cleaning outside and saw all these junkies loitering about. (for record, the first time I went out with my little son, I had to close his eyes passing the MacDonald close to hotel as there were 4 OD'd junkies getting attended by paramedics).Every day, there was something bad happening just outside the hotel and 4-5 Police cars turning up with the sirens blaring which add to the tension around the place. And we wanted a relaxing holiday. The concierge was a real bad experience. When we were checking in one guy tried to talk us into booking tours and even told us that the others in the concierge desk will charge us far more. Which they promptly did for worthless snorkeling tour. Just do not book any tours through these people. While the reception and bell desk staff were good, the minus is for the concierge experience. The room was good, hence the two stars. The bed was comfortable and the pillows were soft and comfortable, for all the minuses, I must admit they were the best pillows we have ever had in any hotel anywhere in the world.The bathroom was tiny and it was hard even for my 5'9"" , 78kg frame to squeeze out of bathroom door without rubbing against the commode!House keeping was good. The rooms cleaned well and stoked up well. The room had a Coffee/Tea maker. And we asked for a Microwaves to the two rooms and received one for one room after few reminders. The pool was very small and virtually full the whole time and we did not spend anytime at all. The Kids pool was good for our two toddlers.I'm still baffled as to why the extra charge ""Resort Fees"" and other extra charges which add upto almost extra 1/3 of the room rate.","Sydney, Australia","SamWN17</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",25,2.0

What I liked:- Staff was so wonderful- Bed was very nice- Room spotless- Great wines at the Longboard ClubWhat I didn't like:- Oceanfront rooms aren't really oceanfront. There was a busy street under construction between your room and the beach. I guess anyone who had been to Waikiki would have known this, but it was my first time. We couldn't even sit out because it was so loud. - Longboard food is very limited and not very good, and found a hair in my eggs. A couple decent options like the cheese and meats, but otherwise pretty poor, and we had to go out to eat afterwards. Unless you plan to have 4 glasses of wine each for 2 people, the $80 extra per night or whatever it is probably isn't worth it. - Despite having the highest room class aside from suites, the bathroom was TINY. Even if you're used to Manhattan bathrooms. Two people can't use it at the same time unless one is in the shower. I believe they are purposely using a different bathroom photo to make you think it's what you'll get for Oceanfront. There is no closet opposite the mirror as they show on their website- it's like a 5x6' box max, including the shower. Far from relaxing, and definitely not worth the $500 a night, in my opinion. If you get a room on Hotel Tonight or something last minute, and your plans call for Honolulu, then sure. But don't pay $500 a night for an oceanfront room and expect it to a) be truly oceanfront, b) a blissful place to sit out and enjoy serenity, or c) have a bathroom worth the price.","New York City, New York","phillysilver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",104,3.0

I then received an invoice for the extra room it was a non-refundable amount with a no cancellation policy. I paid $aus 455 being the total cost of the room, I was sent a receipt and told the one night would be connected with the 11 nights. When we arrived we are told we only have the 11 night not the 12. after looking the receptionist discovered we had 12 nights, however we owed $50.08 ($aus 72.70) on the room When I asked the question, what are the additional charges for? I was simply told it's just other charges They had actually put the two booking together and called it an “Advanced deposit” so added the additional cost to the non-refundable room as the room price had gone up since we had paid. We were offered early check in for an additional $100 so we said yes. She then said we would be on level 10. I told her we had paid for an up grade to a higher level of 20 above at $15 per night So in reality they were charging us another $100 and then downgrading us, so we waited Paid for partial ocean view and got a fingernail view, nothing like the picture shown in advertising. Bathroom, yes cruise ships are huge compared to this bathroom, but the biggest thing NOT was the toilet. In australia these size toilets are put in our pre-school bathrooms, they were suitable only for 5 and under so low to the ground. In fact the system would fill almost over the edge because the bowl was so small, most of the time you found yourself flushing 1/2 way through your business Most staff were rude, asked the Concierge where the ice machine was, you think I had asked for a million dollars, we only wanted some ice as there was no fridge in room just a cooler One pool attendant was the most horrible, rude person ever who thought he was better, never met such a rude person in my whole life.Everything time you wanted a towel you had to go to the pool level to get it. The first 3 days our room number was taken which is ok but this one was always quite abrupt about it when asking. Then on some of the days when you went to get a towel there was no one there or they would just let you have one with asking for room. On our sixth day when we went into the pool area there was no one at the counter which had become the norm over the past couple couple of days. We put our used towel back and took a clean one and went for a swim in the pool as we were paying $45 resort charges daily to use the pool along with all the other added in charges. When leaving we put our towel back and took a clean one for the next day. There still was no one at the counter. Theb from no where this absolute agro pool attendant came yelling at us, telling us we just couldn’t take a towel we had to be staying there. Well seriously, we are in the pool area it’s a pretty good guess that we are staying there. I said yes we are staying here and gave him our room number, he still kept yelling at us telling us that he was doing his job you just can’t take a towel. I said well there was no one there and we had been staying there for 6 days at that point. He was still being so aggressive I just walked off and he still yelling at us as we are walk down the stairs to the lift. Another pool attendant was laughing really I didn’t think being yell at by an aggressive person was funny. When we get to the lift I said to my husband no that is so rude we have done nothing wrong I’m going get to his name and report him to the  manager. So I went back and politely asked him his name. He wanted to know why and I told him I was going to report him for his rudeness. Well off he goes again, Spitting lava bombs out his mouth. He actually followed us back down to the lift saying we can’t report him he is only doing his job. I said yes but your job is to say, “ what is your room number ma’am” not abuse me and treat us like we are trying to steal a towel. There were people at the lift a Japanese couple who were totally shocked by his behaviour not knowing which way to go just trying to move out his way quickly, they got in the lift. another couple stepped back because they could see how aggressive he was being and like us though he was going to follow us into the lift. We when back to our room, got dress and went to report him. The manager couldn’t be bothered when we asked to speak to him he just sent his assistant. She was understanding and said it was not acceptable behaviour, however nothing was done about his behaviour for two days, as the next day my husband went to get towels and say our room number, this pool attendant puts out his hand in my husband face, seriously. We did got an apology on the Friday with a fruit platter, I think they View the CTV, yet I never went to the pool after that again. This hotel now, people are no longer people they are just $’s and what’s amusing this pool attendant doing his job NOT instead of worrying about people taking a towel back to their room for the next day should be doing something about all the others things that make this pool area horribleStops the drunks drinking in the spa with breakable glasses. Stop them smoking in the spa and pool. Stop people using the pool after 10pm , stop children using the spa these are all rules set up by the pools management yet never kept only one pool attendant in the time we used the pool told some drunks off for smoking in the spaI echo don’t waste your money we paid $6,500 Aus$ to stay for 12 nights the worst decision we ever made, this hotel completely spoil our holiday, in the end we only slept in the badly made bed and made sure we stayed out almost all day, we came for rest and a little bit of luxury and all we got was stress.I agree with other reviews here “budget room” and service at the price of the “ritz” They use to care about people not anymore, give this resort a very wide berth - [ ]","Perth, Australia","Carololeary</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",7,1.0

The lobby was great, check in was good, the facility is good. However, the service and the customer experience was very poor.When we got to our room upon checking in, we found a sheet of what looked like body hair on the bathroom floor, right by the bathtub. It was disturbing, but I just gave it a quick sweep and complained to the customer service. At the time, the front desk said they will waive 1 night of stay, which we were in agreement for.Then, they say that they will change the beddings every 2 nights, and throughout the 4 nights of stay, they did not change it at all. Also, my side of the king bed was sunk in in the middle, so it caused me to have back pain by night 3. We complained about these things upon checking out, and the front desk person did not even apologize but asked if we brought this to their attention earlier. And I did through their text messaging system, but never got any response from them. They did not offer anything for this poor experience. Then, the person also told us that because we booked through a third party (we used Expedia), they can only waive the resort fee, not the whole night stay that they promised before because of the sheet of hair. This really left a poor taste in my mouth and made this trip not as enjoyable as it could have been if the customer care were somewhat up to the standards.The facility and location are above average overall, the customer experience is poor.",,jyryanpark,1,2.0

We had gone out to grab dinner and were headed back to eat it on our balcony when the battery died, so we were stuck with dinner and no room.

Check in went smooth. My room was on the 32nd floor with a view of Diamond Head which was spectacular. I highly recommend this view or the Ocean. The staff were friendly, helpful and responsive. The food was delicious at Longboard Club, the hotels indoor/outdoor guest only venue that serves breakfast , wine in the evening and international cheese and charcuterie selection plus more. I dined one morning at Lychee restaurant where for $40 you get a delicious breakfast buffet. I also dined at Morimoto's, an award winning restaurant located at the hotel. The dinner was outstanding and worth the price. The infinity pool and outdoor lounge are beautiful and a lovely area to lounge, swim and tan. There are day beds, cabanas rentals and fire pits for the evening time. I had a wonderful relaxing day by the pool swimming, lounging and enjoying the pool side bar service. My only suggestion to Alohilani Resort and Hotel is to upgrade their bathrooms. They are on the smaller side with one sink and the bathtub/shower is older and does not reflect the multi million dollars they spent to refurbish and upgrade this property. Other then that the nightly room rate is on par for a 4 * hotel and I would recommend this hotel. The location is great, right across from Waikiki Beach.

The decor is utterly exquisite and it makes you feel great just to be there. However, spite the obvious reasons why this hotel was amazing, non of it compared to the service that I received from two of the employees at Alohilani Resort Waikiki Beach. Renee at the front desk is someone I will never forget. Her service alone was unsurpassed from ANY hotel I have ever stayed at. She made me feel so welcome and as if I belonged. I was staying only for one night to celebrate my daughter’s 16th Birthday and we decided to hotel hop and stay at three different hotels in total. People in Honolulu are extremely pleasant, but there was nothing compared to the care and highly regarded service I received from Renee. I was grateful to have come across Renee at the beginning of my stay as she set the tone for my best expectations of this incredible resort. However, upon my departure I met Nikki Matthew at the pool. Her service, care and regard were mind blowing. I have never felt so welcomed and led to feel peace in my life as we spoke about all my options to find peace and take advantage of all the amenities the resort offered to it’s guest. Between Renee and Nikki Matthews, Alohilani Resort was rated in my option the pinnacle of a five star stay in Waikiki.

I did notice one night that the walls must be quite thin as I could hear the conversation going on in the neighboring room at 2 AM which was irritating.

We left the day after our wedding and had a delayed flight straight away before arriving at 1am in the morning at the Alohilani. Arrival was nothing special at that time of the night and unfortunately we had to change rooms straight away because we had a connecting room. BUT after the first night it was honestly the best honeymoon venue we could have ever asked for. There were two staff members in particular ‘Jillian’ and ‘Daiylin’ who both went FAR above their call of duty to bless my wife and I beyond anything we could have asked for. From restaurant recommendations to personally running half a block after us to give us a travel adaptor so we didn’t have to buy one, to refunding us money for missed breakfasts without us even having to ask, to then hand delivering a written note and bottles of champagne to our room, we were treated like a king and queen by these two!! They truly looked out for us and the quality of staff members in itself is a testament to the allure of the hotel. The greatest testament to the quality of the experience was when their computers went down and we couldn’t check in for our second leg of our honeymoon, so they gave us two complimentary cocktails and free appetisers at the bar! Incredible!! Without rambling about the staff anymore - the hotel is a picturesque paradise. The diamond head view rooms are tremendous, the gym facilities are the best of any hotel I’ve been to (deadlifts and squat racks with free weights!!). They have an indoor aquarium (what a novelty!) and a tonne of activities run by the hotel for their guests. You must sign up for the longboard club where you can have unlimited drinks and nibbles morning and evening.

You are right across the street from the beach, crazy right? You are in the center of all the action.Upon entering this hotel you are greeted by the valet, my man Charlie works the am shift. You will not find a better staff member in regards to customer service, i promise you that. Even though he grabs your car his responsiveness to the guest is more like an ambassador to the hotel and tour guide if you need. Ask him anything and if he doesn't know or can't find it, he will get you the answer when you return.Now enter into this gorgeous 5 star hotel.

I find them all equally as nice, I am somewhat low-maintenance but these rooms are always clean, neat and well kept, i have always been happy.Great pool overlooking the beach, you definitely have to pull up pictures of this resort. Need to check out the ""fishtanks"" at the bar, i will leave it at that, he he.Great restaurants inside the hotel as well, I recommend Morimoto, great frozen beer, yep i said frozen, and the Duck is my favorite.I mean I could go on and on, but come here and see it for yourself, you will not be disappointed. i left so many things out so go on the website.Oh, one very important last thing to mention. They have a little secret club here that a lot of people don't know about. You won't find this in other hotels. It's called the Longboard Club. You do have to pay an upcharge, per day per room, but it is absolutely worth it !!Breakfast is awesome, coffee is crafted in front of you, and in the afternoon they host a happy hour with beer and wine. This is not ok wine, it's Caymus and Prisoner (2 of my favorites) plus others, it's for real. It's a hidden value because you will spend more outside and not eat and drink as well. And you can go in during their off times for light refreshments, coffee and light snacks. Take advantage of this perc you won't find it anywhere else. Also, it has a great lounge to chill and get some work done if you want to get out of your room for a while, just talk to SHADE and she will assist in any way.Matt Grauso is the GM for this property and is killing it !

The property itself is just fantastic. It’s in a great location and basically brand new. The best part for me however is the pool. I think it’s the best pool in Waikiki and I’ve been to almost every single one of them. I like the pool so much for several reasons. First the water is chilled so it’s very refreshing when you get in and it’s never too warm. Also there’s a Jacuzzi and I’ve only seen one other Jacuzzi in Waikiki. Then there’s the food. Everything on the menu is delicious and reasonably priced. To top it all off the service is just over the top. My server was Jenny and she did a fantastic job. Everything she recommended was delicious and reasonably priced. Nikki, the pool manager is also fantastic. She keeps things fun in a really hip yet super relaxed atmosphere. Then there’s Kelly Sanders in charge of everything. His reputation speaks for itself as every hotel he’s been involved with in Waikiki and on the mainland ended up 10 times better than when he first found it. And every time I visit a property that he used to manage the employees there miss him dearly. I highly recommend this property for those reasons.

We booked a room with ocean view and King sized bed. Sadly, the room we booked was not available, and the front desk staff said she’s going to “upgrade” us to another room, which would have 2 queen sized beds, partial sea view and on a higher floor. Well, when we got to our room, it was a pretty nice clean room, with the view of the Diamond head and we still managed to see the ocean as we looked to our right. But we definitely did not see our room being upgraded, if not actually downgraded. Our room was on the 26th floor, the highest floor of the building was 39th if I remembered correctly, and our room was directly facing some other hotel balconies actually, so I didn’t really get the “higher floor” part. We felt a bit disappointed at the hotel’s effort to make up for not fulfilling our requests at all - the King sized bed and ocean view, which are pretty much everything we booked and paid for.And what’s more, the next morning my husband got text messages for 3 credit card payments to the hotel, one is USD 200 something, one is USD 500 something and one is 20 something which we presumed to be the tax. Geez, we were only staying for one night in a basic room, and then charging us USD 700 something? So we went to the front desk to ask, only to find out the hotel wrongly charged us for the price of staying in an upgraded suite: first we did not stay in a suite, second I don’t think our room had been upgraded from my previous description and third, what kind of hotel asks guests to pay for upgrade fees when they cannot offer the room the guests requested in the first place? If my husband did not have that text messaging service, and did not ask for a receipt, we could have just unknowingly left Hawaii with the overcharge. I am sure this did not happen often but somehow it occured to us. Anyway we appreciated the staff who helped us amend the bill and waive our resort amenity fee as a courtesy. Still, Alohilani’s location is excellent, the price is alright for a hotel at the Waikiki beachfront, the room is clean and reasonably spacious. We just felt there were a bit too much hiccups for a one night stay and we had better experiences with its neighbouring resort.","Hong Kong, China","laitinapuiy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",5,3.0

We thought a night in a luxury resort would be a special treat to end the trip. It was just one bad experience after the other and I feel totally ripped off. Maybe I am just not used to the resort lifestyle and was ignorant of what happens in this sort of hotel. I felt bewildered at no information given or any sort of hospitality. It’s like you had to have been there before to know what to do. The manager did take the drinks we had off the bill to apologise, and also the *amenity fee* for the one dip in the pool (which we didn’t realise we had to pay extra for)...On check in, the person greeting us hardly made any eye contact and it was really unwelcoming. I’ve wanted to come to Honolulu and Hawaii for years! It was so rude. The signage was really bad and some signage is just in Japanese with no English at all so wayfinding was really difficult and there was no information in the room about where to go or what time things open/close. Nobody told us about breakfast options, we had to look on the website. We got to our room and yes the bed was a big king size and very comfy. The only good thing. There was a partial view of the ocean in our ‘Ocean View’ room and the bathroom was so basic. Like a Travelodge with an electronic toilet (which didn’t work). Not to mention scolding myself on the shower when I went to turn it off because there was no signage at all and I must have flipped it the wrong way. There were no bath robes, so you have to walk across the lobby to the other tower of the hotel to get to the pool with no robe or fully clothed. I thought there’d be a discreet way to get there without walking past front desk in your costume! I wanted to have a dip in the infinity pool the morning before we had to check out. After trying to find out what time the pool opens (not on the website, no signage on the room floors or elevator, nobody answers at concierge desk) Only to find an aqua fit class with pumping music at 8:30am. It was just so not what we were expecting. Not relaxing luxurious and enjoyable at all. I think they rest on the laurels of the location...I felt like a second class guest and it was not a nice ending to our honeymoon. We didn’t stay for breakfast which was €30 each for continental buffet (with no view).On the other hand, Marimoto restaurant was fantastic and we had great customer service there, and great food.

The bedroom (twin share) was perfect, clean and tidy and large enough for two adults and two kids - albeit ... when you're in Hawaii, I recommend not spending much time in the room! (Besides the kids normally make a mess ... so put your bags in the corner and go and explore Hawaii!)Why? For example, the hotel pool is open to midnight. Have a splash and then jump in the spa until you get too hot and jump back in the pool!In fact, most days at the pool someone comes around to clean your sunglasses for you ... they clean your sunglasses! .... Certainly can't complain about this ... it was the first time in months my glasses where clean!Add in the ice cold hand towels that were given out for a mid afternoon face refreshment or the free cookies or frozen grapes that seemed to magically appear by the pool .. and this tells you about the level of service on offer.Admittedly, we read some other reviews about Alohilani ... and the negative reviews are nothing like we experienced, and actually are quite funny!Sure in our room, like someone else noted, the bathroom door may be close to the toilet - but if you going to Hawaii to study the distance between a bathroom door and a toilet ... you probably should stay at home ... :) There are many other things to do in Hawaii than study bathroom access ... :)Like ... the location of the hotel is perfect ... walk out of the hotel and bang ... you're in the heart of Waikiki. Walk along the beach front shops or it's a short trip to the local shopping centre by trolley or bus. The trolley stop is literally a couple of minute walk ...Admittedly, some of the cabana's in the pool area are for rent ... just go and sit in the ample seating by and around the pool instead - this isn't rocket science! Or sit right next to the cabana in the pool side lounge area which is absolutely free, relaxed and perfect for a bit of relaxation. Even the pool side food is fantastic, flavoursome and well sized to share if you want to.And here's the kicker ... the hotel is also across the road from the beach and a very short walk to all the surf action. We happily carried our hired long boards from the hotel to the beach and the kids were in the surf for hours!Having said all that, with that level of service provided by the hotel and its staff, life is pretty good. The staff should be commended on their level of service and they genuinely appeared to enjoy their jobs and wanted to be helpful.It's Waikiki beach - so there are a lot of hotels ... but this will be high on the list when we return and should absolutely be in your consideration if your staying in Hawaii.Congratulations to the staff and hotel management.",Williamstown,"David M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Williamstown</strong>",0,5.0

You can see a small view of the ocean and you have to go specific corner of the balcony to see it. So again, I told them I booked an ocean view not a partial ocean view? I was told that it’s their ocean view. Seriously? They finally moved me to a floor higher, the room has a better view this time. Their room is small and especially the bathroom! You haven’t thought of sliding door for such tight-space bathroom? The pool area is nice but the pool water is filthy and water is murky. The hot tub is slippery at the bottom.

In all my years of traveling, that has NEVER happened , even in the cheapest hotels we have stayed at.From front desk to pool bar, bellman, etc. All were gracious. Morimoto's is not associated with the hotel , merely is in the same building but I totally recommend Morimoto's Happy Hour....tried all the Happy Hour snacks and drinks.....ono.So, if you visit, use the room safe, go to Morimoto's happy hour, lock up meds and cosmetics.Also read previous reviews of the hotel.

The room is a good size, the AC was cool and we often sat on the balcony and took in the view. A highlight of our stay was the pool manager, Nikki, she was so helpful, professional and friendly. It’s the little things that take this hotel to the next level, the icy towels by the pool, the large pull in area at reception, the water filter stations and the surfboard storage. The best coffee in Waikiki is also at the front door, Kai Coffee. The only cons about this hotel are the exorbitant resort fees and the bed felt a little tired (sunken in a bit).

To get from the hotel to a very narrow and very busy part of the beach, and then behind surf breakers, think salt water pool levels of exitement, requires crossing a three lane road. The police station folks near the beach seems to know some of the more colourful hangers-out by name. Didn’t observe any book ‘em Danos. On arrival there was an excellent street market on. The area is quite noisy so we slept with airco on - set fan to low for silence, it has a degrees C or F choice in terms of temp - and balcony door closed. Minibar was empty, ice machine near the lifts. Bell boy very helpfully filled up ice bucket after dropping off our luggage.Powerpoints easily accessible but the USB ones didn’t seem to provide lotsa juice. (Probably adequate for a mobile phone, if not a digital camera. Our own multi-plug travel powerboard with regular power plug points and USB ports seemed much faster.)Well laid out room. Enough storage. Good sized safe.Simple lighting controls. Comfortable loungey chair inside, table with chairs, and balcony chairs. No hooks or stand for drying beachwear.I can’t remember any issues with Wi-Fi (using Net Analyzer on an iPad fifth gen speed showed as 18.5/ 5.1 Mbps, Speedtest showed 18.9/ 18.5 Mbps, ping 4 ms, jitter fine, service is by SystemMetrics/ “Hawaiian Telecom 2”).Never switched on the TV (no Apple/ Google/ Roku streaming devices or HDMI cable).The facilities appear new and in good condition. Though when they say ocean view, check exactly what is meant. There’s essentially left side, ‘premium’ front and right side ocean view. I’d say ours had about a 60 degrees view so nothing to sneeze at.In our case we got a top floor room facing away from Diamond Head, beautiful sunsets. Having requested a room away from the lifts, we got one right outside the lift unfortunately, no double doors so can hear the lift bell clearly, though no in between rooms noise (could be drowned out by noise outside), despite a mid to late afternoon check in.No bathrobes. Automated throne in bathroom had a non working battery-powered control unit which wasn’t addressed during our five day stay despite leaving a note for housekeeping. Traditional manual flush worked fine, :).The shower pressure/ spray is quite good but makes a bit of a mess. The little ledge for shampoo/ conditioner/ face wash etc is too small. Only one hook for a towel on the back of the door, towel rack too small for towel, face towel, face cloth etc. Housekeeping solid.Pool area on level 5 is very comfortable and connects to the other tower too. Image projections from tower next door on side of tower very Limerocket like. Service friendly and quick. Lobby lounge and bar is unique because of its large aquarium.Restaurant Morimoto Asia - recommended, but tell them if you are enjoying the experience so as not to rush you through - is now part of this complex. Other than that we used local coffee places to refill our keep cups or have breakfast. In terms of food and beverage we picked locations with unimpeded beach views (see hotels below).Concierge seemed to have some untrained folks. (Weeks before arrival email to hotel about best car service or help booking one never got a response.Seriously would AVOID the Roberts Hawaii dot com Yellow ‘Express’ airport to shuttle service recommended on hotel website, for what would be a 30 minute tax ride, took 2.5 hours and they couldn’t find our reservation on two/ three iPads and one Macbook, airco did not work, had luggage in the aisle and they stopped at 4 to 5 hotels along the way, though they did provide a refund, so hopefully this was a one off stuff up.)Usual though pricey valet parking.The Hyatt a street away has a Hertz car rental a level above the ground floor in the arcade, and putting “car rental” into Google Maps showed a variety of others from full service to low coast to exotic. There are quite a few shops on the stretch, or at essentially flash Ana Moana Centre a trolley ride or walk away, and there are a range of outlet malls on the other side of Honolulu (say 20 to 30 minutes drive).There are lotsa activities in the area, including Catamaran sunset cruises right off the beach.Highly recommend Diamond Head walk in the early morning before it gets too busy or hot (even in Sep it was 30+C, walkable or 15 minute drive), and the aviation museum at formerly Barbers Point Naval Air Station/ Jeff Rogers Field (half an hour by car), Pearl Harbour area, Northcoast and Southeast coast (though there seem to be a quite a few people permanently living in campers/ vans/ tents). We stayed at this property after time at Oahu’s Northshore, and then the Big Island of Hawaii. The area has a vast range of accommodation. On this stretch we really like the Halekulani/ LHW (more private, includes the House without a Key) or Moana (busy beach, Banyan Tree, great outlets, excellent service). Overall Alohilani feels more like a 3 to 4 rather than 4 to 5 star so I’d shop around for deals given the wide range of options in the area, and depending on your personal preferences. Between the time we made the booking, prepayment was taken, there then was some confusing email attempt to upsell to a club, allegedly taxes changed on 1 Sep, and so upon arrival there was not just the usual credit card reservation for incidentals, but some further USD160+ amount that reception wasn’t able to explain adequately, let alone provide a prior email warning.

The Longboarders bar is well worth signing up for..... just ask when checking in. Apart from the super comfy beds and well appointed modern rooms the location was absolutely fantastic for us. You are on the edge of the buzz of Waikiki which makes escaping towards Diamond Head area simple. The beaches at this end of town towards Diamond Head are less busy. The hotel has had a major refit so all areas are fantastic. The infinity pool and service around the pool amazing. I would recommend tower 2 which is 1 back from beach road.

Overpriced (and I mean ridiculously overpriced), poor service and generally just a very bad experience. God forbid you ask the staff for assistance or if you had an enquiry. Even before we arrived I should have seen the signs when I emailed the concierge twice with an enquiry regarding parking and never got a reply. Guests were arriving from the UK, Australia and Asia on early flights only to be told your room won’t be ready until 4pm at the earliest. With 300 plus guests arriving over two days perhaps it would be an idea to organise yourselves to accommodate the party a little bit better instead of asking weary travellers to sit around for up to seven hours, many with children. Not to mention when we could check in I was slowly losing the will to live as it took SO LONG. I understand the hotel was recently renovated, though you forgot the elevators. There are four elevators servicing a 30+ story building, we spent half of our time waiting for the lift. There was a general joke around our party “the slowest lift in Waikiki”. On the plus side we did get plenty of exercise using the stairs as it was much quicker. Overall the facilities were average only matched by the very average service. I went to use the gym with my kids only to be told you have to be 16 to use the facility, way to promote yourself as family accommodation. Again, they did get plenty of exercise using the stairs instead. To be fair there were a few positive points, the location is very central, the bed in the room was comfortable and checking out of this horrible hotel was simple.

It is located directly across the road from the main beach. The hotel, although newly renovated and very attractive, was lacking some local Hawaiian atmosphere, artwork, koa wood decorations and Hawaiian music that has brought us back to the islands many times since 1980. However, the hotel's cultural ambassador, Andria Valenzone, is stepping up to the plate to bring back ""what is Hawaii"". Make sure to take one of Andria's cultural tours of the hotel! The housekeeping staff, valet and the front desk staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. We thoroughly enjoyed amazing views of Waikiki Beach and beautiful Hawaiian sunsets from our 17th floor OCEAN VIEW ROOM. In my opinion, this is one of the best views on Waikiki!

We checked in late and were given a room on the 39th floor. The room was extremely noisy (sounded like banging from above). The room was terribly musty and it looked nothing like the photos online. We asked to be moved as the noise from equipment on the roof was overwhelming... We were told there were no king bed rooms remaining. We offered to pay extra for any suite available- whether one bedroom, two bedroom or a pent house so we could sleep together during the anniversary trip. The front desk told us they were sold out and all that was available were rooms with two queen beds (not ideal for an anniversary trip). We took what was available since the noise was overwhelming. We were told it was an upgraded beach view room... We walked in and had a full view of the parking lot facing downtown. No water in sight- even if you head your head off the balcony. We went to bed and could hear our neighbor coughing through the walls. We also heard other neighbours cellphones ringing and around 7am we could here housekeeping starting their cleaning service.

When I drove up yes 5 star the foyer 5 star.Then everything and everybody 3 stars Then I discovered how much we payed 400.00 aus for 5 days (580 uSA) For this price I do except 5 star.When booking in we were told on Saturday the pool is shut from 12 noon for a function which is $ 125.00 uSA to go to Then talking to a family that had been here for a week said it was shut down twice from them and they charge you ammenity fees what a joke for what a closed pool.My family choose this because of the pool as we have a seven month old baby and we could just lay around. So because of this we got breakfast complimentary for all of us. We went this morning it is not that good and am glad I am not paying.Go down the street to a nice cafe with fresh food this is not 5 star to me. Well we had to wait for our room we went to the pool area There are little huts to the side we sat in one as there was no couches or seats left. Then we were asked if we booked it said no can we he said yes to then come over with a book and tell us it is $175 .00 usa a day. We had to move out not paying.Then we ordered food from the bar no one told us we had to come back and get it.A girl came and asked did we want to order anything we said no as we have already 35 mins went past so went up to see why here is all our food sitting on the bar cold as you only get it delivered to you if the waiters order it. There is only one overs on at the bar so they couldn’t come and look for a party of seven in a small area not five star. We spent 148.00 uSA for cold food. Not being happy our son in-law complained the front desk and got a credit,but this shouldn’t happen at a 5 star place.The rooms are okay .If I go 5 star in Melbourne and all the places we have travelled the service is sooo much better we save a year to do this and I am not impressed at all for the 580,00 dollars. You don’t really get anything in your room No tooth brush,no tooth paste ,no shower cap nothing really just the 3basic things .You get a plastic pouch to fill up with cold water but that’s only on the first floor. So far I am not sure how it gets 5 star as it is not to me only the appearance. The family are a bit disappointed in what we have paid and what we have got.If you are spending that sort of money just have a look at other Places as I am not feeling special at this five star. I have stayed a lot at the Novotel chain and I would rate that 5 star compared to this.

Check-in was a delight, as Dailyn not only greeted us with a warm welcome but her positive attitude was very refreshing as most check-ins can typically be robotic, monotonous, and very transactional. Furthermore, upon asking for recommendations around local eats and to-dos, she wrote down a novel (in a good way) for NSEW parts of the island!!! I have NEVER had anyone be so kind and genuine within less than 3 minutes of meeting. And as someone who works with big name clients from a client experience perspective, I am extremely impressed.As far as the hotel goes with service and staff, I found everything to be more than satisfactory. The complaints in some of the other reviews may have some validity but I ask everyone reading this to consider a few things: 1) Views. It’s almost entirely irrelevant what you’re looking at outside your balcony. As long as you’re not looking at anything outright disgusting or inappropriate, you’ll be fine. Get off your high horse and humble yourself. GO OUTSIDE, YOU’RE IN HAWAII!!! 2) Staff sentiment. Having been on both sides of customer experience, your chances of landing a top notch, helpful person is 50/50. Be kind, ASK nicely, smile, and hope for the best. At the end of the day, these folks work hard just like you do and you don’t know what they might be going through in life or that day. They might seemingly live in paradise, but not all that glitters is gold. We’re all human, so we should be more humane. Respect the people and their culture.If you haven’t picked it up by now, let me reiterate that the star of the show here is not the infinity pool (awesome as it is), the aquarium by the bar (very nice to look at), or meeting Miss Hawaii USA (a beautiful soul), it is Dailyn. She set the stage for what has become an unforgettable Hawaii vacay. ‘Alohilani is a wonderful resort on the Waikiki strip, but the aloha spirit that Dailyn shared with my wife and I has been the most surprising delight of our entire stay.Thank you ‘Alohilani, and a very special mahalo to Dailyn!

As we requested a full ocen view our rate was like 500 USD - close to the rates of the grand ladies in 5 star hotelerie in Honolulu. But this is the mosz overpriced hotel stay of my life. The so called 5 star product was far from that ratint (did the pay for it? ) The rooms are ok except bathrooms. They are tiny aven smaller than in any no star Motel. Unacceptable. The decor is done a lot with plastic, even the wood is artificial. The breakfat sevred in windowless mezzanine had charge of 40 USD and not even lattes and espressos or oatmeal orders where included, they were all extra. Couldnt belive it A 5 star product has all this on offer included always. Never seen it different. As we didnt like the breakfast we went to Halekulani Hotel a real high class product only to find that their buffet is 39 USD but the quality and offerings outstanding and of course verything included all served on a beautiful terrec by the ocean. What a difference. I dont know how the Alohilani can be so highly booked, To me its max worth would be 200 USD for a seaview. Seeing the clientele there which was VERY casual and even loud I cant imagine that all these people paid 500 per night. So if it was me who paid and not my friend I woudl have sued for a refund. Unfortunately it was a prepaid booking , if not we woudnt have stayed. i dont understand how all teh positive comments came about.

I'm shocked that I never received a follow up after drafting this list of errors/missteps for them.Here are several things that went wrong while we stayed at the resort for a week: Insult from bellhop – Someone at the bell desk asked from where we traveled from. When we said we came from Oakland, he replied that he was shocked that we hadn’t been shot/killed living in such a dangerous city. I found the comment insulting and insensitive, especially in light of the recent shooting in Gilroy, which is not that far from Oakland. I thought about the comment the entire stay, especially when walking around crowded Waikiki. Please tell your staff to be more sensitive about that topic. I am appalled that someone in the hospitality industry would even think to make such an insensitive and rude remark to a guest. I did not catch his name. (And, alternatively, I’d like to praise Eddie from the bell desk, who was extremely friendly with us the entire stay.)· Billing error – I reserved a rate that included a $150 resort credit. I scrutinized my bill and noticed that it wasn’t applied and had to take time out of a very busy departure day to clear that up with the front desk. I’m glad I noticed it and received a refund, but I shouldn’t have had to do any of that. · Baby amenities – Before we arrived on Oahu, I’d emailed twice in advance and even mentioned to someone on the phone that we needed a crib in our room. We arrived around noon and were told to come back at 3 pm for our room and I reminded the front desk that we needed a crib in the room. When we arrived at our room, there was no crib. We mentioned this to the bellhop who delivered our bags and he called housekeeping for a crib, which was not delivered on time for our baby’s afternoon nap. I was also surprised at the lack of other baby amenities at a hotel of your price point. We are frequent travelers and most hotels also offer white noise machines and some offer infant tubs (especially those hotels without bathtubs). Our baby was a bit too big for the bathroom sink so I had to hold him in the shower every night.· Inefficient housekeeping line of communication – We had pleasant interactions with the housekeeping staff we’d encounter in the hallway, but to reach them to schedule our room cleaning was quite the endeavor since I had to call the main line and request a transfer to housekeeping. Once, nobody from housekeeping picked up and I wasted several minutes on the phone repeating this process. I’m not sure if there is a direct line to housekeeper and if so, why it wasn’t included on the welcome card by the phone.· Elevator – The wait for the elevators was quite long and because we were on a higher floor, it took several minutes for us to reach the lobby due to multiple stops on the way down. I was annoyed whenever I’d encounter a staff member taking the elevator just a few floors down. Couldn’t they use the stairs for that instead of delaying the guests? Also, the bellhops should use a service elevator to deliver bags instead of clogging the guest elevators.· Lack of service at the pool – I was at the pool every day for seven days and was only asked if I needed anything once, even if the servers were chatting up/helping the people right next to me. I’m not sure why I was overlooked so often. Also, I’m not sure why certain guests were provided chair covers while I was never offered one. Also, it would be nice if your staff would take time to visit the kiddie pool to check on the parents. It was difficult for me to get anything when I had to carry my baby and my gear back and forth whenever I needed a new towel, etc. · No live music – We were excited to listen to live music at the pool during the evening but on one day there was no musician. We were also ignored by the staff there to the point that we left without receiving so much as a glass of water.I'm sad to say that I would think twice before staying here. I had such high hopes for this resort and left feeling quite bitter. I spent time drafting the list of poor experiences for them but the lack of response to me despite three follow up emails over two weeks shows how little they actually value the guest experience.",,Jennifer C,5,2.0

The housekeeper that cleaned our room everyday is one of the most amazing & sweetest ladies we’ve met. We went back to grab some items when she was cleaning and she was professional had an amazing personality. I’m glad we saw her on our floor multiple times. The pool was great! Drinks were pricey but tasty! My biggest issue with this hotel was the check in process. We were only one hour or less early and they had no rooms available. We were downgraded and compensated for it but once we were in the room, I hated it. It ruined the experience for us. Within 15 minutes I called the front desk and had them change our room. They gave us something that was the partial ocean view but it was pretty much no view. However, I was not about to move a second time. Next, the pool was closed after 3 pm second night of our stay for a private event. I was pissed because we picked the hotel for the pool. Fine, went to the beach instead. However, we came back late at like 9:30 and whatever event they had was LOOUUUD. It sounded like their was a Loya boom box in our bedroom. It was so bad we had to call downstairs because our 8 month old son couldn’t sleep. Brings me to the cleanliness of our first crib, DISGUSTING. Second was was ok. The worst pet of the stay is that after everything that we had to deal with, they couldn’t accommodate us to stay an extra night at our initial rate or wave the resort fee at least. On top of that, they wanted to charge us more because we had to move to a different room since there was maintenance scheduled in ours the next day. It was upsetting and not wanting to move our stuff to a different hotel we decided to fly home instead of staying an extra night. Never staying here again!

Easy to find good food nearby and plenty of ABC stores for the essentials. Very comfortable King bed with a good room size. The only grumble is the bathroom which appeared to be an oversight with a bad design flaw of the door only just clearing the toilet. Far too small for a high end hotel and room. Although it was good to have mirror and the sinks outside the bathroom for dual people use at the same time.

Instead of receiving the room we originally paid for (partial ocean view King), we were told when checking in that the “category class” we booked was overbooked. So instead of offering us a free upgrade (which is what any respectable hotel would do) they said we could upgrade our room for $500 plus taxes or stay in a city view queen room. Already having spent quite a bit of money on our FIVE night stay and after 12 hours of traveling, we were exhausted and agreed to take the city view queen. The room was a total downgrade in all aspects. The “lanai” (balcony) I paid for? Non-existent. The view? From what I could see out of the tiny sliver of a window was of the top of a roof littered with cigarettes and used cups. The bathroom was so tiny that every time I closed the door my leg touched the toilet. The bed sheets felt like paper. I am a seasoned traveler (for both work and for leisure) and never in my entire life have I been told that a hotel didn’t have my room available and then been downgraded. This room should have listed on their website as the lowest class for a significant discount (I’m serious). Instead, you will not see it on their site, probably because they are so embarrassed they have rooms like this.I also want to mention that we met another couple at breakfast in which the same thing happened to them and they were also downgraded! The scheme this hotel is running is unacceptable and ruined our Hawaii experience. Shame on them. I would never stay here again. Next time I would stay in a well-known chain where they know how to treat their customers and where I know what I am paying for.Shame on you Alohilani.

It’s huge and overrun with tour groups.We were in the main tower and had a high floor,which was lovely, giving views over Diamond Head, but I didn’t expect such long queues for the lifts all the time. Yes it was school holidays but when they remodelled the hotel they should have added extra lifts to that tower or even a separate bank for the pool floor. The hotel is basically 30 or 40 years old and although the bedrooms have fairly new soft furnishings they have remodelled the bathrooms so that the vanity sink is outside of the absolutely tiny wc and shower room. I have never been on a cruise ship or slept on a train but I cannot imagine anything being as small as these bathrooms ! Also due to the era the hotel was built, the sound insulation is non existent. Not only from adjacent rooms but also from above (despite the 80’s artex ceilings!) and if you are on a lower floor from outside too.The pool was small, noisy and on the 5th floor which also led to aforementioned lift queues. It is a wind tunnel there as the pool is stuck between the 2 towers! However the redeeming features were the Longboard Club, giving a little bit of sanctuary and generally all the staff were very friendly.

Our first two days there were so enjoyable. We loved the hotel, the location, and the helpful staff. In addition to planning to return back in the future, we were also remarking to each other about how we would highly recommend the hotel to our family and friends. This was up until our third night.After a sunset dinner at the Outrigger Canoe Club we decided to go back to the hotel for a post-dinner nap before enjoying more of Waikiki during our last night there. We arrived back at the hotel around 8 pm and woke up around 9:45 pm to inaudible arguing outside of our 28th floor room. Within a minute we heard what sounded like the phone. This was soon after followed by banging on our door. My partner rushed to open the door and he quickly ran back in breathless to tell me that we had to evacuate because there was a fire outside. I rushed out of bed and opened the door to terrified hotel guests and smoke filling up in the hallway. When I turned to the left of our room 2855, within 5 ft away I saw a small fire growing from the carpet and going up the wall. Some guests were yelling it was an electrical fire and that we had to evacuate. My partner and I quickly went back into the room to get water to try to extinguish the flame. After trying to extinguish the fire ourselves with water, we tried connecting to the staff on the hotel line, but had no luck getting through. We started to pack our belongings but more guests on the floor began banging on our door to evacuate the building. We then started our descent down 28 floors with the other guests.Once we got to the lobby, I knew it was important to notify the hotel staff exactly where the fire started. I calmly asked a receptionist to step aside in order to prevent any panic amongst hotel guests checking in and those who had evacuated after hearing the fire alarm. I informed the receptionist that there was a fire on the 28th floor outside of room 2855 and that my partner and I had attempted to extinguish it before evacuating. She looked in complete shock and went to phone the update immediately. Soon after I saw a man exit an office near the front desk, who the receptionist quickly went over to meet. He turned out to be the hotel manager on duty that night, and the second person I informed that there was a fire on the 28th floor outside of room 2855. Within 2-3 minutes we heard the sound of fire trucks arriving at the hotel. This is when the hotel manager went outside to meet the first responders. I also saw a valet man go up to meet the firecrews. This man was the third person I informed that there was a fire on the 28th floor outside of room 2855.After 20-30 minutes the fire crew began to exit the building. The hotel manager then announced that the fire department had extinguished the fire, the elevators were going to resume operations, and hotel guests could return to their rooms in the Seascape building. I went up to ask the manager what the guests affected on the 28th floor should do, especially in the case of me and my partner with the fire being outside of our room. The manager assured me that I could get a new room after checking in with reception. I then asked what we should do if all of our clothes now smell like smoke. And he said the hotel could arrange for dry cleaning. A bit alarmed by this response, I went back to my partner to tell him the update. This is when I overheard a little girl tell another girl that there was a fire on the 26th floor. At this point I attributed this to hearsay. As more fire crew began to start packing, my partner stopped one fireman to ask if they determined the cause of the fire. The fireman told him that there was a fire on the 26th floor and that they were still trying to determine the cause. This was when my partner told him there was also a fire on the 28th floor outside of room 2855. The fireman immediately picked up his intercom to report the second fire to the remaining crew. The fireman told my partner that they were not informed of a second fire in the hotel and this was the first time they heard about a fire reported on the 28th floor outside of room 2855. Within the span of the 40 minutes that we first saw the fire outside our room, evacuated, and reported the fire to 3 separate hotel staff, the fire department was completely unaware of a second fire in the hotel that night. The hotel staff had let guests back into the building even before the fire crew were able to investigate the second fire. The fire crew asked us if we would be willing to go back into the building and were all completely shocked that the second fire had not been reported to them. We gave our accounts to both the fire crew and policeman who finally made it up to the 28th floor. A firewoman was the person to suggest to us to try to get a fire discount from the hotel for experiencing the incident outside of our room. The only people who thanked us that night for extinguishing and reporting the fire were the first responders. We did not receive any thank yous from any hotel staff members that night or when we checked out the following day.In fact, when we went to go ask for a room change, we were given a smaller room than the ocean view king room that we had paid and worse it was located in the back of the hotel where the dumpsters were. My partner and I were very shaken up from the incident and restless our final night at the Alohilani. No hotel staff ever came to check in on us that night or the following morning. The only call we got the following morning was from the Honolulu fire investigator asking for our statement. We were never offered a late check out to help make up for the interruption of the previous night. We were never offered a meal to make the next morning’s start any easier. When I checked out and asked the receptionist to speak to the hotel manager, she first inquired why and after learning that we were victims of the hotel fire she offered to cover one night of resort fee. This was the first offer of any compensation and it was barely anything. When the hotel manager on duty that morning came out to greet us, I recounted my concern with the hotel’s emergency response the previous night and shock that the staff did not report the second fire to the department. The hotel manager’s first response after hearing this was, “well I have heard differently and we are still reviewing video footage to investigate the incident.” I had told her that I was not there to get any compensation, I just wanted to share my complete disappointment and sadness with the lack of hospitality, customer service, and common decency to check in on any of the guests directly affected by the fire, especially those who risked their lives to extinguish the fire and save other guests and the hotel property itself. The hotel manager did not show any sympathy or empathy. She did not even ask for my name. She did not provide her card or show any willingness to try to make up for the situation in any way. She then offered to cover the three full nights of resort fee. I told her that when people come to stay at a 4 star hotel like the Aloholini, they come for both a memorable experience and also to feel safe. We did not feel either staying at the Alohilani and even more so after the hotel management’s lack of response the night of the fire and lack of courteous human response the morning after. I asked her if we could at least be refunded for the Sunday night stay in which we were victims of what ended up being hotel arson (two additional nights of arson attacks happened in neighboring Waikiki hotels after ours). She said because we booked through a third party, there was nothing she could do. I asked her to at least try. I have not received any follow ups in any form from the Alohilani hotel since.What started off as a relaxing recharge turned into a complete nightmare to live through. We ended up not being able to sleep well the rest of our stay on the north shore after the arson attack at the Alohilani. My partner and I were both traumatized by the fire and the hotel’s lack of care for what we had experienced and helped to prevent from turning into what could have very well be a much more dangerous incident. In trying to preserve their image, the hotel management failed to recognize that hospitality and customer care are important in both good and bad experiences.",,nkatherine29,3,1.0

Very noisey rooms - you can constantly hear all the toilets flushing in the adjacent rooms and from the floors above, along with street noise and noisey air conditioning unit.

The room was not sound-proofed at all. We could hear the next door guests having a conversation as if we were in the same room. Furthermore, there was a child staying in the next room and the child would occasionally scream or cry (and yes, in the middle of the night and early in the morning too). Because of the noise problem, I asked one of the staffs if it would be possible for us to move to a different room. The person told us that there is only ""standard room"" available and that the resort cannot give us anything ""higher."" Although we didn't expect to move to a ""higher"" room, we at least expected to move to a comparable or slightly worse room. However, we were moved to a room 322 on the other ""Beachside"" building which was a half-basement - we were looking at people's feet and basically left without anything pleasant to look at. Because the staff also waived our resort fee, we decided to suck it up and move on. (2) Process of Moving But what really upset us more was the process of moving. I asked the staff if we could have 20 minutes of time to pack and prepare to move to a new room. However, the staff sent us someone well short of 20 minutes. The person knocked on our door and was standing on our doorway. Although the person did not hurry us, we felt hurried to put away our clothes. On this process, we left a bathing suit hanging in the bathroom. Within 1 hour of moving, I asked the same staff who moved us if there is any way we can retrieve the bathing suit. The staff told us that she will ""check"" with the housekeeping team. After the housekeeping team stated that they found nothing in the room - which is a total lie because we know we left our bathing suit there - the staff told us that there is nothing she can and will do and that it is highly likely that the housekeeping has thrown away our bathing suit. I do realize that it was our own fault. However, she did not even say she is sorry to hear that or she didn't even show any sympathy. Overall, Alohilani does have a wonderful infinity pool and the original room that we were assigned to had amazing view of the Waikiki ocean. So anyone else may have had a wonderful time in the same room absent the noise issue that we faced. But for us personally, Alohilani ruined our honeymoon.

We have previously stayed at the Laylow in a room with a partial ocean view and though the hotel is not on the beach, the view was much better than what the Alohilani calls an “ocean view,” (plus the hotel and staff there are simply superb, which I can’t say about the Alohani).

The door opened onto the toilet and the bathroom itself was so small, barley 2 people could use it at the one time. The pool area, although lovely, was overcrowded with a million children and families, not quite the most happening part of the hotel if you're young wild and free, literally kids everywhere, oh and don't expect to nab a good seat, they go fast. Come mid-afternoon the pool gets very little sun and the pool area seems to be situated in the middle of a wind tunnel, so glue down your wigs! The daily resort fee is also an absolute rort, you are literally paying for nothing but a jam-packed pool area full nasty loud children. Staff were friendly and the other public areas are lovely.

One of the stays they stuck us on 6th floor and the balcony was directly in view of people lounging by pool so that wasn't great. People could just look into the room so we kept curtains drawn when we were inside. Love that they have water fill stations for reusable bottles. The parking can be really bad depending on time of day because they allow for non guests to also park there which I find unfair for guests. Also had an issue with a cabana rental, or more so our server. We rented the cabana for half day which is 12:30 to 5:30. Server was nice and never gave us trouble, but she wasn't our server for the full time and swapped out with another girl around 4PM. Instead of just letting us know she was swapping servers, she made us close out our bill early (presumably so she would get the full tip) and open up a new bill with the next server.

We were able to go down 39 flights of stairs and wait outside for 8 to 9 minutes before the arrival of the fire department. The manager on site, who was genuinely trying his best, did not have much support from the staff on site. They were still checking in staff and oblivious to the emergency situation, there was no water or food available, and there was no communication with guests. We didn’t get back to our room until almost 1 AM, between the response by the Fire department, Police Department, and elevator company. Emergency responders were excellent.

We moved from another prestigious hotel (it was just too far away from the wonderful mayhem that is Waikiki Beach) and looked at several hotels before settling on the 'Alohilani:1.

You have decide whether you like rapid beach access. You can be on the beach in 2 minutes. 3. You have to decide whether you want to be in the center of activity. The 'Alohilani is in the center of things. If you walk out, you will find people walking around, restaurants and shopping.Check-in was easy. When the line got long, someone actually came out and apologized, gave everyone water and added another receptionist. The check-in staff were extremely helpful. The lobby plays lounge music and gives the place a hip vibe. The usual mix of clientele walking around from couples to some families. The bar is nice and feels good. I like sitting at bars and this one had a good feel. The backdrop is a massive aquarium. There is enough seating. The LongBoard Lounge was a great for us. The food offerings are not extensive but certainly enough. Beer and wine is available and the wine offerings are excellent. I like lounges and paid the extra dollars. The staff is superb.The pool is negative edge and sits on the 5th floor of the hotel. There are always people there but we never had a problem finding a spot to sit.

Overall we had a nice experience. Very nice spot which is located across the street from the beach and along the strip with all the shops and restaurants.Check in was quick and painless, and we were given a room on the 32nd floor. I had requested for a king bed at the time of booking, but ended up with a room with two queens. They said it was because of availability. Our room faced Diamond Head, so we did get a partial view of the ocean. The room was sufficient. The beds were comfortable enough. The shower and toilet worked adequately. We had a mini fridge which came in handy. We did not venture to the pool, so I can't comment on that. We did hit up the O Bar a few times, and had a pleasant experience every time. There's a good sized aquarium there for your viewing pleasure. One night they had live music which was cool. You can also order food at the bar, and the food we tried was excellent. We went to the Lychee Restaurant for breakfast. They had a nice buffet style selection and an omelet station. The food that we tried was pretty good.The modern decor of the hotel was very cool. The first floor area is wide open and spacious. I love that they had a water filling station next to the elevator. The only real setback was that we got stuck in one of the elevators on our second night at the hotel. At around 10pm, we were trying to get to the 32nd floor, and a mother and daughter were trying to get the 20th floor. The elevator stopped at 16 and was stuck. We were told by security through the intercom that an elevator tech would come out, but they ended up calling the fire dept to pry open the doors. We were stuck in there for at least 30 min with no ac. It was a most unpleasant experience. There were hotel workers waiting for us as they opened the doors with bottled waters in their hands. Guest relations gave us a credit to be used at the hotel for our troubles. It was a nice gesture and was greatly appreciated. So other than the elevator mishap, we had a very nice experience.

Truly our only disappointment was our micro-fridge chilled so well it froze some of our snacks and beverages...and having to leave.

Overall, the service was good throughout the hotel, especially our cleaning guy (perhaps named Christian?) was particularly courteous and did an excellent job. The only notable exception we encountered (twice) was the service at the pool bar whose staff's service can be compared to the performance of the immigration officer on our way at LAX airport: making people feel welcome isn't of course the primary task of border control and similar thinking seemed to apply at the pool bar.

Ocean VIEW rooms = side, partial view ONLYTo get full ocean view you must pay the price, and the view is great in these roomsDo not stay in lower floors (below 15) if you are a light sleeper. You be staring at Circle Waikiki / Waikik resort rooms or worse still, listening to loud pool music if you are in that block. Walls are thin so good luck if you stay next to noisy groups/ kidsPool: talking about pool/ bring your headset as the music is blasting all day. Ok if you like the music played. Not good for people like me who prefers a quiet pool to enjoy the beautiful tranquil beach view. Bed: very comfortableDesign: stupid. Open style toilet so a big inconvenience if you have different waking habits. Eg you cannot close off door to do your private grooming, make less noise - such as hair drying Hair dryer so stupid- you are stretching yr head to the dryer as the cord is only 20cm long! No shower although room description is shower/tub. It's actually merged with a tub. So small, 7ft talller guys would be knocking over. No shower cap, no toothbrush, no disposable shavers. For a 5* hotel you'd expect such convenienceNice coffee maker, not kettle though. Housekeeping: Superb. Room always immaculate with amenities enuf for no of people in the room. Facilities: gym is big & comprehensive equipments. Not crowded., Free lessons. Pool: Pitiful. Advertised as infinity to draw Instagram crowd but otherwise, you cannot swim a decent lap in it. Just to soak. So swimmers, take note. Deck beds always crowded. Therefore it is not a resort! There are hardly enuf beds to meet the demands. You are literally squeezed in a renovated 5th floor deck! ( forget the resort type lounges/ pool a la Marriott resort) For USD350 a night, it doesn't qualify as a resort. More like a hip hotel. Negatives about the pool- no control by attendant. You do not need a key to obtain towels so anyone can stroll in to use the pool, which is already tiny! Selfish people leave their towels there to 'hold' the beds for hours, again no control by pool attendants. Nice cookie breaks by pool attendants every few hours. Refreshing mint water by pool. Reception: polite but not overly friendly. You do not get that 'welcome to Hawaii' feeling.Also, they should consider directing enquiries other than room specific to the concierge. It's annoying standing and waiting for guests to check-in and ask loads of tour related questions when you just want to crash after a 30hr journey! Having walked along stretch of hotels, I'd recommend Hyatt Regency, Marriott Resort. Note: Towards zoo end, lots of homeless who smells ( sorry to say this but police should relocate them. We met a really scary lunatic who shouts & flung his arms aggressively. And they take up the beach tables and that section reeks of foul smell) Sad actually. Hilton, Marriott Courtyard and Hyatt Place are not along Waikiki beach. Hotel Halekulani is gorgeous. Sheraton is still under renovation so DO NOT BOOk!

Sadly not quite.Our experience mimics a lot of the comments on here. In my opinion there was nothing grossly bad about the Alohilani but there was nothing truly great either... except the bed. The bed was fabulous :) We found the rooms to be very clean, personally I liked the modern minimal decor and our partial ocean view from 1601 was better than ok. But the noise from other guests, doors slamming, the lifts and the pool area is unbelievably loud. Plus where are the basics?? No robes, no wine glasses, no minibar, no room service and a cramped small bathroom ... surely these amenities are not unrealistic expectations of a 5 star hotel?The pool area was a good experience for us. It wasn't over crowed and we easily secured a couch & shade.

Meanwhile, we kept calling and no one answered so we left few voice massages. After few days we decided to call front desk and ask if there are any other way we can book it, then they transferred the call back to the sales coordinator still didn’t answer our call.She finally get back to us after 6 days, we felt so frustrated and disappointed for this experience. Not sure if it’s because we used the complimentary so we are being treated disrespectfully or they are generally have a bad customer service. Another thing is that we are using the complimentary but when checked out we still need to pay $90~ Resort Amenity fee. Also, the parking fee alone is $30 a night?! Overall this hotel doesn’t worth the price, can have much better choices with this price range.

The location is very convenient and central to most things in Waikiki. On arrival, we thought the foyer and O Bar were great, just loved the coral artwork behind the check-in desk and of course the aquarium and its inhabitants :) Our room was good, beds were very comfy, our bathroom was well appointed and very clean. We dined at Morimoto which was fabulous and highly recommended. The good pretty much stopped there sadly. It was impossible to sleep with the very large and noisy aircon running, the hallways are particularly noisy - slamming doors, noisy conversations, crying children etc echoing which is extremely annoying when you are trying to get a decent nights sleep. We were also a little surprised that there was no swipe card security in the elevators, so anyone could access the accommodation floors. The main reason for the poor rating though is the fact that the pool and surrounding deck is not exclusive to the hotels paying guests. This property like many others charges a $40 USD per night fee for the use of the pool and other amenities, which we knew about and were happy to pay, but we didn't expect to compete with people (large and loud groups) from other hotels when trying to order food and drinks, not to mention find somewhere to sit or heaven forbid, squeeze into the pool :( We will certainly return to Waikiki but will be doing a lot more research before booking accommodation and we will never return to this particular hotel again.","Devonport, Australia","suzy1961</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Devonport, Australia</strong>",3,2.0

But then..Zero organisation at reception. There were lines of people at every desk and some being served quicker than others. People cutting the queues to ask ""quick questions"" were not redirected to concierge or bell desk. There was no cold town and welcome drink (as advertised on the package for direct bookings) . Check in thereafter was easy enough.We got to our room - Nice and spacious.. nothing overly special. The rooms in the old renovated building (closest to the beach) still have the old sliding doors & frames which are rough and not easy to open and close and they let a lot of street noise & air-con generator noise in. The bathrooms are a horrible lay out - the toilet is literally at the door & next to the shower. You have to go in and step to the right & shut the door to use both & there is no space to move. No complimentary water & no wine glasses or bottle openers etc.The infinity pool is on level 3 - there was NO signage in our building. No directions from staff at check in & no instructions or guidance in any ""in room guide"". We went up and down the halls & had to ask another guest (also perplexed on arrival) & they directed us to .... the fire escape - a door that is usually alarmed, so we would never have walked out of it. The pool was cloudy pretty much our entire stay, so we barely went in.Service around the pool area was poor. It was slow and the staff were not very friendly. They would avoid eye contact so they didn't have to come over & they would stand and talk among themselves when people were waiting for them to catch their eye. We found out later (after complaining) that they had been churning through some staff over the months & hadn't got a good team together yet. There were some weird cocktails on the list too ... didn't quite work but you could tell they were trying to be different.The pool itself was in the shade quite a lot of the time & it was also very windy much of the time. But in contrast - the chairs behind the pool deck were blocked by the wind and very hot to lay in as they caught more of the sun. We struggled to find a happy medium.The gym was great! loads of good equipment all in good nick. The coffee shop on the main strip out side the hotel is awesome!! Great frozen coconut frappe (get a double shot) and great snacks an takeaway breakfast/lunch options. Good coffee - roasted in house. (name escapes me now unfortunately).Morimoto was GREAT!!! went 3 times!!!Location - it was ok ... bit far up the strip. If you like beach swims, you'll enjoy the location.

It was a great decision. We had two queen beds, stayed for a week, and were very happy with our stay. Rooms: The decor is modern and fresh. The room was very clean, good working AC, big TV, fridge, coffee maker, and a decent size that fit our family of four. The room also had a balcony with chairs providing a nice ocean view. Overall the room is nice but not luxurious. Bathroom:It's small. No double vanity, no robes or slippers (or similar amenities you'd expect in a luxury hotel), and the toilet is nearly inside the shower.Location:Great but: 1) The resort is not on the sand. You need to physically cross the street to hit the beach. 2) The resort is located near the southeastern end of Kalakaua Ave. The restaurants and shopping centers are all located the opposite direction. Staff and Service:Excellent. We never encountered a single employee that wasn't extremely nice, hospitable, friendly, engaging, helpful, and genuinely interested in providing good service. I honestly thought about the reviews where people spoke of bad service and rude or unfriendly staff and I can't even imagine that being true from my experience with valet, the bellhop, spa, and the front desk. For example, Gabrielle was our server at the pool cabana and she was excellent. Attentive, prompt, made recommendations and suggestions on what to eat at the pool and around Oahu generally.Loved it, would go back.","San Diego, California","chriscJ9470AJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",2,5.0

Hotel is located along the main street (escapes me) and you are just walking distance from Royal Hawaiian, International Marketplace and DFS (among others). Great restaurants as well surrounding the hotel. This is about the only good thing about this hotel.Rooms: Below average. They don't have slippers for guests. They don't have toothbrushes. They don't even provide complimentary bottled water in your room. For USD375 per night - these are small cost items they can put in to make the guest feel like the hotel is after their convenience.Bathrooms: Way below average. We were given one of those bathtub/shower combos that are messy and inconvenient. The drain kept clogging. The toilet bowl is around 5 inches from the edge of the tub - which makes one wonder who would luxuriate in the tub with a view of the toilet just inches away? Shower curtains need to be burned - they stink.Beds: Above average. Comfortable bed - firmness is just right. One queen sized bed each for me and my son.Beddings: Average. Nothing great. Nothing bad. Just average.Hotel Service: Below average. Staff isn't friendly - but they are not rude. They are just in a hurry all the time. No time for a smile or a hello - it's just a bland ""Hi. Yes?"" You would expect something more from a Hawaiian resort - but apparently, this is not the case. Eating around during our weeklong stay would suggest that they normal Hawaiian hospitality is quite warm and welcoming - the same isn't true for the hotel staff.Misc: 1) Just odd notes that might be of interest. They have someone in the hotel that called my wife at 8am trying to sell time shares. The next day, they called my room at around 9am with the same intent. Seems odd that the hotel is allowing this to happen.2) Twice, housekeeping knocked and opened the door asking if we want to have our room cleaned already. This was 9 in the morning. It seems they expect us to be out of our room by 9am. How early do Hawaiians normally wake up?3) The property provided free wifi to guests.",Manila,"sandychan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila</strong>",7,2.0

The rooms are large and the beds are exceptional...so comfortable!! We had double rooms with Oceanviews and they were both great rooms. The bathrooms are pretty good and the shower pressure is good - must say the only strange thing is that the toilets are extremely loud (flush like aeroplanes) and you can hear every single time toilets are flushed in all the rooms around & above, which means that you hear them mostly late at night and early morning. The pool area is lovely and well appointed. Loads of different seating options which is great to have at a hotel. Not often you see more than just sun lounges, so that was great! The service staff are very good (the room service and reception especially), only staff that let down the team were the concierges who need a lot more training in being helpful and pleasant - they left a lot to be desired which is a shame as they are the ones who should be the most pleasant and helpful.

Note that if you look at the hotel photos online, the odd looking hallway carpets are new but just a strange pattern.We liked that we were given reusable water bottles on check-in, such a good idea. The water refill stations are on Level 1, which is a bit annoying when you're thirsty at 10pm, but still a great idea overall.Staff we're great. Pool is nice, and looks towards Waikiki beach. Gym is near new, and excellent.Be aware that if you stay longer than 6 nights, the hotel auto-charges your credit card for the first 6-days. Unfortunately we weren't told about it when we checked in. It was an issue for us, as they also held the full amount on check-in, so both amounts combined maxed out our credit card (Aussie banks take a couple of days to release the held amount). Something to consider for your circumstances.Location is fairly good, lots to do (and in our opinion the better part of Waikiki beach), and we spent a lot of our time to the West of the hotel along Kalakaua Avenue.Alohilani is right opposite the sheltered lagoon on Waikiki beach (minimal ocean waves) but you can paddle out further for a surf if that's your thing.

There's also a free hula show on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 6pm, about 50m to the west of the hotel, along the beach front.If you're an Aussie that likes espresso style coffee, rather than American filtered style, definitely go to ""Kai Coffee"" directly downstairs on Kalakaua Avenue.

The shower and toilet are seperate to the sink and mirror. There's a door in between but no door to hide you getting changed in front of the mirror. There is another mirror in the room which reflects perfectly so the other person can see you if they are in bed. Why not get changed where the shower is you ask?

First was 3 days in the bigger of the 2 towers. About level 23. Room was quite and comfy. Second stay there was for 6 night and was in the smaller tower level 12. Right above the pool. Which is clearly not controlled as there were guests partying well past 4:40 am ( we checked out at this time) the room we had was interconnecting and we had a baby and loud talkers staying next door, we asked to be moved they said they would get back to us. They didn’t. We wrote a google review while still there. They didn’t care and just said sorry and would pass on our comments. This hotel looks pretty. But that’s it. Pool drinks are very expensive. And poor service from bar staff. Lots of places are better to had a drink. They room toiletries weren’t nice and in our first stay they clearly weren’t checked as the bottles were half full. Air con was either hot or freezing. Would not keep to a constant temp. Resort fees are very expensive for what they say you get. Queue when waiting to check in can be very long at times and disorganised with no actual line so basically if your pushy and rude you go next. Cleaner decided to vaccume outside rooms at 8:30 am a few times. I must say only really positive I found here compared to the other place we stayed on our last visits was its right above KAI coffee. While the wait could be between 10 and 30 mins for a coffee. It was one of the best coffees we had while there.

Bathrooms so small you practically had to stand on toilet to shut the door. As for partial ocean view, yes if you lean out balcony and look left you can see the ocean between the other hotels. When we changed rooms, they gave us ocean view which was nice but the room smelled when the air conditioner came on like it was taking in air from their kitchen exhaust outlet. We gave up and bought an air freshener. The room and balcony doors need sound proofing because you can hear all the noise in the hall and outside street level - doors slamming closed and especially the elevators ringing when they arrive at your floor.

Ocean front room on 12 floor. Lovely views and you see all sorts from here. However, we think we should have had a room away from the Main Street. The rooms were clean and light. Bed was comfortable. But it was noisy pretty much all night. I guess on the beach front you have to expect this but it was the homeless people who seem to dwell on the rise opposite that fought through the night who made lots of noise. People banged doors loudly and one night we had the air con off the music from the room next door came through our vent so loudly it woke us. This seemed odd. We also found the air con noisy at night but when turned off the room was too hot. No winning here really. The bathroom as others have said is very small with mere centimetres to spare when you sat on the loo and closed the door. A larger person would struggle. I’m 5 ft and found the space claustrophobic. Amenities a bit short. If you don’t want wet hair, take your own shower cap as you won’t get one here. Pillows were very very soft and one traveller had to deal with a sore neck.Upside ... good location, excellent restaurant on level 1 Momosana, friendly staff, clean, nice poolside area for snacks in the evening, good pool towels.Be aware of the resort fee. It’s a bit pricey, but excellent fast wifi included. They do tack on a tree tax mid way in the final account. You need to ask to have this removed. This should be optional, not assumed.

And we all thought the food and drinks were better by the pool rather than in the O Bar. I assume the food all comes from the same kitchen, so maybe it was just the environment that made the food seem better.As many others have commented, the toilet/bath area is tiny. I guess there must be some sort of fire regulation or structural need for the internal wall, but a good investment by 'Alohilani would be to get an engineer to sort out the bathroom area. The concierge area was a nightmare for us; they kept trying to sell us some sort of timeshare, to the extent, that after day two, we avoided using the concierges.The real rating for this review should be a 4.5, but I can't do that, rounded up to a five.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","SententiaOnTravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",13,5.0

We rented a car for the week so we could explore the island (a must). Parking is very expensive on the island but not at our resort. We bought a week parking pass in the hotel which cost less than %50 the price of a daily pass. This is also a must. There are two GREAT restaurants on the ground floor. One is pricey but worth it (Morimoto) and the other is perfect for your daily ramen fix (Momosan.)

Overall, we were happy with our stay. The bed was extremely comfortable, room clean and the pool/spa are excellent. Staff were accommodating but this is definitely not a 5 star hotel. The facilities did not meet standards of other 5 star hotels I have stayed in previously. No body wash in the supplies, or hand soap at the basin. There was also nowhere to hang wet bathing suits, or towels after being in the water. The bathrooms are TINY and the door only clears the toilet by a matter of 1-2cm. No robes or slippers which would have been nice as it is cool in the evenings and I had really sore feet from hiking and a cut from the reef. No amenities kit, no mini bar, no room service. Breakfast was stupidly expensive so we went out every day to get our own. Maid service was ok but bare minimum, made bed and topped up coffee supplies. Was kept up a couple of nights from loud noise (people screaming!) in the pool past 11pm. Rang front desk and was told it would be sorted but the screaming went on until 12am when the pool closed.

Went down 3 times and couldn’t get a seat. In the pool itself, it was standing room only. Kids everywhere, splashing and very loud music blaring. I refused to pay the resort fee, as I didn’t get to use the facilities.

To set the scene, though, I have to first warn people about Hawaii if you haven't been there.We love Hawaii - it's just so - well, mahalo. It's chill, it's relaxed, as long as you don't erroneously expect a modern luxurious holiday - which you certainly won't be getting, and that's tough considering the price you have to pay. America in general is very run down, tired, in desperate need of infrastructure spend. It's worse in Hawaií, as it's a locked-in Democratic state - both the Dems and the GOP know that money spent will make no difference to the electoral outcomes so is a waste, hence: no infrastructure spend. There's no industry but tourism (and the miltary!!!) and (at a guess) 85% of the hotels are owned off-shore, so that's where the profits go.If you've been to Fiji then you'll know what Hawaii is like - a bit richer than Fiji, but not much. (And that's not saying a lot!) It's not as garishly touristy as Bali, and the quality is higher, though very run down.I first visited in around 1987 - it looked tired then, and from what I can see there's not been much spent since then. Downtown Honolulu is OK, but Waikiki is like a tired Surfers Paradise. (As an example - the beachside showers in the dead centre of the prime beach of Waikiki were rusty pipes with no shower heads. Really, guys? Seriously?So read this review of Alohilani in light of that background.I have a vague idea that the Alohilani ""Resort"" hotel (it's big stretch to call itself a ""resort"") used to be the Pacific Beach hotel, and it got pretty thoughourly renovated recently - I'd guess at maybe three years ago. And the renovation was done very well - a little on the frugal side, but it does have Japanese toilet seats! - which I'm a big fan of, though you certainly don't need your toilet seat heated in Hawaii. But a large part of their customer base is Japanese, hence the toilet seats. All in all a very satisfactory renovation, economically done, but very effective.A big caution here: We had ocean-front rooms, and that had a huge effect on our enjoyment - and there aren't many ocean front rooms. My wife fought like a rabid cat to ensure that room was the ones that we got, and I'm glad she did. In particular room 25 (we had 1125) stands out as the very best room on the floor. So we had the best of what Alohilani could offer, and it was good.(My wife would like to explain that the fight was not with Alohilani, but with Agoda, and even though we won, we'll never be using Agoda again.)I'm not going to nit-pick. This rates a solid four in my judgement.The manager must be good at his job - the staff in general were great, most things worked as they should - and we had a great time there.Thanks Alohilani - you're not a five, but a very solid four.If, however, we had been in one of the vast majority of rooms which did not have full beach frontage, then I suspect I'd be rating it no higher than a three.","Canberra, Australia","NeilInOz51</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",66,4.0

This stay at the Alohilani was a little disappointing and some aspects of the hotel seem to have changed since we last stayed in Nov. 2018. The view from the room and balcony is seriously amazing—just as pictured on the website. However, the bathrooms in the oceanfront king rooms are incredibly small and poorly configured. The bathroom door opens into the bathroom and only clears the toilet and sink by a few inches—this means you have to shimmy around the door and toilet each time you want to access or leave the bathroom—which was annoying. They told us this was a very common complaint for the oceanfront king rooms (the bathrooms in the other types of rooms can be normal sized).Since our last stay six months ago, the resort fee has increased to $40 (previously $35), however, the services offered have actually decreased! Including, no more complementary welcome drinks and no longer offering turndown service. Additionally, the batting cages are now $85 per hour.On a positive note, the cabanas are amazing to relax in for the day—especially the one on the end with the ocean view.Overall, while the view and the cabanas were amazing, the price point doesn’t seem to match the offerings for an oceanfront king room. Additionally, the services are inconsistent and seem to be decreasing .

Hotel was very nice. Clean rooms, comfy beds, great pool area, friendly people. Drinks in the pool area were fantastic, but remember you are at a resort so you will have much higher prices.

Close to restaurants, shopping and the beach.The hotel itself is updated. The lobby is definitely beautiful. The room is quite small and the pool area is an okay size. Things like that would be difficult to change.But what needs to change is the customer service. A simple “hello!” can change someone’s entire mood. No one ever greeted us in the lobby. Even when we first arrived there was no effort, basically checked us in and that was it. During our time at the pool they weren’t as helpful in helping us with our stroller (there’s wasn’t any ramp for us to bring the stroller, so we ended up carrying our stroller up the steps every time) There was even a time when a male worker at the pool saw me waiting for someone to help me. And he just stood and looked at me. That same male worker I noticed only attended to “certain” people. DEAR MATT GRAUSO, if you are reading this and actually taking our reviews seriously; just having better costumer service can make a huge difference. And costumer service is what you guys should excel in because you guys are in the hospitality industry. Plus it doesn’t cost a penny to educate your staff. So forget your lobby design and your infinity pool and focus on costumer service!I’d try and take notes from 1Hotels (Miami); Beautiful hotel and excellent service! Definitely a 5 star!I will not be returning. But thank you for the Instagram worthy photos. And that is all.",,Followkc,1,3.0

The gym/fitness room is opened 5am - 10pm. They should open EARLIER, and stay open LONGER. Many people like to workout early, before heading out for a full day of activities, or workout later. Also, there should be some disinfectant available to wipe down the machines after use. The new Swell Pool is much nicer than the old pool. The website states that it is a SALTWATER infinity pool. It could be, but it definitely smelt like chlorine when I swam in it. No big deal really, but if it isn't saltwater, they should correct their website.

My girlfriends decided to rent a pool cabana for the day at Alohilani for some sun, relaxation, lunch, swimming, and cocktails. What an amazing Friday! I almost don’t want to write this review because I don’t want the secret to get out. There were four of us that rented a cabana which was AMAZING by the pool - it had an electric adjustable sunroof, nice ventilation for a breeze, a cooler, small safe for our personal belongings while we swam, 2 couches, music, plenty of plugs to charge our phones, lots of space and some lounge chairs sitting in a foot or two of water to cool off. It was SO NICE! We had a cocktail server at the pool named Stephanie and she was the BEST waitress I’ve ever had. We were so demanding ordering food, drinks, water, soda, wine, more food, more drinks, more ice, more water! She was on top of it and brought it fast. I couldn’t believe she had any other tables because she was so attentive to us it was like having our own personal cabana attendant. We tipped her a lot because she was amazing... & fun - we wished she could’ve hung out with us - ha! When we were enjoying our day, the manager Nikki kept coming to check on us. She came by with a cucumber toner spritzer and sprayed our faces, necks and shoulders and it smelled so good. Then later she sent a girl by to clean our sunglasses for us! I said to my friend, “I really need to get up and clean my glasses so I can read this magazine but I’m too comfortable and too lazy to get out of this chair right now.” Literally, 3 minutes later a girl working for Nikki is walking around the pool cleaning sunglasses and then comes by our cabana after! It.was.heaven. ❤️☀️ My friends and I have decided we are going to book a pool cabana with Nikki and Steph either once a month or once a quarter being we had such a great day. I highly recommend the luxury pool cabanas - you’ll think you’re in a whole sunroom, private resort. Also, I got so wrapped up telling you about the cabana I forgot to say the food is AMAZING, the drinks were perfect, the music level at the pool is good, Sean taught an awesome morning water aerobics class we all loved, the infinity pool overlooking Waikiki Beach is beautiful, and the place is just gorgeous!","Redondo Beach, California","JazzerMel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redondo Beach, California</strong>",0,5.0

No Aloha or welcome just a “are you checking in?” Hmmm You get the feeling they are working to a script and not “hospitality people” Same for the valet/front staff. Never in five days of walking by did they offer a greeting or any help generally gossiping amongst themselves. The hotel is in a sleek modern style which seems out of place for Hawaii.

Standards there are quite low in terms of accommodation, and we had to more than double our usual budget to get something decent in Hawaii. We ended up paying 500 AUD a night at the Alohilani. While I don't think it is worth anywhere near that much, this is the going rate for anything nice in Hawaii. We arrived with very low expectations, and were still surprised that no one bothered to come greet us when we arrived. Quite strange. When we got to our room we were underwhelmed by the view. Yes, there's a partial ocean view, which is lovely. But the rest of the view is of ugly, derelict buildings. We knew Waikiki would be pretty run down, but it was still disappointing. Our room itself was very modern and fresh, but quite small for what we are used to. The bathroom was tiny. Getting out of the shower involves a game of Tetris. We managed, but it's something to be mindful of if you need room to move. As we settled into our stay, we quickly came to love the Alohilani. The room is quite nice and all the facilities are to a high standard. It's in a brilliant location. Directly across from the beach, and right in the middle of the action. We didn't have issues with noise, except for the odd siren. We were able to walk to lots of great restaurants and cafes within minutes.The pool area is great, although the size of the pool and the number of people staying there meant it was usually fairly crowded (we went in April). There is a kids pool, but it's mostly in the shade. The jacuzzi was a great touch. We often went there after dinner. The oceanarium is a big hit with kids. Viewing the fish feeding was a highlight. They also do different activities each day. We attended the lei making class, which was a lot of fun. The lady running the class is brilliant. In terms of food, we only tried Momosan, and it was to die for! Highly recommended.It was really handy to have a water fountain and an ABC store on the ground level. We used both all the time. Overall, I would definitely not mind staying at the Alohilani again. It is very overpriced for what it is, but that seems to be the case anywhere in Hawaii.

The first night we had an issue with the shower drain and they came up promptly to fix it and even left us a cute note and some chocolates for our trouble. The pool and hot tub area is so beautiful and the seating on the other side by the bar is such a cool hangout area - especially at sunset or when they had live music. I had some great times dancing on the deck out there! The cabanas are pretty awesome and what makes the entire hotel experience that much better is the pool manager - Nikki. I cannot stress how much this woman made our vacation. She volunteered to take photo shoots of my friends and I, danced with us and even pointed us in the right direction to the nearest medic when I got sun poisoning. She is truly so caring and she deserves so much recognition. I had so much fun- the rooms were spacious and the porch outside was great for morning coffee or an afternoon snack overlooking the beach. The aquarium is awesome and I think that the only downfall is how expensive the breakfast was- but we actually never got a chance to go there. All and all I would love to go back - in fact, I dream about it. If you are looking for a great Hawaii experience in a clean, fun and updated hotel that's a 2 minute walk to the beach - stay here!

I am genuinely considering paying the fee to forfeit my stay here and seek alternative accomodation. Please do yourself a favour and book elsewhere.Do not fall for the facade of the fancy pictures online or flashy website. This hotel falls way short of anything it (or the price tag) is proposing to be. In the spirit of honesty and not in bitterness, here are the major shortcomings of this hotel:1). The doors to the hallway are totally useless. From your bed you can hear absolutely every conversation and footstep within 15-20 yards of your door. Not to mention clearly hearing the elevator beeping twice every time it arrives at your level! The incessant beeping will drive you crazy by keeping you awake at night and awake you in the morning!2). The partial ocean view rooms are hardly that. Generally speaking, it’s 100% you staring at the apartment block across the road unless you go out on the balcony and stand towards the side to get a decent view. No water views from inside the room whatsoever.3). The room is small and bathroom absolutely tiny. The bathroom door opens a couple of inches away from door. You can imagine the rest.4). Even on the 9th floor you can hear conversations on the street because balcony doors are so poor in quality (many things still remain from the original building prior to renovation).5). Very little is offered in the room (e.g. no alarm clock/Bluetooth speaker, no food in the mini bar, no slippers or robes unless asked for, no milk for the coffee machine, no ceiling light in bedroom only lamps etc.) Although priced like a luxury hotel, your room will be stocked like a three star hotel.6). The noisy pipes, noisy air con vent (even when off sounds like a blower vac is on outside), poor/absent sound proofing in the walls/ceiling (I can hear each neighbour open or close their drawers, sneezing etc.)7). The pool/outdoor area is deceptively advertised.I don’t enjoy doing this but for the sake of honesty, it’s best people know the truth before booking here.The two stars are for location, the staff and general cleanliness of the common areas.","Sydney, Australia","Sydney_AUS87</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",7,2.0

We stayed here for a few nights in Sept last year and after botching our arrival with an incorrect room the stay ended ok and we decided to give it another go for 14 nights in March this year. We booked months in advance, asked for a specific room and in the meantime had recommended this hotel to several friends and family who stayed here.So when we arrived to check in (surely they couldn't get it wrong again ??) we were informed that our room wasn't on the oceanside we requested, we only had a partial ocean view and it was tucked right at the rear of the front tower. There was construction going on below us and it just wasn't going to be pleasant. How hard can it be to facilitate guests in the correct room they book?? After much stamping of feet at the front desk, we finally were moved to an actual ocean view room. The deck and view were great but the constant smell of cigarette smoke from others smoking on their decks was horrible, especially as it's forbidden in the first place.!! And of course when you step out the front ocean side entrance the homeless are all sitting on the wall outside smoking up a storm of various substances, and often slumbering in the entrance. As we had to book 2 nights here through our travel agent as part of their package, we had to do a check out/ recheck in again for the last 2 nights. Surely this would be an easy task?? Not so. The receptionist handed me a receipt for 12 nights resort fee which she had just automatically billed to our credit card.!! As we had already paid this rip off fee on arrival it was fair to say that we were not impressed. It then took my ""significant other"" an hour of badgering to get this rectified. I had to walk away for fear of losing it!! So, did we have a great time?? The pool staff are great. Jenny, Micky, Nicki, Kayla, Steph, Suzy and of course Jones. We thank you sincerely for running around after us, being on call and for all those great cocktails and ""longboards. We are going back to Hawaii again in about 6 months time but I'm not sure that the Alohilani will receive my hard earned dollars again. Just too many things went wrong again and I don't think it will be 3rd time lucky. Sad really as we have promoted this place and have been responsible for friends and family spending thousands of dollars here. Some things to note. Make sure you actually get the room you book, check your receipts thoroughly and engage with the front desk at your own peril.

The view is stunning - truly amazing. Just like many of the other hotels in the vicinity. Unlike many other hotels here, the rooms however look like they belong in a midlevel Best Western. Spartan furnishings, an updated interior that can’t escape a 70s feel, and tiny. You literally have to wedge yourself into the bathroom - space is tight. The clientele seems mainly middle American families and bemused Japanese tourists who probably were wondering (as was I) what the deal was with the creepy family men ogling people on the pool (which is a delight when said creepy men weren’t hovering). This will sound meaner than it’s intended to, but the vibe from the clientele is closer to Chuck E. Cheese meets a dated Vegas pool club than whatever the original aim was. There’s no bugs, the amenities are great, and the staff are helpful and solicitous. However there’s no way this is a 5 or even 4 star experience as some sites would rate it. It simply isn’t. Don’t go here if you want upmarket; go here for clean and functional with epic views. After the upsell (on an already upgraded suite choice) I’m left with the sinking feeling I could have laid out a fraction (under 100/night) more and stayed at the Ritz. Literally. Given this is our sole planned trip for the year and we work HARD for the time off we take, I feel like we have cheated ourselves by not researching this hotel more and investigating the suites vs just blindly following ratings. The common thread of most of the negative reviews reflect our experience. Believe them if you value your money and want to avoid feeling duped instead of thrilled on your Hawaii vacay.The other common thread in the poor reviews is the placatory message from Alohilani after a negative review on TA. Given the sheer volume and recent weight of complaints perhaps less time should be spent apologizing and more time doing the necessary measures to ensure a more honest experience: stop letting your resort be considered luxury when it’s not. Have a sense of decency and honesty. We don’t want your apologies, we don’t want to be deceived in the first place.

We stayed in an Ocean Front room on a high floor which was well worth it as we found ourselves enjoying the view and watching the passing humanity constantly. The only criticism is the very small bathrooms which initially came as quite a shock as the overall room is spacious, but in the end did not spoil our stay. What really made our stay unforgettable was the way we were treated by the staff - in particular the Guest Service Manager Ami Sueyoshi who went way above and beyond the call of duty to make sure our stay was unforgettable - she certainly succeeded in this and ensured that we are looking forward to staying again at the Alohilani and enjoying the pool, the cabanas, the bar and huge fishtank, the location, the wonderful food at the onsite restaurant Morimoto and the great view from the ocean front tower rooms.",,EG310,0,5.0

It took over a week for the funds to be resolved.Generally I would not recommend this property to an older crowd, if your 50+ you probably will feel a bit out of place and not enjoy the music.","Sydney, Australia","Fiona K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",11,4.0

This was a bit of a splurge after a week in a condo but not ridiculously expensive given the quality. Stylish and classy resort with very little of the cheesiness you find at other Waikiki resorts; everything new and clean instead of old and tired. First class fitness center, worthy of an independent health club. Beautiful experience at the rooftop bar & infinity pool. Note that the hotel allows late checkout at a nominal extra charge. This is very handy for the many people who have night flights back to the Mainland. We (family of 4) took two rooms, and they let us keep one of the rooms until 6pm for an upcharge of something like $90. This enabled us to have a full day of activities in Honolulu and take showers before heading to the airport, without having to pack up and stow luggage. My 4 star rating reflects a few criticisms. First is the easy one: if you book two rooms for a family of four, where two of the people are kids, you expect to get the rooms close together if not adjoining. When we checked in, we were told that the rooms were on separate floors. Duh. Come on guys. They were able to fix this, though it required lengthy putzing around at check-in. Second is the harder one: as many other people have complained, the bathrooms are tiny, like what I'd expect to see in a Salaryman hotel in Japan, not a luxury resort. In general the rooms are not enormous, though certainly adequate and what are you doing in your room anyway when you should be exploring the island?Finally, the food options in the hotel do not encourage staying on the property. There are two overpriced celebrity-chef places and a VERY overpriced breakfast buffet. We've had better and better-value dining experiences even elsewhere on Waikiki.Otherwise very nice experience.","New York City, New York","billrosenblatt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",42,4.0

The lobby is opulently grand and stunning but unfortunately that's where the positives stop. Upon entering their highest class of room; ocean front, you realise there is no way this is a 5* hotel as advertised everywhere online and even their receptionist informed me that's not a real standard, they're actually 4*. The bathroom was the size of a shoebox, literally you can't enter and close the door without shimmying around the toilet. The room was clean and otherwise unimpressive, the view was pretty spectacular in fairness. After checking in we went down to the pool to grab a drink and some food, this is where things got strange, the guests at this place were really the bottom of the barrel, loud obnoxious and classless are the only polite words i can think of. We had a group of guys taking pictures/videos of my wife while we were sat by the pool making really sick comments. We spoke with the staff to let them know we felt uncomfortable and their response was there is nothing they could do. Slightly incredulous, we simply left and checked into the Ritz for the same price as our room. The ritz to mention was absolutely spectacular and couldn't fault them on anything. Service, rooms, facilites and environment were all top notch and couldn't be beat in waikiki. This place is really just a tourist trap designed to look like a luxury destination hotel but the reality is holiday inn levels of service and quality. In fairness to their management they did not argue when i told them we were checking out 2 hours after checking in and they arranged a full refund of the booking fees without hesitation. I think their employees know the standard of their guests and understand they misrepresent themselves as luxury when really it's basic at best with a great location.

If you are looking to stay somewhere special and splurge a little, this is definitely worth it, especially if you have a Hawaiian license. For 275 (with tax), we had an ocean view King size room. The room was super clean, the view was amazing with a small deck and the beds were SO comfortable. We also had complimentary Mai Tai's we enjoyed in the chairs in the infinity pool overlooking the city. It was also ""after hours"", around 5 pm, so they let us sit there for free and provided us with towels which was awesome. This deal also include FREE parking. We had a parking pass and with a rental could move around the island worry free. In addition, we could use all the amenities, even after check out and they even checked us in 3 hours earlier; this helped us stay for 2 full days and only one night. On top of all that, the hotel is BEAUTIFUL. Decor is amazing, staff is so kind and the oceanarium is great. We got to see a fish feeding with one of their divers and there was a ton of activities and other deals provided. A great place if you are with someone special and also a great place if you have a family. This place accommodates both. ",,Vacation662537,0,5.0

This hotel is RACIST and I felt discriminated. I’ve never felt so humiliated in my life. The Asian lady doing Leigh’s Friday at 1:30 told me and my 8 year old daughter we couldn’t join because there was not enough flowers when there was a table with so many flowers. “Because there were not enough” or more likely because were Hispanic and not white or Asian like the other people making Leighs. At the pool everyone else was getting served but us. How come the group of Asian influencers got VIP service when they barely consumed or probably didn’t just to give you a good promo on IG. How come the white family in front of us ordered and ate. How ever I had to stop a server in order to get acknowledged and served. Sat there for over an hour no one approached. If we were there it is because We can afford it and we don’t want ANYTHING FOR FREE. This is exactly why when the manager approached to offer we didn’t even asked for anything she brought us stuff. Which was good on her behalf but not enough for all the BS your staff got us thru. Not to mention on our last night my husband took my 8 year old to eat at the ramen place and it was 9:45 and they told them they were not serving them because it was too late. When you close at 10pm. It’s a child that’s hungry where’s the compassion the care for your customers. It’s funny how a Colombian couple that we met at the pool felt the same way. DISCRIMINATED FOR BEING HISPANIC.

We stayed in an Ocean View (King bed) room and it was very comfortable. There was a partial ocean view, and we could have upgraded to a Premier Ocean View for an extra US$120 per night, but didn't think it was worth the extra money, as we could see the ocean and the mountains from our balcony. Breakfasts were included in our deal - breakfast box from the O Bar (fruit, muffins/bagels, yoghurt and snack bar). Thank you to Marlene for looking after us each morning at the O Bar - she was very helpful and friendly.The only downside was the service at the Swell Bar. We waited for a server to come and take our order. When this did not happen, I went to the bar to order. I was totally ignored and everyone around me was served. I ended up asking to be served (I am a woman 60+ years old). This happened on another occasion, and my husband came over and stood by my side. He was served immediately. So, I can only surmise that the staff do not want to serve older women at the bar. Therefore, we did not return to the Swell Bar, but took our money and custom to other establishments outside the hotel.We ate at the Morimoto Restaurant on one occasion, and the food was fantastic. We had Peking Duck as a main and it was cooked perfectly.Overall, it was a great hotel - but quite expensive. Was it worth it?

Have stayed 4 years ago and it was great. We stayed in an Ocean Front room which was more expensive than other options, and found it very cramped. The bathroom is so small you have to squeeze up beside the toilet to close the door, the giant sized cabinet takes up half the space and you need to stand inside the shower/bath to dry off as there is no room outside the tub. The noise from other guest rooms is ridiculous, /doors slam all day and night, they do not lock unless slammed. The sliding door to the balcony did not have lock or latch just a hole with a large screw to put in it and did not close fully. The staff don't seem to care at all. We had to turn A/C off so we could sleep the noise from them is like a rocket taking off. The refurbishment has been cheap and nasty. The pool area is interesting either windy or in the shade for most of the day. A big space but not ideal to spend much time there. Across the road to the beach for a swim is a better option. On the plus side the hotel has a great location, it looks beautiful from the check in counter but that is where it ends. We stored our bags on arrival until our room was ready, we were offered someone else's luggage twice before they bought the correct luggage out and we were not offered any assistance so struggled to the lifts with our 4 bags. don't be fooled by the photos shown on their website or on their bio, not at all what we had.

My phone was left behind in a closed banquet hall where I was with work colleagues and hotel staff. Shortly after leaving, I realized my phone had been left behind. I notified the front desk that evening and they said hotel policy is for cleaning staff to turn the phone into security and I should back in the morning after the hotel had been cleaned for the night. However, to no avail, the phone had not been turned in the next day.Later that afternoon around 2pm, I get an email from my icloud account saying my iphone has ""been found""... the phone was pinging to a location outside of waikiki. I called the phone, it rang and rang (insead of going to voicemail like it had earlier). I was now in an uber on my way to the location of the phone. I arrived, and found that it was pinging to a storage unit 2 miles outside of waikiki. I called again a second time, and the phone went to voicemail, and as I'm standing in the stoarage unit, it stops pinging the phone. Meaning the phone was in the building at the same time as I was standing in, and whoever had it, was clearly not intending on returning it. The storage unit staff would not help without contacting the police first, so I did. I notify the police who decide to investigate. Mind you, my work colleagues and I are all visiting Hawaii, none of us are renting a storage unit, and they were the only other ones who couldve have access to my phone. I notified the hotel manager upon return that I believe a hotel employee may potentially have taken the phone instead of returning it (because I had no plausible explaation as to how the phone was at a storage unit), and asked if they'd be willing to review their security footage. Jenny, the hotel manager said she would get back to me...the day went on, and I did not hear back from the hotel manager. Having realized the phone was taken by someone from the resort and was pinging to a storage unit, I changed the original message which stated ""cash reward for this phone if found"" to something along the lines of ""this phone is stolen, please return immediately."" The following day at 630am, my boyfriend gets a call to his cell phone from someone stating that they ""found the phone, and would return it if they could get the cash reward."" This person was in the hotel, on their way up to our floor, which is odd given there are two different towers in this hotel and I don't know how he knew which tower we were in. He asked for the exact room number. Within seconds a man arrives at the door. I asked him who he was, he stated his first name. He hands me my phone, and the cover is missing, the glass screen protector is missing, and the sim card has been removed...I asked him who he is and how he found the phone. The man is clearly nervous and delays answering questiosn with ""uhhh, uhhhh"". I keep asking him, and he states he found the phone 2 nights ago while cleaning (the night the phone went missing!).... and then he still had the nerve to ask me for a cash reward. What kind of hotel employee request a cash reward for a stolen item?!?? I went downstairs and notified the new hotel manager who said he will look into and get back to me... and the morning progressed, and he did not get in touch with me.I also notified the police that this phone has now been returned since the police report had been filed, and I'm not even more concerned, because clearly this person tried to steal the phone (why else remove the sim card, cover and protector). Also, why put it in a storage unit?? Are there other stolen goods there?? I also googled the number this hotel employee called us from and was able to get his last night from a simple search. I notified a 3rd hotel manager at this point, as the overnight manager had left. Guess what they said?? ""We'll look into it, and get back to you"" I literally managed to do most of the heavy lifting in locating my phone, this person states he is a hotel employee, confirmed that he ""found my phone"" 2 nights prior when cleaning, and clearly did not follow hotel policy to return all lost valuables to security, instead, took out my sim card, cover and protector and had it sitting in a storage unit 2 miles from the hotel. Clearly this person had intended to sale this phone as a new phone.... At no point did hotel management call me back. That was my day of departure and I asked for an update and the best they could tell me was ""it is a person who works for a 3rd party vendor for cleaning our hotel..."" This is $1000 phone. This is the equivalent of taking a watch, jewelry or any other valuable item. They stated they were going to open an internal investigation. I find it absurd that at a ""5-star"" resort in Hawaii something like this could happen, but I find it even more absurd that this hotel did not take ownership and were not proactive about communicating with me. Transparency with your customers should be a priority, especially when it comes to criminal activity on your hotel property by a hotel employee. DO NOT STAY HERE!! There are a lot of options to stay in Waikiki, there is no need to stay at a hotel where you can't rely on the staff to not steal your stuff (3rd party vendor or not). Also, the hotel managers did not call back or update me at any point as they said they would. They even took my cell phone number, but not once did they call. I literally spent almost 1.5 days of my trip dealing with this. This was meant to be a relaxing business trip, instead, I'm trying to figure out how and why a hotel employee stole my phone. If I had not gone after the phone myself or inquired further, it seems they would not have even bothered and hope to sweep this under the rug.ABOUT THE HOTEL ITSELF:-small pool and 1 hot tub which is a insufficient size for the number of guests this accommodates, gets very crowded fast-extremely expensive drink and food at the pool compared to other pool bars in the area. Talking ~$15 for one mai tai.-very, very loud!! our initial room was on the 9th floor, not even directly facing the pool, (which is open from 6am to 10pm) and music is on always, so afternoon naps are hard to come by. Music was literally blasting into the room at 6am. They did give us a quieter room on the backside of the hotel eventually, which I appreciate.The only pro about this place is the Morimoto restaurants, but you dont need to stay at the hotel to eat here. Just call and make a reservation on your own. You don't need to go through the hotel concierge to manage to get a table. The location is close to the beach... but then again, so are all of the waikiki hotels.","San Francisco, California","Atlas236</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",12,1.0

We landed on a Friday evening and took an uber to the hotel. Even with rush hour, it just took a little over half an hour. The location is great. Just a block from the beach with great food and shopping all around. Upon entering the hotel, the lobby was very impressive. Ami, one of the managers on duty, checked us in. She was very sweet, but yet professional. She found out we were in town for our babymoon and upgraded us! We were in room 1767. It's a corner room where you can get the ocean AND mountain view. It was breathtaking. If at all possible get this corner on any floor. Also after a few minutes of getting into our room, a plate of fruit and macaroons were sent up to congratulate us on the baby! The treatment was completely first class here.They also give you water pouches that you can fill with water at any of the water stations in the lobby. But if you find a need to get any snacks or drinks for the room there are dozens of ABC stores within a block of the hotel. Marukame Udon is also about a 5 minute walk away. A must try. There's usually a line wrapped around outside, so it's hard to miss. Also, we rented a car once we arrived from the Avis location at the international market shopping area a couple blocks away. Self parking at the hotel is $35/day, so if you just need a car for the day you can pick up early in the morning and return the rental car in the evening to avoid the parking fee at the hotel. The Avis mentioned has a very late return time, but I would recommend prebooking a car. We went during low season and lots of people were turned away at check-in who did not have reservations.

The rooms were nicely appointed and very clean. Housekeeping does a really nice job always. The views of the beach and Diamond Head are wonderful. I was truly impressed by the quality of the food (and I’m a *really* tough critic, particularly when it comes to dining). We ate at O Bar almost exclusively when we ate at the hotel (our two year old loved the oceanarium), and whether it was breakfast, lunch or dinner every meal was absolutely delicious. Fresh ingredients, immaculate preparation, and good service always had us looking forward to our next meal there. I highly recommend the kale chicken Caesar. We had it everyday for lunch. Where this property really shines, though, is its staff. From the moment we arrived, we found the staff at Alohilani to be truly exceptional. They are consistently warm, welcoming, professional and effective. Of course, even in a group of this caliber, there were standouts. Without question, the one who made our stay so special and left us with such warm memories of Alohilani, was Eddie at the Bell Desk. We travel a lot and almost exclusively stay at five star properties, and yet we cannot remember another hotel employee who went so far above and beyond his job than Eddie. Somehow from check-in through the duration of our stay, Eddie made us feel like we were his personal guests. He was at once our bellman, our concierge, our local friend with all the great inside knowledge of the city, and even someone we could count on to help us wrangle our VERY active toddler. For example, one night at dinner as my husband and I were lamenting not being able to eat our entrees because we were constantly having to run off to chase the baby, here came Eddie, on his way out for the night after finishing his shift, who scooped the little one up and started cheerfully bouncing him and distracting him so we could eat in peace for a few minutes. (Incidentally, our toddler found Eddie so endearing he’s been asking for him ever since we left.) Just when we didn’t think Eddie could possibly do any more for us, he even went so far as to call some of his contacts at the next hotel on our Hawaii itinerary to ensure that when we checked in there we would be well taken care of. He was undoubtedly the highlight of our trip, and we were truly sad when it was time to say goodbye. Additionally, Jill, one of the hotel managers was wonderful about fixing any of our concerns, and Guillermo at O Bar is a gem of a man who always took great care of us and made us feel special. The ladies who run O Bar for breakfast are also lovely. We miss their smiles already! We would like to extend a huge thank you to Eddie, Jill, Guillermo and the rest of the staff at Alohilani for making what was to be essentially a short stopever stay, into a trip that we will never, ever forget.

Alohilani was the cherry on top of a great vacation. I will separate this review into: Amenities, Night Sleep, Customer Service, Location.Amenities: As advertised Alohilani was renovated and has an outstanding fitness facility on premise, that is great for keeping fit even on vacation and is so convenient to use. The Tennis Courts were also fabulous we didnt play as we are not big tennis players but they looked great. The different bars are great for the different tastes and moods of the clientele. The O Bar is a beautiful welcome and waiting area, and the Swell Bar at the pool is great for your mid day beer and even for a late night relaxed vibe. The prices are not cheap but they match every other bar and restaurant in the area. The Lobby is breath taking and fresh makes you feel relaxed as soon as you step in.The one area they are lacking is with bedroom amenities. For a 5 star resort you expect to have certain things such as: robes, champagne flutes, a mini bar, etc.This is the only limitation and things such as the coffee and toiletries seem a bit cheap foir the status of the hotel. Night Sleep: We got a gorgeous Partial View King Bedroom on the 38th floor. When we opened the door it felt like the pictures on the website, it was lovely. The bed is super comfy and the pillows are too. Adored the balcony to have our morning coffee and the amount of storage space was very appreciated. The bathroom is nicely divided between toilet/shower and sink which is good if you need to get ready at the same time, great lighting too my makeup was on point throughout my vacation. However, the bathroom is very small, and there is no space to hang the towels and the toiletries are a bit on the cheaper end. Feels more like a 3 star hotel in the shower than a 5 star.The walls are very thin. We could hear everything our neighbours said and do. Thankfully they were a family and not partiers so the noise wasnt too too bad but it is definitely something that takes from the experience. Customer Service:Here´s where the 5 star review lies. What a spectacular service!! Everyone is super friendly and attentive to our needs. When we arrived to the front desk Jane made our vacation amazing from the start, she was supper professional, attentive, sweet, everything you can expect from the industry and more. She helped us get the perfect room and guided us through the ins and outs of the resort always with a smile on her face. I lack words to express how amazing she was. If I could write a whole review on her I would. The servers at swell bar were ok, some of them are very nice and attentive while others seem to just be doing their job. LocationRight on the heart of waikiki the beach is merely crossing the street and you can walk to all the bar, restuarants, shops and amenities. If you´re looking for more of a nature resort this is not it but it is the best for the city vibes mix.",,Fernanda U,5,5.0

I had split my stay and stayed at a 4.5 star hotel and then came back to alohilani feeling quite underwhelmed. The pros of this hotel are - location (not as central as Moana but still in a great location). Maccas next door , Burger King around the corner comes handy as there’s no room service- generally clean rooms as they are new which was a big drawing card for me when researching - Doug at the front and some other staff were helpful with helping us get around. - momosan ramen downstairs is some of the best ramen I have ever had. Didn’t have Morimotos but would assume it’s just as good - beautiful mesmerising aquarium tank which my baby enjoyed - one bell man kindly asked if we needed a cot which front desk didn’t. - abc store downstairs which was convenient - two complimentary water for first night. they give u bottle bags to refill downstairs. I guess that is a good initiative to cut cost and also be eco friendly. Negatives - - front desk , upon check in , asked if it was a special occasion. We in fact was celebrating our anniversary but nothing special was done so no light touches of anything here. - biggest disappointment: The interior of the rooms are very basic and cheap. Yes they are new but it’s not five star quality. The bathroom is so tiny and the toilet in one of our rooms literally touches the door. The rooms are also extremely noisy/ not sound proofed well that I could hear every god damn time the toilet flushed next door in our room (during our second part of our trip) in the poolside tower. By this time, I was so not bothered and had enough of this hotel I just copped it. No room service is a big fail. The buffet only opens for breakfast. Housekeeping have been inconsistent during our stay. they don’t provide body wash gel but body wash soap. This is a meant to be a five star property. We had soap as well as body wash gel at our other 4.5 star hotel. Housekeeping also shoved small rubbish on the floor behind the toilet instead of picking it up. Tip - ask for towels from the pool and then go to the beach. But if u are in the seaside tower u have to walk to the other tower to get it. no robes and slippers are also a big fail. I was disappointed by this but more disappointed when I saw alohilani posting photos of people on Instagram that had robes and slippers?! I’m confused. Do they only provide it for people who stay at premier ocean front rooms? I would love to know the answer to this?! I stayed at partial ocean and ocean room category rooms and we didn’t get it? I don’t understand this at all! No kettles or microwave in room. If u are a parent trying to sterilise ur babies things this will be hard! U will have to request it.YOU have to ask for toothbrush and toiletries here!!!!!!! The other hotels we stayed it brang it to our room upon check in! Without asking! No shaving kits or cotton buds provided or offered at alohilani. House keeping knock at your door and literally yell throughout the corridors at 7-8am in the morning. This was horrible. I could even hear from my poor proofed room one person in another room yelling back “too early” to housekeeping!!!!! Tip - u must put a door sign to avoid this. Before I stayed here, I read that there are two towers one of which is “brand new”. I asked a question on this forum and alohilani said both r renovated towers - true but one is definitely more better built than the other. Tip - Book a room in the tower closest to the beach. It is better done than the other tower which had the pool and we had the actual air con unit in the room next to the bed - It’s truely eye sore! Also the ceiling is exposed painted concrete in this tower and so ugly and cheap looking. I read that the fitout of this hotel is cheaply done and I agree. The bath has a 70s shower curtain. One word-gross. not five star quality. As someone else has pointed out in their review, The quilt / blanket is not covered!!!!!! I really don’t understand this!!!!! Had a late night snack and drinks at the aquarium bar and the lady took my bill & tip but didn’t take our dish away For a good while! Staff seem uninterested in this part of the hotel and I have come during different times of the day. Other observations: Pool - the kids pool was good but filled up w children very quickly so there’s no room to sit if it’s a hot dayThe adults pool was great I saw other kids in the spa and I believe that’s not in line w pool rules however it was not managed on the few times I was at the pool. They have kids movie nights and Lei making classesConclusion - Compared to other hotels, there are No personal touches or effort from staff to remember ur name or greet you. This is a big disappointment for me as I believe the staff make the experience in five star properties. I actually will remember Doug as he was a top guy! And some other staff who have been here for 40 plus years that seem to care about their guests. I would say if you could get a good price for this room than it’s not bad , it’s sufficient and clean and otherwise good however the noise and quality of the rooms were a huge disappointment.I was looking forward to this hotel the most. if you are looking for five star and want a memorable stay, maybe look at Halekulani or prince hotel and you will notice the difference as I have.

Bathroom was quite small. Shower was basic but with adequate water pressure. No tub. I stayed here alone but feel like it would be quite cramped with more than one person. The interior and public areas of the hotel were very nice. Beautiful aquarium in the lobby. ABC store located right next to the elevator was very convenient. Hotel is directly across the street from the beach, although the beach is extremely crowded. Surprisingly, no room service (quite unusual for 4-5 star property). Never received new glasses from housekeeping despite setting used ones out. Within walking distance of more restaurants than one could possibly eat at in five days.

We chose the Alohilani after looking at the reviews for almost every hotel in Waikiki over and over (like you are probably doing right now). Every hotel, to include the Alohilani, had some really bad reviews that worried me but the location is why we finally decided on booking with them and I just hoped the rest would be ok. We've been here for 4 days now and I've had the chance to see some of the other hotels as we walk around and shop so I'm 100% positive we chose the right hotel! Let's start with the location: the Alohilani is across the street from the beach where you can book surfing/paddle board lessons right there, a 5 minute walk to the Zoo, a 30-40 minute walk to Diamond Head crater and 2 minutes from every kind of restaurant you can hope for (from low priced Subway/McDonalds to mid priced sandwich shops to higher priced everything else) basically this is an absolutely perfect area. Now I'll tell you about the hotel itself: it's beautiful and my room is amazing. It has an oversized king bed, huge tv, nice dresser and a comfy loveseat that I can look at the ocean from if I don't want to be on the small but big enough for us balcony. Though you may not care... it has a heated toilet seat in the bathroom... I didn't care until I used it and now I've googled how to install one at my house. It also has a bidet that I'm not sophisticated enough to try. I read reviews on the small bathroom and yes it's smaller but how much room do you need in a hotel bathroom?!? I'm on the 17 floor and the water pressure couldn't be better for the shower. I also read reviews on how horrible the elevators are so I'll talk about that. Like other reviews said, there are only 3 elevators so I'll talk about my longest wait time: I waited just under 1 minute once I hit the button (yes, I timed it because of the other reviews) and it stopped twice on the way down to pick up other people. It took me 2 1/2 minutes total to go down to the lobby... that was the longest wait so if that's horrible to you then it is what it is. The pool is smaller but it was never really packed, the hot tub is smaller but it was only packed a couple times. The Ocean is 100 feet away and was never packed. The live entertainment in the bar is really nice. The gym hasn't been too busy for us and there is a wide array of equipment (bikes, treadmills etc...). The front desk staff, specifically Landon, has been nothing but excellent and helped us out a lot. One last thing and then I'll shut up ;) Having an ABC store in the hotel is amazing. It's open 7am-midnight I think and the prices are waaaay lower than I would have thought they would be. They have snacks, booze, beer, food, soda, gifts, clothes... basically everything. Good luck choosing your hotel in Waikiki, I hope I've helped.",,Matthew B,1,5.0

It’s in a great location, close to the beach and shops. It’s clean and recently updated with a fresh and modern vibe. The aquarium in the lobby is definitely a nice touch. The concierge was very helpful and the pool area was very relaxing (despite being a wind tunnel). Now the not so great. We booked a beach view room and when we got there we were informed that the room was located on the side of the building. This meant that we had to crane our necks over the balcony to see the beach. Apparently, we needed to upgrade to a frontal beach room which would give us a full ocean view. In other words they overcharge for a partial ocean view room. There is also no elevator security (you don’t need to swipe you room key to access your floor). This is concerning as there is entry to the hotel from an ABC store located on the main strip; across the road from which, there is a congregation of homeless people looking for shelter in the evening. Perhaps the most disappointing part of the stay however, was that I left a bag of shopping behind and when I called to see if it had been handed in, they said nothing was found. So either someone on staff has treated themselves to a dress and hand cream, or unobservant employee thrown away $100 worth of shopping. Either way, not impressed. Overall, it was a pleasant hotel, clean and modern, but would probably stay elsewhere next time and get more value for my dollar.

The Alohilani Resort bills itself as a 5 star property but it is anything but. What you see in photos does not represent the actual product once you are checked in. Some highlights and (mostly) low-lights from our stay: PRO: Happy Hours at both bars. Prices still a little high, but it's Waikiki. It is what it is.CON: The pool is abso-effing-ly freezing. During the day. With the sun up. The wind cuts through the two towers like a valley, creating a chilling wind tunnel that makes the pool deck unenjoyable. PRO: Sipping a craft cocktail or tropical drink in the jacuzzi or infinity pool watching the Hawaiian sunsetCON: The infinity pool is FREEZING despite the fact that it's supposedly heated. Maybe if I was in Antarctica the pool would feel warm, but not in Hawaii. As others have mentioned, the jacuzzi is SWARMED with kids, despite posted signage. There is absolutely NO regulation or enforcement. The staff advised us that security has been told but they do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, so be warned. If you don't mind kids in diapers splashing pee and poop infested water into your drink, this is the place for you. PRO: Centrally located and right across the beachCON: So is pretty much every hotel in Waikiki, and most others don't overcharge you for a subpar product. PRO: Lots of dining options on property CONS: All of them are overpriced and not very good. Even Morimoto's two restaurants are underwhelming. You are better off walking a little ways from the hotel as there are much, much, better dining options (i.e. Tiki's, Arancino, Maui Brewing Co, Cheesecake Factory--yes, even Cheesecake Factory!)CON: Bathrooms are TINY.

It's too bad they didn't finish the job in the rooms and neglected to think about security.First, the rooms have incredibly tiny bathrooms. The toilet and shower are in a separate room so small you almost have to climb over the toilet to get in because the door opens into the room in front of the toilet. Outside there is a tiny vanity with a single sink.The door to the hallway might have been replaced in the renovation, but it didn't fit properly--there was a significant gap all around it judging by the light coming through. Noise from people in the hallway came right through the door.The door to the adjoining room was obviously original judging by the door hardware, and it had zero soundproofing qualities. The people next door were clearly audible speaking at a normal conversational volume. When they laughed and played music they might as well have been in the same room with us.In terms of security, after we checked in, we discovered that the door to the adjoining room on our side was unlocked. That is a major fail on the part of housekeeping.Even worse, the ground floor elevator lobby has a door leading directly to the street, and this door was unlocked most of the time. The elevators don't require key card validation to operate so anyone could walk in from the street and go to any floor (including the pool) without passing any hotel staff or requiring a guest key card.Now that is a very serious security fail!After we had been there for a week, someone (presumably a member of the hotel staff) entered our room while we were out and removed the hair dryer. WTF. We spoke to the security manager about this, but we realized he wasn't going to do anything when he didn't take down any details such as our room number or name. It was just like ""whatever.""This hotel brags about it's lobby with a huge wall-to-wall fish tank, but what a sparse and uninviting space.

Average at best. The location is great right in the middle of Waikiki, however the resort itself needs to up its game.Firstly, front desk staff are not the came across a bit arrogant. Especially, when asking for assistance with issues.Our biggest issue was when the room next door to us was clearly smoking in their room. The rooms have the old-school connecting doors and the smoke (which was something other than cigarettes!) was coming into our room. We advised the front desk to be told they would notify security. Upon returning to our room later, it was even worse so clearly nothing had been done. We again advised the front desk and requested a room change if they weren't going to address the issue. The initial options the front desk gave us were to move to a room that would not be as nice. Advising them this was not going to be acceptable, it was a less than impressive response almost like a ""nothing we can do to help you"" one. After having to push the issue we were eventually given a new room that was acceptable. The room was not ready yet so we were advised they would monitor the progress and contact us when the room was ready. Upon the daily check-in time (3pm) when rooms should be ready we had not heard anything so went back to the front desk to check. Zero follow up had been made and we had to request them to organize the room for us - almost like having to check in all over again.Second issue was on checkout we were double charged for the breakfast package every day! We travel a lot all over the world and almost never get incorrect invoices on checkout. To be double charged something from our original booking - not even an additional change during our stay is very poor. Check your invoices on check-out.Other comments:The pool is not very impressive. Zero coverage such as umbrellas/shelter/shade unless you pay their ridiculously expensive rates for the cabanas.The rooms, while ""renovated"" are still quite old fashioned/dated. You can also clearly hear toilets flushing from neighboring rooms.As there are balconies, expect to have smoke from people smoking blow into your room even though rooms are non-smoking.Breakfast selection is limited. Very little vegetable options apart from salad leaves. If you like vegetables for breakfast and not just eggs, meat and fruit, you may struggle.On the plus, and a positive, the gym is very good for a hotel/resort gym. New equipment and good range if you have a gym routine you need to keep going while away, the gym will have everything you need.If you are looking for a Waikiki/Honolulu holiday, the accommodation is OK. However, if you are looking for a ""resort"" experience then I can't say this hit the mark for us.","Melbourne, Australia","CTW1982</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",5,3.0

The location of the hotel is excellent. The main shopping and restaurants are just a casual stroll away. Across the road is the beach. It was very busy when we ventured over so we didn’t spend too long there, preferring to lounge back in the comfort of the pool deck.

Rooms (we had premier ocean front rooms) were lovely and amazing views. The kids (3 teenagers) had the double room which was a good size and our king was also a good size. The bathroom in the king room was v small and really only one person could fit at a time. It is a slight negative but we didn't come here to spend time in the bathroom. We could smell smoke through our air-con a few nights in a row. I did mention it to reception and they sent maintenance straight up to change the filters of the air con. Not sure that was the problem - I think it may have been another guest smoking on the non smoking floor. You do hear noise from the early morning leaf blowers down below which is so annoying but not the hotels fault and I put up with it for the view. Pool area is nice and a good alternative when coming from the beach - if a little windy at times.Slight negatives- leaf blower 7am-8am most mornings (not directly the fault of the hotel but maybe the glass doors are not sound proof enough- very hard to get the phone enquires answered - for the smoke I had to go downstairs and we ended up taking our bags down ourselves on checkout as I rang out 3 times when trying to get the bellman- gym not signposted well and to me is in a strange spot overlooking the top of the fish tank - no natural light at all.- our breakfast was a breakfast box which contained the same ingredients every day for 8 days but I suggest this is more a luxury escapes issuePositives- amazing views from premier ocean front rooms- well set out and sized rooms (apart from bathroom size in King)- service was excellent at reception and the O bar and pool bar- location fantastic!

Recently renovated the hotel directly opposite the Kuhio Beach Park just down from Dukes Statue towards Diamond Head provides excellent accommodation, location and service. Our hotel room looked exactly like the photo on the website, where we sat and watched the surfers morning and night and of course the amazing sunsets. The beds were like sleeping on clouds with pillows to match. We even slept with the doors opened all night and found there was no street noise just the sound of crashing waves. Our only comment about the room is the size of the bathroom. Whilst extremely well appointed with ample vanity space and great shower there is little floor space. The pool area( 2 pools one for children and a wet edge pool for adults and children over 12) was sensational . A great place also to watch the sunset. My only comment here was the large presence of children under 12 in the adult wet edge pool. This should be the parents responsibility to adhere to the pool and hotel rules and use the other pool provided for children under 12 and to consider other guests. The pool attendant was as vigilant as she could be and explained it was something the hotel was working on to address. Pool Bar service was efficient and friendly. They also have another level to the pool area with cabanas, table, chairs lounges fire pit. The hotel is within walking distance of all the favourite food places in Waikiki and there is an ABC store in in the lobby at the front of the hotel . Surfboards etc can be hired a block away at reasonable prices ( cheaper than the beach).

It was not the room we reserved or where promised. It overlooked the parking lot instead of the ocean. When I asked they told me “our” room was occupied. They gave us an inferior room with no alternative. We were stuck so we had to make the best of it. Called down for a seat at breakfast the next day after checking hours for buffet and was told 10:30 it wrapped up. Went down at 10:10 and it was closed. Lame.

They provided a rollaway bed free of charge because of the inconvenience.Note that suites do have interconnecting rooms available albeit only a small number.The rooms themselves are smaller than Moana but given the amount of time spent in them and the interconnecting room config, it didn’t matter. The shower and toilet were in one room and sooooooo tiny. You had to step in the shower to close the door before you could go do the toilet. Rooms were clean and modern. Perhaps not as luxurious as depicted on the web, however still perfect for us. Ceiling height is quite low which prob adds to the small feel. There is a fridge, but no food or drinks stocked. No room service either. Rooms were serviced every day, however I don’t believe sheets were changed at all during our stay. View was great. Had visual of beach as well as diamond headToilet flush noisy and you could hear other apartments flushing toilet.Room doors not sealed well so you can hear lots going on in the corridor (didn’t bother me as we were at end of hall so not much happening, but might be more loud for those near lifts).We viewed a suite when we were there are they are sooooo much bigger. Bathroom is huge and rooms are much bigger. They had various activities during the day such as lei making and yoga, and kids movie by the pool once a week…although the daily activities didn’t change, so once you have done it, there is nothing much else to try.Gym was amazing with plenty of machines and weights, but it is on a level that doesn’t have any windows so a bit crappy with the outlook. Nonetheless, we attended every day. I didn’t try the breakfast buffet as it was expensive and as previously advised, we were told it was not included. Pool bar staff were great. Pool area and facilities were amazing. It is spacious, clean and comfortable. The sunset views from infinity pool was amazing. Pool was cold.Drinks and food at pool area were not cheap but the exchange rate didn’t help. They also tried to charge a fee for serving party of 6, but were welcoming and removed that charge as I noted we were two families.We unfortunately experienced a child drowning in the pool which was horrible and put a dampener on our holiday, however the staff were AMAZING. They stepped into action immediately with CPR and followed all necessary procedures. Following the incident they provided complimentary food and drinks due to the trauma. A let down was the charges they kept taking off our credit card without our authorisation. We gave our credit card on check in for bond, unaware that when we requested our food drinks etc within resort to be charged to our room, that they would take it immediately off our card. Normal practice is to pay at end of stay. Prob with them charging card was that we had credit card fees and a bad exchange rate. Upon realisation that this was occurring, we requested that the credit card be removed which it was. Great laundry facilities. Lots of washing machines and dryers.. clean and tidy There was no security with access to the hotel levels which was a little concerning as anyone off the street could enter. Great range of ages staying at the hotel. Location is perfect. Right across the beach and within walking distance of everything. Not sure if it fits the name of luxury hotel with the size of bathrooms and no fridge incidentals, bathrobes, slippers, room service etc, . In all, I would definitely recommend and return, however am much wiser on room sizes and also on charges to credit card.","Templestowe, Australia","397anitag</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Templestowe, Australia</strong>",23,4.0

I arrived on December 21st for a 12 night stay. My room had the most amazing views of the ocean on one side & diamond head & some high rise properties which at night looked great lit up, on the other side. I was on the 20th floor & had an end room so had the best of all views. My room was bright & airy. Bed so comfortable & the shower was amazing. I had my own balcony where I could chill with cold juices after a long day being the tourist. had my own fridge as well which was a nice touch as I could stock it up with cold drinks & snacks. If I had one tiny little gripe it would be for a bigger fridge!! :-) Please please for my next visit :-)The reception area in the hotel is huge & so elegant. The bar on the ground level is nice & chilled to unwind & have a few snacks & the dining room itself is huge. I only had breakfast there as I was out most days & the choice was exceptional. Smoothies, all types of fruits. Croissants, cold meats &, as we say here in the UK a good old fashioned fry-up!! Crispy bacon, varieties of sausage, I particularly liked was the Portuguese sausage, scrambled egg & so on. If you fancied an omelette the chef would make one whilst you wait. So many choices & I must admit a made the trip each morn a couple of times for breakfast :) A good variey of Japanese foods as well as a fair few guests were from Japan or of Japanese origin.The staff in the dining area were ultra friendly & helpful. Indeed after a couple of days I was chatting to 1 or 2 as though I had known them an age. An amazing feature whilst eating (& also on the ground level bar) is a huge aquarium with all types of colourful fish happily going abut there day. Great to see. I did a day trip to Maui. A day trip to the Big Island. A day trip around Oahu & I have to say such a big big thank you, sorry Mahalo :-) to a diamond of a lady named Monika in the Concierge Dept. She organised my activities brilliantly & it is her I really have to thank for making my dram trip a reality & such fun. A thorough professional with a warm heart who, after roughly 7-8 months of emailing arranging my holiday I felt she was more like a friend. To the Alohilani Resort you have 1 hell of an employee there & I hope Management are aware of this. Dedicated. Professional. Great lady. I loved my visit to this hotel & Hawaii so much I aim to return within the next 12 months & will certainly be staying here again (costs permitting of course) Each staff member was friendly & answered any questions I had. Even the cleaning room people were great & I chatted to 1 or 2 of them also. No airs & graces from the staff. Treated you as you would like to be treated yourself, pleasantry & respectful & smiley. Thank you to each & every one for making my stay the most memorable. I must cut down on the Blue Hawaiians though. In that heat they were so cool & went down way too well!! haha. There is a walkway next to Reception which takes you through to a few shops & an ABC store which was ideal for day to day purchasing of cold drinks, foods etc... A lovely (Swell) pool area & nice seating to relax in the sun if that is your cup of tea as we say :-) Cabanas are located here which can be hired out. As I was out being the crazy English tourist most days I never got the chance to sample this area but will endeavour to do so on my next visit.",,Bryanrobinsonputney,2,5.0

The lobby area is stunning & downstairs features a bar with a huge tropical fish tank. The pool area is bliss & the cocktails were amazing. The view from our room was spectacular. The location is across the road from the best swimming spot on Waikiki beach. The only disappointment we experienced were the breakfast boxes included in our package - the buffet breakfast should have been included. Also the air con was very cold so we had to sleep with the door open which was very noisy. I had a great experience at the spa - very good massage.

Stayed a couple of weeks at the renovated resort hotel. It’s interesting to read many reviews that all share similar experiences. There were many positive experiences, which were off-set by some of the challenges the resort faces if they want to truly be a top rated hotel.ProsThe staff made the difference. Any issue we had was taken care of, which we appreciated. Very helpful front desk, Renee, thank you. The pool side team, Nicky, Gabby and Rachel were fun to talk to. Great energy from the servers and poolside teams. Wade and Renee also provided breakfast coupons to take care of several issues early on.The location is great for walking around Waikiki and close to many restaurants, coffee shops, etc...Morimoto is fantastic! It is opposite Waikiki Beach, but you have to cross Kalakaua, this hotel is not directly on the ocean.The renovation of the hotel makes it one of the best in Waikiki. Other hotels need to follow their lead, as many of the big hotels are dated.The room cleaners were friendly and always had a smile on their faces. Food and drinks in the pool deck area was very good.ABC store on site is convenient Water bottle filling stations excellent idea and very popular with guests.Opportunities The rooms are good, but not great. As it was an old hotel and renovated, structural work remains the challenge. Noisy Generators from my first room, required me to get a room change, after my first night, which was appreciated. The 2nd room had a problem with the toilet and safe, but it got resolved quickly. The balcony doors are old and dirty. Many reviewers speak about the size of the washrooms. They are the smallest I have ever seen in any hotel I have stayed in. Not a lot of room at all. If that is important for you, be aware of it.The pool area is not well laid out, but it’s aesthetically lovely. Not enough loungers in the sun and as a result, people are having to lie on the sofas. The team should enforce the one hour rule to avoid people saving their chairs for hours and not being used. Instead of the expensive cabanas, they could open up the space more. The pool was very cold and unable to enjoy. Over the holidays, lots of families and little kids in the hot tub, which also wasn’t enjoyable. Internet in the pool deck area was very poor. As its part of the resort fee, management needs to get this fixed. The beachside tower ocean front over looks the homeless shelter area, which is out of the control of the hotel, but noise levels can get high at night as a result. Overall, the hotel management has a lot of work to do with the rooms and pool area to make it a great 5 star experience, if that is what they are advertising for and aiming to achieve. Perhaps they should stop trying to get awards and focus on what guests are saying. They are not the Ritz or Four Seasons. They are not Prince Hotel or Royal Hawaiian calibre. A hotel rated on TA as the around 25th best in the city isn’t worthy of Conde Nast awards. Continue to fix whats needed with the infrastructure and the items people are talking about.We were there for 16 nights and were thinking of leaving, early into our stay. I’m glad we stayed, but it was only a good experience, not great.","Toronto, Canada","159SharonR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",35,4.0

We were lucky to get a room on the 39th floor overlooking Diamondhead and Waikiki beach. It was incredible to watch the sunrise over the mountains from the porch each morning. The room was simple and clean--the view really made it special. The pool area was nicely done and a great spot to get a drink or some food, but there were a few downsides. Because of crowds, it was difficult to get a chair with a view of the pool or the water. Additionally, by the afternoon most of the pool area was shaded by the other buildings around the hotel. it made going in the pool a bit less appealing. Overall, we loved our stay here mostly due to the fabulous view from our room. It's a bit pricey, but that seems to be the case for most of the hotels in Waikiki.

This time we were given a partial ocean view room on the Diamond Head side of the building which isn't as good a view on the other side, so I have to admit to being a bit disappointed. But the room was a good size with plenty of storage, bed comfortable and the empty fridge was great. A chair of some sort in the room would have been good - it seemed strange not to have one as there was plenty of room for one and on reflection I should have asked for one. I always ask for a kettle and it took two calls to guest services to get one this time. The pool area is beautiful but it took me three attempts to get a sunlounger, so I ended up going to the beach instead for a couple of times. Finally on our last day I got smart and grabbed a sunlounger early. People were putting books or hats on sunloungers and then leaving the area - so that was annoying. The pool is mostly shaded by 3pm at this time of the year, so it's best to get in early if you want full sun. Overall it was a good stay, not sure I love it as much as I did in March, but the shine is wearing off the new renovation, so not sure how long the pristine white vibe is going to last here.","Auckland, New Zealand","flyok</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",76,4.0

There are plenty of places to eat nearby and lots of ABC stores (one inside hotel too). The beds at this hotel are extremely comfy! Our partial ocean view room was nice, and we even got a good view of Diamond Head. The room also came with an empty fridge which was awesome. Upon arrival, we had some chocolates in the room and some portable water bottles. One thing that I noticed was that there were not many counter tops to place your items. (Example - I stayed in a room with 2 queens. There was only one table in the middle of the two beds. The bathroom was pretty small, so there wasn't a lot of space to lay out all my belongings.)One huge complaint I had about this hotel was their unavailability over the phone.

A woman gave cpr and they found a heartbeat but who knows if the kid survived, it’s heartbreaking but the hotel needs to enforce the rules and the out of control kids need to be watched by parents.So overall, if you have kids this is a great place to stay, if you are looking for a couple getaway look elsewhere.","Brisbane, Australia","Brissy_Traveller1983</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",5,2.0

The hotel itself was very nice. The room was small but that is probably to be expected based on the Waikiki location. The reason I rated the hotel only 3 stars was because of the incompetency of the concierge desk. We stayed over New Years Eve and no one at the concierge desk or front desk could give us any information on New Year's Eve festivities at the hotel or Waikiki. We looked at the hotel website online and found there was music and drinks at the O'bar and also saw advertisements in the elevator. Why none of the staff was aware of this is questionable. We also found out from our waiter at a restaurant outside of the hotel that there would be fireworks on the beach. Again, the hotel staff did not share this with us. In addition, we asked at the concierge desk about activities and hiking in Oahu. The only advice we were given was pamphlets on a luau (which we told them we had no interest in) and whale watching. They also kept trying to tell us about restaurant deals when we never asked for restaurant advice. When we called the whale watching company, we were informed that they had not started whale watching tours yet and did not expect to do so for at least another week. When we asked about hiking at Diamond Head and if parking would be available, we were told parking would not be an issue. The parking lot was full when we arrived and we had to leave and park somewhere else. The concierge staff also were not able to give us information about any other hikes. Again, the waiter at the outside restaurant was helpful with many other suggestions. The fact that a waiter was much more helpful to us than the multiple different concierge members we spoke to at the hotel is very disappointing. On a separate note, we had a food allergy issue at one of the restaurants we ate at in the hotel, Morimoto Asia. We had informed our waiter of our son's multiple food allergies which included sesame seeds. He assured us that the food we ordered would not contain these items. The dumplings came out with sesame seeds on top. Luckily, my son noticed and did not eat them. We informed our waiter and other then him seeming to be confused, he did not give us any other response. I am not sure what the relationship between the restaurant and hotel is but since it is on hotel property, I am including this in my review. Overall, I would NOT stay at the Alohilani again given the wide options in Waikiki. I would expect more from a hotel in this price range.","Vienna, Virginia","naya72</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vienna, Virginia</strong>",6,3.0

The room itself was very neatly appointed, roomy with a large TV, compact ensuite and plenty of storage for our bags and things.There is a travel agent-bookings desk downstairs-they were very helpful and honest about activities to do for us to get the most out of our holiday.The hotel itself is very central, a block away from the Dukes statue-where there is a bus stop for the tourist trolley's right next to the beach and bath areas. Restaurants and bars everywhere, walking distance to everything in the Waikiki beach front area.The food in the restaurant/bar area was not very good and way overpriced. Breakfast box unappetising apart from the fruit. Coffee machine in the room was a nice touch and coffee not too bad either.The bar at the pool was the same. The bar tender was swearing with some of the lads at the bar-very unprofessional and inappropriate Chad.The pool area is lovely. The cabanas looked perfect was very expensive to hire, and I didn't quite understand why you had to hire pool lounges in the pool itself.

It’s BEAUTIFUL! The rooms are a decent size, the bed is amazing, the lobby is super nice, the bars aren’t bad, we haven’t eaten at the restaurant yet but it’s by Morimoto so I’m sure it’s good. There are two pools and a hot tub. (This is gonna be where my bias comes into play). One of those pools is a kiddie pool. For kids!! The other is a regular pool which, sure, has a ton of kids in it. however, most of the children have been in the hot tub. Like, A LOT! With floaties on and climbing around the walls of it, which by the way just drops off, infinity pool style to a shallow moat-like area. Kinda dangerous. And when I say kids they range in age from a few months to maybe like 10. I’ve counted at least two a day (the same family I think) kids who are visibly wearing diapers NONE of which should be allowed in a hot tub for any amount of time let alone the hours that they are in there for. Not even grown people should really stay in one for longer than 30 min or so, but the adults in there, perhaps parents, perhaps not didn’t seem to care. And why would they when you can have your cocktail in a glass container in said hot tub. Again, drunk adults, glass, hot tubs and kids don’t mix well. And mind you the hot tub isn’t huge and there’s been an average of about 15 adults and kids in there at one time. It would be one thing if there was no kiddie pool, but there is. And not one kid has been in it. This may be a family resort but if your family doesn’t include an out of control child, you shouldn’t have to deal with someone else’s when all you want to do is relax. The staff doesn’t seem to care about any of this. In fact they just offer to take pictures of them. So if you have kids and you like for them to simmer away in murky hot water with about 20 other humans then book your stay now, otherwise I suggest an all adults place where biggest worry you will have is if people can handle their piña coladas.

Suite is beautifully appointed, modern and clean. A partial ocean view mean you see a bit of the ocean between 2 buildings in front of you. Suite 3959 and 3955 are rooms on the very top 39 floor. Our first night there it was really windy and our balcony glass doors were banging from the wind. And on top of that there was this loud rumbling sound from the roof we thought caused by the wind as well. If you know teenagers they sleep through anything but it was so noisy even they could not sleep. Next morning, I asked to be moved but manager on duty said there was no other suites available but they will get someone to look at the doors. I though ok maybe I’ll just have to get earplugs. During the afternoon we were resting in the room and the rumbling from the roof was so noisy it sounded like we were riding on a train and I’m not exaggerating. I texted the manager and Jill called us back. We ended up downgrading from our suite to a regular room since no suites were available. Jill was very understanding and did not charge us for the first night as we got absolutely no sleep. I’m sad we had to give up the space and the luxury that came with the suite but it is definitively quiet now. No wind. No rumbling. I want to acknowledge that Jill stepped up and made our pretty horrible situation to a decent one. I wanted to give more stars but can’t due to the lack any greeting and direction from the front desk Japanese guy when we checked in. I didn’t get his name but he should not be working at the front desk. Also disappointed the first manager we spoke to did not offer any remedy. So my advice, don’t stay in the partial ocean view suites or rooms on the 39th floor until they have fixed the old balcony door and address whatever is making that noise on the roof.

There’s no room service which is odd because every 5 star hotel has room service. I waited almost 20 minutes for my food at the pool bar and by the time I got my food my fries were cold. To be fair I was compensated for my inconvenience but I should have not waited that long for steak and fries. The only upside of this hotel is the staff. I was greeted with a friendly smile by Doug one of the valet staff and had a very friendly, smooth check in process with the supervisor Chanel.

The best part of the pool was the woman who greeted us and set us up. Super enthused and helpful. We ate there and the food was fine... not great. For the 800 bucks the room was i'm not sure i'd stay for a long stay at the 'Alohilani. Why?

They should charge us the self-parking only instead of the valet parking. If you can check the pictures I uploaded for this review, you can see they charged us the valet parking from our hotel check in date: Dec 18th (which we haven't got a car yet). When I asked them for the parking ticket, they never explained to me the difference between guest self-parking and valet parking. After we came back, I sent several emails as well as making long distance calls to their manager and staffs, they just simply and rudely replied me that their record showed we used the valet parking.

The rooftop bar is beautiful and filled with comfortable seating options from couches to fire pit tables and great music!The infinity pool is beautiful but very very small and FILLED with small children splashing and screaming. I recommend an age limit of any kids under 10 should stay in the kid area. For us, it’s fine because we have kids and get it, but wouldn’t recommend this place for couples. Another question, why are the beautiful cabanas not next to the pool? They are on the opposite side of the rooftop?The location of the hotel is great, but the elevators take forever. So don’t call an Uber until you’re in the lobby.

The room was very clean and was very well tended to by the excellent staff. The check in process was smooth and easy the staff was very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is right in the mix of the things, the beach is literally across the street. There is also plenty of shopping and dining options nearby.

The pool was lovely, rooms were nicely laid out and very clean. However, we did have some poor experiences which dampened the overall view of our stay. I had requested a high floor room with an ocean view. I understand that this was subject to availability, but we were only allocated a room on the 7th floor (out of 17) and it was right down the end of the hotel, above the pool. So there was a view, but it was only a sliver/side view once we stood on the balcony, and it was extremely noisy being that close to the pool. We could hear the outdoor music blaring through the wall all day and night. To be honest, I feel we were allocated one of the worst rooms purely due to the fact that we had booked through Expedia and got a cheap room rate. They offered us an upgrade to an ocean front room for $130 a night but I thought that was a bit ridiculous, so declined. The noise we experienced as part of our stay here was probably the worst we have endured in any of our trips to Hawaii. We usually stay in resorts right on the beach (eg. Outrigger, Sheraton) with no side road next to it, and boy what a difference this made. The road noise was ridiculous, even from the 7th floor we could hear so much. They have done a terrible job of soundproofing as it is an older hotel that has been renovated. With our door closed we could hear the splashing of the pool, people in the pool, the pool music, not to mention the people in the hallway or the rooms next door. We heard them coughing and sneezing, so loud it sounded like they were in our room. So needless to say, we had a terrible sleep. I had to resort to playing a white noise app on my phone to try and help. The most frustrating part was them trying to charge us for the complimentary mai tais on check out. I am glad my husband checked the bill carefully or we wouldn’t have noticed!! They refunded this charge but then also took a $400 credit card authorisation for a reason unknown. This maxed out my credit card at the end of a long (and expensive) trip to Hawaii leaving us almost stranded and unable to pay for our onward accomodation in Sydney. I was pretty distressed about this and tried to call them from the airport to enquire what had happened, but was just on hold for ages and couldn’t get through to anyone. I need to contact them to resolve this if it does not reverse in the next few days. It was a really frustrating way to end our stay and definitely left a bad taste in our mouths. It was certainly a nice hotel but due to our overall experience, I am not sure we would return. ",Sunshine Coast,"TiffanyDi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunshine Coast</strong>",93,3.0

Also, when you have someone call the room to tell us there is a welcome package available, it is nice to actually have a welcome package and not a salesman trying to sell you all the crappy tour around the island so he can get his bonus. Not a welcome package. Finally, the pool is almost always in the shadow. We arrived at 1:30pm. The only place that was still in the sun were the sofas.

We had 3 free drinks for our hotel stay and had a relaxing time at the lobby cafe. One can feel the hustle and bustle of Waikiki at this hotel as it is always crowded at all times. The downside is that the hotel does not provide amenities such as toothbrush, toothpaste and we have to grab them from the ABC store at the ground floor. The ocean view is also a little disappointing as we only get to see the ocean by looking out from the right side of the balcony. Other than that, we had a great time staying at Alohilani!

Beautiful entry and foyer plus stylish bars and restaurants plus the huge aquarium. From the time we arrived during the very early morning the staff were wonderful. They gave us an early check-in to our room on the 32nd floor with a view of Diamond Head and the ocean, it doesn't get better than that. The room was tastefully decorated and fitted out. It had a pod coffee machine (not a great fan of the coffee though, but we are fussy Australians when it come to coffee). The only fault, if I am to make one, is the lack of a kettle and toaster, but it's certainly not a deal breaker.Location is superb. Walk out of the lobby and you're at the beach. It's far enough away from the bustling middle of Waikiki, yet on a few minutes walk to it. Perfect on both counts.The pool area is fabulous with an infinity pool plus another pool for children. There is plenty of lounging area plus the bar and it's seating. There are also cabanas you can hire for that perfect relaxing environment.There is free wifi, which in my opinion is a must these days (any hotel that charges you for wifi are ripping you off)There is an ABC store in the hotel for all your needs plus the famed Morimoto Asia restaurant and it's cheaper sibling Mosoman. Both were delicious. Our check-out was in the early hours of the morning (4am) and again the reception staff was terrific and the Concierge was very helpful weighing our luggage for us (we had to double check after our extra purchases during our holiday that we didn't exceed our limit).All in all I would thoroughly recommend the Alohilani and we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.","Melbourne, Australia","coops52</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",33,5.0

The daily resort fees means you can take as many beach towel as you need either for the pool or down to the beach just across the road. Also having a laundry onsite is a great convenience for the hotel guests.As for the negatives unfortunately there are many -1. No room service. For a 5 star hotel we are absolutely astounded by this.2. Bathroom amenities - no shower caps nor q-tips. This may be a tiny thing but other 4 star hotels supply this as standard. This comes across as stingy and mean from a hotel who is charging a lot of money.3. Attention to detail part 1 - we tipped housekeeping well each day but had to ask for shampoo and conditioner twice during our 6 day stay.4. Attention to detail part 2 - there was no service/info book in the room. We had no idea what facilities was available in the hotel as there was no information in the room. No idea where the fitness club was, which floor was the pool deck. what time is breakfast being served, where is the laundry? NOTHING.. You had to ring the front desk each time you have a question.. not very satisfactory nor efficient. 5. Staff engagement seems low - other than the pool staff and the front desk, they don't seem to be too happy to greet guests. Perhaps they are a bit over-worked?6. Breakfast quality and choice was poor - we did have breakfast one morning with two free vouchers. If we had this as an added extra to our daily room rate we would not have been very happy. One of the most unimaginative unexciting buffet breakfast we have ever experienced in a 5-star hotel. Again all the serving staff was so glum and non-friendly it was just sad.7. This is a big one and I have left it till the very end. I visited the hotel concierge desk to enquire about renting a car and obtaining a few day tour information and while the staff member was looking up the info to give me a quote another member of staff injected himself into the conversation and started to offer me discounted rates to any of the tour bookings if I would spend some time attending a session and listen to a presentation on other available resorts and their offerings - ie ""other timeshare apartment/hotels""!!! Basically this man was trying to use this hotel to sell other timeshare deals. I can tell the original staff member was not happy nor comfortable with this and he did not engage at all with the second man. I have never been in a high-end hotel where they would allow this to cheapen the entire customer experience. I was so shocked and surprised I never returned to the concierge desk again. This is such a shame as we were warned about these time-share discount deals on the street of Waikiki but we never expected to have to deal with in our own hotel by one of their own staff!Overall - we did love our room and the hotel is beautiful. We just wish they spend some time fixing the little things and it would be just a magical place to be.","Melbourne, Australia","Salyt141</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",32,3.0

They delivered a beautiful fruit platter, bubbles and two monogrammed Bubbly glasses which we were told we could keep as a momento of the holiday, The staff were lovely, the pool area was classy and a great spot to watch the sunset.

The bathroom was rather compact but clean and perfectly adequate. I wouldn't say luxurious but a really comfortable stay, well positioned and very clean.

They did try to add a resort fee at reception but I argued that we had paid that as part of our deal because that is what I was told when I booked. It was all inclusive.

I prefer hotels/resorts with unique personality/ambiance & tend to stay away from the major hotel chains. Waikiki in particular seems overrun by these mega-properties, most of which have been there for years and some of which look quite dated. I was excited to find the Alohilani & learn that it was recently renovated. Almost everything was top notch. The service was great all around. Jane, who checked us in, diligently searched to find us the best room available (and managed a free upgrade on room type). Everyone at the pool (and pool bar) provided great service, offering us extra towels or anything else we might need. Even the staff we would pass in the lobby, halls or elevators were very friendly and offering of assistance. The room was of good size, the beds were comfortable, the amenities nice (big tv, mini fridge, plenty of toiletries, Keurig coffee, etc.). Our view, a Diamond Head Overview on the 28th floor was spectacular. The hotel lobby was pretty spectacular. Location also very ideal; close to everything but just far enough from the craziness of central WaikikiHaving said all the good, I want to add a few caveats (not really negatives, just things to be aware of). The hotel bills itself as a 5*, which is quite a stretch. No turn down service, no room service, no mini bar, paper cups (not ceramic mugs) for coffee. There was also a general lack of information/documentation in the rooms. Where is the ice machine? Where do I get water for the flasks? Pool hours? Schedule of activities? None of this information was provided. Much of it was on signage near elevators & such but when you are hauling suitcases at check in you aren't exactly catching all those details. There should at least be a binder of services in the rooms. These things don't really matter much to me but should be noted.One other consideration worth mentioning is the room categories. As many others have pointed out, these can be a little deceptive. ""Ocean View"" rooms are on the sides of the building(s) pointing toward the city with the ocean visible at an angle. ""Ocean Front"" rooms, of which there are very few, are the only rooms directly facing the ocean & the rates for those rooms are substantially higher. We were fortunate to get a good room with a good view on a higher floor. Overall, we loved our stay & would definitely stay there again.

Impressive entrance and lobby gets you in the right vacation mindset. Front desk staff is welcoming and quickly checked us into the hotel. The ocean view rooms were spacious and clean with a lanai that provided a partially obstructed view of the beach/ocean. The walls are a bit thin and conversations in the adjacent room can be easily heard, but the large comfortable bed and large LCD TV made it a perfect place to get some rest after a long day shopping, exploring, or laying out at the beach or pool. The pool area was a bit crowded so get their early for the loungers, it is likely the nicest in Waikiki with a large inifinti pool, hot tub, and kids pool. The fitness center is actually a membership club with great with modern equipment and machines. The location is great, a short walk to the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and plenty of options nearby to shop or eat. Traffic can be bad but its location helps to avoid some of those problems being on the southern end near the zoo (which also has some cheaper or free parking options).Areas of improvement, guest services was difficult to reach from the room and many bathroom amenities were available only on request. I had a rude encounter with the Bell Desk who was visibility annoyed with an inquiry. I ended up asking the neighboring Hyatt Regency Bell Desk for the same information. A great option but with so many options at that price point, I am likely to try others the next time I visit given the issues I encountered with Guest Services and thin walls.","San Francisco, California","ROY L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",22,4.0

With business travel I usually try and use points but this was worth it!!!!!! The rooms are so spacious and modern for Waikiki and I got a complimentary upgrade to ocean view room upon check in which was an incredible surprise, the free mai tai vouchers at check in were a great touch as well. I visited the pool deck one day and Nikki was INCREDIBLE, she made sure our experience was anything but ordinary. We had the perfect pool day, insane views from the pool deck and such amazing hospitality from Nikki and team. The pool menu for food and drink did not disappoint either! I also wanted to mention the location!!!!! Insane views of the ocean/Diamond Head depending on where you are. 30 second walk to the beach or a few minutes walking to anywhere in Waikiki. I also loved momosan and morimoto right on hotel property, they were delicious and soooo convenient. I am anxiously awaiting my next business stay here in this modern chic hotel and can’t wait to see Nikki again at the pool!!! I love the Alohilani!

After this was escalated to the duty managers on 3 occassions - after nothing was done about the behaviour I asked to see the hotel manager - he never attempted contact. The food & beverage manager offered us a complimentary cabana on our last day however we were made to feel so uncomfortable we declined. We stayed on the 10th floor which flooded and were moved after quite a while to the 15th floor of the front building. This was after an unsatisfactory room was offered a room in the back building, which had noisy aircon and not as nice. My silk dresses were water damaged however the hotel had them drycleaned (on checking the bill they charged me but upon me asking they promptly removed the charge). The hotel holds significant funds against your credit card and only releases them after 2-3 weeks - be warned. The managers who were pleasant but lacked leadership and competency. Be careful not to stay on the 5th floor as this is where the entry to the pool area is and would be very noisy plus smelled damp. The food at the O Bar and service was great.

I know that cost of labour, materials and goods are are a few reason why but with over 9 million people visiting the Hawaiian islands every year I’m always surprised at this. Last week my partner and I visited Waikiki and were pleasantly surprised by a gamble we took on a booking a newly renovated hotel called ‘Alohilani Resort Waikiki Beach (formerly Pacific Beach Hotel). Upon arrival we were immediately impressed with the extensive addition/renovations of exterior of the property. Urban, contemporary and chic are a few adjectives that come to mind. The hotel now looking more like W or Modern hotel nestled in the Hollywood hills than its predecessor Pacific Beach. As you drive into the vestibule you’re met with Aloha spirit valets and bellmen all offering top notch service but with that casual Hawaiian hospitality that immediately makes you feel welcome - Ohana style(family). From there you enter giant wood doors into a sweeping, spacious and contemporary lobby where you’re greeted by amazing staff at the front desk. The MOD Amy who was helping another guest overheard our check in and recognized my voice from a call I placed to her the night before, requesting a higher floor and room that had a diamond head and ocean view. Not only did Amy deliver on her promise of a great view but graciously upgraded my partner and I to a Diamond Head Seascape Corner room suite with a breathtaking view on the 25th floor(2566 to be exact) - thank you Amy! This was high touch service at its finest! The room was very well appointed in a modern yet Hawaiian style that included an updated bathroom, contemporary furniture, crisp white linens, comfy bed, fluffy pillows, modern LED flat screen, Kurig coffee maker, recyclable water bottles, amazing sitting areas and a lanai with a view to die for! Let’s talk about the pool, pool deck and bar. I want to give this a 10/10 but the only drawback is that the infinity pool was freezing cold. We were informed by pool deck staff that the heating pump wasn’t working properly and that they were working on a solution to fix it. Nonetheless we ended up at the beach each day as the ocean water was much warmer and enjoyable. Had the pool been warmer, we would’ve gladly stayed and ordered cocktails all day long! The layout of the pool deck is reminiscent of something you’d find in Los Angeles or Miami and includes high quality loungers, lounge chair covers, towels, fruit infused water etc. Secondly(and I’m hoping this is something they decide to reenforce) that there are no minors under 18 allowed into the infinity pool or jacuzzi. Before you comment on this, please know that there is a children’s pool just steps away that I sincerely feel should be kept for minors only. If your a gym/fitness lover, this hotel is for you! One of the perks included in your daily resort fees is for the Island Club and Spa. The equipment and space is truly like a smaller version of equinox! I give this a 10/10Now for the restaurants. Truth be told, we had every intention of trying both but unfortunately never did make it to either although we did hear from other guests that we made friends with and from other locals that both Momosan and Morimoto both amazing! Perhaps a guest incentive like a 20% off on your first visit would be a motivator. We did however have a few snacks poolside from swell bar which were all clever and tasty! Finally at time of check out we provided some constructive feedback over our concern for the cold temperature of the infinity pool as well a few housekeeping things(halls and rooms not being vacuumed throughout week) and our checkout agent quickly and sincerely apologized and offered to take care of the resort fees(which we didn’t even ask for). We were surprised and delighted by this gesture as we did end up paying a $50 day fee to rent chairs and umbrellas at the beach each day, and felt very compensated! Overall our stay was highly enjoyable and will definitely return to this property!  ","Vancouver, Canada","Vanman70</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",3,5.0

They have plenty of things to do there for guests. Lei flower making, infinity pool, jacuzzi, movie under the sky while lounging or swimming in keiki pool. Decent price foods and drinks in the bar makes it an excellent choice for tourists. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. They provides free Mai Tai upon check in.

Parking for government rate includes 50% off making the cost only $15 a day which I must say is another excellent gesture by the hotel. Rooms have keurig coffee/green tea maker which is an added plus. The lobby were incredible in my opinion. It's hard to explain until you actually see it for yourself. However, I can almost assure you that you will not regret your stay there. Even Hilton hotel doesn't match to this hotel in my opinion based on my recent stay with them prior of coming to this hotel.

The view did not disappoint. Had a great view of the ocean from the balcony-perfect for watching the sunrise. Do note that the pool is on the 5th floor so if your rooms are close by, the music from the pool will not be a relaxing experience for you. The bathtub drainage could use some work but otherwise the bathroom is clean-their soaps are luxurious and the sizes do not disappoint. Some guests don't know how to be courteous and will let doors slam-that can get annoying, especially when such behavior is accompanied by wine-loving cruise-ship ladies. Also, the doors have a bit of a gap so lot of noise enters from and to hallway. You need to request slippers-they're so soft and fluffy. Wish they had a robe... I usually have back pain when I sleep but during my entire time at Alohilani, I never had any back issues. I slept like a corpse-very relaxing!Pool-If you're coming from the Beach Tower, get off at 5th floor and go through the door marked ""Exit"". That's how you can get to the pool without having to go through the lobby to get to the pool through the other tower. This is also where you go to pick-up towels to use at the beach.Hotel: Cross the street, the beach is there. Love the lagoon-like walls-keeps excess waves out and it's very non-swimmer/kid friendly. The water's clear and clean enough you'll see some fish here and there (I've had better luck here than trying to find fish at Hanauma). Eats: Plenty of eateries nearby. Eggs n Things is over-hyped, not worth the wait. Go to Cheeseburger in Paradise for cheaper breakfast deal. Isayuma Musubi is nearby as well for a quick bite. Momosan Waikiki's ramen is better than what I expected-it's not the most authentic Japanese ramen but it is enough for my very-American palate.Staff: Everyone is amazing. I had put in note that I was here for my birthday weekend. They had chocolate-covered strawberries and wine delivered to my room with personal note. Whatever requests I had, the housekeeping attend to it within minutes. Front desk is always friendly and helpful. Utilize the Concierge services. I wanted to horseback ride but the one I tried to book was already packed. The Concierge introduced to me a lesser-known program and was able to book a slot for me, all in less than 10 minutes.

However, Regent was right on top of things and changed hotels for us when they discovered some Waikiki hotels were just hit with a massive labor strike and the Royal was included. They weren't exaggerating either--- Wow, one group was in front of the Westin Moana Surfrider and they must have numbered over 200. These folks are pretty rhythmic, so with real drums, plastic 5 gallon gas jugs and other makeshift musical instruments they really do a job. Particularly when some of them lead a chant or singing. You know you are getting close to the action blocks away.So Regent had gotten us into a very nice waterfront hotel that was not on strike. Good on them. This hotel, the Alohilani Resort. We ported in Honolulu just before dawn, so we got to the resort very early in the morning because these cruise lines usually like to kick you off the ship as soon as possible to make room for the new load coming on board before noon. But we were fortunate in that the Alohilani said they could put us in a room right then, however, if we wanted to wait some time in the lobby they could find a better view for us. Hey, we took them up on the right now offer and certainly couldn't complain. Nice sized balcony, looking right at Diamond Head not that far away and lots of ocean view to the right. So the rays of the setting sun were right on Diamond Head which is pretty colorful that time of day. The Alohilani has recently been greatly refurbished with a name change and all. It is very clean, modern, quiet, with a staff that certainly is very friendly and very accommodating in every way. The room itself was about average size for a high end hotel, and the bathroom was mediocre. Air conditioner took a little getting used to but it was okay. Beds were super. The buffet breakfast was complimentary under the package we had, however, it was a full hot breakfast and perhaps the best prepared we ever had in a hotel. The T.V. was huge with a large selection of channels including our favorite news channel MSNBC. A year ago we got stuck in a La Quinta Hotel in Boulder, Colorado that didn't have MSNBC, I wrote to them about it and they said they would take in ""under advisement"" LOL. The Alohilani and complex is adjacent to Kalakaua Avenue which is adjacent to Waikiki Beach. We enjoyed the first day at the hotel but on the second day our flight didn't leave until shortly after 10:00 PM. Check out time was 11:00 AM. I went down to the desk to discuss this, believing we could maybe negotiate a few hours more in the room. Fortunately, they have a rate structure which allows a lot more, $30.00 per hour or $60.00 until three in the afternoon, or $100.00 until six in the evening. We took the six, giving us two entire days in the hotel and on Waikiki. Only hotel I've ever ran into this lenient. The lobby is large and modern with a huge two story aquarium that has windows all over the place. I actually felt pretty sad having to leave this hotel and Hawaii. We would have stayed longer but had to get back home and get ready for another cruise. Hope we get an opportunity to return to the Alohilani.

The Hotel turns the bar into a light breakfast eating place if you prefer to eat in.During our stay, there were three very loud protests at each of the Sheratan Hotels which were in the heart of Waikikiki Beach well out of earshot of the Alohilani.

We arrived on a wet, rainy day close to noon time. While we understand that check in time is at 3pm- which is quite late by international standards- they could have extended a bit of courtesy. There were no available seats in the lounge (because it was raining, I guess), we were told we’d have to order something to sit at the bar, they had no umbrellas they could let us use. We had to walk out in the rain to get lunch while waiting to check in. No suggestions on where we could get lunch without getting wet. Got back at 1:30 (wet and tired) and there was still no room. Girl at the check in counter rolled her eyes as I asked once again if we could finally check in. For a pricey, supposedly upscale resort, they don’t offer anything beyond what you pay for. Very basic bath amenities (no shower cap, no bathrobe), no courtesy bottle of water (they give refillable containers but you have to get water on the ground floor), no umbrellas (it does rain in Hawaii too).","San Juan, Philippines","annetteve</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Juan, Philippines</strong>",5,2.0

Alohilani Resort was the exception with a newly completed refurbishment and a host of resort features that really appealed to us. Upon arrival our expectations were well and truly met. The staff were welcoming, the lobby was stunning with the coral artwork backdrop, and the decor and styling delivered a dreamy yet sophisticated beach vibe.Our ocean view room was decently sized, clean, well presented and comfortable. The great decor styling from the hotels main areas were also reflected in the room. Our balcony delivered a breathtaking view of the water and our king bed was very comfortable. We did notice that the rooms facing Diamond Head seemed undesirable and basically overlooked a carpark so highly recommend you pay the extra to book an ocean view or ocean facing room to reap the rewards of the outlook and cool sea breezes. Alohilani Resort is perfectly located with easy access to the beach, esplanade shopping and dining and walking paths. The ABC Store downstairs was very convenient and we opted to dine at Morimoto Restaurant located at the front of the hotel on many occasions during our stay. The pool area although beautiful, was always crowded and we found the swimming pool overrun with too many children. We did enjoy having Swell Bar by the pool and recommend the fish tacos from the menu. To note, you will need to wait awhile for service though as many (not all) staff seemed to be busy doing not much. In the late afternoon, you can take a seat in the outdoor lounge area with the sunset dropping in the background and live acoustic music playing - the perfect setting to end your day in the sun. As a final note, we stayed during Hurricane Lane and were highly appreciative of the efforts that Alohilani Resort's management and staff delivered during this period. We were kept well informed on weather updates and the team generally did their best to make the stay as enjoyable as possible given that we were advised not to leave the hotel for two days.

There are chairs and umbrellas that you can hire so no problem there ($25 for two hours). However quite a few people live in the adjacent park and are very noisy at night screaming etc. so we didn’t sleep well despite the bed being super comfy. The air conditioning despite being new is odd and quite noisy. Most staff are polite and helpful but checkin was awful with huge queues and stern staff. Needs resolving ASAP. Would I stay here again?

If check in staff do not want to provide you with this information, there needs to be information packs in your room. The lifts do have screens with some of this information but quite often the lifts are very crowded and you cannot see the screens.The breakfast buffet is ridiculously priced for what it is (US$35). We either ate at restaurants outside or bought some things from the ABC store and had it in our room.In the 10 days we were there, the pool area was hired out for 4 separate events which meant we could not use it. This is not acceptable to paying guests especially when you are charging such a high ""resort"" fee.Too many unsupervised kids in the infinity pool. Perhaps make the infinity pool adults only?While booking some tours one afternoon, one of your staff was trying to sell us, what I can only assume, was some sort of ""time share"" where we could attend a ""meeting"" for an hour and we could get a discount on our tours. Again, totally unacceptable!! We wanted to catch The Bus to Diamond Head one morning and on another day, to Pearl Harbour. Not one person on your tour desk could tell us what number bus we had to get or where to get it from.Perhaps in the future, if people can't use the pool and would like to go to the beach, you could provide fold up chairs and/or umbrellas as part of your ""resort"" fee? I'm sure guests would have no issue with paying a refundable bond on the return of their chairs/umbrella?

It’s recently been reopened. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would return. There are two towers - the beach front one (which we stayed in) goes to 17 floors. The back tower (with pool in between the towers) goes to approximately 39 floors (this tower has gym facilities in it and a great gym). I’m going to rate this hotel on pros and cons:Pros:Tower 1 (beach side room 1501) had amazing views to beach and pool. Across the road from the beach. Room was clean, spacious. Daily clean. Amazingly comfortable bed and pillows. Pool was great to have but had many cons. Fabulous to have a water fountain to fill your bottle up continuously. Hotel gives you water pouches. ABC store in the Hotel. Superb location. Well equipped gym. The bathroom has a bidet. Decor is light and tasteful. Cons:Shower pressure was weak. Paper thin walls - could hear Neighbours talking, kids crying, their TV and dryer. Air Conditioning is noisy and you can’t control it - so it was either too hot or too cold. Pool area was great but many times hired out for private events e.g. two weddings and a Gay Pride party, which meant - no seats, no umbrellas and slow waiter service. It was also a very windy area hence we spent a lot of time in the beach. Another drawback for this area was they hired out Cabanas for $175 for two hours (could have been more) and they were hardly ever occupied. Plus pool side loungers could be hired and they were not occupied all the time either. Yet when they restricted the area due to events- guests were still not allowed to occupy these areas. Balcony doors old and hard to open. As far as price goes - it’s not the top but close.

Who wants to listen to Calvis Harris nonstop for hours on end? Only on one day was it suitable for a light BPM music you could relax or drink to.2) Pool Hours - We has a beachside room (aka facing the side street and on the corner viewing the pool. Still ocean view however). We had to put our A/C on high to drown out the music playing to 12am and kids making noise up to the same time. We would have been fine with a 11pm music cutoff time and a 11:30pm pool closing time. It doesn't look like they enforce those policies at all.3) Pride Week Kickoff Party - I had no problem with the event but there was NO, ZERO notification in our stay that this was happening. There were people who bought access to the pool with a pink bracelet but those party goers were not staying at the hotel. They had no privilege to taking over chairs reserved for guests only.4) Eating at the O-BAR - We went down for a small bite to eat and a beer. We're greeted and then given menus. Everything seemed fine as we were the only two people eating or at the bar. When we finished, we couldn't find our waitress for more than 10 minutes. Additionally the bar manager looked less interested than turning his back away from the bar and taking care of our bill. Seemed like our waitress went to the back to probably be on her phone. Other than that, towels and sheets were routinely changed and fresh.

The pool is a little small for the size of the hotel and I do believe management should review the process of having to pay additional money for the sunbeds in the pool – as often these were the only ones available. The main pool should also be made child free - its extremely dangerous with children in it. Upon check in, we clearly advised we wanted to pay for our incidentals with our travel card (to avoid horrendous bank fees/ exchange rates), regardless of us advising this, the reception team took the money from our credit card meaning we occurred bank fees etc (which is what we didn’t want). Upon check out the lady was apologetic and advised we would get refunded the full amount including the bank fees etc. It has now been 3 weeks and over 5 emails have been sent and I haven’t received the money back.

After checking in and seeing the room, I went straight downstairs to the lobby and extended our stay for the full trip. The whole hotel has been re-styled, and it looks super good. The rooms are modern and large. Most hotels in Waikiki are slightly outdated - I think 'Alohilani is probably the most contemporary hotel on the beach (the Ritz is great, but much more expensive and not on the beach itself. There's also Trump hotel, but I'd rather punch myself in the face than stay there). We had a corner room in the rear tower, which gave great views of the city and beach. The front tower would have even better views. It was super affordable relative to other places. The pool area is large and really nice. The foyer is also pretty spectacular. Staff are super friendly and helpful. There were just a couple of cons: The bathrooms are really small. For us, it didn't really matter - but some travellers might object. We had dinner one night at the pool, and after sitting and waiting for service for a few minutes I ordered at the bar. The guy behind the bar looked a little uneasy, and I found we got daggers from the waitress who's area we were sitting in for the rest of the night (I'm assuming because we wouldn't be tipping her). This might be an American peculiarity, but it's a bit tedious for Australians. Minor objections, though; for the price, and the location, this modern hotel is very hard to beat. 100% recommended.",Brisbane,"LittleWingBrisbane</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane</strong>",14,5.0

Also the noise from the street is very loud, as the rooms do not have sound proof doors. Lastly and most concerning, during our stay another hotel guest suffered a serious medical episode by the pool and not one of the staff working on the pool deck (pool attendants, wait staff, bar staff etc) were trained as first responders. The guest required immediate help and it was up to other hotel guests to provide assistance as the staff stood around and watched. It wasn’t until some of the hotel-trained first responders arrived that anything was really done by the hotel staff.

Approached the concierge and they told us to liaise with the shuttle transportation at the lobby. We reached the guy around 12:30pm and he told us we were quite lucky as the last shuttle out was at 12:45pm. He took down our names and when he called the driver, he told us that the bus was full and didn’t have any spot on for us. He later on advised us to proceed to the concierge for other options.We were attended by Ms Allison at the concierge but she was not so knowledgeable on this transportation stuff and told us she will refer us to her colleague Mr Yuki who was just two tables away. When we approached him, he was so unhelpful, rude and sarcastic. He just snubbed us off by telling us that he has got nothing to do with transportation and told us to refer back to the guys at the lobby. I even noticed Allison looking on at us in dissatisfaction about this rude Mr Yuki’s response to us. Having a rude and not helpful staff like this really tarnishes the image of this wonderful hotel. I come from the airline industry and having people like him in the service or customer industry was TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. I did not know if he was being like that because we were Asians but noticed him attending to the rest non Asian guests so friendly. Furthermore he snubbed us in front of other guests in the concierge. I should say it was his good day because I was getting angry and wanted to fire him off on the face but my wife stopped me. We got so mad and decided to have breakfast first. At the restaurant we met an elderly friendly Hawaiian couple and they advised us where else to shop if we could not go to Waikele. I went back to the concierge again to have a word with Yuki regarding what happened earlier as I was still not satisfied by his cheap treatment but I think his lucky star was out that morning and he was not there. I was then attended by the awsome Mr Jacob a.k.a Mr Jay. He was totally the opposite of Yuki. It’s like meeting gold(Jay) instead of garbage(Yuki). He apologized for his colleague’s treatment on us and went all out to help us. He called up a few transportation companies and tried to slot us in while still entertaining us with his charisma and jokes. But unfortunately all were full and then he told us we can either take a cab which will cause a bomb or public bus which we decided not to as we wanted to do a lot of shopping. Even Allison came over and spoke to us stating she didn’t like and disagree with the way Yuki handled us and apologized as well. Though we were disappointed, we were still happy and decided to use an Uber to and back from Waikele.Just like to highlight to Alohilani management to employ more professional, friendly and unbiased staffs like Jay and Allison instead of sarcastic useless ones like Yuki. I believe this hotel caters for a lot of tourist from Asia, the place we are from as we are paying equally the same as the other non Asian tourists and demand to be treated the same too. If without us, the hotel won’t have business. So our humble request is please up your standards on this and reward or appreciate Jay and Allison for their help and understanding. Besides this, all the other staffs in this hotel treated us nicely.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","LloydAdrian23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong>",3,1.0

Was told that the bar area in the pool is open until midnight, so drink on! Cabana's looked nice but I am sure they charge an additonal fee to use. The best feature about the pool area is that they give you beach towels you can take to the beach and bring back after you're done by leaving them in your room, that was sort of cool. I think the main reason I initially booked was due to the location and it really did not disappoint. The beach is across the street with restaurants, shops and high-end stores all in walking distance. The most important, of course, it the ABC store downstairs that has everything under the moon. Food, drinks, souveniers, beach items, etc. everything. If you spend $100USD or more during your stay at any of these stores, they give you a free gift. They are on every corner so it's very easy to spend $300, which is what we did. Save you receipts.

Upon booking, the 'Alohilani contacted us to confirm our reservation. Our check in with Joi was very smooth and easy. She was welcoming and followed up with us to make sure everything was meeting our expectations. Our room had the most amazing view. Imagine lying in bed and just looking out over the glorious ocean. The bed is very comfortable, the television is huge. Our bathroom was ridiculously large -- I don't recall ever having a hotel bathroom that large before. Water pressure--great. Shampoo/Conditioner/soaps -- these are from the Maile (there is a store in the resort) and are absolutely amazing. They've chosen a very neutral scent. I don't think anyone has mentioned the heated toilet seats. It's totally unexpected, and quite frankly amazing. They have a wonderful staff dedicated to teaching about the Hawaiian culture. During our time, we met with both Summer and Andria, who taught us a lot about Hawaii and Aloha. I was able to make a traditional crown lei (haku) with orchids and hibiscus. My husband and I both made orchid leis and ti leaf leis. The 'Alohilani proivdes these supplies to you during these lessons, and your lei will be more beautiful than some of the pricey leis that you can buy around Waikiki. We had also noted an activity from a previous week that was not on the schedule... the E ala E, which we were very interested in. Summer actually added it so that we could participate. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday is a torch lighting ceremony on the pool deck, and that is worth going to see. We were celebrating our anniversary, and the 'Alohilani really did that in style. We are particularly grateful to Summer for the amazing picture she got of us in the ocean. We came back from our anniversary dinner to find that picture and orchids laid out in a heart on our bed.Dining at the 'Alohilani is good, but you will find it's a touch expensive -- but let's be honest here: dining in WAIKIKI is a touch expensive, so the prices at the 'Alohilani restaurants are not out of line.We did participate in their Hawaii Legacy Tree experience on the North Short, which I do recommend highly. Hawaii will leave a lasting impact on you, why not leave a lasting gift to Hawaii in return?The 'Alohilani is directly across the street from Kuhio Beach, which is a part of Waikiki. It is within walking distance of many many things...depending on what you consider walking distance. We did walk from the Hilton Hawaiian Village to the 'Alohilani, and we also walked down to the Outrigger Canoe Club. That said, those are long walks. In the Beachside Tower is a very well provisioned and convenient ABC Store (you'll find they are a bit like Starbucks in their presence in the Waikiki area...and you'll be grateful for that!)If we went back to Oahu, we'd definitely stay here again.

Its the quieter end of town (down towards Diamond Head) which meant that the beach was also quieter than closer into the centre of town, but still lots of shops and restaurants within minutes. While not beachfront, the beach is directly across the road, so just a few minutes from your room to the beach. The hotel facilities were excellent, particularly the pool which had poolside bar and food service and beach towels available. It was also open for long hours.

I instantly regretted having booked the other hotel and wished I had booked this one for the entirety of our trip because it truly enhanced our Hawaiian experience. The rooms are spacious and have the comfort of a modern yet relaxing beach bungalow and the lobby and pool area were immaculate and impressive. The service was friendly and helpful. It was truly a beautiful experience.We had lunch at Momason which was delicious, made use of their laundry (every mother’s dream come true), enjoyed our lovely, spacious, and relaxing room and view, and liked the extra touches like the reusable water bottles and bidet. We had hoped to make better use of the beautiful pool but it rained heavily during our stay (but can see how it is an amazing and chic hangout spot). We had a toddler with us and know that he would have really enjoyed the kiddie pool and artificial grass area, weather permitting. Signage could have been improved (the pool and laundry area are a bit hidden but that also made it feel a bit more mysterious like it was a secret spot). We also would have really enjoyed room service (ie Momason in our room) rather than dealing with the cranky toddler in the restaurant during nap time. The shops could be improved as most remain vacant (a Starbucks on site would be stellar!) but having an ABC store on site was very convenient.We plan to utilize their late check out ($20/hrs) before sadly going back to our original dark and dated hotel which is sadly non-refundable. Having retreated to this hotel, albeit for only 1 night was so worthwhile, especially since we spent a lot of time indoors due to the weather. We have stayed at many hotels on the Waikiki strip (8+ and all 4 stars and up) but this is my new favorite. Great location, beautiful facilities, great service, and lovely details. This will be our go-to Waikiki resort going forward!","Campbell, California","yello815</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Campbell, California</strong>",25,5.0

I’ve been to hotels that were overbooked and I’ve been given upgrades because of it but never downgrades. I was offered an upgrade at an additional $200 a night however! That didn’t set very well, 5 minutes of me telling them this wasn’t acceptable and they suddenly found a room.When booking this hotel I read about the recent renovation, talk about putting lipstick on a pig. Cheap from the paint to the furnishing and linens. And small. In contrast we stayed at Hilton grand vacations last year and loved every minute of our time at the hotel which greatly enhanced our overall time at Waikiki. Large rooms, a quiet pool without cabana nazis (alohilani wanted $175 for half a day in one of theirs and gave us the boot even though all 4 or 5 of them were empty). I figured we probably paid a lot more for the room last year but went back to discover it was even a little bit cheaper that what we paid this year.

In fact, I’d even say it was an average 4 star hotel. The hotel-supplied pictures here and on the website are nothing short of deceptive, as too is the lovely lobby area (which is clearly designed to make people think they’re getting a certain type of experience which never actually materialises). Like other reviewers have said, the hotel lacks many basic amenities required to be considered a 5 star hotel. Where do I start? “Breakfast included” is a voucher for black coffee and a basic sandwich. The bathrooms have a 1970s-style shower curtain that you’re constantly wrestling with as you try to shower. There is no shower gel - just a manky cake of soap you have to prise off the non-existent shower ledge each day after it’s gone hard. There are no q-tips or cotton balls. There’s no clock in the room. The door to the balcony must have been missed in the renovation along with the shower, as it’s still a 70’s style sliding door that keeps jamming and jack-knifing each time you try to open it. You have to pay if you want to lie on a lounge in the shade by the pool (and I mean PAY - like over $100 per day). And given the ratio of sun lounges to hotel guests is about 1:1000 (i.e. you won’t get one unless you’re at the pool by 5am), we almost considered paying so we could at least lie by the pool. But bring your own water to the pool though, as the pool bar ran out of jugs for me to fill up when I asked for one (and no attempt was made to find one). And then when I attempted to fill up my bottle at the water fountain, I was warned like a child by one of the attendants to make sure I didn’t let the top of my bottle touch the fountain opening. Overall we felt quite angry that Alohilani had misrepresented itself so badly. And at over $500 a night, it’s just not acceptable.","Sydney, Australia","Hayley P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",18,1.0

We stayed in the Beachside building which is the old building but revamped and updated. Beds were comfortable, good balcony overlooking the beach. Only downside was it was not the greatest lighting at night and the bathroom didn't have a fan so it got muggy and extremely hot really fast. The pool area and service was beautiful. Have to get in early for good seats that don't loose sun throughout the day. Fitness area was lovely, Great equipment and fitness room. Very rare to stay somewhere that even has a quarter of the facilities at Alohilani.

We chose this hotel in previous visits because it was right across Kuhio and Waikiki beaches, and their rates were lower compared to other beachfront hotels in Waikiki. They recently renovated the hotel, and the interiors are amazing. it's a very modern, coastal look, a far cry from its former self. Just the lobby itself and driveway is airy and welcoming. The rooms have also been renovated so they do not have a kitschy old Hawaiian feel, but still warm and welcoming. Of course, your ocean view still depends on what type of room you book and where of the 2 towers you get assigned to.A really nice new improvement is their pool. We never went to the old one, but this new redesign on the 15th floor is inviting, with chaises for sunning yourself, and lots of lounge seating on a lower level to the pool, but still accessible to the pool. There is also a bar nearby for your Mai Tais and Lava Flows. The pool itself is not so big, and the chaises tend to be all occupied so it could be a little challenging to find your spot by the pool.The staff is warm and welcoming. The room rates have gone up considerably to pay for all the improvements. This is still a hotel I will recommend, since its accessibility to the beach, restaurants, and shopping is really a strong feature. If you like relaxing at the beach and pool during the day, and eating out and shopping when the sun comes down, then this hotel is one of the ones that will serve that purpose.The only food outlet in the hotel we went to was the Morimoto Waikiki restaurant, but that will be another review.","Los Angeles, California","JayMan917</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",11,5.0

There are 3 other restaurants in the premise but one is only a breakfast place and the 2 others are more Asian cuisine and not as laid back. My only complaint is the wait service at both the Swell Bar pool area and the O Bar were subpar.

But like many other reviewers, I must emphasise to anyone considering booking, this is NOT a five star resort. It is a very good four star property. My flight was delayed so I arrived well after midnight. The lobby is beautiful, but there was no one to help with bags and the woman who checked me in was not very welcoming. I asked if I could have some room service and was told that the hotel did not offer room service. I asked if I could get some bottled water delivered to the room - the answer was no. Five star? My biggest issue was the lack of information provided about the 'resort'. There is no in-room compendium or directory describing the hotel facilities, etc. I lost count of the number of people who asked me where the pool was. It was evident that I was not the only one who lacked information. After three days of staying there, there was finally a calendar of activities posted outside the elevator. For three days, I didn't realise there was sunset yoga, fish feeding, etc. The rooms are very pleasant. Not large for a 'five star resort' but it is Hawaii, so that is fairly standard. The beds were very comfortable. There was no kettle, mini bar or 'for purchase' snacks. I get that there is an ABC shop in the lobby, but a five star resort would have a few in-room options. The bathroom was small with no bathtub. Besides the very basic amenities (shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap) there was nothing else befitting a five star resort... no large bath towels, no bathrobes, no slippers, sewing kit, q-tips, etc. I found the staff very hit and miss... some of the pool staff were fantastic like Jenny and Gabby. Front desk staff were very curt. The valet/doormen didn't want to know you if you arrived or departed by Uber, but were pleasant if you were on foot or travelling by taxi. The pool area is well done... great outdoor eating area, comfy sun lounges, good and reasonably priced food. I would suggest there be a minimum age for the main pool. There is a kids pool but it goes unused and all of the little toddlers scream and cry in the main pool disturbing all of those travelling sans children. Why have a kids pool? It's nice to see an old hotel get a facelift... many more hotels in Waikiki should do the same. They've done a great job on this old hotel, but I would recommend the Alohilani as a great four star property.

Coffee is supplied in your room in the way of pods, but you only get two a day and powdered milk.

Upon report of the issue, it was rectified immediately...but probably should have been caught before we got to the room in the first place. Second, we were in room 219, which is right above the Momosan restaurant...and they play music till past 11pm. That would be fine for most people...but not with two small kids.

Well appointed, with a mini-fridge, Keurig, and pleasant smelling Malie toiletries. Room 219 was also right off the elevator, super easy. The parking garage, like many hotels, is cramped but not too hard for a Nissan Pathfinder sized car to maneuver in. Great service throughout the trip, including multiple check ins through text, which was a nice touch.Tips: -Parking garage is near the Seascape Tower. The elevators on that side of the hotel are suuuuuper slow. In the middle of the lobby there is a single elevator. If you take that elevator to the 3rd floor, you'll exit to the meeting/banquet rooms...go down the hallway and you'll be in level C of the garage. If you're parked higher than that, you can walk into the garage and there is a 2nd set of elevators that will take you to the other levels...still faster than waiting for the Seascape elevators. There are parking garage entrances on both Liliuokalani and Kuhio Streets, in case one is busy.-There is an ABC Store (I know, big surprise) attached to the hotel. If you are in the Beachside Tower, you can cut right through the store and end up at the elevators, instead of walking half the block then going back through the lobby and down a hallway.

However, I can totally see how people may give this hotel a lower rating especially if they’re not ocean front.]Why shouldn’t this be a 5-Star hotel? Let’s start with the CONS (which are mainly things I honestly don’t care about as a traveler, but you deserve to know): No greeting with a welcome drink, but instead two mai tai vouchers for the bar (where you explain that you’re expecting and ask if your husband can have your shot instead while you drink just the juice and you’re told TWICE that next time, you’ll get charged for such a request after your original nice server said it was absolutely fine!!) while Embassy Suites is a 3.5-star hotel with welcome drinks and a free alcohol-included daily Manager’s Reception. Just sayin’... I was told that they’d make my stay special since it’s our babymoon and we arrive to a plain room (no note, no sparkling cider for me or wine that my husband can drink, no flowers, no dessert, no nothing aka no 5-star touch). Speaking of drinks, they give two refillable pouches for water in each room with the refilling station located all the way down on the first floor instead of daily bottles of water and if you need ice, the ice machine is only located on odd numbered floors—not the even floors. Odd indeed... We were in Room 8-23 in the Beachside Tower and its bathroom was different from the website in that the vanity was crammed in the bathroom with the shower and toilet, so you can’t close the bathroom door without the bathmat towel catching the door and if you don’t close the toilet seat, be prepared to drop things in it while you get ready in the morning. There is no way two people can get ready in this bathroom at the same time. Also, there’s only one sink because the right side of the vanity is blocked by the toilet. (There’s no mini bar or microwave if you care about that kind of thing and just your basic toiletries—face soap, body soap, shampoo and conditioner, and lotion. No fun shaving kits or shoe polish or Q-tips or cotton balls or nail files. The face tissue isn’t soft and the towels aren’t fluffy. Although the body scrub pad and fluffiest hotel slippers ever are nice! Oh, and let’s not forget the bidet which my husband loved.)It should also be noted that this is not really a “resort” in my book because it isn’t very expansive with many amenities. It’s a smaller, pretty, newly renovated, very clean hotel with a couple of useless shops with the exception of the ABC Store, and a very unique and lovely aquarium wall bar. They have an activity calendar with yoga, aquarium feedings, live hawaiian music in the bar, etc. The infinity pool is modern and pretty with cabanas, but it doesn’t face the ocean or anything. It’s located on the 4th floor with no signs on the Beachside tower side to tell you how to get to it. (Other than needing towels for the beach though, there’s no need to spend time at a pool when the ocean is steps away...) Finally, a potential major problem to some may be that the hotel isn’t located at the water’s edge. Instead, the beach is on one side of Kalakaua Avenue and Alohilani is on the other, so when you’re on your lanai, you can definitely hear tour buses, motorcycles, leaf blowers, etc. mixed in with the actual desired sounds of the waves crashing. Also, the sea wall didn’t bother me in the least from the lanai, but it may be an eyesore to the extremely picky traveler. I didn’t hang out at the beach in front of Alohilani, but I imagine that the sea wall may be nice for those who want to play in more shallow waters or annoying to those who want the waves to hit the shore naturally without the wall stifling them. Because I’ve only stayed at some 5-star hotels and only primarily care about cleanliness (and the view if I’m paying for it), I don’t mind the above other than the fact that I’ve stayed at lower star hotels without a lot of these issues, so I’m unsure what qualifies Alohilani as a 5-Star, quite frankly. With that said, on to the PROS (assuming you stay ocean front!): very clean and fresh feeling (due to the new renovation) and THE VIEW!! My goodness!! Their ocean front rooms are true ocean front with nothing blocking your view. I’m not sure if it’s the time of year or my eyes playing tricks on me, but I swear Alohilani’s location makes it so that you have the perfect view of all of the colors of the ocean. When I stand on the lanai and look to my right at hotels that are actually on the water (like The Royal Hawaiian), their water appears a sea foam green color—still pretty, until you look straight from your lanai or to your left and see gorgeous turquoises, blues, greens, and hints of purple. Another blessing is being able to see the unblocked sunset to your right from your lanai. No need to clamber for a spot on the beach. You can watch it privately from your own room! When the sun rises, you get a view of the sky painted pink as well. If you get hot while on the lanai, you can still clearly see the ocean from the comfort of your bed. In fact, the second you swing your door open after checking in, you can see the water immediately. What a greeting!For around $100 less than other 5-star hotels (probably because they are truly 5-star...), I’d feel extremely lucky to be able to return one day. Clean room and a breathtaking view?? What more could you ask for?(Again, I never photoshop or put filters on my pictures. The view is just that gorgeous.)","Fountain Valley, California","HappyB414</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fountain Valley, California</strong>",56,5.0

It also has an in-house laundromat that you can use for a small fee and the location is perfection. The negatives - the bathroom is tiny ! So tiny that when you open the door it almost touched the toilet. For a five star hotel you expect slippers, robes, shower caps, q tips, wine glasses, room service etc - you get none of these - it’s as if they are trying to save every dollar they can. The air con in the rooms are extremely loud and so are their lifts ! You hear every single sound from your room and the balcony doors are not sound proof. In the morning you will wake up to the sound of the cleaners yelling at each other from either ends of the hotel hallway.They have a shallow infinity pool that is overrun by children and so is their spa. Getting drink service is not easy whilst laying by the pool. When we checked in no one told us where the pool was located or how to get there (there are two buildings in this hotel) overall customer service was really not that great - we kept having to ask for things that should’ve been explained at check in. The pool area was booked out twice for a private event so expect to be kicked out. Was it worth the money we paid ? Absolutely not. Would we stay there again?

We immediately got into our bathing suits and headed to the pool called swell. Walking out to swell it felt like something off a tv show. We sat at the outside bar- had a really cool bartender named Brandon. We ordered Tuna dip- a fruity drink for me and a beer for hubby. The Tuna was so good and hit the spot. The pool is absolutely stunning! You can see the ocean from the pool. It was Just what we needed after being at the hotel down the street. This was more of an adult pool and hotel in my opinion. Not as many kids as the hotel down the street. The bed and linens were comfortable ~ they have laundry facilities on site where you can wash your clothes- nice shower and ice cold AC. Staff was exceptional and this was my favorite hotel out of the three we stayed at in Honolulu!,"Benton, Louisiana","Smiley100_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Benton, Louisiana</strong>",14,5.0

Obviously, had I known that there would be a category 4 hurricane approaching Honolulu, I would've cancelled sooner, yet BOTH my flight (Alaska Air) and rental car (National) were a breeze (no pun intended) to cancel with no charge, despite both of their policies that don't allow for last min cancellations. They both obviously were fine making an exception for a ****ING NATURAL DISASTER!!!To be clear, I made this reservation from a 3rd party, which I RARELY do because of situations like this, but hotels.com is NOT responsible for this nonsense. Hotels.com customer service called the hotel themselves (while putting me on hold) and confirmed to me that it is only the Alohilani reservations department that can authorize a full refund this close to check-in. They also told me that if I called the hotel that they'd just refer me back to Hotels.com. This is an absolutely ridiculous way to squeeze $300 out of someone who was forced to cancel a trip to Hawaii because of the approaching Hurricane Lane. What a sham. I can only assume that if they're doing things like this that they likely also squeeze money from their guests in other shady ways. Read the fine print, because these guys have no shame.

Firstly it’s so clean and this is a major plus point for me, with so many tourists around Waikiki - sometimes trash is inevitable, but the team at Waikiki make sure their hotel is spotless 24/7, without feeling like there are staff hovering around you - the rooms are always made up and ours included robes, chocolates, a majorly nice welcome at check in, a superb close car park attached and then everything we needed in the hotel whilst filming. We had a beautiful gym, new and stylish outdoor setting - infinity pools overlooking the beach - cabanas, amazing food and one of the best açaí bowls I had on the island (which was surprising to have in a hotel and not a hole in the wall type place) we loved our stay and the fact it’s 39 floors high allows you to watch the sunsets and sea the clear skies and deep blue seas from most of the rooms.

We could decide what we wanted to do for the day on the day and they made it happen at a cheaper price. They were amazing. This type of service and comfort is perfect for any luxury holiday.

After a day of activities you want to relax by the pool with a cocktail in your hand. Well this would be perfect if kids weren’t bomb diving around you and running around the pool. Yes there are pool rules but definitely not enforced or monitored.

We did not pack a car seat for our 2 year old toddler because there would be one at our destination on the mainland. So I inquired with the valet dept about any taxis or ubers that offer car seats. I interacted with Chadwick. He informed me that there weren't any taxis that offered seats. He then told me he had a booster seat for his own child that he could let me use. However, my toddler isn't big enough for a booster. He then explained that he also had a toddler car seat which was hard to remove, but would do so so that we could use it for the drive to the airport. He explained that he could call a cab driver he knew to be there a little early & would return the car seat to Chadwick. Chadwick not only had the taxi there on time, but installed the car seat for us. As you know the drive to the airport is not short so having this car seat to keep our child safe was beyond important to us.

Loved it! The entrance to this hotel is very nice and spacious to accommodate the many cars and vans dropping off hotel guests. You walk in through large wooden doors that remain open giving open air feel to the hotel entrance. The registration desk personnel were extremely nice and accommodating. They have even incorporated text messaging to personalize your stay and ability to reach them for whatever you need. A large aquarium is also on full display in the main lobby at the O Bar. The aquarium was beautiful. Room: This hotel has two towers. We stayed in the larger tower in the standard Diamond Head Ocean view room. It was comfortable and kept pretty clean. My only issue with the room was the bathroom--a little tight for space. The toilet also seemed lower to the ground which could be difficult for taller people and those with bad knees. Restaurants: We fell in love with the staff and food at the O Bar. They offered both breakfast/lunch/dinner and made one of the best burgers. Many occasions we ordered food to go and brought it up to the pool bar area (since that bar had a different menu). If you want a quick cup of coffee and pastry, this is the spot to go to. The Lychee bar offered buffet breakfast, but it was ~$40/person. Yikes that's a lot for breakfast. We also ate at Chef Morimoto's restaurant. It was delicious, but it was also very expensive for the portions you get. I would suggest this restaurant for very small groups or couples who want the ambiance and experience. If you are very hungry, you might want to go some place else. Lastly, we ate at the Swell Bar (by the pool). They also had some good food, but as I mentioned earlier, the O Bar was more our speed. We did not eat at any of the other restaurants. Pool: The pool and pool area was very nice. There was an infinity pool, hot tub, and kiddie pool. The main pool was always crowded as well as the hot tub. The pool seating area and the hangout area was very nicely furnished and decorated. This was definitely a great spot to hangout out during any time of the day. Staff: All the staff were very pleasant and welcoming. We fell in love with the O Bar staff who took care of our every need. We definitely made some new friends there and hope to see them again soon! I highly recommend this hotel for all types of guests. The location is perfect--directly across the street from the beach and down a few blocks from the main part of the Waikiki drag. Waikiki is very crowded and very expensive. If you have a large family, be sure to plan to pay at least $12 or more per person wherever you go to dine. We did not visit McDonald's or Burger King so I don't know what their prices are like. I will definitely go back to this location on our next visit.","Redwood City, CA","awdang_99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redwood City, CA</strong>",27,5.0

The way that they advertise their rooms is misleading. Not all bathrooms have glass showers and/or bidet (Japanese style) toilets. Ocean view rooms are on the sides of the building so your view will be obstructed or partial at best. If you want a true ocean view room you have to book an ocean front. We were here for less than 24 hours and heard three other customers complain about the same issues we had. I’ve attached pictures of our bathroom but looked at other rooms (two bedroom queens) & one bathroom was smaller without access to the sink/mirror area. I’m a bathroom snob so I was disappointed. We loved Hyatt Centric last time we were here & will be booking with them from now on. Alohilani staff upgraded us to a Diamond Head view which was beautiful, 31st floor.

Location is unbelievable, beachfront on the best part of Waikiki beach, you are literally only a few steps and your toes are in the sand.... unbelievable!The pool is breathtaking, infinity pool overlooking the ocean and with a spa section. There are cabanas that you can hire, we didn't but because we were always heading down to the beach for most of the day however next time I will give one a go.The pool area is awesome at night, they have great setting area with firepits and a great bar to sip cocktails.Food was excellent throughout and reasonable priced. We ate at both iron chef restaurants, I definitely preferred Masaman which he ended up eating at once, this was also alot cheaper than Morimoto. I personally wouldn't go back to Morimoto because it wasn't my taste but Masaman was my favourite food in all Waikiki.Rooms were nice and bright, they could do with a few new soft furnishings though. We had a ocean view room which was well worth the money. Next time I would upgrade to the oceanfront room, the views must be unbelievable from these rooms.Service throughout was excellent. You can still tell it's a new property because not all of the shops at the bottom of the hotel are open, however didn't mind me because there's plenty of shopping elsewhere. There's a little delicatessen/market at the bottom of the hotel which was really handy, we bought lunches to take to the beach and wine for the room.Excellent hotel, will be back!","Melbourne, Australia","Travel_of_betts</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",12,5.0

If you have ever stayed in a 5 star then you will be disappointed. 2: They advertise ocean views. Please understand that you will not be getting an ocean view. You will have to bend over your balcony to and look through buildings to see a part of them ocean. When I complained they let me look at 2 other rooms with ""ocean views"" but they were no better. 3: To be a 5 star hotel you have to call them and request anything. There were no bellman after my 6pm arrival to help with luggage and take it to the room. This is done today and most 4 star hotels. 4: This is a pretty and clean hotel that looks very modern. I liked the bar area with the very large aquarium. The drinks had very little liquor in them and food at this bar wasn't that great. 5: The rooms were pretty typical of most hotels. Nothing special and definitely nothing extra. I could hear people laughing in the next room and people walking up and down the hallways. I stayed in room 1960. My experience wasn't terrible but it definitely wasn't worth the almost $600 for 1 night stay. This hotel should be a 4 star and sell for $200/night.

We regularly visit Hawaii so were excited to try out this newly renovated luxury hotel which sadly didn’t live up to expectations and is far from the 5 star hotel it claims to be. The good• The hotel is styled nicely. If you want photos for your Instagram to make your friends jealous, then you will get them here. However you’re in Hawaii so everything is Instagam worthy, you don’t have to stay here.• The bed is comfortable• There is lots of storage space to unpack all your clothes• The reusable drink bottles are a nice idea, but they leak so make sure they stay upright• The TV is quite large and swivels so you can watch it from the little couch• The location is good, but so is the location of 60% of the hotels in Waikiki. Waikiki isn’t that big, you can pretty much walk anywhere.The bad• The bathroom is tiny. The vanity area is a decent size but the shower and toilet combo are so tiny you have to stand over the toilet to dry yourself. There also is only one hook to hang one towel, the other has to be hung on a railing over the toilet but it’s set so low that when drying (eg not folded in half) the towel hangs over the front of the toilet• The walls are paper thin, you can hear your neighbors• The doors are super heavy and no one holds them as they close so you constantly hear doors banging from as early as 5.30am as people get up for day trips• The noise from the live music at Swell bar at night is so loud you can’t hear anything but it. They also closed off the pool from 2pm until 10pm one day we were there for a private function and the music playing was so loud until 9.30pm it sounded like we were in the middle of a rave. When we complained about it we were just told it was for a fundraiser and they would be done by 9pm but they didn’t stop until 9.30pm.• The building is a smoke free building however there are no signs anywhere about this so EVERYONE smokes on their balcony. We spent most of our 2 weeks calling the front desk to ask them to tell people to stop smoking however nothing ever really happened and it got to the point that we couldn’t have our balcony door open.• The pool area is open to the general public so is over crowded. It’s also full of little kids and not the relaxing pool you see in all the photos, more like a pool on a cruise ship. There is a designated kids pool however when we checked this out there was no kids in there, they were all in the infinity pool.• There is really nothing in the room you would expect in a 5 star hotel and if you want something you have to ask for it. For example, there’s and ice bucket but no wine or champagne glasses. There is no showercap, no robes etc.• There is minimal security, you don’t need to swipe to go to your level in the elevator so anyone can go anywhere in the hotel.The uglyThe service at this hotel is atrocious. We’ve stayed at other 5 star hotels in Hawaii and the Alohilani doesn’t even rate 1 star compared to their service. When walking through the hotel, staff will not smile or hold doors/elevators for you if they’re in front of you. If you ask someone for help you don’t get it and no one proactively goes out of their way to make sure you have a great experience.Some examples:On check in, we were not welcomed, not asked if we had stayed there before, not told where anything was, not given any information about the hotel. It was very transactional, how can I get through these people and onto the next. This is fine, however not for the price of the hotel and for a 5 star hotel.We went to the guests services desk and asked them where were nice places to take photos around the hotel as it was our 10 year anniversary and we’d hired a photographer to mark the occasion. The response we got was “I don’t know, this is only my third day. Maybe ask someone else”. Again, if this was a true 5 star hotel we would have gotten a “congratulations, what sort of photos are you looking to take, casual, formal etc and I’ll find out some great places and get back to you”. As far as we could tell guest services just handed out maps of Waikiki. We walked past the front desk and valet every day at least twice for 2 weeks and not once did any of them smile or acknowledge us. Our biggest issue with the Alohilani was with the Swell bar and it’s management. In January, 6 months before our stay, we contacted the Alohilani and told them we were looking to host a private formal dinner for 5 people and asked if they had a suitable venue. We were connected to the manager of the Swell Bar at the time (Ryan) who we went back and forth with over a 1 month period locking in what was promised to be a formal 6 course degustation with matching wines for $178pp. Four weeks before our event (and since we hadn’t heard from anyone at the hotel to confirm our event), I contacted the manager to find that he no longer worked there. After a week of chasing different people trying to get someone to contact me, the new manager (also called Ryan) sent me the bar menu and said to pick something from the assortment of pizza and sandwiches if we wanted to do an event. I sent through the menu and quote I had been sent by the previous Ryan to be told “we don’t have a chef so we can’t do that”. Disheartened as this was to be the highlight of our trip, I asked for Ryan to confirm what they could do for us otherwise we would need to book another venue. After a week of chasing Ryan to call me back, he finally emailed and said they could still do the event and that my husband and I could meet with the new chef when we arrived at the hotel, the week prior to our event.When we met with the chef and Ryan, we were told that there was no way the menu that was promised to us could happen and that the chef we were meeting now wasn’t even going to be there the day of our event, and that “the guys who will make the dinner aren’t that skilled so can’t do anything too complicated”. We were assured that they would send us a revised proposed menu that day which wouldn’t be as complicated as the first one however would still make our event special for our guests. We chased the new menu for 2 days and received it only 2 days before the scheduled event and were so disappointed with the new menu which was basically sliced watermelon, sliced tomato, a salad and then sliced pineapple. We emailed Ryan to advise him that we were disappointed and would not be going ahead with the event however all we got back from Ryan was a “ok”. No sorry, no bottle of wine sent to our room to apologise for leaving us with 2 days to re-plan an event our guests had flown 10 hours to attend and had already received invitations for – nothing.If you want to spend lots of money but not get the experience you’re paying for, stay here. If you want to get a 5 star treatment stay anywhere but here. If you want cool Instagram photos, just go to the Swell bar without being a guest, everyone else does.","Sydney, Australia","SydneyKate08</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",38,3.0

The newly renovated front driveway is really nice and welcoming. Even more welcoming than that is the front desk concierge staff. Specifically, Akemi. She, along with everyone us was more than accommodating to our room requests and simple check in process. BUT..........a couple days after we checked in (we had a 2 week stay), we decided to do something nice for the housekeeping staff and leave a tip to establish rapport and to just be nice people. And so, after leaving that tip, we left that morning and came back with fresh towels, made beds, and such. HOWEVER, we also noticed probably the WORST POSSIBLE SIN ANY HOSPITALITY OPERATION COULD DO EVERRRRR. ITEMS WERE MISSING FROM OUR ROOM. YES, I COULDNT BELIEVE IT EITHER. The most expensive item that was taken was a $300 dollar tub of cosmetic cream that was actually a birthday gift and was left in the bathroom as soon as we checked into the hotel. At first, before we decided to tell the manager and front desk staff, we flipped the room over just to make sure that before we reported it, we weren't being idiots. But low and behold, it was nowhere to be seen. So we reported it to the front desk and even went downstairs to talk to the manager, PAUL. But for whatever reason, I guess when things like that happen, it must be protocol for them to not care whatsoever. They treated the situation as if it was no big deal and gave us the feeling that they genuinely did not care, especially, the MANAGER AT THE TIME, PAUL. He really seemed like the situation was nothing. We explained to him that we really did not care honestly how expensive the stolen item was. It was the fact that it got stolen and made us feel so violated and invaded. And who knows, housekeeping, or whoever else has access to the rooms could be stealing items from other tourists staying in the hotel. I mean, were on vacation and decided to stay 2 weeks in your hotel PAUL. But of course, they did absolutely nothing to remedy the situation. Even just an apology would have made us feel better, but not even that courtesy was there. Just ridiculous.If you want your things stolen out of your hotel room and feel like you're not a priority whatsoever as guest in the hotel, welcome to Alohilani Resort. Otherwise, you'll be much happier to stay at any of the other 50 hotels on Waikiki Beach. I hear their staff doesn't steal from guests.Also, shoutout to PAUL, the manager we spoke to.

The bathroom - just like the entire room - was very clean (and obviously rather recently renovated).The toilet has a bidet and a heated seat ... which is nice, i guess?There‘s a Keurig with to-go cups and a fridge. The AC keeps the room cool without generating too much noise.Hotel WiFi is super fast and there‘s coverage even at the pool area. each nightstand has 2 USB ports for charging your electronic devices.The hotel is perfectly located for you to explore Waikiki beach. It‘s on the south end of Waikiki beach and therefore closer to Queen‘s beach, which is a lot less busy and which is also where most surf lessons happen. Another thing worth mentioning is the relatively large area in front of the hotel where you can unload your car without blocking anyone‘s way. great if you arrive with a rental!Be aware that there‘s a $35 / night hotel fee atop your room charge.We weren‘t expecting to use the (fantastic!) saltwater infinity pool on the 5th floor rooftop as much as we ended up doing. There‘s more than enough sunbeds, so you‘ll likely find a pair for you and your partner. We GREATLY appreciated the fact that front desk staff told us were able to use the pool after the 11am check-out which made the wait for our evening flight even more bearable.You get free towels, and there‘s a bar - cocktails are like 13$, soft drinks 4$.I can‘t really make a call with regards to whether or not this hotel is a great „value“ for what it offers.

Where does one even get mini pillows?).The room has no mini-bar or in room menu; no alarm clock; no bottle opener; none of the items you would expect for a five star accomodation.

Every day, housekeeping arranged our son's stuffed animals and blankets on his bed, a very special touch! Pool amenities were good. Poor service by servers, greater than 15 minutes to bring a single drink. The pool rules seemed to change every day, one day, we needed to give a card to order order a drink, the next day, no card needed, we could open a tab and close out with the card at the end. Very confusing to have different rules. However, the pool manager was very informative and offered a refreshing face mist while relaxing in the afternoon sun. The concierge Abbie was OK nothing special about her service. We were very disappointed and frustrated to walk and walk and walk with poor directions to the enterprise car rental. If Abbie would have noted, the car rental is located in the Island Colony building, we would have been able to find the location without any problem, but all we received was walking directions on a paper map.

Everything I read and all the pictures I viewed created an expectation of what my experience at this hotel would be. 1st of all, let's start with the good things. It is a beautiful hotel. The entry way when you drive up is beautiful in design and the choice of woods for the doors, decking and flooring. 2nd while standing in line a woman comes by offering you ice water and a flower for your hair. (don't be fooled, after her there will be no service) The beds and pillows are comfortable, the soaps and shampoos etc. were excellent. I loved the salt water infinity pool that gives you a view of the Waikiki beach and the Pacific Ocean. The staff at the pool area were always smiling and helpful. Our waitress at the pool area was attentive and made sure our needs were met. The hotel is a great location, steps from the beach! What I have written so far is why it get's three stars. I can not deny those positive things. But, that is where it ends. When something is consistently rated 4 stars and it bills itself as a high end resort with high prices, I expect service not just looks. This is apparently a new company that has taken over this hotel and perhaps the kinks are not worked out. But to the management here are some serious flaws that would need to be corrected before I pay that kind of money per night: there was no bellman to take our luggage to our room upon arrival, I had to stand in line with my luggage and carry my own luggage up; the check in person did not inform us that there was no room service nor did she provide a map or listing of where all of the services were located or even that there were events the hotel was putting on. Her main concern was in asking if I preferred to pay the resort fees ahead of time or at check out. I told her check out and she charged them at that time anyway. After arriving to our room, we needed an additional luggage rack in our room. We called to request and no one answered. We called several times and no one answered. Finally we called the outside line and reach a manager who apologized and then we received the extra luggage rack. We discovered no room service nor any materials that told us anything about the hotel. We went down to the O Bar to get take out. Again it was packed up in nice packaging but we arrived to our room to find an over cooked burger with no condiments! We were exhausted from travel and found an over cooked dry burger with no condiments, then a flat bread pizza that was soggy and inedible, a horrible tasting tomato on it, and a Kale salad for $16 that was a pile of large leaves with ceasar dressing on them, that was it for $16. This was our 1st evening and did not set us on a positive note. Like I said there were no materials or person to explain how everything works. So, I asked the front desk where I could get towels to take to the beach, she politely sent me to the bell desk. The person at the bell desk offered towels but in a condescending tone told me I was to get the towels in the pool area from now on as though I was trying to get away with something. But exactly where is the pool? There was nothing anywhere to indicate where. I later discovered there were 2 towers of rooms on either side of the hotel. The tower across from where I was staying did have signs for the pool area and restaurants etc. But not anywhere on our tower. The next day we looked for the pool by going to the 5th floor but in the wrong tower and finally discovered if we went through an exit door we would find the pool. No signs. Our party consisted of 2 adults and 1 teenager, which is what our reservation was for; in our room there was only enough stuff for 2 people. We asked the cleaning people for more towels, coffee etc. and they begrudgingly left more. 2 people in our party took turns being sick and on one day did not allow our room to be cleaned. This was a mistake, because if you didn't let them clean and resupply on their schedule, forget it! I found the cleaning staff to be snippy, stingey and suspicious. Once we walked in while they were cleaning and she asked us if this was our room? What? I've never had that happen to me before. If you miss the cleaning people, you won't get what you need because either no one answers the phone or they never show up. The one time I succeeded in reaching a person and requested coffee pods they never showed up. We were there for 9 nights. With no room service, a small refrigerator and only a microwave if you paid extra. I refused to pay extra at this point. We were sorry we did not rent a condo! What was the point in paying for a nice hotel, with no room service period! Can't even get complimentary coffee or towels! Upon check out I was asked if I needed a bellman for my luggage or would like to dine at the O Bar while I waited for my shuttle. I told her no, I had taken care of all of that. Why would I call and call for no one to show up? I'd miss my shuttle to the airport. There was no way I was spending another dime at the O Bar for horrible food. Now while, I'd love to find an excuse to stay in Hawaii, I wanted out of an expensive Hotel that sells itself like a 4 star resort to only feel like I was in an upgraded Motel 6. Meaning self service, the only difference was the price, nice towels and a nice bed. So, if you don't mind spending a lot of money to have a nice bed, towels, and a nice pool this is the place for you. If you want full scale service, there are plenty of wonderful full service hotels and resorts in the area. If you do decide to stay here despite this review, expect to serve your self, don't eat at the O Bar, the pool is on the 5th floor, apparently there is tennis or ball cages on the 17th floor, never found them, and stop at the elevator because there are a list of activities listed that are occuring at the hotel, but check the dates because it might be last weeks. Needless to say I am not happy, perhaps if I'd have paid 1/2 the amount I paid to stay here I would have been satisfied. It's a beautiful place, but the engine is broken. Upon my return to Waikiki I will be finding other accommodations. In my opinion, unhappy staff, staff that are snippy and stingey, this is a direct result of extremely poor management. This place has potential but it is far from a 4 star resort. Read the bad reviews 1st! If I had done that I would have chose other accommodations as the other bad reviews I read after I arrived confirmed my complaints. The best part of the hotel was the ABC store on the bottom floor, great food, great service, smiling and friendly staff! If only they offered delivery to our room, the ABC staff that is.","Seaside, California","RMarshall2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seaside, California</strong>",53,3.0

Beautiful lobby2. Great location3. Comfy bed4. Epic hotel gymAnd now on to the negatives:1. Rooms are not sound proof. You can see light coming through door and as this is the old Pacific Beach Hotel some rooms still have an adjoining door (which has not been renovated). Be prepared to hear every cough, sniffle and conversation in the hallway and if you are lucky enough to have that adjoining door, from your neighbours. 2. Tiny, tiny bathroom with a strange shower design. No door but just a small shower where half is open to the bathroom. The bathroom gets soaked. 3. Noise outside! We were on the 35th floor and as the sliding doors have not been changed since what looks like the ‘60s, there is no triple pane glass to block out the sound and the street sounds below can be heard at all hours making it very noisy 4. Building Details - while the hotel has had a facelift the facade is so clearly 1970s from the old rusted balcony railways, low popcorn ceilings, minuscule washrooms, lack of sound proofing and old yellowed out hardware. Pictures make it look like a 5 but without the beer goggles she’s a 3 at best. 5. Staff - truly not that friendly and housekeeping was spotty.6. No room service - how can you be a five star hotel with no room service? 7. No alarm clock in the room - how strange is this?8. Weak wifi and for a $35 USD resort fee a night, I expect betterThis is a 3 star hotel at best. The old bones show through, service is tepid and the attention to detail just isn’t there. While they have put some high priced lipstick on a pig, it’s still a pig. Given the high price and huge disappointment, I will pick a real 5 star for my next stay in Honolulu.

It was a moderately priced hotel with a lot of history with the locals. I've been to wedding, birthday parties, and, a long time ago, I was even employed here. I semi-reluctantly stayed here on a friend's recommendation...and I'm soo glad I did. I had heard of the extensive renovations, but when I valeted my car and walked into the lobby, I was blown away. This hotel was completely redone, updated, upgraded and it looks like a completely different property. Of course, the location remains perfect. It's far enough that I felt like I was on vacation from the crowds and loud noises, but near enough that everything in Waikiki was within a short walk. I was on a staycation and ventured out everyday to take in the sights and see what was new in Waikiki, but I always looked forward to getting back to the hotel. The bars on the pool deck and in the previous site of the local favorite restaurant, The Oceanarium, was inviting with comfortable chairs, sofas and tables. There was some great live music...really, really good! So much so that we will return with our friends for some drinks and pupus (appetizers). Every morning, we got our workouts in at the hotel gym...which is an actual gym! Great idea to have an actual club gym on property. Never stayed at a hotel with a club gym on property, but it's an awesome idea for people who like to workout before binging on the local cuisine. Whenever I book rooms, I look for hotels with gyms on property. I've been disappointed by dinky workout rooms with the dingy light and a few rusty, old, squeaky machines, but the gym at Alohilani is NOT that kind of gym.Drinks were stiff and not terribly priced for Waikiki...and there's a Morimoto restaurant on property!

We booked two twin bed rooms. The rooms were very clean and spacious. There were lots of storage. The beds are queen beds, big enough for two adults and two children. The shower was fairly clean. But the toilet bowl was too low, at least 6 inches lower than those conventional ones. The water in the toilet bowl would almost touch my bum. I got to lift my bum in order to wipe otherwise my hand would touch my poo in the water while wiping my bum. The room ceiling was fairly low, slightly above 8 feet only. The infinity pool was very small, only good for playing, not for swimming. The deck was large and nice. We did not book for breakfast which would cost $35 per person. We enjoyed our breakfast in Macdonalds just outside the hotel. This hotel is just 3 minutes’ walk to the Waikiki Beach and 10 minutes to busy Waikiki Beach Walk. So it had a good location in Waikiki. There were lots of ABC stores nearby which were like Japan Family Mart or 7-11 though they almost sold everything including spirits and clothes. I will give it a 8.1 rating.

The hotel is a renovated property and its earlier incarnation was clearly a lower-level hotel as the bathrooms are VERY small and the sink area is open to the room. There are not enough towel racks for wet bathing suits or wet towels. There is no upscale feel to the bathroom whatsoever. All but suites also lack robes or body wash unless you request them. There is no room service and towels for the beach have to be picked up at the pool, which necessitates an extra stop. The spa also really isn't a spa, just a pair of services offered through the gym. However, the gym is very good for a hotel. They advertise a tennis court, but it's not really protected from the wind and it would be easy to hit balls over the side of the building--you are better off playing on the local courts.On the positive, the staff is very responsive to issues they can address. You can actually text the manager-on-duty, and they are responsive--we had to have a mattress replaced because it was broken (springs damaged)!. The elevators also work very well despite only having 4 for 39 floors (plus a secret two from the second floor up).

We loved it so much that we feel it's on par with the resort we chose for our honeymoon in Bora Bora. In fact, if you're considering the Alohilani Resort for your honeymoon, it's perfect! We stayed on the 16th floor in an oceanfront room. The view was spectacular!! We had a panoramic view of Waikiki Beach. The beach was gorgeous and pleasant to swim in because it was like an ocean pool. There is a short lava rock wall that surrounds Kuhio Beach and keeps out waves and coral rocks. So you have a lovely, soft sandy beach. The close-up view of Diamond Head from the water is awesome. It is a family-friendly beach and resort. Our room was comfortable with a king-size bed, central air conditioning, mini refrigerator and spa-like bathroom. Amanda sent us a personalized card and note along with a bottle of champagne and tropical fruit platter for our anniversary. Very sweet!! Every staff member at the resort is professional, friendly, and helpful. We enjoyed our time with the resort staff, as they are personable and caring. The pool and lounge area is fantastic!! The pool and hot tub are salt water not chlorine. The cabanas are gorgeous and well worth the prices. We intend to reserve one on our next visit. The bar serves ono food (hello,mahi tacos!) and the best mai tais and smoothies. The pool is wonderful during the day and at night. I enjoyed the convenience of being able to walk into the ABC Store from inside the hotel. It is a nice, clean store with a friendly staff. The breezeway can be busy at times and the valet staff handle it with ease. Check out was pleasant because a staff member approaches everyone in line to expedite their business and offer cold water.

There is a beautiful bar area with aquarium tank where we had our cocktails. They also had a wonderful musician the evening we were there. The pool area, although small, was beautiful - with infinity pool, poolside bar, and lovely cabanas you can rent. One of the best parts of our stay was breakfast at The Lychee. It was pricey for breakfast at $35 per person. However, I have to say it was one of the best buffet breakfasts I’ve ever had. There was so much variety. I loved the Eggs Benedict and papaya. My husband loved their Portuguese sausage, grilled Saba, and Natto. Although not cheap for breakfast, it was reasonable for the food quality. The only exception to that was the pancakes. I hope they change their pancake batter recipe. Everything else was superb. And Guillermo was very attentive. What would have made it 5 Stars? Maybe more towel racks and shelf space.

If felt very glamorous and fabulous, and the staff were friendly and genuine. The décor is welcoming and peaceful and loved seeing the large aquarium wall on arrival. We were determined to experience every part of the hotel in our 4 days there –highlights include:Super comfortable beds (ok, bathrooms small, everyone notes that…all fine).Fabulous outdoor area with soft seating, pool loungers and great bar. It was so fun to have lovely staff come around and offer to clean our sunglasses, spray our faces etc. Bar staff great, with particular call out to Jarrison who looked after us. It was great chatting to other guests at the bar. Pools great fun with Infinity pool having views over beach and water bean bags to relax on. (Yes pool cold when you first get in). We had our 8 year old son with us who wanted to explore: the hotel gym is incredible with all new facilities and loads of steppers/treadmills etc. Then we went and played tennis on the clay courts, used an outdoor exercise training system, and others were using the batting nets. Morimoto Asia – went here for our 10th wedding anniversary. Great being both professional and relaxed. Food superb (must get the ribs and whole crispy fish), highly recommend this, and would advise to book. (Strange note that the bucket chairs are a bit low for the tables, even people next to us asked for cushions)! We also tried the more casual Momosan and this we enjoyed for lunch where we shared appetisers. We also did the buffet breakfast once, and this was the one place in the hotel where I was a bit underwhelmed - $39 and there was reasonable selection but seemed very pricey (kids half price) and nothing was a stand out. O Bar was nice by aquarium for a drink and listening to musicians/singers each night – good holiday vibe. Great location opposite sheltered beach and would definitely return to Alohilani.","Wellington, New Zealand","irishnz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",58,5.0

However, it is beyond their power to address the problems that prevent this property living up to a supposed 5-Star rating. (this turns out to be an Expedia rating, and not an internationally-recognised hotel rating system) Problems include:Ridiculously small bathrooms.No room service.Only one of the 'Shops at Alohilani' being open for business.The only two restaurants in the hotel are Asian-themed.The Swell Pool and Bar was closed for private functions twice during my four-night stay. There should be dedicated function/event facilities that do not inconvenience guest use of facilities, especially when resort fees are added to room rates. The pool area has insufficient sunbeds for such a large hotel. This matter is not helped by non-guests being able to walk in and use the pool. The only time residency is checked is if you borrow towels. I would say that this hotel is aiming to focus on the Japanese market. In which case, it is going to have to up its game to meet their discerning needs. Staff worthy of credit for their attentive service - Renee at reception and Micah at the breakfast buffet.

This is just very welcoming to me. Having two little kids make this part a convenience. The check in was a breeze, everyone is smiling, very welcoming and it just makes us feel at home. A lot of good things to say about this resort, let me state my faves.. the bed is really comfy, the room is super clean and insulated properly that we can sleep well without any outside noise at any time, a medium size safe is available for your valuables (I kept my 3 red ring camera lenses in it if I don't use them), ABC store is within the building – awesome! Laundry is available and efficient at the 5th floor (you guys don’t need to pack up your closet for a week of clothes because of this), cavana oh-nana!! is exquisite and the infinity pool is the best, another pool - for kids is located adjacent to the hot tub with its own cavana (my kids LOVED it so bad). My kids went to see Moana on their movie night and enjoyed the popcorn next to this kids pool.. but wait, the ease and breeze of the walking distance Waikiki beach is better!!

They did an awesome job on the redo. When you walk into the lobby it looks very high end. We got a king bedded partial ocean. The view was nice and even had a shot of Diamondhead! Super comfy bed, nice lanai, fridge, safe, and lots of USB outlets. No clock radio and the huge flatscreen had a delay in loading the channels. Bathroom was way nice with Maile amenities. The toilet seat was heated and had lots of controls to run the bidet. For those who didn't like the half shower wall, it felt fancy and we didn't splash any water with the rain flow showerhead! A/C worked great! Free wifi was quick once you figured out how to get in. So thumbs up on the spacious room! Note that this hotel has two towers, I can't remember which one I was in but it overlooked both the pool area, beach and Diamondhead. Pool area was nice and the pool staff even nicer (they even come around to clean your sunglasses!). The comp mai tais were great! The only thing I didn't like was that the you have to pay for the loungers in the infinity pool. If I'm paying a hefty resort fee I should be ok to use the loungers ANYWHERE. I get that you have to pay for the cabanas but the in-pool loungers is a bit junk. Lots of kids in the hot tub (as opposed to the kiddie pool) so we didn't go in. But the infinity pool is quite nice. Used the gym, brand new equipment (lifecycles brand) and it was empty when I went down at 6am. I didn't use very many machines but I was impressed. Had breakfast at Lychee. While it's a bit steep for the buffett ($39 all inclusive) the food is a nice variety , portions are not huge so that you are wasting and the staff are super nice too. I quite enjoyed the Kalbi loco moco, the Japanese curry and the bear claw pastry. The miso soup was nice as well (make your own).Bellman are super helpful and it's nice to see such friendliness when you arrive and depart. Also tried the new Morimotos. I like the new concept that it won't break the bank. We had the pork belly pupus and the ribs pupus. Then we split the whole fish. It was very good and we liked the pupus the best.Overall, we had a super nice stay and very much enjoyed our time without the kids!

Check-in was friendly and smooth. I had prepaid for our room (ocean view), but as is the way with many hotel/resorts in the USA, I had to pay a resort fee per day for a few things that really should be included in the tariff e.g. wifi, some plastic foldable water bottles, in room coffee maker with coffee and tea pods, surfboard storage! The lobby is shiny and light, and leads down to the O bar with a huge aquarium. They are obviously building up the number of fish. We had our complimentary mai tai's in the bar. The staff member was a little bit abrupt, but served up a nice drink. The singer we heard was great.The corridor carpeting is really odd - at first glance it looks worn or disintegrating, but then you realise it is the pattern of the carpet. Quite strange.The ""Ocean View"" room we had was on the 21st floor, with a balcony, which had an obstructed view of the water due to the hotel next door. It also had an obstructed view of Diamond Head. I'm not that fussed about views, but if you really want to see the beach, make sure you ask specifically.We had 2 queen beds, which were very soft. Lots of pillows. Quilts were necessary as the airconditioning was very powerful (and noisy). We ended up turning it off at night (and it is summer currently) and just sleeping with a sheet. The curtains didn't really black out, so we woke up before 6am each morning.The bathroom is divided into a sink area which is essentially open to the room, with super bright backlighting that really shows up everything, and a tiny toilet/shower/bath area. The shower was in the bath, which I dislike, but the non-stick bath surface was reassuring and the curved shower curtain rail was clever. The shower had good pressure. Hawaii has very soft water, so don't use too much shampoo or soap.Wifi was OK, not superfast, and the TV had lots of channels.The infinity pool looked nice, and there were lots of people laying about on the provided beds, and using the pool bar. Busy area. We tried a couple of times to book massages, but they were booked out.

The rooms are fresh and modern and the pool area is lovely. We stayed in the smaller of the two towers and had the most amazing view of the beach. It was so nice just to be able to check the surf from our window, jump in the lift and straight over the road onto the beach. Other plus points include a conveniently located ABC store in the hotel, great for buying a bottle of wine to drink watching the sunset on the balcony. Also, the free surf board racks are great as they enable you to hire a board for a few days (PS the boards are cheaper and better from the hire shops near the hotel rather than on the beach).What’s not so good? Not a lot, but the pool bar is a bit pricey, so even though it’s a lovely area, we didn’t spend much time there. Also, we stayed during the grand hotel opening. There was a lot of disruption for the big pool party they raved on about on social media. We were annoyed because despite the disruption guests didn’t get invited...or even a token free drink gesture to celebrate or compensate. Seeing as a hotel should be all about the guests, it’s a bit disappointing they have their attention focused elsewhere. Overall, we had a really great time and would love to return to this hotel and the beautiful island of Oahu.","Freshwater, Australia","wwwazzzz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Freshwater, Australia</strong>",17,4.0

We had a great time because we booked a premium ocean front room and it made the difference because of the direct ocean front view. We were unable to have an upgrade to a higher floor room from the 14th to the 17th. The traffic noise directly below Kalakawa and the gardeners' leave blowers started before 7am :( It was not pleasant when we wanted to sleep through from 11p till at least 9am but overall the view from the room lessened our irritability.Pros: 1/ Convenient location, ocean front room views superb.2/ Great front desk welcome- wonderful attentive front desk staff: Special Recognition to Alanna and front desk mgr. Wade who understood our request and honored it; this made us feel we had the real Hawaiian welcome :)3/ Great housekeepers: Special Recognition to Julita, Kim, and our regular housekeeper on #1425, room always kept cleaned and toiletry requests always granted.4/ Poolside mgr. Niki Uylit: great hospitality welcome, hard working, diligent on explaining cabana use rules but sincere and genuine with her aloha welcome.5/ Restaurant Morimoto Asia was quite wonderful, will definitely return, see my review on restaurant.Cons:1/ Some high noise level with rooms facing directly above Kalakawa St2/ Bathroom only has one sink, considering ocean front premium room price & tiltle, should have 2 sinks!! No bath tubs and only half shower door with open flooding to the floor, no hand held shower head available, not up the iPreferred Hotel Chain Asian Standard as a 4-5 Stars Hotel!!3/ No Ladies Bathroom Amenities, no shower caps etc, had to call for them; there were 3 of us, only 1 set of shampoo, conditioner, and soap, no bath soap or gel until after 2 nd night, and I had to ask. 4/ Housekeepers were great, but all toilteries for 3 should have been standard supplies for premium room guests or members of i Preferred Group.5/ Elevators on Oceanside closes door way too fast, almost closed on children and very easily missing the elevator doors being opened. So watch out.4/ Adult Pool and Jacuzzi always have kids, made us not want to swim in the infinite pool worrying about kids'bodily waste. Should have id bands for all guests & kids belong to kids pool.5/ Guest Service Phone Connection- I have to wait a long time on the Guest Service line in order to transfers me to housekeeper every day tell them we were leaving the room and for requests, but the transfers were all to front desk, not housekeepers. This needed to change as front desk were always be busy and guests waiting at front desk, and on phone lines, a very rush feeling.Despite all the cons evaluation, we would like to revisit this hotel again in the near future.

At best this hotel is a gussied up 3 star. Not even close to a 4 or 5 star. Pros: *Location is great, right across the beach and within walking distance to many Waikiki attractions (International Marketplace, Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, etc.) *There's a massive indoor saltwater aquarium*Live music every night in the bars*Restaurant/bar (Julius, Tiffany, Allison, Mike) and Front Desk staff (Andrea, Barbi) very nice, helpful, and friendly Cons: *Shower design is horrendous. There is no curtain or sliding door--just a half panel of glass so water is CONSTANTLY flooding the rest of the bathroom. Who in their right mind approved this design???*Lack of toiletries. You go to ANY other 5 star--or even 4 star--property and you get much, much more. Body Wash. Toothbrushes w/toothpaste. Mouthwash. None of that here. *No room service. This is BASIC for any 4 or 5 star (heck even 3 star!!!!) hotels*No SIT DOWN ala carte breakfast options. Yes, that's right. Their ONLY table service breakfast option is BUFFET ONLY (and overpriced at that). They do have grab 'n go options available but NO sit down ala carte breakfast anywhere. That's right, no pancakes, Belgian waffles, omelets, American breakfasts, etc. etc. Just a $39 per person buffet. *NO REGULATION AT THE INFINITY POOL AND JACUZZI. This goes for two major issues. First, there is a TON of kids in the both areas, and when I say kids, I mean toddlers in diapers. Second, there are A LOT of people not even staying in the hotel that are using the pool because they have NO IDENTIFICATION METHODS. So, if you're ok with paying $350+ per night and are perfectly happy with people not paying a dime and still having access to an amenity that you're paying for, this might be the place for you*Bell and valet staff. Extremely curt, rude, unfriendly, etc. No greeting when dropping off our car. No ""Have a good day"" etc. when picking up our car. Almost no interaction when bringing our bags up to the room. The most words were said when the bellman received their tip, and even then it was just a mumbled ""thank you"". *Staff interaction on property. You go to ANY 4 or 5 star property and staff (housekeeping, maintenance, security, etc.) will regularly greet you and acknowledge you when just walking around. Not here. Can't count how many times we passed staff just walking about with their heads down, looking at their phones, etc. Most of them aren't even aware of the guests walking around them. No holding open of doors either. SMH*They bill themselves as family friendly but there are not many things to keep kids occupied other than the pool and aquarium. There are several more cons, but I think I covered my biggest pet peeves. I am not one to really complain or voice concerns, but I couldn't let this one go. Keep in mind that this was my 8th trip to Oahu. I've stayed twice at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, twice at the Sheraton Waikiki, once at Aulani, once at the Royal Hawaiian, and once at the Moana Surfrider so I'm using those properties for comparison. In time, perhaps Alohilani can get to where they want to be, but they have a loooooooong way to go.","Los Angeles, California","CaliStylz818</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",14,2.0

She is an asset to this hotel. Efficient, warm and friendly. She also followed up with a phone call an hour after we had checked in to ensure that everything was ok. We booked an oceanview room and I had requested a high floor. We stayed on the 17th floor in the front tower which was the top floor. From our lanai we had sweeping views across Waikiki Beach, the pool deck below and mountains in the distance. I would often sit out on the lanai and take in the beautiful view.My sister in law also came on this trip and stayed in the tower behind. Her view was just as magical with views to Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach.The location of the hotel served us well. Situated across the road from Waikiki Beach and within walking distance the shops, restaurant and transport.We utilized the pool on many occasions. The pool staff were super friendly.

We paid for an Ocean View King room.  The room had an ocean view, from the side! We were actually looking into two other hotels. We paid $262.50US per night including all taxes (so we thought!!) 16 nights 6 months in advance from Australia.  BUT what you don't get told is about the resort fee tax that is payable on arrival!! This is a new tax the Hawaii has introduced and to say the least….it sucks! It added an extra $35US + tax (5%) per night. So another $582US had to be paid at check-in.  So now our special rate isn't looking so special anymore - an average room will set you back around $330US per night.There's no mini bar but there is a fridge and American pod coffee machine which you can buy at Walmart next to Ala Moana shopping centre as you only get 2 a day and they won't give you more.  This resort also does not offer room service meals of any kind. No laundry or dry cleaning service, there's a DIY laundry available instead.It's not cheap here, but it is one of the cleanest.  It used to be the old Pacific Beach Hotel which was only a 2-3 star. It's still owned by the same people, some of the staff have been here for over 10 years. It's simply a new paint job and higher prices than it used to be.The location you cannot fault. Opposite the beach and walking distance to bars, shopping and restaurants.  The biggest downfall is the service trucks and leaf blowers that start up at 6am 7 days a week. We were on level 11 and the street noise is shocking. You'll be entertained all night with the horrible music that plays non stop from the resort's restaurant on the street below. After 2 weeks here we were ready to cut their power!The Room - very basic. No folio book to tell you if you can even order room service, pool hours, what's available in the hotel or how to use the tv? Nothing.  The only condiments in the room is shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and a bar or soap. Not even shower gel or a shower cap.The bathroom is small. You have to shimmy between the door and toilet to get into the shower. There's an electric toilet but all it does is heats the seat. It basically doesn't work. You still have to lift the lid and flush it yourself.  The air-conditioning is loud and is set to automatically come on and off, you can't control it. Off is the only choice - but there's no 'on’ button so it's easier not to touch it. It's on automatic and when it comes on it's like a Freight Train coming through your room.  We had a king bed which was very comfortable. Hotel Bars - don't bother. A standard middy of beer at the bar will set you back $13US + tax. It's cheaper in Australia.The concierge does not belong to the hotel, it's owned by Expedia which keeps the excursion and car rental costs down. So don't ask them anything about the hotel they don't know. But they will organise excursions easier and cheaper.Pool - beautiful pool and heated spa. BUT don't try and set yourself up in a cabana by the pool they are an additional cost! Yep after paying  $330US per night for a standard room now you get charged for using the pool facilities. We asked why we are paying a Resort fee each night and we still have to pay to use the pool...no answer! Just set-up on a poolside lounge instead. But again don't sit on the lounges directly in the pool, you have to pay for those too! I also didn't like the fact the pool is not key restricted which means anyone on the street can walk up and use the hotel pool, which they do.  Locals use the pool as their own. I find that weird considering this hotel is trying to be 5 star? Maybe this is standard in Hawaii??VIP nights! This hotel holds functions for external organisations and hotel guests are banned from going all over the grounds during this time. Lobby, lobby bar and pool are all out of bounds from mid afternoon until midnight.  One of these functions held a pool side function with a DJ poolside who played “doof doof” nightclub music until 10pm flat out and it's only Tuesday! Customers are not made aware and calling reception falls on deaf ears! They've got my money I'm no longer important to them!  Week 2 we were poolside and at 3pm the staff started removing the deck chairs and blocking the pool off because yet again another private function was being held at 6pm. So pool and bar were now out of bounds to guests again. This place is just downright rude!","Perth, Western Australia","kimbo767</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Western Australia</strong>",47,3.0

I was so torn by the reviews I just didn't know what to expect. It looked so nice yet very few people had anything nice to say.We booked and we loved it. It was not perfect, but for the price and location (being slightly out of the crazy tourist area), it was absolutely perfect.Check in was a breeze and the staff were lovely. We did seem to get lucky with our arrival time though as throughout our stay, check in seemed to always have long lines.Our room was small but not tiny, the view of Diamond Head was AMAZING!! and we could also see the beach. The bathroom had been renovated, but nothing to get excited about. Speaking renovations, they could have spent a little more and replaced the popcorn ceilings and sliding doors as they both dated the room somewhat.The pool area was so much larger than we expected so we were pleasantly surprised at that, although this was probably our most disappointing part of the hotel as nothing seemed to work here.The towel staff were inattentive, the childrens pool was empty as all the kids were in the adult pool (which was FREEZING cold) and the food service was appalling. Needless to say, we spent the majority of our chill out time down on the beach.The final reason for only 4 and not 5 was the night before we left, we asked about a cab to the airport. We were told no need to book, just come down in the morning. When we did go down in the morning, we were told that we should have booked and it would be at least 45mins. After some harsh words, one of the staff walked down the street and hailed us a cab.Not enough to put us off though.

I had to go and buy my own black tea. You can make your own hot water using pod machine I found this out from staff after going downstairs asking for hot water on more than one occasion - free local calls from room Problems encountered - hotel two days in a row was charging my credit card an extra $374 and couldn’t tell me why. I had to ring my bank back in Australia who then spoke to front desk management to sort it out- housekeeping first couple of days was good then downhill. - my child’s comforter disappeared. I realized it must have got caught up in the linen when they Stripped the bed. I reported to housekeeping and after following up on more than one occasion reported to front desk. This comforter was sentimental as my mum gave it to my son as a baby before she passed away. Didn’t even get an apology from staff. - overcharged for washing machine. $8 instead of $3 but was rectified after complaining to front desk. The machine doesn’t wash that well either- no place in room to hang up wet bathers- asked conceirge to book sealife Park. They did but then I found out it was buy one ticket get one free for fathers. This discount was not passed in to me. Instead of $40 refund I’ve been advised i will get $20 due to transfers which I understood to be free. Unfortunately I encountered too many problems for the money I paid. For a couple this hotel is great. Do your research for activities though. Waikiki is become quiet expensive. Some staff are friendly. Mackenzie in concerige was great. When I reported to management they did sound sincere and tried following up further with my lost comforter but still missing.

I complained a little over this and the management recognised the problems and made appropriate offers which was unexpected but very acceptable.

Every time you open the door, it falls off. - All room doors on our floor slammed shut, even if we tried to close it carefully. Anytime any door on the floor closed, it sounded like a bomb was going off... several times a day. - Bathroom is very small. You have to stand way inside to close the door for privacy. Half the counter is not accessible because the toilet is in the way. The showerhead often malfunctioned; it was difficult to control both the flow and temperature. The drain in the shower did not drain well -- water was above the ankles by the end of a shower. There were no amenities (toothpaste, toothbrush, etc) like the Pacific used to have. No clothesline to hang wet swimsuits in the shower area -- another thing we've lost.  - No small sofa in Ocean Front King Room, even though it was on the website in photos. There was only one chair -- what were we supposed to do? Play musical chairs? - No clock in the room -- another loss. There used to be an electric clock radio with alarm, and now there is not. Once again, you are paying MORE for LESS. - Table in room has a round base which makes it impossible to extend our legs when seated. Must keep your legs bent at all times when seated at the table.  - A pole lamp in the room blocks view of the TV. - There used to be a cabinet in the corner for coffeemaker and refrigerator. It made a great food prep area. Now the refrigerator is under the TV and the coffeemaker is next to the TV at the opposite end. With the refrigerator being in the cabinet under the tv, space for clothing is reduced.  - Cabinet with the TV -- I broke several fingernails while trying to open the drawers. You need to have really tiny fingers to open the drawers. - There used to be a vanity in the room, which provided an additional area for personal care. That has been removed, and now it is an empty useless space. There is ample space for a vanity or cabinet or shelving, which is much-needed, given how small the bathroom is. - DECOR - nothing Hawaiian about it. Three different kinds of wood were used, and none of it matches. Knotty pine, white-washed. Looks like something you would see in an antique shop in Texas, not Hawaii. Three kinds of marble was used; none match. Small table on the deck looked like someone left their toolbox behind. It looked dirty and bloody. The only way we could use it was to put a towel over it. It was disgusting. Nightstands on each side of the bed appeared to be filthy, but it was part of the décor (?). The headboard looked like a horse stall. The art on the wall was colorless and not attractive at all. There is very little color in the room. The décor in NO WAY reflects the Aloha Spirit.  - It was nearly impossible to find the pool area. The only signs were in Japanese. We teamed up with several other hotel guests, 6 or 7 of us roaming the hallways, trying to find the pool.  - When it was time to leave (we had already paid in full), we called 30 minutes ahead to have bell-hop service for our luggage. They never showed up, so we had to schlepp our bags down by ourselves and almost missed our shuttle. Thankfully, our shuttle waited an extra 10 minutes, or we would have missed our flight.+ PLUSES + - the mattress -- very comfortable. - the lamps at side of bed were nice. - the floral fragrance pumped in to the lobby area was very pleasant and soothing.We used to be regular guests at the Pacific Beach hotel. But now we will never stay there again.The rooms are over-priced and in no-way represent a 5-star resort. It was disappointing to see NOTHING of Hawaiian culture or history in the rooms.","Santa Cruz, California","Barbara M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Cruz, California</strong>",11,1.0

You're right in the heart of Waikiki. The beach is right across the street. Tiki's is right next door. Everything you want is literally steps away. The staff at check-in was kind enough and placed us in a tower with a view. Now the negatives, oh where do I begin...1. The refrigerator was leaking.2. I called the front desk three times and no one picked up. I finally called a fourth time and was finally able to reach someone. Two if I recall correctly, there were no other buttons or shortcuts on the phone to call anyone else but the Operator/Front Desk.3. They never refilled the shampoo upon servicing/cleaning the room.4. There was no clock! How is this possible at a 5 star resort? I have no idea. I've never been in a hotel room without a clock. 5. The towels had stains on them. (photos attached)6. Counters were dirty.7. No room service. I would assume a 5 star hotel would have some sort of food. But no, on the desk inside the room there is a menu from a Pizza joint nearby. It's not exactly what you think of when you hear it's a 5 star resort. In comparison to other 5 star (even 3 star resorts), while the following aren't deal breakers, they stand out:7. No water bottles offered in the room.8. After using the ironing board, Housekeeping never moved the ironing board back. Not a major concern but in my experience most 3 star hotels usually tidy up a bit for you. Important questions to ask:What happened to the rest of the reviews on here? I've seen many reviews of this hotel before on here before but all the sudden the hotel only has 25 reviews and the oldest review is 2 weeks old? How is that possible?Lastly, I'm really curious to know how this hotel achieve a 5 star designation. Most 3 star hotels I've stayed at easily surpass this hotel in almost every way. Even some 2.5 star hotels.","San Diego, California","HiTravel1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",11,2.0

Twice a day you can see a diver go into the giant aquarium and feed the fish! They have 2 pools here, a keiki pool and an infinity pool that over looks Waikiki Beach. The infinity pool has comfy lounge seats in the pool, but we were told that they were available for rent. Sitting in the hot tub after a dip in the cool pool was a nice touch as waitresses offered a full menu of drinks and food. Right across the street you have access to a part of Waikiki beach that has a break, so it is perfect for kids to play in.

If you know Honolulu its rare a hotel gets a reburb. 7 Nights booked an ocean view and the first room we were given was ocean view but the other side of the hotel overlooking another hotel and its car-park more of a side view of the ocean. Spoke to reception stating the site is very misleading to provide ocean view of one side of the hotel but there is 2 sides of the hotel that is ocean view. They did try up sell me ocean front but I was not going to pay anymore I just wanted the view I paid for. They did move us to a room with the view I expected. Those other so call ocean view rooms should be re-named and photographed with their view and a slightly lower rate. 5 Stars the reception and pool area YES takes your breath away the grandness of the entrance of the hotel, but the rooms modern but I don't feel I'm in a 5 star hotel. Not really worried about mini bars but you should have bottled water in the fridge for your guests, considering hefty resort fees 2 bottles of water a day wont break the bank and telling us to fill up around the resort with the taps available with the water bottles provided is not 5 star. Meeting other guests around the pool having general chit chat they too agree bottled water should be in the fridge as a minimum. Kids pool disconnected from the infinity pool so I got no service down there not one server came near me to see if you want drink or food. I had to get my child out of the pool go up to the bar and ask for drink. The lounge area amazing especially when the music in the afternoon starts great vibes. I will mention there is no security in the hotel so anyone can enter the lift and go up to any floor and soon found out that a few people around the pool were from other hotels and come to this hotel daily to swim in the pool. How do you find out kids dont lie. Word of mouth is apparently out that this hotel you can access their pool. I personally think the hotel needs to put a room key access to all floors for security and also to keep the pool exclusive to their guests. The location you cannot fault across the road from beach.
