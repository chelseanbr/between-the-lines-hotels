It’s also in the flower district, so it’s like walking through a garden heading to or from the hotel. The front desk has been super friendly & helpful. The room is very clean and modern. I love that the floors in the rooms are all hard surface (no carpet). It’s a little small, but then again it’s NYC, so that’s a given.

We were also traveling with a little baby, and after a very early morning flight he was very tired and we were desperate for a hotel we could check into early. After calling Fairfield Inn and speaking with Kellen Sears he assured us we could come right in and check in. It was such a relief. When we got there he took care of us right away and even offered us to have breakfast, which we were so grateful for because after 5 hours of traveling we were hungry! We had a wonderful room that was very clean and had everything we needed. After a nice warm breakfast my husband and my little baby and I all had a wonderful much needed nap before we started our day! Kellen was always so friendly and helpful and really exemplifies what an A+ customer service person should be! The rest of the staff including Janessa and a few others we came in contact with were so friendly and accommodating. It was really a breath of fresh air. The hotel it in a wonderful area in the city with tons of stuff near by and we enjoyed our walks around the area! We truly truly appreciate all the help and accommodations and friendly service and will 100% be back during our next visit to New York!",Elizabeth,"Katrinakubicina</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Elizabeth</strong>",0,5.0

The room was furnished in typical Fairfield Inn style (though this is a standard sized hotel room, not a suite.) The room was exceptionally clean. A small annoyance was the bathroom door was too big and you had to navigate your way around it and the toilet. The breakfast was typically good, and the breakfast area can get very crowded. Checking in was amazingly fast, and they did everything right for my Platinum level from gift/points to room upgrade (this was a nice surprise for a Marriott property lately).","marlboro, New Jersey, USA","mkbnj</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>marlboro, New Jersey, USA</strong>",33,5.0

This is one of 4 or 5 mid-range chain hotels on the same block that are all relatively new. We got a really good rate over Super Bowl weekend, and I just got gold Bonvoy status so we were upgraded to a somewhat bigger room. Overall, this was the best value stay I've had in Manhattan in at least 20 years.Everything in the room worked, the staff was friendly and helpful, and the breakfast is the standard Fairfield Inn breakfast, which I think is the best free breakfast in this class.

The hotel is a great location. Just south of Penn Station in a floral district. There are a few other hotels on this block so the street was fairly quiet after dark. There’s a subway stop at the end of the block along with a drug store for last minute essentials. Check in was very quick and all the staff we encountered were incredibly friendly. Also have us a free bottle of water upon checkin. The room is modern, clean and small. It’s Manhattan so you have to expect it. They made great use of all the space but we just ran out of room to put our stuff so we just made the best of it. Bed was super comfy. Plenty of channel on the TV and the shower had great water pressure. My only complaint? Not enough power outlets. We had phones, apple watches and a CPAP machine to plug in at night and there was only one outlet near the beds. We made due but in this day and age, outlets near the bed are a must. They offered a free breakfast each more which we had on two of the three mornings we were there. Nothing to brag about...plenty of offerings for everyone. They had Starbucks coffee which was nice. Overall, a nice visit. I would definitely recommend this hotel and come back next time I’m staying in NYC.

The hotel is in walking distance to the Times Square, to Macy’s and to the Empire State Building. There are 2 subway stations at the 2 corners of the 28th street (both are only some steps from the hotel). In addition Pen station is only 5 blocks from here. We went to see Nets in Barclays center in Brooklyn. Getting there took half an hour with subway R. We went to see Giants the other day in MetLife stadium. It took only 50 minutes to get there by train from Pen station. However we went to have a morning running session in the Central Park and Central Park is 30 blocks away which is a lot. It would have been better to take one of the subway to get to the Central Park first. The complimentary breakfast is delicious and there are a nice variety of cold and hot dishes but during the rush hours (after 8 am) it is almost impossible to have a chair and there is a long row for the food. It happened that scrambled egg and bacon have ran out and their replacement took more than 10 minutes. On the other hand before 7.30 am everything is just perfect for a relaxed and nice breakfast. Our room was small but clean. However I have been a Goldelite member of Marriott Bonvoy for already 3 years and I am eligible for an upgrade we have received a room below standard. The sink was seriously leaking and it took 2 days for the hotel to make it fixed though we reported it upon arrival. Our first 2 days were really uncomfortable because we could not use the sink. Receptionist told us that there was no other room available. The staff was nice but really overburdened. At the reception there was usually only one guy who was also the concierge also.I think we may go back again because the pros are still overtaken the cons.","Central Hungary, Hungary","Janos1315</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Central Hungary, Hungary</strong>",92,3.0

Yes the room are , in typical NY fashion, on the small side but even as a family with young children we didn’t spend much time in the room.What I most want to mention though is just how awesome this hotel is for families. The staff behind the reception, the breakfast room staff and even the doormen are so incredibly friendly and welcoming to children. We traveled in October with our 5 year old, 3 year old and young baby. They gave the children cookies on arrival to welcome them to the hotel and city. They had movie afternoons where they’d put out snacks and the children felt like they were in a movie theatre. The staff would chat and play with the children and just made you feel welcome. They even made little bags of snacks and wrote us a letter thanking us for staying when we left - so thoughtful.My husband and I have been to nyc several time before having children but this was their first visit and I wouldn’t hesitate to book the Fairfield again.

We arrived to check in around 2pm and we were told it would be 5-10 minutes before the room was ready. Then after that it would be another 5-10 minutes before the room was ready. We hadn't had lunch yet and we were getting quite hungry. We offer to leave and come back later, but we were told, no really it will be another 5-10 minutes. Time after time there were fake promises for the room to be ready. It took us an HOUR before the room was ready. Needless to say we didn't eat lunch til 3:30pm. The room seemed nice until I took a shower. When I turned on the water my feet made the floor of the bath tub black. It happened every time we took a shower. Being that we were wearing shoes & socks it wasn't city dirt. Please mop the floor of your rooms because they were gross. Breakfast is included, but the best thing about the breakfast was the coffee. The eggs, sausage, waffles, etc didn't look eatable. We thought since we are in NYC the bagels has to be good. Think again. We have no idea where they buy their bagels, but they are NOT anything near a NYC bagel. We couldn't even eat the bagel.

The first night was a little disorganised as they appeared fully booked and we were appointed a disability room that was quite tight for space and had only been set out for one occupant. The problem was sorted thanks to the excellent staff Wendi and Gissell who were both apologetic and could not do enough to make our stay memorable. Once moved we had a large room, with reasonable size shower room. The room appeared to have been refurbished and had wooden floors and modern fitments. There did seem to be an issue with housekeeping as towels were not left and the soap, cream shampoo had to be requested on a number of occasions.Breakfast was part of the package and was plentiful, with quality products that should suffice most residents. There was an excellent supply of fruit and breads.The hotel is in an excellent location within the “flower” district and within easy walking distance of Penn Station and other key areas of NYC.My only other concern is there are no in room safes, with small portable safes available at the front desk. So iPads etc had to be hidden in cases with passports and valuables carried around, which is not ideal! There should be security in the rooms. Thankfully, we did not loose anything during our stay.Overall, it was a comfortable stay, however, due to the safe issue I would reconsider future stays.","London, United Kingdom","handyspanner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",156,4.0

My husband booked a room for me for the night of Wed 5/22 and I extended for tonight, Thurs 5/23 as well.i wanted to share very positive feedback and give praise to one of your team members, Gissell.I was checking out of my room this afternoon & right before I left my room, I found out that my Delta flight home was going to be very delayed and as I spoke to Delta, there was a high likelihood that it would get cancelled or ""timed out"" (crew can't work any further) given delays due to rainstorms, so backed up air traffic.I was in the lobby and happened to explain my dilemma to Gissell who was managing the front desk. I wondered out loud, ""do I go to the airport and take a chance that my flight would actually leave tonight? Or do I stay another night here in NYC and take the bus home tomorrow?"" Gissell kindly let me know that she had one room left available for tonight if I chose to stay and not try to go to the airport. The room available would be my room that I had last night!Finally, after consulting with my husband, talking to him from the hotel lobby, I decided to stay one more night - he booked the room with points and I went back to the front desk to get my keys ... to my same room as last night!I was so appreciative that my room was available and Gissell showed empathy for the trouble I had to go through in deciding to try to fly home or not. (A lot of time waiting on hold to talk to Delta)!Gissell welcomed me back and expressed empathy for my trouble and clearly stated she was happy that I was going to stay another night. Very kind and professional which was what I needed after sitting and deciding what to do.But there is more ...I went up to my room and soon after i entered the room, there was a knock at the door - a young man brought a small basket with goodies - KIND bars, water, some chips, a few candies. SO UNEXPECTED and very appreciated!The basket had a handwritten lovely note from Gissell stating she was sorry that I had to go through so much trouble today and hoped that this basket of goodies would lighten my day a bit. I was so touched.Gissell went WAY ABOVE AND BEYOND in terms of making me feel welcome and I have to say, I have rarely ever experienced such 10-star service in all the years I have traveled for work and for fun.My husband and I are loyal Marriott & Marriott brand consumers and when I called to tell him about this basket of treats, he was amazed.We have lived in Asia and Europe, have stayed in VERY expensive hotels and spa hotels and we can't recall when such a generous gesture was made. This makes me feel highly appreciated as a guest and makes me highly likely to return to this Fairfield hotel when I travel to NYC for work or for fun. This was an amazing gesture and I am thankful for Gissell's professionalism and warm smile and generosity.i will be back to this location soon and I hope to see her again.Thank you for having team members like Gissell in the Marriott family.

Our stay a few days ago was our second one.Thanks to my husband's loyalty status with Marriott we were able to secure a room on a high floor during both of our stays. The room size is typical for NYC. What I love about it is that it's newly renovated, it's carpet-free, it has floor-to-ceiling windows, and the shower has glass partitions instead of a tub with shower curtains.The front desk staff is what sets it apart from all the other NYC hotels we've stayed in. They're very warm and very pleasant despite the always-busy small lobby filled with guests who are always in need of something. Shoutout to Roxanne who thoughtfully prepared a welcome basket for us and to Giselle who gave us a great dining alternative!The breakfast is standard American breakfast offered by hotels in the same price point and it's free.The hotel is located on the same street as wholesale florists. There's a subway station at the end of the block (Times Square is two stops away), Herald Square and Penn station are a short walk away, and there's a Walgreens nearby for essentials. There's a ramen place, a Korean BBQ place, an Italian restaurant, even a McDonald's just a stone's throw away.Please note that there are several buildings under construction on their block so some portions of the street only have one lane open, this made it difficult to maneuver our SUV into their valet spot. Plus the florists can make a mess on the sidewalk when they're cleaning. Other than that this is really the perfect choice for us in Manhattan and will be our regular base when traveling to NYC.",New Hampshire,"TheresaRos</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Hampshire</strong>",33,5.0

Usually I won’t bother with the room size unless I feel it’s really too small, especially when the front desk told me they gave me a larger room. I really don’t know how it feels to be in their standard room which stated only 180 sqft.Second, I couldn’t find the mini fridge anywhere in the room, so I called the front desk, the staff told me they will only deliver it upon request. Never heard of any hotel handle the hotel mini-fridge this way. Third, when I found no trash can under the desk, I was wondering if that is also delivered upon request? Called again, no, it’s just that the housekeeper forgot to put one under the desk. Of course, toothbrush is also provided upon request, but the front desk staff didn’t mention anything when checked in, you’ll just have to find all those missing things one by one yourself.During the two hours waiting time for the room ready for check in, I found there’s only one front desk staff taking care of everything, when the hotel customers left luggages at the counter for storage, she had to carry all those luggages to the storage room, while she’s doing that job, nobody is presented at the counter, people had to wait until she finished the luggage job which should be done by the concierge or bell boy. It just occurred to me the Fairfield by Marriott seems like running by a family, such a limited working personnel at this hotel.Lastly, when inquiring all those housekeeping related questions, like coffee maker didn’t work, missing trash can, toothbrush, etc. etc. there’s no direct line, had to go through the front desk, so when front desk staff is busy, you have to wait until they’re done with their work at the front desk. It’s indeed very inconvenient especially when you need something right away. The guy who delivered the coffee maker, trash can and toothbrush to my room for several times, I could feel he became impatient at the end, but all those things I asked for should have been provided in the room without even asking, furthermore, I was kind enough not to ask for the mini-fridge to be delivered to my room when I actually needed one.Anyway, Interesting experience at this hotel, but that’s it, bye bye!",,Ginniefan5188,11,3.0

The hotel itself is a typical tall, skinny Manhattan hotel crammed into a small footprint, so there are only a handful of rooms per floor. I was on a pretty low floor (the ninth), but noise from outside wasn't too intrusive at all. The staff here is extremely nice and helpful and my room was very clean and comfortable. I skipped the free breakfast on both mornings of my stay, as there are so many great places for breakfast and superior cappuccino nearby. But I really appreciated the hotel's living room in the back of the lobby, where there is seating and free coffee/tea/water provided all day long.

The stay did not go as expected. 1.I arrived too early on the first night and there was no room available for early check-in because, according to the front desk, half of the hotel rooms were under renovation. She told me that she'd let me know when the room became available. The notification came at around 7pm. This could have been an issue with the Marriott App? However, while I do understand that this is based on availability,I had requested the early check-in prior to the stay, so I would have appreciated if I was told that this was not likely to happen beforehand. 2.The next day, I found a centipede (a baby centipede, according to the personnel who came to take care of it) in the shower. To be fair, he offered to switch the room for me, but he confirmed that it's not harmful, so I decided not to switch and he made sure that I get the room cleaning later that afternoon. 3.I was going to make coffee in the room only to find that one of the coffee packages has already passed the expiration date...4.On the third day, I asked for a late checkout (guaranteed benefit for Platinum) so that I could take a shower after a workout before I leave but received a notice the day before that the water will be shut off from 11am to 4pm... Had I known this before the stay, I would have stayed at a different hotel and my reservation had been eligible for the chance / cancellation without fee until 4pm the day before. Anyways, I ended up checking out early and took a shower at the gym (not hotel). 5.Also, all throughout the stay, the street noise was considerable so I recommend that you stay on higher floors. There are some good things about the hotel as well. The location was the reason that I chose this hotel in the first place. The people at the front desk are generally friendly. They have free breakfast. The room was clean and didn't have carpeted floor. The room was relatively large; It was at the end of the hallway right next to the closet - maybe it has to do with it? Downside was that there was noise coming from that closet from early in the morning. The check-out process was quick and easy (even though they didn't ask how the stay was).

We first arrived at the hotel early in the morning by taking a short walk from Penn Station. The lady at the front desk was pleasant and offered to hold our luggage for us until check in. We went back to the hotel later in the day to check in and found the process to be quick and efficient. Our room was nice and newly renovated. I love hotel rooms that don’t have carpet, and each day the housekeeper did an outstanding job making the room spotless and tidy. We found the mattress and pillows to be perfectly comfortable. The breakfast is your typical Fairfield fare. The variety was good enough, but I doubt it could hurt to have plain unsweetened yogurt as an option. The eggs in these settings can be hit or miss, but we found them to be delicious each morning. We enjoyed the coffee, too. The breakfast room is small, but that's to be expected. We didn’t find overcrowding in the breakfast area to be an issue during our stay.The hotel also has a rooftop patio. Unfortunately, there are huge ventilation fans running up there that are so loud you can’t have a conversation. The rooftop patio is basically only good for going up to check the weather and maybe taking a few photos.The biggest complaint of our stay at this hotel involved the restrooms in the lobby. When first arriving, after having flown across the country all night on a red eye, I had hoped to freshen up and wash my face before going about the day. I was unpleasantly surprised to find the restroom in the lobby didn’t have any soap. Instead there was a mark on the wall where the soap dispenser looked to have been torn off. This restroom was also next to the breakfast area, so it was disconcerting that people probably used this restroom before handling food. The toilet looked as though it hadn’t been cleaned in a week. There turned out to be another restroom around the corner, and as I waited for what seemed like an eternity for it to become vacant, one of the breakfast attendants told me to go back and use the same restroom I had just been in. When I told him it didn’t have any soap, he looked at me like “so what” and went about his business. When that second restroom finally became vacant, I was relieved to see there was soap in there. But as luck would have it there weren’t any more paper towels. I’ve generally found Marriott lobby restrooms to be in great condition, but the ones at this property majorly missed the mark.All in all I’d still recommend this hotel.

We parked the car. I walked H.C. to his breakfast meeting spot on the far west side and continued my walk cross-town, with my suitcase in tow so as to drop it at the hotel on my way to my office. I arrived at the hotel’s front desk and was greeted immediately by the clerk who took my bag to store it until the afternoon and invited me to have breakfast with them even though our check-in was not until that afternoon. My stomach had been growling the whole walk east, and the smell from the breakfast buffet just off the lobby was enticing. The prospect of some warm scrambled eggs and fresh fruit was too much for me to turn down. I grabbed a newspaper and settled in at a corner table, enjoying the warmth of the delicious eggs and the chill of the fruit. In ten minutes, I was good to go to my office.I find this hotel perfectly fine for a night or two. If you are a light sleeper, I strongly suggest requesting a room not facing 28th Street as the traffic noise continues well into the early hours of the morning. That noise is soon replaced by the noise of early-arriving trucks delivering the day’s flowers to the Flower District. Essentially, it is almost never quiet.

Room was covered in body-sized carpet stains, broken plugs, unvacuumed corners, a vanity “light” that offered no light and a disheveled lamp with a broken outlet. Did I report it? No. Why? Because usually these problems aren’t symptomatic of a bad room but rather a bad property. And on a two-night stay you just tough it out and remember for next time. (The bed was clean and sleepable.) Also poorly designed- no way to use the bathroom sink unless you walk all the way in the room and close the door behind you. To make matters worse the fitness center was closed for a planned renovation, which was only told to me on check in. The hotel across the street was offering theirs as a replacement, but had the hotel told guests like me this ahead of time I would have made alternate plans as this is a deciding factor for me. The other Fairfield properties I’ve stayed at in NYC were much nicer. Don’t go here.

The staff was quite welcoming and made checking in/out very simple. We were busy showing family around the city, so we pretty much were only in the room to sleep. We therefore didn’t partake in all the hotel’s offerings like breakfast such.

We wanted this area because it's near the Chelsea Flea Market, and it's in the middle of the flower district, which is a lovely, quiet, pretty place to stay. We really liked browsing the flowers.We arrived on a red eye Jet Blue flight so arrived at the hotel at 8am. Naturally, they did not have a room for us, but gladly checked in our bags and invited us to enjoy the buffet. The buffet was average, but the room in the back where it's located in a nice, cozy spot. We were happy to rest there for a few minutes before heading on our way. I had hoped our room might be ready earlier than 3pm...but that did not happen. They promised to call when a room was available, but that didn't happen either. That was really the only downside to our experience.When we DID check in that afternoon, we found a small but clean room. Decent sized bathroom, and an okay sized room (for NYC...as in, small for the rest of the country). We enjoyed breakfast again the next day. The staff was always super friendly when we interacted with them, and that really made a nice impression. The place was clean (some construction was going on, but not a big deal at all). Elevator was even a decent speed!I'd happily stay there again. It's a good location in a lovely part of the city. Flatiron Building is nearby. Macy's and Empire State not too far. Even the HiLine Park is a reasonable walk. Subway station nearby. Cabs come by fairly frequently.

Not much of a view, but definitely room to stretch out and relax. The room has two full baths, a living room, and a separate bedroom with two beds. The internet and showers were excellent. In true NYC fashion, the hotel makes use of every corner of the building. The gym is down in the basement with several treadmills and weight machines, along with the vending and ice machines. The hotel does not have a small store, but a Walgreen's/Duane Reed can be found up the block. The hotel has the typical Marriott breakfast and a small dining area.

I actually kind of booked this hotel by mistake. My friend and I had been going back and forth with options of where to stay and I thought this was where we agreed on, so, I booked it. When we were being dropped off my friend said “this isn’t where we are staying” and I said “yes…it is?” Turned out to be an excellent “mistake”!This isn’t a fancy hotel. You aren’t going to walk in and be wowed by the lobby. It is clean and in a nice location (flower district). It is walking distance to a lot of major attractions (we are big walkers but we really didn’t need to take transit or cabs anywhere and we saw a LOT). What WILL wow you is how truly nice the staff are. The front desk staff when we arrive were friendly and showed genuine interest in us as guests. We were early for check in and they found us a room so we could start our weekend right away. We told them we were in NYC to celebrate my birthday and when we came back after a day of walking we found a bottle of wine one ice with a lovely welcome note. Amazing! The staff in the breakfast area were also all very friendly and welcoming. The rooms are small but, it’s a major city so that is totally expected. It was surprisingly quiet (ask for a room at the back of the building…no view but definitely quieter), not a lot of storage space but for 2 people over a weekend, it was totally manageable. Only downside really would be not having an in room safe or fridge. The included breakfast had way more options than expected and is a VERY nice bonus in an expensive place like New York City.

The hotel room by Manhattan standards was still pretty small. With a two double bed room, there was very little maneuvering room, and even less to park a suitcase. I was disappointed to not see a mini fridge in the room, which would have mattered if my insulin dependent child was with me. There was also a distinct lack of electrical outlets to plug in phones and tablets. If you want ice, you need to head into the basement, where the exercise room was located. When I needed to print something, the single computer station was occupied, and even then, the printer was not functioning. In the middle of January, the room was either too hot with the heat on or too cold with the A/C on. There was no middle ground. Conclusion: a decent if otherwise lacklustre hotel.

Our room, comprising of two double beds and a small bathroom (shower over bath) was fairly depressing with dark furniture and carpeting and drab walls.We overlooked a brick building where it's workers had a direct view into our room when we raised the blinds which meant that during working hours we left both blinds down. Still, you don't stay in your room much during the day so we were fairly resigned about this. We had breakfast (complimentary to guests) at the hotel. I really enjoyed the variety but did note that although there are two rooms accommodating guests these were very cramped at weekends with many people waiting for people to vacate tables. Also, I was disappointed that breakfast finished at 9am (10am weekdays). Why would you do this when the majority of your guests are on holiday? There are no other meals or even a bar at the hotel so what's the rush?We found the hotel easily accessible from Penn Station. It is only one stop on the metro to W28th street but we had quite a bit of luggage and walked down 7th Avenue to 28th which took us only a few minutes - no big deal. With the metro at the end of the street we went to The South Shore for the free Staten Island Ferry and in the other direction to Central Park. - no problems at all. We went to a bar called the Compton Ale House in W27/W26 street which had good beers and food and there is also a cheap laundromat at W26th. All in all, a useful location to be in.

After all, shouldn't have too many negatives for only an one night stay. Unfortunately, I stayed at the Courtyard on W31st the night before, so this hotel's room and especially the bathroom became a major issue for me. When I first try to check in early, I was told that no rooms are available for early in for that day, but I was hopeful that perhaps, someone would double check and see if a complimentary upgrade was available, but no such luck (I guess being a Marriott gold status member won't get any special treatments at this hotel). Instead, they nicely asked me to come back closer to the check in time. Thank goodness I was able to get a late check out from Courtyard. When I return later for the proper check in, I was very disappointed that the room that was assigned to me was not on a higher floor, and was near the elevator. Everything that I do not want on my profile. The young woman at the front desk told me that I was supposedly assigned to a room with the view of the Empire State Bldg., I am sorry to say that the building view I had was not it. So, the room was clean, but there was no floor space to lay my luggage on and the drawer spaces available were maybe 6 - 8 inches to the end of the bed. This wasn't the issue that bothers me the most. It was bathroom vanity space that I am not used to. On top of it, you cannot leave the bathroom door open because the door opens inward and will block out half the vanity space. This means you must close the bathroom door even if you only need to wash your hands.The nice things I could say about this hotel is the location and complimentary breakfast.

I left my credit card at an airport store and my mother-in-law left her license at home, We arranged to have them delivered to the hotel. Jenifer, who was working at the front desk, recognized we were having a tough day and delivered a bottle of champaign to our room with snacks to make the day a bit brighter. She was a great hostess and was very attentive to all the guests needs. The hotel itself is very nice and is located right in the flower wholesale district. The sights of the flowers and the wonderful fragrances emanating from them made for a great walk in the morning as the workers moved the flowers out to the street. There was also a yellow cat who seemed to be the greeter for the hotel on the front porch area.

The rooms are nice and clean. The room had more than enough space for two people and a single suitcase. The bathroom was spacious and updated. It also had a ventilated fan, which it seems like few hotels have. There was no fridge in the room. The complementary breakfast was good. It had an assortment of baked goods, cereal, a waffle maker, fresh fruit, and yogurt. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great spot. We were able to walk to time square and Central Park no problem. We were also close to Madison square garden, which is the reason we came to New York. There were two reasons I didn't give this hotel five stars. First: we planned on doing the valet parking. But, because it had snowed within the week we were here, there was only a single small spot available to park in, and it wasn't cleared. Plus, the valet service is off site, so we would have had to wait about 10 minutes while blocking traffic to valet the car. In nice weather, this probably wouldn't be an issue as a full size spot would be available. We ended up doing the self park, which was cheaper anyway. Second: we left our do not disturb sign on the door when we went out for a couple hours during the day because we didn't want the room disturbed. When we got back, the sign was back inside the room, and it had been cleaned. Nothing was disturbed or taken, but I did find it surprising that the sign was ignored. The hotel can't be blamed for this, but the street noise is extremely loud. We were on the 11th floor, and the horns and sirens woke me up multiple times throughout the night. I recommend bringing ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. ","Ridley Park, Pennsylvania","maggster421</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ridley Park, Pennsylvania</strong>",1,4.0

After our stay we received an email from the operations manager, asking for a feedback. I submitted it, but have never heard back. So now I'm posting my email here:""Thank you so much for writing to me! Staying at your hotel was very pleasant & great! You were able to give us a very early check-in! And from all our hearts we want to thank you! However, there were a couple of things that I wanted to point out:1) The girl at the reception said that parking in your partnering garage facility was $35 flat fee. But she DIDN'T say that this was the price for only 24 hours. I asked if there was any stamp/ticket/validation for the parking garage to ensure they know we're staying at your hotel. The girl said that there was nothing special and we should tell the garage that we're staying at your hotel & if they doubt that, they will just call the hotel. We came to the garage to find out our that we needed a validation from the hotel. I walked back and the new girl placed a sticker on our parking receipt (different girl at the reception). I went back to the garage & were told that price for parking doubled, even though we were only 1.5 hours over the 24-hour mark & had to pay $70 because the girl didn't tell us anything about that. That was supper disappointing for our walet. 2) The same girl at the reception told us that breakfast lasted till 10 am when we arrived. I asked if that was the end time all the time. She said 'Yes'. We woke up this morning & went downstairs at around 9.30 & discovered that breakfast is till 9 am on weekdays & 10 am on weekends. Again, the girl provided the wrong information & that was not what we paid for. Also, there were other people that went downstairs to ask why the breakfast was almost gone & I explained what happened (in from of the reception). They too, were told that breakfast lasted till 10.00 am & were shocked that it was over. So we missed the breakfast & paid double for the parking. The reason why I wanted to stay at your hotel is because the price was great, convenient location for us, good price for parking & free breakfast.All above went downhill except for the location.I never complain about microscopic things, but when something hits our wallet or we don't get what we paid for, then I bring such things up.""There.","Buffalo, New York","Firefoxusa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Buffalo, New York</strong>",33,3.0

Scrambled eggs, some sort of weird sausage patty, English muffins, pastries. If you're trying to eat healthy, this is not where I would plan to eat, as I struggled to find the right mix. Many other Fairfield/Courtyards offer spinach, turkey and other healthy foods - not this one. They did offer soy milk, which I thought was a nice touch. The gym was small - two treadmills, one elliptical and one bike. Ther was one weight bench. At peak hours, it got packed - and a bit contentious about space and who had the weights first, etc. I appreciate the hotel for offering a fitness room, but given the amount of rooms in the hotel, they desperately need to expand the facilities.

Everyday we came and stocked up the tea, creamers, and sugars and cups from the cabinets below as they were ALWAYS empty, and had to constantly ask for coffee and hot water to be refilled which took them 20 minutes so we never bothered to wait. They provide coffee in the room however only provide ONE coffee pod of regular coffee a day (we have 2 people in our room) we asked twice for more coffee to be brought up to our room because the machines downstairs were always empty and we were on the 15th floor and the elevator takes 20 years to come, however the coffee pods never showed so we never had access to the complimentary coffee at all times that we were meant to have.

We stayed on Saturday night. Check in was fast and easy and greeted with a smile. Valet parking was $55 for the night but literally had 2 days of parking (that's important in NYC) the front desk even held our bags after checkout so we could eat lunch then return to pick up the car. Location of the hotel is great we were able to get to meatpacking district and midtown within minutes and being in the middle of the flower district was nice scenery as well. There is free starbucks coffee in the lobby ,free breakfast from 7am-10am (I love that this was a late breakfast I always wake up to late at other places that offered), and free bottled water if you ask the front desk. The rooms are clean and air condition is quiet and works well. Bathrooms are nice, good water pressure in the shower, hair dryer available and Paul Mitchell amenities. The staff at the front desk, housekeeping and maintenance are all so nice. We asked for late check out and they said yes without hesitation. Ok, now the shortcomings...but nothing that was not handled appropriately and with a smile. The toilet would not flush on 3 occasions and maintenance had to be called (not our fault...just flushing mechanism did not work). The second time called was in the morning and took over an hour to get someone to fix it. We did have a bit of a wait (30min+) when we called valet for the car but the front desk did notify us of the wait time prior. The room smelled musty when we first went in for about 15 minutes until the AC cleared itself (front desk offered to give us a new room without question but we declined as the smell went away). Breakfast does get crowded even though there is a good amount of seating- we ate in the lobby on the couches...perhaps they need more outdoor seating. The hair dryer might have been overheated as it got very very hot without a lot of air probably would have burned my hair so it was not used. In the end the front desk (each person from night shift to morning) was extremely kind and accomodating. They acknowledged the problems with the toilet and took care of us appropriately.

Great prices so I splurged for a City View (should be a great view of the Empire State Bldg) on a high floor. I am a Marriott Silver Rewards member which normally means something, but not to this hotel. Was placed on 8th floor (of something like 20 floors, so not so high). We arrived midafternoon, so we went up to our room to rest before going to an evening broadway show. After resting 10 minutes, the construction noise started, and simply did not stop. Looking outside, I could see the building that was being replaced, as they were scraping out the remaining foundation. We left for our dinner and show, and contemplated our choices. When we returned, it was pleasantly quiet. The next morning, the noise started at 7 AM. We couldn't sleep, so we went down for the free breakfast. The place was packed - the 2 empty tables were desperately in need of cleaning, and half the food items were out. The 1 lady working the area could hardly keep up with the demand. I had 2 hard boiled eggs with a yogurt, a far cry from the promised scrambled eggs, made to order waffles, fresh fruit, etc. So Not like the other Fairfields we've stayed at.It was Friday, so we were hoping no construction on Sat morning. We were wrong... I went down to talk to the manager, who hadn't shown up for his shift yet. The lady at the desk promised to move us to a much higher floor, facing the back (so no construction noise), and refund us the upgrade price. She said a room would be ready in a few hours, and they would move us. We arrived back at the appointed time to find a) she was gone b) there was a new room, 4 floors up but still facing construction c) they would not refund anything. No other options... so we took the higher floor and asked for earplugs.When booking Marriotts, I've ofter seen hotels note there is construction going on, so customers can make an informed choice. This was not the case.... would like to stay here again, but will call the hotel directly and ask!Not great customer service, and given the missing manager who only pays to have 1 overworked staffperson in the breakfast area, I am hoping someone else is in that role next time I plan my stay.","Hartford, Connecticut","MsCasualTravelor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hartford, Connecticut</strong>",82,2.0

The best parts I liked were that the rooms were reasonably spacious for a Manhattan hotel, the reception staff was quite warm (there was a relatively senior lady one of the mornings who was so quick to understand I was a tea drinker and quickly arranged for everything in the middle of the morning rush), the breakfast restaurant was well-equipped (even during the snowstorm), the bathrooms were perfectly clean and I got a fantastic view of The Empire State Building from my room (1402)! Also, there was possibly a Hispanic member of staff, a young lady, who had this very special attitude of coming into the breakfast area in the morning and greeting whoever made eye contact with a very vibrant, ""Good Morning"" - she was very helpful with many of the senior guests too. The range of teas was also impressive and I was also impressed by all the healthy items that were available for breakfast as walnuts, etc. Overall, things were clean, of good quality and reasonably warm (just that Countryside, boutique feel with the New Yorkish touch of speed and efficiency).Another big plus, given I am Indian, was that there were a whole bunch of Indian restaurants on Lexington Avenue, just a short walk from the hotel. Also, if you did not want to take a taxi, there were multiple train stations nearby. And Macy's and J C Penney and a whole host of branded shops were just a walk away.There were a few misses, of course, (you expect some over a 12 day period), like the TV remote was just missing (though I got to noticing that only after a few days) and though they knew early on that I was not a coffee person, they did not arrange a tea kettle as a replacement and only on one day of the 3-4 days I asked, the receptionist just did not get me tea in my room in the morning since I did not want to use the coffee machine to make tea since it could smell of coffee!. Another miss was that though I told the possibly Hispanic young lady about preparing all guests about the snowstorm since many of us were from outside New York or like me, not an American and though she said it was a good idea, she possibly could not convince the management to act on it and they did not send any information and we were left to figuring out ourselves. Luckily, I had a lot of friends whom I could call and figure out what to do. Like, since I am a vegetarian, I decided to stock up on a few essentials during the snowstorm and they promptly arranged a refrigerator (which honestly I expected in the room in a top hotel as this, and I am used to amazing hospitality in good hotels in India and I should have understood that this was the US and Manhattan at that and special things do not come without request or payment here - they did not charge me for that).Also, one of the days I needed a taxi quickly and the staff just asked me to walk to the corner and hail a Yellow Cab which actually took a full 15 minutes to get and I will have expected them to call for an Uber or figure out a faster mechanism to get me a cab - again, this one was not an easy one to fulfill and I wound not consider this one as a big miss.The internet was also patchy at times.Overall, if it were not for those misses, I will have given a 5-star rating here (I rarely give!) and nevertheless, if you are on a bleisure trip (business + leisure) trip or just a business trip, I will certainly recommend staying at this hotel - I have good memories of New York from here!","Navi Mumbai, India","anandb777</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Navi Mumbai, India</strong>",34,4.0

I wish they have something cute there. Maybe a fire pit or something similar so that you can sit and have a drink while looking at the Empire Building. It is near the Madison Square Garden and many places to eat. While there we visited Brother Jimmys bbq, and Friedmans restaurant which both were great.

The room was comfortable, clean and exceptionally quiet, and the hotel, itself, was spotless, secure, and inviting. I arrived before check-in time, and while they prepared my room, I was made comfortable in a relaxing room provided with a TV, long table, computers and beverages for guests. Check-in was a breeze, and the receptionist was very welcoming. Indeed EVERYONE from the front desk, to the custodian in the elevator to breakfast room attendant was polite and personable. But I should mention two people, in particular, who made the stay exceptional. The first is sales manager, Kathy Mendez, who personally welcomed me and arranged for me to use the ""Green Room"" part of the breakfast room for a film interview. The stress that normally attends such a project was enormously reduced by Ms Mendez whose lovely, gracious presence was professional, warm and reassuring. I felt quite at home and supremely at ease.The other notable is Jessica Jimenez whose genuine smile and natural charm at the front desk provide a wonderfully inviting beacon of assistance. She went out of her way to find me a choice of restaurants and was concerned as to my dining experience afterwards which precipitated a conversation that left me smiling and refreshed after a hectic day in the city. The included breakfast was the an unexpected treat and was one of the best I have encountered in the city. Moist scrambled eggs, fresh orange juice, oatmeal, quality brand yogurts, and many other choices were available for guests to partake of in the accommodating glassed-in breakfast room with its pleasing natural light. The location, a mere seven-minute walk from Penn Station, could not be more convenient, and an added bonus is that this section of West 28tn Street is the wholesale flower district of the city. So one's walk to the hotel is a pleasant mix of aromas and colors.But it all finally comes down to people, and what truly makes this Fairfield an oasis in the city is the staff who seem to function like a happy family. I seem to have found a new home in NYC. I'd like to keep the secret to myself, but that wouldn't be fair.(Side note: at the same time of my visit a friend of mine stayed at a Fairfield in Times Square and had a miserable time with an overworked and under-attentive staff in a hotel that needed cleaning and was noisy.

Upon checking in, there was a small hiccup with the rooms that were available but Teresa fixed it and we never saw the issue. Shortly after checking in we went to park our car and the lot attendant gave my husband a huge issue and almost got physical, we called Teresa not knowing what to do and she called the police and stayed on the line with us the entire time to make sure we were okay. The issue was resolved and as soon as we got back to the hotel all Teresa cared about is if we were okay, you could see in her face she was genuinely concerned. So that was our first night lol. The following night we saw her again and she wanted to hear about our day and was so sweet. We were sad to not see her the next morning for checkout but she really made our stay great! My husband is normally a tough critic when it comes to hotels mainly because he hates staying at them but this time I didn't hear one negative comment from him. Only reason I didn't give the 5 stars is because the room isn't exactly what was pictured, I'm mainly referring to the bathroom. But I will say it was clean, and spacious. We payed half the price of our friends that were staying closer to Times Square and we had a bigger room than them! Everything was within walking distance and I loved that it wasn't so loud at night. Walking out of the hotel to see beautiful flowers lined up on the sidewalk was awesome. We love Teresa!! And we will make sure uses there next time we go... With the kids! :) ",,cassie p,0,4.0

I had only visited NYC one other time and it was overwhelming. On my daughter's recommendation of the Chelsea area of the city I booked this hotel and found it to be perfect. There are two subway entrances close to the hotel- one right on the corner - the other a short walk that took me everywhere I wanted to go. The hotel sits on a street in the flower district so everyday you leave the hotel and get to see all the beautiful plants and flowers being set out, it was great. The hotel itself was clean and the room was really comfortable if not exactly spacious. The bathroom was fairly large considering the room itself had a king bed, desk with chair which doubled as your night stand on that side, a small night stand on the other side, and an armoire of sorts all of which took up just about all the available space. You also don't have to worry about walking far to your room since you exit the elevator, turn left or right and your room is pretty much right there. It was very quiet. I was on the 5th floor facing the building next to us (not pretty but blinds closed) and could not hear the city sounds, which is actually amazing and a welcome relief after being out all day.Probably shouldn't have left the staff until last but they certainly are the best. They remember you and welcome you back when you return from being out. They work hard to be accommodating. I asked one morning at breakfast if they had soy milk, the person attending the breakfast said no but they could have it in 2 minutes. I said no don't bother, it was no big deal I would eat something else. Next thing I know, here she comes with soy milk they had ran around the corner to buy just for me. Pretty sweet. It did turn out that she was the assistant manager so it might have been over and above what another staff person might have done but she did make me feel like she was glad I was staying there and she wanted my experience to be a good one.

Check in was fast and we were provided with maps and if we needed any recommendations we only had to ask. I travelled with my wife and 2 older children; we flew in and out from Newark. We used NJ Transit train which are every 20 minutes and took 30 minutes to NY Penn station. Come out of Penn station (Macys is across the road) turn right you’re on 7th Avenue keep walking until W28Street and turn left. We walked it with a suitcase and hand luggage easily in 15 minutes.

The bathroom was very clean and had a very powerful shower which was great; we were only given 2 towels on one occasion, not an issue as Wilson sorted us with additional towels. We were on 17 floor at the back of the hotel with a view of the 1 World Trade Centre. There are 2 lifts and they move quickly so there was never an issue getting to and from the room to the ground floor. There was free Wi-Fi for 3 devices in your room and the quality was excellent, probably the best Wi-Fi I have used in a hotel no buffering at all. The hotel as a rooftop area where you can sit, relax and enjoy the view of the Empire State Building.Breakfast was good, porridge, yoghurts, fresh waffles, bagels, bread, scrambled egg, bacon, sausage etc. The Starbucks was great and Tea Coffee and iced water was available in the breakfast area all day. If you ran out just ask and they bring f4resh. The ladies at breakfast were great always polite and they couldn’t do enough for you.My daughter was 21 while we were there. I emailed ahead and asked if we could dress up a table as a surprise for when she arrived at breakfast; they were delighted to be asked and they could help. One of the ‘breakfast’ ladies (I’m hopeless with names sorry but she had 2 young boys) helped set it up and Lina arranged a bottle of champagne for her. It was just perfect.We used the subway to get around. Turn left out of the hotel walk 200 metres and you reach line 1; 2 stops to Times Square and downtown to Battery Park, 9/11 Memorial. Turn right cross 8th Avenue walk 200 metres and you have Line N & R down to Brooklyn and Lexington Ave area.We hope we will visit New York again and if I did I would not hesitate to use this hotel again.

Decent, fast (and free) wifi for the duration of the stay was welcome too. Be aware - it's in the heart of the flower district, which means that the flower wholesalers on the street below start work at about 5am. The rooms are well soundproofed, so unlikely to disturb all but the lightest sleepers. For us, it was a bonus - we loved getting up early and watching all the goings-on below us.Bed was huge and comfortable. Bathroom was snug but had a good sized shower.There's a small gym in the basement (which we didn't use, but looked fine), plus a vending machine and ice machine.There's no opportunity for evening meals, but you can bring back food and use the dining room.

As requested, he assigned us a room on a high floor with a very nice view of the Empire State Building. The room, albeit it small, was well appointed and well-equipped. The room included the following: a very comfortable king bed, nice bed linens, a large flat screen TV, a desk/chair, iron/board, clock radio, adequate storage drawers/closet, nice toiletries and an adequate number of towels.The breakfast was very good and had a nice variety of foods, including continental type foods and cooked breakfast foods. The staff in the breakfast area were always helpful and accommodating.The hotel had a roof-top balcony with tables and seating which was open 24 hours and had very nice views of the surrounding city area. The hotel also had a small exercise room in the basement and somewhat unusual for NYC, the hotel had an ice machine and soft drink machine in the basement.The location of the hotel is great for travelling to the US Open. Penn Station is only a few short blocks away and the Long Island Railroad runs regularly to the National Tennis Center. The LIRR costs a few dollars more than the 7 train to the National Tennis Center but the additional cost is well worth it. The train in very clean, very cool and the seats are very comfortable. It is also usually less crowded and runs 24/7.The hotel is also well positioned for touring and sightseeing. A subway stop is about a block away which allows you to get most anywhere in NYC. The hotel is in the flower district so it’s very nice to walk through the fragrant flowers and plants when entering and exiting the hotel. Hell’s Kitchen is also close by with a number of good inexpensive restaurants in the area. Times Square is about a 15/20 minute “easy” walk from the hotel (highly recommend Matilda, if you want to see a very unique Broadway musical). The staff at the Fairfield are all very personable, helpful and accommodating. The cookies at night are a nice touch.

We booked our trip to New York as a belated honeymoon, celebrated our 1 year wedding anniversary as well as my 30th birthday. As we are in our first year of marriage we wanted something that was not going to break the bank, but something that would do justice to the multiple celebrations. The Fairfield Inn met and exceeded our expectations. About a week before the trip my husband called and spoke with Leo letting him know the purpose of our trip. Leo went above and beyond making our stay special. He was able to offer us an upgraded room and greeted us with a warm welcoming smile when we checked in. As we arrived several hours early, the staff offered to hold our luggage for us (for free) so we could go explore the city while we waited. Once we came back and checked into our room we were incredibly pleased by everything. The room was very comfortable and the view of the Empire State Building was unexpected and very nice! A factor for our decision to book with Fairfield Inn was the included breakfast. We were not expecting anything spectacular and would have been perfectly fine with cereal and bagels. The breakfast did include cereal and bagels, but also muffins, toast, hot eggs, fruit, a breakfast meat (sausage or bacon), waffles, yogurt, coffee, tea and much more. We ate breakfast downstairs almost every morning and enjoyed the variety. The staff were always very friendly and accommodating to us. We were meet with a smile and polite greeting every morning when we headed out, and friendly conversation upon return regarding our day. Everyone that we interacted with seemed to meet us where we were at. If we wanted to chat a bit, they kindly obliged and engaged in pleasant conversation. If we were worn out and just looking to get to our room, they did not intrude.The day we were to check out was very rainy. Since check out was at noon, but our flight did not leave until 7pm, Leo was able to allow us to check out late so we did not have to arrive at the airport 7 hours early. The absolute cherry on top of this fantastic stay was the little surprise we got one even upon returning to our room. The staff had decorated our room with rose petals, fruit, cupcakes, a bottle of wine and a card wishing us a happy anniversary. We were so blown away by the attention to detail and the customer service we experienced during our stay.

We were attending a concert there Friday and arrived early. We were told that early check in was to be determined upon availability on arrival. We were pleasantly surprised to find an available room on the 12th floor with a perfect view of the Empire State Building! The front desk clerk, Bethany, was a HUGE help and a doll to work with. Another surprise was the rooftop terrace! We enjoyed many cocktails up there while enjoying the unobstructed view of the Empire State Building! BYOB :) The rooms were clean and the bed was VERY comfortable, especially after a day of walking around the city. However, the bathroom was a tad small. You're in NYC though, so it's to be expected. I woke up the next morning early and came downstairs to find a nice continental breakfast spread. They had eggs, sausage, hash browns, baked goods, juice, and STARBUCKS COFFEE!! We enjoyed a great day walking around the city on Saturday and found a great Sushi place for dinner, located within the Bryant Park Hotel, Koi. It was delicious and Ya Ya the hostess went out of her way to seat us at the perfect table! On the morning of our departure, we called down to front desk to ask for the valet to bring our car and were told there was a two hour wait. We were not in any rush to get home. So, this didn't upset us, but if you need to get out at a specific time. PLAN ACCORDINGLY!!! It seemed as though there was only one man working the valet service, and on a Sunday morning at check out time, it's VERY BUSY! So, we went to plan B. Bethany, at the front desk couldn't have been more helpful and understanding. There is a $1500 charge for checkout time past 11:00 and she waved that for us, as well as gave us some good ideas on what to do with our ""free time."" We ended up taking a left out of the hotel doors and ran into the Highline walking trail. I highly recommend it! We had an amazing view of the Hudson River and lots of surprises along the way! Eventually we ended up at the Chelsea Market and were again pleasantly surprised!!! We made it back by 11:30 to find our car waiting outside the hotel for us.

The room was what we were expecting size wise. Big enough for two people but not a large suite. The bathroom was quite small and lacked bench space to put anything. The water from the cold tap in the bathroom in warm/hot so not very nice to drink from.The breakfast was basic; cereal, toast, bagels, yoghurt, fruit salad if you were lucky, and two hot options; either sausage patties, dry overcooked bacon, fried potatoes or scrambled egg patties which weren't appealing. There was also free starbucks coffee you could help yourself to anytime of the day.The let down was that there was hardly ever water available to drink at breakfast, I think I counted twice there was a glass water dispenser by the coffee you could help yourself to, otherwise you only had juice, coffee or tea to drink. A hot chocolate option would be a nice addition too. Also, the cereals weren't refilled during the breakfast sittings and most if not all options were high in sugar children style options.The fruit salad was also not refilled so if you weren't down there early you were tough out of luck.Our last morning there was a Sunday and the hotel clearly had a lot of guests. We had to go away then come back for breakfast as the first time there was no where to sit. Upon our return we noticed that even though there was clearly people still coming down close to 10:30 am (which is the finishing time for breakfast), possibly due to having to go away and come back again like us, the staff packed up breakfast bang on time. The breakfast maid was literally taking the bread away while people were still queuing for the toaster machine and locking up all the plates and cutlery etc. It actually felt quite mean and snarky and I witnessed a lot of disgruntled guests who missed out. We understand things have to run on schedule, but the dining area is too small for a large number of guests to use at one time and so maybe the hotel should either extend the weekend dining times or be a little bit lenient so nobody misses out.The best part of the hotel was their front of house employee Daniel, who always greeted us when we entered, was extremely welcoming and helpful with any questions or issues and farewelled us like we were friends.Overall a good stay and we would recommend this hotel to others and would probably stay at it again if we ever returned to New York.","Auckland, New Zealand","Sketi88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",3,4.0

The staff was very nice, friendly and helpful. The street is also interesting in that apparently this very block of Manhattan is some kind of ""floral district"" so regardless of the warm weather ""aroma"" NYC tends to give you this time of year... each early morning, the vendors start to set out their flowers, trees, shrubs and plants for distribution/sale. The bonus that this street smells wonderful! Then each evening, they move them back indoors and it's like it never happened. But all and all, to an out of towner, it seemed like a pretty average big city street with a couple of indirect added bonuses. There are a couple of average-good restaurants nearby and a Duane Reade market on nearly every corner.Again, upon arrival the front desk staff was very kind and immediately offered a dinner destination (which was just ok). Be forewarned, most things about this hotel are quite small, including the lobby. By far the smallest lobby I've experienced. They they did somehow manage a nice little patio area out front to safely watch NY life go by.The rooms are also fairly, if not quite, small. I did have a King bed with 2 nightstands, a desk, a TV stand/dresser, small closet and small bathroom. All of which were very clean, including the shower (usual giveaway on cleanliness). The room was semi-modern and had a reasonable amount of outlets for charging all of todays devices, but I would have preferred a couple more on the night stands (1 per nightstand) and possibly some USB chargers around the room as most new hotels do. The bathroom was tiny (door has to be opened and closed to get around it to use the vanity), but usable. Again, shower/tub with cloth curtain was clean and water pressure was decent. Vanity was small but perfectly functional. Vanity mirror had an ambient light that is a nice feature. Bathroom did have a overhead light out that made it a bit dark though. All and all, better than average all around the restroom though.Upon arrival for some reason the TV was unplugged and the remote seemed to not want to respond to it very well. But ultimately it satisfied. Street view was interesting (from 9th floor) and I was able to see the Empire State Building from the room/bed - that was kind of cool. Otherwise, interesting views of other building rooftops and city life.I opted to take the hotel up on their black car back to the airport on my final morning at their recommendation - they said it would ultimately be cheaper than a cab or Uber - but with tip (20%) it ended up just under $80. I think I could have gotten a cab or Uber cheaper, but it was morning rush hour so who knows.I think I'll try a couple of the other newer hotels on 28th street on my upcoming trips back to this area, but if I had to stay at this hotel again, it would not concern me.Oh, one last thing... as usual with most hotels today... the wifi was atrociously slow. photo attached of the internet speed test.

The area is great too, lots of good restaurants in walking distance. Also, it's in the middle of the flower district, so every day you exit the hotel to a jungle of beautiful plants & amazing smelling flowers. It was a real treat every morning!The staff was really nice, very warm greeting at the front desk and always very helpful and informative. I must make a special note for Leo & Kevin, they were both superb and sincerely friendly. Great guys!

Obviously, it's a Fairfield Inn and not a high-end Marriott, but the location in the northern part of Chelsea met my needs: a long walk to NYU (or take the nearby N train) but close proximity to the Empire State Bldg., Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, and the ultimate Macy's -- all lots of fun to walk to at night (not a great nearby restaurant scene, however). Best was the dollar value: on a Sunday night, I spent less than $100, including taxes, which is an extraordinary bargain in NYC. Also important was the staff and basic amenities: terrific, super-friendly young woman at the desk, a free modest breakfast where everything was done right and seating was comfortable, a discount on nearby overnight parking ($35 a good price in NYC!), and good wi-fi, tv, excellent bed, and endless hot water in the shower. So, while the room was much smaller than I'm accustomed to in a Fairfield Inn or other Marriott, the overall value was worth the compromise.

From that perspective, the Fairfield Inn is outstanding. Sure, the rooms are small, but this is Manhattan! And anywhere else but NYC, you'd probably expect more for $300+ a night. However, the hotel is new, modern and very well-maintained. Our room was cleaned each morning while we were having breakfast downstairs. That's pretty unique. Again, as a former Manhattanite, I can attest to how quiet the rooms are, if you forgo the view (not much to speak of unless you're on a high floor) and take a room at the back of the hotel. You'll face other buildings and there is no natural light, but you won't have street noise. From the moment we arrived, the front desk folks were helpful and professional. They worked to find us a room to our liking. They greeted us every time we came and went. And they always asked if they could do anything for us. Even the staff in the breakfast room were helpful. One morning I wasn't feeling well and the staff helped my husband select and package some food to bring to the room. They are also very vigilant in terms of keeping all of the breakfast items restocked.The location is superb. You can walk to Times Square, Chelsea, the West Village, and you are in the middle of NoMad, a new hotel and restaurant district. There is a subway on either side of the hotel--one line on 6th Ave and another on 7th. And the Broadway and Lexington Ave lines are only a few blocks away. This is not a luxury hotel so don't expect plush towels and high-end toiletries.

It is close to the subway station, maybe a 5 minute walk, that made it nice to get where we wanted quickly. Lots of little places to eat all around. The hotel did offer fresh cookies each night. The rooms were clean, but TINY, I was hoping for a great view of empire state building, but instead we got a level 4 room that faced another building and every evening we had to close the blinds because it was a yoga studio we could see them, and they could see us. This hotel does have a roof top you can go & see great views of empire state building. I did have a couple complaints, the first day at check in we get to the room, it had only one bath towel & 2 hand towels, I called down and asked for another towel , one for each of us & wash cloths, with in a few minutes they did bring us another towel and hand towel- not wash cloth but it was late, so we made do. The following day of our stay we came back to the hotel & our room had not been cleaned, we got in and there was a do not disturb tag on our door, I understand why it was not cleaned but I didn't place it there, not sure if it was in the hall on floor or what - but again I called front desk, and at least asked for fresh towels, 30 minutes later we still did not have the towels, I called again, they came within a few minutes. They offered breakfast, all the normal things, starbucks coffee, tea, hot chocolate, eggs, sausage, oatmeal, cereal, bagels, toast & muffins, yogart, boiled eggs. The breakfast area got really busy in the mornings and one morning there was no seating, When we ate at 8 am or earlier it was busy but still seating, the last day it was almost 9, a lot of food was gone, but they were working on getting it replaced, but so many people would line up & take everything just placed out- I definitely recommend going earlier for better selection & enjoyment! They held our luggage while we toured city on last day since check out was a t noon and our flight was at 8:30 p,m, Overall we enjoyed our stay. My biggest complaint was I didn't realize when booking through hotel.com we would not accrue our Marriott reward points, once I booked my delta tickets I was transferred over & booked directly through them, This was upsetting because of our week long stay I missed out on over 12,000 points, had I known this locations rules on that I would have called them directly.

We did choose to take the subway to 911 memorial and sometimes to times square, if we were tired of walking. The Red line is just 1/2 block away, which made it very convenient.The hotel is clean, and updated and if you just have 2 people in a room it would be fine.They need to improve the lighting in the room and we also were never given the right amount of towels.",PA,"rwjab</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>PA</strong>",20,3.0

Great accommodations and lodging experience in the true center of Manhattan. Great location and central to all our favorite haunts. Situated between two major subway lines traveling the spine of Manhattan -- one block or less from the 1-2-3 lines on the west and the N-Q-R lines on the east -- 10 minutes or less via subway to Midtown and Times Square uptown and SoHo/Canal Street/Lower Manhattan downtown. Situated in the middle of the block on a street full of florists and flower supply shops -- this portion of W. 28th Street should be named ""Flower Street"". The rooms are surprisingly modern and spacious for NYC, and had all the amenities we needed. Roomy desk and closets, large flat-screen TV, spacious bathroom and sink area. A bit tight on deep enough space to lay out two open suitcases, though. Room thermostat and ventilation was more than adequate. Free wireless internet service in our room and public areas was also satisfactory and easy to use. Great view of the Empire State Building from our room, especially at night -- it looked so close I had to ask the front desk clerk for confirmation just to make sure -- making it slightly reminiscent of scenes from ""Sleepless in Seattle"". Complimentary breakfast in the morning was organized and very satisfactory. Eggs and breakfast sausage, along with breads, rolls, cereals, juice and coffee was standard fare. Surprisingly situated greenhouse dining area in the rear of the property made breakfast a very pleasant experience. If that wasn't enough, there are Starbucks and McDonalds right down the block in either direction. This neighborhood is a shopper's paradise. Macy's flagship store is less than 6 blocks walk uptown on 34th St and Broadway or you can take a train. On Saturday, there is a long 9-block outdoor marketplace and farmer's market all along Broadway from 23rd St. to 14 St. (the street is closed to traffic). Continue down Broadway to Canal St. to explore this great SoHo shopping district. Also close by to the hotel are Madison Square Garden and Penn Station just a few blocks walk from the hotel to the west. The hotel staff and daytime manager were extremely courteous and helpful during the extent of our weekend stay, beginning with the complimentary chocolate chip cookies when check in. The service (including Housekeeping) was excellent -- they accommodated our every request. On the last day (check-out), they offered complimentary bag service in their locked storage area until our scheduled airport shuttle arrived. All in all, we had nothing but extremely positive experiences at this hotel. We would stay here again in a heartbeat, and definitely plan to.

They were very friendly and very attentive to my needs. They made sure I was comfortable in my room and helped me greatly when I needed to adjust my reservation. The valet service leaves a lot to be desired, not because of the facility but because of the service providers themselves, they were not very good at bringing around the vehicles in the time they should. Twice I had to wait more than an hour to obtain my vehicle from them. I felt as if the room was bigger than I would have thought and I think it's because there is not a wall between the hallway from the door to the bed and the bathroom as there are with quite a few hotels in Manhattan. The room was very comfortable. I believe if you have a room to the northeast you will have of the city and the Empire State Building but you can ask the front desk as they were very kind to offer a room with a view, it will cost a bit more naturally but the view is really nice from a high floor.

Previous visits have always been excellent. This one was seriously marred by our first use of the valet parking. I called down to the desk at about 10:30am for our car to be brought round. We went downstairs shortly thereafter. There was a lot of construction on the street, so we asked the desk for guidance on where we would be met. Mr. Lopez(?) wasn't very helpful, but we figured on a one way street we'd work it out. And so we waited. After half an hour we checked with the desk and were told ""your car is on the way"" by Mr. Lopez. Another half an hour later we checked again (remember, we are standing on the street all this time with suit bags, suitcases and laptop bags since the front was blocked with construction vehicles). This time Mr' Lopez called the lot to check, ""Car is on the way"". Another half an hour passed. Finally. nearly 2 hours after we'd called for our car, it pulled up on the street and we had to get into it right on the street (no parking left after this two hour wait). We asked the valet where the lot was... on 25th Street... THREE BLOCKS AWAY. We could have walked that distance in 5 minutes. Though it really wasn't the valet's fault, we were quite frustrated, so no tip. The desk clerk (Lopez) was less than helpful, and certainly not apologetic for our interminable wait. After many great stays at this hotel, we are seriously considering never staying there again. We at least have learned the lesson to never, ever use the valet parking service there again. We'll handle it ourselves, much more efficiently. Was the valet lot called in the first place?

Not scary, but always be careful into the late night in the city. One thing to be cautious about is airport access. It's completely doable, but be sure to give yourself ample time. We flew in from Newark and took the air-train to Penn Station for $12.50 and walked the 4 blocks to the hotel, which worked great, but on the way back we didn't want to chance having to wait for a train back to the airport so we got a car service for around $100.

For Parking (if needed), go the the one situated on 28th street just below 6th avenue (south side) and make sure to get the coupon stamped by the hotel for a 30$ a day fee.

Sometimes the coffee (starbucks btw) was good and other times it tasted burnt or old. Not sure why.

Every employee (too many to mention each by name), from those we spoke with by phone prior to our visit to those with whom we interracted during our stay, were both professional and personable. They made us feel right at home. Special recognition should go to Katie C who upon learning that we were there to celebrate our daughter's birthday went above and beyond with an upgraded room (great view of ESB) and a bday surprise. The rooms are large by NYC standards, well appointed and very clean. The free wifi and beakfast add to the already outstanding value.

The iron was dirty from another guest's misuse, and the ironing board cover had holes in the foam and wouldn't stay in place. I requested another board and iron from two -- yes, two -- people at the front desk, but never got it.Another problem with the room was something that's all too common. Style and function are a balancing act, and when it comes to bathroom renovations, far too many hotels come down way too far on the side of style. Hip tile and fixtures are great, and I do appreciate them, but not at the expense of functionality.It get it -- NY bathrooms are notoriously small, and there's not much room for counter space. But that's all the more reason to have a shelf or two. It's a hotel. Guests have toiletries. They have to go somewhere.The bathroom lighting, while not the worst I've ever experienced, was also lacking.

The room was also quiet, all points I value but it ended there.The room is however tiny small (much smaller than competing hotels across the street or one or two blocks away where I have stayed in the past). The heat control in the room is poor and the desk is a tiny table wedged in a corner. Every time I tried to get out of the desk chair (it is the only chair in the room) it was banging into the heater or the bed because the room is so SMALL and the desk is stuck in the corner. The heat seemed to have one setting on or off. I would get cold so I pushed the thermostat up one degree and then the room would get boiling hot so then I pushed it down a degree and it would go off and never come back on (or worse yet one time the a/c kicked on) till the point the room was so cold you had to go push it back up a degree.Also the room has no draws or anyplace to put clothes or anything down. To work I had to spread out things on the bed. There are tiny (useless) shelves in a corner and a small cupboard with hangers. I ended up using the stone windowsill which meant everything got freezing cold. Only other place would be to pile things on the floor and climb over them because there is no chair or bureau or .... Same in the bathroom no counter top or shelf or place to put anything other on the very small edge of the sink.They say they have a ""full service business center"" but that turns out to be two computers in the corner of the breakfast room. I had a word processing file to print out but there are no programs on the computers. I asked at the front desk and the staff said they would look into it. I asked later in the day and they attitude was ""oh well"" and the staff suggested you can go down the street to Staples. (As I pointed out later to the manager if I go down the street I can go the Indigo Hotel or the Hilton or the Holiday Inn or the Doubletree or .... all within a stone throws and better equipped for travelers.) I said that is not a business center and the response from the front desk: complain to management. I said you are management as far as a guest is concerned and they laughed. I did later complain to management that the computers had no programs like Word and the response was we can not do that because of licenses. I have stayed in a LOT of hotels (business oriented and otherwise) and this is the only one which does not have its computers set up with a basic programs. The manager says you can down load a viewer program if you want.... really if you say you have a ""full service business center"" and want to have business travelers you need to be better set up and not expect us to be searching out and downloading programs or going down the street for a BASIC service. Personally as I said I would suggest one of the other hotels all within a block or two (some across the same street) any of which I have had better experiences with than this one when I stayed at those other hotels.For a hotel in the Marriott band I expected better service and better facilities.

Parking is about a half block away, very convenient and very cheap for NY.Beds were not the most comfortable. Room was small, but hey, its NY.

Spent Thu/Fri/Sat there the week before Christmas. The value was excellent for the amenities. I would highly recommend this for anyone spending a weekend in the city.Room - The room was new, clean and inviting. It was a little small, but right in line with what I would expect in NYC. After all, we have stayed at the Waldorf Astoria and for much more money had no more room.Bath - Small. A very nice bathroom, but very small. Two people cannot get ready at the same time. Once again, we experienced the same size issues at the Waldorf.Breakfast - Perfectly Adequate. I stay in hotels quite a bit on business. Some offer cook to order breakfasts, others have prepackaged pastries. Like all Fairfields, this is in the middle. Eggs and sausage taste fine, but are obviously mass produced. Cereal, bread, yogurt, and other options are also available. While not fancy, the breakfast is sufficient and right in line with what others offer at this price point.Location - Convenient. By subway we found it was (including walking to/from stations):- 20 minutes from the 9/11 Memorial- 10 minutes from Times Square- 12 minutes from Rockefeller Center- 30 minutes from Central ParkComplaint - Internet. It continues to baffle me that hotels offer such S--L--O--W internet service and think it is sufficient. If going back to NYC for business, I would have to rule out the Fairfield.

They're too cheap to provide proper heat! Room was freezing, I turned on the heat and it never adequately kicked in. I raised it to 77 just to get some heat pumping, but it never rose above 65, and I'm being generous on that. I asked for help, the maintenance guy came in and told me that it was 77 in there because the thermostat said so. I complained an hr later, and the front desk told me that they cap the heat to save energy costs. Nice in the fall, bad when it's 20 degrees outside with snow on the ground. The ""tip"" was to set it to 74, so that the room would at least heat up to that temp. But it never even got there.Worse, my room didn't even have an extra blanket. As is, the comforter on the bed was way too thin for a winter day, even with heat. There's no way I could have spent the night there without the extra blanket. So for $250, I had the privilege to sleep in thermals. Beyond that, the free WiFi was horribly slow and unusable. Even the wired Internet connection cut in and out constantly. Horrible for a business traveler. Second, someone on my floor was smoking weed at 4pm on a Monday. When I asked to change rooms to a non-smoking floor, they informed me that the whole building was non-smoking. I don't think they ever caught the guy because my room smelled again when I returned to the room later that night. So that's unlucky on my part, but still made a bad experience even worse.So no, never staying here again.

Coffee drinkers either love or hate Starbucks. We aren't all that fond of it.- The hotel footprint is a rather small square. This makes the reception area and breakfast area kind if tight and congested. Also, saw prior comments about one guest being close to the elevators.

Trying to match price and quality is often a challenge and we believe this hotel is a solid choice. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The room is totally functional though a little tight on space, especially the bathroom. We thought with the KIng City View room we booked and that we had booked the room for a week we would have been a bit higher in the building; as it turned out we had an okay view of the Empire State building from the 8th flr and a much better view of the condo's across the street. Breakfast each morning was the same but provided everything you needed. The serving area is quite cramped and a few things could be moved around to make access a little easier but that is a minor complaint. We felt sorry for the lone staff member who tried to keep all the stations full and clean up at the same time.The hotel is located near 2 different subway stations and near bus stops heading both downtown and uptown. Times Square is walk-able (we enjoy walking) at about 20 minutes and even easier with the subway. Being in the Flower District was interesting watching all the stores move all those plants in and out each day.The building had a little more noise from the street than we would have liked. The air conditioner was a little loud when it was turning on but really no worse than many other hotels/motels we have stayed at that have individual units in the rooms. WIth that said increasing the white noise in the room and my wife (who is a light sleeper) wearing earplugs we got the sleep we needed.There is a Penthouse level that allows you a commanding view of the New York skyline, the only thing that was disappointing was the fans(?) or what ever they were that were roaring on the roof. Didn't make for a very enjoyable atmosphere on the roof top.As an aside and nothing to do with the hotel, New York can be very expensive or it can be reasonable. Do your due diligence if money is a concern it can be the difference between between a $5-$8 glass of wine verses places that there are no selections under $15 a glass. We were able to find many great restaurants and bars that were fun, had great food and atmosphere. Though we also went to a few ""nice"" spots as well, I mean we were in New York after all. :)Based on what we were told about New York hotels and prices this hotel was a good choice for us.",Edmonton,"LSUC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton</strong>",84,5.0

Instead we were on the bottom 8 with a view directly into the building across the street. We could live without a city view - it was the noise that was unbearable. The air con unit's compresser kicks in and out several times an hour and the unit also rattles - it sounds like a plane taking off next to the bed. This, combined with the traffic noise and noise from next door, made for a truly terrible sleep even with earplugs. We've stayed in several Manhattan hotels and dozens of hotels in busy cities like Tokyo and London, and Fairfield is the noisiest. The staff were all friendly and helpful but the quality of the building is not in their control. I was surprised that the room was dusty, there were small hairs in the shower and on the toilet and the bed sheets were not big enough to cover the unwashed comforter (duvet) - not something you want to wake up covered by.

It was good for us with our two days in the city, but I can't imagine where a group of, say, four people there for a week would put their luggage. We were in the back of the building, so our window was literally looking into another building, which was a little strange (caused us to keep the blinds closed). The rooftop deck was awesome!

Like the other reviewers say, the rooms are very small but it was not a problem since we basically were only there to sleep and were busy all day exploring everything NYC has to offer. We found the room to be very clean which was one of our main worries. Free Wi-Fi service is available throughout the hotel however the speed of the connection is very slow and which makes it only suitable for very light web browsing. The flat screen TV had a nice choice of channels including some premium ones such as HBO.One of the main problems we had with the room is the lack of available power outlets near the beds. Nowadays we all travel with numerous electronic devices (iPhones, iPads, cameras, computers) that requires charging at night and with three persons in the room it was a little puzzle to get everyone's devices plugged in at night. The hotel provides free breakfast every day which includes scrambled eggs, sausage patties, toast, bagels, cereal and fruit cocktail but to my surprise no waffles. I think I have never been to a US hotel that offers free continental breakfast and didn't have a self-serve waffle maker available in the breakfast area. That was a little disappointment for me because I really like hotel waffles but even without those the breakfast was really good.Located on W 28th Street the hotel is within walking distance from Penn Station which is very useful for those arriving from JFK airport via Long Island Rail Road train. Macy's flagship store and Herald Square are also located close to the hotel as well as a good number of great restaurants. There is also a McDonald's, a Starbucks and a Duane Reade drugstore located within less than 5 minutes walking distance. Times Square is within 20-25 minutes walking distance from the hotel, even tough it is a feasable walk we prefered taking a cab most of the time to go there which is about a 6-7$ ride plus tip.Overall, we are very satisfied with our stay at this Fairfield Inn location. Being one of the least expensive accomodations we found on Manhattan island we were very impressed with the quality of the service we received from the front desk and housekeeping staff and would not hesitate to stay at this property again on a next visit to NYC.","Longueuil, Canada","MrJmbjmb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Longueuil, Canada</strong>",8,4.0

The hotel is quite small: 18 floors with around 5-6 rooms per floor.Rooms were very clean, and my room was quite specious (for a NYC room).The hotel location is great, with subway stops less than a block a way (red lines and yellow lines).I've slept on the 17th floor which was quiet 99% of the time (you can easily hear people waiting for the elevator, and the elevator ping, but not across rooms). The complimentary breakfast is a great start in the morning. It has everything you need, including fresh cut fruits and pastries.The stuff was friendly and helpful throughout my stay (though I didn't have any real issue).Few general comments:-My room was equipped with a 37'' TV with around 30 channels. -I've spent 10 days at the hotel, and my sheets were only replaced after I specifically asked for it (they basically don't replace sheets throughout your stay unless you ask). When asked, they were replaced that day.-There is no refrigerator in the room. There is a single ice machine in the lower Lobby floor- The AC system is EXTREMELY loud and weird. When clicking on off, it takes around 10 minutes for the system to actually stop working. Any change of temperature, also requires a long wait before it actually happens. However, the room was always cool enough for my needs.- The mattress is very soft- Free Wifi across the hotel and rooms Bottom line - a very positive stay and a hotel I will surely get back to.","Tel Aviv, Israel","eronen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel</strong>",29,4.0

The parking is very close, just after crossing Sixth Ave and was just $25 with hotel validation.Check in was easy and Bethany who hails from Texas and later Brandi were super friendly and helpful. They allowed us to check in about an hour early at 2pm. Our room on the 8th floor was clean and certainly large enough for the two of us. However it's possibly a little too small to practice the hammer throw or discus!Air conditioning worked a treat and I must single out the bed as perhaps one of the most comfortable we've experienced so far. I hope Fairfield management can point us toward purchasing a similar mattress! We also loved the bathroom and large walk in shower.Public areas were spotless, the rooftop ""penthouse"" (observatory) was a nice distraction and the breakfast area was spotless, cheerful and well stocked - not bad for a free breakfast. I also loved the small number of rooms per floor, resulting in lots of peace and quiet and the elevator responded quickly on all but one occasion. I could say that a small fridge would have been nice, but it's really difficult and probably a little bit unfair to even consider leveling criticism at this superbly run hotel. We loved the area too and short walks south on Sixth, Seventh and eight Avenues led to a wide array of excellent eateries with the West Village within walkable distance too. I'm glad too that the hotel is south of the touristy mayhem that seems to start at around 33rd Street and move north. It's a reflection of the location of this hotel that we never used the subway or a taxi during our two day stay. We walked everywhere.

As previous reviewers have noted, the location is great, but what really makes this hotel a standout is the staff. We encountered staff members while checking in, when we came in in the middle of night from sightseeing, and then again at checkout and each time, every person that we encountered was not just courteous in a detached professional way - each person was genuinely friendly, funny, and interested in making our stay pleasant. The front desk staff were helpful in safely storing our baggage after checkout so we could continue sightseeing and responsive to needs like calling cabs, setting wake-up calls, getting the internet password, etc. In one instance, a front desk clerk who helped check us in was still at the desk when we returned from sightseeing around midnight and she revealed that another staff member had called in sick so that she would have to stay until about 7 the next morning. Even though she had every right to be tired and surly under those conditions she was funny and charming. In speaking with the staff, they not only seemed to care about the guests of the hotel, they seemed to care about each other, which evidently makes it a pleasant working environment that they freely share with the guests. Coming from the south, I had braced myself for the unfriendliness that is rumored to exist in New York, but we felt as welcome in the City as we have anywhere else in the world - everyone we met, including the staff of this hotel, was fun and friendly. We had an amazing time. I don't know who does the hiring for this hotel, but whatever they are doing - they are doing it right. As an aside, there is a not-very-good movie called ""Premium Rush"" about bicycle messengers that I recently saw and some of the action in this movie takes place right at the doorstep of this hotel. So that's kind of cool. The rooms are pretty small, but the bathrooms are spacious. Everything was very clean.

This was a mother-daughter get-a-way planned since Jan. We took a shuttle from Newark Airport, and on arrival were greeted by friendly staff. We stayed in room 207 which does not have a good view, but was nice and quiet, so we didn't mind, and like other people have mentioned, we didn't spend much time in our room anyway. We did go up to the terrace which was fun. The beds were super comfortable. Room was clean. It was great having the breakfast included. We always found lots to eat. Starbucks coffee was great. We did find our air conditioning very cold. It seemed like the temperature couldn't be adjusted, so that in a matter of a few minutes, it went from being warm in the room to freezing! Especially with the room being small. We tried leaving just the fan on, but it didn't make a big difference. It was so nice to see all the flowers on the sidewalk as we stepped out in the morning. Overall, we had a great experience there, and I would have returned except for one thing that happened. My daughter left behind a shopping bag in the wardrobe in our room (never mentioned to me that she had put it in there out of the way). She had gone to one of her favourite stores and bought 2 blouses and had also picked up a souvenir t-shirt and put it in the bag. We did not put anything else in the wardrobe. On arriving home, approx. 12 hrs. later, she realized that she had forgot it. She phoned the hotel the next morning and explained to the staff, described the bag, where she had left it, what was in it, etc. She indicated that she has a friend who lives nearby and could go and pick up the articles left behind. This friend is actually coming to our city next month. After a couple of phone calls, she was told that the bag wasn't found. That's it. No other explanation. She phoned back and left a message with the manager of the hotel, but he did not return her call, and it's been well over a week. There is no doubt in her mind where she left the bag. There must be a policy in place at the hotel for articles left behind, but since my daughter did not hear back, we don't know what that policy is.

The room was tiny for two adults and had a very narrow bathroom (no counter space, and you could barely close the door once you entered). I would steer guests away from this room, as you can hear every conversation in the hallway, every guest urinating in adjacent rooms, and the elevator dinged seeminly non-stop. There is also a loud, buzzing bathroom light. Although there was music and loud drumming echoing from the alley outside from a nearby nightclub, it did stop before midnight.

Prices ranged from $109.00 for a room with a bed and common bathroom to $1000.00 for rooms that looked like standard hotel rooms. I decided to go with The Fairfield Inn because it seemed like what I had in mind and offered some things that all hotels should include free of charge, those being a continental breakfast and Wifi. Sorry but free wifi is more important than having a phone or Bible.Nowhere did I see that Wifi was available in all rooms so I took that chance. Wifi is available in all rooms. I told them upon checking out that they need to make sure everyone knows that they offer this and it's a pretty big deal.What was a bigger deal was how nice everyone was at the hotel. I had perhaps the best experience I've ever had in the city and a lot of it was due to The Fairfield Inn. I was taking a class at the Parsons School and had to print out papers for a test, no problem, printing free of charge, as many sheets as necessary. Candy at the counter, cookies on Sunday, everyone extremely happy to help out with great personality as well, it was just a great experience. The room was $249.00 a night. There were additional taxes and fees upon leaving but I knew that would happen and I think that is the case at any hotel in the city. Those totaled about $40.00 per night and seemed if anything, slightly lower than other hotels I was pricing. I was pleasantly suprised to see the breakfast choices available, also included in the price. Bagels, scrambled eggs, sausage, starbucks coffee, yogurt, more than enough choices.The room was a little dusty in the corners but this could be just me. I'm a little wary of bedbugs so I gave the place a good going over and saw nooks and crannies that hadn't seen the light of day for awhile.

It was even better than what I expected. We arrived on Thursday morning (we took the red eye from California) at Newark and took the AirTrain to NJ Transit to Penn Station. Super easy! Then we walked 5 blocks to the hotel and even though our room wasn't ready, they held our luggage and let us use the restroom to freshen up. They even said that we could help ourselves to breakfast even though we weren't checked (it was 9:30am). So nice! We returned around 2pm and we were quickly checked in and given our room keys to room 1002. Our luggage was already put in our room. What a great room! Tenth floor, overlooking the street below, with a fabulous view of the Empire State Building. The room was bigger than expected (one king bed), very clean, had a nice little closet, and the shower was great (no tub, but I'm not a bath person). The bed was a dream! The only downside was hearing the sounds of honking cars throughout the night, but after one night, we quickly got used to it. Plus, we ran the fan and it basically zeroed out the traffic noise. The breakfast was very nice with a wide range of items, including English muffins, toast, muffins, bagels, fruit, cereal, scrambled eggs, hard boiled eggs, sausage patties, and juice (orange and cranberry). There was also a coffee station with Starbucks coffee and hot water, with a large assortment of tea and hot chocolate. Yum! On weekdays, breakfast ends at 10am, 11am on weekends.There are also two computers in the breakfast room with printers. What a nice touch! We used the printer three times so we could print tickets for the 9/11 Memorial and Top of the Rock, in addition to our boarding passes And best of all, free Wifi in the room! I find it so crazy that some of the high end hotels out there still charge an arm and a leg for internet access. It's so nice and refreshing when it is included in your stay, free of charge. Did I mention that we got a sweet deal on this room? We booked pretty far in advance, and it was worth it! We checked the price of the room a few days before we left and it had nearly doubled. My husband and I also used the breakfast room one night when we brought our dinner back to the hotel. It was so much nicer than eating in our room. There is a large TV in there and it's very relaxing and no one else was there. For being my first time in NYC, you can't really beat the location. We got around mainly by foot, but we occasionally took the subway which was conveniently located on the half a block away. We walked to most of the sites including Times Square, Theater district, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, High Line, West Village, Chelsea Market, and SoHo. While some of these sites were farther than others, it was so much fun to see the city by foot. A major plus was the local flower market. It was so nice to step outside the hotel and see these beautiful flowers and plants lining the sidewalk. I would definitely recommend this hotel and can't wait to return to NYC.

We wanted to stay somewhere close to Times Square without blowing our budget, and we thought this was a great option.We traveled by Megabus from Washington DC, and we were dropped off very close to this hotel. We were a little early for check in, and they gave us the option of checking in right then, or waiting until actual check in time for a room with a fold-out chair for our daughter. We opted to wait, and they were happy to hold our bags while we killed some time. All of our dealings with the staff were very professional and personable. They even gave our daughter a little cow toy, which she played with the entire stay.The room itself was smaller, but that was to be expected in New York City, and for our short stay we didn't mind it. Our three year old thought the fold out chair was one of the coolest things in the world. For an adult, it would be a little tight, but she slept soundly on it all night. We enjoyed the king bed, it was very comfortable.I'm a big fan of anywhere that offers free breakfast, and this spread did not disappoint. They had lots of good options for all of us. To name a few options, they offered cereals, toast, bagels, yogurts, Del Monte grapefruit and fruit cups, hard boiled eggs, orange and cranberry juice, apples and bananas, coffee and hot chocolate, and Jimmy Dean breakfast sandwiches. It was so nice not to have to worry about breakfast every morning, especially with a child in tow. There was plenty of seating available.The location was great. Walking distance to Time Square and Penn Station, and a Subway station on the same block. Lots of reviews mention the flowers outside, which is true! It is a nice touch.As we checked out, we grabbed some cookies from the front desk. I was impressed with the staff who were friendly and happy.Overall- this was a great deal, with a comfortable, quiet room and free breakfast, and friendly staff. Our room was on the smaller size, but perhaps they offer bigger ones, or this is good for smaller traveling groups. Easy access to public transportation, and also walking distance to many attractions.

And, the room and bathroom were both spotlessly clean.I had paid a little extra for a view room, and got what I paid for: a great view of the Empire State Building.I loved the rooftop deck - the view was outstanding and it was nice to go up there for some fresh air (or a smoke).The staff - particularly those at the front desk - could not have been more friendly and helpful.I loved the Chelsea location - lots of food options nearby, and walking distance to one of my favorite bars/clubs.My only (very minor) complaint was the configuration of the bathroom - when you opened the bathroom door the toilet stuck out and was kind of in the way so you had to open the door all the way to get around the toilet to the sink area. Not a big deal, though. The shower was great and the sink was stylish with plenty of space (including cupboards underneath) to store stuff. I really enjoyed my stay here.

I was in New York for a concert at Madison Square Garden that Saturday night. Ley's begin with the location. It's on West 28th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues. You are going down a street that seems to be all strew front stores, and then poof, you see at tall, skinny, 18 floor hotel that is the Fairfield Inn and Suites.The Lobby: The lobby is a small as everybody says it is. And I could see if a large group showed up, that it could get very, very crowded. That being said, I found the lobby to be clean, the front desk staff to be most pleasant and comfortable. There is a small 4 seat seating area in the front lobby. Straight ahead is a set of 2 elevators which zipped you up to and down from the floors. Around the elevators to the rear is a separate seating area which contained the continental breakfast, which I did not use, but it had the usual bagels, fruit, cereal, and assorted coffees and juices.The Room: I was in room 707 on the 7th floor. As I said the hotel itself is a very skinny building, and the hotel only had maximum of 7 rooms per floor. I have been in some small rooms in my travels over in Europe, and I have to say my room was a very tiny room. That being said, I found the bed to be extremely comfortable, with 5 pillows. The room had a 42 inch plasma/lcd TV mounted on the wall. The room had a small work desk and a small cabinet that held a ironing board, iron, coffee pot with setup and the ice bucket. Plenty of hangars were available, and there was 2 small drawers on the bottom. There is a temperature interface that hooks in with the wall mounted heating/air conditioning unit that is mounted on the wall under the window. When its on heat, it purrs like a kitten, but, when the air conditioning comes on, it is somewhat noisy. However, when the ac is on, it's like the north pole is coming out of the vents, great for a hot day. The window did not have much of a view, basically the buildings next door, so if that is important to you, ask for higher floor. It was not a problem for me.The Bathroom: The bathroom had a 2 person shower, that I found very clean, excellent water pressure, and plenty of hot water. The sink/vanity area was fitted with Koehler faucets. The bathroom had the standard bath soap, body soap, and hair conditioner.The hotel is very conveniently located, only 3 blocks from Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building, etc, and also to plenty of restaurants and bars. Closet subway stop was up on 33rd Street, at least that is what I found.Overall the Hotel is in a great location, close by everything, excellent staff, and a comfortable bed. I was charged $224/night for a King bed, a great price if you ask me. Would definitely stay here again in the future.","Rosedale, New York","jeff672</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rosedale, New York</strong>",8,4.0

Here are some of the things we appreciated most:1. Flower district location -- so cool coming and going. For a city that otherwise smells like cigarettes and sewer, the fresh vibe on this street sets it apart.2. The staff was extremely friendly to me and my kids. Friendly like, offered to call me a cab. Brought me a bottled water while I waited for a cab. A food item had run out at breakfast and one of my daughters asked an employee if they had any more of it and he happily sought it out.

Gave great restaurant suggestions, directions, and other advise. Room was good size, clean, big bathroom, shower only. No refrigerator. Breakfast was typical Fairfield fare, which was fine. Fitness room was also typical. I went to Planet Fitness on 27th to work out.Parking is $25.00 per night if you validate, and is about a block away from hotel.

I stay here due to the amazing proximity for work and really love the location, it's short walk to the subway and other things.But this was an overall subpar visit for two reasons. The first? I arrived from the West coast via a red-eye flight around 11 a.m. on a Sunday morning and was told my room wasn't ready. That was totally cool, as check-in isn't until 3 p.m. However, the woman at the front desk told me she would give me the first open room that became available. I told her I would sit in the small waiting area not 15 feet away from her in her eye line to make sure she remembered I was there and ready. More than two hours later, at least one other person checked in successfully and it was only when I went up and asked if a room was available did she say ""yes,"" which made me irate because she knew I had traveled without sleep to NYC.Second? I woke up Monday morning and prepared to depart. As I was gathering my belongings on the bed, I noticed an array of blood stains all over the white comforter. Absolutely disgusting. I took multiple pictures of the inexcusably laid comforter and delivered my complaint to the desk upon check-out.As a Marriott Rewards and ""Friends & Family"" member who has numerous business associates inside the Marriott Worldwide walls, I was appalled to only receive $20 off my stay having spent thousands of dollars at various Marriott establishments nationwide.This whole experience has made second-guess staying at this property in the future after enjoying every other prior visit.

We came across Marriott's Fairfield Inn on West 28th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues, at the southern edge of Midtown, just a few blocks south of Macy's and the Empire State Building. The Marriott Fairfield is a modern ""no frills"" hotel with a very good room design. Particularly at this price scale, the rooms are ample, not tight, with a king bed, end tables, large screen TV, and a generous number of clothing storage drawers as well as an ample closet. The bathroom has a glass shower although the bathroom was short on shelf space for toiletries. It’s one of the very few hotels we've stayed in, in the U.S. and overseas, where the free wired and wireless Wi-Fi worked very well at all times even in a fully-occupied-hotel. There is a comfortable chat and computer lounge behind the lobby, which is also the food-service area for the free continental breakfast. That space opens into a large enclosed glass atrium with tables and chairs for those lingering over breakfast. Coffee and tea is available at all hours. We had a 2nd floor room facing W. 28th Street, and the room was absolutely quiet. The 2 elevators are fast and responsive. The staff is friendly and accommodating. Subways and buses are nearby, as are some moderately-priced nice eat-in and/or takeout cafes on 7th Ave, as well as some smaller food shops on 6th Ave. Starbucks abound of course. At first glance the block looks dreary, but you'll immediately see two other new hotels across the street. The neighborhood is changing to condo lofts in the old garment factories. Some wholesale and retail flower shops remain on the block. Because of our very satisfactory 6-night-stay at this hotel, Fairfield Inns may well become a brand of choice in the future.","New York City, New York","georgeblomme</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",19,4.0

The bad: in room lighting (we turned all the lamps on in the room and it's still too dark, adaquate,but not bright); rooms are a little on the small size even for NYC (functional 15x15 room but no extra space - basically a bed, desk, and TV with a bathroom down the entranceway); TV service is terrible (OK, who has cable service which doesn't receive any of the major networks including all of those in the city? Let's ditch the oddball channel selections and get normal service - not sure what was going on here as the services book in the room showed a good channel selection, but none of them mapped to what was actually on the TV).

I do think this hotel prices good for it's location in NYC, but NYC hotels are VERY expensive. If you are a senior or AAA member you will get a discount. LOCATION:- very good, just off 6th Avenue and a short walk to the subway on 7th Ave. Right along 7th Ave there are plenty of restaurants and quick service places to get a nice meal or something on the go. There's a McDonalds on the corner of 6th Ave as well. It's right at the tip of Chelsea, so mid-town is maybe a 10-15 minute walk that will get you to Times Square, the theater district, Empire State Building, Macys, etc. Greenwich Village is also a 15 minute walk in the other direction. You'd need to take a subway or taxi to lower Manhattan or Central Park unless you LOVE to walk & explore. The 2 closest major streets are 23rd Street with a lot of stores & restaurants and 34th Street where you will find Macy's, the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden & lots of fast food places nearby. As I said, the lobby is small and comfortable, there is a small sitting area there and outside there is a small area to sit as well. The front desk staff was so friendly and helpful, they really made me feel welcome. THE ROOM - my room was on the 7th floor and I could see the Empire State Building from my window, they gave me a room upgrade which was nice of them. The room isn't terribly large but very comfortable. I had a king bed, which was one of the most comfortable beds I ever slept in. There was a nice flat screen tv with a good amount of channels, a desk with a lamp & electrical outlet, coffee maker with coffee & tea supplied, free WIFI, phone & clock/radio with alarm. There was an iron & ironing board in the closet. The AC kept the room quite chilly if turned up. The window does slide open slightly on each side if you want a bit of fresh air. I don't recall seeing a mini-frig. The bathroom was nice, but small. It was odd how the door opens into the bathroom. When you open the door the sink is then behind the door. So you have to scoot in & close the door to get to the sink. It wasn't a big deal though, it's NYC-space is at a premium. The tub/shower was very nice and after a long day out & about, the shower is very soothing. They had some amenities in the bathroom like a small bottle each of shampoo, conditioner, & lotion. The hotel also offers a complimentary continental breakfast each morning. Unfortunately I slept in and didn't make it down for the breakfast nor did I see the breakfast room - sorry folks! I enjoyed 4th of July evening a little bit too much and got in very late. Speaking of that, we left the hotel around 10-1030pm to go out and even though most stores were closed (McDonalds on the corner was open) & the streets somewhat quiet, we felt very safe walking around the area as well as coming back around 130am from The Village. It is a major city though, so be careful. Parking - NYC is not a good place for a car as it is expensive to park and street parking is extremely difficult to find and you often have to move the car for street cleaning. They have a deal with 2 parking garages within a block from the hotel. I parked at one between 5th & 6th Aves (on 28th St). It is $25 a day for hotel guests and you MUST get your parking voucher validated at the hotel - you pay the garage when you pick the car up. I checked around for less expensive parking but couldn't find any. I would stay at this hotel again.","NJ, USA","JoeytravelerNJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NJ, USA</strong>",59,4.0

Standard breakfast fare included, in a comfortable quiet area opening into an enclosed rear courtyard. The room was well maintained, and our 12th floor view of the Empire State Building a plus.

That said, at the end of a day of walking, sight seeing, going up & down the subway stairs, and eating the great food of the city, you want a comfortable place to lay your head so you can start over the next day. Fairfield Inn fit that bill perfectly! You are in a central location making it easy to go wherever you want in the city and it is clean and comfortable. The rooms are small but anyone complaining about that is spending too much time in their rooms! Next time I head to the city, I would choose this hotel as long as it's still a reasonable price.

From check in- to check out, everything went smooth. We arrived 2-3 hours ahead of check-in time, and were given the room we requested (upgraded to high floor with a view of the Empire state building) right away. They were happy to accomodate our early arrival. Within an hour of arriving in the room, the front desk staff called to ensure everything was okay with our room. It was very comforting to know they were concerned about our needs. Furthermore, the following day the housekeeping staff stopped into the room and asked if we had everything we needed. We asked for additional paper and pens and it was delivered in minutes. Upon inquiring about check out time (noon) and if they could store our bags as we had a late afternoon flight, staff were happy to extend our check out time until 1pm, free of charge. They also offered to store our bags after that time. The rooms were awesome- no complaints about the size, typical for NYC and larger than expected. The bed was SO comfy- best I have ever slept in a hotel. Only minor complaints in regards to the room would be the water from the tap never seemed to get cold and the toilet paper was awkwardly located underneath and behind the toilet.Although all the staff were very friendly and helpful, Mia definitely stood out as one of the best desk staff we have ever encountered. She was so helpful- always giving us restaurant suggestions, directions, and asking how our day was. She had the biggest smile and made us feel so comfortable, welcome and safe.As for the location- the hotel is a 1 minute walk to the Subway that can take you right to Times Square (or a 15-20 minute walk), and a few blocks away from Penn Station where you can access many other Subway routes. The location was perfect as it was away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square (nice quiet street with lovely smelling flowers), but close enough to access shopping there, as well as Herald Square and the Soho district.Food- we tried a few eateries around the hotel that I would suggest. Around the corner is Waldy's Pizza, BRGR, 5 Guys, Triple Crown, and Mustang Sally that are all great CHEAP eats. Of course for breakfast we always filled up on the continental breakfast which was awesome.The hotel was reasonably priced for what it offers, and in the lower lobby you can find a savings rack of coupons for different attractions. We visited the Bodies exhibition and the Museum of Sex both of which I would highly recommend. We also saw Chicago on Broadway- a classic!Overall- a great hotel with awesome staff and service!",Ontario,"Brittw01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ontario</strong>",63,5.0

Upon entering the hotel, you notice the bright lobby & are greeted warmly by he front desk staff. The hotel makes use of every square inch of available space.

You can pick up the subway at almost every street corner and there are taxis everywhere. This specific location 16 West 28th Street, New York City, NY 10001 is literally a five mini walk from Penn Plaza which is the home of Madison Square Garden. To put it mildly, it doesn't get much better then this, you are smack dab in the middle of the fashion district with Fashion Ave a block to the left. With this location comes some typical NYC cautions. After dark outside the street the hotel is on can be dark and uninviting from a security standpoint, however this is NYC. There are always people out walking around and there are tons of apartments in the area over looking the street, so it's not horrible. Take caution after concerts, games or entertainment functions occurring at the Garden, it can get very ""festive"" depending on the event being held.The Hotel Itself: 6/10 I am always a tough person to please, mostly because I stay at so many hotels every month. The hotel itself was built in late 2010 and opened in early 2011, so everything is new. The hotel was built during the big hotel boom occurring in lower NYC, which includes a competitive and equally sized Hilton Garden Inn adjacent to the Fairfield. The entrance to the hotel is nice, small but functional. Towards the back is the breakfast area along with the Internet Cafe machines. See my review below for words on the breakfast, etc.On to the room, I had the ""City View"" package which puts you in the front of the hotel for two weeks in a row. Killer view of the Empire State Building, the higher the room floor the better the view. No complaints with this, however it gets noisy. The front rooms have dual shades that includes a shade plus a noise canceling insulated shade on the outer side which does help substantially but not enough. If you need quiet ask for a room in the back of the hotel, if this doesn't work, bring some noise canceling headphones or even better stay in New Jersey.The showers are full glass with fake marble printed tiles and nicely designed sink area, albeit on a small and tight scale, this is NYC which is to be expected. No more then 2 midsized people in the bathroom at a time. The shower is actually quite large, almost half the size of the bathroom itself which begs to question the design choice. The toilet is always in the way with a tiny sink and huge shower. Not sure what the designers were thinking on that one, again, I am being very particular about this!I had two different rooms on each of my week stays at this hotel. The first hotel had a bathroom door that seemed to have been forgotten about during the assemble stage. You have be behind the toilet and angled in a certain position to close the door or it will whack you in the face, knees or legs. Better yet, we are talking about maybe an inch between the door closing and the toilet, make sure no one tries opening the door while you are doing your business or you going for a ride with a few choice words on the way down. A pocket door would have solved this completely, and there even seemed to be plenty of room for on in the wall. Be careful on the nightly runs to toilet too, it gets worse in the dark!The second stay I was on the opposite side of the hotel with a slightly different layout with a much more functional door and bathroom layout, but still had a huge shower with a rain shower head, nice, but still odd design choice and questionable functionality.The Staff/Checkin-Checkout Process: 5/10 The Achilles heal for this hotel is its front desk staff. It's not that they aren't helpful, they are too busy. At some points there was only one person working the counter for a hotel with 200 rooms in downtown Manhattan? Unacceptable. They need two people working at all times at the front desk, especially during the morning and afternoon hours when guests are checking in and out. The checkout process was fine for me each time, basically handing my key card to the person and walking out. This included stepping in front of a line of four people checking in. The need for a faster check in/out process can't be stressed more. Another issue is the elevators are directly in front of the front desk. This makes it challenging when people are lined up at the front desk, getting it of the elevator with luggage and maneuvering around people with their own luggage is not fun. On the other side of the coin, placing the elevator on the other side, exiting in the breakfast area poses another problem, a very narrow corridor to bring bags through to the front. So I guess this a typical design challenge when you have very little room to work with in NYC. You will always have an issue or problem somewhere design choices have to be made. It works, just not well!!Breakfast/Coffee/Internet Access 4/10 Yes that's a four! I was very disappointed in the breakfast layout at this hotel. I have stayed in many Fairfield Hotels and they usually do a great job with the continental breakfast. The problem with this location was specifically the layout! Items are all over the place in the breakfast room with what looks to be last minute shelving installed and questionable placement of every single item. Zero flow in this area, when I am up at 6AM and want a nice NYC bagel, it shouldn't take me 10 minutes to walk around the room to find a knife, then the cream cheese. If you want a coffee that's at another location in a small tiny corner, one person at a time in this area to get coffee, yes, I said one person. Wait until 8AM when ten people want coffee, failed design choice on this. The food was fine and typical Fairfield items served, nothing to knock your socks off and the coffee was drinkable ""Cheap"" Starbucks.Internet- Blatent FAIL. I actually reported this directly to Marriott corporate. If you have a hotel in the busiest city in the world, with the utmost best location, the LAST thing you skip on is the Internet access. Speed tests were horrible, 1.5MB/1MB up in the morning with hardly cracking dial up speeds in the evening. Come on Marriott, this is NYC you HAVE NO EXCUSE not to have the best or at least a corporate connection for the location. If you have work to do, take a walk down to Panera Bread a half block away, they have Fios 20/10 line that smokes. Final Words: 6/10 I am going to admit, I was especially hard on this review. I am sure many other long term customers may not find my issues nearly as bad. This was straight from a weekly traveler that has had fair share of nose dives in NYC. I think overall, even with a 6, this hotel is great. Why? It's location saves it from complete failure. No, not its location in terms of placement but because its IN NYC and many other hotels are just ten times worse unless you pay big bucks. With that said, the place is still new, and I really think with some corporate changes such as faster Internet, more personnel at the front desk (STOP PUTTING ME ON HOLD!!!), a redesign on the breakfast layout and finally, please, for the love of all will someone at Marriott corporate get rid of the Starbucks coffee?! Have you ever heard of Green Mountain??? Bottom Line: Nice hotel, couple issues that can be resolved by management or corporate. RFID key cards which are super cool. Great beds and clean rooms. Noisy in the front, as expected. Will stay here again and see if they improve with (one) persons honest review. Oh and get better coffee. Safe travels all.","Scranton, Pennsylvania","Bella213</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scranton, Pennsylvania</strong>",73,4.0

I was very pleasantly pleased that the majority were spot on. This hotel was great. From the moment I arrived until I left there was excellent customer service. I received a call when I got to my room to check on things and the day before I left as well. I forgot to request a room with a view of the Empire State Building, but I got one (room 1406). I had also made a request with Marriott to have a refrigerator in my room and one was brought up within minutes of checking in. The breakfast was good as well (fruits, eggs, breakfast sandwiches, muffins/bagels, cereals, and drinks). They offer free internet and I didn't have any problems using my iPad with that. Everyone that said the bed was comfortable was right - I slept so well there. The room is average size (I would say for any city pretty much actually - not any smaller because it was NYC). If you want to buy any sodas - they are only $1.50 there in the machines on the lower floor - Duane Reade and Walgreens are both just over $2 each for the same size (Pepsi products - not a huge choice, but still). There are two different subway lines within walking distance (the N/R and the 1). I was coming back to my room anywhere from 10 p.m. to midnight just about every night and I felt relatively safe walking by myself - most nights there were a few others on the street as well - this was after taking the 1 line back on the subway. Just a few blocks away is Penn Station, Macy's, and Times Square. But if you prefer to stay away from Times Square (as I do except for the Broadway plays), this is an excellent place to stay. This hotel is actually in the Flower District and not in Chelsea, but Chelsea is not that far away at all. The sidewalks are crowded during the day because of the flower shops and the pedestrian traffic (just keep moving on the sidewalks so the locals don't get mad at you), but the noise from the deliveries never bothered me as did the traffic (horns, sirens, etc.). I don't know if their windows are triple paned as some of the other hotels I've stayed at are, but I can sleep through most anything. I've already recommended this hotel to a high school friend who is thinking of staying in the city next time instead of Long Island with family. I will definitely try to stay at this hotel again in the future if I can get the same AAA price I had this time (I booked early enough that my rate was only $151/night May 27-June 2 which was an excellent deal).

The rooms were on different floors and both had a decent view of the city. We did not have buildings within spitting distance of our rooms as others have mentioned. Yes, the rooms are smaller than what you'd get elsewhere, but this is NYC and that is to be expected. The hotel lobby and rooms are very modern, clean, and tastefully decorated. The staff at this property is outstanding - very friendly and helpful, no attitude. We felt very safe walking at night in that area. It was wonderful to see and smell all the flowers and flowering shrubs set out on the sidewalks as we approached the hotel. There is a subway station about a block away. We never heard any noise inside our room from the city, traffic, or elevators - I don't understand why others have griped about the elevator chiming. I suppose if your room was right next to the elevator, you could probably hear that but that's the case in every hotel. Breakfast was a nice surprise - I had expected it to be absolutely mobbed with people on a Sunday morning and it was quite the opposite. There were only a handful of people in the dining area, the food was plentiful and fresh, and the whole experience was actually very relaxing. You can even sit in the adjoining sunroom to enjoy breakfast. I would not hesistate to stay at this property again and would highly recommend it to others. The only improvement suggestion I would offer is to put more seating on the rooftop patio. There were only two or three plastic seats/tables up there, so we had to sit on the concrete patio to socialize.

We were so impressed that the person who handled the reservation had conveyed to the hotel that we were coming to the City to celebrate my husband's birthday and that the staff took it upon themselves to make our stay extra special.

Too much room is consumed by a standard sized desk and swivel chair and there was no other furniture for seating- only the bed.

We arrived at around 9 am to find our room had been sold (the night before), so there was nothing ready for us (and our sleeping 4 year old). The front desk receptionist, Danny, invited us to enjoy their breakfast and kick back in the solarium - which we did. They had a room cleaned and ready to go about an hour later - and it was magnificent! Certainly worth waiting for - with amazing views of the Empire State Building (I had no idea it changed light colors regularly, (to the delight of our daughter) - so far its been blue and green, and tonight it is purple and yellow). The caliber of service is beyond expectations - more on the lines of the Ritz Carlton sort of experience, if they were to do a mid range property. ""Yes Sir, No Ma'am and it's MY pleasure"" are common starters. They really DO care if you are enjoying your experience with them - which suggests they have a good management team allowing them to focus on the client/customer and not their bottom line, (which increases due to their amazing service - and it gets better!).Back to our room. First thing that comes to mind is 'CLEAN'. We had a king size bedroom for myself, husband and our daughter - that was so comfortable even our 4 year old had a hard time pushing the ceiling off her to get going in the morning! The walk in shower has excellent pressure and HOT water! The entire space is well appointed, and modern in the amenity department. But the bed. Seriously nice. Linens and mattress. Flat screen tele with a variety of stations (not sure what is 'in' these days as we do not have cable at home) and a good size closet. Starbucks coffee is served in room (blech), but it is better than whatever cheapy stuff is the norm at this rate. There's a desk with a comfortable chair for working (my husband agreed) and plenty of light. The continental breakfast is just right, (if you were only here for a day or two), hard boiled eggs, refrigerator pancakes, Jimmy Dean biscuits with meat of some sort for the microwave, juice from the tap, bagels or English muffins, Starbucks coffee or a variety of hot teas, milk, yoghurt and bananas and a variety of cereals.

We have stayed at a bunch of hotels giving us a good perspective of what works and what doesn't. Overall we would recommend this hotel.Pros:1. Located at 28th and 6th. Easy access to subways, walking distance to Chelsea and west village area and restaurants. Being on the west side is easy to get around. 2. Clean. Room is clean, good views, not loud, has the amenities we needed. Asked for a fridge and even though the actual person who brought it up was grumpy it wasn't a big deal.3. Breakfast. Even though it's NYC and food is abundant it's nice to start out with some fruit, coffee, cereal before heading out. Plus you can get free Starbucks coffee, tea, or hot cocoa any time of day. 4. Parking. There is a lot rate during the week of $25 per day which is good for NYC and you can easily find free street parking in this area for the weekend.5. Staff. Friendly, helpful and gave us free bottled water as needed. Cons:1. Room size. Having stayed at Bryant park hotel and millennium Hilton those rooms and bathrooms are bigger. This time the rate here was cheaper and that's why we switched. For two people it's fine although the bathroom is super small and nowhere to really put your stuff. We had a small baby so with the crib, stroller, etc it was cramped. We even upgraded to larger room and it wasn't much bigger than standard and I'm not sure worth the $30 extra per night.

In looking for the right hotel, our top concerns were location, cleanliness and price-to-value. We chose Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriot in Chelsea because of all the positive reviews on TripAdvisor and the reputation of the Marriot brand. As a native New Yorker, I knew when booking the hotel that $200/night was inexpensive by Manhattan standards and was looking forward to our stay. On January 15th, we arrived a couple hours before the afternoon check-in time. Although we had informed the hotel of an early check-in during reservation, we didn’t expect to get a room until the afternoon and was looking to drop off our luggage before exploring NYC. However, unlike the warm and friendly welcome other customers raved about online, the lady working the front desk was a bit rude and condescending. She did not acknowledge I was standing there until after a 5-minute conversation with another employee about her night and when she finally did address me, I was told to wait since no rooms were available. I asked to store our luggage in the meantime and she told the concierge to bring our suitcases to the backroom, which we found out later was an outdoor breakfast area where guests can go in and out. For a hotel that can demand rates up to $400/night, which is roughly in the same price range as some of the nicer boutique hotels, there should be a delegated storage area to ensure belongings are secure. The hotel itself is new, modern and nicely decorated. In terms of the room, it was decently sized and very clean. Sheets were crisp and the king size bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom, however, was not designed for ease-of-use as you will find yourself struggling to close the door without hitting against the toilet. My boyfriend and I have been to several Marriot locations both in the United States and in Europe and this bathroom was definitely the smallest one. Also, when we booked several months ago, we requested a high floor since we heard lower floors experience loud traffic noise and a less beautiful view of the city. I was disappointed to have been given a low floor room but we were still able to see the Empire State Building from our window. The central location of the hotel was a definite plus as we were able to walk four blocks to the nearest N/R metro station and some tourist attractions, such as the largest Macy’s and Koreatown. The complimentary breakfast and WiFi were also great additions to the hotel package. I think if the hotel focuses more on customer service from the moment you walk into the hotel and have a better/safer process of storing luggage for guests, it has the potential to be a great bang for your buck.",New York City,"Michelle C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City</strong>",2,3.0

It is in Chelsea and 1 block from 2 different subway lines. If you have a car they have a special rate with the garage on the next block: $25 for 25 hours. That rate is hard to beat in NYC. Everyone here is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is included in the rate. They have a nice assortment of items including bagels, english muffins, pancakes, yogurt, cereals, etc. Also some delicious pastries. Juice and coffee of course. The breakfast bar is well supervised so it is stocked and clean. The rooms are NYC small but very adequate in size. Very clean with nice bathrooms. Also, the bathrooms are NYC small. The shower is large, however. The beds are very, very comfortable. In the lobby is a nice touch. There is a water cooler with orange flavored water. Great for when returning after a warm NY day.

I stay at Marriott brand hotels many times a year but rarely have had opportunities to stay at a Fairfield. This one, in my opinion, was very impressive for such an affordable hotel. It is located on 28th, between 6th & 7th, in the Flower District (NOT in Chelsea but it is a quick train ride!). I arrived hours before check in and they already had a room ready which was unexpected so I was immediately pleased. The room was very clean and comfortable. I have been going to NYC a couple of times a year for many years so I have stayed in several other hotels in town. In my opinion, this room is a pretty decent size for rooms in this city. This area is very quiet at night so I had no problems with a lot of noise when I was trying to sleep. The bed is one of the most comfortable I've slept in. The bathroom is very nice and has a huge, walk-in shower, with great water pressure. The AC works GREAT. There is no fridge in the room and no safe. The lack of safe is actually a bit disappointing. I've become accustomed to having a safe in all NYC hotel rooms that I've stayed in. Also, there is only one ice-maker in the building and it's located on the lower level which is a bit of an inconvenience but luckily the elevators are quick so you don't have to wait too long to get down there and back.  I loved the location. It's really convenient to so many of the city's attractions. It's just blocks from the Empire State Building/Harold Square, which is probably the best shopping located in this area. It's equally close to the Flatiron District, Madison Square Park, Madison Square Gardens, Penn Station, etc. If you make it to the Flatiron District, be sure to check out Eataly, Mario Batali's Italian mega-store. It's amazing. There is also a Whole Foods a few blocks away along with several other little markets if you're looking for the basics. There is a Starbucks and Bank of America, both located at the corner of 28th & 6th. This hotel is located a block from the red line (i.e 1-2-3 train) subway. This train will take you to or close to, just about anywhere in the city you'd like to go. By far, the best kept secret of this hotel is the roof deck. It has an amazing view of the Empire State Building. Be sure to check it out at night. It is open 24 hours a day and there was rarely anyone up there so I usually had it to myself. It's nothing fancy but definitely a nice spot to chill out and enjoy a great view of the city. They also provide a complimentary breakfast, every morning, and it has pretty good offerings. Muffins, bagels, cereals, breakfast sandwiches, yogurt, etc. They also serve Starbucks brand coffee. I would also like to mention that the customer service was outstanding. One night, I needed three things; scissors, super glue and a map. I went to the front desk and asked Andrew if he had these items and within seconds, he provided all three. I thought for sure super glue wouldn't be something on hand but turns out, it was. On my last day, Mika arranged my transportation to the airport and also had my luggage held between check out time and the time I actually left. Not to mention the countless others who were very accommodating, as well. Everyone was just very friendly and it was very much appreciated. I look forward to staying at this hotel again in the future and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet, clean, comfortable and affordable place to stay in the city.","Memphis, Tennessee","MBCMemphis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Memphis, Tennessee</strong>",13,5.0

My fiance and I were traveling to New York to look for an apartment and arrived early on a Tuesday morning (at 8:00 a.m. - well before the afternoon check-in time). We had expected to just drop off our luggage, but were warmly greeted by the staff and invited in to the dining area for a hot breakfast (a welcome invitation after starting our day at 3:00 a.m. that morning). When we returned that evening after an exhausting day of touring apartment buildings and New York neighborhoods, we were again greeted with complementary wine and cookies. The staff all gathered around to hear about our day as though we were old friends and poured us a second glass as we shared the details of our day. They seemed as genuinely excited as we were. These were small touches that made an incredible difference for our trip. The rooms were very comfortable and appeared to be recently updated. They were a decent size by New York standards and very clean with all the amenities you'd expect in the best managed Marriott hotels. The general manager was a fixture in the lobby throughout the day and likely deserves much of the credit for leading such an apparently well run hotel.","New York City, New York","cweppes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",0,5.0

Both were very good, but I liked the former better, but that's for another review.) For 30,000 Marriott points, my out of pocket cost at this hotel was zero. Because we checked into the hotel early, our upper floor room was not ready, so we agreed to stay in Room 207 on the second floor. Room 207 was absolutely the smallest hotel room I had ever seen. It was smaller than my office. My estimate of the room size, not counting the bathroom, is 8 feet by 12 feet. (Maybe Andre can provide the exact dimensions when he sees this review.) From what I can tell, all of the rooms are situated around the two elevators. I can only assume that this is the smallest room size in the hotel and that my reserved room would have been larger. Perhaps Andre can arrange for a partial credit of some Marriott points back into my account.I must say that I was able to sleep later than I had over the past year or so. This room was very quiet since it is situated on the backside of 28th street as opposed to being on the front side. My wife said that she heard the elevators every time they stopped on our floor, but I did not hear a thing. The mattress was very comfortable too.Because the hotel has been in operation since December 2010, according to what I was told by one of the hotel staff, everything was in fine working order and the room was very clean. The room had a nice high def TV, probably about 42 inches or so.This room is fine for a one night stand, or if you're in NYC for business, this room will do. The breakfast that comes with the room is one of the best of seen for this type of arrangement. The breakfast room is very nicely laid out and a good place to hang out at the end of the night before retiring to the room. There's a nice large flat screen TV and two computers available to use at no charge. The location is not bad either. Its an easy walk up to Times Square and the Theatre District. Or, if you're lazy you can take the subway which is only a block away.

As luck would have it, our Amtrak train from BWI was delayed as all rail traffic was between Washington DC and New York. We had no choice but to drive into the city.We paid for this hotel using our Marriott points. The location was on a relatively quiet street, but since it was a Fairfield, there was no designated space to temporarily park your car to unload the luggage. So a deluge of honks erupted as we tried to get our bags out of the trunk. No valet, no doorman, no nothin. To be expected since this Marriott property falls into the value category, but when you are in NY things like this matter. Had we paid for the night it would have been close to $300 which is highway robbery.After finding a cart and unloading the luggage, I wheeled it into the tiny lobby and my husband drove down the street to park the car (several blocks). The rates were not bad for NY. It wasn't their garage, but with a stamp from the front desk, you ended up paying $30/night. Since the hotel was new, it was very clean and modern. The room was small but very nicely decorated. There was no tub, but not being a bath person, I appreciated the larger walk in shower. The breakfast room was great and they had a nice selection for a continental even having some pre-wrapped egg sandwiches to nuke for your enjoyment. I had woken up early and headed to the McDonald's at the corner for coffee so we only enjoyed some fruit from the small buffet.All in all, this was a very decent property, but for the rates?????

The reverse is true to exit the bathroom. Problem is the door is hinged on the right whereas it should have been hinged on the left (or open outwards). Not sure why this hasn't been fixed. Also not sure why the arm on the desk chair is falling off for lack of tightening a screw. The only other area that could be improved in the room (not bathroom) lighting which was very poor even with all lamps on.  But for NYC this is a good hotel choice.

The lobby is fairly small with just a few chairs. I was greeted warmly by the front desk clerk. As a Gold, I inquired about an upgrade and snagged an Executive King on the 16th Floor. The hotel has 18 floors plus a penthouse.The room is better than average size for NYC. The decor is quite attractive with light brown (sand) wallpaper and carpeting and black furniture.It also has a large sliding glass ""balcony"" door which spans from the floor to within a foot of the ceiling. Unfortunately, you can only open this door about a foot. Their is no actual balcony, only a metal railing to protect you from falling. Nevertheless, the door allows in plenty of light to make the room seem bigger plus a great view of the Empire State Building.The closet and bathroom are small, but the glass shower stall is large enough for two people. The shower stall is fully enclosed, unlike some other new hotels with a half a door. The vanity is made of black stone with copper flecks (as is the work desk). There is plenty of room for toiletries on the vanity and on both sides of the cabinet below.The bed was very comfortable. I noticed some street noise but not any noise from the hall or nearby rooms.The TV is a 37-inch Philips flat screen with 39 channels, none of which were available in HD. I would expect a lot more channels and HDTV in a new hotel! The work desk is large and free wired and wireless internet is available. You do need to get a password from the front desk to connect.There is a fitness center and vending machines on the lower level. Breakfast is served from 7 AM to 10 AM on the lobby level.
