No lobby area, no bar, no concierge, no room service! To be fair the room wasn’t too bad - toiletries etc provided with reasonable towels and slippers. No gown, no safe, very basic tea / coffee making facilities, one uncomfortable pillow and an ok ish mattress. Room was exceptionally clean and a reasonable size (a corner room with 4 windows and a view, the rest look tiny if the fire plan on the back of the door is anything to go by) with minimal storage space. It looks as if the rooms and corridors have been refurbished. Breakfast was ok with an omelette station, yogurt, tinned fruit (what’s that all about! Think 1970’s!) and good bakery items. The hotel is in a great position slap bang in the middle of Ginza. The metro station is only about 30 metres from the front door and about 20 mins walk to Tokyo station. We were only here for 4 nights with hand luggage, and this was not our first trip to Tokyo, so for us this wasn’t a problem.

Our room was very small however with barely enough leg room either side of the queen size bed. The usual modular bathroom/toilet which is common in Japan was the ensuite. Again small but functional. I have to save though my partner and I are average sized adults. Larger people may struggle for room. The only other negative is the air-conditioning. In short, the in room air conditioning doesn’t work. Some sort of central air-conditioning prevailed and it kept the room too hot and stuffy. We had to call room service to unlock a window so we could open it to let cooler air in. That in turn let in the city noise. Not good.

Breakfast was such a let down. I have never had to queue for breakfast in a hotel!!!! I was there on a business trip and wanted to get in and out but there was a queue and this obviously wasn't unusual as there were chairs lined up outside! You had to have a coupon (when someone turned up without one an older couple the staff were not that friendly to them about it). Then they eventually showed you to a table and presented you with a tacky plastic cafeteria tray with a plate, cutlery and a cheap nasty serviette!! What a disgrace! Sitting in a large room that was decorated opulently with chandeliers and table cloths and a plastic cafeteria tray!!!! The tables were large and room layout was poor. A bit of proper design and the room could easily fit more people very comfortably and still look nice. There was an overflow room the next morning - yet I still had to queue. That room was so brightly lit and poor layout I really did feel I was sitting in a cafeteria. The food was... ""okay"" quite average. I had told myself if I had to queue the next day I wasn't as the food was not worth it. But there was only one person so I waited. The last day I didn't bother.

Amenities are older but service is as good.I prefer the bed in this hotel and pillows are feather and down. Love it or hate it, depending on your preference.Location wise, right smack in the premier shopping district with numerous subway and train stations within 10 minutes walking distance.Convenience stores can be found just across the street and many foodjoints and restaurants nearby to suit any budget. We almost always have our dinner at Yurakucho, below the JR train track before going back to the hotel.Although we will choose our previous because it is newer, this hotel is also highly recommended for the size of the rooms (Tokyo standards) and convenience of l9cation with food, shopping and public transportation nearby.Oh yes, rooms are clean and maintenace of the rooms is up to mark.","Singapore, Singapore","Vince-Helena</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",43,4.0

Shutterbug07 gave an extremely comprehensive review of the position and sizing of the rooms. All that I wish to add is that we found the hotel quite bleak. Yes, the position was excellent and for Japanese hotel rooms a reasonable size but the rooms were quite dark and bland. There were no decorations or anything to increase the attractiveness of the room. I'm not sure what the flooring was - linoleum perhaps but it gave the room a very 'clinical' feel. My biggest criticism was that the corridor up to our room was constantly filled with all the cleaning products and utensils and worse, all the dirty bags of laundry collected from nearby rooms. These piles remained there for a greater part of the day - it was very off-putting. I have never encountered this at any of the hotels we have stayed in - particularly through Japan. It gave a somewhat 'unclean' aura. Also the lifts were in a state of disrepair with unfinished walls. The reception area is small and what would be called a lobby area was particularly uninviting and not the cleanest. Staff were efficient for both check-in and -out but for the rest unengaged and disinterested. Needless to say we cancelled our scheduled second stay for the last leg of our trip in this hotel and booked another hotel in Tokyo.In summary, if position and price are all that you require, this hotel is fair.

It's around an 8-10min walk if I remember correctly. It's tucked away in a quiet sidestreet, yet it's very accessible as there are train stations a few hundred feet away (Ginza Station, Ginza-Itchome Station, etc.). We just had trouble upon our arrival from Narita airport because we just took the airport limousine bus and got dropped off at a designated Ginza station. It could be quite difficult to find the hotel on foot if you don't know its exact location. But after that, we didn't have much trouble anymore. Across the street from the hotel, there is a Family Mart; and a Tomod's pharmacy and convenience store is just a corner away. That was great because that's where we bought our bottled water and snacks. There are a few small restaurants nearby, as well. There are a few high-end stores around, too (Tiffany & Co., Itoya, etc.). As mentioned, the main shopping avenue is just an 8-10min walk away. Stores such as Prada, Bulgari, Uniqlo, etc. could be found there. There are also Department Stores such as Matsuya Ginza. Of course, there are a number of higher-end restaurants to try, too. It's a great location, I don't think anyone will get bored staying there. We also just walked going to the Imperial Palace grounds. It's a bit of an effort on foot (around 2km), but there are so many things to see on the way there so you won't really notice the distance.The hotel itself is quaint. The decor is more trendy than modern, with a bit of a hipster vibe. The lobby is quite small, but it wasn't crowded when we went so it wasn't a problem. Also, the reception staff was efficient so whenever there was a line, turnover was quite quick. They also have a parking area in the building, although we didn't have a car so we didn't get to try it. They also have a restaurant, but we didn't get to try that, too, so I can't comment on the food. The area around the hotel was very clean.My friend and I stayed in a standard Double room, while my parents lucked out and were assigned a Double room, but a corner one (we booked through Booking.com). Our room was good enough for us. There was enough room for our luggage (1 luggage each), and there was a small cabinet where we could hang our jackets. The bed was big enough for the both of us to fit comfortably. They provided bedroom slippers, as well as pajamas. We liked that very much. There was a small desk, one sofa chair, and one desk chair. There wasn't much room to move / lounge around, we were more or less limited to lounging on the bed, but the room was just a place to sleep anyway so we were fine. The size of the bathroom was okay, too. They had a high-tech toilet (with heater, bidet, etc.), a sink, and a tub with a shower. They also had enough racks to hold our towels and clothes. There were toiletries provided, water pressure was strong, and hot water was readily available. There was ample lighting, an electric kettle, small refrigerator, cups and glasses, and a humidifier. There was also a flat-screen tv, but only had mostly local Japanese channels. My parents' room was pretty much the same, except they had a little more space since they had a corner room. Both had views of the street outside (no building blocking the natural light).We didn't need much customer service from them, but during our limited interaction with them, their staff was polite and approachable.Some comments:1. The central airconditioner / heater could get too warm at night. We didn't know how to adjust the temperature to make the room cooler. We just adjusted and resorted to either not using the comforter blanket, or turning on the humidifier to have some cold air circulating. It didn't bother us too much, though, because we were always so tired when we got back to the hotel that falling asleep right away wasn't too difficult.2. Please consider adding more English channels to the TV channel line-up. The only English channel was a news channel (NHK World, I think) with the featured shows replaying over and over. Although it was actually quite entertaining to watch Japanese shows, the language barrier could get a bit suffocating after a while. English channels similar to those in Hongkong hotels would do -- National Geographic, Discovery Channel, and any English movie channel.Overall, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel. It was comfortable, and good place to come home to after a day of exploring. It's smaller than we're used to; however, I do believe it's bigger than a lot of other Japanese hotel rooms. Plus, the location was really great.","Muntinlupa, Philippines","shutterbug07</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Muntinlupa, Philippines</strong>",31,4.0

Too small for us and all our luggage at the beginning of a three week Japanese tour. I sort of expected this given the reasonable price, so I'm not really complaining. Bathroom was good, and the public areas had a good feel except there was no lobby lounge to speak of. Lots of character in the decor, and felt Japanese rather than generic. It's hard to know the best area to stay in Tokyo but Ginza is good for world brand as well as boutique Japanese shopping, restaurants, lovely little lanes and of course ease of getting to other places.

Its dour and miserable and too small to sit in.Hotel reception staff, however , were extremely helpful and I congratulate them on the high level of service which they offered. This was in stark contrast to those who organised breakfast. First, you have to present your ticket to someone akin to an army major. Lord help you if you forget your breakfast ticket or walk uninvited into the dining room! On the first morning, I had to queue for breakfast for nearly thirty minutes. Eventually, I was seated and accessed the rather limited variety of food on offer. Another morning, the bacon ran out and that entailed a fifteen minute wait. If you are lucky, you might be seated in the main dining area. On the other hand, you might be seated in a dismal room further away . Should this happen, you have to get your food on a tray and walk out of the main area.The room was disappointingly small but it was clean with all facilities in working order. The bed was comfortable and the room quiet. Mine was a no-smoking room but the corridor did smell of smoke on two or three occasions - a real ""turn off"" for me.The hotel certainly has potential but needs a manager who will drag it into the twenty first century.

We took the Narita Express to Tokyo station and rather than messing around to figure out the subway lines at night with our luggage, simply took a quick cab ride to the hotel. Check in was quick- no concerns. Service in general was good although we did not need their assistance too much. One night, we had asked them if they could help us make a reservation at a restaurant for dinner. They didn't do it, but we just went to the restaurant and made the reservation ourselves so no harm done.The location is perfect. Subway stops are close by and we never had to arrange for a cab ahead of time since there was always someone parked around the corner (i.e. at 0400 in the morning for a ride to Tsukiji market!). It was also really nice that at the end of a busy day (and night), that we could go back to the quiet and calm of Ginza. You feel a bit out of the action when you leave an area like Shibuya or Shinjuku, but we like it that way :) There is a lot of shopping around and many restaurants and bars, both modern and traditional, expensive and economical, to keep one busy for a very long time!We didn't go for the breakfast at the hotel, but its not hard to find a coffee shop or restaurant where ever you plan on being in the morning.The hotel room itself is nothing to be excited about, but it is clean and very quiet. The high ceilings are nice and distracts from the weathered looking floor.

The location of this hotel is ideal as it is in the center of everything, it is right next to a subway station (Ginza-Itchome station) and is in the heart of Ginza. In addition, it is a 5 minute walk from Misukoshi- a popular department and food store in Ginza. It is also nearby many convenience stores (as in 7/11s and Family Marts) and restaurants. When staying in Tokyo and looking for good location, this is the place. 2. The staff at the hotel was very kind to us and immediately helped us with every need. 3. The rooms were large for rooms in Tokyo, and the beds were very comfortable. There was also an in room refrigerator in case you need to store food or drinks. They had a very little amount of English channels, however, they had a large English/American movie selections. The wifi in the room was excellent and I never did not have signal. But, my major complaint is breakfast. I thought breakfast was going to be huge and have variety. I was greatly mistaken. I am vegetarian , but the lack of variety really disturbed me. The breakfast is mainly Japanese style and had some breads and egg omelet station. Be aware, these are Japanese egg omelets so they taste different. This breakfast is not meant for westerners. If you really want to dive into what a Japanese breakfast is like, than it is ideal. Additionally, the staff at breakfast took a very long time to replenish food. Bottom line: I do not recommend going to this breakfast. There are many other hotels close by and you can get a better breakfast for a lower price. For example, the Courtyard Marriott Ginza has an unbelievable breakfast with a lot of variety and is cheaper than the Hotel Monterey Ginza breakfast. Another complaint is that because it is a smaller hotel, many tours do not pick up from the hotel. So you may have to go to a larger hotel nearby where tours can pick you up. The staff, however, are very helpful in arranging tours and transportation. I would recommend staying at this hotel if location is the most important to you. It has an ideal location in the Ginza district and you can connect from the subway close by to anywhere in Tokyo(since Tokyo Metro system is very advanced). If you want to sacrifice a good breakfast, and a larger type of hotel, than this hotel is really for you. For my purposes, I had a perfect Tokyo stay.

Walking distance to all train stations and was helpful as it was easy to navigate the city from the hotel. The hotel location was also clearly marked on all train maps within the subways, which is even better as you don't ever have to worry about getting lost or not being sure which exit to take. Key locations close to the hotel includes the Tsukiji fish market, the Noh theatre, Ginza shopping district, with many eateries, small shops and boutiques, and a convenience store right opposite. The hotel staff speaks English so there was no issue with communication, and was also flexible in storing our bags for us in concierge when we arrived early, and when we left later in the day for our flight. Key things to note:1. The hotel room is small, and we had huge bags as we were traveling long distance with Tokyo being our first stopover. So it was a huge challenge trying to lug our heavy bags up and down the subway stairs (no lift). And we hardly had any space to open and spread our things in the small room - but you just have to find a way. 2. The bed is small - so if you're almost 6 feet, your feet will probably be dangling off the side of the bed, and it will be quite a cozy sleeping experience. 3. There was no air con during the winter, so just air - and it can get stuffy. So do ask the front desk to have their technician open the room windows slightly to allow the air in, if you need to.

We arrived from Haneda airport and took the Keikyu airport line straight to Higashi Ginza station. We exited the station at exit A8 and the hotel was literally a small block and a half away. The trip took roughly 25 min. The hotel is located very close to many other subway stations as well. The Ginza-Itchome station (Y19) is a block away, the Ginza station is 5 blocks away and the JR Yurakucho station is 7 blocks away. Thus, it gives great access to many subway lines to navigate the sprawling city. The JR Yurakucho station gives easy access to the monorail which has express trains to Haneda airport via Hamamatsucho station. The hotel is a 730 yen taxi ride from Tokyo station. It is also a short walk from the Marriott hotel which the Hatobus company (which offers many sightseeing tours) uses as a possible pick up location.The hotel is located literally 3 small streets away from the heart of Ginza, an area full of upscale restaurants and shops. It is full of day long hustle bustle (on weekends they close the streets to vehicles due the sheer number of pedestrians). Most stores usually open at 11am and close late into the evening. Ginza is famous for its large department stores. For me (the food lover), the most impressive were the basements of these department stores specifically those of the Mitsukoshi Ginza department store (the most popular) but the Matsuya Ginza as well. The sheer offerings and varieties of food vendors in these basements are something to take in!!!There are 2 convenience stores directly outside of this hotel to meet most, if not all of your needs. The Kabuki theatre is 5 blocks away and the Tsukiji fish market is a short walk away.This hotel is clean and rather roomy in my opinion for Tokyo standards. There was also free WiFi.

No extra charge.We landed in Narita and took the Narita Express. The lady there gave us the wrong tickets, so the conductor asked for $19 additional for each passenger. There is a Tokyo Direct Ticket that will cost you $15 only for this leg only. Does not work when going to Narita. We ended up paying $30 for each.....argh. And trying to explain the issue to the conductor when we cannot speak Japanese was getting us nowhere. We turned on our roaming to get service to show him the website but no connection.

Eventually, you will see signs for the Yaesu South exit. Look for the Taxi sign. Go outside and get in line. We had to take 2 taxis as we had two 28 inches and three 22 inches. I asked the first taxi to let the second taxi know. I can't speak Japanese but with gestures, the driver understood. The first taxi was 820 yen. Second taxi was 730 yen. It took but 5 min? to get to the hotel.The front desk was very friendly and helpful. We have asked for places to eat, directions, etc.They reserved a taxi for us to go back to Tokyo station. We got a van taxi, so we all can fit. Cost us 2500 yen. We also asked to extend the checkout of one of the 2 rooms. We payed 1000 yen per hour of extension.Now we have connecting rooms. And unlike in US, you need a key to lock the doors between the rooms. Not knowing Japanese, we struggled to explain that we needed the door locked since we are only extending the 1 room. Did not want the new guests on the other room to have access. In the end, I asked the cleaning lady and showed her the unlocked door. And with that and gestures, she understood and called the front desk. Voila, mission accomplished, someone came up and locked the door.The rooms have shampoo, conditioner, body liquid soap, hand and face liquid soap. They also provide, shavers, toothbrush, comb, hair clip, cotton buds, slippers to keep. They also have pajamas but those you cannot keep.They have a small fridge that has beverages for purchase. A hot water machine if you want yo make coffee. We did not use the humidifier. TV is small and no English channels but that was okay. We saw icarly dubbed in Japanese and that was interesting.

The hotel front desk staff were useless. The first night we checked in at 1am and asked the front desk staff if any restaurants in the area were open. The front desk said only the family mart was open across the street; however, when we walked outside there were two bars/restaurants open directly next to the family mart! They also refused to help my husband and I call a restaurant to make a reservation for dinner - we don't speak Japanese fluently. The hotel was in a wonderful location in Ginza. About two blocks off the main strip so nice and quiet yet close by and within walking distance to all the restaurants and shopping that are the reasons to stay in Ginza.

However, I found the front desk staff were a big disappointment as they were not helpful, lack of TCAT limo bus schedule knowledge and at time, they pretended not to attend to our questions. I was not the only guest who feel it because I booked 3 rooms and 2 of my friends who stay at La Soeur felt the same. We still like Hotel Monterey but will go back to La Soeur instead on Ginza because the staff there are friendly and knowledge. I hope this feedback help Ginza staff to change their attitude.

The Monterey is good value for money and it is a reasonably priced hotel. Booking directly through the hotel's website is relatively easy.The rooms are comfortable but typical Japan small. A double for a couple should be more than adequate but if you're like us and travelling with a toddler and travel cot/crib we had to book a twin because it is slightly larger than a double and you can't book a double with a child. Even so there's not much floor space left once the cot is up. Apparently cots/cribs are available from the hotel for infants but when the child is older than one the child is expected to sleep in the parent's bed or you bring your own cot. The beds are comfortable and the bathroom facilities are fine. Typical of most Japanese hotels they have had free wired internet in every room and now they have free WiFi in the rooms which is fast and easily connectible. There's the usual TV and minibar in the room.In Winter the air con is too warm and the room gets a little stuffy. Housekeeping can open the windows but the open window is extremely dangerous with kids.I should mention the cute complementary pyjamas. A nice touch but a bit tight for a big fella like me. :)The Monterey is conveniently located near Metro stations, restaurants and shopping. The heart of Ginza is only 5 minutes walk away. The neighbourhood, considering it has so many restaurants, is very quiet. It is a great part of Tokyo and is very convenient to the Tsukiji Fish Market.The service from the hotel staff ranges from extremely helpful to quite abrupt when they won't or can't do something for you. For example the famous Sukiyabashi Jiro restaurant requires reservations from foreigners be made by the hotel they are staying at. Jiro refuses all reservations from the Monterey. We wondered why the hotel staff refused to even attempt to try and make a booking and they offered no explanation. After asking at Jiro we were told that Jiro blames the hotel for not doing the right thing when a guest or guests were a no show at the restaurant. For the record you need to give Jiro about a months notice to make a reservation anyway. If you really want to go to Jiro stay at another hotel. Otherwise it is a good hotel in a good location for a reasonable price. We'll probably try somewhere else next time though.","Melbourne, Australia","Shane_in_Oz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",73,4.0

Small (after all, this is Tokyo!), plainly decorated, but very clean. Bed was comfortable and the room was very quiet. My biggest issue with the room was the ventilation system. This is an old building, so once the heat in the building goes on, there's no way to reduce the temperature, not with the thermostat in your room and not by opening a window. This issue was pretty noticeable as we were there on some unseasonably warm fall days.

There is no safe in the room, but the hotel has a safe at the reception. Japan is very safe anyway...The only complaint I have about the room is the bed - hard as a rock with hard as a rock pillows. Hotel has an overall French theme (there seems to be some sort of French cultural invasion happening in Japan with all the french bistros, restaurants and cafes).

The closest subway station Ginza itchome is one block away, but I recommend walking five blocks to the Ginza station where you take the subway to Roppongi, Shibuya, Ueno, Shinjuku, Asakusa, and Akihabara districts.Hotel rooms are air-conditioned and the room temperature is adjustable. The hotel also provides dry cleaning services, but it is expensive ( 570 yens for shirts; 820 yens for trousers).Hotel staff are helpful, but like most Japanese residents they speak minimal English. However, you will be able to communicate with the staff.Although there are numerous local Japanee television channels, the only international channel is BBC News. Also, you need to ask for a steam iron.Hotel checkout time is at 11:00 a.m. However, if you have a late flight out of Tokyo, you can leave your luggage at the front desk at no charge. The hotel staff will also call a taxi at your request, but note that dispatching a Taxi costs an extra 400 yens.Overall, I was pleased with the hotel service and its location. The hotel is a 15 minute walk to Tokyo Station and a 10 minute walk to the Tokyo Convention Center. There is a Starbucks close by, just ask the hotel staff.",portland,"gentleman66</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>portland</strong>",3,4.0

I find that it fits all my needs, Its very central to tourist spots and shopping, its got very comfy beds (many beds in Japan are hard I find) and its still very clean and chic, even though its been around for quite some years now. It is also very affordable for the money you pay. I've seen people write that its expensive but if you want a good hotel in the heart of Tokyo you'll have to pay the money for it or travel back.The Metro (Ginza-ichome station) is right next door to the hotel. Yurakucho Station (for JR pass holders) is around a kilometre away walking back towards the main street. There are also 3 convenience stores surrounding it as well. We often went down there for snacks/late night food(they are all 24hr) very convenient.So in conclusion, unless you have super high expectations of a hotel and its amenities, this is a quaint hotel that will make you happy.

Had a room facing the back of another office block and so had to keep curtains shut all day and night! The room was clean, with wooden floors, fridge, hairdryer, TV an air con.

The room is the tiniest that we stayed in our whole 3 weeks in Japan and the pillows were awful. Like sleeping on a bag full of cement pebbles and when I asked for different pillows, I was straight up told no. The Hotel Monterey group are amazing at stocking your rooms with everything you need - pj's, toothbrush and toothpaste, shaving razor and gel, combs/brushes, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, earbuds, the list goes on so that was a plus. The TV remotes are all in Kanji and the other hotels provide an English guide on how to use them but not this one. When I called reception to ask how to put English subtitles on and how to use the remote in general, I was told no again. I thought that our non-smoking room still smelt a bit smoky too but not enough to complain.Look, the Hotel Monterey group of hotels are lovely, so the rooms are clean, the bathrooms are gorgeous and they all seem to be fairly well priced if you want something a bit fancier, but I'll be looking for somewhere else to stay in Tokyo when I visit again.","Brisbane, Australia","Jade A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",8,3.0

We chose the hotel mainly because we wanted to catch the Tsujiki Fish Market auction and no trains would be running that early in the morning; 10-15 walk to the market worked out perfectly and allowed us to go according to plan.

Compared to other hotels in Tokyo, Hotel Monterey Ginza is also fairly decent value. As is normal in Japan, cleanliness of the rooms is top notch and you're even provided with comfortable pajamas. One other great plus is the free wifi throughout the hotel.However, the rooms are incredibly tiny. My room had barely enough space between the (twin size) bed and the wall to get to the miniature desk. This was fine for one person who didn't spend much time in the hotel but would have been a lot more challenging for a couple. We also had one somewhat confusing service experience (which may have been due to a mis-communication despite the generally good levels of English). When we asked the hotel to help us make a dinner reservation (for a restaurant that later turned out to be literally next door), they flat out refused to do so (but did offer the use of the phone when I started doing it myself).

The bathroom has very little shelf space to place your personal items, but we managed ok since we have hanging toiletry travel kits.

We chose this hotel for the Ginza location. Unfortunately our stay coincided with Japan's Golden Week vacation period so hotel rooms at reasonable prices were impossible to find. However the Monterey Ginza was priced substantially below what we normally pay in the Ginza area (10K less Yen). And for this trip the price difference was greater.The price is great but the twin room size of 200 square feet is limiting. Prior to this the smallest Tokyo hotel room we occupied was 275 square feet. What a difference!

The location is excellent especially for those who like shopping. Restaurants are in abundance including many in the department stores and office buildings.

Lots of amenities (toiletries, pyjamas, slippers, newspapers) which is nice. Three things that should be mentioned are: 1, the room is not functional at all. No space to put clothes (a tiny tiny wardrobe to hang clothes, no drawers for putting clothes), the entrance hall is big but I wish they'd use that space to put a bigger and more functional wardrobe or to increase the main room size. 2, the drain didn't work very well--after I took a bath the drain back-washed so the bathroom was flooded!

Though travelling alone, I had a basic double room which was very comfortable, clean and smart. The staff were helpful at the front desk.

In terms of nightlife, Ginza isn't the best choice, because if you're out and about in Shibuya or Shinjuku for example and miss the last train...you're ""stranded"" quite far from your hotel, you'll have to take a relatively expensive taxi to get home.Annoyingly, I had some trouble sleeping (on several nights actually), but it might've been just me, not the hotel. The hotel itself is no-frills type of place, you won't find a huge fitness center or a swimming pool here.

Love the location, Ginza is great for both shopping and restaurants. A tip - the best restaurants are on the small side streets, not the main strips. This hotel is next to Ginaze-Itchome metro station, and is only 5-10 minute walk from Ginza metro station, which has direct links to some of the most interesting areas in Tokyo - Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ueno, Roppongi, etc. In my opinion this makes Ginza a good base for exploring Tokyo. Also the hotel is walking distance (about 15 - 20 minutes) to the Tsukiji Fish Market (a must see) and Tokyo Station (for Shinkansen trains to Kyoto, Osaka, etc). The rooms are very small but this is standard for Tokyo. The staff are helpful. There used to be free internet in the lobby but this has been replaced with a coin-operated internet computer.One major complaint - the rooms are small and get hot, but on my last visit the air conditioning was not working properly. We were told by the front desk that it was controlled by them, but when we asked them to turn the air-con up they said that they couldn't because this would cause all the other rooms to become cold. Was a bit suprised to find that rooms don't have individual climate control/air-con, have not had this problem in any other hotels in Japan. Not sure if this was a one-off problem or if this is a general problem with this hotel, but would definitely not stay here in summer if this was not fixed.","Sydney, Australia","SeeingIsBelieving007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",82,4.0

Not spacious - not a $400 western hotel - but the space is well-planned and that's totally fine with me. It's not located for maximum party times - this is not a hostel near Roppongi for the foreigner kids, and it's not in Shinjuku or catering to Western tourists. It does cater to Japanese and seems to have a pretty reliable clientele, and work on that basis. Staff usually speak passable English but do need to occassionally find a colleague to speak with you.

We didn't have breakfast or any meal included so I can't provide an opinion on that, but my guess is the restaurant was good from what I heard from other guests.There are internet facilities free of charge in the reception area, which was great for us since our cell phones didn't work while we were there.We spent a night away at the Hakone National Park and we couldn't wait to go back to the Monterey Ginza, we ended up calling it ""home"", because that is exactly what it felt like.All in all, it was a great experience and very affordable, I would truly recommend it to anyone.Virginia","London, United Kingdom","vdlc2019</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",8,5.0

I've stayed at the Monterey in Sapporo and in Sendai (both great experiences) and the Ginza Monterey simple doesn't compare. Rooms are small and business-hotel-like (in the cramped Japanese sense) and I had a double. Dull best describes the room. I reserved non-smoking and got a smoking room. The TV had BBC World but every time I hit the sub button for English it reverted to Japanese within a minute. And I was requested to pay the equivalent of $500 U.S. upfront (without even seeing my room) as 'policy of the hotel', despite the fact that I have both a permanent Japanese address and solid Japanese ability. A credit card imprint was not enough, I was billed the moment I signed in. This is the only hotel to ever request that of me in Japan and I've lived here for 11 years. Basically, the hotel needs to be renovated. It was probably a much nicer place in the 1970s. The hotel is convenient for Ginza shopping, but there are much better hotels available at roughly the same cost.","Sapporo, Japan","xClark-Griswoldx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sapporo, Japan</strong>",89,2.0

It's central location makes it a gem, not to mention the reasonable price. From the Ginza Itchome metro, take exit 11 and turn right. It's just two short blocks from there (1 minute walk). Hotel staff were hospitable and helpful. As per other reviews, don't take the breakfast; it's not worth $20. Try the McDonald's or Starbuck's, both a minute or two away by foot.The room itself is simple yet comfortable and ultraclean. I asked for a quiet room and found myself on the 12th floor, far above any of the minor traffic noise below; it's a very quiet area in any event. But a mere five minutes away and you are on Ginza Dori, the Oxford Street or Park Aveneue of Tokyo. Connections from the nearby Ginza metro (exit 13 is most convenient to hotel) are excellent. Overall, I would stay here again without hesitation. A very comfortable, clean and quiet hotel.","Shanghai, China","miccodxb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai, China</strong>",39,4.0

In a quiet street just off the Ginza and literally meters to the subway or within a five minute walk to a major station (saves more time-consuming changing), this hotel had good local shops nearby and it was very easy to get taxis. It's not flash, but neither is it basic - it is a tourist class hotel. The bathroom was good for a hotel of this class. The internet access is very good, but if you bring your own LAN cable you'll get connected a lot faster (they loan them from reception). Our only complaints were that the breakfast wasn't good (Monterey breakfasts are very average), and there was only one light at one side for our double bed (which had to be pulled out from the wall). There was limited English spoken, so patience was needed. I'd highly recommend this hotel as a base for Tokyo.","London, United Kingdom","Forever_a_Traveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",4,3.0

The bathroom (replete with a bidet--which you could choose to utilize or not) was immaculate, and I really appreciated that the comforter was zipped into this removable sheet that could be washed with every new guest (no more fear of touching the comforter). I guess I wasn't too crazy about just two things: The overlight was a bit too fluorescent for my taste, and the room had a lot of hard, uncomfortable furniture that didn't exactly invite you to just lounge after a tiring day shopping in Ginza. Please be advised that this hotel does not offer room service, which you probably won't need anyway, considering all the great eats around the area. The location is great. With one subway line, the Ginza It-chome, just a minute's walk away, and the main Ginza line about a 7-9 minute walk away, it was very convenient. I found that walking to the Ginza line directly allowed you to link up to the other arteries of the subway system easier, not to mention save you a bit of cash by avoiding numerous transfers.

Strong retro styled building that gives a business ‘boutique hotel’ feel (the lifts have sliding block indicator that actually click over each floor with a sound). Compact room size that offer adequate floor area for bags. Good size bath room for Japanese standards. No problem in returning for my next stay. Breakfast is expensive at the hotel, as expected in all Japanese hotels. More reasonable if you go for the local coffee shop - big mug of blended coffee at Y160. Service is attentive and staff spoke reasonable English. Check in / out time – disappointingly restrictive! Earliest check in time 3 PM and latest check out time by 11 AM with extra hour charge at Y1000. This is a ‘hard rule’ and typical of Japan hotels, even though there may be rooms available. Pretty stupid rules; Japan Travel Bureau please take note.Facilities - a compact hotel with few extra services. There is a large TV in the room with just one English Channel (BBC); access via a language selection that did not work well as the selected language kept reverting back to Japanese after some minutes. Internet access was free but you need to obtain a cable from the Reception (this practice is common in most Japan hotels). Coffee and tea are also supplied free of charge but the facilities are hidden away that you need to play hide and seek in finding them.Shakesp380, Sydney Australia","Singapore, Singapore","dragonback1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",12,4.0

At my dismay when checking in, the poor English speaking receptionist said the rooms were 2 people only, therefore I had to shell out for a single room for the 3rd person.The hotel welcoming area was cramped, crowded, although clearly well furnished given its 'new hotel' status. The restaurant was strictly of the businessman clientel, with prices to match. The rooms were small and snuggly (if you like that sort of thing), at least half the size of the average American hotel room. The bathroom included a nifty electronic 'spa' toilet and bidet, shame it didn't work properly, thankfully the manual chain did. Even the Lipton tea in the room is only 'accessible' via a fee.Clean hotel, pricey, well furnished, glossy, small, boutique style in a good location for the '$10 for a coffee' brigade in Ginza, Kanto.
