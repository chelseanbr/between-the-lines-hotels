A front-desk clerk, Lauren, snapped at me on the phone. Note that I am even a HHonors Gold member. . ..At the front desk, I heard that another Hawaii resident got waived for the resort fee (the amenities are closed anyway due to the virus situation) so I asked for the same thing. The manager agreed to waive the fee for this stay only. Because I never used any of the amenities and for being a Hawaii resident, I asked for adjustment of the resort fee to my stay 7 days ago. The manager declined my request. So I headed to my room. The room does not even have an ocean view, even though I am a Gold member. But due to reluctance to bother the staff again, I did not ask to change room. Instead, I unpacked and started a basic cleaning and disinfected the surface areas as I routinely do. Then, I noticed the glass shower door was covered all by streaks of watermarks, looking like it had not been cleaned. The cleaning staff came for a look and said it should not be like that and he would return and handle it. Since I already went over the floor with the disinfecting wipes, I was reluctant to let people in and mess up again. So I told the front desk that I could wipe it myself, given that it is just a one-night stay, but asked again for waiver for the resort fee from last week’s bill. After an hour, I checked again, which was when Lauren started her craziness. She said either the cleaning staff would clean the door or I need to change room. I was saying even that was inconvenience for me since I already unpacked and disinfected the area. But Laurent cut me off and yelled : “No, it is not inconvenience”, “No, there will not be any compensation”, “It was only just A water spot” (that was not true; it was not one water spot; the whole glass door had streaks of watermarks, or calcification of something, or soap scum), “We provided a solution and YOU would not take it”, ……. She has a higher voice and obviously a language advantage over me, an immigrant (she talked much faster than me in the least). The result was that I never got to finish my sentence and was choked effectively. And that set the miserable tone for my stay. Later the cleaning staff came but were not able to remove those calcification marks on the glass door– another first-time finding for me, since I never saw glass shower doors with stains that do not come off after cleaning in other hotels.Cutting people short is impolite even for everyday conversation and Lauren was doing that to a HHonors Gold member paying for the stay. It IS INCONVENIENCE for guests to check in and find that cleaning was not done properly. When I check in, I expect everything taken care of. Lauren single-handedly ruined my stay. The hotel adjusted for the resort fee, but they did not lose anything since I should have been given a lower Kamaaina rate for both stays. The hotel staff just acted as if they did not see my Hawaii ID.",,waahi1200,1,1.0

I feel guilty asking about my points and days that don't show on my account.

Things started off great with a bottle of water and a cookie for all 6 of us. Since I reserved a room for 6 people, I expected the room to be ready for 6 people. The sofa bed had no linens and there was only 1 tiny bottle of shampoo for all of us. After 3 calls to the front desk we finally got all of the sheets, pillows, blankets and shower products that we needed for a traveling family of 6. Next morning, only 2 get the complimentary ‘continental’ breakfast. Doesn’t matter that my reservation was for my husband and I, and 4 of our kids. So, only the small selection of muffins and bread to make toast and bananas. All of the hot stuff around the perimeter is extra. The omelette bar, potatoes, bacon, etc is an extra charge. By the time all of us ate a hot breakfast My room cost me almost another $100. Add in another $40 for parking and my “bargain” $325 room ended up costing me $475.

That room seemed much bigger than the typical rooms from the pictures. We had a handicap accessible room and the shower sucked! Water was everywhere every time someone showered.

Sadly the front desk staff was quite underwhelming. There was no Hawaiian ambience in the lobby sadly. With the construction right next-door starting at 7 AM and the very loud elevators double ring every time the doors open, I honestly couldn’t wait to get out of the very small room. A phone at the little desk would be helpful, the coffee maker was a nice touch as was the little fridge. The Internet went off and on all day every day for the 9 days I was there. I’ve been very fortunate to stay at Marriotts, Hyatts but even when I stayed at less expensive resorts all over the world I have never encountered such uncomfortable pool lounge chairs, the two bars under the chair would stab your neck area and back, one man stood up and he had the imprint of the bar across his back. They did have a pool bar serving drinks so that was an added bonus but not able to order food from there which was too bad. The general manager who was serving that day was very nice. The location was good being close to the international marketplace and just a 2 to 3 block walk to the beach.

I stayed before but it was still the old Ohana West. We stayed for 3 nights in February 2020. We have Diamond status and booked using points. We checked the available rooms online a day before and also before going to the hotel. A 1 bedroom suite was available on their app on the date of check in so we quickly locked that in. We were surprised that the suite was available on points. It was a big corner room on a high floor. We liked how spacious it was. The only problem we have (which is true of almost all hotels) is the lack of lighting. The room was too dark after sunset even with all the floor lamps on. We also got free breakfast during our stay due to Hilton status. The selection was pretty much the same everyday. So if you’re staying a week, and eating breakfast on status daily then it can get old. The hotel was renovated a few years ago when it became a Hilton so things look new for now. The staff were friendly.The location is convenient. Its close to bus stops, restaurants, shopping. The International Market Place is across and then the Royal Hawaiian Center is the street across that. Its not beach front but I don’t think that’s a deal breaker. The beach is about a block or 2 away. There is construction across the street. I didn’t think it was too noisy but I’m sure the experience is different for those whose room is close to the noise.

Kerry was awesome! She was kind and professional and happily welcomed me back from my August visit. It was nice to feel like a “regular” and was confident I’d get a comfortable and clean room. I knew I wasn’t going to be spending too much time in the room, but of course it’s always nice to walk in to a newly renovated & spotless hotel room. There was enough space for two double beds with plenty of moving room and a nice seating area, mini fridge, keurig and microwave. We didn’t spend too much time on the balcony, but it was nice to catch a glimpse of the ocean over the international market place- and even could see the beginning of the sunset! It was super easy to walk across the street to the international market place and cut thru to Other shops and to Waikiki beach. Also, having The convenience of a food/small grocery store for necessary amenities in the lobby was ideal. The bell desk and valet guys were all great!

I suppose it's my fault for having decent expectations for a Hilton establishment.First, there were ants in the room, an infestation that the hotel did not take seriously. Someone investigated during the day, found the ants even behind the bed (!) and just sprayed some supposedly ""odourless"" chemicals and asked us to check when we returned to see if there were any left. Concerned, I asked to change rooms, but I was told the hotel had oversold so no rooms were available. Fine, we crossed our fingers.It was NYE so we did not return until past midnight and lo and behold the ants had climbed onto our luggages. The room number is 1766, please for your own sake avoid this room, the chance they will actually clear the infestation (which was promised to me would happen) is next to 0%. I suspect this for two reasons: 1) the housekeeping manager Jon told me they would take the room out of circulation and that he would send me an email that day to keep me updated on the progress - hasn't happened, and 2) when I briefly went back into the room to look for sunglasses I thought I left in the room, I found the room had been cleaned for the next guest, sheets changed and everything. Maybe if the hotel was less overbooked, they would actually fix the problem... but who knows?Anyway, here I am pinching/killing these fast moving ants on our luggages at 3am on the first day of 2020. Thankfully, because it was so late, we were able to move to a room vacant due to a no show - so we could at least sleep a few hours in peace.Second, the attitude of the guest services manager Alana Drew was horrendous to me, as she did not seem to empathize at all with this inhumane situation, making it sound like I should be grateful for getting some compensation (their first suggested compensation was 1 night's resort fee... laughable, in a depressing way). Though the compensation in the end was somewhat acceptable (unpleasantly I still had to pay the rate of the ant infested room), it felt like the staff (especially Alana) didn't think it was a big deal - which is mind boggling and caused me great frustration. Maybe it's just me, other people might be cool with sleeping in a room with an ant army.Side note, when I came down to the concierge at 3am to get our room changed, I overheard someone asking the concierge how many stars the hotel had as they had discovered cockroaches in their room.I booked this hotel because of the great reviews here, and it's possible that in fair weather (aka no problems with the room, etc.), this hotel would match those expectations. My advice is to either hope for good luck, or stay away.","Toronto, Canada","lillyc965</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",0,1.0

The rooms were clean and well maintained with nice amenities such as a microwave, small fridge and a tea kettle (nice bonus for me as I am a tea drinker).

The bed was comfortable and the room was small but quite good, TV was good and overall was good value. The lady who cleaned the room was very friendly and did a great job, Nolan at the concierge was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. I was disappointed that the photos of the bathroom on their website didn’t match the room, I had a tub with a shower but the picture showed a walk in shower and also showed a balcony. I was offered a room without a balcony and I accept that I chose a lower floor room but the pictures on the website clearly showed a balcony. The staff member was very accommodating and was able to find another room for me so that wasn’t an issue. I do believe the hotel should stipulate if the room has a tub/shower combination as it wasn’t easy to step into the bath. The bathroom was very clean and no complaints but please have the correct information for the room type. The resort fee is a money grab, they offer sunscreen, yoga, a discount book for the International Market and a tea kettle and coffee maker in the room. A tea kettle should be standard, I could have purchased one for a lot cheaper than the resort fee and also the same with sunscreen. The discount book wasn’t much value. I know most of the Waikiki hotels charge this fee but it is a total rip off.no choice.

Installing a light in this niche would be great.2. there are 2 fitness room. one for cardio, the other for weights. Why these are not connected baffles the mind. And the doors are accessed with your room key card too, so one can't just go out from one and into the other easily. Duh !

The staff who checked us in at the front desk Suzette was very nice and was able to check us in before check in time.The Hotel staff are really friendly and especially Nolan and Wade in front of the hotel. But the staff in general are helpful and nothing is too much for them.Hotel location is ideal, right across the road from the International Market place and only a block from the beach. There are plenty of places to eat nearby. There is a Holoholo convenient store underneath the hotel, we found they were bit expensive compare to the ABC store right across the road from Holoholo. For example Holoholo charging 89 cents for a banana and ABC I paid 69cents. This hotel provides free internet and also sun block by the pool, which I thought is a nice touch, it’s the little things that counts that make this hotel nice place to stay. Our room had 1 King bed and a sofa bed, room was a nice size with plenty of room and we had a balcony, which was really great to have our morning breakfast sitting in our private balcony and people watching as we opted for a City view room.Pool is bit on the small size but there are plenty of chairs to sit on and they also have shade if you prefer to stay out of the sun. Hotel provides beach towels. This hotel is only 5-8 minute walk to the Waikiki Beach.We took an UBER from the International Airport and it we paid USD27 one way, you can also take transfer from the airport which will cost you USD26 return but they make stops to drop guest off to hotels along the way.There is a Kona Coffee shop across the road, it was really nice coffee and pastries. For example for a coffee and a pastry we paid USD12, which is on average for Waikiki. Food in general is bit on the expensive side in Waikiki.We went to a place called the Steak Shack, and you can get a steak meal for USD8.95, in this meal includes salad and rice. Which is great value, and I recommend you go to Steak Shack, which is near Outrigger Reef Hotel and watch the sunset it is beautiful.We would definitely stay at this hotel again as the location is ideal and staff are nice and rooms are comfortable.","Sydney, Australia","Rav S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",5,4.0

By the time we checked out there was over 600 in Debited charges that needed to be refunded. These took over a week to come back onto the card, so being a debit card it was funds i did not have.

The pool area is small and could be maintained better. The pool bar is alright, not open early enough and the selection is small with higher prices.The rooms were kept very clean, however most of the time our rooms weren't cleaned until far afternoon so we had to stay out well after breakfast time. Not a huge deal though. There are no extra little designs or surprises after the rooms are cleaned even with a tip, however they clean very well so no complaints there.They offer complimentary water and coffee on most days in the lobby which was a great touch, just not vey consistent day to day. The restaurant TR fire grill that is attached is absolutely amazing. The store that is also attached has very friendly staff and is great for when you are to tired to walk across the street (literally across) to an ABC ;) haWhat we loved most about this hotel is the location.. its in the heart of all stores, food places as well as the Waikiki beach!

Kerry T. at the front desk was amazing! She was kind & helpful & made an effort to ensure our stay was relaxing & easy. You could tell she genuinely cared. The front desk was pretty hectic with people all around- both when we arrived & departed- it is obviously very popular to stay here...but Kerry (& all of the front desk agents) remained calm & pleasant, no matter how many people where lined up. I saw Kerry escort the other guests to show them where to go to find the elevator or a bellman and she was even helping a man figure out how to work the ATM bc he only spoke German & needed help. I was truly impressed by the level of hands-on service. I stay in Waikiki a lot for business and pleasure and it was so nice to arrive to a clean and modern looking hotel after a long day.My husband and i were very pleasantly surprised by the nice clean modern/newly renovated condition of the room! We had a standard king room with a view of the International marketplace-but it wasn't too loud and you couldn't really hear too much hustle and bustle once the sliding door was closed and the AC was on. It was in a perfect location to walk everywhere we wanted: We could cut thru the marketplace to get to Kalakaua street and the beach super easily. It was nice to not be on the main strip so we could be a little off the beaten path, but not too far. We could walk to all of our favorite restaurants in less than 5-10 mins. *Make sure you talk with the concierge (yes there's a nice concierge desk here!) and/or the front desk agents to get accurate tips on walking distances to places, food options and other attractions. Ideally, These people are here to help you have the best trip to oahu!Other notes: The bath amenities were nice mini Neutrogena products and there was even a hot water kettle and a single cup Keurig machine (with pods supplied, but powder creamer only- you can get cream in the shop in the lobby). There's also complementary coffee set up in the lobby in the morning, which was a huge plus! Attached to the lobby is a Holo Holo (general store, like an ABC) with a full service coffee bar and regular bar (open late with beer on tap!!)- also equipped with fresh pastries in the morning. There is nice looking restaurant connected to the lobby, the Fire Grill,which we didn't have time to eat at, but looked very trendy and offered a nice looking breakfast, lunch and dinner!I feel like if you are prepared to not be staying literally in the beach and know that you will not have an ocean view, you will be pleasantly surprised by this hotel and location. Waikiki is crowded all day and night, so if you come with a go-with-the-flow attitude, your experience will be enjoyable. Be prepared to walk a lot, wait in some lines, and experience a one of the most beautiful (yet packed) beaches in the world. You have to be ready for a lot of people around, but there's so much to see and enjoy- beauty & food & culture- just be kind and grateful to the hardworking local people there and you will feel the Aloha spirit!**It is important to get accurate directions on how to pull into / checkin to the valet (there is no public parking for this hotel- so u must be prepared for the valet charge)- the valet /checkin location is on a one-way street, so make sure you are arriving on the correct road (which is not the same street as the address listed online)- it is called Walina Street!

It was a disaster. The room backed onto the lift shaft with 3 lifts clunking and clanging every time they moved (which is pretty much all the time in a busy hotel!). We complained, and after a pretty long negotiation, we were moved to a quieter room and then moved again the following night so we could actually have the bedding configuration we paid for. To be fair, the Hilton didn’t charge us for the first night, which is why we haven’t rated the hotel “terrible”, but we paid a lot of money for our room and we just wanted what we paid for. It did ruin the first part of our long awaited 3 day holiday. The hotel is in a good location, and the room we were transferred to was pleasant and very comfortable, but you need to be prepared for it being very busy (we often had to wait a long time for lifts) and it’s not a quiet, classy hotel - it’s noisy and an old apartment building converted and refurbished into a Hilton. Also, avoid any room ending in 50 (eg 1850, 750 etc) - these back onto the lift shaft and, in our opinion, shouldn’t be sold as “standard” rooms - the Hilton should be honest with customers and disclose that they are noisy and either sell them as “budget” rooms or change them into a store room until they can install some more modern, quieter building services, which make those rooms inhabitable.

The rooms were nice & clean and had a great balcony. The staff were nice as well. Not much of a view from the hotel but there are very few hotels right on the beach so we decided to save a few bucks as it was 3 blocks from the beach. It was across the street from the Mall which had some nice quick places to eat. There is so much to see in the area, both right outside the hotel as well as around it. The trolley went by the hotel and stopped 1 block away. The area was, in my opinion, very safe. The pool area had a nice bar and was busy but not crowded. The market downstairs was a bit pricey compared to nearby markets. The market downstairs had food, seating areas and snacks to bring to the room which we used for breakfast.Bottom line, this is not a resort. There are nicer, true resorts in Waikiki if you want to spend more. If you are going just for the beach and beach views, this may not be the hotel for you.

The service we received from the very start of our stay until the end was consistently fantastic.What a fantastic location, so central to everything on Waikiki. Nothing seemed like more than a 10 minute walk away. The beach is a block from the hotel, and there are many restaurants and shops nearby to choose from. There is also a Starbucks Reserve store a mere block away- they have amazing service and we went there daily.We booked a city view room and got a room on the 4th floor facing the International Market mall. Even though we were facing the very busy street, we didn't hear any street noise from inside our room, so we slept soundly. The room was a good enough size for us and our luggage to stay for the week, and the bathroom vanity was quite large. There is a mini-fridge that works well, a Keurig coffee machine, and a kettle. A safe is also provided. There was a small balcony that fit a little table and 2 chairs, nice to have coffee there in the mornings. The room was clean, and was a comfortable place to recharge. Tina did a great job cleaning our room daily.One thing to note- there is construction going on across Walina street that can be very loud and starts early, so I would request a room not facing that direction if possible.We are Diamond members so the breakfast buffet was included. A very nice assortment to choose from: bacon, sausages, scrambled eggs, potatoes, rice, oatmeal, cereal, fruit, yogurt, juices, and a variety of pastries. They also did 'cook to order' omelettes and eggs as well, and were delicious.The only thing that was a pain was parking here is valet only, and we like being able to just jump in the car and leave when we want. So we avoided the valet for the first few days by parking on the street, we would just have to remember to plug the meter every two hours. But one night we just couldn't find street parking so begrudgingly went to the valet for $42/day. We asked about the waits in the morning, because it always appeared to be utter chaos. They said they could have us on the Express list for a specific time, and they would have it in 10-15 minutes. It wasn't the ""jump in and go"" that we like, but it wasn't as bad as it appeared. And the valets were all so friendly, polite, and always smiling. And alot if them working which helps. But there really needs to be a ""self park"" option for guests.We had a late flight out, and the HGI was able to give us a later checkout for 2pm, and also gave us a courtesy room for 45 minutes for whenever we needed to shower and change before our flight, which was a nice gesture. The bellboys were able to keep our luggage is a secure area before our flight as well, so it didn't have to sit in our car.Overall, this was a fantastic stay at the HGI Waikiki Beach.

(Though, around 2011-2012, I stopped patronizing HGIs because those awful adjustable beds were so uncomfortable.)This property was the former Ohana Waikiki West Hotel, which originally opened in 1970, and remained stuck in the 1970’s throughout its lifespan. I remember visiting the Ohana in the early aughts as a possible place to stay, but the property was severely outdated. The Ohana closed in 2015 and re-opened in mid-2016 as an HGI.Check-in: Kudos to Kerry at the Front Desk. She did an excellent job in making me aware of the room location, potential noise from the next-door construction site, views (partial ocean or city), etc. We had an extended conversation (because I can be pedantic about my room) and she placed me in a perfect location. Thank you, Kerry.Room: I had a king suite, but I’m not divulging the room number. If I mention it, everyone will want it. :-) For an HGI suite, this was probably the best I’ve had in 10-plus years. Yes, every HGI is different in regard to room layout and room location, but I don’t think I could have done better than this one. The suite I was originally assigned was occupied when I arrived and would not be available until early evening. After my discussion with Kerry, she placed me in a different suite – excellent choice. The bedroom was a good distance from the living space; the living space was small and quaint but had enough room for me. The living space had the usual uncomfortable HGI couch, a coffee table, and another small table and two chairs. On the small table was the Keurig coffee maker and a tea kettle. (I didn’t have to request a tea kettle – yeah!) The TV sat on top of a cabinet and the cabinet contained a refrigerator which chilled items sufficiently, a microwave, small storage, and the large flat screen, which was sized appropriately for this space. The bathroom had a single sink, toilet, and shower (no tub, but a tub is never a requirement for me). The bedroom had the obligatory king bed, which was OK. I like a firm mattress and this one wasn’t that firm. The bedroom had a desk(!) with a chair, and another lounge chair. Quite remarkably, the bedroom (at the desk and night stands) had sufficient electrical outlets for the phone, iPad, and computers – a huge win for me. Some reviewers have complained about storage, which is, indeed, limited. The tall closet armoire in the bedroom had only two drawers. However, in this particular suite, there was another tall closet armoire in the entry hallway. Even then, if you’re a family of 2+, you’ll likely have to use your luggage for storage.I had a partial ocean view, but having an ocean view isn’t significant to me. The bonus, however, was the two balconies: the balcony off the bedroom had the partial view to the ocean and the other balcony had a view to the city and Diamond Head – great photo ops across various times of the day. On the bedroom balcony there was a table and chairs. If you’re into sunbathing (I’m not) and you don’t need a pool, there was plenty of space on the balcony off the bedroom to accomplish that. At this time of year, the warm, fading light of the sunset was a great view from the bed. I was taking a nap and happened to wake up as the sun was setting and it was quite nice. A note about the partial view of the ocean: Even if you have a room that faces toward the water, your view will be obstructed by the neighboring buildings, so you’ll never have a pristine, unobstructed view of the ocean. This HGI hotel has 20 floors. One neighboring building which obscures the ocean view is taller than the HGI building.I can’t comment about their restaurant since I had all my meals off-site. I loved the Holoholo Cafe and Market right next door, which you could enter from the lobby. Expensive? Yes, but I’m visiting, and it is Waikiki. The good news is that the grab and go fresh fruit was great on this visit and none of it was spoiled or past its expiration date. The papaya, mango, and pineapple were outstanding. I also found some rosemary/olive oil macadamia nuts – wonderful.Service: This was one of those visits where everything worked. Front Desk, Concierge, housekeeping, and even (what a surprise) valet parking – they were all fantastic. Of course, Kerry at the Front Desk was superb - friendly, knowledgeable, very helpful, and courteous. Even when I saw her helping others, she was always friendly and working hard to accommodate a guest. Housekeeping did a fine job of refreshing the room and honoring a specific time of day (thank you). The Concierge on the second day was quite helpful.Parking: Valet parking, which is usually my sore point at a hotel, was great. There’s the usual juggling of cars in a limited space, but my car was retrieved in a timely manner upon each request and all the parking attendants (except one, who’s name I can’t remember) were friendly, smiled, and had a positive attitude. I liked the fact that, upon my initial arrival, they inspected the rental car for dings, dents, scratches, etc. Good idea and should avoid the proverbial “Valet parking dented my car.” I think I paid $42/day. Expensive? It’s all relative (and it is Waikiki where parking and space is tight). It’s much worse in other cities – Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York come to mind.Location: It’s in Waikiki so there’s the noise, people, traffic, etc. You have to accept that the hotel is located in a densely populated area of Waikiki. It’s directly across from the updated and chic International Market Place (which was a dreary and sad place years ago) and a quick walk over to Kalakaua Ave. for the upscale stores. From the hotel, everything you could possibly want to do in Waikiki is walkable. Food? Well, it’s all tourist food in Waikiki. Most of it is passable; some of it is pretty bad. One day, a neighboring hotel was having some sort of party/get-together and the music was very loud. I could hear the music at the elevators, but surprisingly, it never made it to my wonderfully isolated room. :-) The hotel is within walking distance to the beach. It’s not right on the beach, but it’s a 5 minute walk to the beach.The hotel is 3 years past its renovation. I hope they maintain the rooms as well as the level of service I experienced on this visit. It’s a tourist hotel and no telling what it will look like in another year or two or three. Before that happens, though, I’ll have to return. :-)","San Francisco, California","Apollo P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",154,5.0

Most all the hotels will charge this even if they just have only a pool and even if you don’t use it! We didn’t rent a car but parking is another 40/day here.

The kitchen service/ breakfast is provided by Fire Grill (a place likely improved if it did actually catch fire) but the Hilton itself is good enough. The bellhop/ valet staff are excellent along with housekeeping however the check-in desk staff are a more ‘Aloha’ than they are ‘helpful’. 50/50 I guess. Ultimately the rooms are basic and clean with comfortable beds, basic appliances and a combined shower/ toilet room with the sink near the door (oddly).The biggest win for this hotel is the air conditioning. We set the A/C for max upon our arrival and 10 minutes later we were chipping icicles off the nightstands. Seriously, if all you need is 4 walls and a roof with an air temp of -10C, you’ve found the right place.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","ChrisG7328</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",16,3.0

There are plenty of supermarkets, restaurants, and shoppings within a fifteen minutes walking block. There is a Japanese supermarket right across the street, and the hotel's convenient store is actually cheaper than the ABC store across the street. The service was also very good and I like the texting system. I am able to ask for a few items through texting the wonderful staffs at the hotel. However, the room, despite a modern decor, is really on the small side. The room really cannot accommodate more than two people comfortably. There is no sofa area because there is no room to put any additional furniture. The bathroom is okay and I like the huge walk-in shower. The premium/high-speed WIFI works very well. For gold and diamond members, they are free, and for other folks, it costs $5 extra, which is well worth it. I also want to post a warning about the elevator situation. Despite having 20 floors and four elevators, the wait time was still very long. I don't understand it. Finally, there is a really ridiculous resort fee. I am really going to write my congressmen and women because this kind of fee is outrageous. Come on this is not Hilton Hawaiian Village. It is just Hilton Garden Inn and it is no resort. The fee includes 2 Hawaiian juices at the bar (not even canned drinks pre-placed in the fridge, basic WIFI access, complimentary local, 1-800, and domestic long distance calls, complimentary sunscreen and after sun lotion, in room coffee, in room hot pot [that is definitely for Asian guests, who drink tea, and I call it a PLUS] with tea, daily morning yoga classes, and a discount book for International Marketplace, which is across the street.

It's opposite many stores and very close to several restaurants as well as walking distance to the famous Waikiki beach, so really does put you in the heart of it all. For location I'd definitely give 5* without a doubt, but especially having Island hopped and directly comparing the Hilton to some other less reputable hotels, it felt a bit sterile. We went for a basic room which we were allocated pretty high up, so had no issues here. The balconies are quite small and not really usable in my opinion, and the room sizes are not too generous, but not extremely cramped either. The beds were super comfy and I will give credit to Hilton for giving us a freebie box of Hawaii Cookie Company treats as it was our honeymoon! That being said, if they knew it was our honeymoon you'd perhaps expect that when we checked in the receptionist would mention something (as we'd experienced previously) - our check in wasn't bad but our host surely had no clue. It was a simple check in here are your keys, now next customer please situation. The pool isn't too large, but it does get a good amount of sun and makes a nice area. It's just a shame there's no food service around this area, particularly given signs showing no outside food is allowed - we could really have made an afternoon of chilling here! Speaking of food, we thought one day to try the breakfast and it wasn't half bad... just perhaps not worth the price tag! There was a selection of the usual buffet breakfast options but I've been to other Hiltons and this would rank near the bottom relatively. Again the service and atmosphere just felt lifeless and uninviting. We decided for the remainder of our stay to dine elsewhere (which was super easy given the plethora of options literally across the street!)Now onto check out... we had a 10pm flight so checking out at 11am and leaving bags in the reception was our plan. However, in the past I'd heard of ""amenity rooms"" that can be booked for 1 hour slots that allow you to have a quick shower before a long flight so at asking at reception the night before check out were firmly told was not available as the hotel was fully booked. We decided our luck to ask again at checkout and the manager must have heard and confirmed there was space indeed, so booked us in. Returning to the hotel at 4pm the staff informed us this was impossible as the hotel was booked, so saying those dreadful words ""can we speak to your manager"" ended up in the manager confirming the space was available which clearly shocked the person we were speaking to. Whether it was lack of internal communication or just a misunderstanding, it really should not happen. We're super grateful that we were able to use the room given it's clearly subject to availability, but our booking was by no means chump change! Overall, our stay was pleasant where we didn't really have any issues. The hotel reception has a booking.com counter for excursion activities and we were fantastically suited to see some key things in Waikiki, e.g. Hanauma Bay and Diamond Head - more of which you can read at Bhik Adventures. I just felt that given the title of a Hilton there should have been more effort to make every guest feel super welcome in the land of Aloha, especially as it was so emphasised elsewhere. I'd still recommend this hotel, but purely on location and a no frills type of holiday. If you want uber luxury, perhaps look at the Sheraton on Waikiki beach - the infinity pool and other pools looked incredible! I'm sure the budget is too... but for a more reasonable place, you can't really go wrong here.","London, United Kingdom","thebhik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",52,3.0

It is small overall and doesn't get a lot of sun, but it was rarely too busy.Fitness Center: They do have two rooms of fitness, but for one of the largest Hilton Garden Inns, the gym should compare. It is relatively small overall. Random note, they didn't have any elliptical machines, just free weights, treadmills, and bikes.Rooms: Very nice modern upgraded rooms on the small side. Balconies are nice, but the street side can be very loud so keep that in mind.Parking: Parking in Waikiki is expensive and not always convenient, so the fact that this hotel is the same is comparable to the surrounding hotels. If you are not going to use a car the entire time think about the parking costs.Fees: A major plus to waive the resort fees for government customers (at least they told me sometimes).Overall, I would consider staying here again as a Hilton member, but would would look at at a couple of other Hilton's in Waikiki first depending on what I was interested in.","Denver, Colorado","JM038</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",17,4.0

Unfortunately they have instituted a resort fee (which gives me nothing I wouldn't already redeive) and I was able to get a rate at this hotel that did not charge a resort fee (HGI usually does), and included tax (or so I thought). The only thing I was concered with was the cost of the parking (valet only). There is no other parking lots in the vicinity (is mall parking accross the street) so I parked at the hotel. While I understand parking is a scarce and there will be a heafty fee, but $42 is a lot higher than other hotels in the area (I paid $20 at lot near Hilton (now $25). Outside of that my initial impression of the hotel was positive. HGI Waikiki Beach was an upgrade from other HGI's I have stayed at (I am not a big fan of HGI). The lobby area is much nicer than any other HGI I have stayed and the room was clean and updated. Better than most Hilton rooms (but unfortunately same hard HGI bed). My only complaint was the view. As a Diamond member I usually get upgraded to an ocean view, but understand many people book these rooms (West facing rooms don't really have great ocean views - blocked by other buildings) and have no problem not getting this room (I was only there for 1 night). But, at least I thought I would get view facing the opposite way of the water and facing the mountains. Instead I got one facing the side of the hotel and an alley way. I honestly didn't think there was such a view in Waikiki. But again, I was only there for 1 night so it wasn't that big of a deal (rather not get a view when I am alone and on business). The pool area was nice and you could get towels to take to the beach (just bring them back or you get charged). The wifi was better than most Hilton's so I was happy about that and the Diamond breakfast was by far the best breakfast I have had at a HGI (in the US). The only other issue I had was when checking out there was an issue with what I was being charged, but that got taken care of after I left. Would I stay here again? If I have a car, probably not. But if you don't have a car (which most don't) and can find value in the resort fee (most hotels charge this now) this is a nice place to stay in a very good location (2 to 3 blocks from the beach). One note, it is not well marked. I have been in this area a few times since the HGI Waikiki Beach opened and I didn't even know it was there.

It’s a stand alone hotel with a pool, pool bar, and cafe in the lobby. Nice, but nothing special. Near the International Market Place but a couple of blocks from the beach. My issue is that they charge a Resort Fee of $28 per room per night. The Hilton Garden Inn is not (repeat NOT) a resort in any way!! Hilton is praying on you for your vacation dollars while not offering anything resort-like in return. You’ll also pay $42 a day for parking. That’s more than you probably paid for a modest rental car per day. You are paying $70 on top of your room rate per day for a resort fee and parking. So factor that in to your planning if you decide to book at any of the Waikiki Hilton properties. The resort fees and parking are even higher at the other Waikiki Hilton’s. Are you a Hilton Honors member? Great, you get a fabulous two bottles of water at check-in. Really too much!! (not). Just an FYI, I complained to the Desk Clerk about the Resort Fee and he admitted there was really no reason for the Resort Fee and removed it from my bill !! So they (Hilton) know they are gouging their guests.

You need to ask the front desk staff for bus information. They have a great sheet that gives you the bus number & approximate time to destination for most of the sights & locations on the island. Ask for a room higher up because the street in front of the hotel is quite noisy at night. We paid for a partial ocean view that was just a few slivers of ocean, so think about this before requesting this type of room. We did like the sun angle because we could sit out on the balcony in the afternoon sun. We were celebrating our 60th wedding anniversary, so the front staff gave us one free buffet breakfast. It was good to have this experience because the breakfast was not what we usually eat, so we found other breakfast spots in the area that we enjoyed more. The service staff is friendly and helpful, which we appreciated. The room safe, micro & fridge are pluses I always look for. The free standing shower (not over a tub) was great! No messy shower curtain or slippery tub floor to deal with. One thing my husband missed was having a few drawers to put his clothes in as we were there for 7 nights. He also appreciated the Fitness Center--which is housed in two rooms--so look next door for free weights & other equipment besides the usual treadmill and elliptical. With all the taxes and $25 resort fee--our $240 a night room became $310 per night, but they did provide the correct amount with all the extras when I booked on line, so that was not a surprise. We did enjoy our stay--the elevators were numerous and fast, but the wifi was slow & the service kept dropping.

The last time I visited Hawaii, we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I was attending a conference this time, and the HHV was too far from the conference hotel. I booked this hotel based on price (much cheaper than conference hotel rate) and location to the conference hotel.The location of this hotel was great. It is literally right across from the International Market (so lots of food options), Starbucks is nearby, a Food pantry is across the street, and the hotel has a coffee bar in the lobby, it's own store, and its own restaurant. In terms of proximity to Waikiki Beach, it is a few blocks, but an easy walk. I packed a tote bag in our suitcase, so we packed up beach towels (provided by the hotel on floor 3), goggles, drinks, and headed to the beach. My boys are 11 & 13 so it was easy, and since I didn't need to return to the hotel for any naps, the proximity was a non-issue. The room wasn't huge, but it was nice. It had both a microwave and a fridge. Since I booked on price, we got the cheapest room with no view, so we faced other buildings. It had a balcony, but we did not use it. The room had a Keurig coffee maker in the room which was well stocked, so we really enjoyed this perk. The pool is located on the third floor, and it is small. Despite the size, my kids used it everyday. The sun shines on the pool (so it has a good sun deck), and there is plenty of sun chairs, so if you want to relax poolside in the sun or shade, you can. There is no hot tub. Also, the fitness center is impressive, and I did use that. Equipment was clean, towels and water are provided. Finally, it was quiet (even with our non-ideal view).The staff was great. From check in to check out, they were amazing. My husband forgot his toothbrush, and they brought one to our room complimentary. We needed a bottle opener, and they graciously allowed us to borrow one. The activities desk was helpful in getting us booked on adventures, and the bellman was awesome in getting us a taxi to the airport at a flat rate.As others have mentioned, it is a reasonably priced hotel, great service, and a good location. I definitely will return again.","Seattle, Washington","EDG2001</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",44,4.0

Yes but there are going to cost you. This Hilton however, is a clean, reasonably priced hotel in a great location - close to the beach and to plenty of shopping and food options - and features everything you need. Our room was a bit on the small side and consisted of two double beds instead of the usual queen (we were aware of this ahead of time). It was enough space for a family of three but it might be tight for a family of hour. Though small, the space was very well used with plenty of storage and seating and there was a fridge and microwave. Our room was on the third floor and looked out on a parking lot/back of another hotel. It wasn't scenic but it was quiet. And even better, we were on the same floor as the pool. This was extremely convenient as it meant that we could quickly and easily jump back and forth between the pool (and the sunscreen dispenser) and our room.I need to give a special shoutout to the housekeeping staff. My daughter peed on both beds at two different times on the same day, after of course, housekeeping had been by. The first time housekeeping was still on our floor and I just grabbed some new sheets right from them. The second time I had to call housekeeping and they came down while we were out at dinner and not only brought new sheets but made up both beds.

We arrived around 12:30pm and our room was not ready yet - check in is at 3pm. The front desk clerk took my phone number and said he would call us as soon as a room was ready. We checked in our luggage and went to walk around. No problem. We still had not received a call 2 hours later, so we went back to the hotel around 2:30pm to check to see if our room was ready. There was another clerk this time he said they had several, so we finally got our room. Given that a room was ready, but we didn't get a call, I'm not sure we ever would have gotten a call. Our room was basic with a King Bed, microwave, refrigerator, big flat screen Samsung TV, and Keurig coffee machine. It was very clean.Here are things we liked:- The King Bed was very comfy and we slept pretty good- The TV was nice and it allowed us to use the HDMI port on the side to hook up our Amazon Firestick so we could watch TV just like we do at home.- The bathroom was nice with a big shower.- The Keurig coffee machine had 6 pods of different coffee as well as some tea.- It has a microwave and refrigerator (however our fridge didn't work too well)- it has USB ports on most of the electrical plugs. This was super convenient for charging our phones and ipads.- The room was pretty quiet, but we could hear some neighbors talking occasionally.- The location is great. It's a 7 minute walk to the beach and there's food and stores everywhere nearby. There a supermarket literally across the street for any necessities you may need.There were just a couple things we didn't like in the room. - Our thermostat didn't work right and simply wouldn't turn off no matter what temperature was set. This took us 2 nights figure out after the second night we woke up freezing. Our thermostat was set to 74 degrees, but the room was at 69 degrees and the way the fan is situated, it blows right onto the bed. I told t he front desk the morning about the issue on our way out the next morning and he said it would be taken care of. We came back to our room around 5pm and it looked like someone had done something to the thermostat as the settings were different than when we left it. However, it still didn't work right and still wouldn't shut off. We just learned to deal with it.- The refrigerator was barely cold and there's no adjustment to make it colder. I got around this by filling the ice bucket with ice from the ice machine and putting our drinks in ice in the fridge. - The fan in the bathroom was loud. You can hear it sounds like a bearing is going out and the fan turns on each time the light is on. It's loud enough to be annoying and I would have thought the maids would have noticed it. Not a big deal, but probably should have fixed.Overall, we enjoyed our stay here and would stay here again. I can recommend this hotel, just make sure your thermostat and refrigerator works on your first day and not halfway into your trip like us.","Sacramento, California","Remo_Gaggi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",40,3.0

The rooms are on the smaller side, but very comfortable for 2 people. They are also very clean, fresh, and modern. Ours had a fairly large balcony with table and chairs.Staff are attentive and welcoming.We stayed in the hotel for 9 nights during the Christmas period, so I assume we would have paid a peak period price (even though we got a good deal). So because of that, the value for money was not that great.The pool area is large enough, however the pool is on the small side and was crowded at times... and it's not a very interesting area, it's lacking character, and doesn't make you want to hang out there for long... maybe that's the plan.Also, be aware that they have introduced a resort fee of US$25 per day which you have to pay the hotel directly. In my view, it's not worth it and holds no real value, but it's mandatory. As we had booked the hotel just as the change was being made back in May 2018, we managed to negotiate not paying the fee (which the hotel was very good about).Having said all that, I would definitely recommend this hotel and gave it a 7.75/10.","Melbourne, Australia","IntrepidMatt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",11,4.0

The service and accommodations fall short of what is to be expected.Here are some things I've experienced and that you should take into account when considering this place.1. In addition to the nightly rates, there is a mandatory $26 a day resort fee and if you are driving your own vehicle, a $39 a day valet parking fee with in and out privileges. There is no self parking. Both fees for a seven night trip will be around $500. This does not include the tips to the valets and cleaning crew.2. Check in experience - Wait times can be from walk up to 15 minutes. When we arrived, there was a line to check in with regular customers and airline crews. I needed to use the restroom while my wife waited in line. Most hotel restrooms in Waikiki need an access code or key. I asked a counter clerk if there was a code to the restroom. She said there was a line and pointed to where my wife was standing and that was it. Okay, so I went to the Hilton Vacations Club desk and asked the rep there who walked me to the bathroom and opened it. Thanks a lot for nothing, front desk clerk.3. Thoughts on room. We got a double double, two double beds. If you have a family of four with teens, good luck...it can be a tight squeeze. The room is on the smaller side. Room was refurbished recently and the furnishing has good and bad points. The good - There is an adequate sized fridge but you cannot adjust the thermostat. There is a microwave and Keurig coffee maker with coffee and tea. An electric water pot heats up water for tea, etc. The wash basin is located in the room so bring an eye mask because when the lighting can be a bother if you are sensitive. The bathroom has a single toilet that has a decent flush and the shower only compartment is roomy and the shower head has good flow. The bath amenities are basic (Neutrogena). The towels not so plush but serviceable. The fixtures are nice for the most part. The bathroom door is a sliding door that does not lock but has a soft closing mechanism that does not slam. The same goes for the closet and fridge doors. Lighting is decent but could be brighter in some areas. Now for a warning.... our room had a bench fixture rather than a couch. One section under the television is probably meant for placing suitcases and other things on and not meant for sitting. If one did not know and tried to plop down in that area, the result will surely result in a bruised tailbone. It is rock hard. The covering is the same as the area to the right which is meant for sitting but also very firm. Very strange design concept. Another warning, the room door does not have a closing restrictor and will slam shut if you do not hold it. We have been awaken a few times by our neighbors who allowed the door to slam shut at 5:30 am in the morning. Why did they not install restrictors on the room doors????4. Now for the not so good and nasty. Upon arrival, my wife always checks the bedding for unwanted crawly guests. None were found but the bed linen had brown specks on them (blood?) We called for housekeeping to change out the sheets and pillows. The next morning, my kids saw on the mattress cover a stain that looked like vomit or some other bodily fluid. We, again called housekeeping and were told they would contact us. Got a call a bit later and was told that all linen in the room were exchanged. Hhhmm, the housekeeping staff didn't notice that? That takes us to housekeeping. They are friendly but horribly inefficient. First and second day already mentioned here. On Day 3, came back at 5 PM to find they just started cleaning our room. On Day 4, no housekeeping...my wife had to track them down to exchange towels, take our trash and replace the tissue box. They skipped our room. Day 5, they cleaned our room at a decent time and we came back to everything nicely made up. Day 6, they, again, skipped our room and again my wife had to call at 4:30 pm to get room serviced. On Day 7, we saw them down the hall and asked the room to be cleaned. Nope, there is no notice that rooms will be cleaned upon request, our neighbors' rooms were cleaned daily. We must have had some bad jujues.5. Air conditioning - Worked great...according to my wife, too efficiently. The room was cold at times where we had to turn up temp. 6. Some high points of staying at this property - We drove so we paid for the valet parking. Those guys work hard and always were smiling and cordial. Remember to tip them. When you call for your car, make sure you allow about ten minutes for it to be ready. Not sure where they park it but it takes some time. An important note, the entrance to the valet driveway and hotel is located on Walina St, not Kuhio St. There is no stopping on Kuhio.; Very convenient location. It is literally at the front entrance to the International Market and other shopping venues and eating establishments. There is the Food Pantry market right across the street so if you need anything from the grocery, it's right there. Very easy location to walk around Waikiki.7. A final note about the elevators. Even though there are four elevators, it can be slow. We were on the fifth floor and found ourselves walking it both up and down because of the crowd or wait time. Yep, those elevators must be on local time.Would I stay here again? Not sure...the staff is friendly except for that clerk on the first day. It can get noisy and bothersome with the slamming doors. The sliding doors to the balcony are very well insulated so you don't hear any street noise. If you get a good price for a room, it can be a nice and convenient place to stay.",Escondido,"Wil W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Escondido</strong>",17,3.0

The bed was comfortable. Excellent shower! Friendly cleaning staff.The not-so-good: the room was tiny (a king city view room).

The hallway was also loud; whenever a neighboring room opened or closed their door, it sounded like someone was breaking into our room; a very loud noise that sounded like it was at our door. No evidence of any ""green"" initiatives. Check-in was not necessarily pleasant. The greeting wasn't very warm, and while this might not be this property, but a reason for me never to stay at a Hilton again, they wouldn't put this on my Hilton Honors because we booked through Expedia. I still chose to stay at a Hilton, but was made to be felt ""less valuable"". I also walked away from check-in without knowing what the daily resort fee was. I realize I should have asked since it was a long time since we'd booked, but I shouldn't have had to ask. The desk clerk went through what it covered (stupid stuff), but didn't mention the amount. Not a big deal, it's $25, but again, felt like I wasn't being treated like a valued customer.The attached Halo Halo market was actually quite nice; better than the ABC stores all around, and many items a little cheaper.According to the hotel booklet, we were supposed to receive an email on our checkout day with our bill, but we did not.

When staying here you’re still close to everything but pavement foot traffic is about 25% that of a block closer to the ocean… not fighting to get by other pedestrians is always a bonus…Our king bedroom with partial ocean view was typical for this type of Hilton and other hotels in the area and was comfortable enough and well fitted out with all the usual facilities.

Outdoor pool located on the 3rd floor was small and the towel ""vending"" machine was a turnoff so I just used room towels. I did not see a hot tub at the property.

We live on the Big Island and while my boyfriend had to fly over for business, I came along to do some shopping. We got a decent deal on a room through the Hilton Friends and Family program. Now, let me start with what is good about this hotel, this is from what I could tell from a very short stay. The location, while not right on the main drive, is located right across the street from the International Marketplace, so a short walk through the Marketplace will bring you right out onto the main Waikiki strip. I think the rooms in this hotel were recently renovated, so the decor is nice and modern, and the room was very clean. The room does have a Keurig for your convenience and a microwave should you need it. We hardly spent any time in the room, but if we did, the nice flat screen TV would have been a plus to watch some Sunday football. Now, on to what is odd about this hotel. The entrance. If you arrive by car, you will most likely come in through their porte, which is on the side of the hotel. When you enter, it brings you into this hallway, you have to walk down this hallway, past the elevators, to get to the main lobby and to the front desk. So entering this hotel is not the most pleasing visually, but the lobby is nice once you get to it. Also the rooms do not have great sound proofing, we could always clearly hear doors opening and closing near by. It sounded like our door was opening, but it was rooms close by. The only meal we ate in this hotel was breakfast, it was ok. The breakfast is fairly cheap, so it's a nice deal since you can get made to order omelettes as part of your buffet, which I believe was only $12.95. It's hard to rate service in a buffet, but we had to wait a while to get our bill, in fact, we had to ask the host to find our waitress because we were in a rush to leave.Now, here's some good with the bad. We did utilize the valet parking because it was just more convenient. The valet appears to be outsourced to a third party. I did find them to be very thorough and professional, but so overpriced. This seems to be a regular trend with Hilton hotels here though. $38 a day plus tips for parking. Plus the hotel charges you $25 a day for this ""resort fee"". I'm not sure what you get for this fee, but I am pretty sure we didn't use any of it during our overnight stay. So even if we got our room for just under $100 for the night, we paid over $60 in parking and BS fees.We did not use the pool, but we did see it several times on the elevator, apparently it's on the 3rd floor. We know this because when the elevator opens up on the 3rd floor, you can clearly see the pool. It looks small, but it never looked overcrowded when we looked at it from the balcony.Overall, it was a pleasant stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. We would stay here again.","Island of Hawaii, Hawaii","hapunagirlpt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Island of Hawaii, Hawaii</strong>",37,4.0

The only problem was that ants are found walking around the sink and on the floor near the sink. The staff explained to us that it's ""unavoidable"" due to the tropical weather on the island. I had options of either have the room sprayed with organic chemical, non toxic to human, or change to a different room the next day as there was no other available room right now. I chosed to have the room sprayed the next morning. I left the room 10am in the morning, told the staff again to spray the area we found ants as a reminder. Guess what happened at 5pm when I returned, nothing was done. Asked the front desk to follow up and finally housekeeping showed up. The staff was holding a bottle of bug spray consists of citric acid as main ingredient. The bottle was almost empty so he added more tap WATER to the bottle in order to make the bottle spray. As you can predict if you're still reading, the ants are back the next day. I call the front desk the N times and finally we decide to change room.

The bed was excellent and the room generally clean (I did find quite a bit of dust on the top shelf areas. A worker would need to be tall or get a footstool to reach these areas. Management needs to ensure that is done at least a couple of times a week.)The location is absolutely perfect for walking to many, many restaurants and shops. Just 5 minutes walk to the water of Waikiki Beach. Right next door to the hotel is a true grocery store (more than just a convenience store) where supplies can be picked up for a reasonable (at least for Hawaii reasonable) cost.The only downside is the buffet breakfast. As a Hilton Gold Member I have had many Hilton G.I. breakfasts through the years and this one is to a much lower standard than what I have experienced elsewhere. As best I can tell Hilton does not actually operate the restaurant (unlike other Garden Inn's). If only the breakfast buffet pictures you see in the lobby matched what you actually see in the restaurant. After experiencing what was offered I sorely wished I had declined the buffet, taken the bonus points instead, and bought my own breakfast elsewhere.I'd definitely stay here in the future, but I would not take the breakfast.","Atlanta, Georgia","yes2travel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",280,4.0

The staff and management are also past their prime. Supposedly, there was a recent multi-million dollar renovation. As you can see in my picture, doors don't fit. This is a ""Hilton"" in name only.Our reservation was screwed up when we checked in. At first, they claimed the room we reserved was what we were given and didn't budge, until we proved them wrong. The room they initially gave us was like a college dorm room, very small with two double beds. They refused to correct their mistake until the following day. They also gave us the run around on moving our luggage into the correct room. Very disappointing. Very unprofessional.Once in the room we reserved, things were better, but not great. This room was bigger, but still smaller than you would expect at a Hilton. Quality of craftsmanship in the room was poor. The room was dark at night, even with all of the lights on. The bathroom was not laid out well. Sliding door that didn't lock or latch. Poor lighting. All the lighting is aligned behind your head, so you have shadows when you use the mirror. There are two hooks to hang your things on, both very close to the shower curtain and only about 3-4 inches apart, so not a good place to hang clothes. The shower water temperature started hot, but gradually cooled during my showers. There is a master light switch by the entrance door and a regular light switch. The master switch shuts everything off. Our maid would always shut off the master switch, so if we left anything plugged in to recharge - forget that. The air conditioner was aligned to blow on the top of the bed - not the most comfortable alignment.So, I really don't think I would ever consider staying here again. There are a lot of other choices.","Marysville, Ohio","J-from-Marysville</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marysville, Ohio</strong>",203,3.0

We like to stay on Kuhio Street as it is just one back from the main road and beach, but a little quieter and there are some really good restaurant options close by. And this hotel is almost directly across the road from the International Market.On both visits we were accommodated on the 16th floor with a reasonable sort of view thru the other high rises to the ocean. The first room se stayed in wasn't as clean as I would expect from Hilton - dusty surfaces, the glass door to the lanai needed a thorough clean and the back of the toilet seat had been overlooked as had the tile floor in the entry. Second stay however, the room was spotless, but one of the USB connections didn't work, along with a bedside light. The bathroom could do with a towel rail as there is no where to hang towels once you have used them. The electric kettle was a very welcome surprise. Quite like my cup of tea in the morning!I wish Hilton would look at providing proper cups, glasses and spoons though, rather than all the disposable stuff that is in the room. There is such a global push now towards reducing plastic, Hilton needs to get on board with this.We enjoyed the pool area - the pool isn't large or deep, but it's fine to cool off in. There were certainly plenty of kids enjoying it whilst we were there and making use of the inflatable's that the hotel provides. i thought the sunscreen and cooling cream were a great inclusion. However, the pool loungers are the most uncomfortable things I have ever sat in.The bar and restaurant downstairs were good value - the bar has happy hour that goes on all night!On our second visit we had a car for a couple of days, which we parked (probably illegally) across the road at the Food Pantry carpark.There is also a guest laundry (yay, always makes me happy) and I must give a big shout out to the two male staff that came and helped us out (sorry don't remember their names) when the washing machine we were using wouldn't operate on the cycle we had selected. One of them went off and got a tool to open the machine and an instruction book on how to reprogramme the machine, and within a few minutes, they had that washing machine all sorted out for us!We would definitely stay here again, the good certainly outweighed the few issues we encountered.The Good:Lovely staff, especially the guys that helped us out in the laundryElectric Kettle in the roomNice modern roomsGreat locationNice pool area including a pool bar (with great staff)Bar & restaurant downstairs with all night happy hour :)The Not So Good:Room cleanlinessDisposable cups & stirrers grrrrSlooooow elevatorsNo towel rail in the bathroomUncomfortable pool loungersLate afternoon servicing of the the room","Auckland, New Zealand","z1bby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",56,4.0

The hotel is opposite the International Market Place and really close to the pink trolley stop.The positives:- Great price for a great location- large rooms (comparative to other hotels) with an unusual but acceptable bathroom set up (the 'bathroom' which has a door is the toilet and large shower) the sink, mirror and towels are all in what is really a hall table as you walk in. The bonus of this is that someone can be brushing their teeth while someone else is using the toilet or showing. The negative is that it's the same area that the hairdryer, kettle (slowest kettle in the world to boil) is, so you end up with coffee, toothpaste, soaps etc all sharing the same spot. But overall, quite an efficient use of the space.- beds were OK - a little bit soft but not badly. The negative was that while the top sheet was cotton, the duvet cover is a poly mix, and already pulled and ripped in places. The sheets were only changed once while we were there, which I didn't feel was enough, given that you are often sandy.- the TV was OK - no movies of anything other than TV stations and a very slow TV guide, but functional to catch news and weather and you're not in Hawaii to watch TV- the microwave was a bonus and was used a lot- the mini fridge is a good size and, thankfully, empty, i.e. no silly minibar at stupid prices- the towels were always topped up and clean and the amenities were OK (Neutrogena)- there was a decent wardrobe (many other hotels we looked at didn't have this at all) and included an ironing board, iron and safe, as well a some hangers which were thankfully not attached to the rack.- on each floor near the elevators there was a waste and recycle bin (and a phone) so it was good to be able to recycle plastic food containers, milk bottles etc. It's the first time I've seen recycle bins in a hotel, so points for that.- is opting for a room with a lanai (balcony) it's small but has a small table and two chairs and is large enough to hang a washing line- the hotel has it's own coin operated laundry ($3 for a wash cycle or a dry cycle and there are three of each machine. The coin machine was broken the whole time we were there but it doesn't take long to accumulate $3 in quarters, which is what was required and the front desk would change if needed (there was no washing powder but you can buy a one pack from the store opposite the hotel for $1- the hotel is opposite a Food Pantry which is a far cheaper way of buying milk and snacks rather than the ABC Stores. There is also a market off the hotel foyer, which is well stocked (everything from milk through to beer and prepackaged meals and souvenirs) but not cheap- you can book tours in the hotel and the two that we booked were great and the same price as you'd pay if you booked directly with the provider.- the gym was small but well set out - a small room with 3 or 4 treadmills and a couple of bikes and another weight room - both had antiseptic wipes, towels and water provided The negatives:- the rooms have air-conditioning, but it's the older sort that has a large unit next to the balcony door, It works well but is quite loud and ours had a weird whistle as it turned itself off. - when you get out of the lift, the hall to the rooms are 'open air', i.e. you are walking past a balcony overlooking the pool and Saks 5th Ave, then turning down halls that have the room doors off that. Odd and when rainy and windy, you get wet returning to your room, although to be fair that only happened once.- while there is a pool, it's small, was quite cold (which sounds odd for a tropical location but it was REALLY cold) and was always full of kids that were screaming and throwing balls. The pool area has a bar but due to the endlessly screaming children, it was not a restful place to be. There were lots of deckchairs though, if that's your thing, which are in shade at certain points in the day.- The biggest negative was the restaurant attached to the hotel. We thankfully didn't pay to have breakfast included as the one time we ate there on the first day, it was disappointing. It was a $13.95 buffet, but the choices were quite limited and of a fodder food quality. My friend did the eggs menu (a card on the table that you write up for eggs/omelette etc) and enjoyed the (small) omelette but the rest of the food (including the Hawaiian Ham - a stewed ham in a pineapple sauce?) was ordinary. The staff were rushed and not particularly friendly. There are much better and cheaper places to have breakfast nearby.- there was a false emergency evacuation while we were there which was not well handled - no staff at the exit points but they handled our comments well when we advised of our concerns, They advised that there was a PA announcement that it was a false alarm but this could not be heard in the stairwells (which they undertook to review).So overall a good hotel which had more good features than bad and we would stay there again given it was good value for a perfect location.","Tasmania, Australia","brolidays</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tasmania, Australia</strong>",44,4.0

Free coffee/tea in the mornings next to elevators (4). Guest restroom on Lobby floor near elevators, room card required for use. Wanted this suite over the others since bathroom door is between living area and bedroom. In the other suites a guest would have to enter the living area to reach the bathroom (possibly disturbing the person sleeping there). There were 3 of us in the room, so 1 was sleeping on the sofa. I think 4 would be too crowded. Note the Hilton reservation system has a bug concerning this room. If searching based on 3 persons, the room didn't show up, but searching on 2 persons it did. Do like we did, book for 2 and then on arrival change to 3, hotel rate will be higher due to extra person. Living area and bedroom are small. Bedroom had a king bed with just enough walking space around the bed and TV is wall mounted on the side wall. There is a small open walkin closet with a low counter that can accommodate 2 carryon size suitcases on it. Your suitcases are your dresser, there are some shelves in the counter, and small drawers in the 2 nightstands but no normal dressers. There is a narrow outside seating area the length of the bathroom-bedroom with a small table and 2 chairs. There is also another small table and 2 chairs on the outside area by the living area. Ice machines are not on every floor and the ice is large shaved vs cubes. Bathroom is small but the shower is large (no tub). Living area has a electric hot pot, Keurig coffee machine, microwave and mini-refrigerator. In my opinion the refrigerator does not get cold enough to store leftovers, so we used gallon size ziplock bags with ice on the top shelf and on/next to the food, which worked well. Bag of ice in the evening and the next morning, still had a half bag of ice (rest water). Front desk and valet parking staff were helpful and friendly. Housekeeping did a good job. 4 stars instead of 5 because of the mini-refrigerator.","Honolulu, Hawaii","BlackStripe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",46,4.0

We arrived very early in the morning as check out at this hotel isn’t to midday our room wasn’t ready. They went out of their way to give us maps, bottles of water and told us they would ring us when our room was ready hopefully by 3.00pm. We wondered down to the beach which is a 5 minute walk to find somewhere for lunch upon return around 3 the staff as promised had our room sorted. We upgraded at $75.00 per night to a suite with seperate living area and partial sea view which I’m pleased we did as we could check out the action on the water from our veranda with a drink in the afternoon. House keeping were very thorough lots of clean towels left each day. A couple of things we didn’t enjoy no glasses in room which I thought very odd only paper cups to drink out of and a coffee machine with no instructions which I had no idea how to work. Although there was a jug there was no tea bags or coffee sachets not even a tea spoon so a bit odd really as to what the jug was for. The pool was a bit sterile with no sun umbrellas and loungers lined up in rows very close to your neighbours which felt a bit weird so we didn’t use the pool area at all. I’m not sure if the restaurant/bar was part of the Hilton or seperate but the service was rubbish we went in there one morning for brunch and felt like we were an inconvenience we were told to find a seat and someone would bring us a menu 15 minutes later we went to the bar and got our own menu they couldn’t provide us with earl grey tea and the sandwich was pretty average needless to say we didn’t go back for food. They also have a small shop/cafe which was handy however I was turned away on day of arrival when getting an iced coffee as they couldn’t break my 100 dollar note and went to no effort to try dispute there being several other tills around them. All and all the highlight is location and staff who were all very friendly. Would we stay here again probably not as for the price there are many places in the 300-400 dollar per night price bracket.","Wellington, New Zealand","SueLevien</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",4,4.0

Bottom line: it is reasonably priced based on comparable properties in the area. 99% of staff members were always extremely nice. All common areas were always really clean. The pool is meticulously cleaned every morning, which was important for us. We stayed in two different rooms. One was just a King and the other was King with couch. Both of which did not have any type of dresser. If you can find a way to book your reservation without the resort fee, do that because I really don't think that was justified. If we had to pay the resort fee we would have just spent a few dollars more on the room and paid a resort fee at one of the nice properties with more amenities in Waikiki. If you are a gold or diamond honors member, the breakfast is pretty good. I don't advise eating it for a month, but for a week its pretty good. Please also be advised that its $39 a day for parking.

This time we arrived as the year before about 2 pm but were warmly welcomed by a nice lady who checked us in and, per my request, gave us a late check-out as well. I noticed on-line that we had been upgraded to a partial oceanview suite, but when we arrived at our room, #1538, I was stunned. We had 2 balconies...one of which wrapped around the corner of the building. After the cramped room the year before with barely enough room to sneeze, we had a nice sized main room plus a small room with a sofa (not sure if it was a sofabed or not), and a huge bathroom with tub/shower combo. One balcony was accessed from the bedroom, and the wrap-around balcony was accessed from the smaller room. The bathroom was attached to the smaller room. In the main room was the kingsized bed, another TV, a ledge under the TV, a kettle station area with microwave, fridge, and Keurig coffee supplies and machine. There were some issues however: 1) no drawers anywhere except tiny ones in bedside tables, 2) no outlets under the TV but ample ones by the bed, and 3) a bed that needs harder pillows and a slightly firmer mattress. We received breakfast due to our Diamond status. It was as last year in the TR restaurant on the ground floor. There is a buffet with the usual plus fried rice, Hawaiian ham, and more but no scrambled eggs. All eggs had to be ordered via the pads on the table. I had egg white omelets both mornings. Waffles, pancakes, eggs Benedict, a breakfast sandwich, and Loco Moco are extra? I don't usually eat waffles and pancakes, but they are usually standard at HGI-sometimes make your own and sometimes made in the kitchen. The other 3 I can understand an upcharge. Since we receive breakfast complimentary, I am not sure if they would have given us any of these as well without paying more, but I was happy with my omelets and items from the buffet such as meats, fruits, and more. I also requested an extra large glass both mornings since I drink lots of water and was given one without any fuss. Overall, I am giving a 5 despite the few minor issues noted. I was much happier at the HGI this year versus last year. Breakfast was about the same, but the room and the front desk staff were above and beyond this time.

Basically discounts on stuff I didn’t want, two non alcoholic drinks and some crummy sunscreen. Only time I got burned in 8 days was the day I used their sunscreen. NO HOSPITALITY SUITE. It’s the only hotel I have stayed in in Waikiki that does not offer a hospitality suite to shower/freshen up after check out. This was particularly annoying because the latest check out we could get was 2pm and our flight wasn’t until 730pm. I probably won’t stay here again.

I chose to stay in busy Waikiki and decided on this hotel. It’s a great location, close to the beach about 3 blocks, close to shopping and the options for food is abundant! And not to mention a grocery store, Food Pantry is across the street for all your needs, has a deli, and coffee shop! Our room was clean but very small, we barely fit our BOB stroller. It had a fridge and microwave which was nice for our little family when the little ones got hungry later. There is a pool but that too is small, we went there a few times and it was never too busy that it wouldn’t accommodate enough people. Weird towel policy, you must use your key card to get towels out, but there’s no count of how many is taken, yet you must return the towels (and don’t use key card to return) or be charged $20 per towel. None of the guests figured the logic but returned towels anyways - even when the bin was overflowing and couldn’t fit anymore! The staff was so so, I appreciate the valet, bell folks and house keeping more. The front desk people just weren’t as sincere. Some notes, valet is required and it’s spendy, should you choose to rent a car. The elevators are slow and their sensors may need some adjustments, I swear there were moments I wonder if someone was going to lose their hand! Thank you house keeping for keeping our room so clean, much appreciation to them.My biggest disappointment is how the hotel handled the smoking in the hotel. Apparently it is a non smoking hotel but I know there was a guest smoking in the room. Hey, not against it, but the smell got to our room, and y’all know it’s a pungent smell. I tolerated for barely a day but had enough when my 3 yo asked mommy why the room smells funky. And when I called to complain, the reaction at the front desk was completely inappropriate, hanging up on me! I called back, she tried to change her voice but I know I got the same girl, not sure if she gave me her real name, Christine, (call took place on 6/16/18 @ 8:57 PM). Her second response was better which I should have heard the first time, she said she would send house keeping to investigate. I don’t think they did, until the next day. Long story short, they eventually offered to move us although inconvenient, and gave us free breakfast buffet tickets. The breakfast buffet at TK Grill was nothing to brag about.Sorry Hilton, I’m terribly disappointed in how you handle and enforce your own hotel policies and won’t stay here again and won’t be recommending this to others.

We loved the location! Customer service at the hotel was excellent. Desk staff, bell staff, pool staff, cleaning staff and valet staff were all helpful whenever we made a request. We had requested a high floor and were on 18 overlooking buildings but I still sat on the balcony and drank my morning coffee. We had no road/city noise being up high and with a building view, which I liked. The room was average size and fine for my husband and myself. My daughter and her husband were in the other room and they also felt like they had plenty of room. I had read that people had to wait a lot for the elevator. The hotel was full and we did not ever have to wait more than a minute or two. I had also read that folks had issues with the buffet breakfast. We loved it! It was well-stocked and really tasty. We usually ordered eggs and they were delivered promptly. We had free breakfast each day but the $13.95 price would have been reasonable for what we ate. We valet parked the car (39.00 per day) and never waited long for the car. There were 4 of us and we all thought the hotel was great and did not have any problems. Great customer service and we would definately stay here again. ","Clyde, North Carolina","denisecU1364VN</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clyde, North Carolina</strong>",22,5.0

I had booked through Costco.ca as they offered a better price than Booking.com and complimentary pick-up / drop-off. Staff were attentive, we got in late as our flight landed at 11 pm. We arrived at the hotel past midnight where there were 2 staff to greet us at the front desk. We ordered two conjoined rooms for more ease but in all honestly, one room was enough space for us. I had to get my own room due to someone's loud snoring! The walls were thick enough that I did not hear his snoring.I loved the entrance of the room and washroom. The entrance were just like the pics advertised with a mirror, sink and lots of counter-space with storage underneath. Across was the washroom area where the toilet was separated with a sliding door and glass wall for shower. LocationA great location for a tourist who plans to take local transit and eat Asian cuisine. There were many ramen, udon and Japanese restaurants in the area along with Cheesecake Factory (Canada only has one as of this entry) so it was a novelty for us Canadians. Across the hotel was Saks Fifth Avenue where it was attached to the International Market Place (IMP). Local friends told me this market place underwent massive renovation which now hosts designers shoes and clothing brands. In the past, it was considered for local hangout I was more interested in the upstairs part for the Asian grocery sold Japanese makeup and skincare products. Inside, also had Moodo (moochi + donuts) in multiple flavours and really affordable! I wish we had one in Toronto, it would put Tim Horton's donuts out of business. We were on the lower floors and faced the grocery store's parking lot. The view wasn't great but the area was clean so didn't mind it. AmenitiesA swimming pool and laundry room are available for use. I did not know they had a laundry room, if I had known in advance, would have brought less clothes. The hotel also has an attached grocery / convenient store for you to pick up pre-made meals. Definitely more convenient and priced reasonable across other nearby groceries. However, the best prices I found to be at 7/11 across Hawaii Convention Centre. It's quite a long walk so taking the bus (purchase a $5 day pass for unlimited use) is recommended if you'd like more of an authentic Hawaii / Japanese cuisine vs tourist-target ABC stores.","Toronto, Canada","Sakura905</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",5,5.0

But that wasn’t the case. Selected a top floor room. Got in and the room was huge, two exit doors to a balcony, lots of space to move around. Laid down and heard a very loud mechanical humming noise, so loud it affected our ability to sleep. So at 3am, we requested to move rooms. The night auditor staff went above and beyond to try to get us at least another room with a king bed, and the one they found for us was smaller but got the job done. (They offered to move us again the next day to what they said was an upgraded room, but it was absolutely tiny and we elected to stay in room #2.)All rooms we saw were clean and about as quiet as you can get in a city. No issues with elevators (other than they display eastern time for some reason). The included breakfast for higher HHonors members was the best I’ve had at any HGI in the country. Two options are offered, we tried both and loved both.My reason for the low review is the issue with the first room, and what I feel was an inappropriate remedy. While we were fine with the room we ended up in, it was labeled a “King Standard Low Floor” and we booked a “King Deluxe.” And I paid the deluxe rate for the standard room. That doesn’t seem reasonable to me, and I won’t return as a result.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","spade7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",66,3.0

Check-in was smooth, in spite of the number of people milling about the lobby and coincidentally enough, we saw that the flight crew we were flying with was also staying at the same hotelThe facilities were great and looked new (or were recently renovated). Coffee was available in the lobby in the morning and during the afternoon, there was fruit-infused water (i think was strawberry and pineapple). Apparently the hotel was pretty booked, so the best the front desk could do was put us on the 3rd floor. Having Gold status, we opted for the breakfast and we received vouchers which could be either for a breakfast buffet or the cafe, where you could opt a combination of things. The food at the buffet is the same everyday (rice, potatoes, eggs, bacon/sausage, fruit, yogurt, bread/pastries), so if you get bored, you can switch to the cafe breakfast, which is more grab and go--any coffee beverage they make, plus a hot breakfast sandwich or a pastry and a fruit combo. They do have a variety of pastries you can choose from their display case and the coffees are made-to-order.Location is great-in the middle of Waikiki. While you're not on the beach you are a few blocks walk away. We weren't intending to spend more than a few hours at Waikiki beach (it's way too crowded for our taste), so that worked out ok. They do let you ""check out"" pool/beach towels. In the pool area, there's a towel container, where you use your key card to unlock the door and then take some towels. Then when you're done you return it in the bin next to it, which doesn't require any key card. The sign says you'll get charged for unreturned towels. We still haven't figured out how the return tracking system works, but appreciate the amenity. We didn't use the pool, but it seemed to be a pretty popular hangout for guests.Otherwise, you have shopping and some restaurants across the street at the International Market Place (IMP). If you're renting a car, Avis is right inside the IMP and you can rent a car for the day from them and return it before they close to avoid the $40+tax valet nightly parking fee at the hotel. Another cool thing about being across the street from IMP is that if it's raining, you can practically get all the way down to Lewers Street with minimal exposure to the rain via the IMP and then the Royal Hawaiian Center.Check-out was smooth and when we requested a late checkout we got an extra hour added.","Boston, Massachusetts","Jbd1010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",38,5.0

Before flying to Oahu and staying at the HGI Waikiki I read some reviews as anyone does these days. I was hesitant about a few things I.e. the customer service, renovations, parking, elevators, water pressure (seriously someone mentioned that specifically), and breakfast quality. In a nutshell, I would absolutely stay at this HGI when we come back and the only one of these things that ended up being any issue was the parking but let’s get real this is Waikiki and anyone that bashes a hotel for parking is nuts. We managed with street parking on Ala Wai and a few of the cross streets no more than 2 blocks from the property. Total parking paid was $3 over 3 days. The customer service was great from the front desk to the fire grill staff to the housekeeping. All of the receptionists were more than happy to assist with any of our requests. I’ve got the Hilton app and used the digital key which was convenient but we checked in anyway to get some waters (Hhoners). The breakfast buffet was great (inside fire grill in lobby), nicely set up and everything you’d want before starting your days of adventures around the island. Omelettes to order, bagels, fruits, coffee, and juices. The room we were in had one king bed and a balcony, with a view to the east which lets you see downtown and the mountains behind the ala wai golf course. Comfortable bed, clean, updated amenities with no issues. Air conditioning was perfect and easily adjustable. Shower was clean with an updated shower head that provided above average pressure. Elevators were not slow at all and the longest we waited was 30 seconds. Yeah they might get full if you’re staying on a top floor but they were by no means slow. 4 elevators total. I haven’t even mentioned location. Not even a 5 minute walk through the aloha marketplace to the beach. Didn’t use the pool on the 3rd floor but the towel “vending machine” was useful. Overall for the price and location this hotel will be difficult to beat. I highly recommend the Waikiki Hilton Garden Inn. Thanks to the staff for a great stay!",,helochris27,3,5.0

The air conditioning had a horrible smell coming out of it so couldn't use that and we couldn't have the ranch sliders open as there were cigarette smokers on the balcony next to us and didn't want to smell that so we sweltered in our room. Housekeeping was hit and miss, sometimes our room was clean and other times it was not. I think the shock factor was the morning of the Ballistic Missile message, it took the hotel 12 minutes from the time we got the message to alert us, they told us to stay in our rooms which no one took notice of and then found out that there is no procedure for them to follow in case of something like this, hence the panic that hit.

Overall, our stay had a lot of nice touches: - the staff were helpful and friendly. - the room was clean and comfortable, and reasonably spacious. We had a king deluxe (king bed plus sofa). The room also has a coffee table that extends to a desk height. - our room (on the west end of a higher floor) had a decent partial ocean, partial city, and partial mountain view.- the balcony, though not large, was more than enough room for two people to read and relax.- the breakfast worked well for us. We liked the choice between a full buffet + cooked to order omelettes and grab-and-go from the market, and appreciated the long hours (6a-11pm).Unfortunately, there are a couple of hotel characteristics that interfered with the quality of our stay, and that were outside of the control of the great staff. The elevators seemed to have serious maintenance issues (at one time, 3 out of 5 were out of service), which made for long waits and long and crowded elevator rides.Additionally, the hotel seems to have been built with doors with large gaps between them and the doorframe. This meant that we'd be awakened by the slamming of doors starting around 5am and could not get back to sleep -- some better sound isolation would go a long way here.If the hotel could fix these two issues, this would be a five star review --- good value, good location, comfortable rooms.

This property used to be pretty run down, but they've upgraded it a bit when Hilton brands took over. It's right across the street from the ""new"" International Marketplace, with high-end shops and restaurants. I miss the ""old"" International Marketplace with its vendors and local deals.The hotel is well maintained and the room was very clean. The balcony gave us a peek at the ocean a few blocks away, and it was nice to be wakened by the sunrise each morning. A/C does a great job of keeping cool, which is a necessary touch in the middle of the city surrounded by buildings that block the ocean breezes.We were initially assigned a room behind the elevator, tucked in a corner with barely room for a bed and a view facing the parking lot and a wall. After inquiring whether this was the best they could do (as I'm a long-time Hilton loyalist and Diamond member), they upgraded us to a suite on the top floor. It was a very nice move on their part, and afforded us expansive views across the Ala Wai golf course and across to the park (as well as the previously mentioned peek at the ocean).Front living area was very nice, with a large TV and coffee setup, together with a small fridge and a cabinet. The couch was comfy and firm, but the area was sparsely furnished because it was an ADA room and needed space for wheelchair accommodation. While we appreciated the large front room area, we really weren't planning to spend much time in the hotel so it wasn't a draw for us. However, there could have been a much better use of space by inserting places to store clothes (dressers, drawer sets, or shelves would have been nice).Speaking of wheelchair accommodation, the bathroom was very large and set up for ADA compliance. There was a roll-in shower with both a shower head and a hand-held shower nozzle. The fold-down bench was very helpful (knees don't work like they used to). However ... this is a horrible layout for a roll-in shower. The drain doesn't work fast enough to release the water, so it pools on the bathroom floor. The tiles became slipper water holes, and there was really no way to take a shower without making a lake across the bathroom floor. We tried extra towels, rolled up and placed like a dam to block the encroaching water, to no avail. Every time my hubs or I took a shower, we'd have to spend the next 15 minutes cleaning up the water and pushing it toward the drain. And BTW, there is not enough downward slant to pull the water toward the drain ... instead, it puddles up just in front of the entry door. We must have used 8 towels every day, for the water dam, for drying ourselves off, and for placing on the floor to avoid mishaps. It was annoying to say the least, but there's not much the hotel folks can do with this horrible bathroom design.There is absolutely no dresser or drawers for your clothes. The small clothes rack, placed at waist height to accommodate ADA, was fairly small and only had five hangars. A call to housekeeping rectified this quite quickly. But there are no places to stick your clothes, and we ended up living out of our suitcases for a week.The employees are lovely and try their best to remain polite and professional, despite a constant stream of guests checking in and out and asking questions. There's also an adjoining time-share desk to the front check-in desk. We stopped by to pick up a ""free"" Hilton tote bag so that we could use it carrying assorted things throughout the week. But we didn't succumb to any time share pitches. There are ample restaurants and stores and shopping within walking distance, and you certainly don't need a car if you plan to stay in Waikiki and/or play on the local beach. However, we did rent a car for part of our visit so that we could drive up to the North Shore and hit the more adventurous waves. A word of advice: plan your drives well before or well after rush hour, as traffic continues to get worse. There's a local food truck next to the hotel, but I wouldn't recommend it. ABC stores abound, and there's a nice grocery store across the street. We grabbed beverages and some fruit to stick in the fridge. The restaurant downstairs has a nice breakfast buffet that was included with our room, and they make pretty good omelettes. If you don't want to sit down to eat, there's also a small convenience store adjoining the hotel lobby and you can pick up all the necessities. I used their coffee bar frequently, and it rivalled Starbucks plus had some tasty smoothie concoctions.","San Diego, California","Navy_Lady</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",164,4.0

Who we are: Travelers from NYC that have been to Hawaii several times--and love the weather, the people, the food, etc. etc. there--but we don't really LOVE spending too much time on the beach or by the pool all that much.LOCATION: *The beach was 5 minutes walk away for us and maybe 8 minutes with my 80-year-old mother (and the pool was also spacious enough with the bar, etc.).* In front of the International Marketplace (w/ boutiques, restaurants in all price ranges, Saks and a Japanese supermarket) and next to a big supermarket w/ various takeout options.* Centrally located, so it is within walking distance of most destinations within Waikiki, including the Zoo, etc.* The trolley stop is on the next block--which gives easy access to the Ala Moana Mher destinations.* Even w/ Uber, a ride to Ala Moana was less than $10, the Museum of Art, $14, etc.THE PROPERTY:* Unlike other area hotels, it is not chaotic. We've stayed at ""better"" hotels such as Hilton Hawaiian Village, The Royal Hawaiian, Outrigger, the Marriott, etc., but we didn't enjoy the chaos everywhere--from the entrance, lobby, the restaurants to the elevators. Hilton Garden Inn, by contrast, felt peaceful in the lobby, the restaurant, the shop, etc.* The gym and the pool were never crowded, even during the New Year period when the hotel was presumably full.* The room was nicely renovated, and it all felt fresh.* Still, there were two resort desks/concierge that took care of our requests/questions.CONS:* I'm an Honors Diamond, but there was no noticeable benefit beyond free breakfast (which Gold would get anyhow) at all. There was no lounge, and there was no room upgrade at all. The premium WiFi was not noticeably faster than the regular free WiFi, and it didn't seem very stable (and it kept on asking for my login info several times daily).* There were only 4 elevators, and there was a long wait several times daily (in the morning and around the check-in time).* The floor plan provided during the digital check-in was grossly inaccurate, so we ended up having to switch rooms.* The breakfast items were identical throughout my 7-day stay, and the selection was quite small (very few hot items, two proteins--bacon and sliced sausages, and limited bread selections, etc.) in comparison to any of the hotels I've stayed in Hawaii--or other Hilton-affiliated hotels. More importantly, the food quality was...memorable but not in a good way. [If you don't get free breakfast, I'd definitely recommend that you NOT pay to get their breakfast.]* The cleaning crew's performance was inconsistent. Our suite would be spotless with all of the supplies replenished one day, then it is barely cleaned the next day...with one of the trash can not even emptied.OVERALL VERDICT:This hotel is perhaps not for everyone. If you are looking for a beach resort--or you would like to be in a resort environment w/ Pina Coladas with umprellas, you may be disappointed. This is a ""city"" hotel w/ little resort feel. But, if you are like us and enjoy the urban environment without spending too much time on the beach, you'd probably be happy. I will definitely stay again.","New York City, New York","NYC212USA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",38,4.0

Your hotel is on Kuhio and not on the very busy Kalakaua which is good and Kuhio is the street where you pick up the local ""The bus"". On the bus they stopped giving out transfers and you have to buy a 5 dollar day ticket to return to your hotel. A short trip is expensive but on the other hand you can travel all around Oahu on the same ticket. It would take you 5-7 hours ! Bring a pillow, bus seats are hard and not comfortable.

What frustrated me with this hotel was the booking was made some 8 months in advance and on booking I requested a high floor, city view per my booking. On arrival, I was greeted by a male concierge and immediately he confirmed my booking being the two rooms. He then threw in, ""oh we give you an upgrade to high floor and city view for an extra $20 per room per night"". Sorry, but I found this like some kind of pre ambush, as the hotel knowingly knew what my requests were and this was obvious just a ploy and attempt to gain more money from the customer. Not impressed, and I did not argue considering it was a family holiday and it was Xmas. It turned out I was given two rooms on the 8th floor down the far end of the building which overlooked a carpark and was very close to another undesirable and rough looking residential building. No views whatsoever, not even sun. The 9 nights, that we experienced was noisy from this building, their occupants, every night someone was dumping bottles in a dumpster in the middle of the night and people screaming throughout the night could be heard. Very disappointing and not what you want on an overseas holiday at Xmas. I found the staff operating at the Garden Inn somewhat distant with no soul and never a greet, most of the time they were just standing behind the desk and looked like they were someplace else. Not a personality amongst them. Rooms were accommodating and newly renovated, cleaning of the rooms we found average. The pool area was nice as was the bar but nothing to write home about. The location of the hotel itself is well situated and close to everything, definitely this what it does have in its favour. Would I stay at this hotel again? As a return visitor to Hawaii, 3 times, I would not stay here again for the issues mentioned. There are a lot things management at this hotel need to get right before this would return stay hotel.

Overall amazing staff member and a great example of Hawaiian hospitality. Next we got up to our ocean view room and fell in love. We decided we wanted a quick bite so we went down to the market in the lobby(delicious and convenient) the room and bathroom were beautiful, the lanai and view took my breath away and the pool was also a great option when the beach was inconvenient (the day we flew out but didn’t leave until late evening) we also had birds that loyally visited us every morning and became our friends during our vacation.

It was convenient to use your room key to borrow towels from a machine by the 3rd floor pool, and bring to the beach. Just be sure to return it or they charge $20 per towel. Ramps were available for strollers which was a necessity in our case. Housekeeping did a good job with cleaning and providing us additional supplies upon request.

So we didn’t have the best sleeps.And we were surprised that we didn’t get the complimentary cookie or mini milk for tea etc. it’s those little things you look forward to on arrival.The other 2 issues we found were that the lifts were really slow.

There's even a Keurig machine with cups that gets refilled by the housekeeper. The bathroom corner has a sliding door that separates the glass enclosed shower and toilet from the rest of the room. The sink is outside of that corner. A drawback of this is that there are only 2 knobs to act as hooks in the shower/toilet area.

We were late checking in due to the late flight but it went smoothly and the staff were lovely. We had notified them that we were celebrating our honeymoon and a milestone birthday so they upgraded us to a one bedroom suite. With two double beds instead of a king (which we had originally booked). Someone might not have been thinking there! They were full up and offered to change us the next day but we wanted to get unpacked and settled so we ended up staying in the room and improvised! The suite was large and comfortable, bed comfy, with microwave, fridge, Keurig machine and a good sized safe. The balcony afforded great views towards Diamond Head and we could see the ocean as well. The staff kept it very clean. Toilet and shower are in a separate ""room"" from the sink. Shower is huge, walk in and with great water pressure. Wifi worked very well in the rooms and the television was large and clear. Downside? Although there's a wardrobe for hanging up clothes, there really isn't anywhere to put other clothes. No dresser and only one shelf in the wardrobe, and the floor that you can use. We stayed for 5 nights and definitely didn't want to live out of a suitcase. Location of the hotel was excellent, close to everything with the beach only a block and a half away. The hotel has a restaurant which we used for breakfast one morning and a meal one evening and were happy with the service and food. Mostly we ate breakfast in the attached cafe as our rate didn't come with free breakfast. The pool area was all right but we only sat out there once, preferring to be off doing other things. Staff was very nice, very helpful any time we needed anything. We used the business computers in the lobby to check in to our flight and look up some information and there is a desk in the lobby with an Expedia representative that can book you on activities or get a car rented for you. The other desk is someone pushing a Hilton time share though so just keep that in mind. Over all, very good marks, I'd stay here again.","Halifax, Nova Scotia","Tvordlj</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Halifax, Nova Scotia</strong>",57,4.0

Our group spent many hours there looking at a Tesla car and solar roof, shopping for cookies, and dining at a top notch steak house with plenty of delicious choices on the menu for every palate.With Waikiki's one-way streets, finding the valet parking area was a bit of a challenge to find (go past the hotel entrance, left around the block to Ala Wai then left again to the side entrance of the hotel to the valet parking area).The lobby is well-staffed and very comfortable. Business stations are readily available as are complimentary coffee and daily newspapers.The room was very suitable and the bed was most comfortable. The bathroom splits toilet and shower from sink and closet.

Christy from housekeeping 14th floor did a great job of keeping the room very clean for the next nine nights. One room had a partial ocean view and the other of the hills behind the hotel. Wardrobe storage was adequate, the safe was big enough to secure most things and we appreciated an empty bar fridge for our use (not a fan of expensive mini bars) A short walk (around 4 Mins) through the International Market Place shopping centre across the road and we were on Kalakaua Avenue which runs along Waikiki Beach. There are numerous ABC stores in the area as well as a Food Pantry supermarket to the left of the hotel.

The bed was comfortable.The Holoholo Café & Market was nice. They had decent breakfast offerings, and had any supplies you might need while you are there.Cons:The elevators were ridiculously slow. Even though there were four of them, it seemed as if only one of them would be operating at any given time. Plan ahead if you plan on using any of them.Ice machines were not on every floor. The closest one to ours was the floor below ours.The internet service was slow.The breakfast buffet at the TR Fire Grill was absolutely appalling. The food was overcooked, and in some cases dry and burnt. We chose to eat breakfast elsewhere as a result.Finally, my wife had arranged for a shuttle with one of the hotel employees.

Big secret the hotel is close to 1 of the best kept secret in Waikiki for food items at the Food Pantry. We visited everyday to stock up on wine and beer plus snacks of all kinds. The staff overall is very friendly and accommodating. I asked the bell hop to reserve a taxi for me to the airport the morning of our departure but it was done. I had to scramble at the last minute to get someone else to take us to the airport. My husband loved the balcony and the pool on the 3rd floor. You don't need a bigger pool, people are on vacation for lounging around not exercising for the ones who complain about the size. The beach is near by for swimming. This hotel is worth every dollar you spend. Rooms are small but ideal for couples plus in Waikiki nobody is spending time in the room, you are at the beach or shopping! Thanks once again Hilton Garden Inn Waikiki for making my visit memorable.","Raleigh, North Carolina","spicyjamaicangirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Raleigh, North Carolina</strong>",18,5.0

My dad is a Hilton honors member and most Hilton hotels we have stayed at are good. When we booked the hotel there was a promotion going on for members, but even without the membership prices seemed really good for a Hilton hotel. The hotel's location was probably the best thing about the hotel. It it's a couple blocks away from the beach, and across the street from the International market place. Overall location was great. So close to everything you can just walk. Overall is a clean hotel when you walk in and what not. The rooms were a lot smaller than we thought, especially for what normal rates are. Also even after we left the hotel room all day we can back around midday/evening/dinner time and housekeeping still hadn't made it to our room. Some days we saw them a couple rooms down, we left thinking they'd get to ours soon, come back and they had left the floor without getting to our room yet. They didn't come back until late. Very inconvenient. Sometimes we'd have to call for them to come clean. Pool is small for how big the hotel is. Oh on the plus side the valet guys were great! Car was there by the time we got downstairs and they had great recommendations and help with directions. Probably won't stay here again next time in Waikiki. Even on sale.",,Annika N,1,3.0

However, I experienced so many problems during my stay for 6 days. 1. the valet people takes a long time to get the car - sometimes, I had to wait for 20+ minutes. I ended up parking my car in a different garage a few times because I didn't want to deal with this hotel's parking 2. the front desk staff and guest service staff were untrained. They took my luggage tag saying that they were going to get my luggage delivered to my room. However, 40 minutes later, no luggage. I called the guest service several times - first few times, she didn't react...then after 3rd call, she finally reacted and told me that she found my luggage tag still sitting at the front desk. Then she tells me that it will take some time for the bell staff to deliver my luggage as they are understaffed and they have a long queue...so I ended up going downstairs to get my own luggage, as I was late to go to my cousin's wedding. It took literally 1.5 hours from the time I gave my luggage tag to when I was able to get my luggage (and I had to get it myself!). And on top of that, no apology from any of the staff. 3. I had the breakfast tickets due to my HHonor status, where I had the option to go to the restaurant or get some espresso drinks + food at the store.

We were created immediately and bell hop took our luggage. I checked-in and was given a slight upgrade.

The room was adequate and I enjoyed having the vanity and sink in the room in the room rather than in the bathroom. We were able to get showered and dressed more timely. The hotel is a short 6 minutes from the beach. There were many restaurants nearby. The pool was very clean, but is a bit small. There were some unruly children splashing everyone which was a bit annoying. The bar serves awesome drinks which are reasonably priced along with complimentary fruit infused water. I was a bit disappointed there was no snacks or tapas available at the pool bar. Unfortunately, the safe didn't work in the room. I informed the front desk, but chose to not have maintenance come to repair it. There was not an ice machine on my floor. I originally asked to be close to an ice machine, but I assume the ""upgraded"" room was not near an ice machine. The balcony was small, but clean and did provide an indirect view of the sea. I would not recommend anyone to utilize the Expedia desk. The woman seemed disoriented and overcharged us for excursions. The vendor at the helicopter ride informed us of the error and assisted in having it refunded. By the way, the excursions were awesome.

I say that because it was already a stressful time with a wedding and then having to cancel and book another honeymoon. Upon arrival we were excited, both of our first times in Hawaii. Upon checking in the woman at the desk didn't even greet me! NO aloha or anything...just a ""name?"" WOW!! I still smiled and told her our name. Explained this was our honeymoon etc. ""Oh, ok"" is all I got. The gentleman next to her working looked over at her screen while helping the couple who rode the shuttle from the airport with us and said ""shoot"" and then proceeds to tell that couple that they were upgraded to a King with an ocean view! So I asked about being upgraded and was told no. We finished and went to our room. Our king with a city view was clean but the view was horrendous! It looked like project/ghetto buildings all around! I started to cry just overwhelmed from everything. My husband went down to try and speak with someone but was told there was nothing they could do and that the other couple was upgraded because they were some kind of members. LIES..if that was true why did he even look at the woman who was helping us screen and say ""shoot"" because they probably had a double or something and he was going to give them the upgrade to king but with a city view NOT ocean. Listen, I know they're NOT obligated to upgrade us, BUT the woman not properly greeting us set the negative tone that I didn't appreciate. It would have been a great gesture to upgrade the newlyweds. The interaction from the woman at the desk was just unacceptable! I emailed Hilton while there and they said there was nothing they could do since I was still staying there. Whatever. Greeting guests in a positive, nice manner is customer service/hospitality 101. I guess not here. The rooftop was a nice area, pool was small. The last night we wanted to wash some clothes and there was only a few machines maybe a total of 4-5 and 1 washer and dryer that were broken. People were waiting and complaining. Ridiculous for a hotel this large to have such few machines and then some broken. We went across the street to a Laundromat and washed there with no wait.

They put us into a one bedroom suite on the 18th floor, with two queen size beds, a sitting area and a large bathroom. We required an accessible room as my mother is in a wheelchair and this was perfect for her. There was plenty of room for her to manoeuvre around with the wheelchair. The room was clean and tidy, the beds were comfy and there was plenty of space for us to put our luggage. The room had a kettle and a microwave, which came in very handy. The hotel itself is situated a block back from the beach, and there is a small shopping centre on the corner. It's very quiet but still in a fantastic location - you just need to walk through the International Marketplace and you are at the main drag of Waikiki Beach. The service was great; we didn't have a problem. There is also a $12 breakfast buffet.My only complaint would be that there is no room service available, but other than that I couldn't fault this hotel. There are also laundry facilities available which were a real lifesaver.If I was returning to Waikiki I would definitely stay here again.","Townsville, Australia","Felicity D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Townsville, Australia</strong>",8,4.0

This hotel opened around 1 year ago under the Hilton Garden Inn brand. I was shocked how dirty this hotel was. I booked a suite with what they list as a large private lānai (patio). This is one of the most expensive rooms in this hotel. The issues started with this hotel at check in. I used the app to check in and was sent a message that my room was ready and my app was a digital key, the instructions told me to go directly to my suite. Well there was an error on the app and the door would not open.. So off to the desk. The check in process was cold and argumentative. The agent told me I was checking in early and that is why the digital key did not work. I showed him the message the app sent me “Your Room is Ready”. He looked at me and just said I have to check. He gave me real keys and off the room 335. When I walked into the room I started to notice it was not very clean, the floor had shoe marks all over the tile floor. Then I looked at to the large private patio that was listed as the highlight of the room. I was shocked to find cigarette buts all over the chairs and ground. The tables were full of black dirt, along with bird crap all over the outdoor sofa. The patio was also in need of a power wash. How long was it like this? Trust me it was not something that happened overnight. It was a disgrace. I then started to look around the room to find food stuck to the back splash of the kitchenette, sticky soda like stains all over the sliding doors that separated the living spaces. Holes in the walls, urine stains around the toilet just and just a lack of basic cleaning for a hotel with the Hilton Garden Inn name on it. I took some photos and went back to the desk.. This time a nice young lady asked what she could do. I started to show her the photos and she took charge of the situation and asked if I would send the photos so she could show her management, I did text them to a number she provided. She was upset by the state of the room and started to look for a suite to move to into. She moved me to a suite on the 20th floor, this was a clear downgrade as the sitting room was tiny and you had to step over furniture to walk thru it. I know the room I booked was one of the largest suites and there was only 2 with the large patio. The balcony in the new suite was tiny and to get out the door you had to roll over the bed as it was so close to the sliding door. Now this room was cleaner but still I could find issues and there is a clear lack of care when cleaning a room. There was a nickel coin in plan sight under the bathroom vanity.. I guess they do not clean the floor between guest. I did get a voice mail on the hotel room phone from a front desk manager, and I later meet up with him to chat about the room. He was very apologetic and said it was not normal. Yet the amount of dirt on the table on the patio of the first suite was like that for a long time. I did bring up the fact that my new suite also had issues with cleanliness yet that was passed over by him. The manager told me I would be the topic of the next days staff stand up meeting. I found the wording odd, that “I” would be the topic not the state of the suite. I was never offered any type of compensation for my experience. To make matters worse they still charged me for the suite I booked after they had to downgrade me to a smaller suite. Nothing! Just a lot of talk and apologies. I was not going to make a big deal of my experience but my experience at check out put me over the edge. The same guy who gave me a hard time at check in asked me at check out “how was everything?”.. I replied “could have been a lot better and I wish I got the room I booked” he looked at me and said “sorry you did not like your first room” and then went on with the check out process. So this tells me I was not the topic of the meeting or I was the topic of the meeting and it was that I complained about the room. When heading out I stoped in the lobby bathroom (key access) and it was so very dirty. I have been a Hilton Diamond for over 12 years and have been in Hilton brands for thousands of nights all around the world. This hotel could be nice (yet more like a Hampton Inn) if they had a staff the cared. The simple things. Every issue was because of careless staff and a management team that do not walk the hotel and check it. Sad really. I did contact corp Hilton and they made things right and refunded the cost of my stay because Hilton Garden Inn has a ""Our Promise""""We promise to do whatever it takes to ensure you’re satisfied, or you don’t pay. You can count on us. GUARANTEED™. The Hilton Garden Inn Promise reflects our focus on hospitality and integrity. We are committed to providing an excellent hotel experience for every guest, every time."" Again sad the local hotel did not offer this and I had to go to the corp office.","Oahu, Hawaii","dcl80</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oahu, Hawaii</strong>",357,1.0

The rooms are much nicer appearing now that it has been renovated and taken over by Hilton (we stayed when it was Ohana as well). However, right off the bat they were very unaccommodating. I called the day prior to my arrival to request a room with a king bed. The gentleman on the phone ensured me that he would put the request in for me. However, upon arrival, my wife and I were given a room with 2 double beds. When we returned to the counter, they were ""sold out"" and were unable to offer us any other room. The next morning and the day after they also ensured us that they were ""sold out"" and could not change our room (and they were not very nice about it; so much for the perks of being an Hhonors gold elite member...). Our room was OK in regards to furnishings, but the decor was cheap (on par with other 3-star hotels). However, the walls are paper thin. We constantly heard the loud children and drunk folks roaming the hallway outside the door at all hours. You could also hear talking, phone conversations, and even cell phone alarm clock of the neighbors next-door -- paper thin walls! Furthermore, we constantly heard walking and a ""scratching"" noise above our room. Not a peaceful experience in the least bit. Also the elevators are TERRIBLE. One or more was/were broken the ENTIRE time and it was regularly a 5+ minute wait to catch one. On the way down, they are almost always full by the time they stop at your floor so its better just to take the stairs. If waiting in the lobby for a ride up, get ready to run to beat the other 20 or so folks waiting to get in as well. Not relaxing. The room was also not cleaned one day at all, and was cleaned around 6 pm another day. This was fine, just a heads up for those trying to plan around it. Overall, I would not recommend, although the renovations look nice and it is in Waikiki. I found the thin walls and the fact that they could not accommodate a request for a king bed which was made more than a day before arrival (especially because I was staying >1 week) to be big turn-offs. Would choose a different Hilton property or possibly one of the Hyatt properties that are in a similar price-range rather than choosing this crap hole.

Also fridge wasn't working, it wasn't cool at all. So had to call for maintenance which took 3 phone calls as no one answered the call! Maintenance came and ""fixed"" the fridge. It cooled down alright, a few hours later the drinks and fruit was frozen! Need to replace the fridge I think. You can't even adjust the temperature of fridge by yourself you have to call for maintenance to come! How silly!

One day forgot to re stock shampoo and body lotion or they would not restock cups in room so couldn't even enjoy the coffee.

This was a good hotel, with excellent staff and in a fantastic location. There are loads of restaurants, food outlets and shopping all around the hotel.... how ever we were disappointed as it did not live up to what we have experienced before. The lobby area and cafe/convenience store were great, our room was a real disappointment. There were two double beds for two of us... we were under the impression we had booked a queen bed and with two double beds (a double bed is pretty small for two people!!! ) in the room there wasn't much room for anything else. I asked at reception if they had bigger beds and they said as it was peak time there were no other rooms available.There was a microwave and coffee pod machine and small fridge but no utensils of any kind or plates, cups bowls etc. I would have thought if there was a microwave here would have been some forks and knives and plates at least also. Not even any drinking glasses or cups just 4 paper cups for the coffee machine that weren't even replenished until we asked. We went out and bought cups and bowls etc as we're staying for 8 nights.It was a small room and not ideal to stay in for this long when on holiday.Another thing, was there were 3 fire alarms that went off while we were there... the first two were false alarms and there was no fire on last one but a lot of water was pouring out through the side of the building. I know people around us were getting to the point where they weren't even coming out of their rooms by the third one as they were so used to them going off. The restaurant at on the ground floor was not a great experience either..... my partner got what the server recommended and for $29 received one piece of over cooked fish and 3 pieces of broccoli. I ordered the tortilla soup and this arrived Luke warm. We only went there once as it just wasn't worth it. Lucky there are plenty of other great food places around.Over all if your looking for a hotel in a great location hen stay here but don't expect a 'Hilton' or 5 star experience it is definitely a 3-3.5 star hotel","Christchurch, New Zealand","dionneb37</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Christchurch, New Zealand</strong>",26,3.0

We had a balcony but it was hard to sit out there since the view from our room was of the back of another hotel and some parking lot. The staff for the most part were very friendly and helpful. The pool was small and there was no pool bar. I found that disappointing because who doesn't want to be served a drink while you're sitting at a pool in Hawaii? Other than that, the location was pretty good. We walked to a lot of places nearby, took an Uber to the zoo and Diamond Head and rented a car for Hanauma Bay and the North Shore. We can't really imagine staying here again but then again we don't really know if we'd want to visit Waikiki again.",,Rohit P,1,3.0

This is a no frills hotel but very clean and updated. Just a street away from the beach. Walking distance to shops and restaurants. We noticed a launderette across the street which was very convenient for anyone staying longer then week. They had all the basic necessities. Within the hotel was a small restaurant and a convenient store open until 12AM. They have 4 elevators we never had to wait more then a few minutes to go up or down but they do require your room key to operate the elevator. They offered cold water in the lobby area and free coffee in the mornings. If you are a Starbucks addict it is just down the street (less then 10 minute walk). You also have a Keurig machine in your room. They provided local coffee or tea cups. The rooms in this hotel are very oddly shaped. As you walk in the door the first thing you see is the bathroom vanity and this is true for ALL rooms. We requested a 2 bed with a sofa room. Unfortunately the room we were given was so small that if the sofa bed was out no one could go to the bathroom because the bed blocked the path. Also if you sat on the sofa you had no way of watching TV because of the way the couch sat. If you wanted to watch the TV you had to place the chair from the patio on the door track half in and half out to be able to watch TV. We paid for the upgrade at the front desk so we quested a different room. We were shown 4 different rooms until we found one that worked for our needs. 1541 is a great room for anyone with a family 1 bedroom suite. Lots of storage space however no tub shower only. The room also has a microwave and small fridge. No view but we were willing to give that up for the space we needed.The pool area had lots of seating and had a cap of 24 people in the pool. No life guard so I'm sure they don't closely monitor the cap. They offered pool towels and cold water at the pool. Nothing fancy but nothing to complain about. The hotel provided floating rings and tubes. Although the pool is small we never felt it was too crowded.Self parking is not available. There is a parking lot you can pay by the hour or day across the street. There is free metered parking after 10PM. Valet parking is available. When you get your bill don't be surprised by the taxing. You will pay RM Transient Tax and Accommodations Tax and General Excise tax.

An engineer showed and took apart the conditioner and said they couldn't do anything more till the next day and they would send someone up with new keys and a room assignment for me. Later when the front desk guy showed up with keys and a luggage cart to assist me i learned the engineers go home at 12:30 am. and would not have the parts needed to fix. I understood and the room i got was smaller but i was exhausted and took the smaller room. The next am i called downstairs to change rooms again and without hesitation Sharon or Raquel immediately apologized and found me a nice room with a the same amenities as the first room and upgraded me to a main KOHIO street view. I'm not easy and i'm demanding so Hiliton Garden Inn Waikiki staff take this as my genuine thank you for you service when things go right or go wrong. You do a great job of helping me every step of the way from printing downstairs, changing rooms, changing my rooms cause i don't like the sun waking me up to finding some unique hole in the wall restaurant that locals love. I wish i got your name but i had to have laundry service on same day return and the tall young man called back the laundry service to return to pick up my laundry for same day service since i was just 5 minutes late. He knew they weren't far away and asked them to return for me. You all do a stellar job and if you can tell i've been coming back every few months and its cause of you all so dont change unless its improving cause i love telling people about your property and service.","Midway Island, Hawaii","LUVFUD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Midway Island, Hawaii</strong>",50,5.0

I'd prefer a chest of drawers for clothes storage, instead of one of the benches, but it's not a major inconvenience. The only change since my last stay was the opening of the restaurant. I received coupons for breakfast with my rate, so I ate breakfast in the restaurant each morning -- omelets made to order and the usual fare. It was good. The HoloHolo Café and Market also adjoins the lobby, also a plus. The staff members, maids, waitresses, and valet service were all very service oriented.

We moved to the Doubletree for our final 2 nights to enjoy the Ala Moana end for our remaining time. We arrived early, maybe 90 minutes before official check-in time, and were told that we were receiving an upgrade. (Note: I am not a huge fan of a “view” upgrade since I would rather have a nicer room). When I checked in on-line the day before, I had chosen a room in the same location but on the other side so our view would have been towards the city but we received one towards Diamond Head instead. It really didn’t matter since there were so many buildings in between that we mainly just saw buildings! The best view was on the walk from the elevator to the room and would have been the same for the original room? The room, #1866, was one of the smallest I’ve ever had in the USA; it was more like a European compact room. The bed took up most of the main part of the room. The sink was on the right when entering the room with the bathroom, which included a toilet and shower beyond a sliding door to the left. The ice bucket, Kleenex, and amenities were next to the sink with ample towels below on shelving. There was an area to hang clothes with a ledge on top and a safe below. There were no drawers, except in the bedside table, anywhere in the room. To summarize the right side of the room, walking from the entrance to the sliding glass door for the balcony, there was the sink area, then the closet, and then a small desk with the only chair in the room. The desk did have a small fridge below with a microwave as well. A Keurig coffee pot was also there. The balcony had 2 chairs and was about 10 by 3 feet with a view of the buildings and the adjacent vacant lot near the hotel. One could see the golf course to the left past the canal and a patch or two of water to the right between the buildings, but again, the best views and pictures were from the walkway near the elevator bank. On the left side of the narrow 2 foot path in the room was the bathroom and then a small space to access one side of the bed, then the bed, followed by another small space to access the other side of the bed and then the sliding glass door. There was very little room for any real movement. It was cramped to say the least! The bed was comfortable, but HGI no longer has its once trademark adjustable beds. The wifi worked fine but required signing back on several times a day. We supposedly received a higher speed as HiltonHonors members. We also receive complimentary breakfast which I would not have enjoyed for the regular $18.95 price per person. They were out of wheat bread 2 out of the 3 days we were there. For the price, there were very few choices: packaged sausage patties, bacon, frozen waffles, French toast sticks, scrambled eggs, potatoes, rice, and maybe one other thing. There were some bagels, English muffins, and white bread all 3 days. Juices and a coffee station were around the corner. There was also a large bowl of fresh fruit. To receive eggs made to order, there was a form to fill out. Choices for eggs (sunny side up, over easy, medium, or hard) and omelets (choice of onion, tomato, mushroom, bell pepper, jalapeno, spinach, bacon, ham, or mild cheddar cheese). Friendly service was the highlight for breakfast! The front desk was more robotic. The guy at check-in was great, friendly, and welcoming. We had AARP rate, which promotes 2 pm late checkout, but it is based on hotel’s discretion so really a misleading perk. I asked and was told 12:30 was best they could do and only because of our Diamond status! Not tip top customer service as a Diamond level guest would expect and DESERVE!Check-out was painless, bill was correct, and we checked out just after 11 am as we had changed our plans because of their attitude about late check-out. It all turned out for the best as we found a great place for lunch nearer the Doubletree, our next Waikiki destination.The air worked fine, sometimes too well and really cooled room off; it would shut off if balcony door was left open too long-good feature.Housekeeping was fantastic and cleaned room on both days we weren’t checking out within an hour or less after I requested while we took walks for lunch and sightseeing. Top notch here!In conclusion, we stayed here 3 nights and then 2 nights at the Doubletree about a mile away toward the Ala Moana Mall. The room at the Doubletree was a much better value for the money. It was almost 3 times the size and had a much larger balcony. The housekeeping staff and the cleanliness were the best aspects here. The cramped room, the robotic front-desk team, and the minimal, (overpriced for those who had to pay) breakfast were the shortcomings here. When we return, we will probably stay elsewhere for our nights on this end of Waikiki, but the Doubletree on the other end of Waikiki won us over","Orlando, Florida","BerlinG-ParisF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",897,4.0

That being said I booked a single room pretty cheaply and they upgraded me to a suite on the top floor with a view of the ocean. I highly recommend if you are a Hilton Honors Member with status to book your stay here. As usual with status they give you coupons for free breakfast. There is only one restaurant, Bonfire. You can also use your coupon at the attached store which has a small food counter. i did not try the food counter. As far as Bonfire for breakfast you have choices at the breakfast buffet. scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, fruit, cereal (from a container) - many choices including fruit loops for the kids. You can also ask your server for the kitchen to make you eggs or an omelet. They give you a paper to fill out and select choices which is nice. As far as the actual food i mentioned, everything was pretty tasty. I stayed for two weeks so I pretty much tried every combination of omelet and fried eggs possible. The pancakes were excellent, and they have a big container of macadamia nuts so I improvided and made myself macadamia covered pancakes every day with strawberries and blueberries. It was good. You never can go wrong with bacon. Since I ordered omelets or eggs custom, I never tried the scrambled eggs. I stayed for two weeks, so I did use the on-site laundry room. They sell detergent at the store downstairs and next door. $3 a wash and $3 to dry if I remember correctly. A bargain compared to taking it to get dry cleaned or have the hotel pick up your laundry and pay per piece. No problems with the laundry room. In and out.quick.As far as the suite, it was big and comfortable. It had a mini fridge which I used and it was very cold. As I mentioned there is a min store attached to the hotel that has food, wine and beer so I used the fridge for some of my purchases there. Also there is a big market next door in case you need things. All the rooms in the hotel are recently remodeled so the room itself was really clean and comfortable. the living room had a sofa, closets and a big balcony. There was an ocean view. The bathroom was big. No tub, just a rainshower. Water was hot. The sink was big. They give you lots of clean towels. The nice fluffy ones. The bed was a king and was very comfortable with big pillows and has a curtain that blocks out sunlight well in case you want to sleep in late. The bedroom also had a balcony with charis. Very nice.

So convenient. The bus stop heading towards Ala Moana, Honolulu downtown, Chinatown and Bishop Museum is just outside of Food Pantry. It does not charge the resort fee unlike the other hotels.Rooms are clean and very tastefully furnished. Everything was good.There is a gym which was good.The pool is more like a circular dipping pool and probably quite small if there were a few more people.

The room offered two double beds, but faced over a car park and into residential units. Nice TV, beds were comfortable and Hilton pillows amazing as always.Bathroom was nice, water pressure was mediocre. The room was serviced daily which was a nice surprise. I called down to get my car from Valet a few times during my visit and found them rude and ignorant. They didn't pay attention and became rude when you called them out on it. I didn't tip them once because of this. They also had a rather annoying way of locating vehicles in the parking lot half the hotel looks over - continuously pressing the key so the horn sounds until they find it. Given the sound reverberates from the surrounding buildings - I just wanted to throw something off the balcony at them. Crazy.Otherwise I had a nice stay here. Location is ok, a few blocks from the beach so its a bit of a walk. The on site restaurant has different prices online to in the restaurant (more expensive when you get there) so we didn't bother going.Towels at the pool were a nice to have, we took them to the beach and also by the pool the one time we frequented it. A lot of asian tourists at this hotel that preferred the beach over the pool, so it was generally busy in the water there. It mentioned there was a bar, but I never saw one?There is a nice convenience store in the lobby also, they even sell musubi.I found it expensive for what you got, not sure I would stay here again given the inconsistent service and poor view for the price paid.

There is no place in the front of the hotel to do this. You will have to drive to Walina St. Due to all the one-way streets, we had to turn into Kanekapolei St. and turn left onto Ala Wai Blvd and then take a left onto Walina St. and the Valet is on your right. There are no self-parking for this hotel. When we first checked in, we had some issues trying to combine our reservations since we booked our reservation with Hilton Honor points and on 3 different reservations. The lady at check-in seems to be confused on how to combine the reservations. It took about an hour before we were in our room. The room was very nice and clean with a balcony. The room has a microwave, a mini refrigerator and a keurig. The location was great and in the heart of Waikiki. There are a lot of places to eat and shop. One of our favorite places to eat and cheap is Marukame Udon and it is a short walk from the hotel, but it gets real busy at peak times. The beach is an easy walk from the hotel. Walking through the international market and then crossing the street on Kalakaua Ave and going through the Galleria. When we needed the car from the valet, they always had our car ready if you call ahead. So, I am please with the service, but I would prefer self-parking for convenience. Also, I think the cost of parking is a little excessive. In the morning, there are coffee and tea in the lobby area near the elevator and flavored water in the afternoon.At checkout, we had more issues with the reservation. Somehow, our last night reservation was changed from all points to points and cash and we had to go back and forth with the Hilton honor customer service representative and the manager of the hotel to resolve the balance on our bill. This took about 1.5 hours to resolve. Lucky we had a copy of our reservation for proof.I would have given it 5 stars if it weren’t for the check-in and checkout process and the valet fees.","Jacksonville, FL","nhumbc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jacksonville, FL</strong>",20,4.0

Staff is friendly and helpful. I think the double bed rooms could have the bathroom sink behind a door or at least a way to shield the sleeping area from the light, but this was a business trip and my companion was my wife.

We had the later half of our reservation rate lowered due to a rate drop on the Hilton website. Despite confirming this with the hotel clerk (Kia) and going through an extended phone conversation with the Hilton Honours toll free telephone number about their Rate Guarantee Policy, we didn't get the lower rate when we were checking out. The rate differential wasn't as much an issue as the principle of what the discussion went down with the hotel clerk Kia. Kia indicated that they cannot honour the lower rate minus 25% as per the Hilton Rate Guarantee Policy (which was understandable) but he can adjust to the lower rate. Kia distinctly mentioned that at the lower rate, there will be 2 holds on the credit card (which was fine) as an indication of the details of the discussion we had.At check out, the desk clerk didn't have this information. They indicated that they telephoned Kia and the discussion with me was denied. I guess I was accused of lying!!! Fortunately, I had a screen photo of the lower rate reservation (AAA rate). I requested the manager review this and he (Jacob) was even more unhelpful. Jacob checked my CAA (Canadian Automobile Association) membership card and questioned the validity and the reciprocal AAA policy. I went on to call my CAA/AAA toll free number and put them on the speakerphone before Jacob grudgingly gave me the lower rate. Jacob then asked me to re wait for the next available clerk to finish the check out process-I would imagine that any hotel manager can complete the checking out process. In total, between Kia and Jacob, I wasted at least an hour of valuable holiday time.I'm a Marriott Reward program member and uses their service frequently.The difference between my Marriott and Hilton experience is like night and day.I will think twice before doing any reservations with the Hilton chain in the future and would advise all my friends and colleagues against using the Hilton brand.","Ontario, Canada","premiedoc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ontario, Canada</strong>",6,1.0

All I saw was that it had a pool at the Hilton and looked ""nice"" when I booked. The hotel is in a nice area, and near the new fancy international mall. The hotel itself is lovely, and has a little shop in the base of it that has all sorts of stuff should you have forgotten anything. Super convenient when you've forgotten something and don't want to hike out to the local ABC when you've first arrived and don't know where anything is. We didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment about that, except we did check if they had a happy hour and they didn't. But there is a little bar in the front which does (odd location) - but it did have a happy hour!Staff at the hotel were amazing, and I mean everyone. Front staff were super knowledgable and every cleaning staff member always smiled. It seemed that everyone was happy to work at the hotel, which you don't often get! It was actually a really lovely surprise. The concierge was fabulous and booked a car for us super quickly. Heads up. I think one of the concierges also does represent a time-share with the Hilton, so if you don't want to sucked into that 7th circle of hell, don't sign up for a timeshare presentation. (I didn't go to one of the presentations, it's just my experience with other timeshare presentations!)Pool. It's small-ish but that's pretty much the norm for hotels in Waikiki. That being said, unless you're planning on doing laps, it's perfect! There are plenty of chairs, towel access is super easy, and there's a bar down there and a sitting area. The bartender was friendly, but just FYI, no happy hour.Our room was great… The shower was huge, and had killer water pressure! We had a little balcony that had two chairs on it which we used…we had an excellent view of the busy downtown area which was wonderful from the 11th floor in the evening. There's a fridge and even a microwave, and a coffee machine… But we never used the coffee machine as there was hot coffee in the lobby in the mornings. There are little paper cups for it, so if you wanted a larger caffeine hit, I would suggest getting a big mug from ABC. They also did serve decaf and had tea as well. Oh, and our room as also decorated in a cute modern style. Security. The elevator will only take you up to your floor if you use your room card to activate the elevator. This is true as well for the bathrooms by the pool area, and I don't think you can get access to the pool unless you have your card either to let you out on the third floor. Initially it's a pain in the butt, however it's a brilliant idea, as there are so many tourists in Waikiki, anyone could really just wander in. So the additional security measures were appreciated!So we would go back in a heart-beat. Hotel was in a perfect location, grocery store next door, the people lovely and room beautiful!

This was our first stay here and chances are, it will be the last. The hotel was refurbished and the only thing it has going for it is newness and that will wear off soon. We originally had a 2 bed room. there is minimal closet space - 7 hangers. why so important - because there are no dressers. there is a cushioned bench that you apparently put your suitcase on and live out of a suitcase for your stay. at the foot of each bed was another cushioned bench (without a back rest) and that was the only other place to sit aside from the bed. No desk, no table. We, like most others, brought in the small table from the balcony. the bathroom - not good. Granted, new but that is the highlight. Water pressure is low, no place to hang towels (so much for environmentally friendly). The towels are kept outside of the toilet and shower area - across the entranceway is the sink - basically open to the room. We were ""upgraded"" to a king room. No cushioned bench at the end of the bed because the room was too narrow. Again, no place to put your clothes. Disfunctional and uncomfortable design. Water pressure was still low. Fast internet was a plus. Our room included breakfast and the staff at the restaurant was wonderful! The only meal we ate there was breakfast. Location was good because the bus stop and trolley is at next corner. Pool is very small and faces Saks Fifth Avenue. NO HOT TUB! NO HAPPY HOUR! However, there seems to be a constant smell of smoke - as in BBQ. At the pool and in the hotel hall. About the valet - each time we got the car, the valet adjusted the seats, arm rest and would change the radio station. At one point, I thought I had left it with more gas than when I picked up the car. One morning, when headed back to a destination, the valet had programmed into MY gps a golf course. WHY? It was bad enough that these guys adjust your seats, arm rests and radio stations but now use MY personal GPS? Makes me wonder why every night on returning was asked, when I was coming to get the car? If doing laundry, easier and cheaper to go across the street to Ido. there are only 2 washers and 2 dryers at the hotel. too bad you can only use valet parking - that was the first time I didn't trust the valet guys.","Occoquan, Virginia","JerseyAJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Occoquan, Virginia</strong>",28,2.0

The Hilton Garden Inn was a pleasant surprise and overall a great stay. I just stayed there last week and I was given a corner room at the end and it was VERY SPACIOUS! 50"" Plasma Screen TV on the wall, 2 double beds, microwave and mini-refrigerator, with 2 long benches inside along with 2 nice size ottoman and a full Lani balcony. You might want to ask for a corner room! Very nice size for me. Another tip, if staying 5 days or less I personally wouldn't pay the $35 a day parking, we just parked in Waikiki, like a block or too over, read and follow the signs and you should be good! I think parking should be reduced or COMP for Diamond members, if we are business travelers and staying in Hilton Properties over 120 stays per year giving us free parking for 5-7 days will not make the hotel and property go broke! It's probably only 25% of guest who stay on a given week are Diamond or Lifetime Diamond members! Also Gold and Diamond members do get the free buffet and cook to order breakfast, but do realize after 3 or 4 days the menu doesn't change and it's the same crap! I wish the Food and Beverage manage could get more creative in that department. Even smaller hotels change up their breakfast menu! SMH! It's $19.00 per person and totally not worth that price, walk 2 blocks over to Duke's for an amazing breakfast for $1.00 less! Yes it's that great!Even though we had free breakfast on the 3rd day we asked was it the same crap and they said yes, so we just went over to Dukes.

We found this hotel to be a great value and fantastic location. The rooms were what you expect from a Hilton Garden Inn: clean and comfortable. What we really enjoyed was how quiet the room was. The hotel was at full capacity and we didn't hear anything outside of our room other than the occasional noisy guest walking down the hallway. Big plus. Maid service was excellent.We paid to eat the breakfast buffet at the restaurant located on property and it was good. There is a convenience store also attached to the Hilton, and we found this very handy. This store also had a coffee/smoothie bar which also served hot items (turkey sausage burrito was very good), pastries, and in the evening had beer on tap and wine. The store had everything from packaged meals to drinks to food to toiletries to souvenirs. Waikiki is a bustling place with every store you can imagine, and this hotel is located directly across the street from the newly-built mall International Market Place. Beautiful open air facility with shopping, restaurants, and almost daily musical entertainment. A quick stroll through this mall takes you right to the resorts located on the beach (Duke's, etc.). The pool on the roof of the third floor gets great sun. The beauty of this pool was you didn't have to fight for a chair like you do at some other resorts. There were always plenty available. The bar opens at 10 a.m., or so I was told. It was different nearly every day. It seemed anywhere from 10:10 to 10:30 a worker strolled in and spent the next 1/2 hour putting the bar together before it ever opened. Some bar staff were friendly, some barely seemed to have a pulse. And the drink prices seemed very high compared to most anywhere else I bought a drink in Waikiki. So we enjoyed our sun, usually bought one Coors Light (not bad for that one at $7 for a can) and then usually headed elsewhere to drink. Would I come back to this hotel? Definitely. We saved a lot of money staying one block away from the beach, and it was nice to have a comfortable, quiet room at night. I do hope they figure out that they can sell twice the alcohol at the pool bar if they'd just come down a bit on their mixed drink prices.",South Dakota,"Stenogurl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Dakota</strong>",54,4.0

Once you step through, you're in a small living room that had a sliding glass door onto a balcony. Through an interior sliding door, you have access to the bedroom and a large open closet space; the bedroom also has a sliding door that opens out to the same narrow balcony the other door opens onto.The room was comfortable and quiet; internet was fast and always on; air conditioning was easy to control and water temperature/pressure were fine. The shower was especially roomy and I appreciated the nice adjustable/modern head/controls in the new shower. Otherwise, furnishings and bedding were comparable to other Hilton Garden Inns.The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. They have a new full-service restaurant on-site; the decor was really cool there and atypical of standard food offerings at other Hilton Garden Inns. The breakfast spread was great with made-to-order items available from the kitchen too. Best bacon I've ever had at a Hilton Garden Inn :)The drinks at the restaurant were also good. Priced high like peer eateries on the street, but mixed well with special recipes and special infused liquors.Food at lunch/dinner was just OK. They try to be a bit upscale and eclectic, but they weren't able to completely pull it off with the dishes I tried. It was just average quality/taste wise. And a bit pricey.But for a large Hilton Garden Inn property in the heart of Waikiki, this was a nice hotel with nice options ...and footsteps away from anything you want to see/do in town.I would definitely consider it my mix of properties to stay at the next time I'm in Oahu.","Waikoloa, Hawaii","Michael_WorldWanders</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waikoloa, Hawaii</strong>",225,4.0

I am a Diamond member and even though I requested upgrade in comments section, when I arrived I was put into a really really small room. Bed with no room and most of all no table/desk & no balcony (even though I booked balcony room). I guess none of the rooms have what we would call a desk. Just a narrow, under the TV table with bench seat. I called down & they upgraded me to a 1 bedroom unit. Rooms are still small, especially if you are used to the older hotels that have decent sized rooms. Good feature is that they let you call down for the car (most hotels now require you to come down first) so the wait isn't too long if at all. The best about the hotel is if you are Honors member that gets the free breakfast, the buffet breakfast is excellent at the Fire Grill restaurant in lobby area. The service getting in is a problem but I'd expect the restaurant management to get their act together and make it better.

Its new and the beds are very comfortable. The beds are double beds so very spacious. Additionally, the location is right infront of the International Marketplace which is a newly opened shopping area with a lot of eateries with a Kona Coffeeshop right across the street. It is also not far from the Waikiki beach and all the action along the main area. There is also a grocery within the hotel with a casual bar and dining area. I don't think it's part of Hilton but it is within the grounds. The staff are great and friendly. My only bad experience was with a lady who checked us in. I felt she was just doing her job (similar to a robot). She checked me into a regular room even if I am a HHonors Gold member. I had to call the desk after checking in and Zach immediately transferred me to a better and slightly bigger room. Except for that lady, everyone in the reception was awesome and super helpful. The rooms are a bit small though and there are no special views (atleast where we stayed).

They are definitely working on fixing things, and the staff has been wonderful each time, but little things are still WIP, like missing laundry bags in the room, no luggage stand, minor issue with the check-in process, etc.As I said, it takes time for a new hotel to get up to speed, and its only been six months since they opened their doors, so all of these are understandable. They now have a functioning restaurant that serves all meals, and have a breakfast buffet which includes made to order omelettes. I did have my table cleaned while I was getting more food, and the seating arrangement can be a little award (some of the tables make seating very close to strangers), but again, all things that I'm sure will be worked out, and the food was good, overall, with great service (if somewhat overenthusiastic...). Even the lobby can be tricky to reach from the car drop off circle, which is to the side of the hotel and not the front.Overall, the hotel features a great location, right across from the new International Market in Waikiki, and good views.

After we told them about our previous airbnb, they were nice enough to give us complimentary drink vouchers for their pool bar, which was unnecessary but appreciated! As the beach was so close we didn't use the pool, but it looked nice and clean and not overly crowded.The room is simply decorated but clean and comfortable. It had everything we needed - the beds were comfortable, and there was heaps of luggage/closet space.

We checked for the room availability on occasion and we were met with smiles and unhindered assistance on every occasion.

This is a fantastic hotel. Close enough to walk to the beach, but yet far enough away from the hustle/bustle of Kalakaua Ave, which is the main drag through Waikiki.I'm very picky when it comes to room cleanliness, as I'm a borderline clean-freak LOL. I have to say that my room was always spotless after housekeeping did their thing. The hotel was refurbished within the past year, and it definitely shows! The room A/C worked great, which is very important when you're in Hawaii. Wi-fi was good. The Keurig machine, microwave and refrigerator worked great as well. The 47 inch wall mounted Samsung TV (with LOTS of TV channels) was the icing on the cake.My room was on the 16th floor facing Diamond Head. I couldn't see too much of the mountain, and just a small sliver of water, but I did have a great view of Kuhio Avenue. The International Marketplace is across the street, which has many dining and shopping options. There is also a small market just off of the lobby and a great full blown restaurant is on site, along with a self service laundry room that has 2 washers and 2 dryers. $3.00 to wash and $3.00 to dry per load. Parking is the standard ""valet only, $35 a night"" variety that is common throughout Waikiki. This is a fact of life over there - I've seen many reviews where folks complain about this, but good luck trying to find a place to park on your own if you want to save the money. The only down side was there was no desk or Ethernet ports in my room. This was not a big deal for me as I was able to work at the table and use my AirPort Express which utilized the hot-spot on my phone for Ethernet connectivity, as my work laptop does not allow Wi-Fi connectivity. Just thought I'd throw that out there if you absolutely needed the desk or Ethernet connection.The pool area was nice. There was a bar at the pool as well. Drink prices seemed to be average.I really enjoyed my stay at this Hilton property.

You can easily walk to the beach and there are a ton of restaurants and stores in the surrounding areas. I'm not a fan of the valet only parking but understand since it's quite cramped in the area! Valet was generally tolerable as long as you called valet earlier (they provide you a ticket with the extension number and an ID number). The rooms- I was able to see two since I switched once due to the lack of view (more on that later)- appeared nice but may differ in terms of large desk or standalone table. Walls can be a bit thin- one night I heard some sort of drilling and hammering past midnight, which stopped after I called the front desk to complain. On another night, I heard a couple have enthusiastic relations. Thankfully, did not last beyond that night!The lack of view was truly, truly terrible- there is another building nestled in the inner ""L"" of the building and my first room faced a blank building wall. After talking to the very friendly front staff, they relocated me to the 7th floor facing Walina St, so I had a view of some trees, a bit of the cityscape and the roof of food pantry.

I like firm mattresses but this was actually hard, the kind where you can feel there isn't enough padding between the springs and the top.... 5 days into our 12 night stay I got used to it and stopped waking up with a sore back. Onto the all the positives: we arrived on a 6am flight and were prepared to hit the streets until our 3pm check in but a room was available and they checked us in early without any extra fees, like Las Vegas charge - we were very happy; not sure what the hotel was before Hilton refurbished it and opened up in June 2016, but they have done a great job; my husband and I stayed in a 2 x double beds room which had ample space to move around in, a bench to place suit cases on, a wardrobe, large TV, heaps of electrical sockets including a USB charging point, a small round table for food/drinks/laptop, Neutrogena toiletries, very large shower and toilet behind a sliding door, large vanity area, in room safe, microwave, fridge, coffee maker with coffee sachets/pods, ice bucket (ice in the foyer) hairdryer, iron and ironing board. I could often smell a pleasant perfumed fragrance in the foyers, which I later discovered was one of the disinfectants the cleaners used - nice and fresh. Our room was on the 3rd floor which is where the pool is, I asked for a quiet room which it was, but the only downfall to that is the balcony faced the car park and another building so we didn't use it... no big deal as we were out for most of the day and enjoyed the cable TV when we got back. The pool area was a little larger than what the photos do justice and they had a bar, billiard/pool table, couches as well as sunbeds. The hotel also had a guest laundry (washer/dryer) which we used at a cost of $3 USD per load. Every morning the lobby was setup with free tea and coffee and late afternoon they would provide free chilled water which was infused with fruit - 3 options like lemon, lime and pineapple which was our favorite. The hotel had both a front and side entry point - the side offering a ramp for those with wheelchairs and prams, the front of the hotel which faced the International Market Place has stairs only. The hotel's restaurant 'TR Fire Grill' still wasn't ready when we left 2nd Dec, though appeared to be very close to finally opening. The hotel did however have a convenience store attached to its lobby with snacks/drinks/alcohol, souvenirs as well as a cafe that served various sweet and savory items, coffee etc. Across from the hotel was a Food Pantry which boasted a large grocery store, alcohol, fresh fruit/veg and meats as well as some ready made cooked hot items - upon entry there was also a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf cafe, an Asian sushi shop and one that prepared various hot meals which people often queued at . As mentioned the hotel's front, sits across from the newly built International Market Place (last time we were in Honolulu it was actually more like an open air market place, but now its an upscale semi enclosed building with Saks on 5th; Honolulu Cookies and other boutique stores, as well as a cafe at the front entrance called 'Kona Coffee Purveyors' which makes excellent coffee, has an onsite bakery with lots of yummy things and even sell glasses of wine); from here you can walk through to Kalakaua Ave which is considered the main shopping/restaurant strip. If you need to jump on a bus, there is a stop located on the corner opposite to the hotel and for example a $2 bus fare took us to Ala Moana Shopping Centre about 15 minutes away. Despite the hard mattress I would consider this hotel again if the price is right (the price was creeping up after it opened, so I may have been lucky booking it pre opening in June 16).","Melbourne, Australia","christinedS4625VU</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",125,4.0

It does not offer all the amenities of a full-blown Hawaiian resort, but offers just enough to make a an economical compromise. Totally re-modeled in a modern look. Great pool/patio/bar. Good restaurant. Excellent, friendly, and helpful staff! Truly a perfect economy compromise location. Directly across the street from the entrance to the new amazing ""International Market Mall"". Only one block walk (through the mall) to the main retail street. 2 Blocks to the beach. Connected to quite possibly the best little store in Waikiki, HoloHolo (see my other review). No self-parking, but the valet was always great. Good Wi-Fi. Great selection of computers (including a mac) to use in the lobby. Rooms are a little on the small side. Double beds in rooms can be tough for two people in the same bed. Bathroom/Shower is beautiful, but shower lacks much pressure. View can be from limited, to not much. Overall, if you need a resort on the beach, this isn't your place. If you need a very modern, clean, convenient location, with more than just all the basics, this is an excellent choice. i would stay here again in a heartbeat.

Other hotels in the area don't compare to the professionalism and comfort of this one. Easily the best hotel I have ever stayed in. They have a little fresh market downstairs that is everything. I went their literally every morning to grab a Kona coffee and pastry. They have everything you need and more. If you call ahead for vale I guarantee that they will have your car waiting for you when you go down and if you don't call ahead, you only have to wait maybe 5 minutes. Before you get to the front desk there are a few different varieties of fruit infused water that are delicious and refreshing.

This was our first time visiting beautiful Hawaii and this hotel was a perfect fit for our vacation. We chose this hotel because of the very reasonable room rate (there are no daily service charges like the other hotels) and it's central location. The hotel is new, clean, modern and never seemed busy or over crowded. Also, the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful, no issues here whatsoever. We stayed in a guest room with one king bed and a lanai on the 17th floor. We had lovely views of the mountains. The bed was very comfortable with lots of pillows options to choose from. Couldn't hear a sound from our neighbours or traffic in the hallway. A Keurig coffee machine with an assortment of k-cups, a microwave and fridge were included in the room. Kona coffee is available in the lobby for hotel guests from 6 a.m. each morning and cold pineapple water is available in the afternoon. A self-serve laundry is located on the 3rd floor and a 24 hour laundry mat is across the street. HoloHolo Market (closes at midnight) and TR Fire grill are connected to the hotel. There is valet parking only for $35 per day. We found most guests hiring a car at the hotel for a day to avoid the fee.The beautiful International Market Place is directly across the street. It's brand new with high street shops and restaurants. You can walk to Waikiki beach by walking through the mall which is about a 5-7 min walk. Marukame Udon is a block away from the hotel. We visited this popular noodle house in the morning for breakfast to avoid waiting in long lines. The Food Pantry is across the street which is uber convenient. The number 8 bus to Ala Moana Mall is right outside the door (it's a 15-20 min drive). The bus fair is $2.50 pp. I highly recommend booking Charlie's Taxi service airport transfers in advance for a flat rate of $29 each way. it's about a 25 - 45 min drive to the hotel.

The hotel has recently been renovated and the staff is generally professional and very helpful. I was upgraded to a city-view king on the 20th floor and it was a good-sized room with nice amenities. The only drawbacks were that the desk chair was not very comfortable for sitting at the desk and working on the computer and the lighting in the bathroom could use to be brighter. However, the hotel was clean and the bed was comfortable, so I was pleased with my choice of this property.The hotel has only recently opened its restaurant and as an HHonors Gold Member, they gave me coupons for free breakfast each day. The buffet had all of the items you might expect to find and they also would make omelets to order. They had only been open a few days, so there were some growing pains, but the food was good and the servers were all very nice.My only complaint revolves around the fact that I arranged for a 6:00 PM checkout on my last day since my flight home did not depart until 10:00 PM. The late checkout costs $105 plus tax, and I had arranged it the day prior at the front desk when they asked for my ID and reset my key. Imagine my surprise then when I returned to the room at 4:00 PM and first received a call from my wife at home who said that the hotel was looking for me. A moment later the hotel called me and asked where I was. I told them I had just arrived back in my room and I was asked if I knew that checkout was at noon. I told the person on the phone how I had arranged for late checkout and the hotel staff person then started quizzing me on who had made the arrangements, telling me that it had not been done properly. The person I was speaking with made it seem like it was my fault. I did not appreciate that. I was then assured that everything was ""ok"", but 20 minutes later housekeeping arrived to clean the ""vacant, dirty"" room. Then I discovered that my wireless internet no longer worked. It was very frustrating and seemed to me that I was being rushed out, despite having paid the additional charge.

Also across the street from the new International Marketplace, which has a number of restaurants. Plenty of restaurants, both cheap and pricey easily within walking distance. Beach is a couple of blocks away. Valet Parking only, so at $35/day, it is expensive to have a car. Rooms seem to be newly updated with comfy beds. As to the only negatives, this hotel is not ideally suited to guests coming for business, or for long stays. The fridge in the room barely keeps things cool with no freezer compartment. There is a microwave, which is nice. The biggest downside, though is that not all rooms have a desk. When coming for work, this is pretty much game stopper. There is only a bench and small table to work at with no nearby outlets (see photo). However, when I called and asked for a change, the front desk personnel promptly moved me to a room with a desk (maybe diamond status helped?). If heading here for business, make sure you request a room with a desk, but there is no guarantee according the staff. Still, as most people coming to the islands are looking for vacation and not report writing (I hope!), this might not be an issue and hence 4 stars.","Campbell, California","RKgobears</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Campbell, California</strong>",31,4.0

Nice buffet and coupon from hotel included 15% tip. Bathroom was very nice in room with large shower. Good size balcony on room. Hotel employees friendly and helpful. Lobby very nice & corner store handy and well stocked. Next store is grocery store with food court. Transportation with the Bus and trolley right out on street. CONS: As others have said the room is small. Didn't think could be that's,all but it is. Think our stateroom on a cruise ship was bigger! Had city view trying to save$$$ not a great view. Balcony chairs hard. No resort fee because this ain't no resort. Overall: OK. it's 3 stars not 4. More like a glorified Hampton Inn.

It was clean, convenient, welcoming (bright and open lounge area) and has a great view from higher stories, in particular. There is only a fair sized pool - but who goes to Hawaii for the pool anyway (!); there is also a very decent small cafe adjacent (restaurant not opened as yet at the time of our stay), and restaurants including some of the best on the island just footsteps from the entrance. For these reasons, I would give it a definite 5! But that is where my lauding of the place ends and the nightmare begins. My major qualm with the hotel was that they MARKEDLY confused the hotel rooms that I had booked for a group (including myself) and that I had not just double but triple and quadruple checked on to ensure that no such confusion happened. Despite all of my time and effort in doing so, they still royally (and I mean royally) messed up the room bookings including overbooking the rooms that were supposed to be clustered together - despite notations on the rooms not to do so on their system - and without informing anyone, put us in rooms with some of the worst locations possible. It basically required me spending around 2 hours of my vacation (more including the time spent booking and double checking on the rooms beforehand) trying to rebook these rooms with initial lack of help from front desk staff (who either seemed new or not well trained... confused about why the rooms had been overbooked), until a manager (I believe her name was Christina) showed up, actually rebooked the rooms correctly, placing a ""manager's hold"" (not sure why that didn't happen in the first place or some equivalent does not exist to forego this problem in the first place) on the rebooked rooms. We got a complimentary night and a nice room for the one night because of all the stress. I would just say really lovely hotel for convenience in location and the remainder of comments formerly but wouldn't return because of the nightmarish dealings with booking logistics, as they seem to not have a hold on handling large parties and/ or their staff need to have better communication/ training because their system of booking/ checking in is flawed.","Milford, Connecticut","Husker-heel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milford, Connecticut</strong>",29,2.0

Everything works, everything spanking new and clean, very nice shower. My room was tiny, even by Japanese hotel standards. Enough space for one person. Two people will bump into each other occasionally. More than two, even if a child, would be extremely awkward. Particularly unusual, again as others have noted, is NO desk, table, or workspace. Your laptop will have to be, well, on your lap in bed. This is probably the first time in almost 50 years of constant work travel that I have ever been in any hotel, at any price point, where there is no horizontal surface to work. Oddly, there is a terribly oversized padded luggage rack, that could easily have been replaced instead with a cheap, small table, although there would be no room for a corresponding chair. Again as others have noted, there are no drawers for storage of clothing, literally zero. The closet has two single horizontal shelves that could be used for this purpose, I guess, but they will be dusty very soon. The bathroom has no door, and a well-positioned mirror allows one occupant of the room to observe the other on the toilet!If you like Waikiki tourist attractions and a rather sadly narrow stretch of beach (I don't care for either), you are well-located, just one block from the water, McDonalds, Haagen-Daaz, etc. I would probably return to this property if traveling alone and staying for only one night in transit, as I was on this particular visit, due to the cleanliness and reasonably good value for money given the central location.

This was pretty frustrating considering my husband and I are gold members with Hilton. We learned later on in our stay that the hotel did not have our gold status on our reservation and we missed out on traditional benefits (water at checkin and complimentary breakfast) for the first several days. Finally, I reported that our room smelled of cigarette smoke--not everyday but intermittently--and the hotel did not offer alternative accommodations.

Our client asked us if we would recommend this hotel for their needs. NO. I will not stay again unless they fix some of this stuff.Tried to get a zero balance and person at front desk couldn't get within 10 minutes. Did ask to have a couple of corrections and they were when I got it off my account. Should have credited the underwhelming valet but didn't ask. Oh yeah on check out nothing like how was your stay.

We've been here for 4 nights so far, and have 3 more to go. We are very happy with our choice so far.After reading reviews on other hotels (and this one) we decided to stay here due to the updated and clean interior. Reading the negative reviews of this hotel, people need to realize what you're getting here. This is a hotel, NOT a beachside RESORT. It is in the middle of Waikiki, which is a very busy area and constantly has construction going on everywhere. Downtown Waikiki is all hotels, resorts, shopping, restaurants, and nightclubs. So it's going to be noisey. If you want something quieter, you need to stay outside of Waikiki. Or if you want a beachside resort, you need to pay the extra money to stay beachside with all the amenities that offers.With that being said, the Hilton Garden Inn is a great place to stay in Waikiki. The rooms are very modern and clean, not too much storage for clothes, nice bathrooms, and a little balcony. A small mini fridge and microwave are in the rooms for leftovers and such. Keep in mind, this is a hotel and not a villa. You're not getting a full kitchen here. At the end of the day, it's a room to sleep in while you go out exploring during the day and eat out at restaurants, which Waikiki has plenty of at all price ranges.TL;DR: Great place to stay in Waikiki. Nice clean, modern rooms. Close to beach, shops, and restaurants.

The room was very clean with a modern design. We received a 2 bedroom with full size beds (not Queens). The hotel was full so we could not switch to a king room with sofa (what we would have preferred). Bell hops are very nice and eager to give you any advice and help you with your bags. We had a small balcony which was very nice for morning coffee (Keurig coffee machine provided). The rooms are very small no drawers for clothes only a closet to hang a few things. We kept our luggage on the bench for the table and the floor by the bathroom (not ideal). The sheets felt a bit plastic-y so I would perspire easily. But the bed was comfortable besides the odd sheets. Maid service kept us with clean towels, clean room and were very nice in the hallways.The bathroom had only the shower and toilet but average size (very new and clean). The vanity and sink were in the hallway. Which is nice if you want to brush your teeth when someone is on the John. Must use room key to enter each floor on elevator. Not sure if this is a common thing but it was hard to scan and very frustrating. scan card + push floor number = hope it works.The market attached to the lobby had some food, souvenirs and a small deli. The deli also sold alcohol and had a nice happy hour. It made up for the restaurant not being open yet. If you are visiting Waikiki and love malls you are in the right place. There is shopping and restaurants in every direction. You are 2 blocks from the very busy beach and about a 40 min drive to many big attractions. We were heading out and got a rental to drive up North. The valet was not happy about us parking on the street in front just to load our car. We were not long and were not blocking any driveways.

From my understanding it opened in June this year under the Hilton banner. The restaurant on the ground floor is due to open soon and it just seems to be working through some final teething problems. For example they have a guest laundry on the second floor that has only 2 washing machines. This is a great idea, but with the number of guests they have you either need to wait for hours in the room to use them or come down at 4:00am to find an empty machine. My room had a full curtin, but no privacy curtain, so I had to choose between privacy or natural light. The curtains have automatic open/close functions, but I couldn't work out how to stop it part way. The rooms are fresh, well-appointed and up-to-date. I am sure the welcoming and obviously well-trained team will work out the kinks soon. The location is great with shopping and transportation close and handy.

It used to be the old Ohana West I think. I'm always skeptical of Waikiki hotels being ""refurbished"" as 50% only throw on a new coat of paint and others go all out and change EVERYTHING. Thank god the Garden Inn is the latter. Was very satisfied with the room, queen bed, wood decor and standard amenities with coffee maker, etc. Best of all my room faced Kuhio and they must have changed the windows and sliders because the noise from the early morning garbage trucks was fairly insulated. Check in very quick off the app and thank goodness as the hotel is quite large as well as the people in the lobby. Room was decent sized with queen be and some sort of bench. Linen was comfy and the bathroom had the standard Hilton amenities so no complaints.

The breakfast coupons allowed me to have a full buffet breakfast at Duke's (a short walk) or a breakfast sandwich or pastries in HOLO Cafe & Market which is connected to the Hilton Garden Inn. The flaky croissant at HOLO was amazing. The Hilton Garden Inn is centrally located to shopping, restaurants and bars. The beach was approximately 1.5 blocks away, if you cut thru the open air mall in front of the hotel. The room has a unique floor plan with a bench seat (no chairs) and table, The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The outside noise level was low. The bathroom had a nice frameless glass shower and granite top on the vanity. The room (1651) included a refrigerator and a safe. My overall experience was highly positive. I would consider staying here, during future trips to Honolulu.When I asked the front desk questions about how to get to Duke's, how the breakfast voucher worked and other basic questions, they did have clear answers. .Hopefully, they will improve with time.

We decided if it was opened when we came back this year that we'd check in and give it a go. I'm glad we did. They've done a great job revamping this hotel.We arrived from New Zealand after our flight was delayed by four hours and it was a relief to be able to check in early as our room was ready. Our room #640 was spacious (one of the bigger rooms from what I can gather from the hotel map). It had the bathroom at the far end of the room and not as you walk in, so we were happy about that. There is no desk in the room and we work even on vacation so in the end we brought the outside table in and used that. There is plenty of room for a desk so it's weird that there isn't one and I see from other reviews that people really do miss a work area. That's the only complaint I have really. The bed was comfortably, fridge not crowded with hotel drinks etc, the bathroom was modern and worked well. Staff were friendly and helpful. The lobby is lovely and has some modern touches and is furnished well with lots of seating. The pool is small, but has plenty of shadey spots and a variety of places to sit or lounge. The lifts are quick. The store attached is well stocked with fool options and all the essentials you need when away.Now that the International Market place is opened the hotel is nicely placed and close to everything.

The parking garage is off-site, valet parking only, $35 per day. The valet parking stand is on a side street, adjacent to the hotel and you have to make a block to access it from Kuhio, once you figure out where it is located.

There is a huge supermarket/bottle shop just across the road, which had everything I needed. Yes the hotel currently doesn't have a restaurant (I believe they are working on that) but you can get some snacks at the pool bar (get some drinks there too they are delicious). There is also a lot of construction going on across the road at the shopping mall, but that looked almost completed when I was there. So it does get quite noisy but I didn't really have much of a problem with it. The only time I did was when they decided to do some work at around midnight which kept me awake. But that was one night of my eight!The only issue I had was paying for the accommodation. Upon check in they take a portion of the nights you will be staying plus an amenities fee for each night (no bond required). I wasn't aware of this, and trying to get the front desk staff to walk me through this was difficult, and I speak English! They also weren't able to tell me how much I would owe on check out, until I checked out (I asked based on the assumption that I didn't charge anything to the room).So that was a little confusing to me, but we got there in the end. I would simply recommend to book and pay upfront.The only recommendation I would have for the Hilton is for there to be some form of crockery/cutlery in the rooms. There is a microwave in the room, it just made it difficult for me to eat anything from the microwave. Not that it was a huge problem, I went and purchased my own bowls/cutlery at the supermarket across the road.All in all I would definitely recommend staying and the Hilton Garden Inn, and if I was to come back to Waikiki I would stay here again.","San Francisco, California","Christie H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",7,4.0

The rooms near the elevator are awful if you are a light sleeper they have a loud ring anytime one of them stops on your floor so ask for a quiet room. The rooms are nicely appointed and the hotel is newly renovated. The pool has a BAR which is great but the need to advertise this more, however what the pool doesnt have is UMBRELLAS!!! They have a great pool, with an unknown bar, and no umbrellas, not a recipe for people knowing were to go or staying there. Please put some out there for shade it would make a world of difference. The gym is nonexistent except for a few treadmills and one set of weights so keep that in mind while visiting. Also they serve free coffee and tea in the lobby every morning and have a great on site cafe. As previously noted the Valet takes forever, also when you pull in they will take their time talking to each other and blatantly ignoring you so for $35 a day they may want to start looking at a new company or training to keep guests happy. Also housekeeping is very hit or miss, they always have carts blocking most of the hallways for a majority of the day but only occasionally made it to my room even if i was gone all day.Now location, location, location, this hotel does not charge a resort fee, which almost everyone else in Waikiki does so, grab the nice new towels on the third floor pool deck with no shade and after a quick walk through the newly opened international market you are starting at the Moana Surfrider, Outrigger, The Royal and Dukes! They are a quick walk and you can rent chairs for the day there at $40 but dont even think of going near another hotels pool, they are super strict. However the close proximity to all these great hotels, bars, and dining at a fraction of the cost make this location a no brainier. I truly believe with a few tweaks this could be a top notch hotel. It is not luxurious do not get me wrong but it is a good base if you want to get out to explore Oahu. You will not want to stay and play all day at this hotel so look else where if that is your goal.","Nashville, Tennessee","worldtravelling87</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",30,4.0

Give yourself 5 to 10 minutes to get your car in the morning and calling down doesn't make the process any faster. This is not your typical Hilton Garden Inn.

Provide or have a dispenser for detergent.2) Add cold/hot water dispenser on the floors where an ice machine is located, so guest will not have to go all the way down to the lobby in the mornings.3) Include plain water in the afternoon as an option. Leave water in the lobby until late evening as guest can check in during late hours. 4) Provide a clothes drying rack in the room for guest to hang their wet towel to reuse.5) Add a chair to the room. (There is bench seating, however, the table is round)6) Add a recycle paper bin to reuse the back side of paper, if guest chose to do so.

Probably not connected with the hotel, but can I just say what's up with the attitude of one of their cashiers?

There is a nice pool area with plenty of lounge chairs, but we opted to go to the beach everyday instead.There is a pantry type of a store near the lobby that sells similar items as the ABC store, which was handy. They are still working on the restaurant, but that's ok. There are MANY restaurant options all around Waikiki, so not to worry. There's an IHOP just down the road too within walking distance if you want breakfast. I knew the location before booking & it is handy to most shops & restaurants, but it is about a 15 minute walk to the beach near The Outrigger Reef Hotel where we like to rent umbrellas from the slightly cheaper Military stand & about a ten minute walk to the beach (Kuhio?) just out front of the Waikiki Marriott & Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel area where the wall protects swimmers from the big waves. If you don't mind a short daily walk, then you won't mind the location. If you prefer to step out & be at the beach in 5 minutes, then you may want to stay somewhere on Kalakaua Avenue, which is the street adjacent to the beach. All in all a very comfortable stay.

As a bonus, I have always felt an extra bit of effort from the staff as a honors member. Unfortunately, this is not the case as the HGI Waikiki. When we got to the hotel around 3pm, the front desk seemed incredibly under-staffed with two young ladies checking in guests and many other member (including a manager) standing around supervising. The whole process seemed a bit disorganized and we had people cut in front of us twice during the process. Once we got to the counter, our room was not ready. During past stays at Hilton properties, the staff would make sure they found an available room. We needed to adjust our plans in order to stay close to the property until it was ready. Once the room was ready, we were right next to the elevators on the 10th floor. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but the elevator bell (ding) is so loud you can hear it constantly from the room. The next morning, we went to take a shower and the shower would not work. Water would not transfer to the shower head from the faucet... The shower would work if you held the button down but the water pressure was extremely weak. After spending several days at a great non-Hilton property on Maui and having an excellent history with Hilton properties, this stay was very disappointing. A couple good notes on the property...

I slipped the front-desk gent a $20 and asked him whether he could do some magic as I would appreciate better room (I booked cheapest twin room). He found me a top-floor King deluxe with 100% sea view (frontal) which I appreciated. I was asked whether I needed any help with my luggage (which I did not given my 2-day only stay with Hand-luggage). RoomThe room was not very big (which is understandable given how much premium one pays in Waikiki for each sq ft). What I immediately did not like was the way room was organised - one basically walks through bathroom as one opens the front door. One the right hand side there is a sink and all toiletries, whilst through a slide-door on the left hand side one can access restroom and shower (not rain-fall shower). I like having a sink in the restroom and a proper hall and this is organisation of the room is a NO-NO in my view.I did like that there were plenty of electric sockets and USB ports to charge my devices - this is great and a big +++ in my view!I also liked that air-conditioning was working properly (which you would expect in a new hotel), and was not very loud.There was also a small balcony with a couple of seats overlooking the ocean (and a parking lot on the opposite side of the street) which was very nice. The bed was comfy and TV had plenty of channels.DiningThe hotel restaurant is not yet finished, so for breakfast (as a Hilton Diamond member) I was offered full-buffet vouchers for the DUKE's. I pounced on these, as I quite like Duke's and it is directly on Waikiki beach, which is excellent.I also visited the pool and the pool-side bar. The pool is ok-sized, though not deep enough and not really made for swimming - more for family fun I suppose. The pool-side bar though was disappointing. I had a couple of drink vouchers, but these could only be redeemed for a couple of different drinks or mai-tai (even though other drinks on the menu cost the same as mai-tai). It was also very disappointing to find out that the management is already trying to save money and the free drink for Diamond members are served in 8oz cups (whilst the same drink when ordered and payed for is served in 10oz cup) - same for beer, when redeemed via voucher you get 12oz whilst normally you get 16oz.LocationHotel is about 400 yards from the Waikiki beach and is really close to some good eateries and shopping opportunities. My favourite nearby is the Marukame Udon, cheap and really worth waiting in the queue for!OverallI would probably come here again, though this hotel does not have exec lounge, unlike Hilton Waikiki, to which it is similarly priced.

While we were not thrilled with construction sounds starting at 7:30am, 7 days a week, this shouldn't let that affect our total overall impression of our visit.)We selected this hotel based on location and to use Hilton points. They were very accommodating in letting us use points for some of our stay. The only problem was it was 2 separate registrations which was easily handled when we checked in.Thanks to other room tips for this hotel, we found using Charley's Taxi to/from the airport to be the way to go for only $29 each way.The room is very modern and contemporary. We found the sliding bathroom door to be ""different"" and enjoyed the large, walk-in shower stall. The sink outside the bathroom meant more than 1 person can get ready. We were disappointed that there weren't more towel hooks. There are only 2 small nubs on the walls in the bathroom. For a family of 4, this made drying towels difficult. Because the shower walls were glass, we couldn't hang towels over the shower. We did use the chairs on the small balcony to dry bathing suits and towels but had to make sure to anchor them down as were 11 floors up and it could get windy. One night, we pulled one of the metal chairs inside to use as a towel rack.The beds and pillows were comfortable. (Although I wish Hilton would switch to queen beds.)The room came with a small microwave and refrigerator (hidden within an armoire which hid the noises). There is a grocery store across the street we used to supply ourselves with snacks and breakfast (the onsite restaurant is under construction). We were offered 2 breakfast vouchers (family of 4) to a restaurant 1 block away from 6am-10am. We declined them and went for the Hilton points instead.There was one, wicker sitting chair that was somewhat comfortable. But the bench along the wall was very uncomfortable for sitting. So, it became the holding place for our luggage.The in-room safe was large enough to put all our valuables including a laptop!The location is fantastic!

One can go to cafe and get something using the voucher provided to Diamond and Gold members. The turkey bacon burrito at the store in the hotel is pretty tasty yet wouldn't pay $4.49 if had to come out of pocket. Fortunately, I have a voucher since I'm diamond. Seems that not all elevators are working which slows down the process of getting to room or leaving room. But it's not that bad. A gym without one elliptical machine is crazy to me. This is highly unusual based on my experience. Typically, ellipticals are used more frequently than treadmills. Also, I prefer running outside especially in Hawaii which is very picturesque. So, they should replace some of the treadmills with ellipticals. The absence of an elliptical will make me consider staying here again since the gym is important to me as I'm here for work and health oriented. Staff are friendly and rooms well designed for small room. A hotel room without a dresser is not my cup of tea especially if trying to attract business travelers on a long stay. This is what management should do to improve the experience: open the restaurant, put dressers in rooms under wall mounted tv. Is it necessary to have so much seating in the room? And lastly, ensure all elevators are operating and replace half of treadmills with ellipticals. If they make the changes then I would give them four stars.

I have stayed at many hotels. This was a trip I booked late and their wasn't many good options at a reasonable price. I knew the location cause I saw the construction last time I was here. Since it was a Hilton property I decided to give it a try.I checked in Saturday and after getting to my room I put some stuff in the safe. Unfortunately is wasn't working. I dial 0 and it rang and rang and rang ... After 20 or so rings I told the girl the problem and it was fixed before I got back.Sunday morning we wake up and try to use the shower but the shower head is broken. After that I try to call for the valet. I dial 0 again but this time it rings and no one answers. I go to the front desk and tell them about the phone and shower and they said they would check both.We return Sunday and shower is fixed but Monday and Wednesday same no answer when I dial 0 (Tuesday no problem). On Wednesday I ask for a manager and I'm told no one is available. I come back later and ask again ... No manager available. I question their customer .service with regards to addressing my issues and allowing me to speak to a manager. I finally get a manager who tells me he will address the issues.Thursday and Friday same issue with no one answering the phones. In addition when I get to valet it's a 20min wait every time.Friday I again voice my concerns to a girl at the front desk. She politely nods her head and states someone will look into it.

My great experience all started when I received military orders to Pearl Harbor for 2weeks and there were no more hotel rooms available on the base. The HGI was one of two hotels out in town that I could reach a live person and speak with them that day. Not only did they help me with a room but it was for the military per diem rate which helped a lot! Once I got there, I really enjoyed the stay. The room was very nice, modern and perfect size for me. Though I was there for a long stay they made sure to clean my room for me every day so once I was off of work I had a clean cozy room to come back to. Everyone greeted me and they were all very sweet especially the managers Melinda and Kip that helped me greatly with a little car and valet situation I had while staying there. They provided the most hospitable service and even gifted me for my troubles. Wonderful people!!!The hotel is in the middle of everything, which can be a short walk away. The beach is only two blocks away so have fun enjoying the sunsets as I did every evening. I can't wait to return. They really made me feel at home there.

My major complaint about this hotel is that it has very close proximity to a mall that is under construction and hotel management did not notify me in advance that construction would be going on during my stay. Given how close the property and hotel pool are to this mall, I think guests should have been notified. The noise was terrible and started as early as 7:48am even on the weekend. As a result I did not use the pool my entire stay, which was extremely disappointing for me as I was only there for an extended weekend.

I was never informed that this would be happening prior to checkin. I insisted the hold be released and my request was honored. But it required an argument to accomplish this. This is no way to start a vacation.2) Loud, intrusive construction going on across the street. Too noisy to deal with. Nothing could be done to improve this. The solution is stay at another hotel. This is a long-term construction project.3) Location is poor. It is a hike to the beach. The distance mentioned on the Hilton website is deceptive. You have to pass by all the homeless men & women to and from the beach.4) Housekeeping is inconsistent. My room was skipped 2 days in a row. This required me to inform the Front Desk Staff each time, and on both occasions the Front Desk Staff asked me in a very accusatory tone if I had the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the doorknob. Both times, no. The accusatory attitudes were unacceptable and seemed to always be there with particular Front Desk Staff.5) Towels seem to be in short supply. We had 3 people in our room (myself, my wife, and my daughter) and I continually had to request more towels. Of course, I had to wait a considerable amount of time for them, too.6) Shower drain continually clogged causing the bathroom to flood. This was mentioned to Engineering and never corrected.7) Questionable clientele floating through the hotel. The Hilton Garden Inn Waikiki is close to the homeless population center of Waikiki. The characters I saw walking around on the 9th floor were clearly not guests staying at the hotel. 8) Parking is a nightmare. There is no parking. Valet services were running me $40 per day, with tip. There is no parking on the streets other than metered parking with a 2-hour limit. 9) Garbage removal poor. I watched garbage pile up in front of the elevator daily. Mentioned to the Front Desk Staff and it was corrected. But why does a guest need to bring this to the attention of Staff? It should be handled routinely.10) Pool is murky and unclear. I went into it once and never went back. Too dirty, too murky. The pool deck is filthy. No cleaning is occurring on a regular basis.11) Exercise rooms. The photos on the website never matched what was actually available. The dried sweat all over the treadmills was enough to cause me to never use the room again. This hotel doesn't clean and maintain the Exercise Rooms. Again, brought to the attention of the Front Desk Staff.12) Every door is locked and requires a key card to access. The elevator, restrooms, and the exercise facilities because there are so many homeless people in the immediate area.13) Used condom was found outside my room. Again, the clientele at this hotel is unsavory.As a result, I can't recommend this hotel at all. The experience was awful. The hotel even provided us breakfast buffet vouchers to an equally awful restaurant.

The wifi is definitely faster than most hotels in this area.The issue i have with this place is, it being new (to Hilton) you can see they have tried to get it up and running without it actually being ready. Some rooms (like mine) have curtains that do not close completely ( i mean atleast 6 inches or more gap). You can only valet here which is fine if you can get your car in 5 minutes or less. They have such limited parking space that they use other parking spaces (sometimes a few blocks away) and this often results in greater than 10 minutes wait times. Hopefully this situation will change.The desk are a huge accident waiting to happen. The bottom ends are heavy and hanging on rollers to cover the cables.

We found this out the hard way after the stuff in our fridge got warm. The pool and bar area are very nice, but the drinks at the bar are outrageously overpriced. There is a pool table in the bar area as well. Towels and lounge chairs are supplied; towels can be taken to the beach per the front desk. Be prepared to hear the CONSTANT construction noise from across the street (until International Center is done, anyway). Jackhammers and beeping, back-up noises became the background music of our stay. I know this is out of the hotel's control, but you should be aware of this and probably ask for a room on a higher floor or facing away from the construction. We couldn't really hear it from our room.It is clear that this hotel had just opened the week before as some of the kinks were still being worked out. The front desk staff were all very polite and accommodating as they learned the ropes and figured things out. The restaurant was not open yet when we stayed, but there are PLENTY of other options in the area. If you are a Hilton Gold Honors member, you will get a voucher for breakfast upon check-in (the Duke's breakfast buffet option is a MUCH better choice and not a far walk).The only complaint that we had during our stay was the housekeeping. One day they didn't service our room at all and I spent a half hour at the front desk trying to get it straightened out. I was told they sent someone up right then, so we went to the pool and waited a while. Upon returning to our room it was STILL not serviced (now it was 3:00 PM). We went back to the front desk and waited some more. They eventually completed it, but never left new coffee or condiments or cups. I had to go down the hall and grab some more from the housekeeping cart. The housekeeping was hit-or-miss for the rest of the stay. Sometimes it was done by 10, sometimes not until 1:00. They would often not leave replacements for things like cups, towels, or coffee. Maybe it will get better over time.Overall it was a very nice stay. We ended up getting a really good rate since, when we booked, it was supposed to be opening day (they ended up opening a week prior). I look now and I'm not sure I would stay here at the current rates, but would definitely return if rates come down.","Califon, New Jersey","Michael S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Califon, New Jersey</strong>",7,4.0

Everything was quick and easy from checking in to checking out and I can really say that the rooms were spectacular.

They also have a lovely, kid friendly pool. I'm told that the hotel was newly renovated and recently opened. Now on to the bad. The first room we were given was infested with gnats! This is probably due to all the construction still being done on our floor (4th floor) and in the room next to us. We spent our first night fighting and killing gnats/flying bugs. Every time my husband killed one we thought it'd be the last one. Nope, it wasn't. We really didn't want to cause a problem but by the next day we were grossed out and couldn't take it anymore. We immediately let the front desk know. They offered to move our room but informed us we'd have to immediately get out of our current room because they had to get our room ""ready"" for other guest. This left us without a room and they didn't seem to care of the inconvenience considering we had young kids with us! We decided to take the kids to the pool and wait it out. The hotel took all of our luggage and belonging and put it up for us. They told us that around 3pm is when we could get another room. Keep in mind that we paid for this vacation/room that we don't have access to. Then 3pm turned into 4pm. It was after 4pm when we were finally given another room. Great right? Nope. Once we got to the 2nd room the door was already ajar and we were greeted by a cleaning lady. To make a long story short the room was not ready! Literally! The room had not been cleaned and it had no iron, no clock, no front room curtain and the TV remote had no batteries. The maid had no screwdriver so she could not put the batteries in the TV remote and we had to wait on maintenance to do it. My guess is that this newly renovated room had not been finished when it was given to us. While we waited on maintenance we also waited on the nice cleaning room lady to finish cleaning and bringing in all the missing room items. Did I mention we were on vacation and already paid for our room? Now here comes the kicker, once the maid and maintenance man were finally done, my husband and I were set to finally head to the beach with our kids but then we discovered that our room door's key lock/card reader was broken! The front desk could not get the key cards to work which meant there was a problem with the door card reader. Guess what? We had to wait on maintenance again! AND on top of that Jacob the manager informed us that the hotel ordered ""special"" curtains to cover the front window in our room but they hadn't yet arrived! Soooo, the door doesn't work in room #2 and there is NO front room curtain and yes anyone that walked by our room could peek in on us and our kids! Talk about uncomfortable! At this time we are frustrated. It's not fair that they've charged us for this mess! The kids were getting restless so I decided to take them to the beach and my husband offered to stay at the room while maintenance continued to try and fix the door/key card reader. My husband was told that they'd move us if maintenance could not fix the door. For hours my kids kept asking when daddy was coming to join us at the beach. He never made it. That's how long it took for the door to get fixed! On day 3 we got out and did tourist stuff and had fun at the beach. We had a good day until we got back to our room for the 2nd time (It was after 4pm mind you) and the room still had not been cleaned and had no clean towels after calling the front desk earlier that day to notify them of this the 1st time we returned around 2pm. Instead of calling again, my husband went to the front desk and asked for a new room if no one was coming anytime soon to clean ours. The front desk said ""they hadn't gotten around to it yet.” Our kids had sand everywhere and my daughter was quite itchy. We were then moved to a 3rd room. Yes a 3rd room. Day 4 was fine, no issue with our new room. I had a mysterious rash to appear, bummer, but I don’t think it was hotel related, or at least I hopped not. Day 5 had issues but I'm running out of typing space. **Update** We checked out of your hotel on 6/27/16 and we immediately headed to Las Vegas for the 2nd leg of our family vacation. So, imagine the horror when we discovered that most of our budget set aside for that part of the trip was gone because on 6/29/16 the Hilton decided to bill us a 2nd time! My husband has called you twice now and no one could explain the almost double what we already paid charge. He was told a manger would contact him and no one called us. He called again and was given a voicemail. Well it's been days now and still no one has contacted us about this mysterious charge that took place days after we checked out. Mind you we were already fully charged when we booked the hotel. We've since had to dispute the charge with our bank and you still have not called us back.","Dallas, United States","Juionn T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, United States</strong>",2,1.0

They people checking us in were very nice but had no clue what they were doing. A lot of back and forth on computers etc. Eventually got me checked in but think they screwed something up in the process as I had problems at checkout but more on that later. I had to remind the of Diamond member benefits etc. Was informed breakfast for Hilton Diamonds was at Dukes. I dont particularly care for Dukes breakfast buffet as I consider it a pretty run of the mill breakfast and it never changes.....never. It is however slightly better than most Hilton Garden Inn breakfast buffets and at least has a nice view. It is a bit of a hike over to Dukes so can be a bit annoying. We were upgraded to a partial ocean view room (partial is as good as it gets) in a ""quiet"" area. With the doors closed it was indeed pretty quiet but you really didnt want to be out on the balcony with all the construction going on. The room itself was new and modern but very cramped, we had two checked bags and barely could find a place to put them. We also didnt really care for the room layout with the vanity basically outside the toilet area and really felt like the room and vanity area were all in one room. The toilet and shower are in their own room with a slider door separating it from the rest of the room. I get that I am in Hawaii and shouldnt be spending too much time in my room but when I am in there it would be nice for it to be comfortable and functional. If you are there to do any work, good luck. There is just a bench that pulls out to sit on to work on what is kind of a desk. So, not very functional for a business traveler either. We were informed by the check in staff that the internet was problematic and that was definitely the case, it was very problematic.We do like the location as it is just one block over from the main Waikiki area and just a few blocks away from about anything but there is a lot of construction in the area and it can be loud and it starts early. We tried to go down to the pool one morning and there was no way we could stand to sit there as it was just too loud. The pool area is ok but the pool itself is not so big. The reason breakfast was at Dukes was because the restaurant was not done yet. We took a peak inside the construction area of the restaurant and it doesnt look like it will be done soon. The worst part is that they do not mention this on their web site. It would be important for people to know this as a part of their booking. We had a few other minor issues that the hotel did get fixed and most of the people working there are very friendly and seem eager to help and try but they have no leadership from people that know how things work.When checking out I was looking at my bill and the rate was wrong. I told the person checking my out and after several going back and forth's with someone ""in the back"" they couldnt get it figured out. I finally realized on my own that they were charging me for the free upgrade they gave me to the partial ocean view room. The ""manager"" that finally came out to discuss it was nice but really didnt seem to know anything about Hilton and the booking process. She started to inform me that since I used an AARP rate (on the Hilton site) that I had to be charged for the upgrade since 3rd party sites (I booked it on the Hilton site) dont earn benefits. I had to explain booking codes etc to her. She did finally fix it but I dont think she ever fully understood what was going on. What a mess.Finally, I just cant recommend anyone go there right now. If you are booking on Hilton points the other Hilton properties are definitely better value and even at a few bucks more you can better than the product they are offering right now. It is unfortunate as the location is good.","Centreville, Maryland","tim_21617</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Centreville, Maryland</strong>",212,2.0

Hotel will definitely want to update their website when the shopping center construction is done (my guess is Sept 2016).Details:Trepidation at checkin was my lead feeling on arrival at this newest HGI in Waikiki. The construction across the street was pretty much deafening and barely drowned out in what otherwise is a charming lobby with lots of inviting spaces to sit. Checkin staff was terrific, very friendly and at least made me feel welcome over the din. I had booked an upper floor partial ocean view ""quiet room,"" and headed to the elevators as the relentless jackhammers once again increased my trepidation.The elevators were many and efficient and I was quickly to the top of the hotel. The elevator landing is open air, and actually a nice view to the ocean, but not without the din of construction below. Fearing I was on the Kuhio Street side of the hotel, I happily discovered my room was instead on the side street.The room could be best described as cozy and stylish. And, as I closed the door the feeling of trepidation shifted to serene calm. My ""quiet room"" was exactly that, no sound of construction, and it was blissfully quiet all night long. The king bed was wonderfully comfortable, firm yet plush top, nice pillows. Towels had that new hotel softness that added nicely to a bit of an upscale feel. No cups or glasses in the room, just plastic and paper, and similarly the bath products were reminders you're in a mid-range hotel. The partial ocean view could also be called partial Diamond Head and partial Ala Wai views. From the small but usable lanai the ocean did indeed appear in spots between the buildings. From within the room the view was towards Diamond Head. For the location, that's a pretty good view.The pool deck is nicely laid out, with rows of loungers, nice size pool, and pool bar on a guest access only floor. Until construction across the street is done I did not and would not visit the pool - you may have a higher tolerance for jackhammers than I did. After construction quitting time it was a nice space but needs a little more decor/pizzazz at what felt like a very utilitarian bar. The location is an easy walk to the beach, and in the middle of Kuhio and it's cheap restaurants, bars, etc., and two blocks from tourist central Kalakaua. You can easily use this as your base to suit your tastes, simply go left out of the hotel and a block over to fancier restaurants and shops and the area I call ""Ginza-Waikiki,"" or go right for cheap eats and dive bars. Either choice is safe for walking and exploring, even take in the many sides of Waikiki. If I was in a lower priced, lower floor room, I would probably give the hotel 3 stars until construction is done. But if you do as I did and book a premium room, and if you plan more beach time than pool time, it is a solid 4 stars with room style reaching for 5 stars.","Austin, Texas","JDinAustin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",19,4.0

So, i now have to go to the beach and pay to lie on a chair as i cant go to the pool as i feel so uncomfortable.

It is a very nice place to stay. Only one thing left to do this the restaurant next door. However there is a cafe type place along with a store attached to the hotel that had a lot of stuff to offer. The staff was excellent at all times. The bell folks included as well as the parking staff. The parking is strictly valet which cost but does have in and out privileges - just let them know that. Fee is added to your bill. Rooms are very nice and comfortable - very modern in style. I had a special business rate so my room did not have a good view - another building behind hotel - but it was OK - no time for sitting outside on patio anyway.Walk to all main areas - two streets or less from beach and many food places. I would recommend this hotel for anyone staying in the area that needs a moderate budget.,"San Diego, California","Dave B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",14,4.0

We were graciously welcomed by the staff and management and were asked to stay for the official blessing ceremony. What an experience! Our stay was excellent, the accomodations were superb and the customer service was top notch! We will definitely be staying again!
