I've lived in cinder-block military barracks, and I've lived in an old building in San Francisco. Like the SF apartment, it's close to natural beauty. One of the reasons I chose the Ewa between the lower-cost hotels is that instead of window air-conditioning units; noise right over the bed, the Ewa has quieter units, and they work well. The other reason is proximity to Waikiki Wall / Queen's Beach. The cleaning staff is excellent and pro-active about removing wet towels to keep humidity down. One disappointment - the roof deck is not handicap accessible - the elevator stops the floor below. During our stay, the other guests were friendly and the staff was excellent.

With having the feeling that this isn’t important to them I checked out and reported to the gentleman in the front.

First stay found us in a clean and comfortable room with lanai. Staff friendly. However, lift was broken for 1 day which meant carrying our bags up 4 flights of stairs.Return visit we were placed in a very small room adjacent to lift - part of an adjoining suite I assume as there was a locked door in room and we could hear the voices and TV of next room. Felt very uncomfortable with little walking space and one partner had to get out of bed by climbing to the end of bed as it was against the wall. Tap on bathroom basin faulty and we worried we might be held accountable if it completely failed. Not acceptable. We requested another room and the staff obliged.Our biggest problem was the $15.00 per day service fee which includes US Today (overseas visitors have no topical interest in this paper), water in the foyer (why would you bother sitting in a small foyer to drink water), replenish coffee in room daily (this is normally a part of motel service and the coffee sachets only allow for 2 cups a day), shuttle to Ala Moana shops which one would only use once in a short stay of 3 days and local phone calls which most US motels provide as a part of room costing. This fee also allows for Internet access and in room safe which most motels provide free of charge anyway and additional inclusions (whatever that means). One has to pay this fee but in my opinion it is a form of ""made up greed"" for more money.An old motel but clean and tidy overall.","Batehaven, Australia","Nomadgirl1946</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Batehaven, Australia</strong>",6,3.0

Excellent service. Staff was pleasant and friendly and went the extra mile to accommodate a special request. They made sure to keep rooms clean and fresh.3. Reasonable rates. They claim to be a 2-star category hotel and rightly so. You’ll get one of the cheapest prices here. But I recommend not to expect much. 4. Needs a huge renovation. Everything about the hotel is dated and needs to be replaced. While everything was in working order, it is obvious that Father Time has taken its toll. They are aware of this and I was told that they are just waiting for their turn to be renovated as other hotels in the chain are listed ahead.5. This hotel will really enable you to save. Apart from the great rates, there are kitchenettes where guests can prepare their own food. I found this useful for breakfast. I microwaved oatmeal daily and saved money on buying breakfast (please note that the hotel does not provide breakfast).

Pros: Price (relative to other places in Waikiki), location (short walk to the beach and pretty easy access by car to other nearby sights). Comfortable beds. In-room fridge was handy. Lots of eating options nearby for all budgets. Our room was on the seventh floor and we enjoyed a quiet, undisturbed stay. No lanai but could catch a glimpse of the ocean from the window which was unexpected. Front desk staff helpful and friendly.Cons: Yes, it's an older property but seems well maintained. The one elevator is old and slow, but better than nothing ... just be prepared to wait. Parking is nearly non-existent and expensive (par for the course in Waikiki). Of those that do exist, the spaces are very tight and hard to get into. We felt lucky to find the Ewa and I must say I've spent more for lesser places in previous trips to Waikiki.","Denver, Colorado","SFcatamount</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",98,3.0

We figured we would probably be up late dining and shopping, and up early the next morning to catch our flight so we didnt need anything fancy. Based on reviews and price, I chose the Ewa Hotel. I am so glad I did. I have stayed in the Aqua brand of hotels in the past and always found them to be clean, well located, and good value for the money. This trip was no different. We arrived early, around 11:45 am, and as I expected, our room was not ready. Not a problem, the desk clerk took our bags and locked them up securely and told us to check back around 2 pm and we should have your room ready then. We walked around Waikiki for a bit, did some shopping, ate lunch, (see my California Pizza Kitchen review), then headed back to the hotel. At this point, our room was ready. We were told that since I was an A-Lister, we were being upgraded to a one bedroom suite instead of the least expensive studio I had reserved. What a nice surprise! The room was huge, with three beds, separate bedrooom, and huge connecting balcony. After we unpacked, someone from the front desk even came up to our room with bottled water and cookies. The staff here is amazing. Always smiling and willing to help. And all this for about $100 and a free upgrade. The hotel itself is on the older side, and its been awhile since a renovation. But it was clean and functional. Its on the Diamond Head side of Waikiki, which I prefer since it is a little quieter down there. Plus you are a quick walk to the park and away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. But its also only a five minute walk the other direction to either the beach or all the commotion of Waikiki. Great location in my opinion. It is a low rise hotel, dwarfed by the high rises around it. If you want to stay in your room and look at the view, you might want to go elsewhere. But we walked five minutes to the beach and enjoyed the view from there and saved several hundred dollars. The beds were comfortable, the mini fridge was great, all in all a clean although dated room.The bathroom could have used some improvements. Remember this is a budget hotel, though. But there were cracks in the porcelain sink, the shower curtain was off a little, but nothing that stopped it from being functional. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.","Cascade Park, Washington","TravellinDad909799</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cascade Park, Washington</strong>",25,4.0

There were several nice touches:two walk in closets. One has an ironing board and iron, the other has a set of dishes and silverware.Kitchenette including microwave, range, sink and refrigerator. I made use of this, storing take-out meals in the refrigerator and reheating them in the microwave. The dishes in the closet came in handy.Radio alarm clock.

With the same (even lower) per night rate as other Waikiki hotels, I got a really large one-bedroom suite at Ewa. The bedroom alone is bigger than a more expensive hotel I stayed last year two blocks away.2. Super friendly staff. The front desk guy and the housekeeping lady were very helpful.3. It has everything we needed. mini fridge, microwave, coffee machine, iron, stove top, etc. TV and AC worked fine.Cons:1. The building is SO OLD. everything looks crappy. I would say it is the worst looking hotel I've ever stayed in the US. the elevator was slow, shaky, and smelly.2. The room was dirty. The floor seems never been vacuumed. Hairs from previous guest in the bathroom, gross!3. WIFI is very unstable.4. Noisy. Tour groups come and go all the time. You will hear them talking extremely loud.5. You can hear EVERYTHING from next door. I mean, EVERYTHING. So embarrassing.Tips:The elevator only goes to the 7th floor. If they give you a room at 8th floor, you'll have to walk all your luggages upstairs. Also, the 8th floor suite does not appear as the web pictures. There's only sofa bed in it.I would not say Ewa is bad, but if I'm not so short on money next time, I definitely won't stay here again.",,yaof2015,19,3.0

The only reasons it didn't get one star is that I saw no bugs and the bed was comfortable. Other than that, Ewa Hotel is a shitbox. The room was tiny, which isn't a huge deal, but there was no closet or even a rack on which to hang clothing! We were in Honolulu for a wedding, so we wanted to hang up our clothes to keep them fresh and wrinkle-free. Nope. The room doesn't even have an iron. I called and asked for one and was brought an iron and ironing board, but no closet, rack, or iron in the room was kind of odd. We were out of the hotel by 8 am on our first morning and when we got back at 2:00 pm, the room had not yet been cleaned, despite having the ""please clean our room"" sign hanging on the door. We retuned to the room for about an hour and the toilet became clogged, but we figured housekeeping would take care of that when they cleaned our room. It was never cleaned, even when we left the room (for the wedding) a little before 3 pm and didn't return until after midnight. It was late and we were tired, so we got ready for bed. I turned on the TV and wasn't able to change the volume or the channel and couldn't turn it off. Our toilet was still clogged and the smoke alarm in our room started beeping LOUDLY! I called the front desk and a maintenance man came up about 15 minutes later to change the batteries in the smoke alarm. He also handed me a plunger wrapped in a garbage bag. I had to plunge the toilet myself! Mercifully, I had gotten the TV to turn off but was afraid to turn it back on in case the remote got stuck again and I had to endure the TV noise all night.","Kapaa, Hawaii","alohagirl59</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kapaa, Hawaii</strong>",9,2.0

Room cost me about $122. However the resort charges of $13 + ""Resort Fee."" I find this to be offensive because basically it's just a price increase that they don't advertise. Setting the resort fee aside the room was adequate. The bed was comfortable. There was a headboard with two fairly sturdy post coming off of each side. I was upgraded to a kitchenette which was a sink with a two burner stove. There was also a mini refrigerator, microwave, toaster and coffee maker. They provided some dishes including a very small saucepan and frying pan. So it would be possible to fix yourself a meal. I did not so I cannot comment on how well things work. The room had a small flat screen TV which provided good picture quality. There was a PlayStation 3 which doubled as a DVD player. They had a DVD kiosk in the lobby. I did not use it so I cannot comment on the selection of movies. This was part of the resort fee so they provided a card that you could use to check out the movies at no additional cost. The room also had an in-room safe, ironing board, iron and hair dryer. Over all the furnishings and carpet were dated but clean. Room size was good. There was a very small table with two chairs to eat on, and a relatively comfortable sitting chair. Bathroom had a very shallow tub / shower enclosure. The fixtures were definitely dated but the water was hot. They did provide soap, so called conditioning shampoo and lotion. These would rate at the very low end of quality for hotel amenities.Air conditioning was an older split system which worked well.The location is on one of the side streets in Waikiki. It is about a block from the Honolulu Zoo and 3 block from the beach. Overall the location is good. It was relatively quiet. However there was absolutely no view. Only one small window in the room which faced another building.The building has WiFi . On this day it wasn't working particularly well, so the management waived the resort fee.The hotel charges $25 a night for parking. This is pretty common in Waikiki. However I refuse to pay it. You can park on the Ala Wai for free if you don't mind a several block walk. However, if you choose this option be sure to move your car on Monday and Friday mornings between 8:30 and 11:30.

Comfortable bed. TV, safe and fridge in the room.Complimentary shuttle (you have to go to a hotel around the corner to be picked up) to Ala Moana.Cons:Convenience fee – advertised as $13 per night for 1 DVD/game rental a night, room wifi (connection not reliable), shuttle to Ala Moana (great if you’re not in a rush to get there as it stops at several other hotels and timings are a bit sporadic), daily sachet of coffee in the room (what about tea drinkers?!), daily newspaper… However, my booking confirmation showed that I only needed to pay an additional $45.29 for my 5 nights and I even e-mailed the agent before my trip to confirm this was all I needed to pay. They confirmed this directly with the hotel but once I got there the hotel asked for $52.35 (yes it’s still lower than the $13 per night but since I could have happily done without all the extras, it’s the principle) and I couldn’t have checked in without paying it. I did e-mail the agent while there who to their credit were prompt to act but they were told by the hotel manager that the $45.29 did not include tax – hmmm, the max tax a company can charge in Hawaii is 4.712% so that makes no sense either…(plus when I checked out the bill showed the daily convenience fee as $10 plus tax of 4.712%, so 0.47).Housekeeping – the room wasn’t as clean as it could be. There was a small pile of sand in the bathroom along the edge of the bathtub when I checked in and it was still there when I left. The toilet seat had a ""stain"" which I had to clean off before using. The fridge and wash basin area (the wash basin is outside the bathroom) had ants wandering about, when I pointed this out to the person who came to replace my bedside lamp lightbulb on day one, he proceeded to squash them with his fingers and then pointed out that the last resident had spilled coffee over the fridge (where the electric cafetiere was) and it hadn’t been cleaned properly.I had a room on the 8th floor and the lift only went up to the 7th then you have to climb up the fire escape stairs to the top floor. This is not a major issue but should be highlighted to anyone who may have issues climbing stairs.I would have rated the hotel 3 out of 5 however having a stranger wake you up at 3am on your last night by walking into your room through the door from the interconnecting room, which should have been locked, not a pleasant experience. Now when I first arrived in the room I did check that door to see if I could get into the other room and while my side could open, the other one was locked. I still put the luggage rack with my case against that door at night and it’s a good thing I did as the person shoving the door open knocked that over and that woke me up. Apparently they had just checked in and was wondering what was through that door. Anyway, when I phoned the reception to ask if they had the key to the door (it wasn’t a simple turn a lock from my side) they said hadn’t housekeeping locked the door, to which I replied someone just walked through!","Liverpool, United Kingdom","ScouseOriental</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liverpool, United Kingdom</strong>",51,2.0

The pictures on the web site are outstanding, however that's not what you get. Upon arrival the only stall that was available for parking was the handicap stall which for me was ok, since I am disabled. Check in was wonderful, Tracy at the front desk was friendly and said we didn't need to pay the $25 a night parking fee since we had handicap parking but that it was on a first come first serve bases.After checking in we went to our room which was very disappointing and sad looking. There was trash left in the dresser and a bag of trash in the closet, the additional room in our 2 bedroom suite w/kitchenette was actually a one bedroom room that was adjoining which they forgot to unlock the door to. Traveling with kids, expected one entrance to room so I wouldn't need to worry about an additional door.Went downstairs to talk with check in staff. He said he was sorry and would send someone up to help us.So a wonderful worker named Marc came to take out the trash and open the room, he was very understanding and kind. Upon opening the room, we were all blown away with the smell! The room had a musty wet mold smell which was horrible, allergies acted up immediately on 3 of the kids. Went down stairs to see if we could move rooms due to the condition of the room and was told that they were booked but they would remove the $13 a night convenience fee. Told Tracy that I would like to speak with manager, but he wasn't in yet. Explained to him that I was very disappointed with the room and that the mold is a health issue. Since there were no other available rooms and also rooms at other hotels were not available, me & my 5 kids (on the competition team) turned the ac on high and had to suck it up.Upon return from dinner, we found a box of chocolates and a bottle of apple cider waiting for us on the dresser. Of course that made the children happy and I am grateful for that since it brighten there night.I did make it very clear to Tracy that I was very upset with the price I paid for such a dump (mold smell in room, trash in room, mold in shower, mold on bathroom mirror, broken shower handle, and simply the room looking so dingy - this was not worth $700). He said he would speak with his manager and I told him I would appreciate that and he would see what they came up with at check out.Upon check out, the clerk was rude and cocky. When I asked him what type of arrangements would be made to my bill he said ""oh yeh! we not going charge you for parking."" I tried to explain to him that I wasn't being charged for parking due to parking in the disabled spot. He said, ""yeh! I know, but you was supposed to move so as what we not going charge you for."" I again tried to explain to him that I was told that I wouldn't need to pay to park there and he insisted that I refused to move my car and they were helping me out by not charging me. Since we had a competition to get to and I felt he was not understanding what I was trying to say that I would just leave, obviously a waste of time to talk to someone who is dead set in getting his way.What I actually expected was that the GM would have said due to the mold smell in your room that was confirmed with our employee Marc who had to open the door to the adjacent room for you folks and since we were not able to move you to another room we would comp the second night of your stay and that we are truly sorry for the inconvenience. Not worth the money or the cocky attitude of morning staff. Please remember that our check in staff Tracy & the gentleman he sent to help us in the room Marc were very kind and understanding. But, as always it just takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch.","Kalaheo, Hawaii","lawaivalley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kalaheo, Hawaii</strong>",0,2.0

We just found low budget Ewa Hotel online within walking distance from the beach and just walked in asking for a last minute 7 nights booking. The young front desk lady was very helpful and understanding. She found us a solution within our budget but we have to switch room once during our stay - totally fine with us. We parked our car either at the zoo during the day or on Kapahulu Ave - a block away from the hotel - at night for free. Ewa Hotel has parking onsite too at extra cost. Some rooms haves mall kitchenettes while others only have microwave, coffee pot, utensils and minibar. The room was cleaned daily. There is a rooftop as well - it doesn't have a great view but it's good to relax or sunbath with chairs provided. You can rent movies with the kiosk machine in the lobby - included in your hotel fee. I find the movie selection is quite up to date. Hotel ground is very clean. Walking distance to lots of good restaurants and convenience stores. They provide free round trip shuttle to Ala Moana Blvd as well - pick up location is another hotel around the corner. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Helped me store my long kayak in the locked recycle bottles area for one night. Oh they have locked cage for surf boards in the parking lot as well but my kayak wouldn't fit in. Helped me print a document at no charge. Also stored our luggages so we didn't have to bring them around on our last day while waiting for our flight. Good experience overall",,helenan2016,37,4.0

Very helpful and friendly. Great location and price for waikiki strip.We were allowed to check in 4 hours early. However...The hotel is in serious need of repair and TLC. The rest of my review will be about the negatives.Long Version:This is not a 2 start hotel, it is a zero star. Think of a motel 6 or a random $30/n highway motel. That's what you are going to get at Ewa Hotel in Waikiki.We purchased the 1BR suite. It was on the 3rd floor, facing northeast (road side). Upon Arrival, these were broken: both sinks, toilet, shower, stove area, and the ps3. As an example, the stove was not grounded! Only the major items were repaired (took 4 hours). But this did not hinder us to much, as we only slept and cooked in the hotel. The staff have their hands tied.The largest problem were the windows. Occupants smoke in the courtyard and it goes straight into the room 24/7. The windows are not tinted, which allows anyone walking on the street or in another hotel to see right into the room. Lastly, the noise! You will hear a garbage truck three times a day... right next to your head. You will will hear street conversations clear as day. Try having a two year old take a nap. The next painful item was the 'kitchenette"". Imagine cooking with out any counter space, washing dishes with one mini sink, a mini fridge that cannot hold a half gallon of milk, and almost no light. You pay a daily resort fee for internet access. When it worked...the speed was under 1megabit.Bottom line: We had a great time, but only outside the hotel.","Salem, Oregon","Rukiftw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salem, Oregon</strong>",1,3.0

Our room had a very practical kitchenette (2 stoves, complete cutlery, dishes, pans and pots), in which we cooked breakfast and some dinners.

This was a terrible hotel.First, the pictures online are NOT what you get. This place was an absolute dump.

This should be translated to = someone has cooked in your room and the stench will be terrible. We had to leave the windows open at all times and the smell was still there. - The bathroom sink literally fell apart (see picture) and woke us up. - No pool. - The only saving grace was the cleanliness and the fact that the hotel employees seemed to feel our pain (we told them we may check out early and they really couldn't argue and agreed).","San Jose, California","Kari R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",2,1.0

But boy, was I glad I found it. I'd been traveling solo and spent the first two days of my trip sick in a nearby hostel when I decided it was time to just call it quits and get myself into a private room at the closest hotel I could find.I booked Ewa Beach Hotel pretty last minute via Expedia on my iPhone. The booking went smoothly and I used some travel points so it worked out to about $50 a per night. (It would've been about $125 otherwise, still the cheapest hotel in Waikiki Beach.)I had a daytime tour scheduled and I didn't want to stay at the hostel for much longer so I arrived at 8:30 am to check in and had planned to leave my baggage there before returning in the afternoon to get into a room.First things first, the front desk attendant was WONDERFUL. He wasn't just friendly and polite, as most hotel staffers usually are, he was funny, kind, and sympathetic to my situation. He checked me in, gave me my baggage check tags, and I went on my way. When I returned, it was another attendant working the front desk but he was equally as friendly. Without even checking my baggage check tag number, he already knew which bag was mine: ""I had a feeling this colourful bag matched your personality.""I was given a room on the top 'sundeck' floor (which wasn't much use since it had been raining all week) but it was quiet and had a decent city view. The elevator doesn't go all the way up to the eighth/sundeck floor, which I was fine with, since it was only a short walk and staircase down to the seventh floor where the elevator begins. I was fine with this, but you may not be.The room itself was a decent size and the king bed was amazing. The pillows were comfy and firm, and the duvet/comforter was fine. The room had a fridge and a coffee maker which was perfect for my snacks and treats bought from the nearby ABC Store (just around the corner). There was an A/C unit which was easily adjustable.One of the best features of the room was the XBOX which played DVDs. I usually don't spend much time in hotels but because I was sick, I made good use of the hotel's DVD rental system. It's similar to RedBox and is located in their lobby. You're given a card at check-in that you can use to get free rentals from the kiosk. What a welcome relief and change from staying in a cramped hostel.It's just two blocks from the beach, a Starbucks, a block from a couple of ABC Stores, a nail salon, countless restaurants and bars, a moped rental place, and is well enough situated in the area.As some of the other reviews note, yes, it's a dated and older hotel and there are some spots that need updates (ie. paint, carpet) but for the most part, the hotel and my room was well-maintained and in good shape. If anything, Ewa Beach Hotel was perfect for me and I'm glad I stumbled onto it. If you're not in the budget for a fancy hotel but don't want to stay in a hostel, then Ewa is probably the perfect compromise.If anything, their staff was wonderful and worth it. Thanks to the staff at Ewa Beach Hotel for being the light at the end of a challenging couple of days spent being sick and cramped in a hostel!","Vancouver, Canada","yvrsteph</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",24,3.0

My friend and i were staying in a two-beds room on the 2nd floor, decorations & furniture is kind old, but it has everything you need. One thing i need to call out, is that there's a mandatory 10+ USD per day for WIFI, tea/coffee bag and a shuttle to the big mall. So you need to add that into your daily rate when you look at the price. I spent 4 nights at the hotel, the first two nights wifi worked fine, however, i couldn't log in wifi the last two days, figured it might be too many guests were using wifi at the same time.The hotel has a small parking lot, which requires reservation & 20 bucks per day, a bit pricy i would say. The staff are fine, but there was an asian look mid-age woman, who seemed to always fail to deliver full messages. The first day i asked about parking, she said first come first serve, never mentioned about reservation, so the second day when i drove my rented car back, the hotel couldn't give you a place to park, because parking spots were fully reserved.

Very near the zoo, and about 2 blocks from the ubiquitous ABC store. Buy a float or tube from the ABC (about $4) and enjoy Waikiki Beach - at this point it is contained by a low sea wall so you don't float out to sea or worry about rip tides.

Our room was on the 6th floor we booked a room with a kitchenette which was perfect cause we bought a few groceries and made our breakfast every morning. This hotel is by no means anything fancy but it's clean, quiet, and i thought the location was perfect for the price. You are maybe a one or two mins walk from Waikiki beach! They cleaned our room every day! The Shower has excellent water pressure...you hotta have great water pressure :) The Wi-Fi is not free but when i was on my room patio i could actually log unto to the EWA lobby Wi-Fi.... or you can go down and sit in the lobby and surf the net there! If you want to book any tours, this hotel doesn't really offer information or book tours for you...however up the street at the Queen Kapiolani hotel, they have all the tour information, pamphlets and will even book tours for you...we booked two tours this way and we got picked up in front of the Queen Kapiolani which again is maybe a one minute walk away from the EWA!! Again it's in a great location, up the street is a Wolfgang Puck express restaurant loved that place, food was sooo good, ate there a few times! There are ABC stores close by where we got our groceries etc... there's a Starbucks, Subway...everything is just mins away and I'm talking one or two mins walk not 10!! I'm more than happy with my choice because I personally think staying in a beachfront hotel would be too noisy at night not to mention pricy given it's Waikiki beach.

This one has new furniture so that was nice. Our room was spacious enough for three people there were two small beds and a sofa bed that was adequate. The bathroom was not very clean when we got in there was hair on the door and the worn out dingy bathtub and shower massager was not really up to par but, there was always hot water and for the price of the room for all three of us can't really complain about that.

It is located near the zoo and on a one way alley street which is nice because we are not partiers and don't need to be right on the strip. It was nice and quiet. The only real problem I had with our stay is that there is not enough parking which is $20 a night by the way. One night we asked to get parking and were told twice on the phone that there was not parking. When we got back tot he hotel we went to the parking garage and there was SUV parked in the one handicapped space. It however did not have a handicapped sticker so I went inside to ask about it since we do have one. The guy at the desk said that it was one of the employees that he sometimes parks there when he is a work. He said he didn't know anything about why we were told we had to park elsewhere at another hotel and walk 2 blocks back to our hotel. He was apologetic but, never made the employee move his car. I took photos of the SUV and the fact that he had no handicap parking. I think that the employees should be made to park elsewhere since there are limited number of spaces and not even enough for all the hotel guests as it is. This is a concern that I will have to consider for my stay in Waikiki in the near future.","Tampa, Florida","MrsMouser</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tampa, Florida</strong>",150,3.0

I paid the same for a different hotel in Waikiki last year, and had a great experience. I made the mistake of wanting to try something new here...We booked 4 rooms. Two of them had kitchens. They cost the same, and I was expecting them to be the same. They were not. One had a big window/door that opened to a balcony, and the other looked like a dungeon. The window looked like what I imagine to be a prison window. It was dark and very very smelly. But do not think the other room with kitchen was a lot better. The toilet was clogged. And after they came to fix it, it was not fixed, and we were told... nothing, just that it was not ""totally"" fixed. When I asked where I could hang my clothes, they told me to use the closet... but there wasn't one! And the floor had random spots that were wet. Plain wet that your feet could feel it. When we complained about all of it, they said they had no rooms available to switched us. So we changed hotels. And I sometimes read reviews of people who have to change hotels on the day they arrive, and I wondered how they could do this. Now I know: a lot of will to scape hell. Even after flying from MI and GA to HI, we still had the energy to leave this place. Of course it was not simple. The people at the desk were less than helpful. For example, they just started a conversation on the phone when I was in the middle of a sentence. Finally they agreed to refund us the WHOLE reservation if we leave by 9 pm. And we were more than ready to do so, so we left. But then when it was time to see our refund, we had to again call Expedia 3 more times to get the first day refunded. So it could have been a nightmare, but we ended up at the Hilton (Prince Kuhio), so I quickly forgot about all this trouble.

The beds were comfortable and there were no issues with warm showers. Room service brought up extra towels and pillows within 10 minutes of a call down to the front desk.

It really comes down to your wallet and what is most important when you have to make cutbacks and compromises. This smaller hotel is a kind of vintage unit from when Waikiki was in it's hey day. Our room was an end unit that had no view and was not much more than a large closet with a bed and a bathroom. In fact, our room didn't even have a closet or anywhere to hang clothes. I did look in other rooms that were open for cleaning and they were much larger and better than ours since some had kitchenettes.GOOD: LOCATION! A block and a half from the beach and all the action yet far enough to sleep and be peaceful. Two or three minute walk and your there. Same for the zoo. Half a block to the bus system that is easy and cheap to use. The hotel staff was average (good) and the rooms were old but fairly clean. Several remodel projects were underway and it was obvious they were trying to maintain this aging facility. You can see the ocean between the taller high rise units in front. The best kept secret is the rooftop. A great place to sun during the day and take a bottle of wine up to sip on at night. You can look down onto a couple of teen hostels for entertainment. The price I paid was considerably less than the nicer ones but Island hopping for two weeks had to cut back somewhere.BAD: This type of older hotels past their prime attracts families with noisy screaming babies and toddlers. Walls are not sound proof at all. Sometimes your lucky and sometimes your not - we were not. No lobby coffee or crumpets in the morning. Our room had a micro size coffee maker and you have to pay for the coffee packs after the first day. Really? It irks the s___ out of me how some hotels don't get the importance of getting their guests off to a happy start each day. UGLY: Literally, the décor. While I was happy to witness the maintenance staff painting and repairing things, EWA Hotel has a rough road ahead to bring it back to it's original shine. The front entrance was nice but the place next door was kind of ratty.Would I stay here again? Maybe.

Tip, if you only have one bag, take the BUS from airport, it's $2.50 take #19 or 20 about 1 hour and last stop on Kuhio, one minute walk to hotel. Also if you plan on using the bus, buy 4 day pass for $25 it beats carrying exact change and let's you go anywhere on island.","Barcelona, Spain","jimtokunaga</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barcelona, Spain</strong>",41,4.0

If you are planning to be out most of the time then it would be a good pick. It is very dated, the bathrooms are passable, but the bedding is clean and comfortable and the room is well made up each day. The front desk staff knew absolutely nothing about the local area so you would need to be confident at working things out yourself. We asked 3 different staff for advice about pretty basic things over the days we were there and not once did they have a clue. Also, the air conditioners in the rooms make no difference, we slept with the sliding doors to the balcony open at night so it might pay to get a room on the 5,6th or 7th floors. The unique thing about this hotel is that they can guarantee adjoining rooms for larger families. Due to fire regulations you can only have 4 people in a room, and we were a family of 5 and it was a real pain finding somewhere that would do more than 'try' to have an adjoining room. Also, consider getting a ticket for the red 'Aloha Bus' that roams the local area. We found it quicker than taking the pink line and good value for money as the pass is for 48 hours.

Chose this place based on location and price. Location is awesome. At the end of Waikiki, near the beach and zoo. While it's not on the beach, it's really, really close. Tiki's is close, as is Mac 24/7 and Tokkuri Tei. I'm a fan of all these restaurants, after eating at some very disapointing eseeded a room for tablishments in Waikiki. But, back to Ewa Hotel. Out front is a nice seating area with ashtrays if you smoke. The lobby is small, but clean and attractive. There's limited self parking in the parking garage for $15 a day, which is cheaper than most places in Waikiki. While there's no pool on the premises, the beach is easily within walking distance, and I'd take the ocean over a pool any day. The top floor of the hotel boasts a nice open area with potted palm trees and comfy chairs to lay out in the sun. The view of the ocean from here is lovely, especially at sunset. The downside is the elevator doesn't go to the top floor, you have to take a flight of stairs up from the last floor it stops at. This is especially disconcerting when you have a room at the top floor, and have to drag multiple suitcases up the stairs. I specifically asked for a room with one queen bed. When we finally hauled our luggage in to our room, we quickly discovered we were given two twin beds. For this reason I'm giving Ewa Hotel 3 stars. Not at all impressed with this blunder on the hotel's part. The room had a small balcony, and a mini fridge. Definitely appreciated that. The bathroom was tiny and as clean as it could be, but be warned, the bathrooms are old, and past being able to be cleaned properly due to their condition. There's at least new carpet in the rooms.  I've seen other rooms at other hotels in Waikiki, and I understand many places haven't renovated for a while, so all in all, the price is right for Ewa Hotel. Don't expect luxury, make sure you're not on the top floor if you have a lot of luggage, and if you reserve a room with a queen bed, I suggest verifying this is what you actually get, before you haul your belongings up to your room. Ewa Hotel is a quaint, rather quiet old hotel in a great area of Waikiki, that is affordable, thus allowing you more money to spend on food and activities.

The room was small and the furniture was not the latest styles but everything worked and was clean. The carpet looked very new and very clean. We had a nice little minifrig under the TV. The entire hotel was clean and well maintained. Parking was in small spot and was $20 a night but a special advertised for $25 you could get wifi and parking. One odd thing was that we started with two washcloths, two hand towels and two bath towels. The second day we only hand towels and bath towels and the third day we had only bath towels. It was not really a problem and we could always ask the front desk for more towels. The location was great with the zoo one block away and Waikiki Beach 1.5 blocks away. The front desk had signs highlighting the free movie on the beach one night. The bargain price compared to other hotels that had shady neighborhoods or cleanliness issues.

Now the staff is rude, skimps on everything from toilet paper to towels and room cleaning. First, we paid more money to stay for a weekly rental instead of a daily rental. Then we were told that as a weekly guest, the room would be service only ONCE A WEEK. Afterwards, we could only get 2 more towels to the two already in the hotel room, for a total of 4. AND OUR ROOM IS ONLY SERVICED ONCE A WEEK. So when we asked for more towels, they thought for whatever reason we had 6 and refused. Not sure why they thought we had 6 towels and why the maids would refuse towels to a guest that is staying for TWO weeks and only service the room ONCE a week. Eventually, it was cleared up, but then they REFUSED TO GIVE US TOILET PAPER. Again, we are staying here for two weeks, room is only serviced once a week and we ran out of toilet paper. I made it a point to politely ask what did the hotel staff think we should do without toilet paper. After several dumb stares and a long discussion, eventually I was able to get ONE more roll, but this is ridiculous. Again, we are being charged more but getting less service. The other ridiculous thing is that they claim to have only one room key. However, if you get locked out or whatever situation comes up, they have another key at the front desk or the maids have keys to the room. Really don't know what to think of hotel now. Do they really think they can save on costs if they limit room keys, towels, and service? This isn't the Ritz Carlton or the Hyatt, there's no room service, concierge, bell hop, gift shop, bar, travel service, fitness center, swimming pool, or restaurant. It's just the basics (room, bed, bathroom, wifi, business center) and a complimentary continental breakfast on the weekdays. They don't have the extras, but it's difficult to just get the basics. Other hotels are more than happy to service your room daily if you stay long term. No arguments over towels and toilet paper. The WiFi is free, but a little slow. Parking is reasonably priced.

It is a very good location at a little more than one block from Waikiki Beach and a block from the Honolulu zoo and two blocks from the Honolulu aquarium. It is a mile walk to the Saturday Farmers market (Kapahulu to Monsarrat by Queen Leahi Garden) at the entrance to Diamond Head Park Memorial hike. It was as expected: clean, comfortable and well aged. The standard twin room was large enough with two comfortable twin beds. The beds had pillow top mattresses. There were two slim pillows and one thick pillows. Each bed had a reading light. The air conditioner was quiet and efficient, The small refrigerator was wonderful for cold drinks, yogurt and salad. There was free WiFi. The rug was fairly new and clean. The bathroom was clean; however, the shower curtain had a ‘sour’ odor and needed a bleach job. The bath faucet handle was broken and hard to manipulate. Requests to have it repaired were ignored. The maid service was daily clean towels and beds made with carpet vacuumed.  There are no balconies with standard twins.; however, there is a large, little used, communal Balcony on the eighth floor with some view of Waikiki beach and ocean. We left a ‘generous’ tip ($20?). Maids and desk clerks were helpful and kind. They were a little ‘stressed’ as there was a Ewa Hotel ownership change during our stay. There was a most welcome lemon ice water decanter in the lobby for all thirsty guests.  There is boiled eggs, donut holes, ‘weak’ coffee, orange juice, toast, butter and jelly on the second floor from 7am to 9am daily including weekends. There are tables and chairs; a book trading corner with desk computers. On many occasions, ‘rude’ guests went in through the hostess door before 7am; helping themselves, while the harried hostess was trying to get things set up. The hostess had a ’Godly’ Patience with them and remained outwardly cheerful. Some guests were selfish enough to take the few offered newspapers back to their rooms for their private use; leaving the communal room with none. The Patience and Cheerfulness of the ENTIRE staff sets an example for the Humble!  There is car parking at $2/hr or $15/day. We suggest you forget the car and hike and/or use the greatest full island bus service (The BUS) in the entire civilized world. You will get back in shape, while eating the ‘to die for’ specials, and happy hour (4pm-7pm) at Moose McGillcuddys on Lewers St; one mile North on Kuhio from the EWA. You can also walk to the BEST Thrift store on the island, one mile east on Monsarrat accessed by Kapahulu ave. to Monsarrat (by the zoo). There you can buy all varieties of vintage and modern Hawaiian Jewelry, clean clothes, kitchen ware and books; for pennies on the dollar ; AND every penny you spend is donated by the sponsoring church and volunteers to help the homeless and needy on Oahu! (so ‘spend’ your tithe there!) In our perception and return experience; the Ewa hotel is the best location, service, most clean ‘BUDGET’ hotel we have experienced in Honolulu. We would recommend it to all other budget minded folks willing to accept that they can not expect the ‘Ritz’ for the price paid.","Redding, California","Lippylemurian</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redding, California</strong>",77,4.0

So two men asking for one bed were not really excepted. Our room also had a shower cap covering the one smoke detector in the room and I asked the front desk what that was all about and the answer was that they have to do that when they ionize the room so that the smoke detector doesn't go off..

Continental breakfast the same every morning - Orange juice, Tea/Cofee, Toast, Boiled egg(s) - cold, small doughnuts but pleasant dining room . Seating arrangements meant fellow visitors ended up talking to each other. WiFi in room worked well. Compared to other parts of USA Hawaii is expensive so the price for this hotel was good.

This wasn't a big deal if we left it on, but yeah.* There was a little bit of a musty smell which went away after we aired out the room. I wasn't sure if the previous guest had used mothballs or whatnot.* The safe wasn't free to use, though it seems like charging for access to the safe is a pretty standard practice. We opted not to use it, but left everything valuable hidden away when we were out. Nothing disappeared.Things that amused me:* The carpet doesn't really match the room at all, but seemed fairly new* The elevator had a bit of character; sometimes it would inexplicably stop at random floors, particularly the third one.* It's on a side street, so it's pretty easy to miss, but it also doesn't get a huge amount of tourist traffic either, and was reasonably quiet.","Seattle, Washington","billatq</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",15,4.0

From a security standpoint this made me feel very safe there. Many of the guests were Japanese tourists who are just incredibly courteous and not loud or roudy (unlike some). My room was on the 6th floor right next to the elevator--only once did I hear talking outside my door for a few seconds. There is brand new carpeting, a pillow-top mattress and a silent yet incredibly effective air conditioner.

The week of my arrivial they were doing the 5th floor. As for the bed, it was very comfortable. Yes some of the furniture might need refreshed but one does not stay in their room all day admiring the furniture. You want to get out and walk around, go to the beach and visit other sites. But one step at a time. I am sure that once they get their hallways in order that they will commence painting and renew the wallpaper in the rooms and possibly updating some of the furniture.. With that I thourghly enjoyed my stay and definitly would stay there again.Thank you Ewa Hotel Staff.","Verdun, Quebec, Canada","roger76_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Verdun, Quebec, Canada</strong>",0,4.0

The carpet is horrific and dirty but....they had signs up in the elevator stating that they were going to change all the carpets out. I did see them working on the carpet on the second floor when I left on Monday 4-19-10. The new carpet is a dark navy blue. The hotel needs paint in all the room and new furniture as well and hangers to hang your cloths up. The breakfast is bad and the donuts were old. I think if they add fresh fruit like pineapple and mango with fresh donut, muffins, and or mini bagels it would help. The deck looks really bad and needs paint and new lounge furniture as well. Its something I would not like to sit on. The carpet in the rooms look real bad and the frig and TV needs to be updated in my opinion. Not enough tables in the room but the bathroom and tub were very clean. Since the carpet is being changed and they seem to be getting things in order I would stay again next year because it fits my budget for travel and Im not into paying for rooms that run $800-1000 for just 4 days. The owner really needs to get things in order at this hotel if he cares about his business....upgrade it from top to bottom because it relly needs it. If it were not for staff and their excellent customer service this business would get a one in every section . Even the houskeeping staff was very nice and polite. ..","Los Angeles, California","hey36</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",0,3.0

We were not told prior to our stay that there is no elevator to go to the top floor and we had three strollers to move up and down daily. The rooms are adequate. They are kept quite clean and the furniture is all in good condition. However, it is an old hotel and the carpetting and appliances of the rooms show it. What ruined everytihng for us was the way were treated upon check out and in phone calls proceeding our stay. We were told of a ""special longstay rate' prior to book in that Gloria had told us she had us booked in for. Upon check out we were not giventhe special rate and Gloria (who was there) denied making that statement at our booking time. The manager said he would clear up our bill for us when we emailed our info on our home computer to them. When we did so, we were told that it was too late. The room had been chraged to a credit card adn they would not be giving us a credit, regardless of our hotel emailed proof.",Alberta,"harmonybear</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alberta</strong>",2,2.0

The property is older with view amenities such as a pool, restraunt, shops etc. The staff are very professional and friendly. What sells this property is its location only a short walk to Waikiki Beach. Very quiet area. The rooms are neat and clean. Improvements are being made and understandably the carpets are in need of replacement. This along with a needed interior paint job would greatly enhance this property. Overall the room rates are good for long term stays. A number of Japanese and Canadian guests stay at this property. We will definitely stay at the EWA again.D and M Gallant",saskatchewan,"queenscowboy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>saskatchewan</strong>",4,4.0

The room was fine, pretty old but nothing bothered me. If you stay there you should't pass through Lemon Street just next to Cartwrite Rd. (Especially, if you are female traveler.) There were some homeless look group every night. I didn't have good impression it. The hotel doesn't have swimming pool but Waikiki beach is only 5 mins though it's really congested.I noticed that a bed lined was not changed to new one. It was pretty disappointed. There were only soap and shower cap in the bathroom. It's good real hotel if you just stay for sleep.",Tokyo,"footygirl35</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo</strong>",11,3.0

It is a 2 star hotel and therefore cheaper than most, but is quite comfortable and certainly adequate. The staff are friendly, it is clean, and with the smallest kitchenette I have ever seen (in my room), allows you to save by not buying out all the time. It does show its age however, and the owners are slowly updating things like the carpets, beds, etc. If you don't want to pay high prices, and want to be very close to Hawaii beach, I can recommend the EWA.",Sydney,"LG-World-Traveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",4,3.0

For much less of the price some nearby hotels charged, this hotel provided an average service in a very good location.This is not a luxury property and it shows signs of time, but the room was comfortable (with buildings blocking any natural view). As I intended to spend very few time at the hotel, I found it OK to the pay what I did for it. No breakfast, but there were a number of options around (nothing memorable).Waikiki beach is located 3 blocks from the the hotel, and if you like to shop around there are plenty of souvenirs and clothing stores very close.Luis M., Caracas-Venezuela","Caracas, Venezuela","mixtli</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Caracas, Venezuela</strong>",22,3.0
