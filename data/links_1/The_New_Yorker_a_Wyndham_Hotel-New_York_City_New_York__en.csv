Check in was fast. The receptionist took our passports and realised it was my partners 40th birthday while staying at the hotel. They upgraded us to a city view (very nice touch) we were amazed. We went up to our room on the 36th floor, pulled the curtains open and WOW! The Empire State Building was right in front of us. It was amazing! We could also see Maddison Square Garden.The rooms are kept clean at all times. We speak more time in ours room than we would of liked due to New York doing into lock down due to Covid-19. The decor is art decor and in places, looks amazing, but in some parts, needs updating and looking after.We ate in ten Tick Tock diner attached to the hotel a couple of times. The food was ok. On the corner of the hotel is a subway entrance which made it easy to get around. The hotel is within walking distance of Times Square.The rooms are a little small but who cares, you won’t be in them for long anyway.All the staff we came across were friendly. We never had any issues at all.

This hotel is fantastic and the staff are AMAZING! We stayed for 8 nights and have to say the hotel location, staff and experience added to our wonderful trip. Staff members Samira and Driss were fantastic. Kept an eye on us all week to make sure we were enjoying our stay and always gave us great advice and tips to improve our New York experience. Honestly they went above and beyond what they needed to. I travel and use many hotels, and I have to say their customer service was one of the best I've received in recent times. There was also a female concierge, whose name I forgot to jot down (sorry) she also gave us some unique tourist tip ideas which allowed us to see things in New York that we couldn't find from generic websites. The hotel is great. If you're after a seven star type hotel at sky high prices, then this ain't for you. But if you want a nice clean friendly hotel with character in a superb location at a reasonable price, then this has to be number one! I read some comments saying it's 'dated'...I can see why they'd say that, but I'd have to say it kind of adds to its character. It has that feeling of what you see in the movies and it's unique in it's own way. The views from rooms I'm sure must be amazing as it's on the corner of 8th & 34th Street. We had fantastic views, which meant we didn't have to pay to go in to multiple skyscrapers to get the views. (Apart from Empire State Building, we paid to go in there).The location is fantastic, opposite Madison Sq Gardens. Subway Station right outside the door, walking distance to most major tourist spots. I could type all day about how great our experience was in New York and I'd have to say the hotel and staff definitely made sure our experience got off to a great start and then some. It's a very busy hotel, but staff are very efficient in dealing with it. But I can see they must get some miserable people in there demanding the world and probably don't have the energy to give them the experience we got. We went in with a smile and the staff definitely appreciated it. :)Highly recommend New Yorker! And once again, thank you to the hotel and staff for a great experience.","Manchester, United Kingdom","Yid1882</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

The New Yorker Hotel was very clean and the location couldn't have been better, just up the way from the Empire State Building and central for all the sites we wanted to visit. We were on the 34th floor of the Hotel. The room was very clean but also small but ideal for a long weekend which we were doing for my wifes Birthday with Friends.

One of the hotel representatives, Nalda, went above and beyond with her customer service to allow a refund due to the circumstances. This representative contacted the third-party that I booked through and facilitated details back and forth. Her turn around time was excellent with me and I was beyond satisfied with the outcome!

Ill give an honest review Im a UK travel agent so I'm used to reviewing and staying in many hotels. I had booked this via a supplier a good year in in advance so the reviews were better when I booked Firstly the good, the hotel is in a great location it really is so easy to get around and you can pretty much walk everywhere. Thats about it as far as the positive, the hotel in my opinion needs a really good update. i ended up having to upgrade my room on arrival which cost another 200 dollars on top of the standard room. This room was a lot larger and comfortable but the standard rooms really do need to be refurnished and a true idea of the rooms in the pictures displayed. With another 47 dollars a night resort fees its overpriced and there are better hotels. Service was ok nothing exceptional. The hotel is full of students, it looks like a lot of the top floor rooms are rented or filled with student accommodation, lifts were packed with them and a bit overpowering if your with a family. Average overall I would say and there are better hotels for your money",,846clares,9,3.0

Well... neither happened. I had made non-refundable reservations but called the hotel to see if their policy would change during this crisis. Every person I spoke to was so nice and helpful. One person that really stood out was Neida Aldama, a supervisor at the front desk. She was incredibly kind and compassionate about the situation, and offered that my prepayment be used as a credit that I can apply anytime in the next year (hopefully if/when Elton John reschedules!!). I feel that this was very generous, given the fact that they had every right to tell me I was SOL. Neida even went so far as to call me to directly answer a question I had.

Is it ""luxurious"", not exactly BUT for its time, yes it's pretty darned awesome! As with ANY hotel, we practiced general rules - no bare feet and don't assume it's just like home. Thousands of people are in and out no matter how ""fancy"" the hotel is. I'm hoping my photos prove there is no reason to believe the negative hype. The staff has been cheerful, cooperative and accommodating. I reserved a room with a terrace and got a high wall terrace (34th floor). It was cool for hangout and safe for small children but not as pictured on website. I politely requested whether the room pictured on website was available and was pleasantly surprised with a yes (22nd floor). Next day, new room was ready, perfectly cleaned and prepped for our transfer. Elevators were quick, not too crowded and hotel security was sufficient and not bothersome at all. To top it off, my child left a pair of AirPods in the Italian restaurant downstairs. It had been an entire day before we realized they were lost. Guess what! Bartender found them and put them aside waiting for us to claim them! How often does that happen?! :) Our stay has been wonderful all around and I encourage anyone to do their research on the rooms prior to booking then be polite and kind if you are not satisfied for some reason. A little kindness goes a long way, hence the five stars.

The subway is served by Penn station too so really easy to navigate the city.The hotel is one of the oldest in NYC but is well maintained and our room (3132) was clean and tidy as were the public areas.Check in was simple and quick and we were made to feel welcomed.There are plenty of lifts and they are split equally to serve the bottom half of the hotel (lobby to floor 20) and the top half (floor 21 to floor 40). Our upgraded room was cleaned on a daily basis and included clean towels. We also had clean bedding often. The bed was also the comfiest we have ever slept on in a hotel room.We had a fridge for drinks , an iron and ironing board, safe and television in the room along with a sofa and a desk and chair.Our room had a direct view of the Chrysler building but some rooms also have a view if the Empire state building too.Overall we would stay here again and would recommend the hotel to others visiting NYC.","Wakefield, United Kingdom","659glynnp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wakefield, United Kingdom</strong>",36,5.0

Never had problems when I was there...however, when I arrived on check inn I was told I had to pay $150 which was £121.59 English money for a security deposit (if I broke anything or smoked in the room etc) which I didn’t and on check out I was told the money had been refunded back into my account and I would get it within 5-10 days. Which was fine!! Until it gets to March 2020 and I still haven’t received my money. First I contacted my bank in the middle of January, they told me to contact the hotel so they put me through to the head office at the New Yorker hotels. After being on the phone for 40 minutes and no luck I was told the only way to contact the employees about my refund was to email. So I did, I received an email back explaining how the computer system had a ‘glitch’ on check out and my refund wasn't processed. They told me they had now released my refund (on the 2nd feb 2020) and I would receive it within 10 working days. So I wait and wait till the 17th February and still no refund. It’s now March and I still have no received my £121.59. I am so so disappointed with the company’s emails to me they haven’t been helpful at all and don’t seem to care that I have lost that money and 3 and half months down the line I don’t think I will get it back.

There are a few things that I would say about the hotel. We had to pay $5 dollars a bag to leave at the hotel before check in and after check out which I think is a little naughty, we should be able to leave our bags at the hotel free of charge for all the money we have paid. Also when we arrived at the hotel they ask for your debit card, this is incase of damages. Now we were not informed of this before hand and also the amount it would be $180 and it was taken out of our account and left us a little short and told it will take 5/6 days to go back into our account. This is wrong in my eyes, no money should be taken out of our account and I am yet to wait the 5 days to make sure it has gone back in. Also in Febuary it is very cold and the sheets on the bed are very thin so I found myself very cold at night. The only other thing I would say is New York is a lot of walking and I think the hotel should consider putting a kettle and some tea and coffee in the room so when your tired at the end of your day you can go back and chill with a nice hot drink.","Portsmouth, United Kingdom","stace1305</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portsmouth, United Kingdom</strong>",5,3.0

There are no tea or coffee facilities in the room( tough if you’ve been travelling for 10 hours) and although there is water, this is chargeable at $5 per bottle. The lifts upto floor 20 are frequent, anything above that, you best be prepared for a wait. If you want to leave your luggage, perhaps because you have a later flight, it’s charged at $5 dollars per bag, per hour, first time I’ve come across that in Manhattan, perhaps we have been lucky. Late checkout is charged at $50 ( I think that gives you 3 hours on top of normal checkout) , we had this complimentary due to the issues we faced during our stay( thanks Meghan) The resort fee is $30 per room per night and for this you get access to Gym, business centre and international phone calls, however, this is still payable even if you don’t want to access these facilities. Again, we had it complimentary due to the issues we had. The room we had was tiny, and we didn’t always get housekeeping but when we complained they did waiver the above charges. The reception staff aren’t the friendliest which is a shame as visiting New York is a big deal for the majority of tourists and a smile goes a long way.

One night there were so many people waiting, a member of staff took groups of guests up in the staff lift - Towels were clean and regularly replaced but small and not oft- Nowhere to place toiletries in the small bathroom- No kettle but one could be hired for $30 dollers a dayOverall we were delighted with our choice of hotel and would thoroughly recommend it.

I would have thought an airport like JFK would have been more organised. We got a taxi to the hotel ($65 plus tip) and upon arrival we were told that we had been upgraded to a family suite on the 39th floor. We were also told that we had free wifi and free international calls. There was a facilities fee of $135 which we were told was for things like water/room service etc. Turns out the facilities fee was for the ""free"" wifi and we felt completely ripped off and we were charged $92 dollars for this privilege of using this. Our upgraded ""suite"" turned out to be nothing more than a run down bedsit with a double bed and a dirty looking sofa bed. We declined the offer of the upgrade and asked for the room we had originally booked which was an executive double with wet room. I can only assume that the hotel was hoping to sell our original room at higher rate than we had booked for.

The hotel is approximately a 10 minute walk to Times Square and Broadway. In the morning the hotel has a take out breakfast stand which is very popular, although we didn’t eat here so can’t comment on the quality or price but, the queues spoke for themselves. The only issue is with the lifts in the hotel. They take a very long time to arrive and often when they do arrive they’re too full to even try to squeeze into, resulting in a further wait. One day, some of our party, who were staying on the 28th floor, waited 15 minutes for a lift to arrive. We stayed on the 8th floor and ended up taking the stairs every day to avoid the wait, fine if you’re able bodied, but not great if you need access to the lifts.

As the room was just to sleep, we did not bother asking for a better room and one that had a view of a wall; this was despite emailing the hotel in advance and asking a question re cabs and asking for a room with a view - no response was received. The elevator situation is main issue with the hotel - we were on floor 22 and were not able to get one any morning. We chose to walk the 22 flights down but many people stood waiting for over 15 minutes and then gave up, returning to their room! There were 7 elevators but 2 only ever seemed to be in operation. The other issue which would stop us staying in this hotel again were the amount of homeless people congregating at the front - I believe there is a shelter nearby so the MacDonalds & TacoBell tended to have people in there clearly intoxicated with drugs or alcohol; not something I wanted 2 14 year old girls to be around.","Plymouth, United Kingdom","Uk1010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plymouth, United Kingdom</strong>",64,3.0

Right opposite madison square garden and a 10 min walk (if that) from Times Square. We couldn’t have been more pleased with the location. It’s also a 2 minute walk from somewhere that does THE NICEST bagel. It’s called ‘best bagel and coffee’. It was so nice we visited more than once.

There was a revolving door, but of course that was out of order. The lady at check in was impersonal to the point of rudeness. She typed stuff into the computer and said, ""credit card"". I asked how much security was to be taken and she said 4 nights, $140. I felt as though I shouldn't have asked her. We waited for around 15 mins for an escalator as only half worked. They said they are due to refurbish them sometime never. We were in one room, two queen sized beds. I know New York rooms are small but this room really was small.

First was that due to the hotel being full, the room I had booked and paid for was ‘not available’. Despite my protestations we had to settle for a room with no view at all. The second was that the concierge tried to charge me $130 for tickets to a game at the Garden that I actually paid only $54 at MSG box office! So unfortunately I have to advise that if you choose to stay at the New Yorker, don’t think you will necessarily get the room you actually booked and paid for, and don’t trust the concierge desk with arranging your entertainment requirements!

It was easy to do, and took that city parking stress away from our trip which we loved!! (Retrieving the vehicle at the end was super smooth as well) There was a dog show in the hotel, so there were dogs everywhere. I do have an allergy to them, but it never seemed to bother me. Our double bed room was super clean, the bathroom was small, but had the antique faucets and door knobs, that took you back in time. The view out of our window was of the Empire State building , I sat for hours looking at it during the night. There was noise from the road below even though we were on floor 32, but that is to be expected. There were 4 windows (2 per wall) that were drafty, so we turned the heat up to counteract that. The beds were clean, and the mattress did not leave me with any back pain. If we go back, we will likely try to stay in the exact same room again. This particular room did not have a microwave or a fridge, there were 2 bottles of water in the room which were pretty expensive, 500ml Poland Springs for $3.81 and a 1 liter for $5.44.

The suite had two bathrooms as well as two rooms. The downside was the bedroom was a corner room and had windows overlooking two sides of the street hence this maximised amount of noise from the sirens at night (but i suppose it being NY this is expected). ALso, the bathroom had a bit droughty window and the sink did not drain very well. The air conditioner was working ok until one night it stopped and became very cold in the room (we managed to switch it back on alright). Otherwise, the beds were extremelly comfortable - the best beds i've ever slept in. ALso, the hotel is located in the centre of what we wanted to do as it was very close to the undeground station and Macey's. A bit dissapointed with Tic Tok though as the prices were expensive, which included tips, and the food was not that great (like in many places in US food tasted artificial).

[I believe] since i called the hotel directly a week in advance of the reservation to confirm, all went well. Mohammed, who checked us in, was very helpful and knowledgeable. We got the room type we reserved and it was nice. However, this time, there was NO refrigerator or coffee maker. Very inconvenient but available at a surcharge of, from what I'm told, was around $40/stay. There were major problems with the entrance doors, being worked on. HUGE wind tunnel going in and out. Don't bother doing your hair before going out. The elevators were only about half functioning (5 out of 12?). Usually we have a pleasant experience mingling with the dog people and their dogs but they were unfriendly and appeared bothered by those of us who attended the show as spectators. I can only assume the elevator situation wore their patience thin, especially when dealing with a dog in the hotel. The hotel itself needs some major work. The bathrooms especially. I think the entire hotel shares one big water heater as, when taking a shower, the water temp changes as if someone is flushing the toilet every 5 seconds--scalding to freezing to scalding, etc. The paint is chipping, the moulding is chipped and cracked like an old bathroom at home. The lighting in the rooms is awful and like halogen lamps. Not comfortable or soothing. The housekeeping staff was friendly, but are on duty and making noise til very late at night.

My first visit was fairly pleasant in December 2018, I was checked in by the manager at the time, who without asking reduced the facilities fee to $15 per night, as I was staying for 7+ nights which was a very well received gesture, however, the room I stayed in was not up to standard. Cold with an unreliable shower, dirty carpet and unpredictable aircon/heating but as this was my first visit didn't think much of it as I spent little time in the hotel. My second trip as of last week (Jan-Feb 2020) unfortunately will be my last. I cannot fault the lady who checked me and my partner in as she was incredible with top notch customer service, went out of her way to check us into a room on the 36th floor, with a view of Madison square garden and the empire state, as this was a late Christmas present for my partner, unfortunately I didn't catch her name as she was the only positive part of this hotel experience. As my previous trip, I booked through Lastminute.com who insisted & confirmed in writing that all additionaly fees (including the resort fee & city tax would be $259.70 which I had printed black & white confirmation from my booking) - This was not the case, as when I received the invoice on check out the hotel had added additional fees, an extra sales & city tax not stated anywhere on their website, third party booking or Wyndham website bringing an additional fee of nearly $300!. When I enquired this at the front desk I was met by an extremely rude customer service agent who said it was me in the wrong. I asked for the manager as anyone would in this circumstance as I had proof of my booking and confirmation in writing. The manager was even more abrupt and borderline hostile saying the confirmation was wrong and even smiled an joked about this with her colleagues, absolutely disgusting behaviour that no guest should have to go through. I managed to flag down the lady who had initially checked me in who couldn't have been more apologetic and within seconds had checked my booking and admitted there had been an error on my booking and adjusted the fee accordingly, I wish I had taken her name because she was an absolute superstar compared to the rest of the staff at this hotel. The whole experience fromt this hotel has confirmed that I'll never stay or recommend this hotel to anyone in future. In conclusion, this is a run down hotel cashing in on it's location with terrible customer service, old decor & trying to con guests with hidden fees that are not stated anywhere upon booking. The fact that this hotel calls itself a 4* hotel is a joke as I've stayed in budget hotels with better facilities and service. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. There are far better & cheaper hotels in the area, with no hidden fees & better service.

Her response was to deny that this was even tabled.Our family holiday will be forever tarnished with bad feelings, solely at the responsibility of Wyndham New Yorker. The occurrence of initial error, the behaviour of the staff member who addressed our initial concerns, the avoidance of our complaint when lodged via email and finally the deceptive way in which you applied charges well after our check- out is the reason for this. Clearly meeting your customers basic expectations is not a priority. What a disappointing experience ... your hotel has significant issues for example: - consistently broken lifts, - outdated rooms, - staff requesting to inspect balcony’s in the middle of our stay ( for no reason provided other than the engineer need to see your balcony and it couldn’t wait until we had checked out .....why???),- loud parties that are not managed for noise complaints, - being told airline staff take priority check in over other guests ( certainly makes your feel special!) this goes for a gaming conference as well,- charging guests an additional flat rate fee to store each bag... very excessive and was a much talked about topic by all guests ( American and international), especially given the late check in time. - an information desk whose only response is to refer you to the check in counter ... for multiple questions asked from subway advice, New York travel advice, hotel advice, restaurant advice etc.... why do you even have this services??? )- no tour desk ( very odd given the number tourists), and finally...- we were advised of another guests complaint who was equally frustrated...She advised us that she didn’t have hot water for 3 days and after daily complaining she still wasn’t offered another room ( once again the information desk proved to be of no use in supporting her through this process where she was directed to the extensively long check in line!).

I arrived a couple hours early and the hotel offered to hold my bags or I could pay a $50 fee and they'd put me in a room early. I've not seen hat option in a long time. I decided to pay the fee and drop my bags in a room as I had places to go and things to do. The morning of my departure a paper bill had been slipped under the door.

Bathroom so basic and tile ridges filthy, overall a very poor standard. Then hit with a $30 per night tax $120 and $5 per case $25 to store luggage after checkout. Bed, toilet and bath where clean and after being travelling for 20 hours we where just glad to get our heads down.

After getting out of the lift you are met with dark, dirty and dated corridors. From that moment I knew there was going to be a problem. The first room was no bigger than the bed itself. The room was absolutely filthy. After speaking to reception and changing rooms we were moved to a slightly bigger one which was a bit cleaner. However it was very dated and the bathroom is in real need of repair as the tap was constantly leaking and the dirt on the tiles and corners of the bathroom was ingrained. When returning the key cards for the other room I was ignored at reception and no one bothered to ask whether the room was ok. Some of the bathroom linen we used during the week also needs replacing as there were holes and bare patches on some of the towels. We spoke to other guests who also had issues with dirty towels and bed linen during their stay. We made sure we left the hotel early and didn't return until late.

I had one big surprise when I checked out and I want to make sure others are aware of it - When you (or your travel agent) make a booking, make absolutely double sure that you are quoted a total and inclusive price. If not, you will be hit by a 'facility fee' of $30 per day plus tax at checkout. When I could speak, I asked what this charge was for and was told 'it covers use of the hotel facilities' like the business centre, phone calls and the free wifi - whether you use them or not. I then asked if they had a luggage room to leave our bags until our airport transfer and they have, for $5 per bag.

When travelling from Australia with a family of five that is A LOT of luggage to be checked. I have never before been charged for this for this service and found it a little distasteful. * Second negative was out on our balcony (YES! we had a balcony, but i will get to that) was a bag of left over food from the previous guests that wasn't cleaned up. We had to step over fries, wrappers, and half eaten burgers :(.Now for the positives which far out way the negatives. The location! The New Yorker is straight over the road from Penn station. We arrived by train from Boston and it was a 2 minute walk to our hotel. It was also walking distance to all the tourist hotspots such as Times Square, Rockefeller, Bryant Park, 5th ave, the list goes on. Everything else was a short subway ride away. The staff. All the staff where friendly and helpful, giving detailed advice and support when needed.The room. We where given a fantastic room. Not only did we have a corner balcony, we had clear unobstructed views of the Empire State building and Madison Square Garden which was directly across the road. To have a balcony in New York for the price we paid is almost un heard of.The eateries. The Hotel has on site 3 eateries. One diner, and 2 restaurants.

Mohammed went above and beyond for us. The room was great. We were on the 33rd floor. Beautiful views of the city! The two eateries were wonderful as well & reasonably priced. We had a wet room, which was perfect for my needs. The room was kept very clean & we had a constant supply of towels & clean bedding when required. The concierge outside the hotel was so pleasant & always flagged down a disabled friendly taxi when we needed one. The hotel security was great too. We felt very safe - you have to show room keys to enter the lift area to the rooms & we really valued this extra level of security they had in place. Location was perfect;couldn’t ask for better. We foolishly left a high value item behind in the hotel room. We didn’t have high hopes of getting it back but within 24hrs the hotel had found the item, securely parcelled it up & dropped it off at a local fedex at our choosing (we covered the postage cost), item was returned to us in the uk in a matter of days & in perfect condition, just as we’d left it.

To charge almost $40 a day for the use of a gym, that most people are not going to use and along with a few other minor amenities is wrong. I expected more from a Wyndham hotel and this hotel should be ashamed of how they are ripping off their customers with this fee. -In spite of paying the “Facilities Fee”, there wasn’t even a coffee maker in the room.

Our room allegedly had a queen bed, which really looked like a full, and we could barely move around without bumping into each other.

So first impression about the hotel, I enter the lobby and there are so many people waiting there it feels like an airport, where people are just waiting with nothing to do. It's just dirty. I stand in the line for check in. It was a long 25 minute wait. my problem was that I was moving from a hotel from Long island City to the new Yorker and I just needed to keep my bags and get out because I had an event booking at 4 pm in Randall island. I came in at 1 pm since I was in the area. I asked them if I could just bring the bags and you could give me the room later, I didn't even need to see the room. But the receptionist said that they charge 5$ a bag as luggage storage fees and 50$ for early check in fees. So I told him I don't need to physically check into the room I just needed to complete the check in process so I didn't have to wait in the line again after coming back tired in the evening. So he told me that he could do that but not give me the key, I would just need to collect the key whenever I come back.After spending the entire day outside, I come back tired and walk to the reception to ask for my key. She tells me that I need to wait in line just like the others. I showed her my payment receipt and key card holder she refuses to listen to me and quite arrogantly tells me to go back and join the line like the others. I go back and wait for 25 more minutes for my turn. She wants to see my ID again and finally hands me the key. I get to my room, the room is small, the bed is small, the bathing towels are the size of napkins, they dont have a kettle in the room, the bathroom floor is so cold, it is impossible to get inside it at night because it is December and the temperature is below 0*C, I can't even stay in the bathroom for longer than 15 mins it's so cold. I get it that it's a low cost hotel, but charging a resort fee of 44$ a night for amenities that I don't want to use and keeping a 500 ml water bottle for 5$ and 350 ml bottle for 3.5$ is just cheap, which hotel doesn't give complimentary water.All of this is fine. It's your business you know how to run it better. But the staff is so arrogant, sometimes you ask for the key card to go up the elevator, sometimes you don't. But one night when I have roamed the entire city and come late at 12:30 am, you ask me for my key card to access the elevator and speak loudly to me when I am tired and fumble to find it see it is just plain insulting. I have stayed in many hotels but never has anyone asked me for my key card and stopped me at the elevator. DONT MAKE YOUR CUSTOMERS SUFFER IF YOU CANNOT STOP NON-CUSTOMERS ENTERING THE HOTEL, it isn't my problem. Then there was one incident when my wife asked a staff at the hotel if she knew the tick tock diner would be working on Christmas day. She very arrogantly said maybe , maybe not, you need to ask them and not me. YOU ARE IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY, BE NICE, DOESNT COST ANYTHING.The nicest person among the hotel staff was the cleaning lady that we accidentally met. The location is nice, the price is reasonable compared to hotels nearby. Doesn't mean you treat customers disgracefully. It's not right, it's not what I expect after paying 212$ for a night.","Mumbai, India","savlapriyank</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, India</strong>",10,1.0

I will start by saying the location is great, right next to Penn station. Reception staff were nice, however only dealt with them upon check in and check out. Beds were comfortable and the room was generally clean.Small, cramped and outdated rooms. Tiny bathroom. For the price and also the photos online - not worth it. The walls were also so thin we could hear everything next door. Waiting for the lifts took forever despite there being so many of them and there was always a queue. I hated the thought of returning to the hotel to use them. Also, one night every single lift was filled with the smell of fish, and everyone was gagging. Still no idea what it was. Speaking of disgusting smells, one afternoon while changing in our room, the room filled with the smell of weed coming from the vents. It was disgusting and despite needing to change, we just grabbed our things and left, hoping it would be cleared by the time we got back (thankfully it was). Shampoo was not refilled during our stay so my partner had to contact the reception to ask for more. Shampoo has always been refilled in European hotels, but not sure if this is standard for American hotels. It took about 15 minutes to get through to someone, who said someone would be up shortly, but it never arrived. Had to end up going downstairs to collect it. If they had told us they were busy rather than saying someone is on their way up, collecting it wouldn’t have been a problem. There is also a fee for holding your bags in storage. While it’s cheap, it’s the principle of it. Never been charged to store our bags before and we’re already paying an expensive facility fee for facilities we wouldn’t and didn’t use, so don’t see why we should pay extra for bag storage for a few hours. Overall, we only used the hotel for sleeping and changing. It was not the best hotel ever and the price was not worth what we got, however, if you’re not bothered about the hotel and are just looking for a good location and a place to sleep, the hotel is fine.

Despite its immense number of rooms, the elevators work reasonably - with the exception of the period comprised between 7h45-10h00 a.m. You have got to bear this in mind if you are in a rush to take your train or a flight. A very subtle tip would be to divide the numerous elevators (6 to each colums of 20 floors) into a smaller number of floors each, let us say, 3 floors for each elevator. That is the main reason for my 4-star rating, which made me very upset by the time I was checking out. The keys are also very fragile in terms of losing their magnet, as I had to change their code very frequently, something annoying. But, on an average condition, this hotel is definitely reccomended: the bathrooms is constantly well cleaned, although my mattress was very soft/old, which caused me some pain on my lowback.

So now this other worker named Samira, who was UBER RUDE, was booking me in and asking if there are any rooms although I had a CONFIRMED booking. Now whilst all this is going on, another patron came to ask for a coffee pot in their room and was told it would be $50 a day!! WTF?!! I felt like it was the twilight zone. Smh.

Yes it was smaller than what you’d be used to in UK hotels but it was perfectly adequate for 2 adults.

The bathroom was fine - reallly good shower with plenty of hot water - tv with loads of channels, iron, ironing board, hairdryer, toiletries but no tea or coffee facilities however there is a coffee bar in the lobby.Now the corridors on our floor had a very musty smell - like old dirty carpets - the corridors really need updating & the rooms could probably benefit from a refurbishment to modernise them but this is my only criticism.The location is within walking distance to most midtown attractions- there are cafes & restaurants all with earshot.All staff we dealt with were lovely however I’d avoid the in house Italian restaurant- the service was horrendous when we went - never felt so invisible in all my life In a nutshell the hotel whilst far from being luxurious or even top end is perfectly adequate - in our experience it was clean & tidy, we didn’t experience noise as such - certainly nothing to keep us awake.

My final advice to you is that “if you decide to book at this hotel. You’d need to lower your expectations of a 4-star hotel and bring it down to a 2-star motel. Then you will be ok. And if you want to upgrade your room, you will be easily able to find a much better hotel with similar price around the same location.

Shame I won’t be selling it or recommending it to my paying customers again.I was aware of the resort fee prior to travel, however the Wyndham’s resort fee felt like daylight robbery. The only service it included that would be used by tourists was the free wi-fi, shame this constantly flicked on and off. Many hotels in New York include bottled water, food an beverage credits in their resort fee and this can sometimes make up for the fee. The resort fee at the New Yorker includes nothing and they charge one of the highest amounts in New York! No coffee or tea facilities in the room, no fridge, $7 warm bottle of water in the room. What am I paying $27 plus taxes per night for??We were travelling to New York to celebrate my boyfriends special birthday. What a shame that the hotel couldn’t care less. I had e-mailed them directly twice to inform them, and surprise nothing was done, not even a note in the room. Very disappointing and as an agent I would be just as disappointed if I went to the effort to inform them for a client and they did nothing. They will charge you $27 plus tax per night and can’t even acknowledge a special birthday!Our room was average, nothing special but worse than I expected. I am aware New York rooms are small in size, however that wasn’t the issue. Our bathroom was dirty and never properly cleaned in the 5 days we were there. Dirty marks on the bath, shower constantly went hot and cold & they had removed the bath plug so you were unable to have a bath. Final outrage was on check out they wanted to charge us $5 per bag to store our cases for a couple of hours! Surely this should be included to hotel guests in the resort fee!!Only good thing about the hotel is the location, great for Times Square, penn station and the Empire State. Advise from a travel agent would be to pay the extra £25 per night and stay somewhere else where they appreciate their customers and include services In their resort fee.

When we said that all of our money is in cash, they said that if we wanted to pay this in cash they would charge up to $900?!? We advised that this was our spending money so they agreed to reduce this to $475 which was a massive chunk of our spending money. Excellent service (NOT). We did get the money back but too late really as it was to the detriment of our trip. We were also charged $5 per bag to hold them which we have never had to do. This hotel just want to money grab at every opportunity . The staff are awful and rude. When I mentioned it was our first wedding anniversary we were ignored and told that if we wanted a nice view it would be $120 a night. None of the staff seem to know what they are doing or charging, and seem to make it up. Whilst we were there the whole queue at front desk was full of people saying money had been taken from their credit card without being told. Very dodgy business and despite really being excited to stay here we will never return. Oh and at the end of the stay they simply post your charges under your door rather than face to face.

To get started, I've stayed there for about 5 days with a baby. I came back one night to find that my little travelling kettle that I use for making hot water for the baby's milk missing. Couldn't find it after ransacking the entire family room. Now imagine doing that with the baby crying for his milk! When I called the front desk they aren't sure what happened and reckoned that it could be taken by one of their staff. Only after a few phone calls that they deduced it could be taken by their security team but couldn't confirm as 'the team is off duty'. What comes next takes the ante - since they have no kettle in the room, they told me to buy hot water from the 24hr cafe downstairs for $1. This is ridiculous coming from a Wyndham hotel! Sheer madness ensued with a crying baby, rushing down to buy the hot water and waiting in queue for it. The security manager called the next day to confirm that room service have indeed taken the device because they deemed it as 'hazardous' and they should have left a note but failed to do so. As an apology she offered to provide a 'approved' kettle but when I returned the same night, it was a Keurig coffee maker. So I suppose I should use the coffee maker to boil hot water for making baby's milk huh? So another night of paying for hot water at the cafe.I dropped an email to the hotel manager about the issue and he apologised for everything that happened, offered a 50% discount off a night's rate (wow...) and even offered to give a favourable rate for my future stay (not a chance). Well... I have checked out for almost a month without seeing the discount he gave. A follow up email to him about 2 weeks ago also went unanswered. It's not about the money but about keeping your word, especially from a reputable chain like Wyndham.By the way, the hotel charges $5 per bag you leave with the conceirge as some reviewers have already lamented. Imagine paying for this after the front desk told you curtly to join the queue again, after you have queued earlier to do the check-out.I should have trusted my instinct and continued to stay at the M chain hotel which I have stayed for over a week before this. Such a disappointing experience from Wyndham and to think they even asked me to join their loyalty programme after this.

I declined and checked my bags as I had a day of work meetings and didn't need the room until later. Little did I know that I'd be downgraded for having declined. When I finally returned to claim my room key, I was surprised to find I'd been assigned a room that was not much larger than my bathroom at home. It had a lovely view, high on the 35th floor which I appreciated only long enough to realize that the room was cold, very cold, even though the thermostat was set at 72. I could hear the wind whistling in the bathroom through the un-insulated, painted over bathroom windows. The bed was made with only a sheet covering a thin blanket, with no additional blanket(s) in the closet so in the middle of the night, when I was too sleepy to call down for an extra blanket, I had to turn the heat up to 80 before I felt any heat at all, after which I sweltered the rest of the night. The next night, I just wore tights and a sweatshirt to bed and left the thermostat alone. The room was clean however there were cobwebs in the corner of the windows in the bathroom, and the paint over the window pane was peeling in spots. Despite there being a great many elevators in this very highrise hotel, it always seemed as if there were only one or two at most working at a time. Elevators were slow and at busy times (morning, especially), seemed to stop at every single floor. I could hear partying tourists in the hallway and/or nearby rooms (as my bed was right next to the door in this tiny room) and the walls were not very thick. I believed I'd gotten a good deal when I booked the room, and now I realize that, at least in NYC, it is worth it to pay a higher premium for a better hotel, than to rely on this historic ""grande dame"" of a hotel to offer much more for your dollar.","Newton, Massachusetts","LBGansfam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newton, Massachusetts</strong>",44,3.0

Arrived at JFK (what a joke immigration is!) and got the air train and LIRR straight to Penn station in half an hour. Reception allowed us to check in early for no fee into our queen metro room ( did ask about upgrading but for $65+ tax per night didn’t bother).Corridors to the room looked like something from American horror story (the hotel one) and the room was very small.

At $343 for the night, it was not cheap by any means, but most similar hotels were priced around the same at the time (mid October 2019).The hotel has a pretty late check in time of 4 PM (compared to the standard 3 PM) and indeed, when I checked in, I was told my room was not ready, so I decided to store my bag until I could check in later. I was pretty shocked to learn that I had to pay a $5 fee to store my bag for a few hours. I've never been to a hotel before or since that charged for that ""service"". Once I got to my room, I found that it was incredibly small and cramped. There was barely room for the bed. The room had no view either, except of the building opposite which appeared to be an office building of some sorts. I could see the people through the window pretty clearly, and I'm sure they could see me too! The street noise could definitely be heard too even though I was on a relatively high floor.The hotel is located in a busy section of 8th Avenue, very close to Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and the Empire State Building. It's definitely convenient if you are going to a show at MSG. In terms of amenities, the room had most of what I'd expect, although no mini bar and the TV quality was quite poor. It seemed to show most of the TV channels in analog instead of HD, which is pretty amazing for an upscale Manhattan hotel in 2019. The clock radio woke me up at 6 AM the next morning which was quite annoying - I guess it hadn't been turned off from the previous occupant.The bathroom was very old-fashioned and didn't look very modern. There was a separate shower at least, but the shower head was not very good, and the water pressure was not soft at all.The common areas, such as the lobby, look nice and have the old school 30s kind of charm. Indeed, I'm sure the hotel was very luxurious and opulent in its hey-day, but nowadays it's mostly run down and not worth the high room cost. I'd recommend finding an alternative hotel in Manhattan, except if you are only staying one night for an event at MSG for example.","Copenhagen, Denmark","NirvClub</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Copenhagen, Denmark</strong>",219,2.0

There wasn't a great deal of close restaurants but the ones we found in walking distance were good. The only negative we had was when we made the reservation they asked if it were a special occasion and we said it was our 33rd Anniversary yet nothing was said or done. Then in an email they asked if we would like to upgrade our room (for a price) and my husband wanted to surprise me with a view of the Empire State Building and when we checked in they didn't have it.

The staff answered any questions/concerns we had in a helpful and reassuring way. Now the hotel itself is quite historic and old so it is in need of a little renovating here and there but it doesn't ruin the experience. The rooms have the same problem but they are clean and adequate which is what matters.

The hotel is FINE. Its an older building with interesting history and a pretty cool little set of museum stuff in the business area. But the rooms are VERY small. Which I know isn't that wild of a thing in New York City but its not ideal as I was traveling with a lot of luggage for a convention and had almost no room to put it. The bed took up half of the room. Which again I understand and its fine. Not Ideal but fine. My main issue and why I'm giving such a low rating is that when I booked my room well in advance in August I booked it for 2 people. I wasn't sure if my friend could come with me so I didn't add her name to reservation. That SHOULDN'T have mattered. But when I added her name to the reservation about a week before the check in date they said I had modified the reservation (which already had 2 people on the reservation just no name for the second person) they charged me 25$ a night for adding another person to the reservation. This was just wildly unfair and didn't make sense to me because I wasn't CHANGING anything. Just adding her name.So 130$ later my friend tries to check into the room and her name WASN""T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION. SO they charged me an extra 130 for absolutely nothing. And I called to try and fix this as soon as i got the email saying that the reservation had changed and they kept saying that I had my information wrong even though I had the print out of the first email with the original cost right in front of me. They kept asking if I booked through a third party when I booked WITH THEM through THEIR website. Eventually I got sent to the customer service line and they weren't able to do anything other than say ""Yes you're right it seems weird that they did this. Here's your case file and they'll call you after THEY decide if you should be reimbursed. It could take about a week""Which would be after my trip was over. So I MAY get a refund for my money and I MAY not and most likely won't because no one wanted to believe me that I had proof of a cheaper and different charge before hand because when they changed my reservation they changed the data in the system.Again. HER NAME WASN""T EVEN ON THE RESERVATION WHEN WE GOT THERE.

The fact that this hotel claims to be a 4 star hotel is an outright lie. I have stayed in several real 4 star hotels and this hotel is more like a 1 star hotel. The lobby looks nice and the photos of the rooms are extremely misleading which is all to trick travelers into thinking the hotel is actually decent, but this is all a lie. As soon as you get off the elevator to your room, the hallway is dim, carpets are old, walls need painting, and it smells musty. The rooms themself are literally a few feet larger than the bed and the bathroom was just mediocre and extremely old fashioned. The bath faucet dripped loudly the entire stay, there was hardly any counter space above the sink, and they barely supply enough soap for one use. At night, there was this disturbingly loud creaking noise which seemed to be coming from the pipes or air conditioning vents which kept us awake.

I’ve stayed in plenty of hotels that trade in nostalgia and have been much nicer and better kept up. -tiniest hotel room I’ve stayed in in a long time. Just a bed and a narrow walkway to the bathroom. -Not nearly enough towels provided. Found this out the hard way when I was dripping wet and my husband had to call down for more towels. Took almost an hour for them to be delivered. -the bathroom has no fan or ventilation. This means after you shower the whole bathroom and everything in it is literally dripping wet from the condensation. Towels, toilet paper, any toiletries you had. It’s literally like standing in a cave with water dripping down on you. Horrible. -no counter in the bathroom, just a standing sink, so no place to store toiletries. -we were supposed to have a room with a view and did not. You can see a sliver of the MSG if you lean all the way against the corner of the window, otherwise we’re looking at walls of other buildings. The family we were traveling with had a beautiful view of the Empire State Building, so I guess it’s a crap shoot. -on the bed they only provided 1 sheet and 1 very thin blanket, no comforter or quilt or anything. Kind of ridiculous considering it’s November. Did call down to get extra blankets and again it took about an hour. -any time I had to have something delivered to the room (blankets and towels) it was a 10 min wait on the phone and an hour for delivery.

The queen metro room ( paid extra for a view) whilst small was very clean and tidy and actually very comfortable - no issue with house keeping or the condition/apperance ( Room 3303).Yes some of the corridors are a little outdated but it has an art deco feel that cannot be replicated with modernisation.

The room was dark as we were facing another part of the hotel, only feet away. They have rented out several floors to student accomodation which again is very strange for a 4star hotel and means at some times there is excessive noise.

No real sense of service, always a mobbed front lobby, aged hallways, small rooms with no coffee makers or bathroom shelf space, old tub fixtures and huge ""facility"" fee. Mandatory $34.08 per day for ""free"" internet, gym and business center. So you're getting a 3 star (maybe 3.5 on a good day) hotel for well over 2 Benjamins a day. The better part: Redone lobby with several restaurants and bars attached. A mildly interesting museum on the when this was a grand hotel. The fixtures in the bedroom and bath, except the tub, have been renovated. The bed is quite comfortable and there are blackout curtains. The internet works well and housekeeping is attentive of the ""Do Not Disturb""/""Please Make Up Room"" door tag. A nice flat screen, lots of hangers, an iron and ironing board. No fridge but an ice machine down the hall. Decent climate control. I asked for a quiet room and got one. Don't touch the bottled water - it's unconscionably expensive.All around, it was what I was looking for, without a single extra beyond the basics I expected, at a bit more than I thought I should pay.

Whenever you need to engage with them for anything they act as if you’re a bother. I asked about why our wifi said that we were only getting 200 mb of internet per day after paying an exorbitant $45 resort fees which states fast internet on their site. The person at reception said he didn’t know, so he went to ask his manager and he didn’t know either. So he gave me the number of the internet provider they use and said I could call them and ask if I want to! Unbelievable. My son’s suitcase was lost in LA but was found and was arriving in NY the next day. When I went to ask if it had arrived the disinterested reception worker said no it’s not here and almost didn’t believe me when I told her it should be there. I called Qantas and they assured me it was delivered. I went back and told them, she still argued that it’s not there and that they couldn’t find a matching name on the system. Well the room isn’t going to be in my teenage sons name is it??!! The rooms are very dated, no kettle is provided, bathrooms are like something from 1945 original. The location is very central although a seedier part of NY. There’s heaps of negative reviews and most are about the rude front of house staff. The management replies with the same cut and paste response to all of them and they don’t seem to care. The whole place lacks warmth and I don’t think I saw even one worker smiling.

This hotel is fantastic and the staff are AMAZING! We stayed for 8 nights and have to say the hotel location, staff and experience added to our wonderful trip. Staff members Samira and Driss were fantastic. Kept an eye on us all week to make sure we were enjoying our stay and always gave us great advice and tips to improve our New York experience. Honestly they went above and beyond what they needed to. I travel and use many hotels, and I have to say their customer service was one of the best I've received in recent times. There was also a female concierge, whose name I forgot to jot down (sorry) she also gave us some unique tourist tip ideas which allowed us to see things in New York that we couldn't find from generic websites. The hotel is great. If you're after a seven star type hotel at sky high prices, then this ain't for you. But if you want a nice clean friendly hotel with character in a superb location at a reasonable price, then this has to be number one! I read some comments saying it's 'dated'...I can see why they'd say that, but I'd have to say it kind of adds to its character. It has that feeling of what you see in the movies and it's unique in it's own way. The views from rooms I'm sure must be amazing as it's on the corner of 8th & 34th Street. We had fantastic views, which meant we didn't have to pay to go in to multiple skyscrapers to get the views. (Apart from Empire State Building, we paid to go in there).The location is fantastic, opposite Madison Sq Gardens. Subway Station right outside the door, walking distance to most major tourist spots. I could type all day about how great our experience was in New York and I'd have to say the hotel and staff definitely made sure our experience got off to a great start and then some. It's a very busy hotel, but staff are very efficient in dealing with it. But I can see they must get some miserable people in there demanding the world and probably don't have the energy to give them the experience we got. We went in with a smile and the staff definitely appreciated it. :)Highly recommend New Yorker! And once again, thank you to the hotel and staff for a great experience.","Manchester, United Kingdom","Yid1882</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

Room not ready on arrival which was fine as we were early, charged $5 per suitcase to store them, not impressed with that, rooms in NYC are expensive so to charge extra for storing luggage is outrageous. Was allocated a room on 31st floor, not executive and so small you couldn’t swing a mouse in there let alone a cat. Tiny window in corner of room, certainly not a view. Back to reception and told them the room was not acceptable as not what we had booked and paid for. We were given a room in 18th floor which was an executive and did have a view...but only 1 double bed. Back to reception for 3rd time, by this time I had steam coming out of my ears. We were then told they had no executive rooms left, even though that is what had been booked and paid for so we had no other option other to accept a standard room on 27th floor, no view. The room was very dated, bathroom something out of 1950s, no soundproofing from outside or adjoining rooms. TV had very poor signal, noisy air conditioning. Staff had a don’t care attitude. I had to return to reception to ask for the difference between the the cost of the room we had paid for and the one we ended up with, to be refunded, of $75 per night. They refused and said it would only be refunded at the end of the stay. It has finally been credited back to me 3 days after checking out. Again on check out had to store luggage as flight was not until late, so another $5 per suitcase (this applies to ANY item you leave, even if it is a carrier bag or a poster etc).This is a 2-3 star hotel at best with rude staff, long wait for lifts every time.

Rooms were a bit small, but very quiet and adequate for our use. Bathroom was small as well. Everything worked properly and was very clean. Only downside is there was no shelving in bathroom. Good water pressure in shower and with sink and toliet all in working order. Hair dryer worked as well. Closet was nice to have to hang clothing and store suitcases. The bed & pillow was a bit more firm than what I like but was more comfortable than other places I've stayed. One downside was we couldn't keep the a/c fan on constantly as background noise. Room was very quiet. The little museum display downstairs was nice. It would be even more ideal if there was an opportunity for a tour of the hotel where the tunnel, ballrooms, etc were once at. I know many areas are in need of repair but maybe a future idea? The on-site Italian restaurant was great and so was the diner! Didn't get a chance to check out the steakhouse there but maybe next time. One downside was an early check-in fee for trying to check in 2 hrs early and the baggage storage fee was a bit disappointing. There should've been some type of discount for rewards members or guests with reservations. Other than that, the hotel is in a wonderful spot located close to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, Macy's and not far from Times Square, NBC, Rockefeller Center, etc. Would I stay here in the future? Most definitely. Only thing I would change on my end is my timing on arrival so I wouldn't have to pay the extras. I paid $20 for 4 bags ($5 each) to be stored for a few hrs and then another $50 to get into the room early (as it was pouring outside and there was nowhere to go in the rain)and was charged more city taxes on top of early check in.

We booked a package holiday and our flights were correct so clearly this wasn’t our fault however we were treated as though it was. We were advised they needed to put a $300 hold on my credit card for a new room and for the inconvenience we would be upgraded. Went up to our room on the 25th floor, if that room and floor was an upgrade I would have hated to see where we were originally booked, as soon as you step out of the lift the brown frayed carpets greet you, along corridors reminiscent of The Shining we went in to a tiny and dated room, I know rooms in NYC aren’t going to be massive but when I have had a nightmare checking in and an extra $300 held on my credit card on top of what I had already paid for the ‘privilege’ of staying there I did expect better. Anyway we went back to reception and complained at what we had been given considering the messing around and extra charges and were upgraded to a 31st floor room, which, if I had been there first and not seen the other floor I probably wouldn’t have thought the hotel was that bad. The carpets seemed fairly recently done although they looked like it had been some time since they had been vacuumed, it was generally a much nicer floor and a much better room. On our journeys in the lift it seems like they may be doing up the hotel from the top down and any floor below the 30th you’ll be in trouble. We were told to return to reception the next day for an update on our $300 dollars being released, which we did, after another long wait while she disappeared to talk to her manager, we were told by an indifferent woman on reception who couldn’t be bothered to look at us while she fiddled about with something under the counter, that our money still wasn’t being released. After telling her I wasn’t going to keep coming to reception half an hour a day to sort this out the manager appeared and told us it was Virgins fault and he would let us know when our money was released. I contacted our Virgin rep who got on to them straight away and then forwarded to me the email the hotel had sent to them, in which the hotel apologised for THEIR error and said our money had been released and we would be given complimentary breakfast. The next morning we went to reception to collect the complimentary breakfast vouchers which the receptionist knew nothing about because the manager hadn’t put them on our room, after again disappearing into the back to speak to a manager they were given to us. I feel that the way the staff treated us and they way they dealt with the entire issue was not what you expect from a hotel of this grading, age and reputation and certainly not what you usually experience of American hospitality. We told reception about 3 times we were there to be married in New York and we didn’t want the stress of not having a room to stay in and not once was anything done to try and make this issue smoother, not once did staff offer any congratulations. They made it so that I hated going back to that hotel after brilliant days out in such a fabulous city. A woman had banged her head outside after checking out, I heard a man from a bus dropping off guests saying once you check out of that hotel they couldn’t care less, well they don’t care while you are checked in either. There is nothing in the room in the way of drink making facilities, no complimentary water in your room when you arrive, the toiletries are minimal. Basics you would expect in a 4 star hotel. The location is ideally placed in midtown for the subway to get to lower Manhattan and up to Central Park. We walked comfortably from the hotel to Times Square, Grand Central, Empire State Building, Rockefeller Centre.

I had to call my bank to cancel the one of the double charge. Despite the rude and threatening reception, I would also mention that the hotel charge you a ""resort"" fee of U$ 39, despite absolutely nothing is offered for this service (not even a small fridge or even a single coffee).

Not far from subway to getting around is simple.The view. Holy moly. The view (37th floor) was uh-maze-ing. I stay in the city, usually, a few times a year and this was probably the best view I've had of the skyline. Splurge the extra few bucks for the view, if you have the chance. The staff. Was very friendly.Wifi was good. No issues when I was using it in lobby or in the room.The bed. I slept well. The Average:The room size. Typical NYC room. Not spacious, but didn't need it. If I were staying on business and needed room to spread out, I'd not get the ""Queen"" room. Kind of noisy through the walls, or door. I could hear other guests when they were being a little loud. Wasn't terrible.Lobby is very very busy. No extra pillows in the closet. Usually, places I stay have an extra pillow or two in there.The Bad:No coffee maker in the room. No fridge in room.No bellhop!

I say this is ""bad"" since I prefer to tip someone a couple bucks to hold my bags. Overall, enjoyed it.

The room was very clean & quite, as was the bathroom. The bathroom also had nice, quality Bumble & Bumble ammenties stocked in it for our use.

We had a Metro View Queen, and I could have reached out from the open door and touched the bed. The closet had a luggage rack, but there was nowhere to unfold it. Cons---The Wyndham Resort sales pitch. This happened right after check in, when a man at what I thought was an information desk waved me over and asked if I wanted information. After a couple of minutes, we untangled ourselves and avoided that area. Another woman on a different day tried to get us interested in it as well. -This hotel badly needs some TLC. The carpets in the room and in the hallways are old and show it. The bathroom has no fan or vent, leading to a lot of mildew and the bathroom door not fitting properly in its frame. Paint is peeling around the windowsills.-The overhead light fixture had cobwebs all over over it.

Iconic hotel and highly rated - it was bound to be good!! We arrived early, we got into NYC at 11am so made our way to the hotel and arrived at the hotel at 1ish. Knew we couldn’t check in till 4pm so asked where we can leave our bags. I wasn’t expecting a $5 per bag charge, and it’s $5 even for a carrier bag. Doesn’t matter if you attach it to your suitcase they still charge you for it. That was very disappointing to see. I’ve traveled a lot and never been charged to leave suitcases. We went off around NYC and returned about 4:30. Reception was busy, the “trainee” who was stood watching didn’t crack any sort of smile. Shrugged her shoulders when asked a question. Herbert however we spoke to and dealt with was excellent. Very very friendly and really helpful. You have to show your key card everywhere you go in the hotel, we couldn’t even get in the lift without showing it and despite both being together we both had to get our card keys out. Bathroom is very very small. Don’t be expecting to swing a cat because you can’t. The beds though extremely comfy and plenty storage space! We were told when it came to our last day for a minimal charge we can have late check out - that minimal charge is $100 until 6pm! That’s not a minimal charge. That’s almost the cost of another nights stay. Check out again you pay to store your bags. Make sure you put all your shopping bags in your suitcase!! I also think students must occupy a few of the floors as the lift kept stopping and the doors opened onto what can only be described as a student looking crack den. Not what I expect to see from a 5* iconic luxury hotel. Penn station is right outside so that’s very handy and Tick Tock diner is open 24:7 which again very handy. I think there’s more iconic hotels in NYC and closer to Times Square. Staff disappointing. All the extra charges should be avoided.

I'm now re-thinking that. This was my first stay since it became a Wyndham, and some of the problems aren't Wyndham's fault. To list the ones that are first: I was walking to the elevator when a guy behind a desk asked me if i knew about the free breakfast, which started at 9. I told him I had to be up earlier and he suggested I change my train reservation. Not going to happen. I was then given a hard sell for Wyndham resorts, which I didn't appreciate. The room was fine, but (and this isn't Wyndham's fault) construction suddenly started up, making it very hard to sleep. It stopped a 5am. Next problem might have been Wyndham's fault: I awoke the next morning to find a guy passed out in the hall. I told a concierge downstairs about this and they sent somebody. But the security to get to the elevators has always been quite strict, so I wonder how he got there. I heard someone ask him if he were guest at the hotel and he said no. Another thing that is definitely Wyndham's fault was my inability to connect to the wi-fi. The fact that there was a button on the room phone specifically for this problem wasn't a good sign. I spent two hours with the guy on the other end and nothing got solved. He told me the chief engineer would call me back. He never did. Wyndham need a better wi-fi provider. On the way back from Canada, I drew another hotel from a booking site that was less expensive, and I may try for it next time. The Wyndham, at over $300 for the night, wasn't worth it.
