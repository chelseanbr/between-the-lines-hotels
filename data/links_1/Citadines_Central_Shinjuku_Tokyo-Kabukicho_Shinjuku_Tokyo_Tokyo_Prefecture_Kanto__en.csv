One of the front desk agents helped us make a reservation in Japanese at an amazing sushi restaurant. We think it was the best meal of our lives so we were very grateful for their gracious help.The location of the hotel can't be beat with Shinjuku station just a short walk away. There's a Lawson convenience store right downstairs if you need anything, and the Golden Gai with plenty of bars is right behind the hotel. The neighborhood is lively and vibrant but the inside it's quiet and relaxing. Our room was a decent size and VERY clean.

And they put on a pretty good breakfast (actually the best we had in Japan).Otherwise, it's tired and shabby, rooms are small and really old and run-down.We've stayed in Citadal hotels (in Germany) before which was why we booked here - and it was overall a rather unpleasant stay - we almost considered moving hotels but we had paid 100% upfront and didn't play to spend a lot of time indoors, so just rolled with it.Our arrival - late at night - was by taxi - dropped off across the road and into a rather strange ""gangster"" environment - we later learned there is Nigerian group who operate there (and from the golden Gia) and try to lure in drunk tourists - offering free drinks and other things and then later try to swindle them. Needless to say, it wasn't a great first impression and I think the hotel is aware of this, but powerless to control what happens outside their establishment, not really their fault, but it impacted on our experience.Once we got into our room, it was small and dingy - shabby and tired. We could have overlooked what was going on outside, but the room seemed to support the first impression and we felt sullied. We also didn't enjoy the Golden Gai which was 1 minute walk away - probably great for drinkers/smokers but the tiny little pubs felt claustrophobic, dirty and not really ""our thing"".Positives: the hotel was super central - we could walk everywhere and enjoyed the Samurai Museum the next day (5 minutes away) and the Robot Restaurant (also 5 mins but we didn't go in) and other attractions.The hotel also allowed us to experience the ""seedy"" side of Tokyo which is a part of any big city - so that ""enhanced"" our experience. We were glad to stay in Ginza when we returned from Kyoto.There was a 7/11 store downstairs - open 24 hours - where we could buy snacks and drinks.Tokyo is AMAZING though so if this is all you can afford, then it is what it is, but I;'m pretty sure there are other places at the same price that would be better. Citadel should look into this hotel bringing down their otherwise good reputation.","Cape Town Central, South Africa","Candice C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cape Town Central, South Africa</strong>",23,3.0

The hotel is situated about a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station - although this is convenient we found at times buses were easier to access (only a 3 or 4 minute walk) and quite often found ourselves needing to take a quick taxi to get back from the station to the hotel to save our legs after a long day of exploring.Although staying near Shinjuku station was handy- it was a very crowded station and a lot of the areas in Tokyo took a long time and multiple trains to reach.The room itself was perfectly fine for two people - a little cramped but comfortable and clean, a reasonable size. The bed was little uncomfortable and small (they only have a double size- no queen or king) but we found were able to sleep pretty well...Our deal included breakfast which was nothing special but was able to provide a decent meal for us to start the day.The hotel staff - although not overly pleasant were able to help with all our needs and generally spoke good English.Overall, a nice stay and introduction to the hustle and bustle of Tokyo, I wouldn’t stay here again but that had more to do with the location rather than the quality of the hotel..","Melbourne, Australia","livefortravel1988</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",5,4.0

The room is quite cleaning, the toilet and shower is quite big than other Hotel in this price range. The Hotel Facility is pretty good, near subway exit just few minutes and close to shinjuku but far away the noise. Since there is another Citadines in Shinjuku Gyo-en, front desk will give you the small map and pinned the Hotel location. However, one of the Hotel frontdesk that make me wont come this Hotel again. Most of the front desk can use english to communicate. When i go to hotel to check in, I realized that made the mistake to reserve the double room for 2 of my family member to stay. I told the front desk that i have request twin bed in the order and i have not received any reject from Hotel. The front desk is very impolitely and impatient to answer me that Hotel have reviewed my request but not accept. First, i accept i have made the mistake in the booking. However, i think Agoda have introduced the better way for communication between Hotel and client. When Hotel reviewed the request and decide the request is unable to fulfill, Hotel can send the email to client, or informally just send the message via Agoda? I think it is very common in servicing industry. This matter is my fault but I actually mad on the attitude of the front desk, i cant remember his face and how he impolite to provide his ""service"" to me even it is from Jan 2019. Just not saying the Hotel servicing, i dont think he is up to standard for doing the service job. Actually i dont know why he need to use this attitude to the client or just to me? Then, i just ask him how much to upgrade the double room to twin bed, the upgrade price is more than the original price of Double room booking. After that, when i have something to ask frontdesk, i will wait for other front desk, they are quite nice.",,vincentli_119,0,1.0

Great when travelling for a long period.The major downside though was the location in the evening. It is next to Golden Gai so you can expect some noise, but the amount of touts trying to get you into massage parlours or 'gentleman's clubs' was ridiculous.

Citadines is located on the respectable side of the street overlooking girly bars and a block back , a benign street devoted to picking up ladies, and a block further on the fun street featuring a roaring Godzilla. In short, this is a great location for the light-hearted.Our room was excellent with ample room for a king-size bed and a small couch. The TV offered a very limited range of English language programs, but that’s not why we were in Japan. At the back of the hotel, across a delightful pedestrian walk there was an area full of tiny bars, some with a cover charge and some without. These bars only opened in the evening and most were only big enough for about 6 patrons at a time. We went to one for a drink and sat at a bar with no room between the bar and the wall to push our stools back, and with a sign reading “All drinks 500 yen”.The breakfast provided in the airy dining room as part of the tariff was excellent and plentiful. The staff both in Reception and the Restaurant were helpful, friendly and efficient.It’s hard to fault this hotel as a mid-range ($300+) place to be based in Tokyo and its location, close enough to the mighty Shinjuku Station, makes access to anywhere in Tokyo a matter of ease.","Brisbane, Australia","Warner D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",62,4.0

Golden Gai is literally on your doorstep, and the famous Landmarks of Shinjuku such as the Godzilla statue (3 minutes) and the Robot Restaurent (1 minute) are so close. The nice thing is when going shopping you can quickly nip back into the hotel to drop off your bags and then go out again to buy some more. For a tourist who wants to be in the middle of the hussle and bussle this is a great location. If anything, the location was a bit TOO good on the Friday night - as we were by Golden Gai I could hear a lot of drunk people singing at around 3-4am whilst trying to sleep. But if you're a deep sleeper or are going to be out until that time yourself then this shouldn't bother you. Note, there are two Citadines in Shinjuku, if you want to be at the heart of Shinjuku stay in this one - the other one takes about 10 minutes walk. The room itself felt dark and slightly dingy, had no charm to it. It was merely ok. Size wise it was a little small, but considering this is Tokyo it was actually bigger than I had expected. Check-in wasn't smooth, arrived from my Ginza hotel at 11am and instead of just saying ""sorry, room isn't available until 2pm"" they kept on saying ""10 more minutes, 10 more minutes"" so I ended up sitting there for an hour wasting my time so managing expectations isn't their strong point.

The same receptionist asked if we're gonna stay if he moves us to a ""really large room"" for no additional cost ($60 increase still on), which I said would consider if I see it first, not moving any luggage anymore. He showed us the room, which was still bad, but I decided it's acceptable at this point. The pictures that I'm uploading are from the ""largest"" room, as I didn't even take pictures of the smaller ones.The room was with below average furniture, but clean enough and with some amenities inside. The bed wasn't one large bed but two 1.5 beds instead. Nothing else to say, wasn't terrible but wasn't good as well. Bathroom is OK.The location of the hotel is somewhat convenient, as it's close to a metro station and a few key areas. However, it's in the middle of, what I can only describe as, ""funny neighborhood"", with many many weird clubs and weird people around. We didn't feel very good there, nor we felt safe. I know it's safe in Japan, but there were some questionable people on the street who were not Japanese at all. And they were quite pushy trying to get us in a club or whatever.Not only I advise everyone reading this to find another hotel, but please consider staying in a different area altogether.Disclaimer: I'm aware hotels in Tokyo are small. This, however, was too small for the price they demanded. When I book ""deluxe studio"" or whatever, I expect at least space to open my suitcase. They only reason I'm rating it 2/5 and not 1/5 is because after all we did get a human-sized room, so I guess it could be worse.","Plovdiv, Bulgaria","VKonsulov</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plovdiv, Bulgaria</strong>",68,2.0

My judgment might be clouded though as after 12 hours of travelling, no sleep and then half a day of sightseeing the jetlag took its toll.

We had breakfast included in our hotel package, and the breakfast buffet provided was excellent — a great selection of Western food and traditional Japanese fare. The location was great — within short walking distance to the Shinjuku shopping areas, Samurai Museum, Golden Gai, Robot Show, etc. — and only a 10-minute walk to the Shinjuku station. Pretty much everything comes into/leaves from the Shinjuku station (subway, JR lines, Shinkansen, Odakyu lines if taking a day trip to Hakone, etc.), so this is a great perk. Word to the wise: The Shinjuku station itself is huge and a bit of a maze, so give yourself time to explore and figure out the layout. There are east and west entrances to the station and certain things are only accessible on one side of the station (i.e. the subway is on the east side and the Odakyu lines are on the west side).The only con I can think of is the comfort of the hotel bed — mattress and pillows were a bit thin/firm by Western standards.

The bathroom was fine but a bit odd. A creative attempt had been made to update the bathroom by placing glass screening around the bath enabling you to shower next to the bath rather than needing to stand in it. Good thinking but it was all a bit different and not particularly practical. Water pressure and water temperature though, were excellent.Breakfast was included within our tariff.

Both rooms are cozy, but we didn't find them too tight for two people with a suitcase and backpack each (we are also used to city living though). There were not many noticeable differences between the two, both rooms were non-smoking and clean. The Studio Deluxe Double had a larger bathroom with a large tub and separate shower, but the bedroom was a little tighter. The Studio Double had a smaller bathroom with a shower/tub combo and more walking room in the bedroom.

The Citidines Central Tokyo didn't really live up to the reviews.The area:First, I will start by saying, my husband & I chose Shinjuku to stay based on the different attractions we wanted to see. It is true that Shinjuku is a great city in Tokyo and is pretty safe. However, you must keep in mind that this particular hotel is located in the heart of the Red Light District. This location is good for those that want to bar hop (Golden Gai), see casinos, etc. Central Shinjuku is a lot like Vegas. With that comes smoking in hotel rooms and bars. If you don't mind this, you will probably like this hotel a bit more.One annoyance of staying in Central Shinjuku is the people who come up to you on the street with solicitation. You will hear announcements that this is illegal in Tokyo but people still do it. There are men that try to coax you into bars which you should always say no to. We did see some women going into a bar with 2 of them and we read that this is when you get solicited to pay more for food/drink and they won't allow you to leave until you pay for the escalated costs. It is true that the area is pretty safe. I will say the business district on the other side of the train station is much better, more serene, and friendly. The room:The hotel room was small and was dirty. We booked a double-bed room for our last night in Tokyo. (We did stay at the Hyatt Tokyo our first 3 days and then went to Kyoto for a few days and this was our last stop.) The bed was against a wall which was ok however, there were liquid marks on the wallpaper close to where your head hits the pillow which was kind of gross. Second, the carpet was dirty and the showerhead in the bathroom had black mold on the head. The room also smelled very heavily of smoke and we were in what was a non-smoking area. The room is very small if you book a standard. Both of use barely had room to move and there was limited room for our suitcases. If you are use to traveling to Europe, this may not bother you as much. Overall, I rated this room a 2 based on the fact it isn't a true 4 star property and the reviews are a little misleading as to what you get. This is purely based on our stay and our experience. This may be a good choice for you but do your research first before booking.",,Christine S,5,2.0

We had originally booked into an AirBnB apartment that has a nice view of Mt Fuji. Unfortunately, there was a clamp down on AirBnB wef 15 Jun.. Although our booking was for a period prior to 15 Jun, we were unable to contact the Host for almost 24 hours. We tried getting AirBnB to contact to confirm that we would still have a place to stay in upon arrival. Up to the day we were supposed to take off, we rec'd no response from the host. IMagine our anxiety. AirBnB was very helpful and wanted to replace with another apartment. Unfortunately, most host had delisted their apartments and the few left did not have good reviews. Thus, AirBnB agreed to give us a full refund. With little hours before take off, we randomly booked a hotel in Shinjuku. This was the Citadines Central Shinjuku.The trip from Narita airport to the hotel was quite smooth. It was about a 10 mins walk from the JR station to the hotel, with luggage. Wasn't too difficult to find with a GPS on hand. We were pleasantly greeted by the hotel staff. The male staff was very helpful and polite. We asked for a late check-out 6 days later and he advised that we signed up for a online member and could then check out at 2pm. We did that over the counter. The whole check in process was very pleasant and welcoming. Although the official check in time was 4pm, the room was available for us at 1pm. It was a relief after a tiring flight where a couple of kids cried throughout the night onboard the flight. Breakfast was simple but sufficient. There was a variety and even and omelette station. Selection of bread and juices were good though I wish the breakfast could start earlier instead of at 7am. There were 2 days where we were rushing for an early train ride to Kyoto and Osaka and couldn't have breakfast.The lobby is on the 3rd floor. Take the lift up is the easiest if you have luggages with you.Just on the ground floor, there is Lawsons, selling nice rice balls, drinks and cup noodles. Just a few steps away, you will find 711, where there is a wider selection of bentos, ready to cook meals and fabulous rice balls. At the corner of the street, there is donut cafe if you need a quick bite. The hotel is situated near uniqlo, isetan and shops where you could get your duty free cosmestics...like watsons. A very convenient place indeed.Room was cozy and very clean. Housekeeping everday and they have a laundry area if you need to wash and dry your clothes (7th floor). Room was a bit small but sufficient for 2 luggages. Most importantly was, it was very clean and everything you need can be found either in the room or the bathroom eg. toileteries, towels.Though the hotel is situated in Shinjuku, it is relatively safe to walk the streets at night. Though there were 'bouncers' situated outside some joints, they usually don't harress you if you are in a group or with a partner. Overall a very pleasant stay.

The hotel itself was fairly clean with decent furnishings and there is a 7 eleven literally next door. It can be a bit noisy at night because of its location but that didn’t bother us. We didn’t use the hotel restaurant for breakfast but we did eat at the udon restaurant on the floor below reception and it was one of our favourite meals during our stay so I would recommend eating there.

Exiting the hotel you have to take the elevator from the third floor to the first. I had no problem checking in or out as all of the desk personnel spoke English and explained everything thoroughly. As far as the room, it was a decent size for one person but as other guests have mentioned the size is small by American standards. I kept my suitcase on the couch so it wasn't in the way. The only things lacking were the T.V. and mini-fridge. The channels on the T.V. weren't really an assortment of things to watch and the only English speaking channels were news and discovery channel. I didn't spend much time in the room but it would've been nice to watch something interesting on the evening it rained or while settling in for the night. The mini-fridge also didn't seem to get cold at all. The bathroom did it's job completely and I had no issues with it. Every once in a while I'd get whiffs of cigarette smoke out the a/c vent from another room in the hotel but it wasn't enough to really inconvenience me.The location is perfect if planning on going to the Golden Gai and it's right on the edge of the red light district and the train station is about a 10 minute walk away.","Corpus Christi, Texas","Antoine L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Corpus Christi, Texas</strong>",4,4.0

It was a bit of a walking distance to the train station as well but I didn't mind the walking as walking is better as you tend to discover interesting stuff in odd corners when travelling to new places. The room we were in was a bit tiny but I have been told that most hotels in Japan have tiny rooms anyway. Interestingly, we were in another hotel after this one (which did not differ much in price) but the room was spacious in that other hotel. The bed was against the wall so one of us (who was sleeping on the side against the wall) had to crawl to the end of the bed if you want to use the toilet in the middle of the night.

The husband who would just wait for me at a distance would notice that I get ignored and would often step in. Overall, will not stay there again as because the noise only seems to subside after 4 in the morning.

That’s because we stayed here twice: 5 nights and then 3 nights with a week in between.The things is... we had a ‘Deluxe Double’ the first time we were here and by accident, a ‘Standard Double’ the second time, which we much preferred.To explain...The floor space is the same, but because the ‘Deluxe’ has an upgraded and separate shower recess (not over the bath) the bathroom space eats into the bedroom. Result: the bedroom in the ‘Deluxe’ is about 800 mil shorter than in the ‘standard’ and when the room is a compact size to begin with (as Japanese hotel rooms tend to be) you really feel the difference. The ‘standard’ room has an expanded desk and bedside table - and hence more ‘livable’ space. I guess it’s a matter of personal choice: modern shower or more space.In all other regards, it’s hard to fault Citadines Central. The location is superb. Right in the heart of Shinjuku... eateries and department stores all around - and about 8 mins walk to the massive Shinjuku station.The staff are very obliging and the housekeeping standards are first rate. There’s a guest laundry on the 7th floor (coin in the slot) and they offer a pretty good breakfast for about 1300 yen. Rooms are also stocked with quality toiletries, bath robes, coffee and tea, and a small fridge. I recommend a high floor with a city view, as opposed to Shinjuku street view.","Gold Coast, Australia","PANTHER029</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast, Australia</strong>",534,5.0

After doing extensive research on hotels, I chose this hotel for our last 2 nights in Tokyo. It is about a 10 minute walk from the JR station which wasn't a problem at all even with all of our luggages. I booked through Hotels.com and paid $400 for a total of 2 nights which isn't bad considering we went during cherry blossoms. There are laundry machines, breakfast buffet, and I believe a gym at this hotel. There is a Lawson located right below the hotel which is so convenient for any basic needs.There is a big Citadines sign that you won't miss from the street. From there you will take an elevator up to the 3rd floor for the hotel lobby. Upon arrival,we were warmly greeted by the staff. I had requested to get a room on a higher floor when I made the reservations. They happily accommodated us! I believe we were 12th floor. We never felt unsafe even though our hotel is located right by Golden Gai and because our room was located so high up we barely heard any of the noises. On our last day the hotel happily stored our luggages even after we've checked out so we could explore the city for a couple more hours before our flight.Our deluxe double room, while small compared by Western standards, is normal for Japanese standards and actually perfect for both my boyfriend and I. I'm a fan of the bathroom which was bigger than I expected. The room is also extremely CLEAN! Housekeeping does an excellent job daily. 2 water bottles are restocked daily.

Once was by a pimp and another time it was either for drugs or sex. So it's a seamy walk on that street. Fortunately there is a back path into the hotel entrance that is quite calm and charming.

We booked very early, about 11 months before arrival and got a great rate. About CAD$290 a night all service charge and taxes included for 3 adults without breakfast. The room was large enough for 3 adults with a king bed that was absolutely comfortable on the form side with an European duvet. Crisp linen and everything smelling fresh and clean. Our adult son slept on the sofa bed with 2 extra mattress toppers and duvet which he didn’t seem to find too uncomfortable.The kitchen with a bar fridge, one stove top, kettle, toaster, and microwave came in so handy for making breakfast or nuking up bento boxes. There were 3 of everything from plates to wine glasses along with dish soap and rags given. The air conditioning is fantastic as it can provide both AC or heat and was very quiet.there was also enough lighting g and outlets for charging our devices. There was a tub along with shower and the Toto toilet with its washlet like bidet and heated toilet seat are a plus.Despite some people criticizing the location, we actually loved its location and here is why:1. 2 minute walk to 7/11 convenience store that sells fantastic meals, hot croquettes, desserts, and coffees that is excellent for 100 yen or 150yen for a large. The ATM machine also worked well without any problems using our Canadian bank card. The food quality of their meals are good and great selection.2. 3 minute walk to a Lawson’s 100 where almost everything is 100 yen before 8% tax. Here, the selection and quality of prepared meals are not as high as 7/11, but buying non meals are great. Small butter 100 yen, jam 100 yen, soba shout 100 yen, eggs and fresh bread 100 yen, chubby European wieners at 284 yen for 8 of them. It is so convenient buying small sized everything here for just 100 yen like salt/pepper, and small bottle of Japanese mayo and wasabi.There is no need to go to a super market and pay more money for the same items and they only have large portions.3. 5 minute walk to a very large and new western type super market that has very high quality of cooked meals, cheeses, bakery, meats, and produce, they open at 10am and closes late at 11 pm.4. 2. minute walk across the hotel to a take out restaurant called ORIGINS that sell many Japanese and Chinese deli items by weight and fresh to make bento boxes at very reasonable prices.5. many great little restaurants nearby like Yatsunoya chain, little soba joints, and cafes.6. 10minute walk to the nearest metro station, Shinjuku Gyoemmae, and a 15 mi Ute walk to another station called Shinjuku Sanchome.7. 20 minute walk to the main Shinjuku Station.The staff here all speak English and everyone is so helpful and polite.We used the washer which it automatically includes detergent for 300 yen a wash and the dryer does not dry clothes enough despite putting in 200 yen for one hour. Replacing the dryers with more efficient and more powerful ones would be perfect.There is a tiny gym with new treadmills but we did t use it because after having walked 6 to 8 hours a day, my feet were already killing me.There is a flat screen TV with many Chan else but only with limited English channels but there are movie channels in English.The room is extremely functional with many shelves, closets, and it is designed so that there are many places to put all your amenities. We love the Citadines Shinjuku and we will certainly return here to this property and we highly recommend it to all those who want a great value and a little kitchen.Thank you so much for an awesome stay Citadines,","Vancouver, Canada","cliu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",318,5.0

Easy to walk to from the Train station, even with luggage - possibly a bit tricky to find but several other reviews had mentioned how to find the hotel, so wasn't really an issue. The hotel itself is very clean, the rooms are cosy but have everything you need, the beds are really comfortable, the bathrooms are very spacious and very well designed with every amenity you would need. There is a guest laundry on the 7th floor which is very convenient. The staff are so friendly and helpful. There is a restaurant that was open for buffet breakfast, we weren't on a meal plan but had the breakfast there one morning for convenience- reasonably priced and a fair selection, again the staff very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again and wouldn't even bother looking for anywhere else to stay.

This hotel is located in the center of Tokyo's red light district so at night it can be quite rowdy and a ton of touts out and about. We arrived on a Saturday night so it was VERY busy and crowded. We were approached by touts even though we were a couple. Golden Gai is conveniently located right beside the hotel but it was too busy. Drinks avg. 800yen and some bars charge cover. I would drink elsewhere. The hotel is not on the main st. You must access it from either the escalator or elevator. Hotel also had a musky (old) smell when you first enter. It wasn't pleasant.Front night staff were okay - they asked to see our passports when we arrived and took them to their office for a brief moment. Not too sure for what purpose. If you stay on 11th floor or higher - room key is required for elevator. This was one plus. The rooms and bathrooms were dated. Bathroom was not really clean and it had a tub and a shower. The bed had a long piece of hair and was against the wall. The hotel did not have good sound proofing so we would hear people in the day and outside at night. Although conveniently located near Shinjuku station (second plus) I would not recommend this hotel for anyone staying in Tokyo. The hotel is dated and it gave us this uneasy feeling at night.

Now if you've looked into booking here, you'll of no doubt seen some reviews already, and if you haven't looked into some reviews, allow me to break it down.First the bad, but to be totally honest I didn't find it any trouble. Multiple reviews I've read list groups of black men hanging near the hotel, trying to get you into bars or what ever. Nobody approached me or my partner once, or even attempted to. Whilst I did notice the men, and a certain older lady who was hanging around the area every night, we had absolutely no trouble or ever felt in danger.Now the good. The hotel is very easy to find from the main Shinjuku station. (Look up the video on YouTube) Its very clean with no disturbances even with it being central to everything including Golden Gai. Fresh sheets, towel's, robe's and slippers every day. Tea, coffee and water replenished everyday also. Lawson's is literally on the doorstep!A little bonus tip when staying here and becoming more confident with the subway. Get off at Shinjuku Sanchome. If you come out Exit E2, or B2 I can't remember which but one brings you out next to the shrine. Its closer and easier to get back to the hotel than the main Shinjuku station. Overall when I return to Tokyo, I wouldn't think twice about rebooking. Great hotel, friendly staff and over all made the stay amazing. Also they somehow found out it was my birthday and left a little note and present. Great stay, more than I expected. Safe secure and enjoyable. Great breakfast options with Japanese mannerisms you'd expect in Japan. STAY HERE!!!! An no I'm not receiving anything for this long review, I just really enjoyed my stay and the hotel was so nice.",,Mitch W,20,5.0

It's worth mentioning as the web site pictures give an impression of spacious, airy rooms with plenty of natural lights and the reality is just one notch below that. There are two Citadines hotels in Shinjuku so make sure you chose the right one for your own requirements not least in terms of district and proximity to train and subway stations. Kabukicho is a lively district, apparently not enjoying a very good reputation with the locals, but all is relative and we have found it to be entirely safe, plus the presence of touts in the street is not the preserve of Kabukicho, you used to have quite a few in Akasaka as well. The Hotel is very well served in terms of subway, although it can be a nightmare to find the right exit and you will end up using Godzilla as a landmark to guide you. The rooms are generally nice if a bit tiny (but still not as tiny as other places such as the Mitsui City Garden) and the furnishings are a bit more tired that the web pictures would suggest. Rather quiet for the district, good bedding and functional bathroom. Friendly front desk.

However, overall, this is a minor issue.- The room is very well-equipped, with large and comfortable kingsize bed, television, safe, sofa, desk, WiFi, non-smoking (though smoking rooms are available), air conditioner, and all the usual amenities you'd expect to find in a hotel of this kind. Everything was spotlessly clean.- Despite the size of the room, the bathroom was very big (almost equal to the size of the room), with wetroom/bath/shower separated (and well-divided) from toilet/sink area.- The staff were excellent: very friendly, amenable, approachable, and very well-informed (in English). Our cab driver initially dropped us to the wrong Citadines hotel (a 15min walk or 3min cab drive from Citadines Central), the staff in the other hotel called a cab on our behalf and directed the new driver appropriately. I found the same level of helpfulness at Citadines Central.- The location is near-perfect for a hotel in central Tokyo. You're in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku. Despite this centrality, we had no issue with noise in our room. The view from the room was a magnificent high-rise cityscape.- Breakfast was very good.

The company travel agent got this hotel for a reasonable price (~24k JPY/night) which I thought was pretty reasonable. Since I am familiar with Shinjuku, I said go for it.Location wise, it's located just inside the Kabukicho area, which is the red light district of Shinjuku. Walking down the main street towards the hotel, you pass by many massage parlours and bars with suggestive pictures and names posted. Looks OK during the day, but by night, touts (and pimps) line the streets, looking for customers.For most part, the Japanese touts will ignore tourists. However, the many Nigerian touts are quite active and vocal in coming up to tourists, especially single men or groups of men, and to actively persuade you to try some of several establishments. For most part, I ignore, or shake my head and continue walking. If you engage in conversation, it will be hard to disengage later :)All in all, I still felt it was a fairly safe place, even walking around at night, though my colleagues' reactions when they knew where I was staying ranged from horror to amusement :)On the hotel itself, I would put it right up there with the best popular places in Shinjuku. It's definitely better than the Plaza Sunroute where we usually stay - rooms are huge by Tokyo standards (deluxe room), same with the bathrooms. You don't feel crowded at all here. There are convenient vending machines on most floors, and a set of 5 washing machines and driers on L7. Directly downstars is a Lawson's so it's super convenient to pick up something to eat (a Mister Donut is down the street, which closes at 2am if you're craving coffee and hotdogs).The showers/bath was excellent, the water pressure is one of the best I've experienced in any hotel and unlike the usual shower curtain, this is behind a glass shower door so you get zero splashes in the toilet areas (if you're particular about that).All in all, I love this hotel and will make it my hotel of choice next trip to Shinjuku. It's near all the shopping and food places we love, and a stone's throw from the Shinjuku Station. Will definitely return!","Singapore, Singapore","Gymrat76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",74,4.0

The hotel is 10 Minutes walk from Shinjuku station which is the centre of the universe and whilst this was convenient to travel anywhere in Tokyo, locating the East exit on returning was our biggest challenge of the day !

It is small but it didn't bother us because we will be spending most of our time outside anyways. And although small it is clean. It has a safe, iron board, mini ref, bathtub. There is however no coffee/tea maker. Housekeeping will tidy up your room daily and replenish your bottled water and toiletries.The best thing about Citadines Central is location. No doubt. Lawson is just on the ground floor of the building. Lots and lots of restaurants around. Drugstores are everywhere (here you will find tons of japanese makeups, masks, chocolates, and goodies that are so kawaii and cheap!). If you want to go shopping you'll find so many department stores around Shinjuku Station. And speaking of Shinjuku station, it is just 10 to 15 mins walk (Remember: East Exit. Follow the signs. Then go up the stairs to an exit that says ""Kabukicho""). You can also ride Narita Express from this station going back to Narita airport. It's really convenient.

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. One thing that I did look forward to was the location and the fact that there was a Lawsons convenient store on the street level in front. Oh, that place has some amazing snacks, drinks, and other various goodies. Not to mention the nonstop action of interesting people either sitting in the cafe area or just shopping for their own goodies. I saw a Japanese woman who looked like she was 7 feet tall reading the contents of a microwaveable ramen container. She had on very tall heels but nevertheless she was still super tall without. There's also a nearby 7-11 and this place that makes the best beef udon and also various kinds of Takoyaki right next door to the 7-11. Needless to say we did a lot of eating in Tokyo. The famous alley known as Omoide Yokocho wasn't too faraway. I discovered it while on a walk to see what places were nearby. My wife was resting on our first morning in Tokyo and sent me to scout out what was close by. Everything was close by! Be careful of getting carried away as you eat the yakitori in Omoide Yokocho because we almost didn't have enough to pay for everything we ate. Anyway, this hotel is truly centrally located but Tokyo has the most amazing subway system and thanks to the help of a friend(Nick) who lives there and who also works as a guide he was able to show us a great deal of the city. We were there for 4 nights, which is actually too short of time to take in all that Tokyo has to offer. We hope to return again very soon. The staff at Citadines Central was always very helpful and friendly. I'd heard of the rooms being very small but the size didn't bother me. Yes, they were somewhat small but I've seen much smaller in Europe. We loved our stay here.

The stench of cigarette smoke in the hallway was awful. Grouping floors as smoking and non-smoking would be better. Fortunately, you could not smell it once in the room.2. At check-in I asked about a twin room (booked a double). Although they had availability (we checked in quite late) they wanted an extra fee. In all my travels around the world, that is the first time that a 2 bed room was more money and that a hotel wouldn't accommodate when it was available.3. Minor annoyance to have to take 2 separate elevators to reach the street level.4. Staff wasn't able to give me directions for how to take the subway to Shibuya station (1 station away). Had to ask 3 people and they didn't know what the cost would be. Thankfully, I was able to catch an English speaking person at the subway station to help us (the ticket machines aren't really helpful, you need to know what the fare is ahead of time).OK...all that aside, our stay was fine. But given all the options in this city, I don't think I would return.Location - It's a great location. 10-15 minute walk from the Shinjuku station. If you have a phone with GPS, you can easily follow the map to navigate yourself. Streets are crowded, but it's Tokyo :) Lots of restaurants and stores around...but I think that no matter where you stay in this part of the city that you will find that.Staff - Interactions were mixed. Friendly, but not helpful re subway use or moving us to twin room.Room - Rooms looked new. The double room was small (bed up against the wall and a bit of room to walk around). They leave PJs on the bed (nice touch). Small, flat screen TV. Wifi was good for Facetime. Bed was comfortable but pillow was really hard. Bathroom - Well appointed. Japanese toilet (I love these!). Shower was a tub/shower combo. Good water pressure and temperature. Shampoo, conditioner, and body wash provided. Decent space to put your bathroom amenities around the sink. I probably wouldn't recommend this hotel for an extended stay for more than 1 person given the small room for the price.

Given that one would be out and about most of the day returning in the wee hours only to sleep we booked ourselves in for a 3 night stay here in September. One can easily enough make it down to hsinjuku station from Tokyo airport, there upon best to take a taxi the first time around which is what we did. The hotel is towards the beginning of Shinjuku and one doesn't have to venture in to the area if one chooses. Having said that mind you the 3 nights we were there there was nothing offensive or dodgy one ran in to and i would rate the hotel and the adjoining area perfectly safe for young families even let alone young couples or solo travellers. In fact Shinjuku has some pretty good restaurants and a host of bars and pubs abound. There are loads of convenience stores around the hotel as are a fair number of coffee and breakfast options. We arrived at about 11.00AM only to be told that our room wasn't ready as they become available only at 2.00, would have helped to have gotten one straight away given we had just come on a red fey 7 plus hour flight, however fair play to the hotel staff they played by the rules. We went for a short walk about and had an early lunch, when we got back at 1.00pm the room was ready. Sure it was tiny but sufficient for the 2 of us with enough space to plant our suitcase and unpack. The bathroom was small but again spotlessly clean and with all amenities. We didn't have breakfast or dine at the hotel at all so cant comment on the F&B. The hotel is barely a 7 minute walk away to the train station which was handy as well really made good use of the train service during our stay. The only grouse I guess I had about the hotel was that it was not comfortable, functional but not comfortable. Also I reckon one can do better and stay at Shubiya or around Rapponji.

Initially the hotel seemed like it would be easy to find from Shinjuku JR Station, but it was a little bit confusing until you get the hang of it. The room was quite small, even by Tokyo standards (not big enough to even open a suitcase on the floor); but the bathroom was nice and large. The room was very clean though. The buffet breakfast is fairly good here with a selection of various things which seem to change slightly each day.People seem to go on about it but the nearby Kabukicho area is nothing to worry about really, unless you left your common sense at home before travelling. The touts can get annoying too, but if you politely decline their offers (often multiple times) then they get the picture.In order to help some other people we noted the best way to navigate from JR Shinjuku Station to the hotel (looks harder than it is):- Exit out of the EAST GATE- Once out the gates, head left past the elevators down the stairs following the signs for the Tokyo Metro Maronouchi Line- Once down the stairs, follow the curved path down more stairs- You should enter a long concourse with many exits and large poles running down the middle. Turn right, but stay on the left-hand side.- At exit B10 ""Seibu-Shinjuku Line"" (there should be blue signs for the SUBNADE too)- Go down the stairs/escalators and continue along the corridors straight- When you can no longer go straight you will be in a room with five larger exits (one being behind you the way you came). The two on the left go towards Shinjuku nichome (marked with ２丁目) and the two on the right go towards Shinjuku sanchome (marked with 3丁目). Take the furthest away large exit on your right for Shinjuku sanchome.- Walk down the hallway until you see three silver/glass doors on your left. At the time of writing this they are next to Caffe Veloce (a dark red coffee shop).- Go through the doors, up the stairs straight ahead of you out to exit 15B.- As you come out the top of the stairs, cross the road to your right, continuing in the direction you exited the stairs.- Citadines Central Shinjuku is about a 100m down on your right.There are other ways but we used this all the time and it seemed to be the easiest/most convenient.Staff are friendly and helpful.You only get given one key - so I suggest getting another from the counter if you need it before going up to your room.Plenty of places to eat and drink around the place, and this hotel is right next door to the Golden Gai district! Very cool.We had a good stay here, but the room sizes make you feel like you aren't getting good value at times.

If you have a JR-Pass, it is extremely easy and convenient to travel by train, even with the Shinkansen.One day, we went on a trip around Kyoto - on which I happened to lose my cellphone. Back at Citadines, the team from the reception did everything to get my cellphone back. They actually had it sent overnight from Kyoto to the hotel and it arrived the next day at 10am. That's a service that is not usual and really amazed me.","Nanikon, Switzerland","RaffRene</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nanikon, Switzerland</strong>",8,5.0

The hotel itself is easy to locate and is only about a 4-5 minute walk from the Shinjuku Train Station, which is ideal if you are planning on using the trains. There are plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance, as well as a couple of cinemas, a samurai museum, and a couple of shrines.The hotel reception resides on the 3rd floor of the building, on the second is a nice restaurant, although slightly expensive, and the first has a Lawsons general store, making everything at arms length.

For families, it is not an ideal place as at night there is a street of bars on one side of the hotel and clubs on the other. However, there are many shops outside for convenience. We stayed for a total of 4 nights (2x 2 nights). The second check in took 2 hours because as a family, they gave us 2 rooms in 2 different floors.

We splurged a bit and got an ""Executive"" level room, and I think it was worth doing. We were on the 14th floor, and the room was spacious enough! It was definitely still tight, but that is just always going to be the case in Tokyo.We had two twin sized beds that were pushed together. There is a closet with a mini fridge (and two waters refreshed daily), and a small cabinet next to the bed housing a kettle with some coffee and tea options. The beds are quite firm, but softer than most Japanese hotel beds, and the duvets are quite soft. We had a small table with two chairs, and the chairs ended up housing our luggage, which were both carry-on sized bags. You might have a harder time with bigger bags.The bathroom was AMAZING. The shower room had a spacious tub with a window overlooking Kabukicho. The water pressure was fantastic. The hotel had two choices of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. The toilet is, like many places in Japan, very comprehensive. I am back home now and long for that bathroom...The room is air conditioned, though the lowest setting is 20 degrees which is supposed to translate to 68 Fahrenheit, but it just isn't. It's much warmer. If you need a room to be pretty cold for a comfortable sleep, this might not do it for you. They only give you one key (which controls the electricity for the room) but the air conditioning does seem to stay on for the day when you leave, which is a nice change from other rooms we've had in Asia and Europe. It sucks to get back from a hike and still be sweating in your room for a while! The hotel location is great. It's right on the edge of Kabukicho, and while I think everywhere we went in Japan is super safe, if you're leery of Kabukicho but want to be near Shinjuku, I think this gives you the best of both worlds. It's much closer to the train station than the other Citadines, and there's a Maranouchi Line stop that is just one block away. Otherwise, it's about a 5 (7 with luggage) minute walk to the main station. As other reviewers have mentioned, Golden Gai is spitting distance away. We were able to do laundry on the 7th floor (soap is automatic in the washing machine, in case you need to do some laundry yourself!) and I was able to enjoy the massage chairs and free coffee vending on the 13th floor while I waited for my laundry. The 13th floor is only accessible to the ""executive"" floor levels via key card, which is obnoxious, but I guess that and the extra space in the room made it worth it. The front desk was very helpful in making reservations for us for lunch and dinner, and held onto our luggage for a couple of hours our last day there.

There are also countless bars, restaurants and all manner of other amusements right at your doorstep - including the famous Golden Gai bar area.The hotel itself was very nice, the staff all spoke good English and provided the highest level of service throughout the two week stay. The room for two was surprisingly spacious by Japanese standards although still a little on the small side, with comfy beds, a plasma TV and a window overlooking the busy streets below - A higher floor of the building might be preferable as the night life can get noisy.Breakfast was free every morning and served from 7:00-10:30am, with a buffet providing Japanese food and more Western options. Each floor has a vending machine providing all manner of drinks (some alcoholic) and there are laundry facilities on the 7th floor.

We felt completely safe while walking through this area but it is a red light district and some of the seedier streets may not be suitable for families with children or women travelling alone or in small groups.One con is that the hotel is easy to miss if you're not looking for it, it is nestled in between some tall buildings without obvious signage.

Upon arrival we were shocked at how pathetically small the room was. This is Tokyo and we were aware rooms might be small but this was prison cell like and (based on a similar experience in Hong Kong once before with a different hotel chain) we quickly decided that it would be really depressing to stay in that room. The staff were very accommodating at finding us a more suitable room and we looked at a few. Most were just too small to be comfortable and/or stank of cigarette smoke - they were nominally non-smoking rooms but clearly the policy isn't enforced. We ended up with one of the rooms on the executive floor, which was quite large and comfortable. There was some smell of smoke, but it was manageable and we were out of options. Despite not being impressed with the rooms, I was impressed by the attitude of the staff. They were trying very hard to help and although they had to charge us to upgrade, they did this at well below list rates (we had initially paid around £100 a night and had to pay another £30 per night, but it was well worth it).After that our stay was largely uneventful. Breakfast was good, although one morning we had to wait to get into the dining room since there aren't enough tables at real peak time. Wifi was good. Location is great - Shinjuku is a wonderful place to stay with real atmosphere. Maybe some would consider it a little rough around the edges but it's all incredibly tame compared to anywhere you'd apply that sort of description to in Europe or the US.Overall we were satisfied. It ended up costing more than we would expect in most parts of the world for the quality you get, but conversely I think it cost less than the equivalent might generally cost in Tokyo.","Cambridge, United Kingdom","Mark C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, United Kingdom</strong>",308,4.0

The hotel is a 7 minute walk from the East entrance of Shinjuku train/metro which makes it an ideal base for visiting other parts of the city, and perfect for the Narita Express airport train. The hotel itself was fairly easy to find- just look out for the Mr Donut sign at the top of the street. The staff were very approachable, and spoke good English. They had a few print-out maps when I asked about getting to certain locations in the city, and had tips about which metro lines/stations to use. Breakfast was good...a real mixture of options in a buffet style- from fruit/toast to pickled veg and beef curry! The room had a good sized bathroom, with a modern shower. Fully equipped with kettle, fridge, and TV. You can also borrow plug adapters from reception for a small charge. Our room overlooked the Golden Gai which consists of hundreds of 4-5 man bars...well worth a visit- but you wouldn't know without looking outside as the hotel is very quiet and relaxing. On a night there are a few 'touts' on the way to the hotel- but they're easily avoidable, and fine with a ""no thankyou"" response.

Location - Near Shinjuki East, and if you want to buy some things, there is a Muji, a big BIC Camera, Don quijote, shoeps selling pre-owned luxury bags and watches, and a big Uniqlo nearby3. The room - yes it is small but it felt like a 4 star hotel that shrunk. There was a bathtub, quality bottled soap, shampoo and conditioner, complimentary bottled water replenished every day, TV with CNN and Discovery for English channels, and a safe4. Breakfast - we had to leave early twice, and you can exchange the coupon for 500 yen worth of items in Lawson right at the bottom of the hotel5. Staff - Very helpful, good English.others - good strong wifi, I was able to do laundry, and the vendo machines are helpful for a late night beer. A desktop computer with printer was available for guests. they provided an air refreshener spray in the closet, and a shoe horn and brushFor improvement - not much. I havent stayed in a 5 star hotel or any other hotel in Tokyo so I cant compare room sizes. But it was difficult to place big luggage.

If you get off the shinkansen and then local train at Shinjuku and your girlfriend finds the hotel on Google Maps, make sure she's searched for ""Citadines Central Shinjuku"" otherwise you'll have lugged both of your ski gear way further than actually required. There is another Citadines close-by which is not the ""Central"" Citadines. Anyway, once you're at the correct one you'll find it's in a super convenient part of town. Last year we stayed on the western side of the train station near the Government Building but we both much preferred this side of town. For me there were all of the Disk Union stores and for the partner there was tonnes of fashion stores. The other side is the electronics district. The street you find yourself on seems to be home to a lot of ""massage"" parlours. I'm not sure if that should be in inverted commas or not but it didn't seem very legit just judging by the photos. It was fine though, and I think the area is still fine for families as well. Of a night time there were club staff trying to coax people in but they were mostly targeting groups of guys and we were only spoken to once. As for the rooms themselves, they're miniature. We were on the twelfth floor. The first of the floors which needed a swipe card to access so I'm not sure if it's different below that as I think the top few floors were judged, ""business floors"". If you just had carry on it'd be fine but with a ski bag and another 120L bag it was tight as you'll see in the pics. Apart from that the room was really clean. The bed was comfortable and there were two different levels of hardness in the pillows. Nice touch. The bathroom was modern with a shower that had awesome pressure and heated up quickly. What a relief after the ski leg of the trip let me tell you! The shower is really oddly screened in at an angle from the bath. Instead of just having the shower head over the bath, it was weird. I wish we had that floorspace in the main part of the room! Anyway, that was the only complaint so we'd done well. Wifi was also available in room for free so that kept the pressure off the SIM data limits!We only ate at the buffet breakfast twice but it was great. I think it was around 1600 yen per person from memory. It was quite good especially on the mornings we couldn't be bothered finding something nearby. We'd definitely eat there again should we stay there again.Hotel staff were again excellent. All of their staff spoke a fair bit of English to be honest so that really helped. Directions, places to eat, it wasn't a problem at all with these guys and they went out of their way and even booked a popular restaurant for us over the phone.Would we stay here again? Definitely. This is the side of Shinjuku we enjoy the most and Citadines Central is right in the thick of it. A short walk to the train station and the majority of shops we're interested in looking through. It was very clean and the service was excellent.

You sleep there and store your things there. That's the main function of any hotel, yes?The things I like about this hotel is it was very modern and had a sleek Scandinavian feel to it.

And I'm very happy to have found it.This hotel is located in the Kabukicho area near the Shinjuku Station. Many reviewers described this as the ""Red Light District"", suggesting that it may be seedy or unsafe. But neither adjectives would have been correct in describing this hotel.While the Kabukicho area indeed is the heart of the club scene with bright neon lights, big crowds, and non-stop traffic, this hotel is located on a side street off of a major boulevard. And as such, it's actually a relatively quiet street. In addition, if you ask for a high floor room, you cannot hear a thing. It's as quiet as any hotel room.I really like this hotel for its overall value: 1) Price is very reasonable, for under $300 per night for a Delux Double Room on the executive floor (13th) during the week before Christamas. 2) The room is very spacious for two, especially for Tokyo. It's well appointed, with lots of great design details that are simultaneously space saving and elegant. It feels like a room in any high end hotel. 3) An extra bonus is that there is an ""executive common room"" on this floor, with a large confernece table and desk areas for work. I actually held a phone conference there early in the morning, using it just like my own office. This extra room also allowed me to do some work at night or early in the morning without disturbing my family who was sleeping. 4) There are eateries below and surrounding the building. In addition, there is a Lawson's right at the ground floor. You can't ask for a more convenience set up than this!5) It's a straight shoot, 10-minute walk to the SE entrance of the Shinjuku StationThere are only 3 minor reasons for why I didn't give this hotel a 5-star.1) Slow internet: Data maybe ok. But forget about videos. Netflix or YouTube would not load2) Breakfast: The buffet breakfast is very basic. It has both Japanese and Western choices, but very limited. And the menu remains the same day after day. We stayed there for 5 nights, and basically had the same breakfast every day!3) Gym: No gym on site, nor affiliation with any gym for guest use. But overall, we're very happy with this hotel. We will definitely stay there again.","Los Angeles, California","siyuen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",39,4.0

Kabukicho is not your stereotypical area in Japan, there are more foreigners, the streets are littered (which you'd almost never find outside of this district), and there's quite a bit of touting going on despite it being recently illegal in Kabukicho. While these factors may dissuade some people from staying here, I actually prefer it because it's one of the few places where you don't have to adhere to strict Japanese norms because everyone is so free. I can also walk a little further and hang out in another area where all the traditional customs are imposed if I want the regular Japanese experience. I wouldn't necessarily recommend staying in Kabukicho if it's your first time in Japan - because it may give you a wrong impression of what the city is truly like, but after my 5th time in Tokyo, I feel most at home in this area. It's a little silly, but it's very fun. (Tip: Golden Gai is right behind the hotel, which is a really cool place to check out at night)In terms of the hotel itself, I did prefer it slightly more when it was a Best Western because I felt like the toiletries that were provided were a bit better, but overall the quality wasn't really affected by the change. The room is quite small, comfortable for one, but if I had two people carrying two large luggage cases, it would be a challenge to open them both up at the same time. However, the size of the room is something I'm fine comprising as long as the room is clean and affordable. I've stayed at the nearby Hilton before, which was more spacious but much further away from the Shinjuku city centre and much more expensive. I also prefer this Citadines to the other one in Shinjuku because the service I received was much better - I felt like the other Citadines was so overwhelmed with foreigners that the reception often seemed fed up with them.Thanks for a great stay again and I'm sure I'll see you soon.","Toronto, Canada","NinkiCZ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",11,5.0

The hotel is located at the core of the Red District of Shinjuku but is safer than safe (we're in Japan afterall!). We had requested an Executive Double Room Studio and ended up on the 13th floor with a nice view over the Shinjuku skyline (this is not the Cerulean though...). The room was advertised as being around 25 m/s but I HIGHLY doubt this is accurate, it felt way tinier than that and the bed is the smallest queen size bed I've ever seen in my life in terms of width (which for 190 euros / night in a TOP floor executive room was rather surprising I must say even by Tokyo standards). The bathroom was clean and functional with all the necessary amenities. The staff is extremely helpful and speaks decent English.

The bedroom layout was fine - although the room was quite small, the hotel managed to make it feel spacious; and with the usual safe/fridge/amenities, it had everything you might need for a short stay.

Don't get me wrong, it was very well decorated, with sporadic wifi and all the usual amenities in the bathroom, tea and coffee with kettle in room. We were just a little disappointed with the room size, the smallest double bed I've encountered in some while if I'm honest. But, it's a reasonable price and very clean, and you're right in the middle of a fairly lively area with plenty of bars and restaurants just moments away. Being a smoker, I had to pop down to the ground floor to have a quick smoke outside but that wasn't too much of a crisis, though I did come to realise that the hotel itself is positioned on a street where no one ever seems to sleep, no matter what time of day, night or morning (sometimes 3 or 4am) there was always crowds of people outside.

We also really liked the price - very reasonable.My tip here: Try the restaurant on the second floor called Udon Dining Sururi - large menu and fun dining if you want to try something like shabu shabu. And maybe ask for a room on one of the executive floors (13 and up). I see several reviews regarding room size but was very pleased with ours and maybe that's because we were on one of the exec floors.

It wasn’t an exquisite experience but the location makes up for the compromises.After checking in, we were surprised to find that the adjoining room we requested for our children did not exist at all in the hotel—at least not in the configurations we had opted for. We were instead offered rooms across the hall from each other, and we took it. The staff spoke English very well and we sorted things out. Our room was very small but clean. Basically it was queen-sized bed (maybe smaller) with a little wiggle room to the mini desk / dresser combo. One corner of the bed was within 12 inches of the desk with1 sides of the bed and the headboard along adjacent walls. There was tiny little “couch” with two throw pillows. Add two suitcases into the room and it was very hard for the wife and I to move around the room without getting on each other’s nerves.The bed was a queen, although I suspect it was very undersized—just like the tiny pillows. I had to sleep on the side touching the wall, so a good night’s rest was eluded me most of our 5 nights.Our room had one window which could not be opened to freshen up the air in the room. The air-conditioning control is in Japanese, so we had to figure it out by trial and error. It can easily take more than one night to get the hang of but thanks to having two of them (kids’ room and ours) to experiment with, we figured it out in by the second or third night.The bathroom was very clean. The tub is extra deep with a shower head adjustable to a comfortable height for people over 6 feet in height. Like the room, the bathroom was very tight. The door doesn’t open to even 90 degrees and don’t even think about getting dressed in there. Definitely, a one person at a time kind of bathroom. I was seriously worried that door would swing open while I was shaving and made a conscious effort to keep a defensive elbow at the ready.The room safe is in the nightstand drawer and not bolted down to anything. A thief can simply take the whole safe, put it under a jacket and work on it when they get home. Definitely not good. That said, we never felt that any of our stuff would be at any risk.The TV had all of 3 English channels that I could find. CNN, an NHK English channel and Discovery.Breakfast was very tasty however, it’s the same thing every day, except for the alternating main proteins of either chicken nuggets (Kara Age, actually) or stir fry beef.The huge upside is the location that couldn’t be any better. The hotel is in the heart of Shinjuku, with restaurants, bars and shops seemingly all night. We were at one shop well past midnight. None of our ladies was ever harassed, despite warnings that the male crowd can get rowdy. Even very crowded places were comparatively quiet. The hotel is also a short walk to the train station that gets you everywhere in Tokyo. To sum up, we are definitely looking forward to staying here again. The cramped space and tiny pillows are a small price to pay be in the heart of probably the most vibrant city on the planet. Don’t worry about sleeping, you won’t want to anyway. But if you do crash, the place may be cramped but it sure is clean and queit.","Manila, Philippines","James M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",36,3.0

Small sized but that's normal in Japan. * Location is good, an easy 10-minute walk with a 4yo kid to Shinjuku station. Lots of dining options around the station.* There's a convenience store downstairs and a nearby pharmacy. Poor:* The studio deluxe twin room is old and slightly musty though housekeeping did their best to ensure cleanliness. There was a portable aircon inside that we used from time to time to cool down the room. * Wifi was pretty bad. We resorted to using our own portable wifi the whole time. * Prepare for some long waits at the laundry machines. It must be terrible for the adjacent room/s to hear the machines going on and on until midnight. The hotel should increase the number of machines and choose a better location.Outside the hotel's jurisdiction, my husband was a victim of drink spiking on our first night. The next morning, he had sms and calls from the bank confirming $2000+ card charges & withdrawal! He was totally blank on which pub it was and what actually happened.

There's a lot of positives that make this place deserve a higher rating than the three stars I gave but a couple things could be improved.Let's start with the positive. The check-in and front desk employees are extremely nice. The rooms are clean and quiet. Two bottles of water are provided each day as long as the bottles are being used. The shower and bathroom are in good condition. The location is about 8 minutes to Shinjuku station which is the main hub in Tokyo. The Food: The breakfast included was decent. Each day at the breakfast buffet there is different juices available, salad, toast and other types of bread, eggs, either beef or fried chicken nuggets, Japanese miso and curry, rice, and fruit. FYI, the coffee was terrible at breakfast. The negatives are that the free wifi they provide barely works. It's so frustrating that I would go to Lawson's store next door to use the free wifi. The staff wasn't always totally knowledgeable about everything but that is understandable I guess. My wife didn't like the bed but I thought it was fine.

On my trip to Japan, I stayed there for the beginning and the end of the trip. There are a lot of choices of hotels in Tokyo in all price ranges. Citadines Central Shinjuku definitely falls into the mid value but high quality class.Finding anything in Tokyo is nearly always an ordeal. While Citadines Central Shinjuku is only 10 minutes away from JR Shinjuku Station, it is down a smaller street and isn't visible from outside the station. The website is fairly good in describing how to get to the hotel. For me, I found the easiest way was to just go to the East exit from Shinjuku Station, look for the BIC electronic store and start walking down the street. Cross the first street and you should see ABC Mart on your right. Keep walking in a straight line away from BIC until you get to the next big street. You should see a Burger King and a 7-Eleven across the right. Turn right until you get to the first crosswalk. You should see a Mr. Donut across from you. Cross the street and continue walking. You should see the hotel on your right. Once you know where the hotel is, you will find lots of different ways to get to and from the hotel every day.The hotel lobby is on the 3rd floor and there is an elevator to the side. The lobby is smallish but large enough to have a restaurant on the side. Check-in for me was very fast and smooth. They had a stack of face towels, wash clothes, shavers, etc at the check-in counter that you can take. The room itself was about the expected size for a room in Tokyo. We had 3 luggage that we ended up stacking on top of each other so that we can have some room to walk around. Everything looked new and clean. Every room has a electric kettle and all of the amenities. In addition, they provided 2 complimentary bottles of water every day. That was certainly a pleasant touch. Internet is also complimentary but I think it was probably the worst of all the hotels I stayed in on this trip. It frequently stop working during the evening. I think they just had too many guests using it and not enough bandwidth.We had breakfast at the hotel as it was part of our package. It is a nice little spread but gets old after a day or two since they don't really change the variety. The food was good but you can find better just outside the hotel. I also did laundry at the hotel. They had 2 washers and dryers. Washers were 300 Yen but includes the detergent while dryers were 100 Yen for 30 minutes. If you are washing heavy items like jeans, you will probably need more than 30 minutes from those dryers.The staff at the hotel was friendly and helpful. They even recognize me when I returned for the second stay. One service that they include is luggage storage. My trip included a 7 day trip down to the southern part of Japan. They were happy to hold on to my unneeded luggage until I returned at no extra charge. That was also very helpful as luggage storage can be quite expensive in Tokyo.Overall, I really enjoyed staying at the Citadines Central Shinjuku and would recommend it for most people unless you need solid internet. I think that the area is busy and can get really crowded but the hotel itself is unaffected. There must be a million things to do in Shinjuku and you can't go wrong using Citadines Central Shinjuku as your base!",San Diego,"SANsna</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",123,4.0

Sometime it is hard to find hotels that accept three people in other countries. The room is small, but not tiny compared to other major cities. Having the sofa bed out as a bed of course eats up space. The bathroom is tiny, with a Japanese soaking tub with shower. The tub is not as long as a western tub, but taller for soaking. There is a Toto toilet with a bidet washlet function, which is very common throughout Tokyo. The sink is outside the bathroom, with hardly any counter space. But there is a medicine cabinet. The room only has one tiny trash can, and one medium trash can. We would bag up food containers and put them outside our door. The kitchen is tiny, but functional with a sink, a small counter, a microwave and utensils and plates. Storage space is reasonable except for luggage. Seating space is limited with the sofa bed setup as a bed. Rooms facing the main street do get some road noise. We had a non-smoking room with no hint of cigarette smell. The main bed is comfortable; the box spring is directly on the floor, so the bed height is short. The location is east of Shinjuku station, in a relatively quiet section of town. Compared to areas near Shinjuku station, the area is a haven. If you wanted more activity, Shinjuku station is a short metro ride away, or a long walk. So if you want a restful and peaceful place to stay, the Citidines Shinjuku is highly recommended.The metro is a short walk from the hotel. The street to the metro is a alley like street with limited vehicle traffic with a steady stream of people walking by. Compared to the Shinjuku station area, it was much more peaceful. There are lots of places to eat along the route. We did not have a bad meal during our stay. There is a 7-11 on the corner of the hotel with a decent selection of prepared food. The ATM also works with U.S. ATM cards. At the 7-11, make a left down the street to the metro. Near the end is a Family Mart store with a better selection of prepared food. The prepared food is much better than in U.S. convenience stores. Across the street from the hotel to the left is a bento box store. There is a buffet style selection of food, you select what you want and put it into take out plastic containers. You pay by the weight. The food quality of course is better than the convenience store. The location of this Citidines is great because it is near a small metro station. From this station you can get to anywhere. Shinjuku station and Shibuya station are massive and takes time to navigate through them. I would avoid them just because they are such a headache to get through; there are just massive amounts of people going in all directions. They are also not well air conditioned because of the energy crisis in Japan. The Shinjuku gyoemmae station by contrast is tiny and not that crowded with people getting on during the times we used it. It is also not that hot. In the morning there is a wall of people coming out of the station, but few people going in it. In the gyoemmae station, it is short walk to either platform. In the big metro/train stations, it is a major hike to find your platform. We took a taxi to Tokyo station for the Shinkansen, The staff went outside to hail a taxi for us, and told the driver where we wanted to go. We took a taxi to a avoid lugged our luggage through Shinjuku station and then to Tokyo station. The taxi was 2,800 yen, and it is worth it to avoid dragging our luggage up and down stairs. Tokyo train stations are not designed for ease of mobility. Highly recommended.","Orange, California","patagoniac57</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange, California</strong>",57,5.0

Some noted restaurants require reservations on the first day of the month before, so their phone lines are usually busy then. I had emailed the hotel to do the reservations for me. They had been persistent enough to keep calling the restaurants for several days. They were able to get me a reservation in only one famous restaurant, but I truly appreciate the effort even in just trying to contact the others.

Plus, it is a 10 minute walk to the major Shinjuku station and about an 8 minute walk to a smaller station which will get you on the convenient Marunouchi line (getting you anywhere you want). The staff was great. When I first booked, all they had was smoking rooms. I asked the front desk very nicely if he could please find me a non-smoking room and he found one. I was so relieved and happy. The staff is incredibly knowledgeable about the area and have several maps to help you. Also, they have all kinds of power adapters if you forgot one. I will be honest and say this is sort of in the red light district - however if you aren't looking for that type of thing, you can just walk by the places and not really know about it. The free wifi is very reliable and as fast as you need.My wife and I were thrilled that this place was right behind the Golden Gai area -- alleyways of cool, unique, tiny, special bars. It was so fun to explore at night (still safe). It is also right by the Hanazono Shrine which is beautiful to walk to at night.The breakfast was fine. A ""western"" breakfast although Westerners may find the food just slightly different than we are used to. We got the breakfast included which for us, was very convenient. Go a little early and do your day planning at the table, it fills up quickly. The room we got was a Standard Semi-Double Room and it had more room than other hotels we had visited in Japan.

You can then easily use other lifts adjacent to access all other floors. We know that other Citadines facilities require key card access the other floors.

The hotel itself is very clean and smart. The room was very much on the small side but it was sufficient and we didn't plan to spend that much time in the room anyway. The location is excellent and shinjinku is definitely a great location in Tokyo. I had read the hotel was in the red light district and worried but my husband and I joked that we didn't in fact notice this for the first few days. It is fair to say that only on one day towards the end of our stay I was walking behind my husband and a man approached him and asked if he would like help getting hooked up but when my husband said he was with his wife the man apologised profusely and left. A few streets down is the real red light district, but again we perhaps naively didn't at first realise this. My husband described it as the pink techno light district!The breakfast in the hotel is good as well - it provides a hot breakfast which is nice but some dishes are perhaps a bit random for an English person (it includes a beef curry) but they do also do scrambled egg, omelette and sausage as well though don't expect a full English. They also have cereal and croissants. There is plenty to eat. There are loads of good restaurants around the hotel and just a few steps down the road is a British pub that does brilliant drinks and has a great atmosphere in the evening. We went in there most nights. There is also a shop right underneath the hotel which is brilliant and I highly recommend it - it's 24 hours and it sells drinks and also hot food as well as cosmetics and umbrellas! Getting to shinjinku station and getting your bearings can be difficult for the first few days. I recommend leaving a 'building breadcrumb', I.e. Trying to remember buildings as landmarks. It is difficult to spot or see road signs, and in fact I can't remember actually seeing one at all. Mister donut is at the end of the road for the hotel and we always used this to find it. Also the east exit from Shinjinku station is the best to get to the hotel. Again, the hotel provides lots of maps in English showing you walking routes and station exits and the staff - who speak good English - are exceptionally helpful. I highly recommend using the subway to get around and buying a suica (their oyster equivalent) card. The suica can also be used in Kyoto subway and you pay 2000 yen for it with 500 yen refund when you return the card (1500 yen credit) - so don't throw it away! Shinjinku has a number of subway and JR lines going through it but the signposts are also in English. Also the stations now have a letter for the line and then a number for each station - this helps you to decipher which direction you need to go in. We used the subway quite easily.I really do recommend this hotel if you're staying in Tokyo both for location and price. Shinjinku is a great area, and this hotel will allow you to discover it. There are other hotels on the western side which are by the government buildings, but that area is quiet at night and when we visited, it felt a bit far away from the action of East Shinjinku. The last thing is we took a taxi to Tokyo station when we left which cost 3000 yen (about £15). This might seem steep but we couldn't face pulling our suitcases through Shinjinku station which is very busy. ",,Nata959,32,4.0

It was the second stop on our Japan adventure and we felt right at home. It's in a perfect location, with everything one could possibly need in walking distance, red light district and Izakaya included. The room was spacious enough given how notoriously small Tokyo hotel rooms are. It was clean, comfortable and all we needed, and the bathroom facilities exceeded my expectations. It was very hot inside the room as it was winter and the heating was pumping too high with the a/c doing very little to cool to room down (my only gripe). The breakfast is substantial and contains everything one needs to start their day. Reception staff were approachable and helpful when needed. It's also handy having the lawson store directly below.The directions on the hotel website are very vague, so here are the ones I used when I was there... When you exit the station (east exit) you will see the mizuho bank to your right (across the road), so walk down the alley way to the left of that landmark and head to the next main street, which is Kabukicho. Cross the pedestrian crossing and turn right down Kabukicho. Walk one or two blocks (depending on what alley you turned down), and on the corner a few blocks up you'll see mister donut on the left hand side... this is your street. Turn left and the hotel will be located above a lawson store on the 3rd floor some 300m down. I hope this helps. It's really that simple, and you'll find it no problem the second time. Trust me. I am very happy with this property and will stay here again when I get the opportunity to be in Tokyo once more.

The hotel website has a handy map you can download from its website that gives you directions. It is REALLY easy. Took just a few minutes even pulling a trolley case.The hotel staff were excellent. Check-in was fast and efficient and they had noted my advance request for an early check-in and had the room ready over 2hrs before their normal time. That was really good as I was super tired and just needed to rest.Rooms are small by European standards but average for Japan. If there are two of you I think you'd have to be pretty organised with your luggage and quite neat in order to avoid it feeling cramped. Clean and modern though. They offer you an 'opt out' from daily cleaning as a way of saving the planet... if you agree to it and don't have your room serviced for two days they will give you 500JPY gift voucher. It is not as easy as it sounds so check the conditions!Location is great, Shinjuku Golden Gai literally behind the hotel, easy walking to shops and subways and the breakfasts are pretty good too, plenty and a nice variety. Often my breakfast lasted me until mid-afternoon when I had a 'coffee and cake' break meaning two proper meals a day and a snack... so I save a little bit on expensive meals out.There is a 24hr convenience store downstairs if you need extra snacks, beer or pretty much anything at any time. They speak a few words of English too which was helpful. There is a 7 Eleven a bit further down the street with an ATM/cash machine that works with non-Japanese cards (many only work with Japanese cards), so that was really useful.There is free wifi in the room BUT oh lord... it is slow!!

The hotel was in a great location- so close to Shinjuku Station and tons of bars, restaurants and shopping. There are a lot of hostess clubs around the hotel, but I felt quite safe even late at night. There is a Lawson right downstairs and a Seven-Eleven about 2 doors up the street. We stayed here for 9 nights with breakfast included. The buffet breakfast got a bit boring since they only change up one or two dishes, but it's decent enough. The room we had was on the 11th floor, with a nice view (on the Golden Gai side) and I didn't find it to be particularly small, I thought it was a good size for two of us, however, I'm used to New York apts, so it's subjective. The bathroom was nice with a tub and semi-separate shower. I was glad they had a small laundry facility, I used it twice during the stay, FYI the detergent is dispensed in the wash automatically. The hotel was clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. I know this Best Western was bought out by Citadines, so not sure what will change, but I would definitely stay here again.","New York City, New York","Jenyc_native</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",5,4.0

Make sure you know how to get to the hotel before arriving at Shinjuku station. This area can be pretty daunting to navigate first time around. It is a 5 minute walk once you know where you're going.The hotel rooms are small but, as I understand, average for Tokyo, and typically Japanese clean. Don't do breakfast in the hotel, not good. Rather go out and find something better for less $$. This is the only reason for a 4 rather than 5 rating.Yes, the hotel is in the red light district, but if you weren't told that, you wouldn't know. We felt very safe, even at night. The immediate area buzzes 24/7 and has a multitude of restaurants and bars, not to mention other weird and wonderful attractions. Make sure to visit the warren of alleyways behind the hotel that is the Golden Gai. Fascinating! The Lawson's convenience store under the hotel is very useful.Staff were very friendly and helpful. One tip - If you're catching the bullet train out of Tokyo to Kyoto/Osaka etc, give yourself more time than you think necessary to get to Tokyo Station (possibly go to Shinagawa rather, the bullet train stops here).If you don't mind walking, I would suggest a walk from Shinjuku to Shibuya via Yoyogi park in Harajuku. Another cool and free attraction was the view from the Metro Government building in West Shinjuku. On a clear day you can see Mt Fuji.","Perth, Australia","Macowl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",51,4.0

We stayed on the 11th floor where we had access to the executive lounge on the 13th floor, it was nice to enjoy free hot drinks and views that were different from our hotel room. one great perk of staying here was that all toiletries were provided and restocked daily, it was something less that we had to worry about while traveling.

I hope their service quality and offering remains.Firstly, the location of this hotel is amazing: it is walking distance to Shinjuku JR station as well as the subway lines. Secondly, if you get a twin room, the bathroom contains a large bath tub: you don't have to go to an onset. Thirdly, they put out a complimentary brekkie which is generous.How to get there?Your hotel is one of the first rises on the street heading into Kabuki-cho with Mr Donut as your landmark. If you are coming from Shinjuku station, it is pretty easy to get lost manoeuvring/walking to the hotel. So, print a map, hop on a cab and it will cost you Y1000 to get you from Shinjuku station to the hotel. Very short ride but will save sanity and marriages. Once you have oriented yourself, you will realise how close everything is but so easy to get lost. The best exit for BW is the Shinjuku East station exit. If you get lost on the tunnels of subway: come out immediately. Staying underground makes it more disorienting.Tip 2: get a high floor so you get to see all the twinkle lights.Tip 3: the executive lounge is where you can sit and read the paper/ipad in peace. There is a machine which dispenses extremely sweet coffee and tea.Tip 4: make your own tea and coffee before heading to lounge.Tip 5: the hotel produces their own Shinjuku local map and a train map. Take a couple. I have saved a lot of lost people using these maps. No other hotels produce such a comprehensive map.Tip 6: if you are non-Japanese, you will not get hustled by the local pimps (did i say pimps? yes but they are respectful of you). You will, however, get hustled by black hustlers who are aggressive and rude. Think hustlers at the base of Eiffel Tower and you will get my drift. The local hustlers get into conflict from time to time with these foreign hustlers. So, what to do? Head down and don't make eye contact.Lawson is your local 24 hour supermarket. At the escalators of the hotel, if you turn right and walk down the street and take the first left, there is a supermarket which stocks gazillions brands of whiskey, sake,wine and cheese. This fave ""tuck"" shop of mine is about 10 mins away. There is no duty so stock up as much as you want. This brings me to Tip 5: bring bubble wrap so you can go home with exquisite sake tucked into your luggage.Tip 6: You have run out of money. Where do you go for currency exchange? Head towards Shinjuku JR station. There is a cake place called Ducky Duck. Ducky Duck is opposite Citibank. You can change your money there but the rates are awful.When you see Ducky Duck, walk to wards ABC Mart and you will see a decorative rock in the middle of the road. Take a right and you will see Mizuho Bank and SMBC bank. Both have better currency exchange,Tip 7: There are these crazy Matsumoto drug stores which are always always full. If you bring your passport, you will get 8% off.Tip 8: Uniqlo in Tokyo is very different from all the shops globally, They sell everything..i mean everything. Again bring passport to get tax free.Even though BW is in the middle of a red light district, as a woman, i never felt hassled and always felt safe. Of course, be vigilant. The hotel is quiet too. And if you want extra privacy, there is a ladies floor only.","Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","Yappas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</strong>",145,5.0

We stayed in a Executive Twin A room and there are 2 semi-double bed pushed together. Great for family use though walking space is tight. Room is clean and fairly new.

The superior room (on the 13th floor) was a decent size, very good bathroom and shower but the bed was on the very firm side and the pillows extremely firm (a couple of cheap feather pillows from a local dept store helped).

However, once I checked into the room, I was impressed by how immaculate and contemporary the room was! While not the largest of rooms, it's still bigger than your average Tokyo hotel room, and it was very accommodating to say the least. The staff were helpful and responsive when I kept pestering them with emails about my laptop accessories that I had absentmindedly left in the room after checkout, no English barriers whatsoever. The included breakfast buffet was meh, nothing special to write home about, and I could have sworn their scrambled eggs had enough oil in them to power ten vehicles, but you could easily reach for other breakfast proteins. The only knock on the hotel (and this isn't even the hotel's fault) is that it's situated in a slightly seedier neighborhood. Every night, I had these Cameroonian guys approach me, pretending to by my friend and wanting to introduce me to ladies at a club.

Take the Yamanote line to Nippori and catch the Keisei limited express( platform 2) to Narita. The total travel time is approximately 2 hours. Try to avoid rush hours if you have too much luggage.

There are no lifts to the ground level at the East exit so you will need to carry your bags up the flight of stairs.

I am very sensitive to the noise and you can hear the noise in the rooms too. We were on the 9th floor. The hotel itself was clean and the staff very friendly and warm.

From Shinjuku station take a Central East or East exit to Kabukicho.2. From outside JR Station look for big MIZUHO billboard sign at the top of building on your left and ABC Mart on your right.If you take the right exit, Mizuho sign cannot be missed.3.

It is conveniently located, around 5-10 minute walk from Shinjuku Station. It's also less than 5 minutes from the Shinjuku Sanchome underground exit E1, near the Hanazono Shrine.The easiest way to find it when you land at Shinjuku Station is to take the South East Exit (near ""Gap""), walk across the street and down the road with ""Green Peas"" to your left. At the traffic lights, keep going 'straight' (it's a little dog-leg zig across the road) - there will be a Kinokuniya to the right and a Suit Factory to your left. At the next lights, cross diagonally towards Mister Donut. Pop down the paved alley (pedestrian traffic only) and when you see a convenience store concourse area on your left, this is where you catch the lift to the third floor for reception. It's tricky to find the first time, but very convenient once you know the way.The hotel is on the very edge of Kabuki-cho, convenient if you want to visit the 'red-light' district, and on the edge enough if you'd rather avoid it. During the day, you are no more than a 5-10 minute walk from tonnes of great shopping such as Isetan, Marui Department stores and Muji, Kinokuniya and more.The hotel itself has a really welcoming atmosphere, especially for a business hotel. The staff always go above and beyond, even calling the City Office to help me organise my wedding! Nothing is too much trouble for them, from storing luggage, to helping with travel plans, to dealing with my multiple bookings for 9 people on various visits over 1 month (November 2014). Even though the Japanese are known for their service, the staff here exceed expectations with their genuine and kind manner.The rooms are small, but comfortable. Housekeeping is excellent, the rooms are always fresh and clean, with complimentary bottled water supplied each day, along with nice cosmetics, shower supplies and other toiletries. We love the new oil cleanser packs! The bed is comfortable, with a double-sided pillow so that you can choose between 'Western' style or a more textured Japanese style pillow. The bathroom is excellent, not a pre-fab room, but an actual, real, tiled bathroom.Breakfast was included with our room, with a great selection of fresh items for both Western and Japanese tastes. Even though November is extremely busy in Tokyo, we never had to wait for the buffet. I love the Best Western and would not hesitate staying here every time I'm in Tokyo.

Laundry facility at level 7 of the hotel was a plus point (no need to purchase washing powder as it gets dispensed once you put in the right amount of change into coin slot; and there's a dryer as well).The walk to Shinjuku station was a lot further than expected.

One thing I would add regarding the location: even though it's only 10 minutes from Shinjuku Station, it is NOT an easy walk when you've traveled for 30 hours and are carrying your luggage. We only travel with one carry-on roller each, and dragging them through the packed streets of Shinjuku at night turned out to be a very bad idea. Get a cab from the station when you arrive.The rooms are very clean and well-designed, but small enough that one side of the bed was flat against the wall and there was only one side table. Even for tall folks though, the bed was pretty comfortable. At least there's no footboard, so my 6'7"" husband could let his legs dangle off the end. The bathroom was actually a nice size, considering the size of the room, and the tub was deep enough that I could use it comfortably (I'm 5'10""). The hotel provides two bottles of water (free) daily, which I always appreciate, and there's an electric kettle in the room with tea and coffee bags (although my mom, who had a single room across the hall, did not have a coffee setup in her room). Ask the front desk for restaurant recommendations. They gave us a very good map with several different types of restaurants within walking distance marked in English. One soba place in particular, Daian, was really special (see my separate review of it if you're interested). The udon restaurant downstairs is also very good, especially on the first night when you're travel-weary and hungry.One very special touch: we happened to stay here for Culture Day (Nov. 3), which is a national holiday honoring the traditional Japanese culture and promoting the love of freedom and peace. When we returned to our rooms after an amazing day at Senso-ji Temple, we found two origami cranes which the staff had made and left as a gift. One is now sitting in my office and the other is in my husband's. What a lovely gesture. I highly recommend this hotel - the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was the size of the room, which started to close in on us after 3 nights.","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","NicoleLovesVeggies</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>",72,4.0

We stayed here for 5 nights in October and will be back to stay here again. We were given a room on the 11th floor which is non smoking (thank god)! Rooms were average size for Japan so knew to expect a small room but we didn't feel that the room was too small for us. The bathrooms are modern and an excellent size with walk in shower and the beds were very comfy! Breakfast was excellent with a mixture of western and asian cuisine. Breakfast area was a bit small so at peak times you could be waiting a while. Location of the hotel was excellent, felt like were amongst everything. Restaurants, bars, shopping!

When I heard I was staying at a Best Western I thought - ""Ok, Best Western, it'll be clean and comfortable, nothing exciting"" - this place is awesome!! It is well located in Shinjuku, an easy 10 minute walk from the station. The reception area is warm and peaceful and the staff are very pleasant and welcoming. They charge you your bill for your stay when you check in, so you only have to worry about any thing extra you buy at the hotel. Breakfast was included in our room rate , and we were given the credit in the form of vouchers which you present to the staff at breakfast time, The rooms are immaculate and comfortable! You can sort of hear the noise outside but not enough to keep you awake all night, and the blinds do very well at keeping the room nice and dark for a good peaceful sleep. The bathroom was a good size, complete with a combined shower and bath, and the shower had great pressure and temperature!! I also loved how the hotel provided almost every toiletry you could possibly need - complimentary - even though there us a 24 hour convenience store in the same building :-P The breakfast buffet was wonderful, offering a wide array of cuisine - western style breakfast: cereals, fruit, yoghurt, toast, croissants, eggs, sausages etc -- and also the more traditional offerings in a Japanese breakfast. It was very high quality fresh food!! The hotel is really well located -- with a 24 hour Lawson convenience store right downstairs if you need anything, and the whole area of Shinjuku is buzzing with great restaurants and shops!!

The parks are amazing, plentiful and close. It is very close to the Shinjuku station to catch a train to where every you need to go.The good: The only memories I have of a Best Western was staying at motels during car trips as a kid. But the reviews were great and decided to take a chance. It was worth the savings over the Hilton and Hyatt which were only a few blocks away. The rooms were very small but comfortable. Service was great and we had free breakfast every morning which was a plus. If you don't have that as part of your hotel stay, just wonder down the street to Dunkin Donuts for a quick cup of coffee and donuts :o) The bad: Ask for a high floor. There is a lot of street noise from midnight to 3pm. Also, the staff didn't have very good insight for western visitors. We asked for dining recommendations and we received very little input. We ventured to the Hyatt to talk with their concierge. We got great tips where to eat and were told to always venture into the basements of the large office buildings. It was an amazing tip. Each building has several shops and dining options. The food was very reasonably priced, authentic and they always had ""happy hour"" specials. Do not dine at the Hyatt or Hilton. We looked at the prices and a burger was $50 USD! The ugly: I knew this place was too good to be true. During the day, it appears to be part of the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. But after 10 pm, the street transforms to a redlight district. They have many ""gentlemen's"" clubs where many drag men were soliciting for patrons to join them in the club.",,coloradotrigirl,198,4.0

Love its easy access to almost everything that a traveler would need...Shinjuku train station, a huge variety of restaurants and shopping malls such as Isetan,Takashimaya,Muji to name a few and many more. Though it's location is just minutes away from the heart of the red light district, we felt very safe and no unpleasant experience at all. I traveled with my husband and our two teenage boys.Room - was kind of small by our standard but because we are in Tokyo, the size is acceptable. Toilet was neat and clean. Free two bottled water are provided and replenished everyday and so as the basic personal hygiene kit.Staff - can speak English, courteous, helpful and so accommodating. Our request for a higher floor was granted and my sincerest thank you to Aya, Satomi, all the front office and Stella staff and of course the housekeeping for always making our room clean and tidy to rest after a long day of exploring Tokyo. My son deeply appreciates the welcome chocolate with birthday greeting card and so as the birthday cake for bringing it up to his room was such the sweetest gesture. You guys rock!Stella has a widespread of hearty breakfast to kick start the day. Can't complain about the food choices for they have what we usually eat in the morning:coffee, tea, bread, milk, cereals, rice, egg, fresh fruits, yogurt, vegetable salad and many more.On our first day, we had walk from the hotel to the National Gyoen Garden. The garden is huge and so beautiful. You'll need at least a day to see everything in there.The Fee is 200 JPY. Hanazono Jinja Shrine is about 3 minutes walk from the hotel. The following day we took a cab from the hotel to Kagurazaka and paid 1,350 JPY where we had our lunch. Kagurazaka is a good place to relax and enjoy good food. It has traditional Japanese small shops with plenty of restaurants tucked away along the side streets. We had the best lunch and bought good quality of different types of tea and a teapot to go along. I wish we have stayed the whole day.Overall, we had a marvelous Tokyo holiday, enjoyed our day trip to Hakone, an interesting star wars ride in Tokyo Disneyland, gastronomic feast in Kagurazaka and saw the magnificent Tokyo Sky Tree and was able to do some shopping on the side along the way.Best Western Shinjuku Astina Hotel Tokyo will always be our number one hotel choice whenever we are in Tokyo!","Singapore, Singapore","MunjiPanuncio</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",7,4.0

Reservation ProcessWe booked through Hotels.com. I found choosing a room quite confusing but this was not the hotels fault, I wish I had booked with them directly as their website was clear and had the best rates. 2. ArrivalI had put in a request for early check-in because I knew we would be arriving at the hotel at around 10am as we flew all night. When we arrived unfortunately my request couldn't be accommodated. We were however upgraded which was a nice touch. The reception staff spoke great english (maybe not as great as other countries but you'll soon learn that barely anyone in Japan speaks english so they do a great job). In terms of finding the hotel, we had no trouble! We took the east exit and followed the sign to Kabukicho and then looked for the Mister Donut and there it was. About a 5minute walk and as our weeks stay went on we found more and more shortcuts to get there quicker. 3. The roomExtremely small! We stayed in a 'Double Room'. We had low expectations however because I chose the hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews we knew how small the room was going to be. In saying this however the room had everything we needed - a comfy bed, good shower and toilet. We also had quite a nice view over Tokyo too! I found the room to be quite well set out for the space there is to work with. My only complaints would be firstly, that we couldn't get our air conditioner to work and the room got quite stuffy but the directions were in Japanese so we just left it - if we had really wanted I'm sure if we called staff they would have helped but it didn't phase us too much, and secondly, that the pillows were HORRIBLE. I ended up sleeping on my clothes some of the time because my neck got so incredibly sore. Shower water pressure was great. I must also comment that the rooms were EXTREMELY clean which I think is a determinative factor in my overall impression of accommodation. 4. BreakfastOk so this I would say would be the major downfall of the hotel. We only had breakfast at the hotel 3 times as we just couldn't stand it. If you are happy with REALLY basic food it's fine, but we got over potato wedges and onion rings. There were barely any fresh fruit options either. We tried 'Bills' in Harajuku one day - amazzzzzing! You must try the hotcakes - see seperate review! 5. LocationThis was the best part of the hotel. It was close to everything! We weren't concerned with spending our holiday in the hotel room, we just wanted a good base, and it didn't disappoint. With Lawsons downstairs, Shinjuku shopping just minutes away and the JR station only 5 minutes walk, it was PERFECT! If I have any tips for you if it's your first time to Tokyo - bring your walking shoes! We left the hotel room in the morning and by the time we returned in the arvo we had walked about 13km each day. In terms of being in the red light district - I am quite young and I never had any trouble. Some of the nigerians approached my partner one night however we just kept walking and they didn't bother us again. Definitely nothing to worry about at all and I am very safety conscious. 6. One extra pointOne night we were woken by a fire alarm at 3am. It was actually quite stressful as the alarm was only in Japanese so we didn't know what it meant. It was only another couple who could translate across the hall who alerted us to the fire. We walked down the 12 levels only to find no staff at the bottom of the building at 3am. We went back to reception to find lots of other guests standing around not knowing what to do. The reception staff were quite casual about the situation, saying it was a mistake and we could go back to bed. I'm not sure whether anyone actually checked that it was a mistake as it seemed no one really knew what was going on. Lucky for us there was no fire but I would be worried in the future should the same thing happen as not all guests knew what to do and half of the people didn't even evacuate. We received a letter of apology the next day but that was it - I found this quite strange!OVERALL:I would stay here again. It was basic, but it was also much cheaper than other options in Tokyo, and I wouldn't waste my money staying somewhere which I considered just to be a base for exploring. Yes there are things that could be improved but it was fine for me.","Melbourne, Australia","Emily D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",20,4.0

The area immediately around the hotel is a little seedy, even though the city government offices are nearly across the street. Just walk a block south and the area improves a lot. It is completely safe, however, and there are lots of tourists and other people around, so nothing to fear. The hotel itself is good, starting on the 3rd floor of the building and going up to the 14th floor. The top 2 floors are ""executive"" floors, and the next 2 down are designated for ""business"". I don't know if the rooms are any different, but you do need a card key to access these floors and not the others. My room faced the rear of the building and was quiet. I never heard my neighbors, although I think I might have just been lucky. The breakfast buffet is the standard fare with hot and cold offerings (was included with my rate). The biggest find: two washing machines and two dryers on the 7th floor. 300 yen to wash, 200 to dry (laundry detergent automatically added to the wash). This was a really nice feature of the hotel. The internet access is barely acceptable. Wi-Fi signal strength is high, but the bandwidth is very limited. My SlingBox was brought to it's knees, and downloading email attachments was slow. The TV has no English channels, so lack of good internet access makes watching internet TV impossible. The hotel needs to do something about this. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. As for Shinjuku area, there is a really cool area of small alleyways with little bars tucked in due East of Shinjuku station, but overall I didn't love it.

On the other hand, seeing hyper-urban Tokyo was cool, though I would probably prefer to stay in a more peaceful area like Ueno next time. A couple of notes - the famous ""Golden Gai"" bar area is right behind the hotel, and if you are a man, actively avoid the African men outside of the hotel - they will aggressively push you, even grab you, to go the bars they are promoting.

Nice decor and layout in the rooms, although (with a lot of rooms in Tokyo anyway) very small - much smaller than what I was expecting! The bathroom was clean and well set-out (actually bigger than the bedroom section!), with electronic toilets! What I was impressed about was the bathroom dispensers for shampoo, shower gel etc. They come in large containers, rather than the small, one-off containers that you would normally get elsewhere. This method saves both resources, and doesn't pressurise you into using small amounts unnecessarily.The staff also provided a miniature toiletry set for my son which I thought was both novel and considerate.In terms of location the hotel is a bit difficult to find, although it is no more than 10 minutes from Shinjuku Metro station or the bus terminals that link Tokyo to other parts of the country.We travelled directly here after landing at Haneda Airport, and it took ages by bus due to the traffic!The area is Tokyo's version of a red-light district though judging by the number of seedy looking establishments and love hotels, so be wary - especially if you're travelling with family. However, there are a couple of decent supermarkets if you need to stock up on supplies, and several nice restaurants to go to in the evenings that are reasonably priced.Breakfast buffet is a bit limited in choice and variety as well.There is no ATM on-site either which can be inconvenient. I also think that the rooms should be fitted with ""blackout curtains"" as there is a lot of light pollution in this part of Tokyo, although noise was not an issue.Overall I'd say this was a good choice, but slightly on the pricey side.","London, United Kingdom","NickB97</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",252,4.0

The previous hotel I stopped in had incredibly hard beds so it was such a relief to get a good nights sleep.Our main reason for choosing this area of Tokyo was due to it's location with the Aikikai Hombu Dojo. If you have come to Tokyo to do Aikido then this hotel is just a 15 minute walk away. As this is a very large city you need to get transport if you are going to travel around it so location in relation to other things seemed irrelavent and Tokyo has a good train network that is very easy to use if you're an english speaker. There is a good selection of shops, bars and restaurants in the local vacinity of the hotel if you are just looking for a quick venture out or for food on an evening. There is also a 7/11 right below it. I've also been advised that this area of the city is the ""red light district"" of Tokyo and having experienced various areas of Tokyo I would say this seems accurate. If you are coming here with children then don't worry as there aren't prostitutes hanging around on street corners. It is likely that you may get approached by a gentleman offering his ladies services however they aren't pushy and you don't feel harassed, so I wouldn't let this put you off.The staff in the hotel seemed very friendly and the hotel even provided us with umbrellas when it was raining. When we were here in October 2013 Tokyo got clipped by a typhoon. The staff were very caring and tried to warn us about going out. When we ventured out we were pretty much the only ones on the streets. Needless to say our umbrellas all got returned to the staff destroyed by the high winds and they thoroughly understood whereas most hotels might be less forgiving.Overall, I can't fault this hotel.

We arrived from Kawaguchiko/Mt. Fuji and we were tired from climbing the mountain and still wearing our hiking clothes. I had read earlier that starting from the east entrance of Shinjuku JR Station was the easiest way to orient yourself towards the hotel, and also studied Google Earth street view. The hotel proved easy to find and looking for landmarks like Mister Donut was helpful. The check-in process was efficient and friendly. I wished our double-standard room had been a little larger given that we had hiking gear to sort through but this is Japan and smaller rooms are to be expected. Muji, Isetan, Uniqlo,Takashimaya/Tokyu Hands, etc, all within walking distance, as well as a wide range of restaurants. We even found our way to the popular and delicious Ichiran Ramen which is on the way to Shinjuku Station. The breakfast buffet included Japanese and Western options and was good. Recommend eating between 7-9:30 am, otherwise there can be a wait with other guests trying to get breakfast before they have to check out by 11am. I was also aware from prior reviews that the hotel is near the red light/club area and like clockwork, the Nigerian touts appeared on the street at sundown. Being aware if this in advance was helpful. We never felt threatened or bothered. The would ask my husband "" can I show you something?"" and quickly backed off when they realized we were together. If traveling with children, simply head out toward the main street to avoid this. There's a machine in the lobby that changes USD$ to ¥en and it was broken when we needed it. We simply went to a Seven Eleven ATM which are plentiful. The machine appeared to be promptly repaired later that day. The Lawson's convenience store at the street level is OK.......frankly we thought it was kind of sketchy for Japanese standards. Adequate for basic snack items but would not want to rely on it for a proper breakfast. Better to dine at the buffet. Overall, we were pleased with our stay, the room was clean albeit small and a little stuffy but it was mostly a crash pad for our purposes. Compared to Best Western locations in the U.S. the premises felt a little more modern and upscale. For Tokyo peak season the rate was reasonable and would stay here again.

Look it up online. Shinjuku is famous for a dangerous scam where these guys take you to a bar, drug you, and you wake up with your credit cards maxed out, no cash, and sick as a dog. That said, they are not very pushy and if you wave them off and keep walking you will be fine. We had no problems with them. It did not make us like the hotel or area less. I took off one star only because the room was so small for the price. Next time we will probably look for a hotel in Shubuya because the shopping and dining are better there.","Taipei, Taiwan","w44566</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",86,4.0

Ever since I first visited Tokyo 2012 I've dreamt of coming back and since I was very pleased last time with this hotel I chose it again. This time we had an executive room located on the 13th floor. It was 27m2 and had twinbeds each 120cm x 200cm. The executive floor/ rooms have some extras not included in standard floor/rooms such as morning newspapers ( hanging on the doorknob every morning) and plush bathrobes. Also special shampoo set ( from Algotherm, and smelling lovely) , new toothbrushes daily, razors, combs, facial creams and cleaners etc. There are an executive lounge , but don't expect to much. It's more of a meeting room but there's a drinkmachine and you can get hot and cold drinks( coffee,sodas) for free. I'll include a picture so you can see.Free wifi and it works well.Nice helpfull staff. Do use the restrooms at the reception and be amazed :) The bathroom in the room is great too.The breakfast was included in our booking. The coffee is great and the breakfast is fresh but it's nothing to write home about. You can choose to exchange your breakfast coupon for a 500 yen voucher that you can use at the Lawson downstairs. they have loads of foods and drinks.The location of this hotel is amazing. You have bars, restaurants, shops, metro, trains and entertainment on your doorstep. Yes it's in the red light district but never once were we approched or bothered of anyone. You feel totaly safe at all times!Don't miss the Golden Gai bar area behind the hotel. It's a lot of fun and a chance to connect to the locals and other tourists. They take a covercharge of about 500 yen to sit down, you get some snacks or a bowl of food for that price and the drinks/beer is about 500 yen each. Best bartime ever!Last time we avoided taking taxis since we heard it was so expensive but it's not, at least not compaired to swedish prices! They start at 750 yen and you can go far for that before it starts ticking up. For exampel the hotel to Hilton ,total cost 750 yen! The hotel to Harajuku 1500 yen and we were a party of 4 splitting the fee.We also took a taxi to the airport. The NEX and Limousine buss was about 3500 yen pp. Total cost of taxi for 4 with a LOT of luggage 21000 yen, with less luggage it would have been 18000. Only about 1000 yen more pp for not having to drag siutcases to the station ,down stairs and onboard the train. (When we arrived to Narita we took the NEX , they have a promotion for arriving visitors only 1500 yen pp )I hope to come back to Tokyo soon, I LOVE this city and I'll stay at the BW Shinjuku Astina next time for sure!","Helsingborg, Sweden","Eva K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsingborg, Sweden</strong>",40,5.0

I am not sure if because we were a couple or because we were foreigners, but never in our 4-day stay in Tokyo (or our 2 weeks in Japan), were we approached by any of these girls or men offering any kind of services. So it was an interesting place to be, located close to many restaurants and bars with a lot of nightlife options - and still noise was not a problem for sleeping.There is something i really have to highlight about this hotel- THE STAFF!!!Every single one of them in the front desk went beyond their way to help us at every moment. During our stay in Tokyo they attended all our requests, answered all our questions, provided us with advise, maps, and all sorts of helpful tips to move around the area and even go to the airport. We asked them to store our luggage for the entire day after checking out, and to reserve a taxi to take us to the train station at 5:20p.m. We arrived at 5:15 and they helped us with our luggage and the taxi was already downstairs waiting for us - all that, even when we were no longer guests at the hotel!!!. Furthermore, they had already explained the taxi driver where exactly we were going so there were no communication issues between us.If this wasn't enough, i contacted the hotel about 1 month before our arrival, asking for advise for visiting and climbing Mount Fuji. I recall writing about 10 emails during this time and every single one of them was responded promptly. Long story short, we requested advise for booking the bus that would take us to the 5th station and most importantly, a reservation in the mountain huts, because they do not have much information online and do not speak English at all! (in the hut itself they do but not in the phone number provided to make the reservations).The staff at the Best Western took the time to call the Mt. Fuji hotels, advice us on prices, room sizes and make all the necessary arrangements for us to get there. I am beyond grateful with them because without speaking Japanese, this was impossible for us. If my review is not clear enough, i am beyond grateful with the hotel staff and very happy we booked this hotel. Even when it was not the prettiest hotel we stayed at in Japan, this was without a doubt, the hotel that exceeded our expectations and the one that provided us with the most rewarding memories.I will strongly recommend for anyone to stay here and i would definitely come back here if i have the opportunity.",United States,"Maria T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United States</strong>",63,5.0

When I first arrived, I had a problem getting into my suitcase as the padlock had reset the combination to something random. I took my suitcase down to reception to see if they had anything to break the padlock. Within minuets the receptionist located some bolt cutters and opened it up for me. If you are reading this, Thank you!Breakfast was a buffet style layout with everything you could want from Japanese to Western style. The room was bigger that I was expecting from reading reviews. I stayed in a standard single for 7 nights and had all the space I could need. There was enough room for my now opened suitcase allowing me space to walk around the room unhindered. There was also a safe and a small fridge located in the room. The bathroom was nice and contained a modern shower/bath, toilet and sink. My room was located on the 8th floor facing the street, it was really quiet and the only noise I heard was from passing fire engines. The room was cleaned and sheets and towels changed daily.

It's close to Shinjuku station with lots of shopping, restaurants and bars nearby.Breakfast was included, and for a hotel it wasn't bad. They had your typical Japanese type meal as well as Western options.It is close to the red light district, and it does feel quite seedy at night, but we never felt afraid or like it was that much of an issue. It's also right behind Golden Gai, and we had a lot of fun in this area trying out small bars.The staff were quite helpful when we asked them for recommendations and assistance and they could all speak English very well. There is also free wifi throughout the hotel.There is a Lawsons convenience store open 24 hours next to the hotel which is very handy.The one issue I had was that we decided to forgo our room clean and instead claim a voucher. However, they would only issue the voucher after we checked out which didn't make much sense as we could only use it in their restaurant on the lobby floor or they had small display of some tourist type gifts for sale. We ended up not using the voucher at all.

In my experience, this was a comfortable and clean hotel in a good, yet bad location. I can't really comment on the service because I had exactly 2 interactions with them- about 2 minutes while checking in and 15 seconds checking out. They were efficient, and spoke English well enough. I'll write what I thought was good about the hotel first, then give a couple negatives, and finally write some tips. The good: The hotel was spacious and reasonably priced. We paid a total of about 62,000yen for the four nights we stayed here. We had a twin room with two beds that were about 150cm wide each.The room had enough space for myself, my wife, and my two small children (4 & 6 y.o.) to stay comfortably. I spent a lot of time searching the internet for hotels before our stay, and this one seemed to be the the best value I could find in that we could all fit in the one room. The room was very clean, and it had most amenities that you would want, and a few that were unexpected but nice such as shaving razors and combs in the toiletries. The wifi worked pretty well and was fast. The beds were comfortable, though not extremely so due to the poor quality pillows. The A/C was cool, but not as cold as I would have liked during the 34C (94F) weather we had during our stay. The room was quiet, even though it's right above the street. The only street noise I heard was from an ambulance that went by. The location is good in that it's a 5 minute walk to the subway, and a 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station. There are lots of restaurants and shopping nearby, so it was very convenient. It's also right next to Golden Gai, which has a number of narrow streets with tiny little bars stacked up on top of each other. Our room didn't include breakfast, and we didn't eat at the hotel.The bad: The location was also bad in that it's just on the edge of the Kabukicho red light district. That gives the hotel's immediate neighborhood a little bit of a seedy feel, with lots of touts trying to get me to go into their bars when I walked around by myself in the evening. A red light district is obviously not a place for kids, so when we were outside with the kids we didn't linger near the hotel. Instead, we walked across the big street about 200m north towards the subway when we wanted to find food and it was just a normal commercial district.Tips: - There is a Lawson's convenience store on the street in front of the hotel. I went in there and got some bread and bento boxes for breakfast. That cost about 900 yen per day for the 4 of us, which is very inexpensive compared to the hotel restaurant. Lawson's was also a good way to have an affordable beer- a 500ml Asahi can costs about 220 yen in Lawsons, but it's 370 yen in the hotel vending machines. - Take the Narita Express from the airport to Shinjuku station. If you have a foreign passport it's discounted 50% and it is fast and convenient. Shinjuku station is about a 10 minute walk to the hotel. - If you're a white male, like me, you will be approached by many Nigerian and some Japanese touts asking you to go to their strip clubs if you walk around by yourself. They were actually friendly, and I never felt threatened or unsafe, even when I got tired of them and was rude to them. I found it was effective to just say that I wasn't interested in their club, and they didn't bother me after that. Overall, I liked the hotel and I would stay there again.","Houston, Texas","ledlyd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",71,4.0

Getting from the airport to shinjuku was very easy using the express train, and then only 5-10 mins walk from the station to the hotel. If you didn't want to go outside from the station to the hotel, you can walk 90% of the distance by going into the subnade shopping mall underground. We found this useful at busy times and when it was Raining or very hot. The shopping mall also had some really nice places to eat closer to the station end. We used the suica travel card to get around Tokyo which made it very easy as you didn't need to buy a ticket for each journey and it worked out very cheap compared to day travel cards. Shinjuku and the smaller stations around the hotel couldn't have felt more convenient and central for getting around Tokyo. The hotel is located next door to the golden gai which is loads of miniature bars, its worth taking a look and is one of Tokyo's top places to see, it is also located in the red light district ( Do not let this put you off, the red light district is extremely safe, its not like European red light districts). We arrived earlier than our check in time and had to pay a small fee to check in early, we were happy to pay this after a 13+ hour journey and were pleased it was offered. The hotel has a 2 lift system, the first takes you only to reception and the next takes you to the floors with the rooms on, we suspect this is for security but thought it was a good idea. The room was very clean and although smaller than most hotel rooms was plenty of space for what we needed, the room was cleaned daily and there was a small fridge in the room which was useful. We also phoned reception for an iron and ironing board which was left in our room for the week. The bed seemed to be changed everyday and it may have been the long days but was exceptionally comfortable. The air conditioning in the room came in handy as the room got quite warm without it. For breakfast we were given a token for each day of our stay when we checked in, I didn't realise it until the end of our stay but if you didn't use them in the morning you could use them towards lunch in the restaurant. The breakfast had a fair choice and varied selection, it set us up for the day and great value to be included in the cost of the hotel and room! Their are more than plenty of choice when it comes to evening dinner, I would recommend the restaurant floors at the tekashimaya shopping centre or the restaurant floors above the Shinjuku station.

I stayed in a Standard Single, which was plenty of space for a solo traveller.Location: Hotel is located on the third level of a building on the main street of the Red light District in Shinjuku. Please don’t let that turn you off this place. I’m a young female- safety was priority. The district is timid by most standards. Plenty of people and lights. I was never approached or made to feel unsafe. There is a sake bar, a Lawson’s convenience store and a tempura restaurant beneath the hotel. It’s an easy 5-10min walk to Shinjuku station. There are also plenty of eating, drinking and entertainment options in the surrounding area. The room- clean and spacious. It’s not a very big room, but there was a desk, couch, double bed and still plenty of room to spare. The bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was spotless and featured toilet, ‘glass wet room' with separate shower & bath. The room also had a safe (big enough for an 18inch mac), air con, free daily bottled water and free Wi-Fi. Food- I enjoyed breakfast both mornings of my stay. The range was great and very fresh. You can watch the chefs prepare and replenish the buffet regularly. I was particular impressed by the western elements of the breakfast- fresh toasts, a range of fresh fruit, as well as delicious Japanese items. It was the best breakfast I’ve had in Japan. Staff- was very helpful. I have an allergy to an ingredient in the shower amenities, and the staff quickly provided alternate products to use with no fuss caused. They were very pleasant, and most spoke English or were happy to try. A great place to stay.","Melbourne, Australia","JennFlo123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",43,4.0

The hotel is an easy 10 minute walk to the Shinjuku train station. There are plenty of restaurants, shopping and entertainment in the area to keep you occupied. It is in the red light district which meant that I was approached by people touting ""services"" and what not. Just ignore them and continue to walk and they will leave you alone. I learned to develope a stoic look when I'm the area so after a few days, they left me alone. Other than that the area didn't have a seedy vibe and I didn't feel unsafe. The room is on the small side, as mentioned in other reviews but very comfortable. Service was excellent. What was really great was that If I missed my breakfast buffet which was included in my room rate, I could use the breakfast voucher for a credit of 1000 yen towards the lunch buffet which was 1600 yen. So, essentially, lunch would only be 600 yen, a real bargain. Also, if you're the type that keep your room clean, you may opt out of having your room cleaned for two consecutive days and you will be given 500 yen gift card to be used at the hotel for each day that your room isn't cleaned. Your room must be cleaned by the third day. In all my travels, I have never experienced this kind of service and what a great way to go green. I requested to be on a higher floor to be away from the noise and my request was honored.

I did not see any of the regular floor rooms, but I would recommend paying the extra money for the executive floor. The breakfast in the morning was delicious. There was a good variety of western and Japanese breakfast items. The hotel is very close to Shinjuku station. Warning - Shinkuku station is a main station and always packed full of people. Unless you are familiar with the station, plan on adding an extra 20 minutes to your schedule just to get through the station. We were late to dinner one night because of the time it took just to get through the station. This is to expected since it is a main station - we just didn't think about it at the time. Many train lines stop at this station, so it is convenient to travel to many destinations throughout the city. The staff at the hotel were extremely kind and helpful. We spoke no Japanese, and the staff all seemed very well equipped to communicate in English.

Location wise, the hotel seemed to be ideally located near restaurants and groceries and train stops, making dining and transport very easy. However, it was located in Kabukichon, the heart of adult night entertainment in Shinjuku, so laden with bars with adult-rated posters and big burly staff members at their entrance gates and the streets around, trying to entice adult men and women to come inside. I was with my young teen sons who are tall enough not to be immediately perceived as young teens until up close so I would note staff members trying to come near us then backing off once they see that my 3 sons were young teens. In fairness, they were respectful enough to keep their distance and not give us trouble but each time we would walk outside at night, I always had some fear.

The desk personnel were very friendly and helpful when we asked for tourist information. They all spoke excellent English! We had breakfast each morning (4 days stay) and it plentiful with a wide variety of cuisines. The breakfast area is small but it seemed to accomodate everyone just fine. For us, the location of the hotel couldn't have been more perfect. It's just a few steps away from the subway station entrance. I have to admit that I never exited the station and ended up at the right place (by our hotel) during our stay...just confusion for the 1st time Tokyo travelor.  There are lots of restaurants and things to see within walking distance. In fact, one of Tokyo's cool areas is just behind the hotel. There are hundreds of tiny bars that hold 6-12 people all along a walking path. Don't worry though, it seemed to be a place where foreigners pop in and experience a small pub atmosphere for a little while and then try another small 'pub'. Our son was with us so we didn't experience the nightlife but it certainly seemed like a place to visit!

The lobby is upstair from the road and an elevator is available. The dimensions of the room were a bit small as usual in Japan; the width of the bed was a little smaller than we are accustomed and with one side along to the wall resulting a bit uncomfortable due the possibility of beating against the wall. The window looked at Golden Gai but no noise was heard coming from outside.The bathroom was well equipped with the super-technology wc. Both the room and bathroom were well cleaned during all the stay.

Bed was comfortable and bathroom was well equipped, free WiFi was available, there were vending machines on each floor for laundry (coin operated). Location was perfect, only 5-6 minutes’ walk from Shinjuku station. Take the east exit at Shinjuku train station and walk down through the stairs, look for Subnade shopping mall entrance and take exit 15 to go up the stairs, once out, you will see a Mister Donut on the corner, turn left and after a little walk you will be in front of the hotel. Since the location is Shinjuku it is easy to reach any attraction from there e.g. Asakusa, Disney Land, Odaiba, Harajuku, Shibuya and even Hakone. Another good thing about the hotel is that the breakfast was included in the rate, not many hotels in Tokyo would offer free breakfast. They also give you coupons so if you miss the breakfast, you can use the vouchers at the departmental store downstairs (store name is ‘‘Lawsons’’ and is 24/7).I would recommend you to check the hotel website for seasonal deals, we booked 45 days in advance and saved 40% which was really good.

I have to say that this is one of the best hotels I ever stayed in.Location. Perfect! Very lively area, yet very safe and easily connected via subway/train which take you to other areas of the city or country. Shinjuku station of one of the city's major hubs. Lots of restaurants and shops (including major dept stores) are just steps from the hotel. 5 mins from Shinjuku station and other smaller subway stops.Room: I had a single ""business floor"" room (no longer offered). While slightly on the small side, it was the same size as typical European hotels 3* hotel. Very good layout. Great bed and furniture. Lots of lights and outlets. VERY QUIET, however I wish I could have opened the window for fresh air. Amazing bathroom/shower/toilet (oh do I miss those toilets!!)Service: Always greeted with a smile and handled all my requests very efficiently. One day, upon returning to the hotel, I stopped by the front desk to ask for an Iron. I was told one would be sent up to my room. I barely had time to enter my room and take off my shoes that someone knocked on the door to deliver it. Now, that's fast.Food: Had breakfast included in my room so ate there almost every day. It's got a nice combination of western and Asian type foods with items not typically found for breakfast such as breaded chicken and shrimps, onion rings... Lots of tables and on busy days, they ensured the tables got cleaned up quickly to avoid lengthy waits. If you don't use the Buffet and have a voucher, reception can stamp it for 500 yen credit at Lawsons downstairs. Or you can keep it for Lunch and just pay the difference. Same if you choose to forfeit room cleaning one day, they will give you a 500Y ""gift certificate"" for the hotel (not valid for Lawsons)Other: Internet is free and worked fine. TV could use more English channels (just CNN), but I later found that some channels (such as NHK-1 and DLife) often have shows or sporting events in their original language. Simply hit ""Bilingual"" on the remote to switch between languages. Laundry machines on 7th floor is a great benefit, but dryer takes a bit of time (had to leave my in for 90 mins)Only minor drawback was the lack of drawer space for clothing. Things like sucks cannot be hung or placed in the shelf above the clothing rack. Also wish window could open, as I stated earlier.If.. uh.. I mean WHEN I return to Japan, I will certainly return to this hotel. They do everything right.","Toronto, Canada","WYSIWYG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",59,5.0

I had done some research on Tripadvisor prior to booking and looked at staying in many different Tokyo hotels. All of the hotels in my price range had tiny rooms and most looked a little dated or basic. Then I found the Best Western. It looked very modern, great location, free Wi-Fi, free breakfast and pretty cheap. Too good to be true?I was extremely happy with my stay here. The location is great, very central and close by to Shinjuku train station, which means you can get to pretty much anywhere in Tokyo very easily. It is quite close by to the red light district, but I didn't see too much of the seediness associated with that. Being a white westerner, I was asked most evenings if I'd like to go clubbing or have a massage by hawkers on the street. Be firm with them and they'll leave you alone though. Finding my way to the hotel at 11.30pm after exiting the insanely busy and massive Shinjuku station was a little daunting. There are so many different exits, which means leaving by the wrong one can bring you out to street level nowhere near where you need to be. This is what I did; luckily though I found some English tourists who helped my orientate myself using their iPhone. Eventually having found the hotel, I checked in easily and was greeted by a larger than expected room with a really comfortable double bed and a nice view of the skyscrapers of Shinjuku.The room had everything I needed; alarm, TV, slippers, safe, toiletries, trouser press, air freshener (!), mini-fridge, phone, everything you'd expect and a little more. It was very clean and very comfortable. The Wi-Fi was pretty quick and reliable and there was a LAN cable too if you wanted a wired connection. Just down the hall was a vending machine (common in Japan) with a selection of alcohol and soft drinks as well as snacks. There was also an ice machine. I don't think the hotel had room service (I might be wrong) but there was free breakfast included in my room price. On the ground floor opposite the hotel was a Lawson 24/7 convenience store where you could buy snacks, drink and other things you might need. Very handy and the staff were super polite.Nearby to the hotel worth visiting, there is the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden with beautiful landscaped gardens (great for cherry blossom spotting), Kabukicho district is also close by with its noisy Pachinko slot machine stores, Yasukuni Dori is a neon-lit street with hundreds of shops and restaurants and a little further down the road you have Yoyogi park and the Harajuku district. To sum up, I would definitely recommend the Best Western Shinjuku Astina to anyone visiting Tokyo. Don't be put off by the red light district being nearby; it is there but not particularly in your face. The area is filled with great restaurants and things to see and do. Thank you to the staff at the hotel for being so friendly and polite and making my stay as comfortable as it could possibly have been. I'll be coming back one day!","London, United Kingdom","Pabs1981</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",17,5.0

The hotel is well run with helpful and friendly staff at the front desk and excellent free wifi. But having read many reviews on the hotel we think we may have drawn the short straw in terms of the hotel room. We were allocated a room on the 6th floor which is a designated non smoking floor. We are non smokers but are not overly sensitive to smoke, however the oder of stale smoke was always present in the room. We were expecting a small room but were surprised to find that one side of the double bed was right up against the bathroom wall, making it an effort to climb out of bed from that side. Also, the bathroom door was opaque glass with a 6 inch gap under and above it. This meant that the bathroom couldn't be used with the light on in the middle of the night without lighting up the bedroom. We got a very good price for the room, so perhaps we were allocated one of their worse rooms, so we will give it the benefit of the doubt.","Buddina, Australia","NauticalDreamer3010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Buddina, Australia</strong>",148,3.0

The hotel had decent reviews. I booked the Female Only Executive floor room. It is small but cosy. The bathroom is a big winner though with great shower and lots of amenities. The massage chair is nice after lots of walking around. Bed is pretty comfy and like the ability to control my room temperature. Would like a better curtain to darken the room at 5am but it is ok. Good wifi/internet connection. Breakfast is so-so but comes included so won't complain. The main thing to be aware of is that this street is the ""seedier"" side of Shinjuku because it has a lot of girlie bars on it. No one bothers me aside from a few guys saying hello, but for men they apparently get some harassment. Otherwise not unsafe and constantly bustling with people. The Lawsons convenience store at the bottom of the hotel is handy too.","Melbourne, Australia","LeavingGoodTips</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",18,4.0

Side note, Lawson is great, cheap beer and food ( sushi, cakes, steam buns etc ) As we arrived in the middle of a snowstorm it is worth noting that you can almost walk the whole way underground from the train station, you follow the signs to the East Exit of Shinjuku station and then continue to the Subnade shopping arcades and walk until you locate exit no 15 ( there are maps ), this brings you up on the main road where you continue in the same direction to Mr Donut on the corner, turn left and Lawson / Best Western is not far down the block on the same side.We stayed at this hotel twice in the space of a month, for a total of 7 nights, staying in a double room on the Executive floors. Yes the rooms are small but it would seem to be similar at all but the largest 5 star hotels in Tokyo. However the bathrooms are huge, almost equivalent in size to the bedroom, with excellent and large showers as well as the ubiquitous electronic Japanese toilet. The beds are double size and placed in the corner which is not ideal for 2 western size people, however for a little more you can get a twin room and avoid this. There is free Wifi ( ask for password on check in) and the staff were very helpful with my multiple requests for additional bedding, bag minding, change for the washing machine etc. We didnt have breakfast included in our rate but decided to eat in the hotel every morning as it was excellent value @ approx AUD$10 pp for the buffet, it is worth noting that many cafes and restaurants dont open before 10am anyway, as it doesnt appear the Japan has the cafe breakfast / brunch type culture as you may be used to if from a western country. The best part of the hotel is its location, go out the back exit and turn right, you will be in the Golden Gai area of small cheap bars. Or go back to the main road and cross it you find the more upmarket area of Shinjuku with the high end shops ( the multiple shops selling 2nd hand designer goods are worth checking out if you're in the market for a Louis Vuitton bag or Rolex watch, they are as good as new ) and great bars / restaurants.","Sydney, Australia","jow455</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",38,4.0

You turn left down this street and you will see the hotel signposted on the right hand side of the street with the signs for the hotel reception on the 3rd floor which you can get in the lift (next to Lawson).I had read many reviews that the hotel was very small but I'm not sure if it was just our room (we were on floor 13) but we had plenty of space and did not find Japanese rooms small at all, not large either but average, particularly for a budget chain hotel.

The staff were welcoming and helped with directions and bookings, but something was lacking. Comming back from day trips they would rarely take their eyes off the computer screens to welcome their guests. This was something very different from staying at a traditional japanese ryokan as we had done previously that week. The rooms were clean and modern but very small. With two large bags, we had very little space left on the floor. The rooms were well sound proofed from the busy streets but you could clearly here every single person that walked through the aisle. When it comes to location, it is good for the price but beware, it is bordering the red light district. When walking through this area we were constantly asked if we were interested in ""tittybars"" and so on. Later in the evening there were often african men following us up to the hotel elevator, trying to get us to follow them for ""a fun night"". This was a little uncomfortable. I do however recommend going to the ""Golden Gai"" district, behind the hotel. This is a series of very small streets with hundreds of very small bars (3-12ppl). We had a great night out, meeting local japanese people and singing karaoke into the early hours of the morning. This is the perfect hotel for you who wants to experience the hustle and bustle of one of tokyos bussiest districts,and doesnt want to stay inside at the hotel all day.

There are men standing outside these establishments up and down the streets trying to coax people in...rather intimidating looking men.As we returned this time with my Husband and 14 year old son the feeling we had was rather unimpressive of the surrounds and I feel that the area is rapidly declining due to this presence.

There is a heating/cooling system but you cannot get the cooling system to go below 20 degrees - the Japanese do love a warm room! Our solution was to open the curtains which worked quite well & even though it was a Saturday night and it was super busy outside, the was little noise in the room. One other random thing that happened was that we were woken at 1am on our last night by what sounded like an alarm. I got up to check things out and there was a red light flashing on top of this little box near our wardrobe. The alarm eventually stopped going but the red light kept flashing. I was about to call reception to see if we should be worried, when someone knocked at our door. My partner answered it and it was a women looking for another room - so the 'alarm' noise was her pressing the door bell outside our room, not super awesome in the middle of the night but If you at least know what the noise is that helps.

Here's the scoop:PROS:- Very close to central Shinjuku Subway station* allowing you to inexpensively explore all of Tokyo and the surrounding areas where Mt.Fuji, Hakone, etc are located.- Very Clean, average Tokyo sized rooms w/the usual North American amenities.- Located slightly off the central area, but close enough that there are a bunch of English speaking restaurants and North American franchise chains such as: Subway, Burgerking, a couple of McDonalds, KFC, Shakey's Pizza, Baskin Robbins, etc.- Very friendly staff and complimentary breakfast buffet.CONS:- Very close to central Shinjuku Subway station* which is also a con because even though its not far (5 minute walk) it can get pretty confusing to get from the station to the hotel.- In the heart of the Shinjuku nightclub district, which can be sometimes loud at night.TIP #1 At the Airport, get the ""Suica & N'EX"" combo deal: the train takes you right to Shinjuku station quickly, gives you a starter train pass for exploring & is excellent value. Once you are at Shinjuku station, You could find your way to the hotel on foot (its only 5 mins away), but there's a lot going on and can get confusing. In hindsight, we should have taken a taxi as its only $3 -$5 US and takes the driver 2 minutes.TIP #2: Avoid taking the subway during rush hour! I've been on Subways from New York to Paris and nothing was more uncomfortable than this. Sardines have more space in a tin than I did!TIP#3: If you know Japanese, Great! if not, most restaurants in this area have English or picture menus to point at. Just be polite.All and all, we really liked the hotel. It was close to everything and made it very easy to eat, sleep and see all the tourist attractions.

I then went on to placed the dirty bowls in bag, tied it and placed them next to the bin in the toilet. They can't fit in the small bin. On 10 dec, I returned to my room to see the trash is still there. I am really annoyed by the sub-standard housekeeping this hotel provides. Where am I expected to throw my rubbish? Along the corridor? Bring them to the front desk? Throw them at the manager? This is not what I expect. This hotel cannot even provide basic needs for their guests.

I have stayed at other Best Western in Canada before, however, this Best Western is quite different comparing to the ones I stayed at before. First let me talk about the location. Shinjuku is the best town to stay if you are looking for a lot of 24 hour shops, a lot of people on the street even it is 3am. This hotel is only 7 minutes to the shinjuku train station where you can hop on the train to Mount Fuji or downtown Tokyo or even Osaka. There is a metro, underground subway, that's operate a different route than the JR train line that is a minute away from the hotel. I guess not a lot of people know this, but there is actually an entrance directly across from Mister Donut. Beside the convenience location, the breakfast that they served is prefect for both Asian or westerners. For the nine days I was there, they have some varieties and some main dishes are different everyday. The room size is really no complain in Japan. The room is 188 sq ft and it's big a nought for one adult. For toe adults or more I would definitely get a bigger room. The only downside I would say about this hotel is that is too near the red light district area where people on the street always hang out coupons flyers to try to get you in the clubs. But if you say no and refuse their offer, they won't drag you in. The area around the hotel is still a safe area and the hotel is well lite and protected I found. Also, the wifi is slow when you are trying to watch videos. For browsing the net, you shouldn't have any problems. Tips, the convenience store downstairs is very handy and have a great varieties of food and drinks. Also, if you refuse room cleaning for a night, the hotel will give you a 500¥ coupon to use in the hotel.

As with all hotel rooms in Japan, it was small for 2 people; but very clean. Location was ideal -- only 8 minutes to Shinjuku train station by foot; and in the heart of all the popular department stores (Takashimaya, Isetan, Marui, etc.) and surrounded by more restaurants then you can count.

In my opinion, if you are a non smoker... stick to the non-smoking room.

Location was just in the heart of Shinjuku and walking distance to everywhere in Shinjuku. Shinjuku rail station was the main transfer point for trains. If you had a JR Pass - which you can buy at your country before arriving to Japan - you can also use JR Yamanote line instead of Tokyo subway with JR pass. It will take little longer, but you can reach almost whole main stations such as Ueno, Tokyo, Shinagawa and Shibuya. Also if you are planning to travel to Osaka or Kyoto via Shinkansen bullet train, I also suggest you to transfer at Shinagawa station instead of Tokyo Station. So that you cn avoid the Tokyo station crowd. For the airport; we took Narita express (NEX) train and in around 80-90 minutes; you will be at Shinjuku station.

The bed linens, coffee table and bathroom are all clean as well. In all, I really enjoyed my stay here.

Although the layout is good and the room is very modern and neat, it's still tight for 2 people by North American standards. Nevertheless the bed was great, quiet room and great shower.

The value was great for the price, especially considering the location, free breakfast, and wifi.

I'd just recommend making sure you know exactly where you're going to get from the station to the hotel - we had just printed off the map from the hotel website and it wasn't too helpful (use Google streetview so you can recognize landmarks to help you find it). We were upgraded to an 'executive room' so I'm not sure how different it is from a regular room but we were very happy with it - plenty of space for a Tokyo hotel, the bathroom was lovely, and lots of free amenities (face lotions and cleansers, razor, toothbrush, water bottles on the first night, etc.) so if you forget anything you're covered. The staff at the front desk were all so friendly and welcoming. Breakfast is fine if you're not picky - I didn't like a lot of things but there was enough to fill me up. Wifi works in the rooms but you'll just have to keep logging in with an email address.Streets right outside the hotel are busy with nightlife and people trying to get you to come into their clubs, so if you want a quieter location this might not be a good choice, but we liked the excitement.Overall we'd stay here again!",Canada,"anon4144</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",16,4.0

It is located right near Shinjuku station in Kabukicho, and it is on the more 'exciting' side of Shinjuku. As in, there are lots of shops, restaurants, bars, etc that is open all hours, as opposed to the more 'business' side of Shinjuku. My husband and I stayed in their semi-double room on one of the 'business floors' - it just means there is extra privacy - you need to swipe your room key at the elevator to get to our floor. We were there for 8 nights. My main concern when booking hotel rooms in Japan is the size of the room - my husband is over 6ft, so I didn't want him to feel too squished. The semi-double room is - as most Japan hotel rooms are - on the small side but was a comfortable size for the hubby. Room is clean, beds are very comfy, bathroom is also nice and to me, these are the main important points, alongside location. There is a Lawson's convenience store downstairs in the building, and there are vending machines on each floor so it's very handy. We also opted to get a room with breakfast included. Breakfast buffet is pretty good - and great for fuelling up for a full-day ahead.Walking to Shinjuku is easy once you get your bearings a bit, as Shinjuku station is huge and there are so many entrances. On the first day, lugging our bags around was a bit tricky looking for the hotel. We followed the advice to go to the East exit of Shinjuku station but ended up walking the streets looking for the hotel. My advice is to head towards the East exit at Shinjuku, go towards Shinjuku 3 Chome metro station, and exit when you see the Subnade shopping area (underpass). Head to exit 13 or 15, and once you're up the stairs, you will see a Mister Donut on the corner. Turn left down that street and before you know it, you will be at the Best Western Astina. My only criticism of the hotel: perhaps the staff should know the area and give better instructions for tourist services. In particular, we found out there was a bus to Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea from Shinjuku. Long story short, we had gone to Disney Sea by train (which I don't really recommend), but then took the bus back. Bus stop at Shinjuku is at the 'New South entrance,' which is a bit of a random place compared to the rest of the station if you haven't had a chance to really walk around Shinjuku yet. As it was late and we ended up walking along the platform back to the main part of Shinjuku station, we needed a more direct way to walk to the bus station the next day from the hotel. Asked the hotel for guidance, and guess what - they gave us the wrong directions to a completely different bus terminal - did a huge loop around Shinjuku station (whilst walking outdoors on a hot Summers day). The only few reasons we were able to find the bus terminal in the end, is that thankfully, we had been there the night before so remembered buildings around it, we had to re-read the map a few times and from having some conversational Japanese skills. On the way back, we walked a different way back to the hotel and it took less than 10 minutes - pretty much straight up the road on the other side of the station (and not the loop the front desk had directed us towards that morning). The most helpful thing we had was in fact, a map to the bus station that they had printed off for us! Despite that little hiccup (I just wanted to share for any others who plan to visit Disney), we definitely won't hesitate to stay there again the next time we're in Tokyo. We really loved the Shinjuku location and it was so easy to start so many great journeys/ adventures from Shinjuku station (Hakone via Romancecar, Studio Ghibli tour, Harajuku is a couple of stops away, metro to Asakusa and Tokyo Sky Tree, etc)","Sydney, Australia","BakedTamago</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",31,4.0

Other than a constant need to sign up for wifi every two hours, this place gets my vote for convenience, comfort and most likely my imminent return. Food around the area is good but you do have to do a bit of digging (not everyone around the area speaks English). Also there surrounding the hotel is a sorta red light district.

We were traveling with a toddler and wanted a hotel which would be near to most of the attractions and this turned out to be perfect for usPros : 1. This hotel is like 5 min from the subway station (no. 13 and 15 ) 2. Rooms are very clean and has a good ambience.3. Not many hotels in Japan have a breakfast inclusion . Thankfully this one does and has many western varieties to choose from, which was a big plus point ,considering we would have to search for a restaurant early in the morning with a toddler by our side.4. Since the location is Shinjuku it is easy to reach any attraction from there without many change in lines5. Staff can speak excellent english .Cons: 1. I m not sure if it was a problem with our room or usual Japanese trend, but the air cons are usually kept at a minimal temp,making it difficult to know if its even working !!!!! and this was everywhere we went !!!!2. It is very near to the red light area, so good for those who want to enjoy the night life, but for family with young kids it can be a little creepy.","Hong Kong, China","Dimps0607</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",19,4.0

As my previous visits have been during February & March, this time visiting in June the streets in Shinjuku and Tokyo in general are definitely busier/crowded. As a side note, as I had travelled around Western Kyushu prior to arriving in Tokyo you can definitely tell the difference in how flamboyantly individual the people of Tokyo are in their appearance which is neat to notice. Stayed at the Best Western Shinjuku Astina again during this trip, a pleasant stay, I would recommend booking through their direct site http://www.bw-shinjuku.com/ rather than the international Best Western site as you have more options in the types of rooms that are offered & various packages that can be booked. I booked the Executive room ladies package that included additional bath amenities, higher floor & ladies amenities inside the room such as an air purifier, massage chair & facial makeup steamer. Again smallish room, but comfortable for one person & a view this time. My only issue was that in booking an executive package/room you would think that this would include breakfast, but my package apparently did not which didn't make sense. I did end up paying for breakfast on my last day as I knew I had a long day ahead of me which cost me 1000 Yen. Not particularly please with that. Overall good consistent experience, good location, good room amenities, Lawson's on main floor next to escalator/elevator, close to Shinjuku station & fare in price.

The Kabukicho area is an entertainment zone with many bars, restaurants and girly bars, but I found the area completely safe and not intimidating at all. The hotel is a short walk from the JR Shinjuku train station. Come out the East exit and walk along the Shinjuku dori, cross over to the Yasukuni dori and left onto Kabukicho (Shinjuku ward office street). there is a Mr. Donut on the corner. Maybe 10 minute walk. There are very little amenities, no pool, fitness room, but computers in the lobby and a restaurant and laundry room. Plenty free maps and brochures in the lobby.

I arrived quite late after transiting from Singapore (just after midnight), and the English-speaking front desk clerks were efficient and friendly in getting me checked in (and lending me an adapter). The room wasn't huge--I don't think anything in Tokyo is--but it wasn't tiny either, and it was extremely clean, comfortable and pleasingly put together. It's quite modern (including one of those fun Japanese toilets that shoots out spray to help you, er...clean). The bed makes for a good night's sleep.The breakfast buffet is solid--it was very easy to put together a substantial, healthy meal regardless of your tastes, and the dining room itself is lovely and relaxing. Service is excellent there and throughout the hotel. it's convenient to have a convenience store located at the first floor (the lobby is on the third, FYI). I was also pleased to discover that there's a laundry facility within the hotel on the 7th floor, so all of my worry about having to haul my laundry somewhere vanished instantly. Dryers could be a little more efficient, but it's a minor quibble.On top of all that, the room prices are extremely reasonable. Shinjuku is very well located, and despite the bustle on the adjacent streets (it's a very happening area with lots of shopping and dining), I found that my room (and the hotel in general) was quite quiet. Bottom line, I'd come back here in a heartbeat. So happy with this place.","Los Angeles, California","jonplaywright</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",9,5.0

Our first stop from April 17th-April 18th was inTokyo and we decided to stay at this hotel because it would not break the bank. We were hesitant to stay at this hotel at first but the location, amenities, class and service of this hotel although not quite a four-star, it truly deserves a four star rating from reviewers. I say this because comparison to other Asian hotels that we've stayed at in the past, the Shinjuki Astina to other hotels in Asia it has some great things about it and some items to work on. The Pros:* Location: The hotel is located in the Shinjuku district, which during the day is nothing out of the ordinary but at night time this district becomes alive. Tons of shopping located just steps away from hotel. The JR Yamanote line is about a 5-10 minute walk, which for Tokyo standards that's a plus.* Price: We booked a hotel for two days and for Tokyo standards we paid a lot less than let's say the Hyatt Shinjuku. * Breakfast: A breakfast buffet was included with our hotel reservation, which was really good. The food portions in Japan are tiny, so when you get a buffet breakfast we were quite pleased. * Shower: For Japanese standards, our room had an actual shower that was accomodating for tall people, we're 6'2"" and 6'6"" -- so it truly helped. The Cons:* Front Desk: While all of the staff on the front desk was quite friendly, their English skills were not very good (granted we're in Japan, so we should speak Japanese) but this is an American brand, so I just expected a little more help -- not a major turn off but since I'm a Tripadvisor Contributor, I really want to be specific. * Room Size: Very small bedrooms, which barely gave room to possibly walk around. But in a way the nice bathroom size with good quality amenities almost offset the lack of space in the bedroom. * No Gym/Pool: While we're on vacation we like to have little workout session but this hotel did not have a gym or pool. This was a bummer, which I should have checked but again it was not a big deal for only two day staying here. Overall we had a great stay at the Shinjuku Astina, so if we're in town next year on holiday, we will be back. Hopefully the prices will stay similar to what we paid, this really made me choose this hotel over others that were just slightly above the rate.","Chicago, Illinois","FabuluxeTravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",42,4.0

We tried breakfast for our first morning...it was nothing special. We preferred to grab different foods at a bakery, cafe or department store food basements. Having stayed at the west side of shinjuku station at the end of our trip, we preferred Best Western and liveliness of East Shinjuku better. I would stay here again and recommend this hotel.","Toronto, Canada","Jennielyn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",1,5.0

The room was not huge but certainly big enough for a single traveler, had a desk, a fridge and a small couch. Very comfortable bed, nice bathroom, but no closet. It was quiet with no noise from adjacent rooms though occasionally you could hear a door slam from the corridor. Pretty nice view of the Shinjuku skyline. The location is good, close to lots of shopping and less than a 10-minute walk to Shinjuku JR station, nearly all of it underground, which is welcome on a rainy day. By the way, the exit closest to the hotel is 15B from Subnade (http://www.subnade.co.jp/english/e-floormap2.pdf) but good luck finding that on initial arrival. The area is an entertainment district, but seemed pretty tame. Two not so good points: the English proficiency of the front desk staff varies a lot, and the breakfast was sad unless you're partial to Japanese or Chinese breakfast. I don't think I'd book breakfast again, not a lot of choices for Western food.

One thing to watch out for as a single male traveller is very aggressive (for Japan) foreign pimps who try to get you in to see their girls. To avoid them walk down the back road by Golden Gai not on the main road opposite the Shinjuku ward office.The price I paid was pretty good at around 9500Y per night but the early check in charge for checking in 3 hrs before 14:00 was a bit steep at 5700Y however after a long flight I just wanted a shower.Anyway great location, good value, really convienent and exceptionally clean and modern so it was a great hotel.",London,"phototropic99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",38,5.0

Arrved at the hotel at 2pm and my husband and i were immediately greeted by the friendly reception staff and not only were we given the room immediately, we were also upgraded to a higher floor (12th floor). I have heard that rooms in Tokyo were very small but i was still suprised at the size of the double room. Once you put the suitcases down there is hardly any room to move around. Other than the matchbox size rooms, the rooms were very clean and comfortable with tea and coffee making facilities, complimentary water for the 1st day, Hair dryer, toiletries etc.. I did find the shower postioned in a strange manner (outside the bath tub) so that you had to hold it one hand to take a shower! The pillows were not very comfortable, a little flat and hard. The best part about this hotel is the location. Just up the road you find loads of shops, eating places, bars etc.. when i read reviews of this hotel, i was a little concerned about people saying that it is located in the red light district and that there were dodgy characters hanging around outside the hotel but this turned out to be a false alarm as we were not bothered by these people at all. The touts come out only after 10.30pm and they are just trying to get people into their club, i heard that this is the same in Roppangi where there is alot of nightlife around! The shinjuku station is just a 5 minutes walk away but be careful as this station is huge and very busy and you can easily get lost! take note of the exit's and entrances that you come and go from! The breakfast at the hotel was not bad. The choice was limitted but there was a little of everything to satisfy everybody. The breakfast choice was usualy 3 kinds of cereal, sausages, eggs (scrambeled and boiled), fish, ham, french fries, japanese rice and curry, miso soup, salads, fried fish and chicken, bread basket and fruits with 3 kinds of juice.The restaurant staff are always pleaseant and greet you with a wonderful smile! Wifi in the room was excellent. getting WIFI initially was a bit of mess as you have to enter an email address to get the password and the password gets emailed to you. you have an option of choosing wifi for 2 hours or 6 months so we choose the later option or else we would have to keep getting passwords everytime we needed to use the internet! There is no cable tv at the hotel so there are only Japanese tv programs available. Not too sure if this hotel is suitable for families purely beacuse the rooms are so small!

One small thing that I was impressed by was the quality of toiletries, the soap, shampoo, and conditioner that the hotel provides was outstanding. You have to have a drink at the Golden Gai which is behind the hotel, know that you have to pay a ""service"" or ""table"" fee which can be anywhere from 1500 to 2500 yen just for sitting at the bar, but it usually comes with some snacks. The places are cramp but the atmosphere is great. Another awesome bar behind the hotel is called 'Champion Bar', and it is PHENOMENAL! At Champion Bar there is no service or table fee, and it is considered a '1 coin' bar, because you can purchase many drinks for 500 yen, which is, you guessed it, 1 coin. The bar is standing only and if you are brave enough, you can give the bartender 100 yen to sing a song from a handheld karoake-remote-searcher-machine. I had a blast at this bar drinking with hard working Japanese salarymen who wanted to unwind after work with a lot of cheap drinks and loud singing. As for the food, you really can't miss with all that there is to eat around you. The hotel provides breakfast which is ok. I take that back, the sesame salad dressing was pretty awesome. I really can't speak for the service because I was really low maintenance and didn't need any assistance aside form checking-in and checking-out, both of which were super fast and easy.

The hotel is less than 10 mins walk from Shinjuku JR station and less than that to the M09 metro station. Before I went there, I studied a map and the hotel looked quite far away from the JR station. But when I arrived, it was an easy path. You simply exit the JR station from the east exit and walk around 300 meters eastward, you will find a big 6-lane road. Turn right and walk along the road for around 400 meters you will find an intersection with traffic lights. There is a Mister Donut on the opposite side of the road at a corner. The hotel is just 200 meters away in the smaller road on the same side of Mister Donut. If you have big luggage, a taxi would cost less than 1000 Yen.The room is not very big and comfortable enough for the price. Mine was very clean. A small fridge, coffee, tea, and a flat screen TV are provided. The bathroom is a standard Japanese one, not very big but not too small. The air conditioner and the internet in my room initially required some set ups, the staff helped promptly. The internet in my room sometimes was not very reliable, my be because of high traffic. The breakfast was very good. I stayed for 5 days and the menu are the same. Since the quality was very good, I have no complaints on this issue. The hotel lobby is on the 3rd floor and a restaurant on the 2nd floor. I did not try this one but ate outside or bought food from a nearby supermarket. A convenient store is on the ground floor. Food are available here as well. All in all, a decent hotel in a big city. I will stay here again next time I visit Tokyo.","Bangkok, Thailand","LeeKH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",6,4.0

It's very close to the station. We had a little trouble finding it but a tip read here helped. We came out of Shinjuku Station - after heading to the easterly entrance. It gets a little confusing there but if you head downhill then you cross a major road where you can see the doughnut place - easy walk downhill again to the Hotel. Although the rooms seem small - they are most comfortable- bathroom was plenty big enough. Wifi took a bit of sorting but the people at the desk were most helpful. We organised a tour for the day in Tokyo as it was a bit daunting at first. To join the tour we had to go to another nearby hotel but it all worked like clockwork. I can recommend the Grand Tokyo tour - although a long day gave us a great oversight of Tokyo. Shinjuku was a great place to stay - close to many department stores and good links to all transport.,"Sydney, Australia","Chermark</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",63,4.0

There is a convenience store right below the hotel which is a plus point. At night, the streets gets quite busy/rowdy though since its near the red light district but we did not have much problem with that maybe cause we were a couple.Staffs : Polite, friendly & helpful. They speak fluent English and is ready to provide you with directions by marking the maps.Room : The size is OK as we were able to fit in 1 huge luggage and 1 medium sized luggage comfortably. Beds & pillows are comfortable & clean. Toilet is great like all the toilets in Japan which comes with all the bidet and seat warmer stuffs with many buttons and all. Daily room amenities are adequate. All the channels are in Japanese and to watch the movies you need to pay 1000 yen so we rarely switch on the TV since we can't understand Japanese. Maybe they should include 1 free HBO channel or something since they accept international guests.Breakfast : Choice was little. The croissant & mackerel were delicious though. Everyday the spread is the same. Maybe 1 or 2 different dishes different but it gets a little boring as we stayed for 8 days.Overall the hotel is value for money and our stay was pleasant. It is not as expensive as the other hotels around but you get a clean and decent room.

Booked via their website and found the site very clunky and tricky to use. Arrived at the hotel - which is in a great location by golden gai in Shinjuku - at around 6pm and asked for a room on a high floor but was told there were none available as the hotel was fully booked. There was no option on the website to request a room on a high floor. We then went to our room on the fourth floor, just above reception and also the kitchen, and opened the door to be greeted by a strong fish smell. We used the air freshener spray and that helped cleared up the odour. The double room was very comfortable and of a good size (by Japanese standards) and the bathroom was nice with a decent size tub in a wet room. Free WiFi and cable TV also great. The room was quiet despite the loud streets. Unfortunately the food smell returned as the chefs started making breakfast and we awoke stinking of bacon and burgers. There was no room they could have changed us to so I thought a suitable resolution would have been to offer a deduction to the room rate but the manager, who took an age to say sorry despite this obviously being a routine issue that anyone staying in or near room 410 would experience, said that was 'not possible'. Opted to reject his offer of a late check out (and being located to another room) as it was our last day in Tokyo we wanted to get out and explore some more. This is obviously a daily issue for the hotel and I felt cheated - surely they should be attempting to fix this issue rather than playing dumb about the problem and hoping that guests don't complain? If i stayed again I wouldn't order the breakfast as it was quite average for the high price and their are so many cafe options within walking distance. Could have been great but it was our worst accommodation experience over 10 days in Japan and also one of the most expensive.","Singapore, Singapore","PJ343</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",7,2.0

High-tech toilet, plenty of hot water, good water pressure in the shower, and a nice deep tub.The location of this hotel is fantastic. There are restaurants, bars, karaoke, and convenience stores all within a couple of blocks. It's just a quick walk to and from the Shinjuku train station, which is huge and can get you anywhere. Make sure you take the East exit out of the station for your walk back to the hotel. There is a review farther down the page that gives explicit walking directions from Shinjuku station to the hotel--I highly recommend seeking out and writing down those directions. They are dead-on, and made our arrival into Tokyo so much easier. After getting to the hotel the first time, we were able to make our way back and forth to/from the station with ease. The Golden Gai area is literally right behind the hotel; I definitely recommend chilling in a tiny bar that seats only a handful of people as a neat Tokyo experience. With regard to safety, we felt totally safe walking around the area, even at 3 a.m. Obviously keep your wits about you and don't be an idiot, but as far as big cities go, I'd have to assume this is one of the safest.People seem kind of divided on the breakfast. Personally, I loved it. I'm a picky eater and stick with Western tastes, and I managed to stuff myself both mornings with rice with curry sauce, fried potatoes, lettuce salad, mandarin oranges, and cocoa krispies. Some may be thrown off by the unbreakfasty nature of many of the offerings (onion rings, salad, fried chicken chunks, etc.) but to me, that was actually a plus. I'll take that stuff over a crappy dried out pastry or prepackaged muffin any morning. Plus with the time change, my body thought it was 5 p.m. at breakfast anyway.If we ever take another trip to Tokyo, I will definitely want to stay here.","Atlanta, Georgia","Former_Badger</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",29,5.0

The hotel was just as fantastic as we remembered - clean and modern rooms, friendly service, and an excellent location in the heart of the Shinjuku action and right above the Golden Gai area. During our last stay, we were in a semi-double, which was incredibly small. But this time, we got an upgrade due to our status, and our room was the perfect size with a sitting area and a large bathroom. We were on the business/executive floor, with ""lounge access"". The hotel lounges I have used in the past had drinks, food, etc., so I expected the same. But here, the lounge was just a large meeting room. So, I wouldn't advise paying extra for a room on this floor unless you plan on using the conference room (?).The breakfast was strange, as it was during our last stay. One man I spoke to in the breakfast room summed it up well, I think: ""I mean, I like fried chicken and chips, but for breakfast?

Once at the station walk and follow the signs to the East Exit. Go up the stairs and walk forward to the street. Looking right and diagonal to the street, there is an ABC mart that you need to walk towards. Take a left at the side street where ABC mart is and you will notice the street has lots of trees. Take that side street towards the next major intersection. This will be Yasukuni-Dori. Turn right and you will see down a couple of blocks a Baskin Robbins. Turn left and cross Yasukuni-Dori on the street where Baskin Robbins and across the street is a Mister Donut on Kabukicho. The hotel is on the same side of the street as Mister Donut and just keep walking straight until you see the escalator entrance of the Best Western and the Lawsons convenience store. I took the walking view on Google Earth to see a visual of the buildings and we found the hotel within 8 minutes.

Although the neighborhood is a combination of London's Soho and Victoria areas, in Tokyo this brings all of the good and none of the bad.The hotel is adequate if no-frills. The ""Executive Lounge"" is one long meeting table with 8 chairs and a free coffee maker; there is no business center, gym, pool, or spa. The television has one channel in English (CNN), and an unnecessarily complicated pay-TV system. Make no mistake: the hotel is squarely a Best Western (not Plus or Premier, either!), but it is perfectly 3-star.The worst part of our stay experience was the hotel restaurant, Stella. We had both daily breakfast buffet (included in the room rate) and lunch buffet there, and they were borderline-disgusting. I had to force myself to find something nutritious each day, and was grateful that previous visits to Japan had given me a taste for miso soup and rice in the morning! I would have preferred to have the money for breakfast back in my pocket and purchase from the 24-hour convenience store on the ground floor -- which is exactly what we did. The hotel has a convoluted system (designed to keep the cash in its account) whereby unused breakfast tokens can be used for JPY1000 off the lunch buffet (JPY1500, also not worth eating) or JPY1000 towards a purchase from the souvenir curio cabinet or JPY500 in the downstairs store. Skipping a day's maid service also gives you a JPY500 Best Western voucher that can only be used in the Shinjuku Astina towards lunch or tchotchkes, as above. Given that major Western chains (including other Best Western properties) compensate guests with cash off the bill or loyalty program points, this voucher system is unacceptable.As expected in Japan, the staff are friendly and capable; collectively, their English-language skills are good (although individual variation is huge). They were essential to making the stay run smoothly.For another stay in Tokyo at this price point, I wouldn't hesitate to book the Best Western Shinjuku Astina.",London,"Mov1ngMaven</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",23,3.0

The staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean, the bathroom has everything you need, and the bed is very comfortable. The rooms are small by western standards, but this is Tokyo after all! The included breakfast had both Japanese and Western items, and was nothing fancy, but perfectly fine. And best of all, the hotel is located just a short walk from Shinjuku station, making it easy to get to/from Narita airport on the Narita Express train. And it is even closer to the nearest Metro station. As some other reviewers noted, the hotel is located in Kabukicho, which is the ""entertainment"" district. So you will occasionally get offered ""services"" as you walk on the street. But this is a minor inconvenience, and should not dissuade anyone from choosing this hotel. (There's a lovely path along the back side of the hotel, which takes you directly to Yasukini-dori, if you want to avoid the commercial scene.)

The room was small, but hey, you get that with Japanese hotels - the one we stayed at in Kyoto was waaaayy cramped. Even though Best Western was small, I didn't feel cramped at all. The room was very clean and the bed was soft. The TV was a good size. The staff were great, their english wasnt too shabby and a lot of them have a great sense of humour! We asked for alsorts of stuff like, where is the nearest and best Karaoke places, we went to the golden cat one.. Had a hoot of a time.. Just book more than 1.5 hours - time flies when you're belting out 70's hits! I had one little hiccup and I have to say, it was the only incident we had on the two week trip in Japan. Please let me stress, this is NOTHING to do with the staff or the hotel. In fact, the staff were very considerate and fell over themselves to help me after the event as I was quite shaken. I encountered a very drunk sexually aggressive African (I think he was african, there are a lot of africans loitering outside the fronts of stores near the hotel) at the Lawsons convenience store underneath the hotel. He was trying to get me to have sex with him!! In no way was I dressed provocatively (demure dress and tights to keep the sun off me) or tried to interact with him. Like mostly everyone else there, I was purchasing a few small sundries. Needless to say, if I was in my country I would have 'decked' (hit) him, he was disgusting and gross. This was at 10.30 AM on a weekday. If you want to avoid these types of people, you can access the hotel around the back lane which is the lane way between the hotel and the Golden Gai (awesome fun place). As I mentioned, the staff at Best Western Shinjuku were very helpful towards me, concerned for my wellbeing after that event. I was concerned that individual was going to follow me upstairs and harass other hotel patrons. Breakfast is very good. They have a very satisfactory selection of Japanese and western breakfast things. Hubby and I tucked into Miso soup every morning as well as our usual eggs and toast. The staff at breakfast and very professional - the lady that greeted us upon arrival for brekkie was very sweet! She is a lovely lovely Malay lady who spoke fantastic Japanese (of course) and she has a beautiful smile and has a very warm engaging personality. I enjoyed my brief interactions with her.We chose the hotel due to its location and price as well as from other reviews here on Trip Advisor! The Reservations department was very efficient as Hubby dealt directly with the Hotel. The price was very reasonable for a 8 day stay. Location wise, we were close to a lot of things. The hotel is extremely close to Subnade exit B15, which leads to the rest of Shinjuku station.

We stayed here for 2 nights before going off to Kyoto. We had a little trouble finding the hotel. We just happened to look up and saw the hotel name. We ended up flying into Narita instead of Haneda (last minute flight change) and the drop off point was a bit different at the Shinjuku station, so that didn't help matters. Though once we got our bearings it is a pretty quick and easy walk to Shinjuku Station.Checking in was pretty quick and easy. We got up to the room and it was about what I expected. Not the biggest room, but about enough space for us and the luggage. The beds were comfortable and all the necessary amenities were in the bathroom. The buffet breakfast was pretty good. A little bit of change up in what was available every morning. Enough of a variety between eastern and western breakfast. A good start to the day.The surrounding neighborhood was pretty interesting. Lots of bars and such. We did see one guy who looked like he was on the losing end of a fight on morning. If you get a chance go to the Studio Ghibli museum if you like animation. Pretty interesting.

The hotel was clean and well staffed. The breakfast in the morning was excellent, with a range of Japanese and Western foods, and a great place to plan the day ahead. The staff were polite and the service fantastic. We spent a morning walking around Shinjuku, visiting local temples and the older neighbourhoods, and then took a train a few stops to join a bike ride with Toyko Bicycle Tours we'd organised on the net before we left Australia. Getting to Tokyo station on our final day to catch the Shinkansen to Kyoto was easy after a quick stop off at the well positioned and signed information booth and the ticket office at the Shinjuku station.

A dining table with 2 armchairs served us well for meals as well as working on our laptops. Inside the spacious bathroom, the bathtub and adjoining shower area were enclosed behind glass panels and a glass door. Water pressure was good.

An egg station served the guest's choice of egg preparation.Two noteworthy facilities/services are the in-house coin operated laundry/drying service and the incentive voucher to opt out of a daily change of guestroom linen. The voucher is redeemable for gifts and souvenirs at the reception.A 24-hour minimart on the ground floor provided us with a daily supply of fresh fruits, drinks and snacks throughout our stay.Hotel staff were simply great, very pleasant, service-oriented and best of all, English conversant.

Being a central hub, it was fairly easy to get anywhere else we wanted to go, including Narita airport (we took the bus rather than the train, simply because timings worked out better).But the best thing about the hotel is that it is right by Golden Gai. It's a tiny area of little alleyways, filled with ramshackle bars. It's something of a time-warp, back to maybe 1950. Many of the bars only hold 3-4 people & are a fantastic place to develop a sake hangover. Note - pick your bar carefully. While some are very welcoming & friendly, some were quite obviously keen to cater to regulars only.A couple practicalities:1 - We got lost coming from Shinjuku station, due to a slightly incorrect map (from Booking.com I think). Lots of narrow lanes & Japanese addresses aren't always the easiest to decipher. Make sure your map is correct.2 - Room size. We paid the little extra for a 'Business Floor' room. It was still very compact, but sufficient for 2 average adults who pack neatly. It had a nice view over Tokyo buildings.3 - Red Light District. It's seriously low key and aside from some illuminations, basically hidden. It's nothing like parts of South East Asia. Unless you're travelling with children & you don't want to explain some things to them - then it probably won't even register that it's there.4 - Go to Golden Gai.","London, United Kingdom","Teeemo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",7,5.0

From previous reviews we were not sure what to expect as had read things such as lack luster breakfast, red light district, small rooms, rude front desk etc etc etc. Let me assure you any reviewer who has said this is WRONG, obviously has too high expectations, and for the extremely affordable price I'm not sure what they expected. This hotel is PERFECT for any stay in Tokyo. Highlights:- 5 min or less walk to Shinjuku main station (which gives access to Narita Airport Express train, JR and Metro lines) and also 5 min or less walk to Shinjuku 3-Chome (Sanchome) Station. On the corner of the block our hotel is on there are stairs leading underground that say SUBNADE, you can go under here and walk through shops to get to the station - a good way to stay out of the rain-Area has several awesome shops, bars, restaurants that have good prices - don't be scared to try somewhere even if it's all in Japanese. Standing on street outside hotel if you look towards Shinjuku station on right side 2 doors down from Mister Donut there is a 270yen restaurant and bar where all meals and drinks (even cocktails) are 270yen plus tax and the food is delicious and beer always good. Awesome value for young travellers such as ourselves-Anyone who said breakfast isn't good...how often do you have 4 types of juices, 3 types of cereals, the best miso soup ever, several hot dishes including stir fried vegetables, curries, chicken, onion rings, eggs, delicious mackerel, several types of fruit, 10 different types of teas to choose from? My guess is never - the breakfast is awesome and a perfect start to the day - and what's best is hardly any hotels in Tokyo include it-Yes rooms are small...but in a city that has to accommodation 14 million+ people...most houses, apartments and hotel rooms are small. The rooms are modern, very clean, comfy bed and pillows, contain a desk and a small couch, and have air-conditioning (and this is the cheapest kind). The bathrooms are small but the shower is AWESOME good pressure unlike most hotels, clean, new, radical high tech toilet with heated seat, all amenities such as hair brush and dryer, tooth brush, exfoliating towel, shampoo, conditioner, body wash provided. We had NO problem in the room. The rooms do not have WiFi but the lobby does and if you're on holiday you shouldn't be on WiFi anyway you should be out exploring the amazing city that Tokyo is. There is also a computer for guests to use in the lobby free of charge, or if you have a laptop the room has LAN cable access. You can also hire a laptop for 1000 yen a day (Roughly $12 AUD). If you stay in rooms 405 or 406 WiFi will work, but signal very weak. Restaurant also has WiFi so you can eat your delicious feast breakfast and get your days facebooking in all at once.-Hotel is on the cusp of the red light district, Kabukicho. And by cusp I mean walk out of the hotel at night and there will be africans standing around touting. But why previous reviewers have let this bother them we have no idea. The touters came NO WHERE near us, once they see you are not a man who is alone, they leave you alone. So if you're staying here as a male alone, yes you will be approached at night, but it's nothing to cry about in a review you just say you're not interested and keep walking- they will follow you but if you keep saying no they will go away - no big deal. It's probably the safest red light district in the world. As an extremely paranoid young girl, I walked around at night alone and NEVER felt unsafe - the presence of Japanese people is high, and although there are japanese touters, they are super friendly and helpful if you approach them lost, just because they work for a strip bar does not make them shady people. If you're in a family or groups of mixed sex they will literally not even look at you and they only extend about 10 meters each way outside of hotel, the further you go towards Shinjuku station they disappear. You also NEVER see these people during day light hours.None of us could understand why other reviewers even mentioned it.-Front desk staff are AMAZING!!! They are so helpful, cute and polite. I don't know why other reviewers said they were rude...I think a lot of westerners confuse Japan's shyness/low english skills for rudeness. Of course they're not going to strike up a conversation in English if they're not confident, but if you ask them for help they are more than willing. I asked them to help me set up my tamagotchi (RADICAL Japanese toy) and all 3 of the desk staff helped...they always smiled when we entered the lobby and we cannot thank them enough - specially Yuko, who had email contact with us before our trip to book restaurants for us.-The whole 500 yen voucher if you don't get your room cleaned needs to be organised with reception before hand, you can't just put a do not disturb sign up (like we did) and expect a voucher. Bit disappointing but who cares.-Rooms are very sound proof, you can't hear neighbours or any noise from outside. You can only hear room next door if the occupants are screaming or singing REALLY loudly (as we often were after a few drinks) and even then sound is extremely muffled and can't make it out-There is a Lawson convenience store at the bottom of the hotel which is AMAZING, sells delicious snacks, salads, sushi etc for really cheap and ALCOHOL IS SO CHEAP!!!! 500ml beers are like $3!! 9% vodka drinks 120 yen!! AMAZING!IMPORTANT: from Shinjuku station the best exit to take is the CENTRAL EAST EXIT for Kabukicho. We walked, with our luggage, to the hotel, it was fine. Take a cab if you want - but it was totally fine to walk. Sidewalks are smooth.Japan, in my opinion, is one of the greatest, most interesting countries to visit on earth. The people are so kind, cute and helpful, and although many do not speak English they always do their best to help you. We went down to Kyoto and stayed in a hotel which left us yearning to get back to Tokyo, and The Best Western. The Best Western Astina Shinjuku is the perfect hotel to stay in: it's affordable, modern, new looking, clean, easily accessible and in a great area no matter what your point of travel is, business, holiday, partying, family visit. Surrounded by heaps of cheap, yum, awesome restaurants and bars, totally awesome clothing and other shops...Don't read any further reviews, book this hotel, you will not be disappointed.","Rome, Italy","worldwinelover22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rome, Italy</strong>",78,5.0

We stayed in a standard double and with 2 big suitcases and hardly had any room to move around. The bed is also small, not queen size. The TV only has one English channel, CNN and the pillows and the mattress are a little hard.The neighborhood is ok during the day, but not nice by night. The street is full of bars and stripclubs. You can even meet a couple of drag queens in the store downstairs. It is 10 minutes from Shinjuku station, but we had a hard time adjusting to the area.The staff is friendly and helpful and the breakfast is not bad.Resuming, if you are in a somewhat tight budget, don't mind sleeping near the stripclubs and don't have too much luggage, this hotel could suit you. If not, there are other options. We will not be staying here again.","Tel Aviv, Israel","Talmi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel</strong>",10,3.0

Near shinjuku train station but at kabukicho area. So guys, please be prepared to be accosted by people when you walk back to to the hotel. I manage to find out that we can walk the dimly litted backlane where no one would ask you if you want a lady or not. Room is small but most hotels are small in Shinjuku. Even though the room is tiny, every single thing you need to make you comfortable can be found in the room. Loved the bathroom. Everything is so well organised. Breakfast is very good. Free wifi only works in the lobby area/ breakfast area & it's pretty weak. I would recommend this hotel for its location and amenities.","Singapore, Singapore","johnck88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",54,5.0

We loved the breakfast buffet even though the menu seemed to be the same for the whole week we were there. Staffs were courteous and never ceased to assist us despite the communication barrier.

We decided to book after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. We did find the hotel hard to locate at first from the train station, but it didn't take us too long to master the Japanese rail network and had no problems getting to and from the hotel after that initial confusion. The rooms were small but this really didn't bother us as they were very clean and well maintained. The hotel staff were very friendly and helped us on a number of occasions with any other queries we may of had. The convenience store downstairs is also very handy and great for picking up snacks. They also had some fruit and light meals which were good for a quick & easy breakfast. Shinjuku is a great location in Tokyo and there was lots to see and do right near the hotel. As we were a group of three couples there wasn't too much harassment from the strip club staff trying to get our husbands in the door. All in all at good place to stay at a reasonable price.","Sydney, Australia","SushiandAno</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",2,4.0

The Best Western provided the best rates for what I was looking for and I decided to go with it, normally I stay with Marriott, but the choices between a Courtyard and a Ritz Carlton, both of which were at least double what I spent at the Best Western made this a great choice. It was clean, though the lobby was very worn looking in places, and the amenities provided were beyond adequate. It was easy enough to get to the train station on foot and finding my way around wasn't that difficult when I had a decent map. I would absolutely consider staying in this Tokyo hotel again.","Eugene, Oregon","joshinnorthGA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eugene, Oregon</strong>",74,4.0

My next stay will probably be the 7th time. It’s certainly a level above most other Japanese business hotels in the same price range. Pros:- Excellent location in busy Shinjuku.- Clean and modern rooms – not the biggest ones, but perfectly fine.- Nice bathrooms (not like the cramped boxes in ordinary Japanese business hotels).- Quick and efficient check in and check out.- 24h Lawson convenience store by the entrance.Cons:- The Kabukocho-area can seem a bit shady at first, but it’s perfectly safe.- Rooms facing the main street can be noisy.The hotel can be a bit tricky to find the first time, and the streets of Shinjuku are often packed with people. However, the Subnade underpass gives access directly from the station to an exit about one block from the hotel. Don’t remember which exit no, but the hotel staff will surely be able to tell you.The service is excellent – they even let us store our large luggage during a 1 week trip to Kansai, since we stayed with them a last night before going back home.",Stockholm,"Krokodilen123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm</strong>",14,5.0

One might not like that it is at the beginning of the red light district and the number of foreign club hosts who try to drag you into one of their shady establishments is increasing but besides that there is not another location at this quality at this price.Rooms are clean and cosy, shower is efficient and doesnt look like the standard ""box shower"".Bed is comfortable. As for me price/quality is the best I have found in Tokyo in the mid-price segment.Service from Front Desk could be better and more friendly but keep in mind that this is not a luxury 5 stars resort.I prefer a rate without the breakfast buffet, save the JPY1'000 and invest it otherwise, the buffet at Stella although the variety is huge, it is just crap.","Erlenbach, Switzerland","Sveenz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Erlenbach, Switzerland</strong>",63,4.0

Lots of choice for both Western or Japanese style or a combination of both.The east side of Shinjuku is quite....interesting. Yes, after about 7:00pm all kinds of nightlife appears on the street but we were in no way encumbered by the activity. Hotel is a short 10-15 minute walk from Japan's national garden, which, during our stay had a wonderful display of cherry trees in blossom.
