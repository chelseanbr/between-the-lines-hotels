One night me and my girl were on our way back in from a night out and walking past the front desk there was a strong smell of marijuana which is legalized where I live. I decided to ask Courtney if she knew where I can get some for myself and she was nice enough to sell me some of her own then she even called a dealer to come to the hotel personally which I thought was really nice. All together I enjoyed my stay at this hotel despite the poor housekeeping the fact that I was I was able to get pot right from the front desk made it all better.

She even went to the subway station with us to show us which one was downtown and which one was uptown. That was absolutely magical because we have gotten lost trying to find the downtown train.

The bedding - when clean - was very comfortable. Had it not been after midnight, we would have contacted housekeeping right away. After reporting this to front desk the next morning, they changed us to a different room on a higher floor. This was also due to how loud our previous room was. We live in a city and frequent NYC - not typically annoyed by noise. It is a boutique hotel; however, you can barely get close hung in the small closet. No drawers. Extremely small shower stall.

Our trip started out badly when my 11-year old son and I arrived at the hotel after a long day of cross-country travel to learn that the room we booked (deluxe two doubles) had been given to someone else. Courtney was very apologetic and did what she could to make it right, including free breakfast and offering to move us to our desired room midway through our 4-night stay. With Ess-a-Bagels around the corner we weren't going to be eating breakfast at the hotel, but I appreciated the gesture. She also offered us a free room service dinner which we didn't take advantage of because we'd already secured reservations for dinner each night of our trip, but again the gesture was appreciated. Courtney was the highlight of this place.We woke up the next morning at 9 am EST (which felt like 6 am to us) to someone knocking loudly on our door. It was someone from the hotel asking if they were going to move us the next day. I was confused, woken out of a sound sleep, and told them yes that we would be moved. Then she left. We didn't fall back to sleep. I thought it was odd that we didn't receive any housekeeping at all this day.That afternoon my son and I were relaxing in the room when the scent of cigarette smoke filled our room, despite it being a smoke-free hotel. We literally had to leave the room because we both got headaches. I called the front desk and they said they'd try to take care of it. The smell came and went for the next day.That night, New Year's Eve night, our next-door neighbors threw a party to end the decade. I had to call the front desk two times in the middle of the night to ask them to have our neighbors turn down their music. I finally fell asleep at 6:30 am, exhausted and frustrated by the hotel's inability to enforce policies. New Years Day we were out for the day. I got a call from the hotel at about 11 am and they said that we hadn't packed our things to be moved. I was confused as we hadn't been told what time we'd be moved and didn't realize we had to prepare for that. Ultimately I told them we'd just stay in the room, as long as the next-door neighbors (partiers) had left. It was all such a hassle and the lack of communication from the hotel was really apparent. I asked why our room hadn't been cleaned the day before and she told us that if anything is left on the bed they won't clean the room. Good to know?On the morning of Jan 2nd we were getting ready for the day when I heard someone's voice out in the hallway. They proceeded to OPEN OUR DOOR and the man walked halfway in before leaving, startled, saying he was there to check the minibar. Excuse me?Hotel Henri was far from what we needed it to be: relaxing, comfortable, a good home-base for our NYC travels. Beware! This hotel is none of those things.","Seattle, Washington","mrsmedina</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",27,1.0

Came back to my room at 10:30pm and it was cold. Turned the heat up but after a few minutes realized i had no heat. It was cold! Called the desk and someone came up around 11pm and tried to lie to me that I didn’t have the thermostat turned high enough. I told him I knew better. He took the HVAC unit apart, asked if he could use my corkscrew since he didn’t have a screwdriver and he proceeded to do something that gave me hot air. Two days later i filled out something like a review where I said I’m the shower was leaking on the floor and mentioned the heat had been off when I arrived but that it had been fixed. They entered my room even though I HAD A DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door. Management hasn’t read that I had said the heater was fixed (they later admitted they hadn’t read it) and this guy made it where the heat wouldn’t turn off so it was 80 when I got back. This guy also tried to fix the shower leak and took my towels, threw them on the floor, put his dirty shoes on the towels and dragged them around On the floor then just left them with the dirt from his shoes on them. Unreal! ai at 10:30pm i have to wait for someone to come fix the unit that didn’t need fixing. It took him about 15 minutes to fix it once he got there. he apologized for coming into my room with a DND sign on the door but said the GM told him to ignore it. I asked him why he had Left the dirty towels on my floors and he said he left them for housekeeping to get. So that was a lie because my DND sign tells them not to come in. So at 11pm+ at night I’m having to deal with this crap. Another guy finally brought more towels. So 2 out of 4 nights I stayed I was up at 11pm+ dealing with this. And they didn’t even offer me a complimentary breakfast or say they were sorry. Nothing! I had friends staying in another room And they were treated with total disrespect, too.

The TV turned itself off every 11 minutes and lost signal even more often. We like small European style rooms, but this new hotel design is a laughable failure: there is not enough room for one open suitcase, let alone two. The tiny closet is too small to close with hangars! No room to sit except the low platform bed. The sheets were not changed (housekeeper said it is a hotel policy!). The TV remote control was lost in the made bed. Unfinished and chipped paint.Tiny, angled corner shower with dangerous corners. Water leaked out, creating a sizeable puddle. Fancy robes are shown in advertising. but were not in rooms. Hot side of the shower valve is so loose that it fell to scalding temp.

There is so much I want to say so I thought it would be easier to break it down into sections. Location...On 24w Street this hotel is perfectly located to walk almost everywhere, which we did. We decided to travel to the hotel on public transport from the airport, although easy, it was a bit of a hassle with more than hand luggage. HotelI must admit, when I walked in I was surprised at how small the reception area was. The pictures on the website gives the impression of a much bigger reception. This wasn't a problem, just took me back a little. When we went to check in with the receptionist, she seemed a little preoccupied with a personal phone call but did welcome us. When she had finished the call she had noted on the computer that it was out wedding get away and congratulated us. Which was a nice touch. The hotel itself is lovely. I was very happy with the choice, however I do agree with some of the comments that it could do with some TLC. Just a lick of paint would be enough, where the maids had hit walls with trollies etc. No issues, just noticeable for a 4 star hotel.Rooms...The room was lovely. Having been to New York a number of times I know that rooms are not massive. But the room we were given (1401) was perfect for 2 of us. Large comfortable bed, climate control, flat screen TV, safe, free bottles water and coffee machine. The bathroom was beautiful and large. Power shower and plenty of room. Turndown service was regular and to a good standard. We were on the 14th floor which really helped as we didn't hear any noise from the road below which is great for New York as it meant we had a great night sleep every night.Also, we were welcomed with a bottle of champagne and a wedding card to Mr and Mrs … which made us laugh as a gay couple, but it was a lovely gesture and the champagne was enjoyed. Staff...I have to give a massive shout out to Bernie in the hotel lobby bar. He was the star of our stay. We popped in for one drink on the first night and ended up going in every night just to see Bernie and hear one of his hilarious stories. He is a credit to the hotel and definitely someone we will never forget. I know our paths will cross again in the future. Also a shout out to the 2 Carlos's especially the one from Puerto Rico who's sense humour made us laugh!All reception staff were friendly and helpful and could not do enough to make our staff perfect. Just a few points for improvement...One of the reasons we booked this hotel was the free happy hour vodka in reception. We never saw this once. Maybe a note to advise when it will be offered so customers know. There was only hot water and hot chocolate in reception. Although this is a nice touch, it would be a lovely gesture to also offer coffee, especially on the cold days.Overall...The hotel is perfect. One of the best we have stayed in New York. We didn't try the roof top bar as we enjoyed our time with Bernie in the lobby bar. We also didn't try any of the food as there are plenty of restaurants around, but from what I saw the good looked and smelt delicious.We will definitely be coming back to stay and we never stay in the same hotel. Although I have pointed out some improvements, these are no way negatives. I would highly recommend this hotel and I know you won't be disappointed.Thank you Hotel Henri! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","London, United Kingdom","GayLondonTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",19,5.0

If you go one block in either direction you can catch basically any subway line. The hotel has a great restaurant on the lobby level and an amazing lounge on the roof level. There are so many great restaurants within walking distance that we wished we had more time to experience all of them. The greatest part of our getaway came as a surprise. When we were checking in the manager was at the desk and heard us talk about it being our anniversary and that was the reason for our visit. The next day when we were out exploring the city the hotel had placed a bottle of champagne along with a hand written card that wished us a happy anniversary. This was so unexpected and it really showed us that the staff really cares about their guests and that they also listen and are not robotic fake. On our last day at the hotel we asked for a car to be arranged to the airport and to our surprise they had a luxury vehicle waiting for us for the same price we paid a yellow taxi to get there. We had to ask who the manager was who made sure to make our stay special and they said his name was James. So we have to say thank you so much James. We want you to know that your entire staff made us feel so at home and we had a feeling it was because they have a great manager.

Offering quiet, well-appointed rooms, the Hotel Henri afforded us the perfect place to feel pampered. Its excellent location, surrounded by amazing restaurants and only minutes from where my daughter was studying, also exceeded our expectations. While she was in class, I was able to attend a showing of To Kill a Mockingbird, to visit lovely shops in the Flatiron District, and to relax with a book in nearby Madison Square Park.

To my fellow business travelers: beware the frustrating check-in policy though. I am in NYC for business every few weeks and it is the first hotel I’ve booked that required a credit card authorization from my company before I could check in even though it was booked through company like I always do. So I had to spend an hour tracking someone down before I could check in, eventually being forced to put it on my personal card anyway.They gave me a whole “this is NYC” spiel about how it was for security (as if I’ve never been there and haven’t lived there) blah, blah, blah...I don’t care. Make it easy for the consumer. Nowhere else I stayed does it. It’s never a problem if booked through corporate travel service. Customer comes first.While the check-in staff was a pain about it, the morning staff was great and offered a complimentary breakfast to make up for my troubles. It was awesome with vegetarian options. Rest of the staff great too.Was busy the whole trip so not at the hotel much but they gave me a nice quiet room upon request and it was perfectly adequate and cozy. Check-out staff was also great. Showers and bathrooms great and bigger room than usual in the city. Good free WiFi. Only complaint really was the difficult check-in. Oh, and gym was four blocks away but complimentary.

I stayed for 5 nights, it never got better. The bed was squeaky and way too soft, bedding very basic. The staff are unfriendly, they almost seem bothered by having to work, especially the tall waitress in the restaurant who (from my experience) covers the breakfast shift. Every morning I waited at least 15-20 min for the kitchen to toast a bagel and boil an egg-there were only a max of 4 guests at a time. Really?? When I checked in I found rotted milk and carrots in my mini-fridge that must have been there at least a week. The bathroom fan is so loud I could not hear my phone ring. The fan runs while the lights are on, so constantly. The air con was equally noisy, I had to buy earplugs to sleep. The rooftop bar seemed a good idea, I think it’s ran separately. Always quiet which is good since it’s tiny and the only outside space is a narrow walkway with rickety bar stools. The outside restaurant area (called Rodos) at the front of hotel is quaint, but sadly served by the slow kitchen and unfriendly waitstaff. For the price, I would Highly recommend staying elsewhere.

I was a little concerned having read lots of reviews that said that the hotel wasn't very clean, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's not as pristine as you might expect, but it certainly didn't feel shabby or dirty, just ""well used"", which is a good sign because people want to stay there!We had a superior room and were pleased with the size of the bed and the bathroom. There isn't much storage in the room...we hung a few things up but mostly lived out of the suitcase because there were no drawers or shelves to put clothes. There was a useful stand to put the case on, and a large full length mirror. The safe was great...the lid lifts up so it's easy to fit tablets and laptops in.The room was clean, where it mattered. There was an empty pizza box out on the balcony so I don't think the cleaners are the most thorough, but the bed was fresh, the floors were clean and the bathroom was immaculate. Plenty of towels, which were replaced every day, and the shower was amazing! The water and coffee were also plentiful, and we were encouraged to take water out for the day with us as well as having it in our room, which we thought was very generous. The city maps available in reception were the best ones we found. Don't bother buying a tourist map before you go...these freebie ones are brilliant!The location of the hotel is the best feature by far. We couldn't believe how close we were to everything and how easy it was to take the subway when we wanted to go further afield. For that alone, I'd recommend this hotel a million times. We had excellent drinks in Bo's and the Taqueria opposite the hotel, and the Tappo pizza next door was expensive but very tasty and lovely service. 230 Fifth rooftop bar had wonderful views of the Empire State Building and plenty of space to sit outside in the evening sunshine. Eataly had a beautiful rooftop bar as well, so we didn't use the rooftop bar in the hotel because there were so many great places elsewhere!The service from the staff was lovely.

It’s easy to get anywhere you want to go because it’s close to the 23rd St station at 6th Ave and the 23rd St station at Broadway. At the end of the street is Madison Square Park which is a nice hangout with a view of the Flatiron Building. The neighborhood has tons of excellent restaurant choices within a 5 minute walk. The room itself was small and basic, but modern and very reasonably priced compared to other places in the neighborhood. My room 704 was clean except for the dust on the window blinds. I was traveling solo which was a good thing because my husband and I would have difficulty sharing this Deluxe King room. The closet cabinet was sort of a joke, because it’s not deep enough for hangers. Because of the sliding doors on the closet you can only hang clothes on one side. Thankfully this problem was solved by a huge amount of hooks on the wall. The letters on the wall that say SHOW TIME can all be used as hooks. And there are multiple hooks in the bathroom. One of my biggest complaints about almost all hotel rooms is why can’t they have more hooks? So I was pretty delighted by the hook situation here. One more critique is the lighting in the bath is not bright enough to do makeup. But there is a floor lamp near the desk with very bright bulbs so I sat facing this light with my travel mirror to do my makeup. The vanity in the bath is small but I liked how there is a ledge above the vanity where you can line up all your toiletries. My mattress was kind of creaky and squeaky, could probably be replaced.

They were sweet, they smiled, and they were that kind to everyone, so Kudos to them! I asked for a quiet room and I got a quiet room! The only loud noises were the BOOMS when other guests would shut their doors, so if the hotel would suggest for guests to shut their doors gently but securely as a courtesy to other guests, that would completely eliminate the noise disturbance. My room was COOL when I arrived, as the AC had been running, and CLEAN. So important to not find other people's hair in the bathroom, etc., so Kudos to the Housekeeping Staff! The only minor bummers were: no shower cap; no shower gel -- bar soap just isn't my thing; and the shower did leak and to form a puddle along the doorway. I was just careful stepping onto the marble floor and after drying off, I laid down the towels to soak up the puddle. Back to the awesome points: Black out curtains; large flat screen TV had lots of channels to choose from, and of course there was Wi-Fi. At check-in I was given two complimentary drink tokens, (that I didn't use,) as they were going to have a rooftop happy hour, (I slept through it!) and in the lobby they had two ice cold dispensers of complimentary lemonade and ice tea with vodka and another bottle of booze, which surprised me, lol!

The hotel is in the heart of the Chelsea/NoMad area and is convenient to everything. Rooms were typical small but quirky NY hotel rooms with modern decor & updated bathrooms. Unlike other reviews, the A/C in our room did a great job in cooling our room, which was a stark contrast to the excessive heat outside. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel staff were warm & friendly, made small talk, greeted us each time we came in and out. No one was unpleasant. Little touches like the hydration station in the lobby (with an occasional bottle of vodka & tequila thrown in to add to your lemonade or iced tea) were much appreciated. My husband and I were standing outside melting in the heat while we consulted our map, and Antonio ran outside with cold bottles of water for us. For the low price we paid for the room, the service was exemplary.

We were supposed to stay at Hotel Hendricks but they didn't open on time so we were offered Hotel Henri. I must say I wasn't happy at first but what a blessing in disguise. We were greeted with smiles by everyone! Our room was ready early, like 1pm so we were psyched. Tayvon went above and beyond with all of our requests. There was nice cold lemonade and ice tea in the lobby along with Tequila & Vodka.......now I'm really starting to like this place! This was the scenario all weekend. They kept our luggage on our last day after we had checked out. Rooms were CLEAN!!! For this reason alone, I'll be back. There aren't many rooms on each floor so that was a plus. We stayed on the 17th floor and the rooftop was on the 18th. Wasn't noisy at all. There is an outdoor seating area out front where you can chill and eat/drink.

Coming in from a full day of travel and getting checked in quickly with courtesy is always uplifting. In comparison to other hotels I've stayed the late check-in process goes smoothly and doesn't result in a lost room. The upstairs bar is also a nice place to bring a guest and enjoy a glass of wine.

I know that hotel rooms in NYC, especially boutique hotels, are shoe boxes. so I got a deluxe (read: normal) hotel room for my mom, and a PREMIERE deluxe (read: larger, with private balcony, higher floor) for myself and my wife. I reserved this directly from the hotel website, not from a 3rd party travel site. I have a confirmation email with both rooms, showing one being 50 dollars a night more than the other, and laying out clearly that one is premiere and bigger with a balcony. I go to check in, and the desk clerk claims her system doesn't show a room upgrade. it sure shows that I am paying more for one room though. The unhelpful clerk acts as if I'm bothering her that they aren't honoring my reservation. Pretend you reserved a fancy dinner at a patio table for six, 3 months in advance, and when you get to the restaurant, the host doesn't understand why you are upset that they've reserved you a two top by the bathroom. So after pulling teeth, the desk clerk agrees to at least credit me the difference since I am overpaying now for a normal room. guess what? it's now 3 days after I've checked out, and there is no credit on my card for the difference. Add to this that the rooms are on floor 9-17 and one of two elevators was out of service all weekend, with 10 plus minute waits for the one working elevator. at least we walked off our dinners by climbing up and down 9 flights of stairs.

There were two double beds in the room. Normally a Wyndham Hotel has 5 foot doubles but these were only 4 foot 6, so a bit of a squash compared with what we're used to, but OK. Very comfy beds and pillows, anyway. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was excellent. Communication with the hotel beforehand was difficult, as I emailed to make an enquiry and a Dayhana Cobles eventually replied but only answered half the query, then when I wrote to her again, I never got a reply at all. Other people I know who have stayed here have said the same thing, that email contact beforehand is very poor. I had informed Dayhana that it was my daughter's 21st, so I was hoping there would be a 'happy birthday' for her when we arrived, but there wasn't. Half way through our stay, they wrote to us asking how it was going, so I said I was disappointed about the birthday being ignored and that evening a bottle of cava in a bucket of ice was left in our room. Unfortunately we got back quite late and all the ice had melted, plus we weren't quite sure it was for us and not a mistake, but the thought was there! The one down side about the hotel was there was a grid outside over a drain which was loose. I noticed it the first day but assumed they would fix it but the next day I managed to step out of a taxi and walk onto it so that it tipped up and I had quite a bad fall onto my knee. The staff were helpful and brought me some ice for my knee and they asked if they could call an ambulance. The receptionist asked me about it every time I went by after that, so they were caring about it, although I couldn't help thinking it was because they were worried I might sue! Hopefully they will now get the grate fixed in place properly. Anyway overall we enjoyed our visit and the location was excellent for visiting New York, so I would recommend it.","Oxford, United Kingdom","fionafreesia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxford, United Kingdom</strong>",51,4.0

The tiny (expected for NYC) rooms are not helped by the faux stage decor--it is not a place you want to spend any more time than you have to, and Wyndham cheaped out on the soundproofing--you can hear everything going on in the next room. But back to the puke in the elevator--we stayed over a weekend, and the rooftop bar (not anything special) is apparently a haven for 20-somethings from the suburbs--which is not conducive to a small hotel vibe. We returned from a night out at 1:30 am, and one of the 2 elevators was out. Not a problem, if you're only serving hotel rooms, but there's the rooftop bar to deal with. So the elevator is super slow, and when it finally gets to the ground floor, it opens up, and a load full of inebriated college kids comes out, and it stinks in there, because someone puked. The hotel staff quickly mopped it up, but with no other elevator option, that was not the most enjoyable way to finish an evening. Basically, this hotel is a good cheap option in a great location, which is why it is loud, cramped, and puked on. We will not be returning.",,Bret S,4,2.0

On the day of check out three different people knocked at my door even though it was still before 11:30 (check out at 12). I forgot my shirt when I changed to a different hotel (that was much better and also cheaper) so I called 30 mins after I left to notify them. They said that they would email me when they found it. Never got an email and when I called the next day they still said that “they were working on it”. I ended up just going there and look for it myself and finally I got it back. The cleaning could also have been better. I left my pajamas on the bed and when I came back they had put it on the dirty floor under the radiator - why would they do that? Also, even though I stayed at the 17th floor the window was like it didn’t even existed, completely blocked, which left the room in darkness.

We have earned max status with several chains to try them out. Wyndham usually results in disappointment, unfortunately. We have only truly enjoyed a handful of locations. The best ones being Hawaii, and now Hotel Henri.If it isn't poor staff and dingy looking places, it's not advertising the location properly (looking at you Ravel with your boom boom rooftop bass making it nigh impossible for a good nights sleep), to flies on the food, to no food at all, Wyndham has often been a big letdown.When I checked in I mentioned to the front desk we were on the 14 day challenge to match max status with Wyndham, we usually have had bad experiences and were really hoping things would not be that way here. He apologized for our poor prior experiences at other hotels but said he would do his best to make sure things were good here. He then spent a few minutes talking about the new restaurant and a michilin star restaurant nearby when I asked for food recommendations. I am happy to say that our experience at Hotel Henri was the compete opposite. When we got to the room we received a small upgrade due to being max status. In our room was a bottle of champagne. The room was clean and well maintained. It also had all the little extras you might need like tooth paste, a sewing kit, makeup removers etc. The only negative about the room was you could hear peoples doors and talking when they were in the hallway.In the evening they had fireball whiskey, rum, cider, and hot chocolate for guests for no additional cost. Seeing as how it was cold this was a really nice touch and something I saw several guests partaking in. The restaurant was a bit on the pricey side, even for new york, but it was all delicious and tasty. The service at the restaurant was fast and attentive. We did not have to ask for anything at any time. The bellpersons I would also like to throw a shoutout too as they brought in and out over 30 bags for us as we had done a lot of shopping. Pro tip: You can find free parking on the weekend by going where TWo Brothers Pizza is and parking on that area. Most of the parking restrictions are removed for Saturday and Sundays.

Upon check in we waited close to 10 minutes for a front desk staff member, the door man kept us company and was a great guy. The front desk lady finally came and was friendly enough and professional. She told us we could select pretty much any floor we wanted, however she did not bother to tell us that their would be a party until 3am on the Saturday night at the bar. Had she done so we obviously wouldn't of selected the 17th floor which is right below the bar. I have a recording of it on my phone and it legitimately sounds like we are playing music from a speaker in our room until 3am. The door man felt bad for us and said we should call and try to switch rooms, however the front desk informed us all rooms were occupied and that all they could do for us was bring ear plugs. The doorman said that someone should of told us about this at check in because they have known for atleast a week about the party. We also planned on using our 2 complimentary drink tickets on the Saturday night, however due to the private party in the bar we were not able to even use them on the Saturday night. Again something you think the staff would inform us about at check in. The kitchen is under renovation so you cannot get any food, which is something that wasn't told to us until we asked how late room service goes, once again something that should be told to you upfront. The elevator situation which already had some serious issues became even worse when 1 out of the 2 broke down completely on the Sunday. And lastly I dunno how you are promoting a continental breakfast package but in reality its just muffins and danishes, 0 warm food such as eggs, bacon etc and the coffee and hot water were both empty at 9am when I was there because the poor women running it has to go all the way to the main floor to refill everything (18 floors down). 1 positive is the the cleaning staff and door staff were amazing and the rooms are actually nice. I chose this hotel because I am in the military and we get a discount on Wyndham Hotels so I thought I would give it a shot, however next time I think I will choose to pay a little more money and get ALOT more value.",,Safari172489,0,1.0

Dyhana was the first person we encountered and she couldn't have been nicer or more welcoming to us. After making an emergency landing in Newark, NJ flying in (thanks a lot Delta) and dealing with extremely rude Delta staff when trying to figure out a ride to our hotel, we were very pleased to find a friendly person like her at the front desk. Dyhana made us quickly forget about this disastrous experience and put us at ease from the moment we walked in. Delta could learn a thing or two from Hotel Henri. The hotel provided complimentary hot chocolate and apple cider in the lobby along with vodka and fireball to give it an extra New York kick. Our bellhop Danny was funny and very welcoming. We interacted with most of the staff during our week long stay and they all exhibited the same high level of professionalism. No matter what time of day, there was someone at the front desk greeting us and wishing us a nice day when we walked through the lobby.Our room had all the amenities we needed for the week given that we were out on the town most of the day. The only thing it lacked was a refrigerator for the food that we came home with. Water was provided to us on a daily basis and housekeeping staff was not hard to find at any hour of the day. Halfway through our trip, we requested to be moved to a balcony room and the hotel happily obliged. There were only two aspects of our stay which were not perfect. One of them being the thinness of the walls. We could hear doors slamming in the hallway (which was very tiny) as early as 6:30 in the morning. We were unable to sleep in any day due to this. We brought this to the attention of the staff and they told us they would be addressing this as they sought to continue to improve their guest experience. The hotel's lobby restaurant was also undergoing renovations and the daily morning ""breakfast"" was moved up to the rooftop bar. Our stay included breakfast each day but others were charged $10 per person for coffee, juice, donuts, pastries, frosted flakes, and bananas. Perhaps things are different in New York but I would not have paid $10 for this breakfast spread and we witnessed many patrons who were disappointed at the options once they arrived at the rooftop.

The ventilation in the bath room makes you feel you're still in the plane that brought you to NYC, and the one next to your room door, in the hallway, is at least as noisy (and this one never stops... 24h a day!). Don't choose a room to high up in the building because you'll be using the stairways a lot (the lifts are so slow that they could as well be manually operated).

I was greeted by the associate at the front desk who was really welcoming, but the room was not ready even though I called to request a room early. The decor for the hotel seemed dingy and dark I guess ok for those who like that, many cigarette butts outside near the restaurant. As I waited for my room I realized 2 other hotel guest check in, did the hotel staff forget about my room? I asked again, and “Oh” yea the room was ready. After checking in I was handed keys to my room, as I waited for the elevator I overheard the front desk associate get reprimanded by management?? I think something like that should be done behind closed doors. My room was perfect, tiny but perfect, we faced another building in the back so we had no view, but who wants to stay in their room in NYC. Fast forward to our check out Saturday morning, my girlfriend and I party hard the previous night and just wanted to have breakfast and go home and maybe an aspirin. The front desk manager Sandy, insisted that we post a review about our stay even offered drink vouchers for their bar. As if that is what we wanted to hear after a long night out.

Checkin/out: Fast, efficient and friendly. Can’t fault in any way. Now onto the fees. The Henri charges a facility fee on top of the nightly rate and this is one of the reasons for the 4-star. I honestly can’t remember if this was shown at the time of booking, but either way, it’s a deceptive fee used by hotels to be able to lower the headline nightly rate. This old school practice is slowly disappearing but just make sure you factor this in as it’s still charged by the Henri.Room: Spacious in NYC standards (or so I’m told). Modern and well equipped. The shower leaked badly, soaking the floor. Lots of mould in the shower as well. This seems to be in multiple other reviews, so hopefully management take note, as it slightly lets down an otherwise perfect room.Noise: Seems to be mentioned in multiple other reviews. You will hear horns, sirens, trucks etc. But it’s downtown NYC, so it’s to be expected and the street the Henri is on is a less busy at night than the surrounds. We didn’t find it bothered us at all.Location: Perfect location.

It has a boutique feel (with only 8 rooms on a floor) for a modern chain hotel and located in Chelsea on the west side of manhattan in between, and close to, theatre and downtown with the train only a couple of blocks away. As we walked into a very small lobby we were greeted with warm smile and checked in quickly. There are only 2 elevators so I found that we had to wait for it each time we used it. The room was small but very clean with a small modern updated bathroom. The nice robe left in the bathroom was also a nice touch as was the dental and personal hygiene kits which you often don’t see anymore in hotels. Febreze has been sprayed in room so it smelled fresh and clean. The continental breakfast was also free for rewards guests so sign up for the reward program. We grabbed muffins/pastry juice coffee and fruit. Lastly I left me cell phone charger in the room when I checked out. When I called 2 days later they located the charger in lost and found and held for me at front desk so my kids could pick it up for me. All in all I recommend this hotel highly.

The closet and desk are minuscule: absolutely not recommended for anyone who needs to work in his or her room. The cleaning of the rooms was also lax: I had to let someone know at the front desk that the bathroom had not been properly cleaned, and the sheets were never changed during my four-night stay. I left my room one morning before 9 a.m. and the bed had still not been made when I came back at 4 p.m.! The major problem I had with the room was noise. The room itself was not noisy, but the the one that I booked for my mother, which faced onto the street, was intolerably loud from very early in the morning.

I called to complain and was told, ""well, it's meant to be more like a cooler."" Ok, it wasn't cool, which meant we definitely didn't want to drink anything from it (Red Bull, champagne, wine). The wait staff at the Mykonos Grill weren't very friendly and the food is seriously overpriced for what you get. We didn't get our 10% off for being hotel guests. I guess you have to ask for it?The absolute worst thing about this place is the $25 per night ""facility"" fee that the folks on the Wyndham member hotline failed to tell me about when booking. If you look at what the fees are for on their website- water, access to a gym down the street, and some more water - it's a total rip-off and wasn't expected.

I had checked on the Wyndham site for hotels near Manhatten but not to close as to get the noises. I found Hotel Henri. Its only a 30-45 minute cab ride from La Guardia or JFK depending on traffic of course. The hotel itself is very clean from street view and also upon entering. It is a small hotel with a greek restaurant located on premises.the rooms all appear to be the same size and that size is very small, not so small that it discourages you but if your used to larger rooms this is not your place. The rooms come with a comfortable queen size bed which pretty much fills the entire room. the bathroom is also quite compact but usable. There is a mini fridge but it is filled with mini bar materials meaning no room for your own drinks or leftovers you might carry home. There is a safe, ironing board with iron available in the room. The exterior noises were non existent from my room #901. the down sides, during the evening there are get togethers on the roof top bar and that traffic can have an impact on the elevators, we waited 10 minutes for 1 of the 2 elevators to finally arrive to the lobby. the shower is going to leak onto the bathroom floor no matter what you! its a design flaw. the entire floor in our room was vinyl flooring which in my opinion might be easier and more cost effective to maintain but isnt appropriate for a hotel room. you can literally feel every grain of dirt and sand as you walk. now remember the shower does leak/ flood the bathroom floor so that wet floor extends all the way into your bedroom area and your feet become a mop for the dirt on the floor.i had to rinse my feet off after I had showered just to put socks on, not good.bottom line, its a nice hotel, very trendy, close to restaurants and time square even by foot.if they could fix the shower so it doesnt create a mess and add area rugs to the rooms I would give it 5 stars.","Lillington, North Carolina","daveembrync</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lillington, North Carolina</strong>",0,4.0

I told the hotel about this and they gave me some drink coupons, which was very nice. But my plans to meet my friends there got scuttled. The other ding would be on the breakfast bar which was pretty weak in terms of offering. ","Ann Arbor, Michigan","johnramesjr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ann Arbor, Michigan</strong>",42,4.0

While the staff was friendly and helpful, the room was quite small with everything seemingly in miniature. The bathroom was half of normal size with a single sink and small counter; the shower was very small and would not accommodate a large person. The desk was half of a normal size. There was a small space between the front of the bed and the wall to walk to the other side. The floor of the room was a cold tile rather than carpet, which likely has benefits in terms of cleaning. The innovative and creative lighting and decor felt very trendy and cool and I was impressed by how much they fit in such a small area. I was fine by myself but if my husband was with me, we would have been maneuvering around each other to get to the bathroom, bed, etc. I met a couple there who had also relied on Trip Advisor reviews and had the same impression. We wondered if we had each just had the bad luck of getting a postage stamp sized room but concluded that every floor and every room was the same size based on the structure of the hotel. Small rooms seem to be the trend and are fine if that's what you expect. A continental breakfast is served in the Rooftop lounge and is free if you book directly through Wyndham. I enjoyed coffee and the view although the cereals and baked goods are not what I enjoy for breakfast.Rereading this review, it sounds very negative, which was not my intention.

It's a small hotel with a small staff, yet they always were attentive and helpful.Breakfast - a selection of pastries and cereals in their penthouse lounge each morning was a great way too get the day started and I appreciated the extended service until 11am as I had a few late nights in the city.My Room - While a bit small, It had a very comfy bed and still offered just the right amount of space and with a very comfortable size bathroom. Perhaps a bit more lighting would be nice, as I often kept my blinds closed since my view was of an office building across the alley....thus their view would be of me. Next time I may request a 24th street facing room - however, it was quiet on the back side of the hotel.

Nice that it connects to the lobby and feels so open. My recomendation is the greek salad. There is also a rooftop bar called Sir Henri which is gorgeous. Its one of these speakeasy cocktail bars with great tasting cocktails. My friends and i had fun trying the different cocktails each night. The music and DJ make the place fun. A very nice crowd comes in. Great date place i think. Overall great experience and i wish more hotels would go independant and have the flair that Henri has.

It's a Wyndham masquerading as a boutique hotel, so the room has been redone to look like the Ace hotel (example: one wall looks like it's concrete that's been tagged with ""always be a poet"" but it's really wallpaper) and very dim Edison style bulbs in the room. There's LED rope lighting around the bed frame and headboard. Room is small (it's NYC, all hotel rooms are small) but since it's sparsely decorated there's enough room to move around. The shower is great. Mini bar features outrageously priced booze, snacks, and an intimacy kit with condom, lube, and vibrating ring in case you forgot stuff. But you can walk to the CVS around the corner for any of those items (okay, maybe not the ring) if you'd prefer to not pay for the convenience. All in all, they've turned a sleepy business hotel into Stuff Millenials Like, but even if you're not in the target audience you'll find the room to be comfortable.But since the Henri is trying to be Stuff Millenials Like, they have a rooftop bar with loud music at night. When I read about the bar when I booked it I thought it would be a nice quiet place to have a drink and look at the city. When we checked in on a Saturday, our room was two floors under the bar and all we could hear until the wee hours of the morning was the thumping bass of EDM. We had packed a white noise machine and had a bluetooth speaker in our suitcase, so between the machine at its loudest setting and the speaker cranked up playing a white noise app on my phone we were able to mask the thump enough to get some sleep. If you're here on a weekend, consider having something like that in your suitcase unless you're planning to be out all night. (We had a cruise to get up for in the morning, so partying like a rock star was not an option for us.)All in all, the Henri is well located and has a comfy bed. There's no breakfast offered, but there's plenty of food nearby. It's trying too hard to be hip, but if you can excuse that you can get a little sleep.","Houston, TX","Snarky</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, TX</strong>",53,3.0

I don't usually like the hustle and bustle of New York hotels and find everything about them rush rush.From the moment we checked in there was a line but immediately we were acknowledged and told we will be right with you. After a few minutes we were greeted by the front desk agent who was a lovely young woman. She told us where everything was and offered us some fruit flavored water. Nice touch because we were driving in traffic for two hours and were thirsty. After a brief explanation of where the elevators were and and how to get wifi access we went to our room. Everything about the room was perfect. It was clean and the room smelled like fresh flowers..... Not sure if they have a flower sent coming from somewhere but it was a nice touch. Overall when i want to be in midtown area again and not in the heart of the craziness I will definitely return.
