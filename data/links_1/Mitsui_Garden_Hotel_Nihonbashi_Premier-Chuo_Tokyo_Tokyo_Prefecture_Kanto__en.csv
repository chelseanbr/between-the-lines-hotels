We booked a triple room which was around 26 sqm which I suppose is a standard sized room. But due to the fact that they needed to squeeze in 3 beds, the room was pretty tight for the 3 of us. Check in was pretty smooth, the receptionist can speak a little bit of English, and even those who don't will try their best to explain things as clear as possible. Room is clean, with sufficient amenities provided. Best thing is that they provide a set of pyjamas for each guest, so for those who is staying longer stays and want to keep the luggage light, you don't need to worry about bringing pyjamas. No bathrobes, but that's not a real problem for us. One thing about the longer stay is that there is no coin operated washing machine/ dryer. So we had to bring sufficient clothes to change for our 9 days there. Hope this can improve in the future.The best thing is the public bath. Although it's ""public"", but if you go at the right hour, there is usually only 3 or 4 other people in the bath at any one time. Also was convenient for us as we didn't need to wait for the use of the room bathroom to take a bath and can just do it at the public bath which has full shower amenities, including lockers. After the bath, one can use the massage chairs for some relaxation. The hotel is directly connected to the train station of Mitsuhoshimae and Shin-Nihombashi. There is no need to come out from the station at all, but the exit is quite hidden and you may easily miss it, so we lugged our luggage up the exit staircase on the first day. Do ask the hotel staff where the exit is, for convenience. There is also a lift that is near the exit that connects to the train station. Very convenient. The station is only 2 stops fro Ginza and Tokyo Station. Very well connected. But if you like to stay in a lively area, this is not it. The streets are practically empty most of the time, espeically after sunset. There are a couple of malls nearby - Coredo, Mitsukoshi, Yuito, but they are selling more of the upmarket stuff. So if you want to have a bit of night time vibrance, you would need to take a train down to the next stops.","Singapore, Singapore","Wenglairene</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",29,4.0

We are in room 1106 (see pictures to give you an idea). Room size is not large by American standards but if you ever stayed in Manhattan - you will find the room size more than adequate and you will be amazed by the multiple small ways they utilize every little square inch of the room. There is a large bed, great shower and bathtub, separate small room with toilet. All brand new and very efficient. Complimentary water, tea and kettle in the room as well as a small fridge. Plenty of outlets both for plugs and some for USB. They give you what they call “night clothing (basically pajamas) and slippers that you wear to the public bath (more about it a bit later). Cleaning is superb, change of towels etc plus change of pajamas. Great shampoo and conditioner in large pump bottles in the room. Separate cute “living room” area which we used to plan our day and also work a bit. Now to the public bath. If you ever went to a Korean bath in the states - the public bath in this hotel is basically the locker room facilities in one of those high end NYC Korean baths. A large hot pool that can fit probably 20 people and an area with small chairs, mirrors and showers to shave, brush your teeth, wash your head etc. it’s open at 6 am. Closes during the day and than open again in the afternoon until 1 (!!!). We use it every day. Sometimes in the morning and at night. You will love how you can relax after walking all day. Food: we skipped breakfast the first day, but went the second day. The price is about $25 per person. It’s not cheap. You can find cheaper in Tokyo. But this is a 4 star hotel by local standards and its Tōkyō. The quality of food is great. I posted pictures of the buffet. Has both Japanese and western options. Juices, espresso machine, freshly made omelets , bacon, sausage etc. as well as multiple traditional Japanese options. Definitely enough to justify the price. We will probably not eat there everyday, but not because of lack of quality or price. Just because we want someVariety :) Area:12 min walk to Tokyo station Multiple subway lines within 1-5 min walk from the hotel.7/11 in the building 24/7 and a great 24/7 sushi restaurant within 15 min walking distance.

Convenient.The lobby of the hotel is in the 9th floor and to enter the rooms you need the room card. The hotel rooms are a bit bigger than the standard japanese hotel rooms. Clean and well organized. The bath resp. shower is separated from the toilet, which is good, because the shower is not the typical bath tub shower. Bath tub and shower separated but in the same room. All necessary items for daily shower and so on are available. The only thing missing is a desk. So working is a bit difficult in the rooms.The hotel employees are friendly so far we can communicate. The English of the employees is not very good. The employees in the breakfast room are not so friendly and sometimes take plates away right after you finish. A bit strange.The breakfast is not so good. Mainly Japanese food. Less international food like toast or bread. A hotel like this should have international breakfast. Instead they offer small tiny cups with some pickles or so inside. Breakfast has to be improved a lot.All in all the hotel is good for a short stay in Tokyo especially due to the close distance to the train station. Also for shopping in the Ginza area.

I booked room only and wanted a location close to Tokyo Station. It turned out to be a 15-min walk at ground level. it took longer to walk underground as there were too many distractions (food, restaurants!). The hotel is in a business area but it’s a bustling one and there’s plenty of food available nearby in all the underground basement areas of buildings and other hotels. The room was clean (except some bits of dust which was overlooked), bed was comfy, shower only, lovely coffee available in the room. Best thing for me was the blackout blind. The room stayed in darkness when it was closed so we got full nights’ sleep (good for jet lag). Since we had room only we had little interaction with staff, speaking to them only during checking in and checking out.
