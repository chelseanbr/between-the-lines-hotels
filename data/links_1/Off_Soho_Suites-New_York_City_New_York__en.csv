I came across Off Soho by chance and after reading a few reviews, decided to give them a chance. When I first arrived, I disnt know what to expect judging from the exterior, but as soon as I walked in, I really like the vibe. My room was a three room suite with hardwood floor, spacious en suite bathroom, and queen size bed. The room was exceptionally clean, the temperature perfect, and quiet other than the typical street noise. The desk manager Gabe was first rate and took vare of my every need. I will definitely stay with them again!","Ocala, Florida","ElginC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ocala, Florida</strong>",18,5.0

Reception staff are approachable and easy going. Fresh towels changed everyday, sheets changed every other day, lift landing on every floor, and coin operated washer dryer in basement. Suite room has iron and ironing board.Cons:The aircon in bedroom was very loud and noisy. One of the ceiling light metal rim fell and almost hit our head. Clothes hanger was faulty and housekeeping didn't fix it. Housekeeping kept giving us big bottles of hair conditioners and small tubes of random brand shampoos. Bathroom window had a missing window blind panel, we had to put a cereal box cover to block the opening.

Our unit was certainly not as pictured on the website or in the promotional videos. The place is old and it shows its age everywhere you look – the photos are not representative of all units!! There maybe one or a few units that have been refurbished, but we didn't stay in one; nor did we see any through open doors. Our stay started with the toilet blocking and water flooding all over the bathroom floor (and the manager left the rubber plunger with us ""just in case it happens again""!!).The front door could not be accessed with the key; the gym was ‘unavailable’; the towels are old, small and thin. The kitchen is out of the 1960’s with little amenity - the paint and veneer on the cupboards and drawers is peeling. There is no electric kettle (you have to heat a kettle on old gas stove, the ignition system of which has had it!!). We had to make up our bed when we arrived (sheets and blankets were provided). You have to fight for a tea towel. There was no plug for the kitchen sink. The TV in our room was minuscule and had no news channels programmed into it – no CNN even!! The website promotes a Limo service from JFK, but it is not organised by the management (our travel agent tried in vain to have them organise a limo - but they can't or won't) and I overheard a couple trying to organise the service back to JFK - with no success and much frustration. We could not in good faith recommend this place to anyone and would certainly never go back.On the plus side - towels were replaced daily, and the housekeeping staff were most helpful.","Sydney, Australia","connery007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",46,2.0

The rooms are clean, the beds comfortable. Stock your fridge with the basics from Wholefoods nearby.The location is brilliant, close to the true NYC feel, great restaurants, cute shops, a bit rough still. During our week visit we had our children stay at the modern CitizenM. We had more space, a kitchenette and a separate bathroom. Privacy. We are spoiled travelers but in NYC, and when there for more than 2 or 3 days, we would much rather spend our money on food, theater and the arts. Have the feeling to live in NYC and not be in all the same aquarium style high-rises. You can still have a drink on these rooftops or work in their lobbies if you like. OSS is clean and the staff suits the place excellently. Not hipsters but beautiful New Yorkers. For breakfast we found Ceci-Cela (same block literally on other side) to be one of the best options in the city. Relaxed, affordable and great quality French bakery. We were there every morning.The location is within minutes walking from essential subway lines. Grand, Bowery, Spring, Prince. You can be on Broadway or in Central Park in 15 minutes.

The windows do not filter out the noise. The room was tiny - no space for a chair or a desk, hardly space to walk around and open the suitcase. The floors are very old and the walls are thin which means that when a person next door walks around your bed shakes. Our fire alarm started beeping very loudly and intermittently at 5am, it took more than an hour and a half and four phone-calls for the (not friendly) staff at reception to respond and sort it out - they did not even apologise.

It was spacious by NYC standards but was not very nice.Fast forward to a recent visit when my friend said they had redone their rooms, so I said sure let's try it. It's in a great location, so they have that going for them.It's renovated but it's still not that nice. It's an old building and there's a bunch of problems, like slow hot water, a floor that's seen centuries of dirty feet, and bedding that came from the dollar store.But the biggest problem with our visit was the construction right outside of our window. It woke us up at precisely 7am on the first morning of our vacation, ruining the day. Now I get it, this is NYC, there's a lot of noise. I've dealt with that before. But not construction of a new building right outside our window.Off Soho Suites gets a low rating for how poorly they dealt with the situation. We asked the front desk to move rooms and were told they were entirely sold out. That may be the case, but we are asking to move rooms. Why should we have to suffer the noise when other guests that haven't arrived don't? Only two rooms per floor had windows over the construction, so we could be put into 85% of the hotel rooms and be fine. But they wouldn't move us. They only offered a more expensive room for $200 more per night. Uhh, no.So every morning we were woken up at 7am, pretty much ruining a lot of enjoyment of my time in NYC. The icing on the cake was the last day another hotel front desk clerk telling us we should have told them about the problem and they would have moved us rooms.

It's not luxurious but we didn't pay the money to stay somewhere luxurious - this is substance over style.

The hotel is clean and well-presented, especially in the communal areas. The staff are so friendly and helpful. Location is fantastic - subway lines within a couple of minutes walk and all the bars / restaurants / coffee shops you could need. The downsides were that the beds were not particularly comfortable (especially the sofa bed) and the heating in the rooms couldn't be controlled, so it was often a little too hot or a little too cold. The shower was either scalding or freezing and wouldn't stay in its stand. There was little natural light in the room, and only big main lights, no lamps. However, for the price of the room, this hotel is excellent value and ideal for a few nights stay in NYC.

For the past six years, I've visited this marvelous city at least once a year. It's an insatiable love that can never be quenched. A part of your experience here is choosing the right place to stay. I've stayed at five star hotels such as the Ritz Carlton in Battery Park and Trump Soho. Then I stumbled upon this gem 4 years ago and haven't stayed anywhere since. Off Soho Suites is my home! The treatment that I receive from Gabe, Ralph, and Will is incomparable to any hotel within the city. I'm much more than a guest, I'm family. It's astonishing that I visit once a year and they know me by name. I was able to request a room of my choice with such a great view, by simply just asking. I appreciate the fact that I will pay for my room upon check in. No payments or deposits are required up front and canceling reservations are also not a hassle.If you're ever wondering how it would be to have an apartment in the city--this is the closet experience that you will have. The rooms are quite spacious, with a separation of the bedroom and kitchen/dining area. Now, having a fully stocked kitchen with pots, utensils, coffee maker, toaster, microwave, a refrigerator and stove is a life savior in a city that can be quite expensive. Whole Foods is conveniently located around the corner. You can always buy breakfast items to whip up very quickly in the morning. I love this place and what it represents. Make sure that when you're thinking of visiting New York City, that you try this place out at least once. I guarantee that you'll fall in love with it, just as much as I have.","Miami Beach, Florida","LewandaS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami Beach, Florida</strong>",3,5.0

We stayed in room 403 and had a bedroom, living room, full kitchen and a huge bathroom. There were also two full length mirrors which was a plus for us ladies. Everything was spotless!! We were not bothered by any neighbors and did not feel unsafe outside of the building. They were kind enough to let us check in super early and there were no hassles at the desk. Our expectations were beyond met and we will absolutely stay here again! ","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","laurenmc2017</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",51,4.0

They are hard to find in NYC, and pretty expensive. I got a one bedroom suite for a fantastic rate. The hotel was easy to find. Parking wasn't very close. The person at the front desk was on the phone, which is fine, but he didn't even acknowledge me even after he hung up. We were able to get into our room right away, even though we were early for check-in, so that was nice. We entered the room into a small kitchen and eating/living area, which contained a futon. The bedroom was off that. It can have two twins or a queen( which you need to chose prior to check-in). The bath was off the kitchen area. The decor was a bit tired, and not all the outlets worked. There was no clock in the bedroom, and the location of the outlet was at the foot of the bed, which was a bit odd. There was no carpet or rugs. The kitchen didn't have much in the way of utensils, cups, etc. Wifi was good in the living area, but not very good in the bedroom. The hotel was an easy walk to the subway, and a Whole Foods too. The rate I got was 1/3 less than the usual rate, and for that I'd stay again.

The hotel is a nice and charming-with Henry Rollins and several other great artists among its guests. The hotel offers a clean one bedroom apartment unit with kitchen and good security. There is a functional fitness room in the basement along with coin-op laundry and vending machines.The beds and ample supply of linens, bathroom, kitchen, and floors were all clean. There was a futon in the unit so as to accommodate 4 people which was perfect for a family. And the staff was very professional, helpful, and courteous as well. The staff recommended parking is affordable and a short walk from the hotel. Off Soho is set between Chrystie and the Bowery in what today is called NoLita. It is a short walk from Little Italy, Chinatown, Soho, Alphabet City, and the East Village and convenient to much of Manhattan and Brooklyn via the subway or a short taxi fare. Directly surrounding the hotel are a very good ice cream parlor, coffee shops, and pubs as well as the hipster oriented shops and galleries, plus the enduring Bowery staples of restaurant supply stores. The area is no doubt changing rapidly -becoming gentrified ala the 2000s East Village. I felt a parallel universe moment seeing the Bowery this way-Hipsters replacing the junkies, hobos, giant rats, concert posters and grunge. But times change and that's alright with me. In consideration of the City's rapidly disappearing bargains and the equally rapidly disappearing mom and pop stores, greasy spoons, and bargain clothing stores --once a staple in this great city, I would highly recommend Off Soho Suites to anyone looking for a reliable clean and affordable place to stay in New York.","Boston, Massachusetts","JaseQ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",10,4.0

We booked through Expedia.Main pluses: Bed was comfortable, and the 24/7 front staff friendly and accommodating. Other pluses were adequate lighting, a shower that worked, working safe, subway about 4 blocks away, 3 blocks to Whole Foods.Otherwise it was kind of like visiting with a friend -- a bit grimy and with small things not working (e.g. broken drawer knobs, phone in bedroom). Not ""hotel spotless"". And it was priced the same as hotels. If you need a suite with kitchen (and are OK with some grubbiness) this would be a good choice.As it happened, we didn't need the kitchen but I checked it out and it seemed to all work; though pots&pans, dishes were few; and serving bowls non-existent. The room is made up and fresh towels supplied every day.It's a noisy neighborhood but we got used to that.We stayed a week but were only in the room for nights and a few afternoon rests. There were just two of us, but you could certainly fit 4 with the extra couple sleeping on the futon/couch in the sitting room.Some minuses that are important to me:In bathroom nowhere to set anything down or hang anything -- it is a big room and we brought in some chairs to serve this need. But why not supply a shelf and some hooks?Bathroom sink was tiny and as I do laundry when I travel that was awkward. Again, plenty of room for something more spacious so why not?There were only 4 hangers so bring your own.There is little space to unpack into so you kind of have to live out of your suitcase.

This place is right in Little Italy not far from Chinatown. The area seemed ok, nothing shady or bad going on. The place when you walk in looks updated. They have some modern decor to spruce the place up. I think this was a converted apartment building. The rooms are nice size, I have stayed at the W Times Square and we were in a shoe box size room.

The sofa is a futon type sofa that can flatten and be good for kids. It has all the basics and no frills! The TV was maybe 19"" flat screen in living room, nothing in bedroom but a bed, closet and alarm clock. The place was clean and I felt safe at night.

The location was great, the hotel very clean and the street noise was surprisingly low. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the noise inside the hotel. Paper thin walls and ceilings allowed us to hear every move of our neighbors - especially the guest directly above us who we imagined must have been having late night dancing lessons. If you're a heavy sleeper or hard of hearing, this place would be ideal, though. But it is true not to expect too much service - it's pretty low key, but there IS housekeeping service and the Wifi did work fine in our room. Note that the check out time is apparently 11 am, even though the outdated binder in our room stated it was at noon. I think this place would be especially good for longer stays where a kitchen is required. Due to the noise, I probably won't stay again myself, but I wouldn't not recommend it (with the noise caveat, of course).","Greensburg, PA","frieda-f</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greensburg, PA</strong>",93,3.0

The good: If you love the LES and Soho (I do), this is a great location. My wife and I stayed in a studio suite (which can accommodate up to 4), so with the kitchen and separate bedroom the stay was more like apartment than hotel living. Whole Foods is two short blocks away, making it very convenient to stock up for use of the kitchen. We booked far enough in advance to obtain a reasonable rate for this time of year.The not-so-good: You'll have to order out for service and hospitality. They were friendly enough whenever we went in and out, but whenever we had a request, we were reminded that they keep their costs down by not investing in hospitality training. We arrived shortly after 8 a.m. to check in and were immediately informed that check-in was at 3 p.m., but they could hold our bags. I asked them to please check the reservation: we had anticipated this, and had reserved an extra night, so we could have our room upon arriving after our overnight flight. They quickly recanted, but this was just the beginning of an attitude that begins with ""the customer doesn't know what he/she is doing,"" After day one, we returned to find that neither my wife, nor my card key worked. We were admonished to keep the room keys away from our credit cards. Once again, the customer is suspect; they couldn't possibly have keyed two cards incorrectly, but both my wife and I carelessly demagnetized the room cards. We were further reprimanded for leaving the privacy sign on our door all day, which prevented us from receiving towel service that day. (I was under the impression that there were no automatic services, so I didn't think to remove the sign when we left for the day.Finally, when we requested a 1 p.m. check out, we received the automatic response that they were fully booked, and that check out time is noon - and that we should be happy with that, because 11 a.m. is the customary check out time. I reminded the attendant that we paid a full extra night, in order to check in at 8 a.m., and questioned whether asking for an extra hour on a four night stay was unreasonable - but he was not impressed. However, he graciously gave us the extra hour. The bottom line:If you get a good rate and want to indulge in the fantasy of living in an apartment on the border of LES/Soho with a grumpy landlord, then this is the place to book your experience. If you expect service with a smile, then this should not be on your list of alternative abodes.I am giving them a good review, because they don't even pretend to be service oriented, so expectations should not be high.","Sausalito, California","CaptainOver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sausalito, California</strong>",15,4.0

There are also many bars up and down Rivington, the street which this hotel sits, and as we stayed there Thursday night through a Sunday, the traffic of people was often, loud and to be honest, obnoxious & rude. Our bedroom faced Rivington, so perhaps that was the issue. We had a two twin bedroom room with the small but adequate kitchen/sofa room and off of that, a bathroom. It is very nice to have a refrigerator and place to hang out and my daughter really like this aspect. However, I did not like the surroundings at all-I guess it was too ""urban"" for me, though I have spent over a decade in downtown Chicago and have never come across something quite like this. I really can't recommend this place.",south bend,"sbendpassport</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>south bend</strong>",39,2.0

There are very few suite options in New York within our budget, and Off Soho Suites is one of them. I was particularly excited about the location in a neighborhood near Chinatown and Canal Street. This provided for a more “local” New York experience in an area with lots of character and not a ton of tourists. The Grand Street and Bowery subway stations are just a short walk from the hotel.Upon arrival at Off Soho, our reservation was readily available and there was no problem checking in. The room we reserved for the weekend was a deluxe suite for four, with an extra person (we were provided with a roll-away cot). The room included a small kitchen equipped with pots, pans, cups, coffee mugs, and silverware, a bedroom with two twin beds, and a living area with a table, coffee table, and pull-out sofa. The room itself was a tight squeeze for our group and it was difficult at times to move around. However, I found it adequate for our needs. We didn’t visit New York to spend our time in the hotel room.The building was obviously older, but the room and waiting areas seemed to have been recently remodeled. The paint on the walls was clean, the floors were shiny and clean, and the bathroom was in decent shape. Overall, the condition of the room was acceptable and nothing was broken or falling apart, including in the bathroom.Sleeping in the room was a little uncomfortable. This was due in part because we had a group of people and also because the beds and the fold-out couch were somewhat uncomfortable. However, I do not consider this a negative given the price and purpose of the hotel in general. I did not find the room particularly noisy, especially for a busy city. We rarely encountered other guests and never heard any noise or commotion from other rooms or from the hallway.To wrap up, my expectations of the Suites were tempered by the fact that it was a budget hotel that is advertised as a “hotel alternative”. I was not expecting plush beds, soundproof walls, or an enormous space. As a result, I was very pleased with my experience at Off Soho Suites. The rooms were livable, the service was standard, and the location was unbeatable for a true New York experience.",North Carolina,"rowuncw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Carolina</strong>",3,3.0

I was in NYC for one night and needed somewhere to lay my head during the terrible winter storm that was approaching. I checked into a single room which actually contained two single beds (forgot to take pictures). The room I received was a room within a suite I had to share with another occupant, who I never met while there...a little weird, but I got over it...I'm a college student. The suite was big and reminiscent of a small NYC apartment also with many of the amenities of most hotels (iron, iron board, towels..). The bathroom, although shared with the other occupant, was big. The kitchen within the suite was equipped with: a large refrigerator, a toaster, a microwave, sink and drain board, plenty of cupboards, and a full use stove. The room had a small flat screen TV attached to the wall with basic cable channels. The rooms were clean and the hotel staff were friendly. So far so good, right? My only complaints were that the rooms were kind of brisk during the winter day and the blankets they provided weren't doing the trick. When I mentioned it to the front desk, I was informed the hotel used central air and the heat would come on automatically. It didn't. Secondly, it seemed like I could hear everyone's footsteps in the entire hotel against the hardwood floors while I tried to sleep. It was almost unbearable. But this is NYC, I expected a little noise. Other than that, this is a cute little place to stay when visiting the city. It's close to Chinatown, Little Italy, and subway lines. The amount I paid considering the location and service was nice as well. I could see this as a place to stay during long visits to the area because of the comfort it provides with it's apartment style rooms.

I called just to confirm instead of just booking on the site. The employee who answered swore it must have been a mistake but brought up the website to double check to see if what I saw was right. He saw the price I saw and honoured it on the 4 person suite. Automatically that swayed me into thinking this hotel had great customer service. We showed up early for check-in due to a tough drive/train ride into town and not being able to use up enough time after arriving due to really windy weather, cold, tired, and carrying a backpack. The staff didn't have a problem with us showing up 2 hours before check-in (not that I'd always suggest this though) and our room was ready. The hotel itself is compact and understandably so. I wasn't expecting wide open corridors with mile high ceilings. It was clean, fashionable, bright, and, comfortable. Upon arrival into the room it was a bit worn but large, very large actually, and well put together. One complaint is the couch/extra bed. It looks good but it is not practical or all that comfortable. Each of us had a hard time finding a comfortable position while relaxing between ventures out into the city. The bathroom, like the rest of the room was large too. The toilet warning sign means what it says. It is very low flow and don't try to flush too much TP in a sitting, give a lil and flush, and then go for another flush which kinda defeats the point of a low flow if you gotta flush a few times. The shower had great pressure and heat but both were a tad difficult to control at first. The room we had was easy to control some fresh air rather than use the AC. Overall, I think this hotel has a great location as it is close to several subway stops, many delicious restaurants, bars, and music venues. It's very close to Chinatown and Little Italy as well. I'd book here again even at a regular rate but was glad the staff gave me the rate listed on the website. That went a long way for me.

The rooms don't get throughly cleaned every day but the bins are emptied, the bathroom is cleaned and the towels are changed which is fine but a change of sheets would have been nice - although I'm sure the staff would've provided us with more if asked. I've been to New York a few times and I liked this location. It looks like there is nothing there at first sight but just go a couple streets either side and there are lots of great shops, bars and places to eat. Yes you could stay somewhere like Times Square but it's nice to be in a quieter, less hectic touristy area which prompts you to explore more of NY and it's easy to get to places like Times Square anyway.I couldn't recommend this place more.

The kitchen had 4 of everything you needed and the bathroom was clean and spacious.the only problem we encountered was the taxi drivers trying to con you do not let them sit with a map and question them if you think they are wrong. from macys it should cost approx 10$ max.

It will be simpler if I just list what our pros/cons were:1. Deluxe Suite: Nice sized bedroom with comfy bed, but the sofa bed in the living room area was NOT COMFORTABLE for adults, but would be adequate for acouple of young children. We had 4 adults/2 couples and a baby. So do not expect to have really comfortable sleeping arrangements if you are planning on having 2 adults take the bedroom and 2 take the sleeper sofa. It is only about 3 inches off of the floor when you are sleeping on it, and not easy to get out of, and just does not sleep comfortably.No airconditioning in the bedroom, just a window that opens out to a VERY VERY NOISEY court from the German restraunt next door. So if it was warm weather and one couple shut the bedroom door, you would not get the air conditioning into the bedrroom, as it is in the living room, and you would be uncomfortable. The noise down below goes until 1 or 2 am, and we heard other people mentioning the fact that the noise was an issue.2. They did give us a really nice crib for 1 yr. old baby, but if you would need that, be prepared to have to squeeze it in somewhere, because there is not much room in the bedroom and with the sofa bed out, there is not much room there, either.3. They have a ""limo"" service that is very handy and will take you anywhere you want to go with just afew minutes notice. The cost is reasonable, and during busy rush-hour traffic with a taxi meter ticking, this is probably a less-expensive way to get from Soho to Midtown.4. There is a brand new ""Whole Foods"" Super market within about 2 1/2 blocks walking distance. It was very handy. There is also a very classic NY neighborhood market 1 block over that is not always open, but open during the day for pop/soda (which Whole Foods does not sell), chips, and other things you might need.5. We had a place with our own bath (Deluxe Suite). The bath is a good size. It was a chore to get towels/washclothes for 4 people. When we asked we got them, and enough to do all of us.6. Don't expect ""maid service"". There is a charge for your room to be serviced. We were there for 4 days, made the bed up ourselves, but some sweeping/vacuuming would have been nice.7. The kitchen in the suite was great. Micorwave, full stove and fridge. Silverware, pots and pans, dishes, glasses. We cooked in the room afew times and it saved us money. All in all I would say if you can handle the noise, probably sharing a bath if you don't get a big suite, want somewhere that can get you were you want to go if you choose not to taxi or use subway, and are ready for classic NYC walking and want to be down in Soho, this would be a good place. I imagine the prices are about the same as other places, no better, no worse. It is a'place you could depend on to be clean and safe.",Ypsilanti,"TravlinGranny_7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ypsilanti</strong>",5,2.0

We knew there was a shared bath, but were not prepared, based on the descriptions, for bedding down in what was essentially a closet. After two days, we moved into the adjoining room, where we could at least access the beds without too much problem. The biggest problems we had were with the advertising of the place . Master bedroom should read master closet, remodeled means only the downstairs lounge. Wireless access means that you have to pay for it (altho there are so many unprotected wireless accounts nearby that you can probably log onto one of them). We were told that room cleaning would be $25/day extra. We had to beg for towels and soap. Someone smoked in the room next to us, and it didn't seem to concern management too much. The guys at the desk are nice, but what you are paying for here is the location. Walk out the door and you are in the middle of Soho, with restaurants every 20 feet.

I asked they guys at the front desk, and they acted surprised that I had expected shampoo. They pointed me toward a nearby drugstore.Location is great, which is the only redeeming quality.

The hotel was really more like an apartment building. We rented a room with 2 double beds in the bedroom and a futon (at least a queen, if not a king size!) in the living room. Althought it was small, it was perfect for a reasonable price.Reservations and check in were easy - I normally stick to chain hotels, so I was a bit nervous, but everything went smooth.Some things someone considering this hotel should know:1. There are 3 subway stops located close by that are very convenient, and from there you can get almost anywhere.2. There is a restaurant/bar right next door that has an outdoor seating area in the back that you may hear through your windows. In our suite, only the bedroom had an air conditioner, so those sleeping in the living room may need to open the windows, and thus will hear the bar noise. I am a very light sleeper, but I was sufficiently exhausted every night after touring Manhattan, and it didn't bother me. In the bedroom, with the air on, you can't hear it at all. I'm not sure, but I would guess those with windows facing to the front of the buiding will hear the smoker's crowd out front.3. There are laundry facilities in the basement - $2 per load, per machine. The dryers don't work well, and there is no change machine, so bring your own quarters as the front desk staff doesn't have change either. There are 3 washers (one was out of order) and two dryers.4. The neighborhood, to those who aren't familiar with NYC, may look rough - the buildings on the street and in the area are full of grafitti. I never felt unsafe at all. It may look bad, but it's really not.5. The kitchen comes equipped with a microwave, 4 burner stove/oven, fridge, dishes (plates, bowls, small glasses, coffee cups, and silverware) for 4, one pot, one pan, a tea pot, a strainer, a bottle opener/corkscrew, a large serving spoon, and a pancake turner. No towels, paper or otherwise are supplied for the kitchen. No sponge or soap for the kitchen is supplied. No coffee maker. There is only one ice tray, so we started putting the ice in the strainer to keep up with our needs - 5 people need ore than 12 pieces of ice!6. There are a number of small stores in the area for food supplies - but many of them close before 6pm.7. Maid service is available for an extra $15 (not sure if that's per day or total, since we didn't use it). The only service you will receive is fresh (very very thin and small) bath towels (no hand or face) daily, trash removal, toilet paper, and soap. The suite itself was very clean.8. There is a very nice gym, with nice equipment, but it is in the basement, so therefore not very well ventilated.9. There is also a lounge that is spacious and faces the street on the ground floor - good for people watching!10. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. They will greet you each and every time they see you, and will answer your questions. When I checked out, I mentioned that I had a great stay, except the last night there was a group of probably 8 young men who checked in and had several rooms on several floors. They were running back and forth between rooms, up and down the stairs, slamming doors and shouting. I finally went out at 3:30am after 2 hours of this and asked them to be quiet, which they did except for the door slamming thing. The guy at the front desk said all I had to do was call him and he would have taken care of it, and I believe that.So, all in all, not a Hyatt or a Sheraton, just a small apartment style hotel on the edge of SOHO, Chinatown, and Little Italy that is clean and safe, and reasonable. I am very pleased.Whoops! I forgot the most important thing - the beds! Our double beds in the the bedroom were brand new - still had the IKEA tags hanging off the frames. They were comfortable - but be aware that the AC is right next to the foot of one of them. We just directed the vent up and it wasn't a problem, and was nice white noise. The futon bed in the living room is very large, and quite firm. It was new, a leather covered two piece foam thing. One side is slightly softer than the other, and the hotel didn't seem to have a fitted sheet large enough for it, so we ended up using a flat sheet for the bottom and just pinning the sheet under the legs to hold it on. I like hard mattresses, and this one has very little give - perfect! The pillows were okay - they had some kind of covering on them that didn't let the air out of them very easily so they were overly poofy for my tastes and took a long time to smoosh down.",California,"SCashCalifornia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",68,4.0

The reservation process and checkin procedere was problem-free, staff was friendly and helpful with luggage storage and limo service after checkout.

Despite the age of the interior and furniture, everything was perfectly clean and worked properly (we didnt use the aircon).

There was a couple in front of us checking in, who were annoyed that with a 2 person suite they would have to share a bathroom with another 2 person suite, if you book the 4 person suite you don't have to share a bathroom. The suites were clean and serviced daily, the rooms were small to medium in size but I've seen much smaller in NYC, they were comfortable and it was great to have a full size fridge to use.The surrounding area was safe enough for a single female to walk around at night, there were some restaurant equipment suppliers down the road which gave it a bit of an industrial feel to the area but its perfectly safe. The subway was a couple of blocks away, the nearby restaurants and shopping on Spring St were fantastic, spend a few days exploring the area.

The first night we arrived around 8pm and were hungry - we wandered around the corner to find ourselves amongst a queue of men waiting to get into a mission for the homeless, and as two women we felt pretty vulnerable. In the day it's not far to walk to the subway or to nicer areas, but bear this in mind if you are women travelling alone.Also the beds were not great , the sofa very uncomfortable and the kitchen did not have the basics like a plug in the sink to wash any dishes. The hairdryer cuts out after 30 seconds of use!Don't be misled by their video - this is very basic accommodation and a bill of $1200 for a 4 night stay seems very high to me.

I said, ""that room should be more like $100.. he said.. THAT IS THE RATE.Checked out and went to Hotel Gansevoort . $540.. which made me want to cry.. but when I got there.. QUALITY.. just oozed of the kind of place you really want to be. Full amenities. very nice CD player with music selection in room, Large screen TV and a Bathroom that was 1st class. Very modern decor in room.. no expense spared.

The original Ray's Pizza joint is right over on Prince. It is also perched on the edge of the east Village and there are many restaurant choices on Houston (Katz's Deli a brief walk to the east) and north of Houston up 2nd Ave. I travel with a small dog and this place never bats an eye and they never charge extra for her. The immediate neighborhood is home to the restaurant supply industry, so the nightlife is not stellar right outside the front door, but there are a number of little bars and other joints that are going in there. Easy to get to the subway, and usually no problem getting a taxi in the area.The rooms have rather uncomfortable mattresses - an update is desparately needed in that area, but I loved the good kitchen (helps you save LOTS of money just eating breakfast in) and good bathroom. The room also featured a small living area with couch and satellite TV. A large closet was in the bedroon, and the room has windows that open.

If you bring earplugs (noisy waterpipes etc.) and if you intend to do your own cooking, as we did : also a few dishcloths, you will be doing fine ! The area is OK - Chinatown and whatever's left of Little Italy are just around the corner, and you can find supermarkets like Gristede's not far away.

By luck, we came across the Off-Soho Suites hotel. We stayed in a one bedroom suite which included a sofabed and kitchenette for $178 per night (plus tax brings it to over $200). Just about any other place that could comfortably accommodate the four of us would have cost easily twice as much. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating. So, what's the catch? Our room was clean when we moved in but the daily maid service didn't make up the beds, or really seem to do any cleaning apart from the bathroom. The one day our beds were made up, we were inexplicably missing a sheet and three pillowcases (the front desk promptly took care of it). Towels and sheets are threadbare, but again, clean. The hotel is surrounded by restaurant supply warehouses and the Bowery Mission (which hosted a huge Thanksgiving dinner for the indigent in a tent during our stay) is around the corner; if you're squeamish about this sort of thing, you may want to stick with a Midtown hotel, but my wife, two schoolage daughters, and I experienced zero problems, even at 10 p.m. However, a two minute walk brings you to Chinatown, Little Italy, Soho, or Nolita. Likewise, three different subway stations served by about 6 different lines are within a couple of blocks of the hotel. In summary, the place wasn't posh, but if you're willing to rough it a bit, this hotel has a great location at a great price.","Chicago, IL","GrandTour35025</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, IL</strong>",14,3.0

The suites were reconditioned apartments that were clean and well-maintained in an north-of-Chinatown neighborhood that's a little on the ""industrial"" (but not unsafe) side. Get 2 economy suites with shared bath and kitchen and you have an entire apartment for relatively cheap, which is what I did with my brother. Our parents stayed in a deluxe suite that was quite large and equally nice. The staff was friendly (well, for New Yorkers) and helped us out with ordering cars, plus the lobby featured signed testimonials by Henry Rollins, Slash's Snakepit and other musicians attributing to OffSoho's quality. The only problems we had were a lack of available washclothes on some days and, while the apartments were sizeable, the actual economy bedrooms barely held 2 twin beds and a tiny closet with the door shut. In addition, the building supply companys on the block start at 8AM each day with banging and large trucks that regularly woke up my parents. The hotel's within a 3-block walk of 3 different subway stations so it worked great as a base camp for each day of sightseeing.","Louisville, KY","eljefe883</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Louisville, KY</strong>",78,4.0

Walking distance to Soho, Greenwich Village, Little Italy, Chinatown etc. HEAPS of funky bars, cafes and shops around too. Is much less stuffy than midtown and definitely relaxed.

This time we chose to stay in the Lower East Side/Soho area. We were looking for a one bedroom unit with a kitchen, since we were taking my 17 year old son and his friend. One-bedroom units are not easy to find in NYC and if you do they are very pricey.We chose the Off-Soho Suites after an extensive search of hotels. We were nervous before we got there because there were only a few reviews and they were not that great. But we were pleasantly surprised when we arrived. First, the people who worked there were friendly and very helpful. We did not have to pay to park. That saved us $25 per day. Our room was like a furnished apartment. It was clean, well furnished, had a full kitchen with all the utensils, pots and pans, stove, refrigerator, etc. The floors were polished hardwood. Our bedroom had two single beds (which can be pushed together to make a king), but we could have had two doubles or a queen. The living room had a pull-out queen size sleeper sofa for the boys and a TV. The bathroom was large with a closet to keep things in. And we were walking distance from Soho, Little Italy, Greenwich Village, China Town, Ground Zero (long walk but worth it). It was a subway or taxi ride to Midtown, but we did not want to spend much time there this trip anyway. Taxis cost $10 per trip to Midtown. There were subway stations a couple blocks blocks away. We would definitely go back and stay at the Off-Soho Suites. It is not the big fancy expensive hotel like you find in Midtown, but it was comfortable and convenient. The air conditioning is a window unit, and you get four bath towels per room (no wash cloths or hand towels). If you don't mind that, it is definitely worth the stay. The hotel reminded us of the hotels we stayed at in Europe, in both Ireland and Germany. It is very European. There was a very good German restaurant right next door with an outdoor beer garden. We ate dinner there one night and it was delicious and relatively inexpensive. There is also a cafe in the hotel which serves food, wine and beer until midnight.We paid about $100 per night less than the other hotels we considered. Giving up central air and a wash cloth was well worth it.","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania","LM77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</strong>",49,3.0

We found the welcome friendly and our room was spacious, clean and bright. Maids cleaned everyday. The location is great for Little Italy, Soho, Chinatown, etc... all within easy walking distance. Times Square is about $7 in a Taxi though if your legs are good you could walk it! There's a little cafe in reception that you can grab a beer from, which was most welcome after our flight in. The neighbourhood is safe enough but like anywhere in NY, keep your wits about you. There is always somone on the front desk and you have to show your key to gain access at night, so it feels nice and secure. My only complaint would be the lock on the door could have been a bit stronger but we had no problems and would certainly stay again. A good hotel in a good area at a great price!
