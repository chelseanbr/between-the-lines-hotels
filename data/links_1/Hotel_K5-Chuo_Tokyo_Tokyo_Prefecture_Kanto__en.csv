The staff were very friendly, and accommodating. The rooms are all beautifully and though fully designed. The record players are a nice lo-fi touch. The pajamas are to die for! I cannot wait until they offer them for purchase. The restaurants and cafe attached are great as well. Tasty tacos, great beer and wonderful coffees. Could not recommend enough! Can’t wait to visit again!",,cornerkicker,0,5.0

We stayed at the K5 Room loft, the curtains amplified the relaxing and nighty feeling. It was so hard to get up and go out from the room! The bed was very comfortable and big. There’s so much to feel, playing our playlist through the bluetooth speakers, while reading on the red sofa or just lay back on the black chair it was a superb stay-in experience. It wasn’t just the bed and the room that welcomed us warmly, the helpful and very friendly staff did too, different from usual hotels. It was also remarkable to have different places you can hang out once you’re in the hotel. There is the Caveman that offers great pairing of wine and different ingredients put together to give out unique tastes. There is AO bar where you could quietly chill, ‘B’ the beer bar that offers the Brooklyn Brewery’s different beer, with really good tacos. Having a a cup of cafe latte in the morning from Switch coffee was also refreshing. Staying at Hotel K5 was a really amazing, I highly recommend it!

It was as if European and Japanese culture came together in one hotel. We had lots of fun at this micro-complex. We got great tacos and Brooklyn Brewery beer at the dowstairs beerhall called B. The room we stayed in had great decor and comfort with relaxing music. The front desk staff are very attentive and always kind willing to help with any questions we had. We'll hopefully back very soon.",,hir0t0shiy,0,5.0

I stayed with my girlfriend in the Junior Suite for two nights. we have a full course meal at Caveman, the main restaurant, which was amazing, especially with its organic wine pairing. Breakfast was western style only, but the variety of butter and jam with sour dough was impressive. 2nd night, we had a more casual dinner with friends over beer and tacos at ""B"" and finished it off at the hotel bar which was an interesting mixology between hard liquor and chinese? tea. the rooms had great sound system with a vinyl record player. bluetooth can also be connected.",,yuta0,0,5.0

We really enjoyed the great hospitality, the rooms, the coffee, the food and the breakfast was outstanding. The hotel is very comfortable and well-designed and we will definitely stay there again.
