I liked the convenience of the location and that there was a restaurant in the building. All the rooms have a balcony and a view of the canal. The hotel is in the heart of Waikiki. The gym is run down and needs work. The pool and hot tub is a perk and a high light. There is free parking on the street and valet at the hotel. It is hard to get the free parking on the street but its possible. ,"Queens, New York","kryssykrys</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Queens, New York</strong>",17,4.0

I am a budget traveler so finding a room in central Waikiki under $200/night is a challenge. But Sand Villa ticks all my boxes, and then some. Their pool area is nicer than many of the fancy places. Because I stayed a week I got the buffet breakfast free each morning, and free shuttle from and back to the airport (they contract with Robert's). Also free Star Advertiser (local newspaper) available in the lobby each morning. Pool/beach towels available by honor check out on the hospitality floor.The staff was amazing, in all parts of the hotel operation... front desk, bar/restaurant, maids, maintenance, everyone was welcoming and friendly. I knew from one previous stay that it can be noisy from the traffic along the Ala Wai canal, so did pay a small amount more to be up higher in the building (that's how their room categories go, on the 8th floor, and where I saw sunrise over the canal each morning. The room was perfect for me. I was solo and with a comfy king bed. Decent linens and towels. Everything kept very clean. I used the undercounter frig. There is also a coffee maker, but I just went down and had breakfast on the patio each morning.I walked around for a look/see at the other hotels that had been on my list of possibilities but none, in that price range, beat what I found at Sand Villa. They give a 10% discount coupon for return visitors with no expiration date. They will see me again the next time I'm in Waikiki.Will try to add a few photos, but the ones on their website are accurate. Feel free to PM me thru TA if you have any questions about this wonderful place to stay.",Seattle,"suze2you</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle</strong>",64,5.0

The Ala Wai canal is very walkable and just across the street. Staff is friendly and helpful. Hotel could use a bit of fresh paint. Stores and restaurants are nearby. Bus stops are conveniently a block away. There is a secluded 70' pool, nice jacuzzi, and foot spa. The hotel supplies hand soap,shampoo, and body wash from soap dispensers. Bring your own bar soap, if you are particular about your shampoo bring your own. Don't forget your conditioner. Hotel has a bar plus a restaurant.

This is an older property and a bit of a hike to the beach (10-15 minutes), about 6 minutes to the International Market Place, and various restaurants. There is a bar and grill on site with not one, but two, happy hours!. The staff is 5* friendly and helpful. There is a nice mix of locals and guests in the bar, and usually some lively conversation. I watched the Super Bowl here, and thought the drinks and food were good, especially the ahi poke bowl..My room was clean, there were two waters and two guava juices in the fridge (complimentary) and a nice two mug coffee maker and kona blend coffee. The amenities are, unfortunately, in the newly mandated bulk style. Bathroom is small but OK, no grab bar in tub. Lighting just OK. The lighting in the room itself is good, especially the sliding door to the balcony! Also bedside lamps, one over the table, and a stray floor lamp that was not plugged in that I guess you could move to where needed. There is no available outlet at the head of the bed, but a completely free four outlet fixture by the table. I had no problems with the free wifi and my phone automatically connected when I walked back to the property. I think it's a first that I only had to log on once in five days!The pool is very nice, and they have a foot spa, which I didn't use. Rumor has it there's a fitness center, and there's a self service laundry on the second floor.This room would be a definite squeeze for 4 people. Two cons: skip the breakfast buffet--it costs $12.57 and is on par with the free breakfasts that, for example, the Choice Hotel chains offer. (Instead walk to the Kona Coffee Purveyor next to the International Market Place, Kuhio Ave entrance.) Also, I never did see a towel at the pool towel dispensary box (but I didn't go ask for one either).If you're looking for upscale, a special occasion trip, or a ""heart of the action"" place, look elsewhere. As a solo traveler it fit the bill and I wouldn't hesitate to return.","Wichita, Kansas","skipaway</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wichita, Kansas</strong>",77,4.0

Pool and hot tub are available for hotel guests until 9pm, and the foot spa is open until midnight. Free breakfast is something that is almost unheard of in Waikiki, so that is an added bonus.

I would have given them a higher rating. However, we asked an employee ( a male) who appeared to be pushing a laundry cart through the lobby for directions to the double decker tour bus stop. He did not even attempt to be helpful. As we turned to get on the elevator. He turned to another male employee and referred to us by what is known a a derogatory name for tourists in Hawaiian. The tone he used and the rolling of his eyes made it clear that it was intended as an insult. He then got on the elevator with us. The term he used was 'haole'. It is a word arising from a distrust of foreigners or outsiders (a term used in Hawaii to refer to a white person.) I made a point of making sure he knew before I walked away that I knew exactly what the word meant and that he was rude and the name calling was totally inappropriate. He made no attempt to apologize. Just smirked and walked away. I will not stay here again and will not recommend this place to others. The elevators were also not working properly the day we stayed.

Big palms right outside your window. The ac works very well. Medium size fridge ,coffee maker and a Japanese Toilet. The breakfast is included if you book direct with the hotel. I would recommend that for sure they always have deals. Also the hotel has one of those smaller rental car outlets in the lobby that offer great rates . Let me tell everyone that is a big deal because rental cars are expensive in Honolulu. The hotel is in walking distance (5min) to Waikiki beach.Also lots of shopping around for food and everything else you need.

The hotel is located within walking distance of shopping, restaurants and the beach or canal. We had a nice view of the canal from our room and deck. It was convenient to have an in-room safe. We managed to enjoy the hot tub on three afternoons before they closed it off the day before we left for home. We were so looking forward to a bit of relaxation there on our last day there. We enjoyed a lunch and another day had appies/wine for an afternoon break at the Sand Bar & Grill. Service was good and food was tasty.The carpet in the hallways was in poor condition and should be removed/replaced. Room was quite small and in need of updating. Curtains were deteriorating. The beds and pillows were not comfortable. No where to place our large suitcase so we ended up placing in on the small round bistro table for easy access. Not enough lighting in the bathroom to see when trying to put on makeup. Would prefer bars of soap and small containers of shampoo and conditioner. Did not like using the shampoo or body wash dispenser. Do not use body wash and if the shampoo doesn't include conditioner, then the conditioner should be supplied for the many of us that like to use it. There was constant loud noise from the traffic down below and no soundproofing when the sliding door is closed. It was hard to relax in the room or on the deck with so much noise from the constant traffic or work going on nearby. Double glazed windows and doors might slightly help to reduce the loud volume of noise.","Summerside, Canada","Daisy052</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Summerside, Canada</strong>",52,3.0

Floors in room and hall ways need to be cleaned.(shampooed once a week) vacuumed 3 times a day) TV was small. TV was old and barely working . Bathrooms were nasty. Wall paper needed changed. Tubs need to be scrubbed . Shower was spitting out black dirt. Compared to other hotels that are 3 star this one should have not been considered a 1 star. 1 elevator working. Pool also needed to be cleaned. Hot Tub was not hot at all was lukewarm and jets barely working as well.

This is because the fair being served for lunch and dinner are hardly edible. We, (my wife and myself) gave this place our business three times and found it completely lacking.

We stayed here for 4 nights and it was not a relaxing stay. My family hated it and wanted to leave. But we stuck it out.Pros:The swimming pool is nice, large, perfect temperature, not crowded, with plants and flowers. There's enough chairs and lounges around the pool with umbrellas. It is nice to come back from a hot day and be able to swim in a relaxing pool. They have a jacuzzi. Granted that it needs to be painted (the sides look blackish, from mold?). The area around the pool needs to be maintained. There is a door, near the bathroom, that is COMPLETELY RUSTED. How is it like that? Does no one notice? The women's bathroom by the pool was out of service the whole time I was there. I doubt anyone was coming to fix it.The location of the hotel is good. Two blocks down and you are right on Waikiki beach (by the police station). Nice easy walk.We got discounted valet parking. It is narrow going up that ramp with cars parked on one side. Most of the time we did not have a problem leaving and getting our car. But one evening, there were 3 cars just parked in front of the hotel and abandoned on the ramp, and no one was tending to the valet service. I had to go to the front desk to tell them and still no valet person came. Finally someone came and he was so slow and definitely not in a hurry to move anything. My husband waited on the ramp for more than 30 minutes. Ridiculous and unprofessional!We had free breakfast there. It was okay, and free, and had consisted of yogurt, rice, miso soup, a type of meat (sausages, etc...), mixed vegetables, juice and coffee. Not bad, not great.CONS:The hotel lobby is open air and sort of busy and stressful. The elevators are awful looking - ripped carpet, just really old. We were on the 10th floor, and the hallway looked like something from an old hospital institution from the 1950s. It was scary looking, dim, and the carpet looked so stained, like from a horror movie. How can a hotel be in operation with hallways like that?? Our room was tiny, and the AC only works when you put the key in, so make sure you keep that key in there when you leave the room. Even though the AC is on, you can barely feel anything, and we had it on the lowest temperate and high speed. It just barely works. We had a corner room with sliding doors on both sides, so we opened the doors and it was hot even with trade winds. It was quite windy (but a hot windy) and very noisy below. We ultimately had to close the doors and suffered the heat in the stifling room with a barely functioning AC. the room was cramped, and the tv was small, and I think i got a renovated room but you couldn't really tell.Oh, and if you need a pool towel, good luck and go to the2nd floor which is like a scary factory with tons of workers and laundry machines. You have to go there to sign in and return the towels. They also have a hospitality ""suite"" where you can change if your flight is later. Note that you have to share this room so anyone else can be in there.No offense to this hotel but honestly, how are you still in business? Your hotel is in absolute disrepair and none of your air conditioners work. Do you not notice the problems?? We survived the hotel but would never recommend this hotel and will never be going back. the only saving grace is the nice pool. There are too many better hotels out there.

It’s close to everything. I was very happy with the location.I do not recommend this hotel when it is super hot. We were there during an unusual heat wave. Our hotel room was 80 degrees upon arrival. The air conditioner won’t work without the room key, so make sure you get at least 2. After 4 hours, it only got down to 79 degrees, so I requested another room. Others told me their air didn’t work either. We were moved to another room next day. With 4 hours to kill between rooms, we enjoyed the pool. It was very refreshing and I heard one of the biggest in the area. We didn’t need to worry about our belongings like we did at the beach.Our 2nd room got down to 74, so we were happy. Unfortunately, there was an ice machine about 20 feet away the hotel staff used to fill plastic containers all hours of the night. It seemed to go on forever, was very noisy and woke me several times.The rooms were old and outdated, but fine for the price if not for the heat. They do not clean under the beds, so don’t lose anything unless you want to fight the dust bunnies for it.They have a breakfast buffet, but for $1/per person more you can get much better around the corner at TR Fire Grill in the Hilton Garden Inn. Absolutely no comparison and your food won’t get attacked by birds when you get up to get coffee.Will I stay there again? – most likely not unless I’m on a severely strict budget.","La Center, Washington","H2HummerTime</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Center, Washington</strong>",9,3.0

The rooms are inside with air conditioning but, in true Hawaii fashion, the rest of the hotel (reception, restaurant, etc) are outside with no air conditioning.

We called the front desk to please fix the AC. First time they just adjusted from auto to fan and said fixed. It did not obviously fix the problem so we called again. They said it might be the filter but they don't have any filters. Then they said it cannot be fixed but since the hotel was booked full there is nothing they can do. So we had to put up with the hot room. The floor corridors are absolutely filthy and seems they never replaced the carpet from the 70's. Yellow and once green now grey carpeting. Horrible stains.

The hotel was extremely old and dated, which i am just mentioning though it really isn’t a main issue at all. My issue was the cleanliness of the room - the floor was filthy - my toddler was crawling around picking up previous guests hair, dirt and bits off the floor. Which was disgusting. Under the bed we found some of the previous guests belongings that had been left and the maid had not even checked under the beds to brush them/ vacuume otherwise she would of noticed - my feet were filthy black even after just getting out the shower. All the runners on the balcony doors had dirt and rubbish in them , again my toddler was picking things out. Just to mention as well That the hotel is on one of the busiest/ noisiest streets in town , cars go up and down it all night long : so don’t expect a nice relaxing nights sleep. We left way before check out after the first night and booked a different hotel for our second night - the pictures and information about the hotel isn’t very accurate. All in all We were very disappointed with our stay. On returning home we had a email off the hotel asking us if we were happy with our stay and if we were then to kindly leave them a good review on trip advisor , if we were not happy with our stay then please can we email directly to address why - when I received the email I thought ok, I’ll email them back and let them know we were really disappointed and explain why. 3 weeks on and I have had no reply to the email I sent them, so I guess their customer service isn’t that great either if they are unable to reply to my email. When it was them who emailed me in the first place asking me to rate them on trip advisor.

I came across it by reading a review just like this, so it’s great to see how on point the feedback was from other reviewers. We stayed for 8 nights and enjoyed every minute. Check-in was simple, they accepted a package for us in advance, and we were good to go. It does not boast to be overly modern, or fancy, but it’s charm lies in the quiet atmosphere and historic feel. If you’re anything like us, you’ll enjoy it there because it is appreciated by locals (the restaurant called the Loco House has been a haunt for Honolulu residents for decades). Would absolutely stay again and listed some of the top s for us below: - The Loco House - amazing happy hour, super friendly prices, awesome staff, convenient to the max. There is also complimentary breakfast (subject to the number of nights you stay)- Location - you have the ability to walk everywhere in Waikiki without the droves of people (we stepped foot into the Hilton and were beyond overwhelmed)- Lanai - we hadn’t anticipated having a balcony, but we did and had a nice view of the canal. We found ourselves having drinks and leftovers out there quite often (would ask about that as might not be a feature of all rooms) - Pool facilities - It’s a great pool and on multiple occasions when we went we had it to ourselves. Even when we didn’t it was quiet and tranquil- Laundry - it’s not sexy, but being able to do our laundry midway through the trip was really helpful - Shuttle transport - we were able to book free transport through the hotel for both legs of the trip (only eligible if you stay a certain number of nights though so check before booking)","New York City, New York","carranzaromanza</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,5.0

There were multiple ABC Stores nearby, the Waikiki Trolley hub was only a few blocks away, the beach was within a 10 min walk, and the Ala Wai Canal is across the street and so nice to walk along in the evening. There are multiple restaurants and take out food vendors nearby. Public transit is very accessible and convenient. The hotel was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. There was a mini fridge and a coffee maker in our room. The tv was a nice size, not that we used it alot. I really liked that the shower head had adjustable settings and was on a hose. The hotel could use a facelift in the hallways and guest rooms, as you could see where some doors had replacement doorknobs and were plastered, and the hallways were a bit darker, but the room was very bright and had both black out curtains and a sheer curtain, so you can block out as much of the city light as you want. I felt very safe and comfortable there. The hotel pool was a good size and clean. The hot tub and foot spa was nice too. The pool area never really seemed too busy, which I really liked. The greenery around the pool was nice also. Made it feel much more tropical than looking at the walls the the neighboring buildings.The restaurant Loco House was good. In the morning we had free buffet breakfast because we booked direct on their website. There was a decent mix of food there. The restaurant menu for the rest of the day was limited but good. The service was always good and quick and portion sizes were great. The staff was also great.Also, we got a free shuttle to and from the airport because we booked direct with the hotel, which they offer for up to 2 guests per room for 4 or more nights. There was a small car rental place in the lobby which was great. They were open until 7, and if you rent through them the hotel discounts your parking. If they are booked up, there is an Alamo around the corner also opened til about 7. Most other places close at 3. We only wanted a day rental so it was convenient to bring the vehicle back same day without paying for parking.There was a laundry room on site which is coin operated, and a hospitality room to relax after checking out our to get a shower and changing before heading to the airport. They even have pay per use massage chairs, $1 per 5 mins.In full disclosure, we were on the 7 the floor, and there was some street noise, because of the location of the hotel, mostly emergency vehicles. However, it wasn't my first time in Waikiki, and the last trip we stayed in a higher end hotel across from the beach and I found it much the same and we were on a much higher floor. So I feel like you may find that anywhere on the main drag in Waikiki.Last but certainly not least, the staff were amazing. They were so accommodating and so helpful in helping us find things and giving suggestions of things to do and see. Everyday getting us as we would come and go, and making sure everything was to our satisfaction. Overall, the price was excellent, and I would go back in a heartbeat.",,SarahNicole85,7,4.0

The menu at Loco House Restaurant was small, but food was good. You get a free breakfast when you book direct with hotel. We also received free airport shuttle by booking direct. Hotel also has laundry facility & there's a car rental right in the lobby. The room itself was visibly dated (old doors, fixtures ect) but it was Very Clean & Comfortable. You can see where there have been repairs done by the poor paint & plaster jobs. There is a fridge & coffee maker in the room, & the hotel has a hospitality room with a microwave if you wanted to heat up anything. Our flight home was in the evening, the hotel accommodated a late check out & held our bags until we were ready to leave. Also, there are showers in the hospitality room that we took advantage of, to freshen up before our flight. One issue that you may want to be aware of, is the hotel is on a corner, & there is a lot of traffic noise.Over all, If you're looking for 5 star luxury accommodations, this is not for you.

The Hospitality Room is also a really great bonus, especially if you arrive before check-in time or have to depart after the usual check-out time (11 AM). The left-luggage section is good, too. If there are any suggestions that I could give the management, they are - 1) the front desk staff (although they were totally professional and competent) could have friendlier dispositions (esp. considering that the housekeeping staff and breakfast staff were extremely friendly at all times), 2) the breakfast buffet would be better if the exact same food items were to be available from the start of the breakfast buffet service to the end of the service (on each day), and 3) the street noise was a nuisance on several nights, and if there are rooms where the noise is less, that info could maybe be mentioned to potential guests at booking time.

Dang good breakfast too. Buffet style with lots of good choices. This would easily cost $15-$20 per person at other resorts. This place also has a GREAT pool. During our stay nobody was using the pool. Why? Probably because World Famous Waikiki Beach is a 5 minute walk!!!! OMG! It's so close! If you jog it's closer. The staff here is also super super friendly. I stress this because we stopped in the Hyatt Regency right on the beach. Corporate run hotel with sadly an unfriendly staff. They did not want to be bothered by tourists. Why visitors are OK with paying $300+ per night PLUS resort fee and NO free breakfast to be treated this way was beyond us?

Juices were not fresh, but coffee was good if you could keep it hot!There was plain white bread or croissants with grape jelly.No tea available or fancy coffees that were listed nearby.The hot food consisted of scrambled eggs, breakfast sausages,Slices of some larger sausage, fried rice, and a mixed hash.Being a typical Hawaiian hotel there were nothing to stop the sparrows coming in so you had to be careful not to leave food unattended.The pool is great with shade on at least one or two side depending on the direction of the sun.Pool temperature was fine - warm enough to get in but cold enough to refresh you.The condition of the pool and surrounding area was good except the sun Loungers are from the seventies!Oddly, you have to go the hospitality level and sign for pool towels! A bit antiquated if you ask me!We were annoyed that the better coffees were not available for most of the time we would be in - before 10am and after 1pm (the barrister gone!)Customer service was mixed but generally ok.There I’d s free shuttle to the airport we found out belatedly, but it will want to pick you up 5 hours before your flight as it picks up other travellers on its way. We booked it then wanted to cancel - the hotel wanted to charge us if we cancelled the free shuttle! My advice is to pay the $23 for a service that just takes your party and will pick you up at 3hours before your flight approximately (Try Hawaii23).Checking in and out was easy.The hotel is only 5 minutes from the beach, the international shopping market, several ABC stores are closer than that, and a food pantry supermarket is also within 5 minutes.For everything else take the local buses - $5.50 for a day pass!Uber would be great for 4 or more people. Bus stop only a few minutes away.We would happily stay here again.","Christchurch, New Zealand","Nadar7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Christchurch, New Zealand</strong>",102,4.0

I called the front desk right away and asked if she can move us to a different room. She told me that they had a group in house and to check the following day as they will have available rooms to move into. We did not want to go thru the hassle of unpacking and packing again so we decided not to move. It wasn’t noisy at all (guests wise) however, when the maids are cleaning the rooms, they talk loudly to each other and it’s hard to put my toddler for a nap. 8 days into our stay we found out about their bigger units. They did not inform me about these units at check in or when I asked to be moved to a different room. I would have paid more to be upgraded. I know your property is not an extended stay hotel but if you have a guest staying more than seven days, you should up-sell. It’s a win win situation for the hotel and guests as they will pay more money to have a larger room and thats an extra revenue for the hotel. I also informed the front desk manager (forgot to get her name) about this but she did not seem to care. She checked us out at the end of our stay but did not even thank us for staying nor apologize for the inconvenience. Oh and I almost forgot to mention, you should have your elevator checked.

I have also stayed at many hotels with some that have gone and changed name and had facelifts. In that time, i have stayed at the Waikiki Sand Villa Hotel and i can say that it perfect for my needs and honestly won't stay anywhere else. I love the 10% return policy they have which helps with the cost. I have stayed as a couple, family and have also recommended to other friends who equally enjoyed their stay. The room itself (as a couple) has 2 comfortable beds, ample cupboard space, large tv, clean bathroom and a lovely verandah to sit on and enjoy a drink or two. The staff are friendly especially the valet guys or would always say hi when we walked past. The pool of course is the huge stand out and one of the best in Oahu competing with the expensive hotels. We used it everyday and also the spa and foot spa. I must say the restaurant was nicer a few years ago but that is the joy with outside contractors. I haven't eaten there since the change for dinner but did use the included breakfast. Yes that was also ordinary but you have a saving of at least $12 AUD somewhere else and at least it is something to eat. Location is also great being closed to shops, the beach, bus transportation and pretty much central to everything.Our stay was just recently from the 19th June to the 3rd July 2018.I have no hesitation in staying again which i plan in the future and always happy to recommend to others.

The hotel also says they provide breakfast you are thinking sausage/bacon eggs maybe some fruit. Well fried shrimp, chicken nuggets and potato tots were not my idea of breakfast. The fruit was not very good only cantaloupe and pineapple it left much to be desired. The juice was watered down not what we r used to. Now the room very small the view was of the canal was ok the walls are paper thin and could use updating. Housekeeping took our blankets so all we had were sheets.

It was a last minute booking for a night in Waikiki. I stumbled across the Waikiki Sand Villa Hotel. I was a bit hesitant at first but soon after contemplating booked the reservation online.As I pulled up into the hotels entrance, there was no Valet to meet me (Valet parking only). I soon unloaded and made my way to the front desk where the agent was head deep into his work and after a few minutes of waiting he acknowledged me.After checking in I finally made my way to the room. To my surprise I was very thrilled with the many “environmentally responsible” enhancements made to the room. I did not have high expectations of the rooms decor or offerings which I was okay with. I loved the water cleaning toilet seat - it evens warms! The room had some issues with the AC as it had never gotten to my ideal temperature (maintenance also came to check it out).The package that I booked came with complimentary breakfast - it was nice little buffet which I really liked.I enjoyed the foot bath it was really relaxing. The restaurant staff was super friendly accommodating my every request.The highlight of my stay was finally finding out that they offer complimentary bottle of water and can of guava juice. This little touch in the room totally made me feel special, thank you!I will defiantly return - I really felt at home!

The TV had a good variety of channels & was a decent size.I also had the buffet breakfast included in my stay to save on money.

There are also a couple of computers that you can use which I took advantage of to print out my online check-in for my return flight home that I had to change because of a death in the family. The staff were very helpful & only charged me for the week I stayed there instead of the10 days I had originally booked. They also rang & booked shuttle buses for the Swap Meet & Factory Outlets for me as well.The pool area was nice with a decent size pool for Waikiki hotel standards. I never had a problem finding an empty sunbed & it was a good place to unwind after a busy day of shopping.I didn't eat at the restaurant at the hotel as there are so many other restaurants to choose from with better ambience but it looked ok if you didn't feel like going out.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for affordable accommodation & handy location in Waikiki.","Gosford, Australia","Blondie59</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gosford, Australia</strong>",36,4.0

There is everything you need inside the hotel - pool, jacuzzi, bar&restaurant, wine bar, spa, computer room, free wifi in the entire hotel including rooms, laundromats, etc. Sign up for their newsletter and you might get free breakfast included with your stay. It's nothing fancy, but very good and varied - scrambled eggs, sausages, rice, vegetables, croissants, muffins, soup, yogurt, fruit (pineapples, melons, etc.), sometimes oatmeal, juice (4 flavors), water, coffee, tea. If you book for more than 4 nights on their website (which has better prices than most of booking websites) you get free airport shuttle, which will save you some money (usually the bus is around 15$ per person, one-way). There is no resort fee, which is also another good way to save few extra bucks (this fee is very common in Honolulu hotels and in my opinion makes no sense).Sometimes late check-out is possible (if there is nobody checking in to your room on the day you're leaving). If not they have two spare bathrooms for their guests, so you can take a shower before your flight (free of charge). They also have a storage room for your luggage if you want to go to the beach after checking out.

There was only 1 working elevator, which made it extremely inconvenient to everyone, especially guests. No one showed us where the stairs were, which might've been a faster route for some and just in case of an emergency. The first night of our stay, the AC shut off and we were told the maintenance company was already working on it the next morning and should be up and running by that afternoon. After returning from some shopping later that day, the AC was still not working. What better feeling than to come back to your room with the AC on blast after a long day of shopping? Not for us.

Waikiki is tourist expensive. We chose this hotel as we were on a business trip and the price per night was a 3rd the amount of the hotels right on the beach. At $175/N we were willing to walk the 3 blocks. Also, there is a $25/N parking fee with in/out tipping, which is pertinent to my one complaint. One morning we were delivered our car with my iPhone charging cable noticeably missing, as we always leave it plugged into the USB for navigating on the road. Just to make sure we were not mistaken in our suspicion, we checked under the seats and room, but we knew the obvious that it had been ""borrowed"". 24 hours after contacting management, I was informed by the general manager, Nancy, that they were still investigating (?). I'm not sure what they expected to uncover, but my investigation was complete and my conclusion correct. Now legally, they have no responsibility to compensate me. It was only a $3 cable, but now I have the irritation of hunting for a new one. At $25/N I don't care if it was a camera or stick of gum, I don't expect anything missing. Having been in the resort business myself for 10 years, I know that no matter how hard you try, you will always have a few rats on the payroll. To their credit, the next day they went out and got me a new iPhone charging cable (that I suggested would close the issue).Now for the good. Everyone we encountered at this property was outwardly professional, and surprisingly 5-star resort gracious and courteous. The verbiage was rehearsed-perfect. The service everywhere, from housekeeping, to bar, to restaurant, was flawless. Although the appointments of the property were not as posh and glitzy of those on the beach, the hotel was clean and manicured. One more thing: the wifi signal was free and strong throughout the entire property.

That was the case but the hotel offers complimentary to guests a room where they can freshen up (including shower, bathroom, internet access) and then leave bags. This meant that I could get changed out of my warm clothes into clothes more comfortable for the warm temperature outside and go exploring before coming back later in the day to check into my room.The hotel is nothing special to look at from the outside (think Soviet-era concrete high-rise) and the hotel is old but once in the room, it is very well appointed, the beds are comfortable and the bathroom was clean. I had a room with a balcony and view of the nearby canal and the air con was easy to control inside the room. The hotel is located close to plenty of very good dining options and is about a 10 minute walk to the beach. It's also close to the bus stop for The Bus which is cheap and easy to use and a great way to get around Waikiki in hot weather.The staff are friendly and helpful and my only complaint during my stay was a result of renovations being done to a room next door to where I was staying. I'm a night owl which means I like to sleep in but hammering outside my room started at about 9.00am which didn't make for a particularly full sleep.I had breakfast once in the restaurant - it is buffet style with a mix of hot and cold dishes, it's good value, filling and plentiful.

We don't spend much time in the room at all. Upon arrival, the room was ready. It wasn't the cleanest, but I think it was just unnoticed. By the second day, the wall was wiped down where it looked like someone had spilled something (previous to us). Bathroom and linens were clean. Pool area was clean, and nice. Front desk, and all staff including valet was friendly. The lady at the excursion desk seemed less knowledgeable than we were, and this was our first trip to the island. We were not impressed with the restaurant, or the key card to turn on lights/AC. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised!

The hotel manager worked with me and got us a great rate and even upgraded us to a king bed for our stay. This was like our honeymoon.. But 20 years later. We came here to celebrate our 20 year wedding anniversary! She had said she marked it that this was a special occasion and would do something special for us for our first visit to the island and the fact it was our anniversary. She didn't. But with that aside. Our room was up high with a great view from the balcony. Pretty standard room. Kind of small, but we weren't in it too much so that was ok. I don't like how the bathrooms are set up. There is NO counter space for anything like make up , hair stuff, toothbrushes etc. I did however enjoy that The rooms had fancy bidet toilets. Lol. The heat in Hawaii is HOT AND Humid! So we were bothered the rooms never got below 78-79 in the days but at night it was fine. They need signage at this hotel BAD! We had to call down to find out where ice machines were or vending machines (which they didn't have?!?) they had one soda machine with warm bottles of soda for $2. The restaurant in here called Wood and Bucket has a small menu but good food. You CANNOT order it from your room and go pick it up which was a big disappointment!! Or no room service:( The pool was great! Beautiful. Quiet. Biggest one in Honolulu!... But to get to it you have to walk through that fancy restaurant that is in the hotel! That is awkward and I didn't like that at all. Plus is closes at 9pm , which is when people would like to swim and unwind after a long day of heat while touring the island. Most others (we looked) closed between 10pm-midnight! They do have valet parking which was great and our valet Joel was wonderful and we left him a tip at the end of the week! There is said to be a ""continental breakfast "" in their website video, but we found this isn't true unless you are in an upgraded room. So it the will cost $14 a person. I did complain about this as we were in an upgraded room so they did go ahead and give us vouchers for breakfast the rest of our stay. This needs to be more clear on their videos. People watch these when making decisions and then they aren't true. Not cool. Also, we had requested a smoking room (bad habit I know!) and didn't get one. Which we wouldn't of smoked IN the room, but on the balcony. But doing this (on balcony) got us a ""warning"" for smoking in room!! We never smoke in any rooms , our house, car, etc. we took this ""warning"" and talked to the front desk and I guess no matter what you can't smoke outside?! Well It didn't state that ANYWHERE! Then like 3 days in to our stay (after complaining) we found a nice smoking area?! Why wouldn't they of told us about this? But.. All in all for the price and location it was a nice place to stay. Not sure I would stay again if we ever visit the island in the future. Too much confusion and miscommunications in my opinion. We ended up checking out early and stayed with our friends who are locals the last 3 days we were there. ",,Trail578412,4,3.0

I was advised I could use the Hospitality room to get sorted and I could make use of the pool and towels etc. My suitcase would be stored securely until I needed it. I recovered my pool gear from by suitcase, picked up a free newspaper and got some towels from the ample supply by the pool and made myself comfortable till my room was available at 3 pm. The pool area is extremely nice and shade and deck chairs are available. Bathrooms and showers are adjacent to the pool and the Wood and Bucket bar will deliver drinks poolside once you order at the bar.As promised my room was ready at 3pm. If you book through the hotels website you will obtain several advantages. On standard rooms you will get a free airport shuttle (To and from the airport), free hotel safe in your room and free local calls. On deluxe and above rooms a free breakfast is included for every day of your stay for up to two persons. free Wi Fi is also available throughout the hotel, rooms and pool areaMy room was a standard rate one but on the 11th floor. It was very tidy and had a nice balcony with table and two seats. There was room to dry small items of clothing (bring a stretchy line)A reasonably large fridge –freezer was supplied which accommodated large bottles and cans of drink. Bottled water (the tap water is chlorinated) was available nearby for 99c per 1.5 liter.The linen on the beds was of good quality and pillows and bed comfortable. A hairdryer was also provided along with a bidet on the toilet. Shampoo in dispensers was provided in the combined full size bath/shower unit. Hot water at very good pressure was always available. The central air conditioner worked well, had an individual thermostat in the room and did a good job of keeping the room comfortable. Ample clothes storage and drawers were also available. The door was strong and the locks secure. Access was by way of magnetic swipe card key and the safe had a conventional key.A coffee maker and coffee bags were provided daily and on request a Hotpot (kettle or jug) was also provided as I prefer tea. 2 x ceramic cups were also provided.The daily maid service was friendly and did a very good job of maintaining the room and changing towels etc. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly at this hotel. I was never pushed to leave the room for the maids as I have experienced at other hotels. The maids here work around your schedule, not theirs. Excellent! There is an excellent Supermarket called the Food Pantry within 2 minutes of the hotel (walk across the road and diagonally through the car park on leaving the hotel and you will be there! Take a reusable cloth bag with you as the bags in Hawaii are paper only. You will find all you need there including ready to eat meals. There is also an ABC convenience store 2 minutes’ walk from the hotel if you turn hard left on leaving the hotel. I use both to purchase water, food, beer, soft drink, bread fruit etc, very convenient.The beach is about 8 minutes relaxed walking from the hotel with plenty to see on the way. If you are fit you can walk to Ala Moana along the canal which is the coolest way to walk. Turn hard right on leaving the hotel, cross the road to the canal and turn left away from Diamond Head to walk to Ala Moana. Plenty of free maps available on the sidewalk. Some of the walk is in the sun so wear a hat and sun is under shade trees along the canal (allow 40 minutes).There are plenty of places to eat and they are not all that expensive. Use Trip Advisor for recommendations. Check my reviews to assist here. Some are very close to the hotel and some 15 minutes’ walk away like the Shorebird Beach Broiler, my personal favorite!This hotel just keeps getting better, it’s not the Hilton but it punches way above its weight!

So important on our budget!- Within walking distance of the beach.- We had a gorgeous view from our 8th floor balcony facing Diamond Head!- Very friendly and seemingly responsible valet! They made a huge difference! - Foot spa! Why aren't other hotels investing in this?- Gorgeous pool! Too die for beauty out there with the flora and lighted pool. - Visited the glorious hot tub every day and almost every night!- Housekeeping staff is on it! Always a clean room and they changed the sheets everyday! Never had a hotel do that before! - Daytime bartender was so helpful. We ordered food but the hubby was still a little seasick so she was happy to box it up for us and even gave him a free ginger ale. Talk about feeling cared for! - Room was cozy with a great balcony.- On site laundry facilities but I think it should be made free to guests.- They have a designated smoking area that faces those luscious green mountains!- The bidet was very neat!Fails:- Hot tub & pool close at 9pm. Absolutely devastating after all the sightseeing and you just want to relax.- Pool towels didn't seem to be stocked throughout the day, especially in the evening.- The big guy at the front desk...bad attitude all the way around. He was not friendly at all and seemed annoyed every time we had a question or concern. I don't remember him smiling once. - No one bothered to explain to us about where the smoking area was, where the pool was, the pool/hot tub hours, parking policies/charges, special perks like the coupons for the restaurant, no mention at all of the Hospitality Floor, how to turn on the power in our room, we were never told about the spa in the hotel and I would've gone if I knew (I just found out tonight after reading another review). We had to find out everything on our own. That wouldn't bother me but it kinda made us feel like ""stupid tourists"".- Night time bartender could be a little more friendlier and a little less annoyed. She was smiling at all the single young men but seemed irritated at everyone else. She also can't make a martini...word of advice: the vermouth isn't poured into the martini, it's just used to swish in the glass before the martini is poured in. - Hotel is a bit dated. - It was very awkward to have to walk through the restaurant and bar to get to and from the pool. I'm sure people didn't want to see us parading through there in our wet bathing suits. Especially when there were no pool towels available.- The full size beds were a tight fit for our honeymoon.- Water pressure in the shower was lacking.- I had to beat the tar out of the light switches to get them to switch on and off.I did put more cons than pros but my overall opinion is that it was a very decent stay for the money. Will we stay here again? It's a definite possibility purely based on how much my pro list meant to me.",Pecos,"TKM61716</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pecos</strong>",2,4.0

We had a room with 2 beds and a great view of the river off ala wai. We liked the check in process and the valet was great. We did have to pay to valet the car each night but it was affordable in comparison to other hotels. Also, the location was great, and we could walk to most places. The staff was really friendly as well. The food downstairs was not bad either. We tried the breakfast buffet and had dinner at wood and bucket and both were good. Remember to bring your coupons, and you can get 15% off each time. Also, the pool and jacuzzi were awesome! The downsides of this hotel are that it's a little bit older and is showing its age a little. The bathroom was decent but could've been bigger and the shower didn't have the best water pressure. Also, the beds were a little stiff and hard to sleep in. But the part that was the most frustrating was how the power worked in the room. You have to use the room key and sometimes this caused a lot of issues. Also, the AC didn't really cool down the room and each time we wanted to turn the bathroom light on and off we had to pound it really hard or else it wouldn't work.

And boy did I feel bad as I always knew what to expect with the Hilton and this one here was a big unknown.Reasons that justified the switch instantly: - Saving over 50% in room rates compared to the HHV- Complimentary airport pick-up and drop-off (another $50 saving)When I arrived, check-in was easy and to my surprise I even got free vouchers for the hot breakfast buffet because I had booked a whole week in a certain room category. Awesome!But... I needed to adjust my attitude as the WSV is not the HHV and things are a little simpler. So here my list of pro's and con's:Pro:- The price- No resort fee - Rooms have hardwood floors, so much cleaner than yucky hotel carpets- The pool (size and hardly ever anyone there)- Heated toilet seats :)- Convenient location- Free hot breakfast buffet if you book a certain category/length of stay- Friendly staff- Free WiFi and actually great reception all over the place- Free airport shuttle if you book a certain length of stay- Great securityRoom for improvement:- No cleaning wipes at the gym for guests to clean up after themselves- Corner rooms' balcony doors are not fit to handle the wind, they keep banging against the frame (I had to switch rooms because of that)- Hallways would look so much better with just a fresh coat of paint- Drapes could use some love = a round in the washer- No real milk/cream for coffee/tea at the breakfast buffetOverall the WSV is a very solid option if you don't want to spend your vacation budget on a hotel room.","Vancouver, Canada","bubbelbine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",124,4.0

As this price can differ substantially from hotel to hotel, it's certainly a bonus that you aren't paying additional money to stay here. On Ala Wai Boulevard, the Hotel is a 5-10 minute walk to the beach, and to all the sights on the Waikiki strip. If you're situated at the back of the hotel, it's certainly a lot quieter than it is at the front, so make sure you're asking to be put at the back for some peace and quiet. The rooms are very small - there's no space for chairs and lounges in the double bed rooms, so it's not particularly well set out for families. I wouldn't see any more than 2 adults fitting into these rooms and even then it's not exactly comfortable. The Hotel is in the process of updating the rooms - so if you get a refurbished one I'm sure your experience will be a lot better - I was in one that has yet to be refurbished and it was looking it's age. There were cosmetic issues in the room (peeling paint etc) but it was clean and neat. The mattresses were a bit of an issue, as they were so old and worn out that they sagged dramatically in the middle - but a quick chat to reception got this fixed up straight away for us. The Valet service for car parking is great - no need to worry about where to park when you go out (and parking at most hotels in the area usually requires you to get back before 5-6 to guarantee a parking position) and so it's so much easier to let the valet look after that for you. There's a tv, a refrigerator and wifi that will hopefully work for you. We had mixed reliability with the wifi - sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. If you're out and about for the whole day and you're coming back to sleep, the Waikiki Sand Villa is a great option.

WORST hotel 1st impression of my life. First off we booked a queen room and ended up in a room with 2 double beds. Mind you i am very pregnant it was a very tight fit. Next the washroom was Filthy HAIRS and left over SOAP all over like it wasn't even cleaned after the last guest. So dirty I felt like showering in my shoes. Next one of the beds were covered in stains not sure if the sheets were changed. It was very disappointing walking into this hotel after seeing such nice photos and pretty good reviews. The photos are OLD this hotel seems run down really needs a reno. My husbands biggest complaint is there is ZERO control over the thermostat main reason is it will only run while the key card is placed in the room wall unit that supplies power to the room, also all lights are turned on when power in being fed to the room with no light switches to turn them off. When you sleep the key comes out to turn lights off. This was leaving our room either too hot or too cold because as soon as we leave the thermostat turns off.

Pool towels are provided. There is a bar near the pool area. You have to walk through the restaurant to get to the foot spa or the pool area though. The rooms are basic but we stayed in a room with two double beds with three of us and it was quite comfortable. With four people its a bit of juggling with suitcases. Small area to hang clothes but chest of 6 big drawers. TV. Coffee maker, ironing board and iron. No kettle. Would have preferred a kettle to a coffee maker. There is a hospitality room on one of the floor where you can use the microwave if you need to heat something or need to wait till your room is ready or even freshen up after you check out if you still have to stay for the day. It has a bathroom, loungers, computers. The rooms have free wifi and worked quite well. Shower gel and shampoo, hand wash. No shower caps and toiletries so you need to bring your own. Has a bar fridge. Bus stop is close to the hotel to catch buses to just about everywhere. Fares were $2.50 a ride (1.25 for under 18's)and if you need to transfer buses, you can do so on the same ticket, so long as you use it within two hours. There is a supermarket across the road open till 1am and lots of restaurants, nightclubs and shops nearby as well as McDonalds if you pine for fast food. We went January and had temperature around 27 degrees celsius. Water was cool to get in but warm once you were in and there was no lack of people swimming. Warm enough to walk around in summer clothes, swimmers etc. Doesn't cool off till late night and still only need something light. Showers are very good. Great water pressure. Very nice and helpful staff. We stayed on the 12th floor and overlooked the canal. There is a golf course on the opposite side of the canal. If you follow the canal you actually walk to Ala Moana shopping centre but it can take up to an hour, depending how fast or slow you walk. We did get noise from constant sirens going down the road and if you leave the balcony door open it gets a bit noisy but it didn't bother us at all.

With the hotel having free wifi, that certainly was a big plus as a traveller to not have to mess around getting that sorted. The only drawback is the 2 lifts they have are incredibly slow and we were worried that using the fire stairs would set off the alarm so made for a bit of a wait at times.

Definitely more of a ""budget"" hotel, but if you're planning on spending most of your time out of the hotel on the beach or sightseeing, it has everything you need.Pros:- Location is only 2 1/2 blocks away from the wide stretch of public beach at Waikiki. Really can't beat that, unless you're in one of the really expensive hotels ON the beach. Also, there's even an ABC store half-way to the beach to stop an pick up snacks, sunscreen, etc. - Beds were surprisingly comfortable! I struggle with insomnia and once I got used to the noise (see cons), the last three nights I was there were some of the best nights of sleep I've had in years!- Helpful and friendly staff.- This one is random, but on top of a pool and a hot tub (neither of which I used so I can't speak to them), there is also a foot spa, which is basically a hot tub but just for your feet. It is located on the outdoor patio of the restaurant. My boyfriend and I had gone on a long hike one day and checked out the foot spa to help our aching feet and it was so nice that we went down to use the foot spa on all subsequent nights.Cons:- Other than just generally not being as elegant as some hotels, with older fixtures, carpet etc., the worst part was the noise, particularly in the early mornings (starting around 6 am) when it seemed like there were always garbage trucks or construction of some kind going on. I was on the Kanekapolei Street side on the 9th floor but it really sounded like the trucks were right outside my window. Now, as I mentioned before, I suffer regularly from insomnia, so I am a lighter sleeper than some; however, that also means I already wear ear plugs to sleep every night and the sounds of the trucks still woke me up the first few mornings. However, the second half of my trip, I switched to the bed further from the window, went to bed earlier (and was pretty tired from hiking, surfing, etc), and I slept great the last few nights, so who knows!","San Francisco, California","Julie L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",25,4.0

You are 3 (small) blocks from the beach, less than a 10 min stroll. There is an ABC store on the corner and lots of supermarkets nearby. The hotel is right by the canal which I could see from my room with a great view over downtown Honolulu. I arrived early in the morning and couldn't get into my room unfortunately but there is a hospitality room with full bathrooms so I could shower after a long flight. All rooms have balconies. The pool is really nice - large and not on a roof so sheltered from the wind! The foot spa is also really nice and relaxing. Staff were pleasant.Bad bits: The bathrooms are dated and mine had terrible water pressure on the 8th floor. The breakfast is disgusting. Do not pay for it!!!!!!!!! It caters for the many Japanese tourists with a selection of noodles and veges (not my thing) but the rest is dismal. A few fruits, some french toast with unidentified sauce, dry scrambled eggs, tea only available on request and no fresh milk. Only that dreadful American flavoured creamer.

Friendly, helpful, and sure, although you would expect that in Hawaii, no matter where you are staying, the staff here was also patient with children and elderly patrons. Nice to see and experience.The pool was the best we've had the pleasure to use. A Hottub, solar-powered Japanese foot pool, the whole lanai and pool area is clean, nicely designed and... I really enjoyed discovering the gecko family making their lives on the pool island. Sweet!Some of you would have experienced the ""usual"" when trying out a hotel-based restaurant. However, the tapas-style food, presentation and quality of the Wood and Bucket was a *huge* surprise. Complete with a couple of complimentary discount coupons as hotel guests, it was worth trying out. We liked the food so much we ate there for dinner four nights in a row.

Perfect place to rewind when not at the beach or off exploring Oahu.2. The restaurant is really quite good. Too often, hotel restaurants aren't that special, but there's something going on in the kitchen here and each meal I ate was superb.3. The rooms have been recently refreshed and mine was airy, clean and had two small balconies. Loved the beds - very fresh and comfortable.

Just ten minutes walk from the main beach and a block from the grocery store.The only real hiccup is that my new iPhone wouldn't connect to the free WiFi and the wired ethernet connection went down a couple of times.

The staff are super friendly. The best was being able to use the guest room for late night flights- we checked out at 11am, stored our luggage at the hotel, went back to the hotel 6pm to lay by the pool and used the guest room to shower and relax before heading to the airport.

My aunt and cousin were joining us the next day and got upgrade to the same floor as us so they would be close. Best service in the restaurant, taste food.

Service was great, seats a bit hard but tolerable. - Chose this hotel for it's value and proximity to transport, Waikiki beach and shops.All buses to Ala Moana, Pearl Harbour, Waikele Premium Outlets, Kahala shopping Mall, Diamod Head etc left from Kuhio Ave down the street from this hotel.- Had 2 connecting rooms 901 & 911 on the second floor (smoking floor).but there was no smell of smoke in the hallways. Both rooms were very clean each with 2 very comfortable double beds. had A/C's TV's, fridges, excellent WI FI reception (free), balconies and the rooms were attended to daily. The staff were very attentive, kind, well mannered and we can't thank them enough.The hospitality room with computers, TV and microwave and the laundry room next door were a blessing.The hotel arranged for our free transport from / to Airport.Did not get a chance to use the pool or visit the bar/grill restaurant. but had a walk through and all looked good. - We quite liked the Hawaiian themed décor of the rooms and our only suggestion would be to have smaller chest of drawers in the rooms so as to allow more room for suitcases, save the money spent on fancy Bidet / Toilet seats and spend it on re-carpeting the hallways and install better lighting in the bathrooms. - The International Market Place due to open in 2016 is on Kushio St, but for the meantime there is a narrow alley way next door with plenty of stands selling Hawaiian T-shirts, dresses etc. - ABC stores ( bread, milk, drinks, snacks, toiletries), and the Food Pantry were only a 2 minute walk away. - Ross For Less on Seaside Ave a 5 minute walk (open till 1.00 A.M !) a great place to shop for clothes, shoes some household goods etc. We found more here than all of Ala Moana and the Outlet ( daughter found a magnificent evening gown, several day dresses, tops, Guess shoes very very cheap. Son found a Nike Sports jacket , some fancy shirts, and several items for 'mates'- Going to Waikele , catch the new ""E"" bus (instead of No 42,) change to No 433 at the Waipahu transit centre ( this will save you more than an hour of travel). Make sure you tell the ""E"" bus driver you are going to Waikele to get the one ticket for both buses .Found quite a few 'brand ' name items at reasonable prices here. Son and husband found football and basketball shoes at Sports Authority and a designer watch all at good prices..McDonalds is across the road as is a great Party Shop.- Going to Pearl Harbour (plenty of reviews on this site) we joined a tour group which finished the tour early in the afternoon and instead of returning to Waikiki with the tour bus we caught the bus from the highway across the road from Pearl Harbour to Pearl Ridge Shopping Mall .This place is in two sections (Uptown and Downtown) There is a monorail $1.00 each way from inside the shopping centre that travels between the two sections. We found quite a few things here at very good prices.- Visited the Flee Market on Sunday held at Aloha Stadium. Total waste of time. Hundreds of identical stands selling exactly the same Hawaiian T-shirts and very little else. Had a massive headache from seeing the same things for over 2 hours of walking (only did half the stadium and gave up !) AND had to endure the family's ire for having dragged them out there !- Went to Paradise Cove (pre-arranged from Sydney) on New Year's Eve, had a great time, well worth seeing, were seated on the side tables, great view of the stage, good company and the activities before the show were great too. We got back in plenty of time to rest a bit at the Hotel and head to Waikiki Beach for fireworks display.- Went to Ala Moana a few times (plenty of other reviews on this site) . Walk straight through the food court, out on Keeamoku St, where you'll find Nordstrom, Wal-Mart and another Ross across the road.- Husband and son caught the No 19 bus to Toy Lynx on Iwileii Road to purchase some ""rare"" Yu-Gi-Oh cards ! while daughter and I caught the No 22 bus, drove past Diamond Head and went to Kahala Shopping Mall. which had quite a few nice dress shops and eateries.- As for Waikiki beach, it is a 'paradise' for swimming, sunbaking or simply walking around at any time of day or night, plenty of eateries and expensive boutiques open till late. Denny's nearby has the most scrumptious milk shakes. The Cheese Cake Factory has great food ( Don't spend hours in the queue, ask to be seated at the bar area (even with Children) and you will be served straight away. We also ate at the Atlantis Restaurant which had great service and wonderful food.- Hawaiian hospitality was evident everywhere we visited, such kind and happy people.","Sydney, Australia","Linda K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",33,4.0

They did mix up reservations and I had to deal with management to show I did have reservations when their computer system showed I didn't. It wasn't a big deal, but I would have rather have slept than deal with it. I would stay there again when in Waikiki.Pros: Great neighborhood. Everything (resturants, bars and beach) is within walking distance to the hotel.It has its own bar with food options. Many people staying at area hotels walk over because their hotel didn't have one.The hotel was clean overall.Cons: No street parking. Valet was available, though, for a daily rate of $20 with in and outs welcome.You had to have your hotel key inserted into the wall for electricty.

We were only a short stroll to catch a trolley to Ala Moana Shopping Centre, you can pay on board ($2) the (Pink Line) trolley. Just don't ask the lady at the hotel (on the tour desk), for a trolley map, she refused to give us one unless we purchased our tickets from her. The maps are available free on board the trolleys and from most hotels and various locations in Waikiki. The hotel advertises free breakfast, however, it wasn't free (it was approx. $12 p/p and not worth it), we found a great little breakfast at 'Cheeseburger', hash brown, two eggs, toast and coffee for $6.The room was EXTREMELY compact, two double beds (2 adults, 1 child) and no room to swing a cat. The pool was quite a nice area and pleasant enough to relax with a cool drink, as was the bar. Laundry facilities are available to do your own washing/drying on level 2 ($2 washer, $1.50 dryer).

I was a bit apprehensive about location being further than beach facing resorts, but the walk was brief and quite enjoyable lined with small shops and tropical plants, whereas a big resort would probably make us walk the same distance through it anyway. Also the food store and bus stops are only block away, so very convenient location for a budget (for Waikiki) price. I booked the reservation on hotel personal website, so that way I got the early-bird discount and also got the shuttle to and from airport for free. The size and the room décor were very comfortable with very functional lighting options. The mini refrigerator was quite big with a freezer and a vegetable tray – very useful for longer stays. The table is a good size for two people to have a meal inside, but we did wish for a second chair (seating on the bed is not very comfortable). The hotel’s restaurant offers buffet breakfast, but we did not try it (the $12 is quite pricey for my budget), but I used the coupons (given at check-in) for a couple of dinners (the food was ok). The staff was always friendly and willing to be helpful. The room was cleaned daily. The beach towels “rental” was very convenient, as well as hospitality room with computers, MW and the showers (for late check-out option). I had to leave AC on during the night since it was too hot to open the balcony doors (also I could smell tobacco from the lower levels). The shower head and the mattress were good (for me), but I brought my own soap bar, since they only offer liquids (dispensers attached to the wall).

We wanted somewhere that wasn't going to cost an arm and a leg but be close enough for us to walk around Waikiki. We didn't know what to expect on arrival but were pleasantly surprised. We had opted to stay in one of their villas at the back of the hotel beside the pool. Dbl/dbl with a kitchenette, spacious with a couch too. We were on the second level and had a nice view of the pool. However underneath our room - which we would have appreciated someone telling us, was a bar open from 6 til 2 am. This can get LOUD! I made a complaint the first night. The room was clean and everyday after house keeping were great. The pool was a great draw for us since we are traveling with our three year old, however in saying that the pool isn't very deep - if my memory serves me well it was only 5ft at its deepest, so not so great for us. Since we had a kitchenette we only had breakfast in the hotel once, and we didn't rate it highly, but there are plenty of other options close by. There is only valet parking, no other options, most of the time they are quick and friendly but there was times when they were very slow, you feel like you need to rush in and out of your car too as it is only a single lane driveway. Within walking distance there was a little market with heaps of local fresh fruit and home baked food, very delicious! There was also a restaurant down one block that did an all you can eat buffet dinner with a show for a very reasonable price! Reception were very friendly and helpful but the lady at the tour desk when i called and asked about 4th of July fireworks could tell me nothing.The hotel is undergoing renovations in the lobby which was a bit messy but it has already enhanced the entry of the hotel greatly.

This time, instead of staying in the tower we chose to stay in the villa (with a kitchen). We were there for 9 nights - and for 10 days we felt like this really was our home. We have a 3 and 5 year old, and I'm 6 months pregnant, so we needed the space and the villa studio suites provided us with that along with the great poolside location (which we didn't seem to use at all when we stayed in the towers strangely enough!). I'll try to keep things simple and tell you the good.Pros: - spacious room- great friendly staff, especially front desk for being so accommodating with our stroller storage (no elevators in the villa with their 2/3 floor studios).- relaxing pool and hot tub environment, with tables so you can dine outside with take out or your own cooked meal if you feel like having a night in- very affordable compared to other hotels with the same features (kitchen)- central location to all the shops and bus routes (Kuhio Ave), and only 3 blocks up from the beach. - just a comfortable stay after long days out and in the sun (the couch was always nice to just sit on - speaking as a very pregnant lady)The Cons (not that these are a huge deal, and certainly we would not make a huge stink over):- being on the 2nd floor, the 3rd floor above us would wake up at 6am to what would seem like rearranging their furniture. We told the front desk that they could probably solve all the noise by putting padding on the table and chair legs so that could reduce any of the noise- all the cutlery and kitchen basics were not consistent between rooms (i had a cutting board, 2 forks, 3 bowls... etc, while our friends had a spatula, no cutting board.) I'm sure if I told front desk about this they would resolve it, but because we had friends in another studio we would just borrow from each other for the meals we needed those items for. All in all we really enjoyed our stay here, it's not a Hilton or Embassy Suite, but if you're a family on a budget and want something comfortable, I would highly recommend checking out a studio suite at the Waikiki Sand Villa. We do a lot of traveling as a family, and this was one of the few times that we were really sad to have to leave - and a lot of it had to do with the fact that the Villa felt like a home for us.","Vancouver, Canada","mrs_lo3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",13,5.0

The first time I stayed here I stayed one night in every class of room to get a feel for what I wanted. To me the best value is the corner room with a view of the Golf Course and Diamond Head. For the price you will not find anything better in Waikiki. Everywhere in Waikiki has crazy parking fees as of late and everyone has also jumped on the band wagon with huge amenity fees, which really don't add anything to your trip but an additional expense. WSV doesn't have amenity fees, which is great and a little trick about the parking....book your room directly with their website and parking is 1/2 off making it just10 bucks a night. Seriously it will be money well saved that you can spend at the bar! Location is very good for walking to the beach or to all of the shopping areas. Great noodle shop near by is Mira Ka Me Udon...Cheap and delicious and a must. Staff was always very friendly and valet is prompt. Rooms are not luxurious, but very clean and perfect since you will be at the beach most the time anyway. This hotel offers value to someone who wants to get out and do things but isn't so much interested in 500 Thread Count Egyptian Cotton pillow cases and sheets. If you want that type of service you will need the Hilton. I will always come back here ....they give you a bonus 10%off coupon for your next stay when you check in.

Based on the rate you can expect okay but not great and this is what you get. The hotel is a few blocks back from the beach but not so far that it is a chore to walk there and the main shopping area is equally close. I had anticipated that for the price the place would be a lot less accessible so the location was a pleasant surprise. There is a spacious open lobby and the reception staff were pleasant and helpful. My room was on the 6th floor and had 2 double beds which was overkill for 1 person. Fewer beds and more open space would have been welcome. With a very large unit that held the TV, fridge and storage space and a desk and chair, there was very little free floor space. The room had a fairly large balcony which helped a bit. There was a coffee maker but only the first filter pack is free. Any additional packs cost $1 each at the front desk which seemed reasonable. The bathroom was small but clean and the towels were replaced each day. The toilet had one of those weird multi-function Japanese seats with a control panel and far too many options. A heated toilet seat seemed a little too much in tropical Hawaii and I opted to turn it off. There was free in-room wifi that worked well until a power cut one night which did enough damage to the system to have it down overnight and part of the next morning. These things happen and it was clearly not the hotel's fault. They had a service person there most of the night and again the next morning trying to sort it out - and eventually he did.The lobby restaurant has a buffet breakfast which costs about $12. It is similar to the free breakfasts that you get in many US 2nd tier chain hotels and you are better off eating elsewhere. A couple of times I walked to Cheeseburger Waikiki which is a fair hike away (maybe 30 minutes) but worth it for the good breakfast food and the lovely, motherly waitresses. I had dinner at the bar in the lobby restaurant one night and it was significantly better than the breakfast.Overall, the Waikiki Sand Villa provides a level of service and facilities that is probably a bit above what you should expect for the very reasonable tariff. If you go there with suitable expectations you won't be disappointed.","New York City, New York","Jane E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",226,3.0

We stayed here in early August 2013, after staying at the White Sands Hotel in Waikiki and then going on a cruise around the islands, and we were very happy that we only booked it for one night before we flew back home. It was about $120 for the night; the White Sands was about $150 and I thought from the reviews that this would be a good option to save us a bit of money, but in the end I wish we would have just stuck with the White Sands.I think we got the ""Premium"" room. Our view was a bit of the Ala Wai canal and mostly the run-down street that the hotel is on and the wall on each side of our balcony. I suppose if you get the rooms that face the canal it would be nicer. I did ask for a room with a view of the canal, but again, it was mostly a view of a wall. Bathroom was filthy. Slept on top of the sheets for fear of finding something worse in the bed.The location is alright, close to Waikiki Beach. I suppose the pool area looks nice, and there is a jacuzzi as well, but we saw dead roaches on the ground when we were leaving the pool. Staff was neither friendly nor helpful. I noticed they were more friendly and helpful to the Japanese tourists staying there. Sorry that we weren't Japanese, and for having standards.Much better for anyone who does have standards to stay at a place like the White Sands Hotel, very warm friendly atmosphere there, unlike the cold businesslike feel here.

A budget option for Waikiki, but the service is not so good. Expect a lot of oriental tourists that are frequently not polite. I`ll leave some specific comments in this review, but I would stay there again despite the not so good facts of the place.Location: the best of the hotel, in 3 blocks you`ll be in Waikiki Beach. ABC store at the same block and fast food options are near. It is in front of Ala Wai Canal, a great place for walking or running. Room: spacious, with 2 twin beds (comfortable!). we had a room at the 6th floor and had great views to the Ala Wai Canal from our balcony (and we got the cheapest room!). About the service room, sometimes it was done just in the afternoon… But the room was clean and the towels were changed every day. Wi-fi is average, you have to digit the password every time you want to use on iPhone. Bathroom is big, shower is nice. Sleep quality was ok, we could hear the traffic from the avenue, but it was not something that disturbed us. There is a coffee maker at the room, but coffee it is not replaced (you have to ask the reception for more coffee and they charge you for it).Parking: there's no parking lot, but there's a valet. Forget about trying to park on the street: the spaces are always full, it's almost impossible to park in this area. We just rented a car because we prefer to make our own tours. Remember to book the valet at the check-in, they give you 50% discount. The problem is that the valet people are rude sometimes, and just give the keys to you get the car by yourself. The good part is that you save the tip when it happens. One time we had to get the car by ourselves and our car was blocked by an employee SUV. I just didn't complained with the staff about that because we didn't have any bookings for that day, but it was too bad. Breakfast: definitely, not ok, I recommend you to buy your on things and avoid the mess. You`ll have 2, 3 or 4 slices of toast with butter and strawberry jam, coffee and canned pineapple, just that. Long lines of people that don't speak english form before the beginning of the distribution (it starts at 6:30am) and there's just a few tables. I thought it could start at least 30 min earlier, since some pick up tours are early in the morning (for Pearl Harbor, for example).","Porto Alegre, Brazil","Poly_grr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Porto Alegre, Brazil</strong>",79,4.0

The hotel had a good many japanese guests who never smiled and bumbed into us several times without excusing themselves, rather rude I must say. Waikki beach was on the other side of the island so we did not see much sand or beach, we had to walk 10 minutes to experience this.

I chose this hotel because I was planning on spending more time outside of my room than in but still wanted everyone to have an actually bed to sleep in. I had looked at a few other options (condos, etc..) but for the cost per day to be a bit higher when compared to renting 2 adjoining rooms from this location. With some of the other reviews of this place I was a bit unsure when I travel with my family the key issue is how clean the room is. With that being said, the rooms we stayed in were on the 8th floor and, were clean and, in decent repair. There were a lot of signs that this place is older your typical mildew in the shower area, and a bit of mold on the celling. The same type of items you would expect to find in a low budget clean hotel. This to me was not a deal breaker, and could easily be over looked due to the age of the Hotel. One of the things I liked was the fact that our room had hardwood / Pergo type floors and they looked great. The beds were comfortable, 2 twin beds per room. The linins were clean and appeared to be well laundered. The cooling system for the room worked as long as the room key was in the switch. We only stayed on the 8th floor (took their buy early special) but the view was still nice. Of course that is assuming you’re not looking down. The apartments nearby are a real dump. The staffs at the hotel were good but a bit on the serious side. They do have a type of breakfast every morning, but you should not expect anything more than some toast and coffee/pineapple juice. I’m very serious do not book this place thinking they will feed you breakfast, they won’t. What they offer is more of a snack to get you going till you can have a real meal. This place really caters to the Asia tourist. Almost everything is multi language, when it comes to signs. They had a towel loner program so you could check a towel out and take it to the beach with you. The beach was well within walking distance. I walked there with my 2 children (ages 7 and 12) in about 5 min. If any couples have younger children rest assured knowing that the walk is short enough that there should not be a problem. So my overall take. If your comfortable staying in a budget hotel (think 15 year old days inn) Then you will have no problems what so ever in this place. If you are bothered by little things then you may want to look elsewhere. Now for some of the things I did not like about the hotel. The only parking is Valet and there were times I was stuck waiting for them to get my car. There is so much within walking distance to the hotel that I only had to pull it out when we were traveling around the island. If you book directly with the hotel they will give you a discount on parking, otherwise it is expensive. You can google their website for more info. If I were to go back to Oahu I would stay here again without hesitation.","San Antonio, Texas","tpolston</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio, Texas</strong>",19,3.0

However, past that was a nice view of a lake. If I needed to save money, I'd stay at this hotel again. It was a short walk to the beach and right in the heart of all the other activities. My room had a twin bed and a full size bed. The room seemed dated, but clean. The room next to ours had two twin beds and a full size. This would be nice for a couple with two children.

This was the cheapest place we could find in Waikiki that seemed reasonably nice. We were extremely disappointed with this hotel. Firstly, we thought we booked a room in the Waikiki Sand Villa Hotel, but our room was in a completely different hotel altogether across the road and it didn't seem very nice.. Talk about shady. The guy at check-in was rude and arrogant as well. The room wasn't very nice and we felt dirty being in it. But we were tired and had no other choice. The only positive thing about this hotel is the location and the girl behind the bar was nice.

Bathroom was ok too, even had one of those geeky japanese toilets with buttons and all.Free WiFi was available!Location was PERFECT, you are in 5min walking distance to Waikiki-Beach and 3 minutes walking distance to Kalakau, the main street in Waikiki! Hotel is directly at the Canal, so NOT in frontline beachside ... but I thinks that's one more advantage, not that much noise and tourists. But as I said: 5min by foot and your right at the Duke statue at the Beach.ABC-Store (where you can get ANYTHING) is 1 minute away!The even had a pool, which I didn't use ... because I'm on Hawaii, I use the ocean.The staff was VERY friendly and helpful.The breakfast was a little ""basic"" (you had to choose between 2, 3 or 4 slices of toastbread, a croissant and that was it), additionally you could get yourself free coffee and OJ.If you're planning to do a budget-trip to Waikiki and wanna be near the center and in walking distance: Choose Waikiki Sand Villa Hotel!I give it 5 stars because: if I ever will be back in Honolulu, I will choose this hotel again, without ever thinking about it!

We did not eat the breakfast, which the hotel could do without, but plenty of people did take advantage of the free toast, croissant and pineapple. We did the $3 breakfast deal at the Subway just down the street. In past trips to Oahu, we walked to this hotel because we love their restaurant! Their teriyaki chicken, sizzling steak platter, island catch and nachos with kalua pork are heavenly!! We sat in the hot tub several evenings due to the cool tradewind breezes we had. It felt great! The pool area is nice, the walk is close to everything and not too far from the beach. We booked through the hotel and would stay here again if the price was right. The only problem we encountered was that we requested a king bed. The hotel responded to us before we arrived stating that they would try to accommodate us but that did not happen. My husband and I shared a full sized bed! We had two full sized beds but it ended up working out. We used the other bed to put our stuff (: Besides, we were never in our room for more than an hour after we woke up or an hour before we went to sleep! So, it worked. Decent place at a decent price. One thing I will say though, is that it is too bad there is a really sketchy apartment building right next door with a woman who tries to guilt you into not being ""green"" if you don't rent an electric scooter from her! She was kinda scary. It's too bad that place can't be demolished! I bet the hotel doesn't like it there, either!

Valet parking, so you don't have to worry about the sometimes non-existent parking elsewhere -- never had to wait more than 2 minutes for our rental car. We paid an average of $175/night including ALL taxes & fees -- excellent value. The hotel itself is just what we look for -- helpful staff, clean, good location, good water pressure, free wifi, free breakfast. And about the breakfast -- other reviewers complain about it, but we found it more than adequate to start off the day. Unlimited coffee 6:30-9:00am, 4 pieces toast, a croissant, a cup of pineapple chunks -- pretty much all we needed. Our kitchenette studio had a fridge & microwave, which we always appreciate -- we like to stock up on our own sodas & snacks. Beds were just fine, pillows were a bit flat but not unworkable, bathroom served its purpose & was clean, good water pressure (very important to us!), tv had the usual assortment of basic channels (but c'mon, you're in Hawaii, who watches much tv?). We overlooked the pool area, so didn't have any noise issues. Location can't be beat for the price -- an easy 3-block walk to Kalakaua Blvd, the main drag that parallels Waikiki Beach. AND there was direct access to the beach right at the end of the street, which is a huge plus -- you can sometimes walk for blocks before finding a way to actually get TO the beach! Numerous touristy stores, ABC stores, mini-marts all within a few blocks for you shoppers. Also a McDonald's and a Burger King along the strip. The tour desk is right in the hotel lobby -- we booked a whale-watching excursion and were pleased with the operator's knowledge and recommendations. Another big plus -- a separate business center with 7 free computers and a pay printer (10 cents/copy). Very handy to check email and print off boarding passes.

I lost my valet parking ticket the first night and all I got from him was a bunch of insults and patronising behaviour because of that when I wanted to retrieve my car.The 2nd night I was coming back walking from dinner with a friend and when requested my car to get some luggage out of it, I was insulted again by MR. DEL RIO who even ask us to check out of the Hotel, insulted us in the middle of the lobby and even call us drunk! (Last time I checked it was not illegal to have a glass of wine while dining).His behaviour and customer service can only be described as primitive and arrogant. He even said he was the Hotel Manager. Clearly that's why he works in the Valet Parking.By the way, you have to pay $20 daily extra from your room rate, to have your car mandatory in the Valet Parking as the hotel does not have private parking. On top of that, you get treated like this!To make things worst, the actual Hotel Manager never responded personally to my complaint.I requested to speak to him (his name is Sheldon Yoshida) and all he did was leaving messages with the front desk for me to write a letter. Last day he was even at the hotel and said he was going to a meeting.Once I came back to London, I wrote to the board of Directors and Yoshida replied saying he analysed the situation and he couldn’t find any wrongdoings.I am not going to bother you with more details.

They were prompt in parking/retrieving the car for us, so no complaints there.We had a free breakfast included in the booking so went down to the dining area to discover our choice of 2, 3, or 4 pieces of tiny bread toasted for us, and a few grape jelly packets. We don't eat grape jelly (horrid stuff!) so they managed to rustle up a couple of strawberry jam packets instead. We also received a small glass of watered-down pineapple juice and a small cup of tinned pineapple. We think they were draining the pineapple syrup from the tins into the beverage dispenser, then topping it up with water. In any event, it was pathetic and ought to be culled immediately.

But the very best thing of all is the ""Hospitality Room."" This is a room with computers, two full baths, and a couple of small couches which you can access all day and night after you check out at no charge. That way you can check out and store your bags, go to the beach, go out to supper, and still come back and shower and change into your travel clothes for the night flight back to the US. It's wonderful not to be wandering the streets hotel-less on your last day, or have to pay for another full night's stay. And the bell captain was very easy-going about letting us get into our bags over and over during the day. It was a priceless convenience which outweighs all of the negatives I'm about to list!Negatives -- The circle drive comes right to the edge of the narrow lobby with the two elevators so close it almost feels like you're in a parking garage rather than a hotel lobby. The hotel is a 1960s concrete block with cottage-cheese textured ceilings and a horrible avacado green/mustard yellow paint job in the hallways. Our room had a musty, unused smell, but thankfully we were able to open the door to the tiny balcony and air it out in just one evening. I've never given two thoughts to thread counts on sheets before, but these sheets were so thin they should have been turned in to rags long ago. I thought toast and coffee/tea was adequate to start the day, but it was absolutely tacky to have a roll of industrial paper towels sitting on the counter that you had to tear off a sheet to use as a napkin. Not regular paper towels, mind you, but industrial brown paper with no perforations you had to grab with two hands and rip. Seriously? You can't afford napkins. That really bothered me.All in all, it was fine if you are only staying for a few days and just want a place to shower and sleep. If you want anything more, pay the extra $20/night for the Ohana East or $40/night for the Sheraton Princess, both on the same street as this hotel.",Colorado,"wrinkledpassport</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colorado</strong>",112,3.0

Parking is valet, with good service, and they never ran out of space (unlike some of their local competitors).Be sure to try the restaurant. They serve very good food at some of the most reasonable prices in Waikiki.The only real down side was the ""free breakfast"".

So never did need to make coffee in the room.Only big issue I had was noise, no sound proof whatsoever. Lucky we had quiet neighbours for the most part, loudest noise was babies crying, loud pple walking past the door.

I've been to Waikiki a few times previously for this sort of short break. I'm not inclined to drop a lot of money on something on the beach. Other trips, other destinations, perhaps, but not Waikiki.The hotel is fine, but a bit rough around the edges. The room (premium corner category) is basic: hardwood floors (sensible) a queen sized bed, night tables, dresser, and a tiny desk and tinier wall mounted TV. Bathroom is small, with a tub that my 1,67m/5'6"" frame can just stretch out in. Balcony is a wrap-around with partial beach and canal views. Wiki Wiki breakfast is a joke: toast, juice and a shooter glass of tinned pineapple. Staff are pleasant, but when we enquired about a late check-out for Monday (which we are willing to pay for), they said ""we're sold out Monday night"". Just got back to my room and could book the room on their site or Booking.com, with the latter 25$ cheaper for the night.Compared to similar hotels of this standard, there are better options.

The Sand Villa was perfect for our budget conscious vacation. The staff was awesome, especially Pili, she was so friendly and assisted us when one of our shuttles failed to show up, thank you Pili. Our room was on the 10th floor in the front (I had requested the back) however it was fine and didn't bother to request a change. The view of the canal, golf course and mountains was perfect. It was only a 5 minute walk to the beach and all the action. Down the street was a great farmer's market, perfect for a quick snack, which we probably would not have known about staying somewhere else.The Wiki breakfast was just fair. 1-4 pcs of toast, 1 croissant and some canned pineapple. We picked up some bagels and cream cheese at the nearby food pantry.The pool area is very pretty with lots of plants, a nice place to have breakfast.The room was just what was needed, very clean, 2 double beds, dresser, desk, fridge, a safe and a balcony. The floors were laminate wood which I think is much cleaner than carpeting.The only issue we had was one of our tours got switched to the morning of our last day and I wanted to extend our check-out time. When I asked they said I would have to wait until the last day to see if it was possible. Not knowing before meant we had to pack up everything the night before just in case they said no, they ended up letting us stay until 12 instead of 11.We also took advantage of the Hospitality room, our flight was not until 11:30 pm. We were able to spend the day at the beach and come back to have a shower before we left. Having that room available was great.Overall, we had a great vacation and I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are on a budget.","Richmond Hill, Canada","Witz17</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond Hill, Canada</strong>",24,4.0

I landed at Honolulu Airport at 10pm and the free prearranged (by the hotel) Minivan collected me and after a 30 minute trip was at the hotel.Arrival:The reception staff were friendly and helpful and updated me on the changes to the Air Conditioning System and Lighting since I last stayed one year previously. Breakfast vouchers were supplied and a code given for the free wireless internet. A key for the free room safe was also supplied along with two room swipe cards.To receive these benefits it pays to book directly with the hotel through their website rather than a third party provider. If you have any issues with the online booking (in my instance booking for over two weeks at a special rate was not possible online) send reservations an email as they are very helpful and you will receive friendly personalised service.The Room:The room was a nice corner unit with two opening sliding doors onto a corner Lanai with a table and two chairs. The view was of the Golf Course, Ala Wai Canal and Diamond Head.The room was clean and tidy and came with a double and single bed. The bathroom was supplied with a washlet on the toilet and the bath was supplied with overhead removable hand shower. Soap and shampoo were via dispensers adjacent to the hand basin and in the shower/bath area.The rooms Central Air-Conditioning worked well and had a digital display showing desired temperature and current room temperature. The noise from this unit when running was not obtrusive. A coffee machine was supplied along with two porcelain cups and a starter pack or coffee with utensils. The fridge was of a good size and accommodated half gallon size milk container and had an icemaker. An Insulated ice bucket is provided and ice machines are available on alternate floors.Breakfast:The breakfast is basic but free with your vouchers. Expect Toast (1 to 4 slices as requested), Butter, Jam (Jelly) Pineapple pieces, Pineapple juice, Croissant and Coffee and Tea. Milk is of the powder variety so I suggest you purchase this and bring your own to breakfast. You can eat your breakfast poolside which is a great environment or in the bar area if this is your preference.Pool and Spa:The Pool and Spa area is large for a Waikiki Hotel and is one of the nicest ones I have seen in Waikiki in the under $300 a night hotel range. The pool is 70ft long with a good shallow end suitable for children with wide steps. An island on one side provides a jet stream to swim against for some variety. Loungers are provided and tables with shade umbrellas surround the pool. The Spa is very hot and appears well maintained. The pool is open late which is great for a refreshing swim post tour or shopping. Toilets and showers are adjacent to the pool and a gymnasium is also present. (see reception for access key).Bar service is available poolside if requested and prices are very reasonable.You are welcome to consume your own drinks poolside but sensibly no glass is allowed. The pool area is checked by security every 30 minutes or so though things tend to be calm and safe at The Sand Villa.Security: In regard to security it seems well monitored as I left my door propped open on its lock for 10 minutes one evening and a security person was soon on hand advising me to secure my door. Safes are provided in the rooms and the locks and doors are well constructed. There are security cameras poolside, in elevators (lifts) and other key areas around the hotel.Waikiki is generally a safe destination and the area accessing the hotel and nearby streets are well lit and seem safe. Of course don’t go wandering down backstreets at night or into parks. Stick to the main streets and the beach area and shops.Shopping:There are numerous food outlets nearby including a small supermarket called Food Pantry with 150ft (50 Metres). Here you will pay tourist prices. A much more economical choice(with great variety) for the reasonably fit is the Safeway Supermarket on Kapahula Ave . Just walk along the canal toward Diamond Head till it ends at Kapahula Ave and turn left walking along past the Golf Course till you reach the Supermarket on you left (you can’t miss it, just stay on Kapahula) 1.3miles (26 minutes’ walk).Ask for a Safeway card and they will sign you up straight away for discounted products.Macys Department Stores also offer a discount of 15% off most items. Show them your hotel room key/card and they will give you a 2 week discount card.Checkout Ross Dress for Less stores for general clothing, Forever 21 for the younger set is very reasonable. Sports Authority near Ward Warehouse (Ward Avenue) is the place for Sports Shoes and clothing. Famous Footwear (on the Cnr of Kamakee adjacent to Ward Warehouse) has a good range of shoes at discounted prices including Timberland and Nike.Dining out:So many places, checkout “The Shorebird” for its great all you can eat salad bar and beachside location (use the voucher in “This Week Mag” available on any street). Cha Cha Cha Mexican on Seaside Ave for outdoor seating and good food at cheap prices.Conclusion:The Waikiki Sand Villa keeps getting better and for an economical stay in a great location is unbeatable in my opinion.

I never went down for breakfast (I don't get up for breakfast @ any hotel-I'm on holidays), but ate lunch and dinner at the restaurant numerous times. The staff at the bar were all friendly and provided great service and every item I ate from the menu was well cooked and of great quality.As a single female traveller I felt safe at this hotel and walked the streets at the early hours. All the rooms I stayed in were clean and provided all the facilities I required. Great value and I will be staying at the Sand Villa on every return trip to Oahu.

Odd part is having to insert your room key into this thing in your room for the electricity to turn on. Also, they seem to have an arrangement with a few of the other local budget hotels. If you book here, you might not actually be staying here. One group ended up being across the street and another group was a couple blocks over.

The room itself a standard hotel room – clean, comfortable with usual necessity. It is about 5 mins walk to the shopping area and 10-15 mins walk to Waikiki beach. The one I like the most about this hotel is that it provides beach towel – so we just grab the towels from the laundry place and no need to worry about having no towel for showering at night after a day at the beach since we used the towel from the hotel’s bathroom! Staffs are hit and miss, some staffs are very friendly to us – but some are quite rude as well. So, depend on your luck really.. The “free“ breakfast was rubbish though. At the end we never used our coupons for breakfast – we just ate breakfast out….And... the area itself quite dodgy. Every time we passed the apartment next to the hotel on our way to the shops, EVERYDAY we smell weed. Plus my partner actually saw a girl sitting outside casually rolling one. Another 2 blocks from the hotel (where the shops/supermarkets are) there are A LOT of prostitutes on the street. My friends got asked couple of times on different nights whether he's ""free to play"". Mind you, we walked around the area every day for a week – and it was all good, no troubles or anything..

There is absolutely nothing to say negatively about the hotel other than possible noise from outside traffic. Just ask for a room higher in the hotel. The hotel is within a 5 minute walk to the beach. On that walk you pass the two main streets for restaurants and stores. You are right next to everything. The rooms were OK. I don't really like tile floors and the room was pretty plain with no frills. Nice corner balcony with views of the Canal and city.

We were travelling with an infant and 4 year old, so things were a little cramped with a playpen, strollers, etc. We saw a sign at the front desk to upgrade to a suite for $30 extra a night, which we were able to get into after the 4th night. I believe it is the same price as you would pay online. The first room was much cleaner, but the extra space in the suite was nice. As there was a kitchenette, there were some food stains, etc. on the walls and just not as clean as you would like it to be. All of the suites overlook the pool. We were on the third floor (there are only three floors in that building), but there is no elevator for the suites--we left our stroller at the bottom of the stairs out of the way when we had to be upstairs, and it worked very well. Because we booked online we also got free shuttle service to and from the airport, which was great, although we had to pay for the third person ($10 I think). All in all, it was alright. My 4 year old LOVED the pool, although it wasn't heated and he could only stand at the one end by the stairs. The pool area was great--very clean. We only had breakfast once at the hotel, we had read the reviews before, and knew we weren't missing out on anything, but normally we just have toast for breakfast anyhow, so not a major deal. There is an AWESOME noodle house a block or so away--can't remember the name, but for $5.00 you can have a great meal--there is always a line, but it moves very quickly. We ate there three times in three days. Overall, the hotel is a fine deal, but would have liked the cleaners to do a bit better job in the rooms--especially places like walls, etc. Great location.

I assume the last room was one of the best they had, since it was a corner room on the top floor, but was no more then an average room in any other hotel. Even if you exclude questionable maid service, the hotel is obviously still poorly managed. The beds are more of a cot with thin, lumpy mattresses but the toilets are high tech electronically controlled thrones out of place in such a scruffy hotel.

I heard one of the valet guys commenting about someone - '10 dollars for 5 days - what a cheap guy!' Quite rude behavior - to say the least! Also the space for pulling up into the valet must have been designed by a sadist as almost every time there is no room and you often get yelled at by airport shuttle drivers dropping off people.

First trips were in 2006 and 2007. We chose this hotel because of the cheap fares, the location (canal view but from a walking distance to Waikiki beach), the free wi-fi internet and the breakfast included in the price.In February 2012, we came back at this hotel, this time with our daughter. The hotel has barely changed (some renovations) but some changes disappointed us. First, the breakfast. They gave us 7 coupons to get a free breakfast. Now, you don't help yourself as in the past, you have to wait in line in a narrow space to receive toasts, butter and an awful and dry croissant. And worst, canned pineapples! In Hawaii, yes...I guess the coupons thing was to avoid people from outside the hotel to get free breakfasts, but it's annoying to be a guest and be served like in a cafeteria. You want another breakfast, you need another coupon. I disliked that.Otherwise, this hotel is still ok. The pool is nice, the spa too (but too warm, I haven't seen anyone who was able to stay in the water more than 10 min). One more thing I dislike: you need a key to go to the fitness room. No, your room key won't work, you need another one. When you ask for the key, it works for a day only, if you want to go back to workout, you need to reactivate the key at the front desk. The staff is nice, nothing wrong to say. The rooms are OK, no more carpet (yeah!) so more cleanliness I guess. But look, the air filter in the bathroom was DIRTY. The humidity will stick in the bathroom. I mean, I don't really mind as it's not my property, but all of the humidity goes inside the walls so sooner or later, Waikiki Sand Villa is gonna have serious problems to face.We like the restaurant bar at this hotel, food and drinks are good, decent prices...but LOOK CLOSELY AT YOUR BILL. We have been served by a lady named TAMMY, she wasn't nice to us, asked us for ID's and even asked us for our date of birth to make sure the id's were ours (even if we were obviously in our 30's with a 4 year old girl) and later she came back with the bill (with no pen to sign the receipt) she added 20% for her tips...!! Hey, I'm the one who decide how much I give based on your service and it's certainly doesn't worth 20%! She received 12% only because of her bad attitude. But the second time we came to eat there we got served by a very nice lady so I guess we weren't lucky the first time. Of course, this nice waitress got a good tip.I would still recommend this hotel if you are on a budget, don't mind to be in a modest hotel and planned to go outdoor all day to enjoy Hawaii.","Montreal, Canada","NoukyMontreal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",7,3.0

Room rate $$$$ for what you get was not good slept in 30.00 places and had a cleaner room, 1 Double Queen Room, 2 towels 1 wash cloth and 1 hand towel, Sheets are Flat and Not Fitted, Vinyl on the mattresses that are hard as a rock and pillows are hard and flat. TV was small and signal was poor, Internet speed is slow and always disconnects you. AC would only bring the room to about 72 degrees. Breakfast is a joke Toast, Coffee, and Juice.

The five minute walk to the beach was pleasant and the hotel hot tub was warm.We couldn't ask for more. One unpleasant thing happened outside the hotel on the street to an older gentleman pulling his small luggage (on its' rollers). A young jerk on a bicycle came up from behind and ripped the luggage from the man and kept on going. We couldn't catch up to the thief as he just sped up pulling the luggage along.

Most days we swam at the beach but a few times we tried the pool (also clean) but could never get a lounge chair (people seem to save their spot with a towel and then disappear for a few hours...)

We chose the upgrade studio because we wanted to be able to eat in some of the time. The studios are all situated so they over look the beautifully landscaped pool. We had an end unit with windows in 3 directions, so could look out to the hillside as well as pool. Lovely natural light. In the evening there was some of the best lighting we have had in a room ever. We like to read, and could easily do this either in bed, on the sofa, or at the kitchen table. The kitchenette was poorly supplied with one butter knife, 2 small serated knives, one fry pan and one large sauce pan, and no dish clothes or towels (we used the bathroom's). It did however have a toaster which was great for reheating the toast that is supplied for the minimal breakfast they serve. We did find that the place could have been cleaner, and we did wash the dishes, cutlery and pans prior to using them. The only other unpleasant feature is that the mattresses had plasticised protectors. Since we understand that hotels have to be careful about bed bugs these days, we understood why they did this, but it does make for less pleasant sleeping. The staff were cheerful and able to answer all questions. They sent a doorman up to the computer room to help us when I needed to print something, and couldn't figure out how to do this. I concur with all other reviews about the wonderful locale. We walked everywhere we wanted to go in Waikiki.

It was only a 5 minute walk to the beach and 20 minute walk to the zoo. The rooms were clean. The breakfast was adequate - seeing that it was free. You could have up to 4 pieces of toast, a croissant, a small pineapple cup, a glass of pineapple juice and coffee or tea. We would go down and get a tray and take our breakfast back to our room and sit on the lanai and watch the goings on down on the Ala Wai Blvd. Then we would head out for the day. Late afternoon at the pool was a welcome place from the heat and it was never crowded. Sometimes we were the only ones there.I think for the price that you pay, this hotel was a great deal. The staff were very friendly and helped with anything you asked for. They went out of their way to help us when our airport shuttle bus was delayed, making phone calls to find out where they were and when they would be at the hotel to pick us up.

After many days of research and reading on TA and elsewhere, we chose the Sand Villa hotel and we are happy we did.Location: Well located to get in or out of Waikiki, near The bus stops, a grocery store, 8 minutes walk to the beach, walking distance of everywhere in Waikiki, we even walk to Diamond Head and Ala Moana Shopping Center. Check-in/check-out: Check-in was easy so was the check out. Our departure was on a 11pm flight so we were able to store our luggage in their locked facilities to enjoy our last day in Waikiki. We also use the hospitality room to refresh before leaving to the airport. Nice touches!Staff: Everyone (valet, receptionist, housekeepers, barmaid, etc.) we met during our stay was smiling, friendly, willing to help, and made our stay even more enjoyable. Room: We were staying in room facing Diamond Head on the 8th floor. The view was beautiful and I woke up each morning at 6:30am to look the sunrise on the large balcony. Room was clean enough on arrival (could have been cleaner) and refresh during our stay (quick quick refresh). Bed were good and I didn't mind the plastic cover. The room was quiet during our stay and we didn't hear our neighbours. We needed a room to sleep and we slept well (I am a light sleeper).Amenities: The A/C was working fine but each time the fan was kicking in it made some noise but nothing to wake us up. The fridge and the in-room safe were very handy. Free wi-fi in the room and around the hotel was a definite plus. Breakfast: It has been said over and over, the breakfast is nothing special (2-3 or 4 slice of bread). But, on a tight budget (and good luck with that in Waikiki), it can make you save a few buck daily. We took the breakfast almost every morning, but we went to the Food pantry and got strong coffee, fruits and cheese to add a little twist to it.Pool: Nice pool (4foot deep) and neat Jacuzzi. Seemed well maintained. Everything closes at 9pm. Bar: Ok place to hang out and ok food (I had some sushi). It is crowded during happy hour (cheap beer) and much less afterward. Overall, reading lots of reviews, we knew what to expect choosing the Sand Villa and we're glad we did. For the price we've paid, it fulfilled our exceptions and I would go back again.","Montreal, Canada","LilyCan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",35,4.0

This hotel is value hotel compared to others in Waikiki. We checked in knowing we were getting a good deal on the rate and not expecting much in return. Location- It is located along the Ala Wai but only 2 blocks from the beach. It is also in the middle of Waikiki, very central if you want to walk around day or night. Room- We stayed in the older section because we booked on hotels.com. Our room was on the 11th floor and we had 2 lanais. They gave us 2 double beds but we pushed them together for a nice big king. There was a mini fridge and a desk. We had a nice mountain/ Ala Wai/ Sunrise view. The bathroom was small but decent. For the low rate of the room, it was basically what we were expecting. The room was clean and maids were nice.Valet- Slow but good and $20 per day.Free Breakfast- This was truly laughable. We receieved tickets for free breakfast and were expecting at least continental breakfast. It was literally toast, pineapple juice and coffee. Luckily, Dennys and Starbucks are only a few blocks away (along with a number of local options) so we just went elsewhere for breakfast. Pool- We didnt use the pool but it appeared shady and kid filled when we returned from the beach in the afternoon. Its on the east side of the hotel. Restraunt- We didnt eat there.

The pool area is very nice and the pool itself is a good size. When we checked in we were assigned a ""premium room"" as they call it,meaning a higher floor (11 floor). The carpets in the hallway are old,tired and dirty.The hallways are painted in a drab color.The carpets in the rooms have been taken out and replaced with a nice laminate flooring.But the sheers on the windows were stained and dirty.The small balcony area was not maintained and needed a good cleaning.The taps in the bathroom sink leaked everytime we turned them on as the washers inside were worn out.The television had poor reception when we arrrived and I notified the desk.They had a list of other people with the same television issues, and they added my room number to the list.The reception did improve so I was satisfied with that part. The business centre had computers with filthy dirty keyboards.Where is the maintenance staff? I did not want to spend my holidays running after them complaining about everything or I would be there all day.The beds were comfortable but nothing great.When we checked in,the lady did not tell us about the key card and how it works so we were left to figure it out for ourselves.It is the type that you put into a slot and the power turns on.When you leave the room,you pull the card out, and the power shuts off.One big problem: it also disconnects the power to the fridge! So everything we put in the fridge begins to get warm! We returned to the room to find warm liquids in our fridge.Who did all these crazy renovations? The free breakfast meant lining up with huge groups of Japanese tour groups (this hotel really caters to large groups from Japan and Korea) and eating toast and pineapple (the free continental breakfast) but finding a table was a challenge,so we ate outside where it rained that morning. The pool area is lovely but with one problem: it borders on a run-down apartment building next door which overlooks the pool area.There were screams coming from some kids in that building a few times when we were by the pool.The pool is not heated as far as I know. The staff,in general, will answer your questions and appear to be friendly.The problem is that they are not proactive in anything they do.They wait until you approach them first.I found this to be very unprofessional.Being friendly is easy,being helpful and outgoing means actually working. I was really looking forward to my stay at the Sand Villas but in the end,I felt let down and disappointed.I donot think I would stay here again.It also borders on the busy Ali Wai Boulevard which the police and ambulance use in Waikiki.So we could hear sirens from our ""premium room"".There are better alternatives in Waikiki.I would not recommend staying here.Its got some real issues that need attention.",Calgary,"swcgy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary</strong>",123,2.0

There is a ABC store on the corner for supplies and you can catch the Pink trolley to Ala Moana a little further down out front of the Ohana Waikiki West hotel. We ate at the Sand bar grill twice after long gruelling sight seeing days and enjoyed both meals, the prices were not bad. Breakfast was funny , you could request either 1, 2 ,3 or 4 pieces of toast but they still only gave you 1 butter and 1 jam and a small glass of pineapple juice.

He got much friendlier when he realized we would be utilizing valet parking for our entire week stay. The rest of the staff was very friendly and the room, while small, was clean and comfortable which is all we look for when it comes to travel.

We weren't expect too much from it. With ~$90 in summer, it is lower than most hotels in Waikiki area. The room is big enough but absolutely very basic, no frills at all. It looks like an 30-year Day Inn at a remote place. Parking is $18 valet. The free ""light"" breakfast is really quite light. Up to four french toasts and a small drink.Later, we moved to Sheraton Princess across the street. It costs around $25 more with tax, but the $12 resort fee includes a free parking which saves $6 compared with the valet here. But you get a much much nicer room and more comfortable bed. So, as I said, $20 is the gap between this hotel and a much nicer one in the same area.",Florida,"SkyTeamer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Florida</strong>",34,3.0

As I booked online there was a free bus service provided by the hotel and I was met at the airport by an agent with a sign. The service was also free for my departure trip.The reception staff were friendly and I was given an upgrade (unrequested) to a corner room with two balcony’s (lanai). I used a 10% discount voucher I was given upon check-in when i last stayed (2 yrs.’ earlier) and this was accepted with no problems. The room overlooked the Ala Wai Canal and looked towards the mountains and Diamond Head. This side of the hotel is my preference as it is quieter and the lanai gets the daytime sun to dry swimsuits. I always take an elastic clothes line to attach to the balcony chairs as the lanais can be quite windy places at times.The room was clean and tidy and the TV had been upgrades to a flat screen unit which meant more bench top area for storage which was appreciated. The bathroom was clean tidy and kept well stocked. Soap and shampoo were provided in dispensers attached to the wall. Tissues were provided and kept restocked during my two week stay. The room maid service was quick and friendly and too a good standard. The air conditioner is of the central type and was not noisy and did its job well. I turned it off at night as is my preference. The extractor fan in the bathroom was quite loud however it is only activated when the lights are on in the bathroom so this wasn’t a problem. There was a refrigerator in the room which did a good job of keeping things cool and was very quiet in operation. A coffee machine was also provided and came with a starter pack for your first brew. Ice was available from an ice machine on every 2nd floor and an ice bucket was provided. The lifts worked well no excessive wait times were noticed.A very basic breakfast is provided in the room charge and vouchers are provided. This consisted of coffee, pineapple juice, toast, jam, butter, pineapple pieces, and upon request a croissant. I used this service each day and used my own cup for the coffee with milk from my room as only a powdered creamer is provided which is not to my taste. This breakfast is perfectly acceptable considering the low cost of the accommodation.Pool towels are available from reception each day and the pool area has toilets and showers. There is a Spa pool and a beautiful clean pool. Loungers (no shade) and tables with sun shades are provided poolside and the bar will bring you drinks upon request. The pool is open in the evenings till around 9pm which is nice if you want a swim after a long day shopping. The bar on the ground floor adjacent to the lobby is open long hours and provides good food at a very reasonable price.Free wireless internet is provided in all rooms and the pool area. There is also cabled internet in the guest rooms and an Internet room with computers available at no charge. I found the wireless internet weak with my smart phone and found the pool area provided the best connection. If you are taking a laptop (they have larger aerials this may not be an issue) but I would take a cat5 cable just in case.Overall all and excellent trouble free stay and again for the budget traveller thoroughly recommended.Nearby restaurants that stood out during my two week stay were Jinroku Pacific Teppan Yaki, ground floor Pacific Monarch hotel (excellent) Lulus Restaurant on Kalakaua at the far end by the zoo (very good) with nice open window seating and Cha Cha Cha Mexican restaurant in Seaside Ave (very good) with outdoor seating).","Christchurch, New Zealand","Beachbuoynz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Christchurch, New Zealand</strong>",45,4.0

We had the standard double room which included a nice kitchenette with 2-burner stove, microwave, coffee maker, toaster, mini-fridge, sink, and table with 4 chairs. The room was not too small and overlooked their FABULOUS pool. There is even a screen/storm door in case you wanna leave the front door open for some fresh air. In addition to a temperature control A/C unit, there is also a ceiling fan in the room over the sofa. The front desk was very friendly and helpful and gave us coupons for a complimentary 'Wiki Wiki' breakfast - a light meal that included 2, 3, or 4 pieces of toast (your choice), a croissant, butter and jam, a cup of diced pineapple, and juice/coffee. If you wanna save more money, take bus 19 or 20 from Honolulu International Airport - it stops a short one block from the hotel on Kuhio Ave and Kanekapolei St. The beach is so close.

I chose this Hotel because of the location & price which was booked online through Hotels.com ($78/night) & was pleasantly surprised. Upon our arrival, though, there was a mix-up as I requested three single beds. This was one of the reasons also that I chose this Hotel. All of the Triple rooms had been taken but they had a room on the top (12th) floor ready for us. They said that they could give us a Roll-a way bed but upon seeing the room, there was not going to be any room for one. We made do with the 2 double beds. They did suggest that if we wanted the Triple room, we could switch in two days when it became available.We were on the side facing Honolulu which I would of preferred the other side facing Diamond Head because of the morning sun so it was a little cool while sitting out there enjoying your coffee.Breakfasts were ok. Not much to rave about. 4 pieces of toast, 1 coissant, pineapple tidbits, juice & tea or coffee. It was good to get something inside of you before heading out for the day. Aside from the room being small, everything else here seemed very good & took advantage of the Hospitality room when we needed to use the computer & also on our last day as we had a late flight. We were able to shower & get ready after spending the day at the pool which by far is one of the nicest ones in Waikiki & very private.The Island Sun Tour Desk & Misako were wonderful. She helped us with choosing & booking the best outings. She is very experienced & very knowledgable.The staff at this Hotel was very nice. If you had any concerns, they were quick to resolve. Always had fresh towels when requested.This hotel is by far not anything fancy but for the price it is really good. It is an old hotel but they are trying to renovate slowly & replaced all the carpets with laminant flooring which is nice but not too nice when you come back from the beach because of the extra sand on your feet. The location was really good. I liked that it wasn't busy around the Hotel which would of been a problem if we were down on Kalakua or Kuhio. ABC store down the street & a good sized Grocery Store on the next block over but can cut through parking lot across the street. This was a great place to get ready made food which you could just put in your fridge to eat throughout the day. We had a great time in Waikiki.

Another issue was guest not being able to come up to our room, i understand they wouldnt want people staying at the hotel for free with out paying, but come on, after certain activites you just want to relax and shower and just chill, and the fact that our friends staying at another hotel was not allowed up was just a no no for me. so in the end we decided to just go to another hotel and they said because we booked through expedia we would have to call them, nothing they could do and were really rude about it, so we did and expedia was super nice and helpful and had no problem refunding our room and even gave us a $50 coupon for future bookings. So we called front desk and let them know and now they had a change of heart, telling us that the day was already payed for so we might as well stay the rest of the day but we didnt want them trying to sneak in any charges and we really just didnt want to be there any longer so we just left.",Bellflower,"fredrixxenvy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bellflower</strong>",0,2.0

Other positives included : the bar/restaurant with a special shoutout to Deb, the bartender, the quietness of the room, very reasonable parking fee, shuttle service to and from the airport, and the hospitality room with free computers.Minor complaints are that the bed was a tad lumpy and that one day the room didn't get cleaned.All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would return.","Buffalo, New York","MalibooNewYork</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Buffalo, New York</strong>",50,4.0

The Bad: very uncomfortable/ hard plastic wrapped mattresses, the car/bus/semi traffic noise is overwhelming on the front and rear of the building, the city view is actually a view of the hotel across the street, the continental breakfast (breakfasts lite) consisted of tiny Costco croissants, canned pineapple in small cups and toast.Final thoughts: its a cheap room in an expensive venue. Request a room on floors 6-9 facing Diamond head. The view is much better and the traffic noise is less overwhelming. The restaurant offers a decent steak dinner with rice for about $10.00.

To summate our stay here, let's see:1. We booked for a king Size bed in the room.... upon arrival we were told that they were sold out of King size bed room suites..... and they only have 5 King size rooms in the whole hotel. Please keep this in mind, they really mean it when they say bookings are not guranteed.- They check us into an OK room hardwood floor, Japanese Bidet in the bathroom.. however, the only rooms available had 1 full size bed and 1 twin bed....Make a long story short..... we put the two beds together.....My husband did not deserve a twin size bed...come on now!1. First night, we are awoke at 4am, to a drunken couple "" doing it"" ...... we could hear grunts and the manly sounding lady saying "" oooh baby.... ooohhh baby"" ..... LOL! i immediately was on the phone with the front desk, who didn't do much about it.- I followed up at 8am, complained again to Nancy... she was great at her job!Nancy said the loud drunken couple were checking out that day so it wouldn't be a prob...however.... she later called, to our dismay, to tell us that the couple would not be checking out.!!!!!!!!!!!....... but she was able to find us our king size bed suite. Rm. 420. Corner room. too good to be true right?Please see my attached pictures :Room 420 , did not have hardwood floors or a bidet...... it has old really dirty nasty dingy carpet, so disgusting that we chose to wear our shoes indoors, and just a regular toilet seat, and soap and shampoo dispensers.....There were bugs living on top of the Armoire drawer..... they almost looked like little white fleas... .In addition :- There were holes in the curtains/draperies- Bird poop all over the "" balcony"" and chairs/table-Rooms are not cleaned until about 5pm each day....... we had to call the front desk each day; we purposely did our excursions first....... and left the room to be cleaned... I mean , how crappy is that, you come back to a dirty hotel room after a long day out when all you want to do is come home and relax.....- Also, the "" stainless steel"" towel rack in our bathroom had mold growing all over it.- DIRTY DIRTY CARPETS !!!!!Yes, this hotel is definitely a "" budget"" hotel, and as i said before, if you don't mind sleeping in a dump, then stay here....however......In Oahu, you really do get what you pay for........... i expected this to be a budget hotel but i wasn't expecting it to be soo damn rundown. It's like, they are so many guests/$$$ checking in, and they can't be bothered to clean the carpet, clean the fungus/mold growing on the towel rack, .......The only good things :-Somewhat walking distance to all the downtown stuff..only 3 blocks away from International Marketplace....-Free Internet ( you actually need key card to open the door but some people who are not guests will come to this hotel, get into the elevator and knock on the door for you to open it... i mean what are you going to say, "" um sorry against the rules"" ....-Decent Happy hour at the Sand Bar and grill, however food is very limited in choices and in addition, very prices.....10 bucks for a breakfast, small portions!OOH WAIT! I almost forgot to mention the ""Free Continental Breakfast"" ......I guess we were spoiled, having just checked out of the Aston On the beach Hotel.... but wow, really low marks for this continental breakfast....... All you can eat burnt toast, coffee, watered down pineapple juice, and a sliver of pineapple served in a tiny 6 oz cup.They do serve croissants but the attendant lady is serving them one by one on a single small plate, and will make sure to tell you "" only one per person"".. she practically will snatch it out of your hand....they run out quick ! They literally hide the croissants and dole them out ONLY one per person.....

Valet parking only for $16/day, which isn't too bad compared to other hotels in Waikiki.

It's a few blocks away, ~10 min walk.The free breakfast is pretty lame, but it's free, so I won't knock it too much. Toast, mini croissants (which they run out of fast), canned Dole peaches, canned pineapple juice, coffee, and tea. If you bring your own thermos, they might fill it with coffee for you. Some of the staff were nicer than others. We stayed for a week, and only had 1 problem. The cleaning staff left our door room ajar, but luckily nothing was missing.

The hotel is great value compared to the many somewhat overpriced hotels that dominate this area. Located just a 5 minute walk from the beach unless you want to stay right on the beach itself, this hotel couldn't be better located.The rooms are basic with flat screen TV and fridge/small freezer. They are kept very clean by the staff with bed linen and towels changed daily. There is free WiFi in all the rooms and bar/reception area and there is also a small business centre providing free computer usage and printing at a cost of 10c per sheet.The hotel arranges free airport pick-up and drop-off for stays over 5 nights with Ilima and this went very smoothly and was a big saving on the usual $35 one-way taxi fare.Overall I can't recommend this hotel highly enough for anyone wanting a near beach location in Waikiki on a budget.

I checked the hotel on line and noticed they offered free WiFi, a continental breakfast and the pictures looked really nice- I thought I was really getting a bargain. Ha, what a rip off. We took a shuttle from the airport to the hotel, making several stops along the way at real nice hotels and resorts. I as really getting my hopes up. When they came to the Sand Villa, it might as well been name the Sand Flea-ah. What an old looking, run down dump. Good thing we didn't have a car rental as they would have charged us $20 a night to store it. The person checking us in was really ""short"" with us. The room was small and the bed was a full size-both my wife and I are tall so our feet hung off the bed all night long. They had a small fridge and range. The A/C sits above the bed and was noisy and dusty. There was no ocean view, only brick from the one window and the pool from the other. The Wifi didn't work and it took the IT guy a day to show up to my room and fix it. When we got up the first morning, the lobby was full of Asian tourists- elbow to elbow. The breakfast consisted of toast, a small cup of pineapples, water and coffee. I took four pieces up to the room and two glasses of pineapple. When we got back to the hotel from Pearl Harbor the next night, we wanted to go to the pool, but again, it was full of Asians, literally hundreds of them. I guess they must really advertise in China and Japan, and cater to this group of people because I didn't see any other race there the whole time. They converted two rooms at night to a sushi restaurant, but it looked private so we didn't attempt to enter in. The bellhop was the only thing nice about the whole stay, as he stored our luggage for us and shared small talk while we waited for our ride back to the airport. I don't think we'll have to worry about coming back, especially since Honolulu is a joke as well- Pearl harbor unfortunately was a disappointment too. At least the flea market at Aloha stadium was worthwhile. The bus system takes too long to go anywhere and the beaches are full of 1960 wannabees.

Also you can take a nice walk along the canel just right across the street from the hotel.

We picked the Sand Villa due to its proximity to the beach and shopping, as well as the price. A bonus for us, was that the hotel included continental breakfast, and had a hot tub. Not many hotels we researched in Waikiki had those 2 ammenities. We found the Sand Villa to be well used, but also clean and very friendly. It was great for us to get rooms that had 3 single beds (no kids fighting about sleeping arrangements) and the toilet/bidet was an interesting addition to the washroom. The bathroom has a dispenser for liquid soap and shampoo in the bathtub/shower area. I brought my own conditioner and was glad I did. Our room had a little fridge, coffeemaker and tv. The coffee is free only the first day, and then you can buy the packets at the front desk if you choose. We knew this in advance and packed some filters and coffee so we could enjoy coffee whenever we wanted. We used the valet parking which was easy and billed to our room at the end of our stay. This cost 15.75 per day. Our car rental was from Dollar, and we got a great rate by using the Entertainment book. Free breakfast was great to get us started in the morning, and saved on our overall budget. Two blocks to the beach was convenient, although the pool and hot tub area of the hotel was very nice and secluded with tropical foliage throughout, making it a nice retreat at the end of a busy day. Shopping and restaurants were only a block away. A nice feature of the hotel was free internet access in the hospitality room, and free use of the room at the end of the day when our flight left late in the evening. It had internet access so we could check our flight status, and a small bath with shower to freshen up. We asked for some pool towels before we checked out so we could enjoy the beach/pool area one last time before our flight. The hotel is located right on the corner of the Ali Wai Canal, and so there is a bit of noise from the traffic, and the emergecy vehicle station (the odd ambulance every day) but still less than if you stay right on Kuhio.

It is rated as two and a half stars on most travel websites which I think is fair. It really would be nicer with just a little touching up: some paint and some carpet cleaning, especially in the guest rooms and hallways. I don't want to imply that it was dirty, because the rooms were given plenty of attention by housekeeping and the staff took good care of the place, ownership just needs to give a little attention to detail. The pool area is small but well kept and beautiful. The wiki breakfast is exactly what they advertise and had toast, canned pineapple, donuts, croissants,coffee and juice. It was plenty if you don't need a huge breakfast each day. The best part of the place is the Sand Bar downstairs, reasonably priced with good food and drinks (Cocktails for $3 at happy hour and they were NOT watered down!). The bar staff is awesome and make you truly feel welcome as a visitor. They not only take care of guests but draw a regular local group that are equally friendly. The hotel staff were friendly and will help you in any way the can but they don't necessarily go out of their way to make sure you are ok, you have to ask for assistance. Overall, this is a hotel for folks that are independent travelers and can figure things out for themselves and are working with a budget. You can't come into it thinking you are going to be staying at the some ritzy Waikiki hotel.

The complimentary coffee for the room is first day only afterwards you pay for it. No microwaves in the rooms but you can upgrade to a kitchen unit for around $35 extra a night. The hot tub wasn't hot and was very dirty. The pool is heated by the sun and is a bit cold for my liking. The restaraunt in the hotel is not too bad and makes good mixed drinks. They will serve you drinks out at the hot tub if you order at the counter. Average is about 5-15 dollars for a meal. They have happy hour specials for drinks at 2.25 for wells. The breakfast consists of Kona coffee, cup of pineapple (canned), croissant, donuts (mini), and ""Go-Gurt"" squeazable yogurt. There is also a ""hidden"" sushi place at the hotel which appears to be popular with many of the Japanese guests. The housekeeping is very slow so if you are near the top like we were don't expect to get your room cleaned until late afternoon.

According to the pictures online, this hotel looked lovely and was a great deal..... Our two sons had booked a night the week before for one night before our cruise and located a wonderful room in the Waikiki harbor area. Unfortunately, we were swayed by the advertisement for this hotel for ""1/2 price winter rates with a continental breakfast."" The rooms were old and falling apart - paint peeling off the ""balcony furniture"" and stained rugs. We booked two rooms because we were 5 adults - and the rooms did not look like the pictures advertised. The free ""wifi"" also advertised did not work in either room. Upon our arrival, we were too early to check in and our bags were put into storage. Two of our bags were misplaced. These two bags contained computers and books/papers from our son's PhD rotations. The front desk clerks (two young men who should be trained as to customer service) thought it a joke when we asked to contact the police because of the value of the contents in these bags - neither budged to help us and one was amused by our plight. Our bags were located and the only person who should be given any admiration was the employee in charge of the security room who truly was concerned and helped us. The continental breakfast was a joke.... tea and coffee in urns, toast thrown into a wicker basket, canned pineapple dumped in a bowl and some juice and frozen gogurts... all set out in a rather unsanitary area on the way to the ""pool."" Neither room was worth the original cost of $240 per night (and we did get the 1/2 price deal for each room) while our sons had a beautiful room the only night for $90 overlooking the harbor.

At first glance the hotel appears to be very clean, however, as you start your way to the room you will quickly smell and see that this hotel is definitely not tidy. The quality of the hotel can be summed up in the fact that the mattresses are completely covered in thick plastic.

Seemed like most travelers liked the place, and the price was only about $60 per night. After staying there for 14 days, I was most impressed to say the least!The rooms were a little small but clean and more than adequate, The bed was perfect and sanitary, due to the plastic sheet covering the mattress. I really didn't want to sleep atop ancient body fluids and bed bugs. The sheet was covered by a thick fabric cover and bottom sheet, so I hardly knew it was there. The bathroom was functional as was the TV set, large mini fridge. The dresser was huge and the rest of the furnature and decor were nice as well, the big teakwood mirror was a nice touch. Both sides of the hotel have spectacular views of the Ala Moana Canal, and the golfcourse and mountains beyond. No I coundn't see the ocean, but the view was just fine.. The carpet was older but clean, I spent most of the time barefoot, and it was never an issue. I was on the sixth floor and road noise was never an issue. I read a few negative reviews about the carpet, noise, ect.. but I disagree, I was there for half a month, and the rooms were more than adequate. For the price, it was a downright steal!!! The rooms do have internet, just borrow a cable from the front desk. It's not the fastest, but fine for my purposes, including online phone calls.When reading other reviews, most people agreed that the location was a good one. I timed the walk to the beach, and it was exactly 7 minutes. If it look 10 minutes or longer for you then, you must be crippled or something. It's central location allows you to walk to anywhere in waikiki in 25 minutes or less. I enjoyed the International Market for a cheap place to eat, and highly recommend ""Rainbow Sushi"", which makes an excellent Miso soup for only a dollar. I had the 18 piece sushi tray for about $6. The ""Haute' ""Dog"" place had an excellent Chicago dog, with fries and a coke for $7.50. Nearby ""Fattys Chinese"" was a fun place to eat, where you could watch the cook make your food from 5 feet away. For finer dining (and reasonable drinks), Duke's Place is my favorite beach bar and restaurant. Their you can buy a nice big sandwich for $8, or a full meal for less than $20, the drink prices were the most reasonable I found right on the water, with gin and tonics (made with the good stuff), for $5.00. There was usually a pleasant local musician with excellent but not overpowering music. What I loved the most about Dukes was the outdoor patio seating, where you could walk 20 feet to the beach, strip off your clothes (you need a swimsuit or shorts of course), and dive in the surf, then return to you seat, and it's all good. The music and tiki torches right on the beach, made for a perfect tranquil night. This is a very classy place, but easygoing and laid back at the same time. Much of the time I spent my evenings at the hotel pool and hot tub. After a long day of walking thru Waikiki, there is nothing better than to sit in the large and powerful hot tub, which would massage your aches away in no time. I found it to be a good place to meet new friends, since it's hard to sit in a tub without talking to the other guests. This was important to me, since I was alone. I met some very nice people there. The bar was perfect. The lighting was dim enough to be cosy, bright enough to where you could read the menu. The Bar staff were all professional and pleasant, and gave good advice on things to do and see. Wade is the only bartender whose name I can recall, but all the bar staff were first class. The bar's patrons were mainly locals, and talking to them gave me much insight on the ""real Waikiki"". The food was pretty good with decent prices, and I had nearly everything on the menu, This was a very nice place, and my favorite bar on Waikiki overall. Its was almost too conveniant since I closed the bar down more than a few times. I really liked the hard working dedicated staff of the Sand Villa, I got to know nearly everyone from the helpful front desk people, to the cleaning crew and the Valets. All were quite helpful and seemed happy with their jobs. Dee and Blaine from the front desk were always happy to help me with new room keys, pool towels, as were the rest of the front desk employees. When waiting for a tour I had some time to get to know the valet man ""Bobby"", he was very professional, loved his job, and always made sure I got to my tour bus on time. The pool crew and cleaning crew were kind and helpful as well.My cleaning lady had my room looking perfect every time with a smile. The Sand Villa is a great place to stay, what a makes a good hotel a great one is the ethos and dedication of the staff. At no point in my 14 nights did any staff member displease me. I will be coming back here next time I stay in Waikiki.","AUSTIN, TX.","Trebek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>AUSTIN, TX.</strong>",34,5.0

Short walk to everything Waikiki has to offer.I booked a standard room which had two double beds (would be quite small if four people were staying there though, but for one I found it very spacious) and I managed to score a corner room which had a wonderful view of the Ala Wai Canal and golf course. The room could use a little updating, there were some stains on the carpet but overall tidy and clean. I've stayed in much worse for a much higher price. I experienced none of the problems that other reviewers have mentioned.I have to mention the Sand Villa Bar and Grill, great food and drinks, super friendly staff and friendly locals, very laid back and a nice place to spend an evening. Even if I didn't stay at the hotel I'd go back there. I stayed 7 nights and am confident that I will return to this hotel on my next visit to Oahu.

If you want a cheap room with a decent breakfast and pool, this is it. Luxury and ideal other guests, not this place. Then my kids were on the other side of the hall looking at another building and someone from the building across the street was looking at them through binoculars. CREEPY. There is no such thing as ""views"" at this place. You can look at the Ala Wei canal or some of the mountains and thats it.

The location of the hotel is terrific. Just a few blocks from the ocean, we could easily walk to many other hotels and restaurants, as well as Waikiki Beach. I felt comfortable walking back to the hotel after dark because there always seemed to be people out & about. However, some people might be wary of this since you go through a small area of less touristy (more residential type apartments) and it is not brightly lit (although there are streetlights...it isn't dark by any means...just be aware that the main street--Kalakaua Ave.--is brighter).

The hospitality room had up-to-date computers, fast connection, and a copier/fax machine. We were placed in a room overlooking Diamond Head. According to the hotel's room map, we were in a deluxe room. The room was just okay. The beds in the room were a double and a single bed and they were comfortable.

The hotel is centrally located right on Ala Wai Blvd and Kaiulani Ave--it is next to some older low-rise apartments (NOT crack houses!) and only a 150 yards from Kuhio Ave which is one the main streets of Waikiki.  I had room 1207 which was a standard room on the 12th floor right behind the elevator shaft. The room had a single and queen size bed, and a small desk. The bath was adequate, the carpet was excellent and the room was very clean. The linens were also more than adequate. The furnishings were in very good to excellent condition. There was a Panasonic TV and a nice size refrigerator. The rooms have a small safe with Medeco high security locks (no charge). Overall, I was very pleased with the room.  The only negative for the room was that it was noisy. One reason is no fault of the hotel--Ala Wai Blvd is main street out of Waikiki and Waikiki itself is a densely packed and noisy environment. The other factor is that the elevator shaft was right behind the wall of this room and every time the elevators moved you could hear the noise elevators.  The parking valets were extremely friendly and really hustled. The normal parking rate is $15/day but I got it for $7.50 by making my reservations through AAA. This is cheap parking for Waikiki.  I don't drink so I can't comment on the bar. I did try the fish and chips from the menu, though. It was $8.95 and was excellent. The food prices were very reasonable for Waikiki--I don't know who thought the prices were expensive.  The hotel had a lot of Japanese tourists and caters to this clientele. There is a food service in the lobby that makes ""bento"" boxes for the Japanese crowd--I didn't try them but given that the proprietors were from Japan, the bento lunches looked very appetizing and authentic.  The Hospitality room had 6 computers and I used them to check my email and surf the web.  The pool was large and very nice but I did not use it. The continental breakfast was served at poolside from 6:30-9am. This was very basic with coffee, cereal, toast, bagels and donuts and some kind of juice. (There might have been a few other items as well). This was the only disappointing aspect of the hotel.  Overall, the public areas of the hotel were very clean and well maintained and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.  Since the hotel breakfast wasn't appealing, you can walk to several restaurants within 2-5 minutes. There is a great restaurant 150 yards away in the Ohana West Hotel which offers fast and reasonable meals.  Just a half a block away is an ABC Stores--it's like an upscale 7-Eleven and they are everywhere on the islands. The hotel is centrally located and close to the beach or if you are driving, as you exit the hotel you're right on Ala Wai Blvd with takes you out of Waikiki. Best of all the average cost per night for my 4 nights (one weekend night) including tax was only $97!  This hotel wasn't luxurious but it was clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly and the price was more than reasonable.

I know it has been a while but I am on here now looking at our honeymoon destination, The El Dorado Royale, for October and I thought I would write up my review. Let me start with the good things. The best thing about this hotel by far is the pool and bar area. The pool was large and clean and we had a lot of fun. It was rarely overcrowded and we loved it. The drinks at the lobby bar were reasonably priced and the bartenders were very nice, although the appetizers and food you could get at the bar were over priced and not very good. The atmosphere was pretty cool as they had a pool table, juke box, and computers with internet access. It was really nice to sit down for a few cold ones after the 8 hour flight believe me.The rooms were pretty clean and we got a corner room overlooking the canal which was nice. The A/C worked really well but the weather in Hawaii is so mild you almost don't need it at night. When I am on vacation I don't really worry too much about the rooms because I rarely spend a lot of time in them. All I ask is that they are clean and the A/C and/or heat works. Ours also had a TV and a mini fridge which was nice.Now for the not so good. The continental breakfast was a joke. It consisted of some stale bagels and mini muffins. There was cereal one day and some juice but that was about it. The service was not all that great either. When we got there they had us booked into the wrong room and then tried to charge us for the correct room. They were pretty snotty about it until we contacted Travelocity and they got it straightened out. And of course the aforementioned food in the bar which wasn't great.Overall this hotel is a pretty nice place for the money. It is within comfortable walking distance to Waikiki Beach and is kept pretty clean. For the price we paid I don't have any major complaints. If you have never been to Hawaii and are planning to go my advice to you is to go to Maui. There is a lot more to do there.

I was looking for a place that was decent, clean, and close to everything, but wasn't going to ruin my budget since I didn't plan to be in the room much anyway--and I was pleased that it more than fit the bill for me!!! The staff was fantastic--so friendly--the spirit of Aloha is alive and well here. Everyone I came into contact with was helpful and kind. The valet parking staff was superb! I hurt my foot while I was there, and four days later, one of the parking guys asked me how it was. I hadn't seen him for 4 days and yet he remembered, even though they were super busy! Getting a maintenance person to come see about my TV only took about 5 minutes--the front desk called back to tell me he was outside the door, and then he knocked and announced himself--safety is a big deal with them. The hotel was kept clean and although I only chose to have maid service every other day, I could have had it every day. They did a great job cleaning and straightening the room.I will say two things: 1) The room carpeting needs replacing. I realize it gets trampled on every day of the year, but it is time for an upgrade. The carpets in the hallways were beautiful, so it's time to do the rooms! And, 2) Their ""continental breakfast"" is not quite that...watery OJ, yesterday's pastries, and coffee that was only lukewarm. So, if you need a good breakfast to start the day (like I did, so I could go for hours!), check out the many places that offer a decent-sized breakfast for $2.99 - $4.99. In all fairness, I did leave these comments with them on their little survey sheet. However, overall, it was a fantastic experience, and I would stay there again in a moment.

Room service did not come until, some days, after 5:00 in the evening. This became somewhat of a problem when we would come back to the room to make dinner, and the maid still hadn't been there. But what threw this hotel over the edge were the rats. Food was missing from the room the entire week and finally one night, while watching tv, we saw why. There were two large holes in the wall behind the tv cabinet and the rats came out while we were still awake to look for more food.

It was very cute and cozy and for $160 per night, I thought it was a deal. There is a small pool and clean bar/restaurant area in the lobby. The free breakfast in the morning was mini-doughnuts, toast, coffee, OJ and mini-croissants (something to hold you over until lunch). The hotel is about 2 to 3 blocks from the beach so that was the only thing I didn't like but it was across the street from a grocery store which was very, very convenient! The service was okay; I liked the free Internet access in the computer room (2nd) floor. The computers are new and there were about 10 computers so I never had to wait.

First off I would like to say that my wife and I stayed there for 5 nights and never had any problems.A few people put down that they had a horrible stay and problems with the staff. I believe that they went into their trip with a chip on their shoulders. Because I couldn't find any problems with the hotel or staff.The reseveration lady I did bussiness with was name Sally, and she gave me A++++ service. She's the best!The hotel had everything you wanted, Surfboard rentals, a coffee shop, sushi counter, a nice bar, a nice size pool, a very nice and clean lobby, and A VERY FRIENDLY and HELPFULL STAFF. The rooms where always very clean when we would come back from doing whatever we went out to do. The location was great, we walk to everything, International Market, Resturants, Shows, Ticket companies, shops, and of course the beach. Everything was about a 3 minute walk. We rented a SUV for our stay which we only used twice, not including the trip to and from the airport.One thing that we liked about the hotel was the hospitality suite, which had two massage chairs, ($1 dollar for 5 minutes), 5 free internet computers, a TV, a couple of couches, and 2 showers and restrooms. which came in handy on our last day.Also they will hold your bags for you, for no charge, after you have checked out, which in our case our flight left at 12 midnight so it came in good use. They have valet parking only, and the cost for a days parking is $9.00. I understood why they have valet parking, it's because the garage is VERY tight. Will I stay here again, YES, and I will. They treat you first class all the way. I have stayed at other hotels, including a high priced one on Waikiki beach, and I didn't have the same quality of hospitality that the Waikiki Sand Villa gave us.

If you're planning to spend any downtime in the hotel at all, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.My main problem was that the air conditioner in my room did not work at all, so I slept with the lanai doors open all night for ventilation. In humid Hawaii, air conditioning is a must have, at least for me. The beds are hard and uncomfortable, but if you're tired enough you might not notice. Otherwise, the place was decent and fairly clean, except for the carpet which was really dingy. I stayed here for 5 nights, and by the end of my trip I was more than ready to leave. If I ever go back to Honolulu, I'll definitely stay someplace nicer. The barebones hotel had more of an impact on my vacation than I thought it would.

The hotel is in the middle of upgrading things (at least the lobby, as they has parts of it roped off as workers were laying down shiny new tile; the elevator cabs appear to be brand new, too). In the lobby area there is a small bar, a Japanese food stand (selling various rolls and other mysterious items), and then another cafe off to the side that didn't have anything appetizing looking at all (I remember seeing the words ""Ham & Lettuce Wrap, $4"" on the chalkboard). Positives: free internet(!) They have a lounge with machines you can use or you can borrow an Ethernet cable (from the front desk) and hook it up to a jack in your room and surf the net from your laptop. There is also a wireless router in the pool area (the signal from which is too weak to be picked up anywhere else in the hotel, including the lobby area).Booking through the hotel website, I paid for the cheapest room possible (the charge for my one night stay appeared on my card right away, I am not sure if it is a one night deposit or if they will charge for the entire stay ahead of time). While the room they gave me (1015) was very basic, I really liked that I had two balconies. One with a nice view of the canal and the hills. The other one you can kinda make out the ocean between the buildings of the Hyatt. The beach is only a few streets away.I parked my rental car in their valet parking (just under $10 per night), which I believe was a pretty good deal for Waikiki. The valet guy was really nice and let me park a few extra hours beyond my checkout without charge, although they say they reserve the right to charge a half day valet parking rate ($5).The pool appeared to be really clean and nice. They have a whirlpool as well (the timer switch to turn it on is on the other side of the pool.. I saw a few people sitting in the inactive whirlpool without realizing it could be switched on). The bathrooms next to the pool were fetid, but functional.Negatives: The ""breakfast"" was a joke... you can take your choice of any or all of 1) mini doughnuts 2) various danishes cut in half 3) toast with butter or jam. There's also a juice machine and I think coffee as well. If you are looking for fresh fruit or something more appetizing you can pick up groceries at the ABC store (they're ubiquitous in Waikiki) on the corner and store them in your room fridge. For the price I paid, I was quite satisfied with my stay. I'd stay there again.","San Francisco, California","MalcoveMagnesia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",627,4.0

I found an EXCELLENT rate on Expedia for the WSV and decided to give it a try. There were good and bad things about this hotel....First-the good things:The staff was very friendly and helpful-front desk, valet and housekeeping. Upon checking in and checking out, the front desk really made me feel that they were happy to have me as a guest. That alone might make me want to return!The pool area is very nice! There is not alot of sun in the morning but by afternoon there are quite a few sunny areas. There are tables and chairs as well as lounge chairs and many people had lunch or coctails poolside. Nice place to hang out if you tire of the sand at the beach :)Nice little workout room right by the pool with several treadmills and other equipment. I did not use it because I ran by the canal and the running path by the zoo, but it would be nice for someone who likes to work out in air conditioning.The Sand Bar sports bar with big screen TVs is a great place to hang out. Located right inside the lobby of the hotel, it's a fun place to have cocktails. They have happy hour daily from 4-7 with $2 beer and $2 glasses of wine (although I wish they would change their brand of wine. There are so many good ones that are inexpensive that taste a whole lot better :) They are in the process of renovating the bar area and it looks like it will be about 3 times the size when they are finished. Free internet service is located in the bar and it's nice to have a drink and check your email. Freddy the bartender is great...very friendly and he makes a great Mai Tai (which are $1 cheaper at happy hour). I met alot of nice locals that hang out here too.The location of the hotel is convenient. Just about two blocks from the beach and right across the street from the Ala Wai Canal. There is a Food Pantry across the street that is fully stocked with grocery items with a little bakery and deli. They also have a large selection and good prices and on beer and wine.The hotel and hotel room was clean. I stayed in room 620-a room with a double bed and a twin bed (considered a premium city corner room). While it was evident that the carpet was a bit worn and the bathroom really needs updated, it was clean although small. The housekeeping service was better some days than others but I always had clean towels and they always cleaned the bathroom daily. The room also had a nice size mini refrigerator which I stocked with some items from the Food Pantry. There was also a 4 cup coffee maker with 1 free pack of coffee. (You could purchase more at the front desk for $1 if you so desired). The only problem was that the plug for the coffee maker did not reach the outlet in the back of the wall so I had to sit the tray on the floor to make coffee. No big deal really. There was ample drawer space and a place to hang your clothes with hangers furnished. The cable TV offered plenty of stations if you want to unwind with tv at the end of the night or catch the news in the morning. A desk with one chair sat in the corner. This room was comfortable enough for 2 people. A bit small but I've been in smaller rooms.The hotel did have a safe available in the room to use for $2.50 a day. What I appreciated the most about this is that they did not automatically charge you, like alot of hotels do. If you wanted to use the safe you asked the front desk for a key for it. Otherwise there was no charge. Nice.There is valet parking available for approx $9.50 per day with in and out privilleges. We were always able to park no matter what time of the day we went in and out. I did, on occasion see parking available at the meters on the side street.Now the cons---none of which ruined my vacation!I would not book a 'premium' room again. They consider it a premium room because it has 2 balconies. The balconies are very small and NOT worth the extra cost. It was still nice to sit outside and have a glass of wine. (there are 2 chairs and a small table). I had a city premium corner room but still had a bit of a view of the Ala Wai Canal (very pretty, with the golf course in the background). The view of the city was nothing pretty.The noise in the morning of the 'beeping' of the garbage trucks was annoying. It started pretty early (like 5 am) and lasted what seemed like forever! :) after a few days I started getting use to it but it might be less noisy on a higher floor. I was on the 6th.Both the bathroom sink and the bathtub drain backed up daily. I had to learn just how much I could turn the faucets on to avoid the tub and sink filling up. Annoying but I finally got a system down! :) Perhaps management could occasionally 'snake' the pipes to avoid this.The complementary breakfast by the pool was a nice gesture but it's mainly white toast and prepackaged doughnut holes. It would be nice if they just offered some wheat toast, bagels or fruit with coffee. The coffee cups were very small styrofoam cups that you could drink down in two gulps. Perhaps bigger cups with lids so you could fill your cup and hit the road. Also, they only serve until 9am. After a night on the town it's nice to sleep in since it's vacation :) Still, it was nice that they made an effort to offer something to their guests.My stay here was pleasant and I had a wonderful time while on Oahu. I climbed Diamond Head one morning and it was a nice workout! Make sure you take a water bottle! The view from the top is beautiful. Lots of wonderful restaurants. I especially like Chuck's Cellar located a block away in the Ohana East. Wonderful prime rib with a nice soup and salad bar. It's also a piano bar-dark with lots of ambiance and high leather booths. A great place for a mai tai with a gorgeous view is the Hale Koa Hotel located next door to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The Barefoot Bar is really nice and we met some great people there.I hope your future travels are happy ones!Lisa","Peoria, IL","Lisa C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Peoria, IL</strong>",65,3.0

Most of the other tour companies dropped off their customers and left them. I think that most of the negative reviewers expect a five star hotel when they pay low prices to stay at this hotel. If they want a five star hotel, then they should stay at the Hyatt or Sheraton and pay $600/night. The Waikiki Sand Villa met our needs and then some. It was clean and well appointed.

Unfortunately we thought we'd save some money by staying at the Sand Villa for two nights before moving on to the very expensive Hyatt (which is the only hotel available this weekend due to the NFL Pro Bowl.) Big mistake.We requested a non-smoking room because I'm pregnant and very sensitive to smells. We were told at check-in that they're full and so we were being given a smoking room, but ""there's a brisk wind so if you open the door to the lanai, it should be okay."" Well it is not. The room smells so bad it's almost unbearable. I did leave the door to the lanai open until 3 a.m. at which point I had to shut it in order to finally sleep. The traffic outside of the hotel along the canal is horrible, even at 3 a.m., and very noisy. We also requested 1 bed (a double bed is the only option) but were instead given a room with a small double and a single bed which I can't even call a twin because it's so small. The mattresses are 30 years old I'm sure and very, very uncomfortable. The room is very tiny to begin with, so having both beds leaves very little room to maneuver around or to stow luggage.Some other unpleasant surprises in our tiny, tiny room (besides the horrible ""lemon-lime sherbet"" decor) were hair from the prior guest on the floor of the bathroom (the bathroom smelled like urine I might add,) and a huge blob of black hair on one of the pillows. The carpet is so slimy I won't walk around without my flip flops on, you can hear every noise in the hotel all night long. The mini-fridge in our room rattles and makes a strange noise for 10 seconds after each time it runs (also making it hard to sleep,) and there's a thick layer of dust around the perimeter of the room and on top of the TV. This is obviously not a room they use (1104) unless the hotel is very full. Beware if you're checking into a full hotel! The pool was completely shaded by 3p yesterday when we checked in and with the strong trade winds and mid 70's we've been experiencing, it is hard to be outside without the benefit of the sun to warm you. As an FYI - parking is $10/nt.The positives to this hotel are the free internet service in the hospitality room for guests and the mini-fridge in your room. The lobby bar stays open until 4a if that's important to you, but it's usually quite crowded. It's about 3 blocks to Waikiki and the view of the canal/mountains in the other direction is pretty. We paid $110 for the first night and $160 for the second night (plus taxes and fees on Expedia.) I wish we would've paid the extra and gotten a room in the $189 range that was clean and well cared for. Staying here has made me feel better about the insane $325/nt we're paying for the Hyatt this weekend, knowing that we'll be leaving the Sand Villa and never returning!","Minneapolis, Minnesota","LuvToGo5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",148,1.0

Eight of us flew in two days before the cruise left in order to see Pearl Harbor, the USS Arizona Memorial, & the USS Missouri. We booked our own airfare and hotel instead of going through NCL America. This was cheaper and worked fine since we were arriving so much before the cruise. It is cheap – but not that great of a hotel. They have no airport shuttle, nor any suggestions on how to get there from the airport. When we arrived at approximately 10 p.m. Honolulu time (it was 2 a.m. to our jet lagged minds and bodies,) we found out that half the hotel did not have electricity! The power had been off for about an hour and a half and they didn’t know when they would gain full power again. The kicker was that they “didn’t know” which half the hotel had power and which half didn’t!! They suggested we buy a drink at the bar and wait a half hour because then they might have enough power to run the elevators and get our luggage to us on the third floor. We had my 72 & 76-year-old grandparents with us, and explained that there was no way they could wait that long. The management was unwilling to find someone to carry the bags up to the third floor for them. My husband and my room was the only one with power, so we all just took a carry-on up. My 70 year-old grandparents and my mother had to take showers in complete darkness. My uncle and my husband waited up for another hour until the power came on the elevators worked. When we telephoned the front desk to ask if our luggage would be delivered soon, they answered maybe. My husband and uncle then went down, found the manager, and had to force the manager to bring up the luggage himself because the bell boy went home. The next day and nights’ stays were much better. The rooms are clean and had nice amenities, such as mini fridges and lanais which were much appreciated. The hotel claims to have a free continental breakfast, but it is merely dry mini-doughnuts, orange juice drink (not actual orange juice) and coffee. The pool is very nice – beautiful and warm. The only problem with the pool is the hours. It doesn’t open until 9 a.m. and closes at 9 p.m. The hotel also has free high-speed Internet access for hotel guests. There is a hospitality room with 5 computers in it for guests’ use. The hotel did suggest a nice restaurant at a sister hotel for my grandparent's 50th wedding aniversary. However, when we asked where the shuttle they had promised to take us there was they denied ever making the promise. They gave us walking directions to the restaurant and turned away.Overall it is an okay hotel. It is good for the price - if you get it cheap through hotwire.com or Expedia. The rooms are clean and there are a few good amenities. It is only two blocks to Waikiki Beach - an easy walk. So, would we stay here agian?

I cannot even begin to write all that was needing cleaned or fixed in this hotel. From the moment you enter the smell of old cooking grease coming from the dingy bar area to the run down dirty greeting area sets the tone of what is yet to come. Our beds had head and body hairs in them, the box spring part of the bed was stained with food and body fluids. The blankets were so old and worn. Dust was abundant to the point you could write your name in it. The bathroom had hair in it, the mirror had not been cleaned with toothpaste splatter all over it. The carpet was worn and stained. The tracks in the sliding doors to the deck was so full of dirt it grated on your teeth when you opened and closed the door. The room smelled musty, dusty and unclean. I could go on more and more. When we complained they said they had no more rooms as they were full. So I wrote a list of things to be cleaned before we would accept the room. We went out to the pool area, which did have a decent size pool, but the hottub was black around the whole top of it, but I think this was just bare cement and had not been painted but was certainly not attractive. We then said we would go for a walk to wait for our room to be cleaned and on our way out I slipped an fell on the driveway where the non skid strips had worn down. I came back into the hotel being helped by my husband and the bell man that had witnessed the fall. I had scraped my knee fairly badly so there was a lot of blood. I asked for a cloth to wipe it off, and they came back and told me twice that they had nothing to help me, no cloth or bandaids, in fact they told me that they were not able to give out any bandaids. Then another bell man came a long and did get me some dry paper towels. Then a manager came a long and asked the bell man if the driveway was slippery and he said ""like a skating rink"". So they then upgraded us to a suite.Well this was somewhat better, but still filthy dirty. There was NO hot water unless you ran the taps for 8-10 minutes and then it was only warm. The room smelled old as well. The curtains were filthy dirty along with the dust. But what really got me was the dried urine all over the toilet lid and back of the toilet. I was tired of complaining so we just put up with it for 2 nights and have never been so glad to return home. Fortunately the cruise was absolutely wonderful and would recommend Royal Caribbean Serenade of the Seas ship for anyone. Next time I would go with the reviews (which I did read before I left but our travel agent was unable to find us anything else in the package company we had booked through) and book somewhere else.

It was a terrible experience and extremely disappointing. When I arrived in my room, the sheets on my bed were dirty. There were dark spots and what looked like makeup or self-tanner on the white sheet. I requested an immediate change of sheets from housekeeping. When the maid arrived, she told me that the hotel policy was to change sheets only every third day. If I wanted the sheets changed daily, I would have to call every day. There was no ""green policy"" posted regarding sheets, so this was not a water conservation issue. Not wanting to sleep on dirty sheets, I dutifully called each day to request that they be changed. Much to my horror, on my last night at the hotel, I discovered both the sheets and the pillowcases were dirty again. When I called to complain, I was told housekeeping was closed, but they would send someone up with cleansheets. I spent the night sleeping on the blanket and bedspread and vowed never to return. The other main problem I have with this hotel is the use of hidden fees. The website advertises several amenities that seem like they are included in your room rate -- but they are not. The website says the rooms have safety deposit boxes, but they charge you $2.00 a day to use them. Also you only get one free packet of coffee when you arrive. After that, if you want coffee for the coffee maker in your room, they charge you $1.00 per packet. Valet parking is $9 a day and you have to sign in for your ""free"" crappy continental breakfast. I should have known better when I was quoted an unbelievable rate of $86.00 a night. I wish I had chosen a different hotel which might have cost more, but at least would give me free coffee in my room!The website also advertises that the hotel is two blocks from the beach. Actually, it's closer to four. Why does this matter? Well, when you have to carry your heavy beach gear through the busy streets of Waikiki to the beach, every step makes a difference.Other issues/problems: The hotel staff is brusque to the point of being rude. Very inhospitable, especially in Hawaii. Bathroom tiles were chipped and uneven, making the place seem drab. The tub drained slowly each time I took a shower. The hospitality room door locks don't work well, and frequently won't accept your room card key. The continental breakfast is lame -- just crappy coffee, store-bought pastries cut in half, mini-donuts and dry white toast. The only good thing about this hotel is the free internet access in the hospitality room. I didn't have to lug my laptop with me to stay in touch. But the bar in the hotel has an internet cafe for a fee, so the free internet access isn't enough to make up for the dirty cheapness of this hotel.Do yourself a favor and pay a little more for a clean, nicer hotel.

Our stay at the Waikiki Sand Villa was the only disappointment. Their smallest rooms (around 70 per night) are indeed small. We upgraded to a ""suite"" for $95 and they are a bit larger w/kitchenette, but the carpet had stains and walls were marked up in areas. After looking at several rooms and staying in one, they were all dingy and somewhat dirty looking. The continental breakfast is just as others on this site have described. While walking around the city I noticed several restaurants offering low-cost breakfasts, so you really don't have to endure the nutritionally-deficient ""continental breakfasts"" that are offered at the Waikiki Sand Villa. Also, beware of the complimentary iron! I'd urge you to bring your own because it seemed difficult for staff to locate while we were there. I actually got one once during the end of my stay (we had to tip the housekeeper) and staff knocked on my door the next morning at 8 a.m. to get it back. At the end of the trip I had wished that we'd kept that tiny $70 a night room since we were in there so little of the time. My advice to first timers to Honolulu/Waikiki:1-Look at any on-line auction sites to get bargains for Hawaii. One is the Entertainment Book. This will save you a lot. 2-Use ""The Bus"" as much as possible. The locals can give great advice, but the only way that we got to meet many was by using the bus and waiting for the next one to arrive. You can get a 4 day pass at ABC stores or check out an online auction site. Also, the bus can be used when you leave the airport only if you carry one piece of luggage that can be placed on your lap and is convenient if you know where you are going and how to walk there. I'd do this if I go back, but first-timers might need more direction and taking a shuttle was helpful for us. 3-Purchase a good map and a book that will guide you on your trip, and do lots of research before you leave.4-Many locals shop at Aloha Stadium for souvenirs. You can save quite a bit by doing so and it is within walking distance of Pearl Harbor.Have fun on your trip!","Rosedale, California","Stay20724</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rosedale, California</strong>",13,2.0

First I have to say that if it were not for JASON at the front desk I feel the trip may have been different. He worked with us over the phone beating the internet price. And then when we decided to extend our stay by 2 days he got us a room at the same rate when only the night before the girl working the front desk looked at me as if I were crazy for even asking to stay. She said no room no way no how. She didn't even have to look at the computer she just knew. Anyway she was an obvious idiot and Jason hooked us up in the morning apologizing for his ditsy co-worker. The only draw back is the $10 parking fee in addition to the room rate. But the staff is very friendly. The breakfast is free and consists of donuts and toast. The rooms were very clean, the A/C is weak but the room is just fine.

Buget Hotel but clean, staff is exceptional and has amenities such as lovely pool, game room, fun internet bar. We arrived Thursday, June 2. Our first day was to just hang out and get over jet lag. We visited the beach and ate lunch at Lu Lu's on the beach. Day two we booked a trip to Sea Life Park and did the Dolphin Discover. It was very fun and there was quite a bit of interaction with our dolphin. On Sunday my son talked me into Extreme Parasailing..it was very windy which made the trip 1,000 feet up a little more than interesting. Monday we rented a car for two days and drove through Oahu up to the Dole Pinapple Plantation, the Falls, and on to the Resort at Turtle Bay for Lunch. We had to get back to go to the Luau at the Royal Hawaiian Resort. It was great, well organized and the show was very entertaining. A young tahitian girl asked my son on stage to dance...at first he was shy, then really got into it. On our walk back we noticed Waikiki at night is very interesting with many people watching opportunities. Tuesday, we drove to the south of Oahu and up the coast to the Polynisian Cultural Center. We didn't stay for the show since we were getting pretty exhausted and needed to get the car back. On Wednesday, we spent the day at the beach (bring lots of sun screen!!). Wednesday night we had a trip on the Fun Bottom Fishing tour. Fishing was slow but they did a great job of making sure everyone had a good time. Waikiki at night is beautiful from an ocean view. Thursday, we wanted to do something that would take up most of the day since our plane left at 8:30. Absolutely don't miss snorkling. Most people went to the bay close by but i hear of way too many people. We booked our trip with Captain Bob's. This had to have been the best time we have ever had here. They take you to a sand bar where you can practice snorkling or play s and volley ball in knee high water. on the way there we had many opportunites to see the sea turtles surface to take a look at us. We were then served lunch on the boat and moved on to the reef where we saw so many fish by the beautiful reef. My son and I got a rare opportunity to see a Morey Eel swim by and go into the rocks. Hawaii has so much to offer and going with an open mind makes the trip memorable. We booked all but one tour through Alohatopten and everything went off without any problems at all. All tours picked us up and dropped us off at our hotel or one that was within 2 blocks from our hotel.

I enjoyed the Sand Bar, with its staff of interesting people. I met quite a few locals who told me a lot about Hawaii and made me feel very confortable.  The Pool was cold, and the hot tub warm.

Both are owned by AI Hotels or Principle Hotels – oddly, both names are in use at the properties. BEWARE of purchasing a room from this hotel group through a package such as Travelocity, Expedia, or an airline. The hotel was overbooked, selling more rooms than they actually had, and the people who bought a package deal (from Expedia, Travelocity, or Qantas, apparently) were the first to go.We were moved to the Sand Villa and given an “upgrade.” Since the resulting room was a small, fairly standard motel-style room, I am afraid to know what the original room must have been like. The front desk at our original hotel told us that the Sand Villa was a nicer property (“It has a pool!”) and he promised us a suite. Because of the inconvenience, we requested and received free parking. Parking is valet-only. Cost is $9.50 per day (plus tip). We originally booked an ocean view room at the other hotel. At the Sand Villa, we got a corner room that faced away from the beach, to the Ala Wai Canal. This was NOT a suite. It did have a balcony that went around the corner, though. Two beds: one twin, one full-size double. No queen beds here…Because of problems with our room (defective internet, mostly) we switched to another room on a higher floor (but no longer in a corner). In the end, we made due with our room, but there were some frustrations.The pros:- The room was clean and housekeeping was fine.- The bathroom was small but nice enough.- There is a refrigerator in the room, which comes in handy. A Food Pantry supermarket is two blocks away on Kuhio Ave.- Apparently they will store baggage if you check out long before your flight.- They have a “hospitality room” with a bunch of computers hooked up to the internet.The cons:- Staff can’t seem to get their story straight. Promises, promises, little delivery. Some of the guys working the front desk are nice people, but not really customer-service savvy.- Street noise is a serious issue. Ala Wai Boulevard is a busy thoroughfare, and the traffic begins at 5am. This is the road that ambulances and fire trucks use to get around Waikiki quickly. Sirens aplenty. Motorcycles and mopeds are seemingly quite popular…- Hotel promises free in-room high-speed internet – but don’t count on functionality. Ours did not work. The jack was dead. Also: They don’t provide a cable, just a jack. Be sure to bring your own cables, if you get a working jack. We informed the hotel of the problem immediately after check-in. They promised us someone would be right up. An hour later, no technician had appeared, but we left for dinner and informed the front desk. After dinner, still no fix. Finally, at 10pm, the maintenance person arrived to attempt to fix the problem, but couldn’t figure it out. This guy really didn’t understand anything about networking; he was really the hotel’s fix-it guy. - Insufficient soap. One single bar for both the sink and the shower/tub. They provide one small shampoo bottle, but nothing else. (Bring conditioner, and perhaps even soap!)- Breakfast is pretty poor. They have mini-donuts, danish, toast, watered-down pineapple juice, and coffee/tea. The birds seem to like the breakfast area, and they’re not shy, but we can hardly blame the hotel for that… ;) - Safe in room was missing its key. Would have been a nice feature.- Fitness room “is not yet operational.” Sure.Overall, it was an okay stay, and would have been better if we hadn’t been jerked around by the hotel group’s management.","Los Angeles, California","kmbmea</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",199,2.0

The shower was wonderful having lots of pressure and not just a trickle like many higher priced hotels. For the long evenings there were about 30 television channels. The in-suite fridge was also a real plus. We were charged for the room safe but the peace of mind was well worth the few dollars. The free Internet in the bar area was a nice touch and allowed us to keep up with email from family. having a limited amount of time kept us from staying on to longDuring the time we were there the one elevator was being redone and so having only one elevator for a 12 story hotel meant for some long waits at times but we survived and it was a good way to meet other guests.The pool area was lovely and was never crowded. The chairs at poolside were older and had seen better days but we again managed and had great tans to show for it.The hotel is in a great location next to the canal which has a nice quiet walkway and also close to the shops and restaurants. A large grocery store is a block away and was very handy. a block to the ’Bus’ and close to the marketplace but tucked away as not to be as busy as hotels right close to the beach. Yet if you wanted the beach it was about a 3 block walk.I think it comes down to what you pay for is what you get so if you are looking for a 5 star hotel then do not stay at the Sand Villa.

Ok.....the place is not the Hyatt so don't expect the Hyatt when you get there!! The rooms were clean and I felt safe there. The pool was nice and large. They offer a free continental breakfast but as others have stated, its not that great. It consists of powdered donuts, donut holes, fruit danishes and toast. You also have a choice of tea, coffee or juice(pineapple i think). Our room was on the 4th floor and had a partial view of the canal. We were going to upgrade to a higher room if we found it too noisy, but to be honest, the hum of the air conditioning drowned out most street noise so we stayed on the 4th. We had asked for a non-smoking room with a queen bed but got a smoking room with a king bed. It didn't smell of smoke at all so that was o.k. The bar in the lobby is fine and offers good happy hour specials and the free internet is great. The laundry room is kind of dingy but most people probably won't be there long enough to use it. The reception staff were o.k, Not overly friendly but we had very few dealings with them anyway. All in all, the hotel is fine and you really aren't there all that much. There are much nicer hotels but they are also alot more expensive. The location to the beach is about 3 blocks and it'll only take you about 5 minutes to walk there. I would probably not stay there again but only because I would probably want to try somewhere different next time(this was our first time in hawaii) .

On our 1st vacation, we just went to the Isle of Oahu with plane tickets, and the rest was by chance. We had surfed the I-net for hotels out this way, and found the Sand Villa to be the best priced hotel. We took ""The Bus"" (Another 5* event as well!) from the airport into Waikiki, and walked the 2 blocks to the hotel. We were greeted with kindness and joy. When it came to the negotiations for our room, we found the price to be quite risky indeed! I flipped on my charm, and diplomatic charisma and haggled my room down to $62.50 per night from $86.00! We were impressed. The staff there is very reliable, as it was the 1st time I brought my full armada of computer assy's with me anywhere. Nothing was ever missing from our room! That really impressed me, as I had a fortune in computer assy's with me. Our most memorable encounter was with the bar tender, geez, forgot his name, young, slim, and 5' 8"", blond... anyways, he is the best drink mixer on the island in my eyes! Try their Lava Flow! That's what I'm going back for! Anyways, right at the bar, ther is a bank of computers that our family was on. You just have to request a 1 hr coupon. So we surfed the net further about Waikiki and the island right from the bar, as well as kept in touch with family back home here in Canada! Our main focus with this hotel was not to stay there for our full vacation, but to use it just as a place to lay our bones to rest. We hoofed it all throughout Waikiki for 2 weeks, and found that the car rental we had was just a shear waste of money! There is no place to park a car, and the stalls are too narrow when you we able to find a spot to park. So this time we are going to use ""The Bus"" for 100% of our touring of the island. You can go anywhere around the island for only $1.00! Now that's value! I was able to create a beautifyul CD-Rom of my vacation, and my goal this time is to make a disc 2 CD-Rom of our vacation in only half the time!So if it value for the money, ensure that you are able to book the Waikiki Sand Villa for your vacation to the Isle of Oahu! Well worth the stay!Oh, did I mention that the pool is nearly always vacant, the morning breakfast is simple, but very filling, the front dest assistance is second to none! and they will even hold your luggage AFTER you check out of your room, such as this time our flight departs HNL @ 2225, so from 1200 - 1900, we will be able to take in the sun and fun with no room, but with the piece of mind that our luggage will be safe and secure with the front desk.

The hotel is a very clean and well kept place. The floor we stayed on (the 9th) the carpet wasn’t worn or soiled. The room was clean and made up everyday. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There was some confusion on the parking for Expedia customers. First they told me that if you booked on the internet you didn’t have to pay, but later they called me in the room saying they had made a mistake and I would have to after all. But I forgot to go down and pay so I never did. The parking area was really tight and hard to maneuver in. The refrigerator in the room didn’t work in the room; I was going to switch rooms but we never had anything to put in it. The breakfast wasn’t that bad. Yes, all it consisted of some assorted doughnuts, toast, some Danishes, coffee, juice, and tea but it was free. We thought the pool was great. The pool was surrounded by a variety tropical plants and trees which made for a nice backdrop. The hot tub was nice too. No problems with the A/C, shower, or towels. The hotel is only like a five minute walk from the beach and is in walking distance to many restaurants and shopping centers. A pretty nice view could be seen from the balcony in the room. Internet in the lobby isn’t free but you get 30 minutes if you buy a drink. Overall the hotel isn’t quiet a three star but was good enough for the price and for somewhere to stay. Nobody goings to Hawaii to stay in the hotel room all day anyway. ","Tacoma, WA","shaunk2455</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tacoma, WA</strong>",3,3.0

We knew we would be out and about, so we didn't mind paying a little less for a hotel, since we wouldn't be in it often. I have been planning this trip for a year. We couldn't afford a 5 star hotel, but we wanted at least a 3 star. The Waikiki was not only 3 stars(at the time), but it had really good reviews prior to us booking our trip. We arrived late on April 22, 2004. My husband was informed that since we booked our trip through expedia, we would not receive free parking, even though that was someting that was told on the website. i was a little upset. We get to the parking lot and there is no where to park. We go back upstairs and are told to just double park and leave your keys at the front desk. The last time I check I don't know those people let alone what kind of drivers they are. As mentioned in an earlier review, the are car scraps on everything. our room has stains everywhere, the toilet seat is broken on one side. We are given a room with a full size bed as well as a twin, when asked why this was done, that was all that was left. Even though I booked and paid for my trip 4 months ago.

I e-mailed to confirm the free internet/breakfast/parking/local call deal prior to us arriving there for our honeymoon. I also asked if it was available - an upgrade (i was hoping for a corner suite that everyone had previously reviewed). I got an email back saying they would do their best to get us an upgraded room - but since i was booking through expedia - it was partially out of their hands. Well since they did not tell me that the other offers did not apply to me i assumed it must be ok. Well i get there and they wanted to charge me for a week of parking right away - i very politely told them that i was under the impression that it was included and very shortly i was told that ""not for expedia customers"". I told them i e-mailed about it - and the girl at the front went to the back to talk to the manager - came back - went back to the back - came back again - and asked me for the e-mail printed off. I did not bring it of course because I thought i wouldnt need it - iemailed the reservation manager directly.The girl then grugenly said ""well then i guess we have to honour it"" gave me a slip - i aplogized for not printing the paper and we were on our way. We parked in the - yes very small and awkard - lot. Went up to our room in the shambled of an elevator they had - down the hall of torn/warped carpet and banged up walls - to our room to find that our safe was not complementary as told as well.My husband went down to talk to the hotel staff - because i was tired of dealing with them by now - taking 20 minutes to check in. When he comes back they informed me that they found the e-mail and in no where in the e-mail is word of the free specials - we need to pay for everything that was supposed to be included.So i hesitenely went back down stairs to chat with them. I absolutely hate having to stir the pot - but here i went. After talking to the girl at the desk and the manager i realized that they were purposely not understanding what i was saying. I repeated myself 5 times - showing the parts of the e-mail that said these things - and they just said ""you booked with expedia - those are not expedia deals"". They didn't even answer my questions on why - just saying over and over ""you booked with expedia"" and also saying ""so you are demanding these things? you cant have them"". I was getting quite upset at this point. They informed us we got an upgrade to a superior room already - thats a bonus og 15 dollars a night - which basically included a twin bed in the room - so they were not going to do anything else. My husband asked for a comprromise - for us to meet half way. They pretended they didnt understand that and just said ""would it make you happy if we comp;d your safe"". By this point we just took it and left to our rooms.I was quite frusturated by this - but i decided it wouldnt ruin my trip. The rest of the time there was pretty uneventful except for the crews and constructions on the outside of the building with a lot of noise. Oh also our air conditioner worked half the time and was reset to subzero by the maid daily (talk about top quality service). The shower head fell down on our heads every time we showered (i should of asked for another room but i was not ready to deal with management again.the sheets were dirty when we arrive with other peoples hair and crumbs in it. The sheet smelled old old - like the room wasnt used in ages - saved for special expedia customers.The pillows are super thin - you need at least 2 of them to sleep.the drywall was falling down, water stain on the ceiling of the room, tiles had a lot of mould in them, and tiny rooms.The breakfast was powder juice, coffee ( i didnt try) and powdered/plain donuts. Cheap with flies buzzing and landing all over it.nope - dont recommend it - even to a buget traveler. I have stayed 4 times in waikiki - the ohana waikiki surf and ohana west were MILES above this hotel and not to mention closer (barely) to the beach. Miramar is a nice hotel too - but i didnt feel like spending that much money (110 US a night)Hope this helps!","Calgary, Alberta","OnAir38025</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Alberta</strong>",12,2.0

But the room is so small that it's hard to even get our baby stroller in and the parking is the worst possible. Every day for 6 nights we had to double park and leave our key at the front desk. The parking lot is sooo small that you see lots of car scrapes on the walls. The rooms really need a makeover and the sheets and towels are so old they should be thrown away. We weren't told about the free daily breakfast so we never tried it. The internet access is located int he Bar which is super smoky and stinky...1/2 the time the computers were ""down"" which was a real bummer. We were depending on them to use for directions, etc. On their website they say if you stay 4 or more nights you can get a Aloha Dining card...however, when I asked for it the girl said it's only if you book thru the hotel website...otherwise it doesn't matter if you stay a month. I'd say the best think about the hotel is if you buy a drink at the Bar and ask, they'll give you 2 tickets to the Honolulu zoo. (It's advertised on the hotel tv channel, not advertised in the bar.)

I can tell you from personal experience that the Sand Villa is a real value. I've personally stayed there twice, and my parents (who aer VERY picky) stayed there for 10 nights and LOVED it! Here is the rundown:1) Free parking--will save you money! As others have mentioned, the parking garage is VERY small and not for the faint of heart. A bit annoying, but a money saver.2) Good location--Block and a half from the international marketplace, and 3 or 4 blocks from the beach.3) FREE internet! HOok up in the room, or use the computers in the lobby *bar*4) Great happy hour specials--cheap drinks and food, albeit amongst some *ahem* interesting clientele!

I have stayed at my range of hotels from bare bones Motel 6 in Carlsbad, CA to the Kea Lani in Maui. For the price this hotel delivers. You get free parking which is otherwise about $8 per day. You also get some coupon book if you book 4 days. The book has good deals on food if you are two people or more bec there is a lot of 2 for 1's. Anyway, my expectations weren't high, I knew the carpet was worn, etc. but I wanted the free high speed in the room and a nice pool. The pool is nice, not heated so it was cold in January. There was sun on the deck from at least 10am - 4pm. There is a hot tub too. Breakfast was convenience style packaged powered donuts. A definite miss. There were toasting bread one day and had jam. The parking garage is under the hotel and is made for small cars with good turning radiuses. I did see mini-vans down there but there are pillars to dodge and I needed to do 8 point turns to get my mid-size chevy breeze out sometimes. The lot fills at night and you have to double park and leave your keys at the desk. Other than that the parking was a plus in that area of town. It took me 7 minutes to walk to the beach and that includes getting stopped at two stop lights. Very easy walk. I was never a beach person but since the pool was so cold I ventured out and got a $3.00 raft that the store inflated and enjoyed the ocean. It was warm, the sand was great. --The first room I got (a corner) seemed ok, it was clean. Upon further inspection, the shower head was mounted in a way that did not allow you to move it so it shot straight down. Then the air conditioning did not work. The pillows were a bit flat but lets face it - it is not a a five star. At first I chalked it up the ""you get what you pay for"" but the second day it was just too hot in the room. I got another room on the 10th floor and it was so much better! Great shower, good air, it even looked newer. I was told that my new floor was a no smoking floor. The hallway carpet is more worn on all floors than the carpet in the rooms - who cares, you don't live in the hallway. The hotel was redeemed. Lesson - if you don't like your room change it right away, call ahead and ask the hotel to check the room for a good working shower, clean smells, and air conditioning. Really, call, that is what the front desk told me to do for my next visit. Have some check your room. I had no trouble with the noise but given it is on a busy corner people who have noise issues may want a room away from the street or up high.-- While I was there, for the benefit of my posting back to this list, I asked to see one of the Pualeilani Studios. They were much bigger with a kitchenette and table, sofa, and a bigger bathroom. If you need the space it is nice. A fridge would be great. There are no elevators so it might not be fun on the higher floors if you don't like the hike. The hotel also has a hospitality room which I check out. It is great if you arrive early or have a late flight. There are two full bathrooms, with towels, etc if you want to take a shower, there are couches, a big tv, internet access, it seemed like the size of two hotel rooms - great if you need a place to hang or change. There are washers and dryers (for a small fee) if you need to wash clothes. The laundry room seemed clean and acceptable when I peeked in. I did not eat at the hotel but there were clusters of Sand Villa groupies enjoying the food. There is a pool table, bar, and computers in the lobby to use. The bar has a big screen TV and people were hanging out there too. I had a corner room which was looking at the canal and it was very pretty. - The hotel staff was helpful but I didn't learn anyone's name. They responded to my requests. I even had to e-mail after I left bec I forgot my receipt and they mailed me one right away. There is an activity desk but I didn't use it. I am going back in February because buy the time my fourth day came I knew my way around, had a better room, a place to park, high speed internet in my room that just worked when I plugged my network cable in (they have some at the desk).

We enjoyed sitting out on the balcony, sipping Mai Tais, and watching the canoes go by (and the traffic was kinda fun to watch too, in a sick kinda way).They have a big, open-air lobby and the front desk staff was efficient, though overwhelmed at the time we were there with many Japanese tourists staying there. They also provide a continental breakfast, which was fairly sparse (toast and danishes) but served the purpose. There is a small pool with nice landscaping around it, but I imagine the sun that hits it was rather limited as it was tucked between the hotel and an adjacent taller building.One other nice benefit of this hotel is that they have their own parking garage underneath (parking in Waikiki is always tough to come by) and we were always able to find a spot there. (Don't try bringing in a big SUV or van, though; it's pretty tight under there).There is a cybercafe/bar in the lobby which looked pretty modern and offered free internet access on their computers to guests, although I never tried it since my goal was to get away from reality for awhile!","Denver, Colorado","SFcatamount</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",98,3.0

Was somewhat disappointed when I first arrived with the age of the hotel and some of the furnishings -- somewhat worn and overall the building was not in tip-top shape. But the room was clean, the bed comfortable, and the service adequate. All the plumbing and fixtures worked well (except the shower massage, which did not fit in the holder and sprayed all over when the water was on!). The little fridge came in handy -- there is a Pantry supermarket a block away and the location is pretty good given the price (only a short few blocks walk to the heart of Waikiki Beach, which is where you want to be.) The view of the mountains from the small balcony was stunning - I never slept better. I will return for my second trip unless I can find a better value at one of the Ohana or other similar resort names that abound in the area even closer to the beach, but probably would be tough to find for the same price. Overall, not bad.","Orlando, Florida","toddalex4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",21,2.0

It certainly won't be our last and the Sand Villa Hotel played a large part in the enjoyment of our trip. We had booked online and got awesome prices - so good we wondered what might be wrong with the place. There was nothing wrong with it and lots right!! Fantastic value for money. We had a tower room on a corner with two lanais. The hotel is central to Waikiki and while it isn't super fancy, the place is clean, well-run by a friendly staff and the rooms are very nice. Free parking too and a great pool in case you get tired of the ocean! We'll definitely be staying there again and are recommending it to our friends.","Saskatchewan, Canada","Janis W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saskatchewan, Canada</strong>",27,5.0

If you want your room smelling like cigarettes when you've requested a non smoking room, thin worn out towels, old rickety furniture, wind whipping thru the windows, stained walls, torn carpets in the room and hallways, complimentary breakfast (which includes warm coffee in a styrofoam cup, half of a donut, half of a muffin, on a paper plate, and a glass of orange tang), this is the place to stay. Checked in @ 5 p.m., had a shower, checked out by 8 p.m.... spent the other 14 days of our vacation at the Sheraton down the street.

It was a great place to returm to and relax after a busy day sightseeing and creating memories to last a lifetime. It was the perfect spot for a romantic honeymoon. Our second trip back was even more special as ""our"" place welcomed us with open arms. The beautiful views, the lovely rest periods by the best pool in Waikiki (in my opinion) and of course the quietness to be able to relax.By my third visit I wantet to shate the experience of this sereme place with someone else special in my life, my mother. Bringing her here she experience a special time and got to see what I was always reminiscing about. I've made a believer out of her as she often recalls the special times that we spent together talking by the pool and sitting on our lanai sipping fruity drinks. One day she would like to return and would not rest her weary head any place else.As my husband and I return in a few months for the fourth time for our 10th wedding anniversary I hope that ""our"" special place still holds true to us. We want to relax, remember and renew our memories that we created on our visits We both know that we can do that here.We've often entertained the idea of staying elsewhere on our next visit, but the charm, charisma and quietness draws us back. It is truly ""our"" place and home away from home. We recommend staying at the Wakiki Sand Villa any time we find out that anyone is travelling to Oahu. The wonderfule views, the great rooms, the serene setting by the pool makes you feel like your on your own desserted island, not in a busy city. Overalll it's a great place to stay, to get away from the busy stresses of life and to retreat into your very own paradise.","Edmonton, Alberta, Canada","Tourist2409</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Alberta, Canada</strong>",2,5.0

Got a room that smelled a bit of old cigarettes when we had asked for a non-smoking room, but overall was really happy with the hotel, it was clean and the pool was great. The internet cafe in the lobby was a great added bonus. I am booking myself in again this year actually!","Vancouver, Canada","Stay23141</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",0,3.0
