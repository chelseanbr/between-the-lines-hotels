Many newer resorts have more to offer. But as timeshare trades go, this place was fine. We could walk to all the Waikiki spots. March had plenty of tropical rain and thunderstorms. Staff was polite and helpful. (our stay coincided with the beginning of the pandemic) My only complaint would be the $20- a day parking. We skipped parking by doing daily car rentals (Hertz is on site) every other day.

The best feature was the Island Deli in the back of the ABC store. Do check it out.The bad. Had a room on the 4th floor facing a parking garage and the roar of it's large ventilation fans. The bathroom was tiny and hasn't been updated in many years. Judging by the layout this 1 bdrom unit may have been 2 motel units at one time. The living (?) area had a murpfy bed, dresser, couch, dining table w/4 chairs and a kitchenette. A lack of outlets and desk required me to move the dining table to the murpfy bed area in order to work on my computer.Stayed here 2 weeks as a timeshare exchange. Maybe that is why I got a lower class room. Due to flight changes I needed one extra day lodging. Front desk quoted me an owners rate for that pathetic room of $210 for one night. Could have booked online for $150. Decided to go elsewhere. Thermostat for each rm was old style and difficult to find a sweet spot for temp.This place brags that it is close to Waikiki Beach. Maybe if you could fly over the other hotels. In reality there is a bit of a walk.

Its only plus is its location 5 minutes from the beach. Just note that the beach is sandy until you get into the water where there are pieces of sharp coral rock and large slippery stones. We tried out the roof-top pool, but when the wind comes up you can feel the building move so we did not feel safe.

We exchanged a week of timeshare to stay at The Imperial Hawaii Resort. The foyer is clean and welcoming. The lady attending the front desk, going on midnight, was excellent!! She was kind, informative and very friendly. We felt very welcomed, even at such a late hour, and after a full day of travel! We booked a one bedroom with living room, which is fairly roomy, clean and comfortable, except the bathroom is small. We were cold the first night. Our room thermometer said 60 F. We tried to bring it up to 68, but it stayed 60 all night. So, sure missed our home comforter...they have only sheets/thin blanket for bedding. We are used to heavier bed covers! The air was turned too low...we will have to figure it out, so we are not cold through the night. We love that there is a Denny’s on site!! We had a good breakfast there this morning. And, it is always a plus to have an ABC’s store near. There is one just off the foyer. Additionally, we love access to the 26th floor as timeshare owners! Our room has a fridge, microwave, toaster and coffeemaker. No stove; but, we are allowed to use the stove on the 26th floor. There is a small, warm pool on the roof top, along with lounge chars. On the 3rd floor is a sauna, jacuzzi, fitness room and laundry. Today, we found all the staff we came in contact with very welcoming. We will miss having our own stove in our room, as we do like to make a few meals on our own. There are no BBQ units.

We also did not get the rooms reserved but went ahead and opted for the larger room as it was only$80.00 more for a 6 night stay. The rooms are much smaller than they appear on the website but seriously, who goes here to stay in the room??? The pool area was smaller than we expected but was never crowded and has a fantastic view. There is an ABC store attached which is very convenient. There is also a Denny's. We enjoyed the free lei making in the lobby. The staff were all friendly and helpful. We were given a tour (by chance) of the owners lounge. What a view!! Shopping and the beach are so convenient. On the down side, we apparently had termites in one of the bathrooms. The view from our room was partial Oceanview and the parking garage. Our daughter had a beautiful Oceanview.

The location is fantastic. In the heart of Waikiki, steps to the beach and plenty of restaurants and shops, many high end. Everyone we met who was staying there was unbelievably nice. The unit was updated a bit but not fully. The kitchen was new and bathroom sink but the shower looked about 25 years old and the wallpaper was peeling in spots. Strange that they would go to the effort and not do the whole thing. The two negatives are significant. The unit had two outdoor patios that looked out on a parking garage. It was noisy and not attractive to say the least and made the unit very dark. Didn’t feel like we were in Hawaii until we left the unit. Lastly and probably the worst was our terrible reception when we arrived. This was a timeshare exchange that my sister gave me for my birthday. We didn’t do an official transfer, didn’t know we needed to. When you’ve been on a 12 hour flight, the last thing you need is trouble checking in. They were so unhelpful but finally agreed to give us a room if we paid for it. And it took three conversations to get the charges removed. We shouldn’t have been charged at all since this was a timeshare! I would up calling my sister late at night because of the time change to confirm she was giving me the unit but they wouldn’t speak to her. Wanted her to fax - is it 1983? - her ID with a signed letter giving her permission. After much wrangling, they agreed to an email from her, as long as it was clear that it was her email address with a photo ID. Seriously? Needless to say, it soured our stay. Not everyone is going to have this experience but it doesn’t take much of an effort to treat your guests well. Make them feel welcome, not like scammers.

They never shut off, nor did they ever manage to cool the unit below about 75 degrees. And they were loud, though luckily I’m not a light sleeper. My only other complaint—having stayed in both studio and 1-bedroom units is that the floor plans seem more cramped than they should within the space that’s there, but that goes back to their original design flaws.

The lanai was small - of no real use except fresh air. 5 minutes walk to a small beach. Sandy entry into the ocean. Cold showers are at that beach and you can rinse your feet again when you get to the back door of the hotel. The laundry was great - many washers and dryers. A large table for folding afterwards. It is also open air on one side with views to the ocean - so lovely to sit and wait if you so chose. The room was clean with a full kitchen. I slept on the Murphy bed - was surprised how easy it was to pull it down and put away - bedding stayed in place. I did find it firm to sleep on - I requested something to soften it - and housekeeping arranged egg cup foam layer. Problem resolved. The kitchen did lack counter space so that made it difficult to cook. Simple meals will work fine - we like home cooked food. We managed. The pool is on the rooftop - basic rectangle. It was enjoyed by other guests. There is a good exercise room - I needed it to keep up shoulder exercises. Wifi and DVD player were good.

Most of whom have been here for years. Don't let the opening statement fool you, the employees are focused on the hospitality experience. Helpful, cheerful, and friendly. from the bell desk to the front desk you will feel and come to know Ohana.We have come to know of the resort because my father is a vacation share owner. (just to get that out for disclosure) which is how we discovered the Imperial, but we have stayed there as a regular guest ( when dad wanted both weeks those years) the experience did not change.They are doing regular renovations and updating. this happens over time, but there is a chance for some of the appliances to seem dated. Last year the pool was renovated. We have not had a problem with things not functioning, but if that happens they is on-site maintenance to correct problems. To the amenities; The pool is on the roof. the fitness area Gym, sauna, 2 hot tubes are on the 3rd floor. there is a full laundry on the second floor with sets of machines (i think 3-5). the concierge can handle excursions, car rentals and tours. There are computers and printers for checking travel arrangements or self-help event verification.There are a few different room types that are well detailed in the booking site. we have always had access to a full size fridge with freezer; stove; microwave; and dinnerware and flatware service for at least 4 people.Some of the rooms can seem a little odd with the arrangement of the furniture placement compared to the floor plan. Best recommendation when you arrive, figure out the sleeping arrangement (will you use the hide-a-bed or murphy bed) and set the room for sleeping. then see how best to re-arrange the furniture. once done put the beds away, unpack and start vacationing.From the imperial is is a short walk to most anywhere. if you have trouble walking, check with the bell desk they can get an electric scooter delivered.(and most everything else. those people rock) south a half block and you're in the water.

East of the hotel is Waikiki and Diamond head (but there are a few buildings in the way) there is not a direct route, but if you enjoy exploring there are some great shortcuts to be found.",California,"MARK H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",28,4.0

Pool area was clean but the pool very small. Housekeeping is only on certain days and they will tell you that if you ask for new or additional towels etc. In the end you can take your used towels to housekeeping and they will count them and replace then with clean. So, this is not a hotel where you will have housekeeping everyday, although they do get the trash. The 23rd floor smells horrible. A/C is ancient.

I've stayed in this condo 2 other times with my husband so a Murphy bed studio really wasn't that big of a deal. This time it was me and a friend so I got a one bedroom that sleeps six if sharing beds but, I had my very spacious room and my friend got the Murphy bed in the living room.

The living room was a spacious size and the balcony had a little table and 2 chairs to sit out on. The location is pretty much right in the middle of everything. The kings court very high end shopping and the beach walk shopping center. It's a mile walk to the zoo and just down a path yo the beach. You dont even have to cross the street to get there.

We knew about the $$ for Valet parking, but honestly, most hotels downtown charge, and the convenience of pulling in and not worrying about parking was pretty satisfying. The beds were not extremely comfortable, but the room was great. For a suite, the bathroom was incredibly tiny, but it got the job done, and the kitchenette was adequate and helpful. The pool on the top of the hotel was great, and made for a fun visit. However, be prepared to wait for the elevators! The co-location of an ABC store next door was pretty awesome (Dole Whip!) The nighttime noise was a bit excessive, but it was the 4th of July so there were plenty of drunks and loud cars about (they were there at the fireworks shows and just continued drinking, so I couldn't expect much else)",Utah,"TrvlFamilyMan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Utah</strong>",19,5.0

We arrived early and the hotel was able to check us in right away with a hotel room on the 26th floor which included an amazing view. The staff were kind and very courteous. Ty Gurney Surf Shop is on the same block, so we rented surfboards for the week from them and the hotel also had a surf locker for the boards which was very helpful. The bellmen were also very accommodating when we needed to get the boards out which was several times a day. Room: we were in a suite with a separate bedroom, one pull out sofa, and a pull down bed. Bathroom was small but functional. View, as mentioned before, amazing. You could easily watch the Friday night fireworks from the balcony. Location: Also amazing- you won't get a real resort vibe here, but the location is in the middle of high end, upscale shops. And lots of them! The ABC store underneath the hotel is more than just a package store. You can get beer/wine, but also a grocery store, and restaurant. There is a Longs Drug Store right around the corner for anything else you might need. Food: Yard House for Happy Hour, Duke's for the lunch buffet, and farmer's markets for dinner. Loved the variety and local foods you could get at the markets as there was something for everyone at very reasonable prices. Activities: We tried to stay out of the sun during the hot part of the day. There is a move theater about 2 miles away, but highly suggest renting a car to get out of the city to the North Shore one day and another to visit the Kualoa Ranch and Polynesian Cultural Center. I think our favorite thing was hiking Koko Head Crater which is hard both going up and coming down, so plan accordingly. We didn't see young children or too many older people hiking this- it's too strenuous. There are 1200+ rail road ties up the mountain, no paved walkway, or handrails. It took us 1.5 hours round-trip, but our boys made it in half that time. At night, there are also street performers on the main strip. The hotel was reasonably priced and very well located.

You never see everything you want your first trip, so it took two times to make it right. It's been 16 years since I last visited when I took a half-day city tour that included the U.S.S. Arizona and the Punch Bowl. When a friend of mine who is native Hawaiian heard where I was staying he said, ""You've got to get out of Waikiki man,"" so he took me to Tantalus nearby, the North Shore, Turtle Bay and a fine coffee stand. Though I took a bike ride my first time to Diamond Head, I got there at 5 pm which is closing time, so this time I got there in the morning. The guide books say allow 2 hours and that's just about right. It's great excercise and has fantastic views all around. I took the bus which picks you up close to the Imperial Hawaii Resort and drops you at the entrance to Diamond Head. I really spent very little time driving in Honolulu. I also took an all day island tour that stops at Hanauma Bay, the Blow Hole, a macadamia store, Kualoa Ranch and the Dole Plantation. What I liked about the Imperial Hawaii Resort is that it has a roof top pool with fantastic views & is a few minutes walk from Waikiki Beach, so I swam in the pool and the ocean every day, starting off with a soak in their hot tubs on the 3rd floor. They also have a nice excercise room and laundry on the 2nd floor. I enjoy photography so I requested an upper level room in their 27 story high rise & wound up on the 24th floor, which was pretty nice. No matter where your room is though, you have that view from the roof top pool.

You are literally a block and a half off Waikiki Beach. Heck, if we could have we would have pitched a tent in a park to be that close. We couldn't, so the Imperial was our 2nd choice. The beach was everything it was hyped up to be. Packed with people, and of course, the Pacific ocean. Wonderful x 1000.The staff at the Imperial were amazing. Anything we wanted or needed they told us where we could find it or they found it for us. Case in point - golf club rentals. Look no further than the concierge desk. Food? Denny's downstairs or the ABC store (largest one in Honolulu apparently) right under the hotel. The only thing they didn't have was a wireless mouse (I know, what the heck am I bringing a computer to Hawaii for, right?)The Imperial also does time shares. Those that participate, get access to the owner's lounge which is about half of the 26th floor. Great place to cook family meals and have a sit down with 10 of your closest friends. Or a great vantage point from which to watch the weekly Friday night fireworks at the Hilton just down the beach.Now the not so good. The place is dated. Everything from the carpets to the beds. We had a Murphy bed that you pull down from the wall, sleep on it and then put it away. I thought, why bother putting it away. Cuz for one, the washroom door won't open all the way. And for two, the wooden skirt on the Murphy bed goes all the way down to toe level, but not all the way to the ground. I walked into that skirt at least two times to massive pain and cursing until I finally got the message that it was better up and tucked away into the wall than hanging around waiting to ambush my big toe again. The shower head was barely hanging from the wall and there is absolutely no venting in the washroom. So smells and humidity hang around for some time after use.Parking was decent at $18USD a night. Ice was only to be found on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Towels were changed daily. You could even use their towels for the beach. Beach chairs were a fraction of the price that beach vendors rented their chairs out at.Otherwise, a safe, clean and hospitable place to stay.

And you walk out to really nice shops and restaurants and the street is lined with tiki torches. Really pretty at night. But honestly, all of Waikiki is like this. Very tourist friendly. Oh and around the corner from this location is a 24hr longs drugs (owned by CVS). And if you're doing any attractions that requires a pickup, we found that lot of them will pick up at Outrigger Reef, which is literally right across/corner from Imperial. Lewers Street dead ends at another resort, and next to this resort is Outrigger Reef, which also has a Starbucks attached to it. There's 2 SB's within minutes from this resort if that's your thing.

Vanity space is limited and counter space in the efficiency kitchen does not exist. But we had everything we needed. (Milk in the ABC store was $11 per gallon and a half gallon if ice cream was $12.

I hesitate to call this a budget hotel but relative to the hotels on Waikiki Beach it was inexpensive. Ultimately though the price reflects its good location and middling amenities so I would say the price is fair for what you get. My friend and I were in a modestly sized studio that had a Murphy bed, pull out sofa bed, and kitchenette. Like many vacationers in Waikiki we didn't spend a lot of time in the room but it was adequate for our needs. Our 3rd floor room faced another building so there was no view but it would be unfair to penalize the hotel for this because I purposely did not select the more expensive room options which presumably do have city or beach views. The rooftop pool is decent but not so great that one would necessarily prefer lounging there versus the beach, unless you're just feeling lazy, which tends to happen on vacation. The staff (front desk and valet) was very friendly so definitely no complaints about personnel. Another plus about the hotel's location is that it's above a large ABC Store, which I learned is ubiquitous in Waikiki, and directly across the street from a town center with a number of restaurants and shops -- though I should point out that there is no scarcity of restaurants and shops anywhere in Waikiki! The resort/amenity fee was $8 per day which is low compared to other hotels I considered but, again, I think it accurately reflects the modest scale and scope of amenities that the hotel offers. Overall it was a good hotel for our purposes and I recommend it to people who who want to be in the middle of the action but not spend a lot of money on lodging.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Robert C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",6,3.0

We had a 1 bedroom with 2 full baths, full kitchen, balcony, lr, and 2 flat screens with dvrs. Full size bed (also common in HI). You cannot beat the location which is close to everything. Buses are available if you want to go outside the downtown area. We rented a car, but only used it twice during our week stay. No onsite restaurant but Denny's is downstairs (food was not great so go to a local place). Rooftop pool, owner's lounge (if you are a timeshare owner) bar, fitness center, hot tub and sauna. ABC discount convenience/souvenir store is downstairs and open until 1 am. We did not hear any noise once in our room (706), corner room with view of other highrise hotels.","Willingboro, New Jersey","prettybrowneyes83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Willingboro, New Jersey</strong>",28,4.0

At the end of Lewers Street just across the road from Waikiki Beach, diagonally across from Roy's Waikiki Beach restaurant, within a couple of minutes walk of trolley stops and bus stops, this hotel really is unbeatable in terms of value and location. We had an amazing view from our room. For those on a super tight budget, there are cooking facilities in the room or food trucks in Beach Walk on the site of the old Hawaiiana Hotel (such a shame that was demolished) which can stretch the budget further.Our last visit here in December 2013/January 2014. The lobby has been renovated and there is now a dedicated computer for guests use which is a huge improvement. I miss the Hawaiian retro decor in the lobby but the lobby is bright now and the room we stayed here had still retained that Hawaiian retro vibe which I love. We didn't notice street noise this time either. The staff too this time were all very friendly and gracious. This hotel really is unbeatable value in Waikiki.","Sydney, Australia","tropicgirl39</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",168,5.0

Let's start with the good. What's good (or even great) is the location of this property. It's at the bottom of Lewers st Waikiki across the road from the Halekulani, and it's literally a 5 minute walk out the back door of the hotel to be standing on beautiful Waikiki beach! For the cost of staying at this property (e.g. roughly 1/3 to 1/4 of Halekulani) it's outstanding value and for the versatility of having apartment style accommodation you'll find it hard to beat. There's an ABC Deli store on the ground floor, as well as a Denny's restaurant, and Lewers st is littered with places to shop and eat catering to just about all budgets. There's fast wi-fi (covered by a negligible daily resort-fee) that works great. We even streamed HD movies using it and had no trouble at all. All the staff are terrific, friendly and accommodating with nothing being too much trouble (tipping aside) and everyone we met (guests included) are just the happiest and friendliest people you could ever hope to come across. I guess Hawaii is just a happy place. Housekeeping is great with an endless supply of beach, pool and bathroom towels. The room gets a full service twice a week, and the trash taken daily. The housekeeping lady who looked after us was terrific and the room was spotless (I wished I'd remembered to leave a tip for her!)Moving to what's OK. The parking is ok, although expensive at $150 per week, so it was over $300 plus tips for our stay. It's valet parking only, but you can go in and out as many times as you like, and the valet service is super quick and worth the tip. Considering where you are in the middle of Waikiki it's reasonable to pay that much. The decor in the room is ok but very dated. I understand there's some renovation happening in the place but the room we were in hadn't been renovated so it was a bit ""tired"". Nonetheless it was very comfortable with two queen beds in the bedroom and a ""murphy"" pull-down bed in the living room that our son slept on. The beds were all super-comfortable, including the pull-down. There’s also two bathrooms, and additionally a small kitchen located in the main living area.There’s a pool on the roof which is OK although it's a little barren up there and could do with some greenery as there's little else there other than the pool and some chairs / lounges. The beach is much nicer.So that leaves what wasn't good, which was the noise.We were in the noisiest room I have ever had the displeasure the stay in. The room was on level 9 facing out onto Helumoa Rd at the rear of the property. This road services the hotel, the Waikiki Parc Hotel next door, the Waikiki Sheraton car park, and the Waikiki Trolley and bus services, as well as the rear back alleys to all the hotels and shops along Lewers St. The noise starts just before 4.am with delivery trucks to the Parc hotel, the ABC shop, and other properties along the back alley. Then there's the garbage trucks picking up all the dumpsters, which is followed by even more delivery trucks. By about 6.am (if you've managed to get back to sleep) the busses start picking up tour passengers, and the limo drivers pull in waiting for jobs (I got to hear every conversation the limo drivers had, and some of them were quite colourful). The Sheraton car-park begins to fill up around this time as the cars race around to find the best spots. The bus arrivals and departures will be pretty much continuous by now, arriving and reversing out again until around just before 9am, which is when the Waikiki Trolley kicks off with one every 10 minutes. Trust me you wouldn't believe the noise! Yes all the windows were closed, and the drapes drawn, but it made no difference as the windows are so old and worn out they may as well be wide open. On the first two nights I was lucky to get four to five hours sleep. The only reprieve was that the Monday after we arrived was a public holiday, so there were no deliveries that day. Bliss!I spoke to the front-desk, who referred me to the reservations team who were nice and accepting of the problem, but could do nothing to help as the place was full (like the rest of Waikiki in January). In desperation I headed to Lowes Hardware and purchased a large roll of heavy duty duct-tape which I used to seal up the edges of the windows in the bedroom. That helped reduced the morning din by at least half and allowed me to get some sleep (and retain my sanity) for the next two weeks. Is there nothing duct-tape can't do?I'd give this property 5 stars as a great value family vacation destination, if it weren't for that noise. If you can get a room on a high floor, or perhaps a renovated room, it might be worth the risk. If you can't get that guaranteed I'd recommend to pay a little more and stay somewhere else.","Melbourne, Australia","MichaelBTraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",32,2.0

The decor was a little dated and the TV was an early model 40"" LCD with an external DVD player and no additional input ports. So leave your Firestick at home. The central air is cold and loud. The noise is a plus for those who like to sleep to mechanical humming sounds like me. That said, the room was clean and comfortable. Besides, you're in Hawaii so who really cares about the room as long as it has a bed, a shower and is cleaner than that room in Manila. Am I right?!Parking is available for $25 a day or $100 for a week. It is valet only due to limited parking but since you are paying up front for the parking, tipping really is optional. I did drop a twenty at the end of my stay for the kind and prompt service.What ever you do, do not waste your time and money at the restaurant downstairs. There are so many good dining and takeout options within 5 minutes in any direction from the hotel that you would most certainly be doing yourself a disservice. One of the best things about Hawaii is the variety of local grinds. One of my favorite places was a lot of food trucks one street west of the hotel. A little prices but the food is really tasty. My advice is takeout and eat back in the room. You can buy your drinks and dessert downstairs in the ABC store.I don't want to make this review too long winded so I'll get to the good stuff. The best thing about this hotel besides the 2 jacuzzis, the sauna, and the rooftop mini pool from the 70's has to be the relative close proximity to the beach and everything else in Waikiki. If you're gonna lounge around on the beach and swim a little, I recommend bypassing the beaches in front of the Halekulani and Reef and walk to the beach area in front of the Hale Koa and Hilton. This area of the beach has more sand and surf, and less coral and rocks. Also, there's less of a crowd. The same water activity rentals are available there as anywhere else. Do yourself a favor and rent an umbrella and two chairs for 2 hours for $25, $15 with a military ID.Our vacation was filled with nothing but eating, drinking, relaxing and slow walking to get it all in. If this is what you want in a Waikiki vacation too, then what I recommend is for you. Aloha!

The price was very competitive compared with other local hotels. My room was clean and comfortable. It was quiet and I sincerely enjoyed the outside sitting area. It was great to have weights in addition to cardio machines, in the gym; and while I didn't use it, I'm sure the pool and sauna were nice. The valet was very personable and made sure my car was right up front at 5 am when I left for work. The bad:I had to stand in the lobby for a long time waiting to be checked in and didn't feel particularly welcomed. While standing in line - there were 3 or 4 of us waiting - the cleaning woman asked us to move twice (once to the right and once to the left) so she could sweep under our feet. I was shocked to find my bed was a hide-away tucked into the closet. The ugly: Traffic. Traffic was absolutely horrible. Unlike others, I was in Waikiki on business. If I were on vacation and just wanted to hang on the beach, it likely would have been fine. A very short walk from the beach and tons of stores/restaurants right across the road. As a business traveler though, both my mornings and afternoons were spent trying to navigate vehicular but also phenomenal pedestrian traffic. The valet area is not clearly marked and I went around the block twice before pulling into the Post Office and calling them for instructions.","Gretna, Nebraska","DebbieHatch</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gretna, Nebraska</strong>",73,4.0

We had a Palm room which is a 1 bedroom 2 bathroom unit with 2 Queen beds in the bedroom and a pull down Murphy bed in the lounge. Ours was on the 14th floor with a peep of the sea from our small balcony. The unit was self contained with a fridge, microwave and full stove/oven. As others have said it is expensive to eat in Hawaii so being able to prepare some meals was a bonus. The air conditioning in our unit worked very well to keep us cool but was very noisy, however we got used to it over the week! All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially the car valet staff who fetched our vehicle whenever we needed it. Whilst the car parking is expensive $135 for the week, the convenience was worth it and being able to drive up and down the coast to visit other gorgeous beaches, swim with the turtles, surf, walk Diamond Head, visit the Waikele Outlet shopping centre etc was great. For all of this the BEST thing about this hotel is most definitely the LOCATION, it is literally a 5 minute walk to Waikiki Beach, and is surrounded by shops, retaurants and bars. Whilst it is an older property (currently being upgraded) it is priced accordingly and we felt it was excellent value.

Naturally, I was a little concerned. However, I'm happy to say that this place was very nice and we had a great time. First, the valet service guys were great, very fast, always ready to take your car and bring it up to you. The Front Desk people were all very friendly and ready to help you in any way possible. The Lobby appears to have had some renovations done and it looks great, very clean and modern looking. The room we were in was a one bedroom, two bath, with a full kitchen. The good thing was that the kitchen, although a little small, had brand new appliances, stove, microwave, fridge, and dishwasher. It didn't have most of the amenities that we usually get at some other time shares we stay at, but it was enough for me to make breakfast, lunch, and dinner and same a lot $$$$$$ from having to keep eat out. The rooms are a bit dated, and could certainly use some upgrades such as carpet, shower, and even furniture, but it was fine and we had a decent view of the ocean. If the renovations continue as they appear too be, I'm sure the rooms are going to be awesome in a few years. Also, as has been said this place is literally in the middle of everything, shops, restaurants, beach, etc. The rooftop pool was also nice, looks recently renovated, and, at least, while we were there wasn't very crowded. So, overall, I would definitely come back and would highly recommend this resort if you are planning a trip to Oahu.","Montebello, California","Oconaf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montebello, California</strong>",15,4.0

As many recent reviewers have said, the place is undergoing renovation in the common areas, so we encountered some noise, elevators not working, pool closed for a couple days, and the owner's lounge closed for several days. All of these things were not enough to ruin our stay. We were quite annoyed when we first checked in and were assigned a room on the 19th floor and before we were given our keys our desk clerk was told to give us a different room. He was instructed to tell us that the room had been taken out of service just then. Then we observed the other desk clerk give that room number to another guest standing beside us. We were then given a room on a lower floor. Very disappointing to be lied to. Our clerk tried to make it right so we waited for a room on a higher level (15th) floor so no view, and he comped our parking fee for the week. I'm very glad we kept the paperwork, because at check out, the parking had not been removed from our bill.The rooms are adequate for a week at Waikiki. Our first room had no real cooking capability except for a toaster and coffee maker and microwave. We tend to do breakfast and some lunches in our room when traveling on our timeshares so this was just enough to have breakfast and sandwiches for lunch. Hawaii is very expensive so doing a few meals in helps that cost. Our second room had a full stove so we went to the grocery store by car and made several evening meals in our room as well. The ABC store adjacent to the Imperial has much of what you need for quick meals and drinks, alcohol, snacks, and sundries.There are no king beds at the Imperial so we had queen beds each week. It is still very tight to get around the beds in the bedroom. There was also a Murphy bed in each living room but we didn't need them. A family would be able to make it work but another couple might find it very small. Our first week we had ceiling fans in the living room and bedroom which were important because the air conditioning did not keep the room cool enough. Our second week the room didn't have ceiling fans and we knew it would be brutal. I called the desk and they sent two box fans right up to us. They made all the difference, especially for sleeping.Waikiki beach is just one block away and the Imperial rents beach chairs and coolers on wheels so you can make a day of it on the beach. I recommend getting the chairs, very comfortable, and the cooler to keep drinks cold. Their cost is $10.00 for the day and to rent at Waikiki it was at least $50 for two lounge chairs but you also got an umbrella. I bought a small beach umbrella at the ABC store and used that... The sun is brutal. Watch out for wind because it will send your umbrella flying and turn it inside out!We would recommend the Imperial for a timeshare exchange or a regular vacation rental. It is not beach front, views are limited, it is not plush with turn down service and pillow mints. However, it is priced accordingly, most of the staff (especially bell service) are attentive and friendly and aim to please, and it offers some kitchen options to save a few bucks.","Bangor, Maine","debonvine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangor, Maine</strong>",160,3.0

There were a few projects happening while we were staying here. The lobby was being redone and check in was on the second floor, one of three elevators was shut down which caused long waits for an elevator and sometimes they were very full, they were replacing fire doors which was very loud. The pool opened while we were there after being closed for remodeling for a couple of months. Even with all the noise and inconvenience of the construction we enjoyed our stay. The location is perfect, only a block from the beach and shopping and restaurants are right outside the door. We used the hot tubs which are located on the third floor and the laundry facilities are useful on the second floor, washer is $1.75, dryer is $1.25 and soap is $.75. The pool is located on 27th floor and the remodeled pool deck and pool are great. It can get a little chilly because the wind is blowing constantly so grab your towel quick once you get done swimming.  The staff was always very friendly and helpful. We rented a cooler and beach chairs from the front desk a couple of times during our stay and the equipment was always clean and in good shape. The cooler was $5/day and the chairs were $3.50/day. The free wifi was pretty fast and reliable, they must have upgraded this because we have stayed here before and the wifi used to be very slow. Valet only parking is $25/day. We had two adults and three teens staying in a Palm room. This was a one bedroom with a Murphy bed and a pull out couch. It was a little cramped for the five of us but we really didn't spend too much time in the room. We had a small kitchen with a small refrigerator. The room was a little run down but they are going to be getting new carpeting and repainting the rooms in the future. The owner's lounge on the 26th floor is very nice, the view is amazing. It's a great spot to watch the Hilton Hawaiian Village fireworks every Friday night. Our flight from Hawaii was at 9 pm, the hotel held our luggage, let us park our car for the day and gave us a key for the owner's lounge so we could hang out there if we wanted.

This hotel has 27 floors and is a good place to stop over when in Waikiki. The rooms are small but comfortable. We had the Banyan Suite which has one bedroom with a queen size bed with TV on the wall. The main room has a wall bed and a fold out bed that is the lounge chair. This room has cable tv as well. There is a small microwave, bar fridge and crockery and cutlery as well as an assortment of glasses. We were located in 2505 on the 25th floor and be aware it is noisy on this side of the building (East Side) as the hotel next to it has their service entrance. It is not a big issue but do be aware you will have to live with noise if you sit on the Lanai. From the Lanai you get a partial ocean view which is nice. The in-house restaurant is Denny's and I have heard some poor reviews of the place but to be honest we had no issues at all with the meals, service or cleanliness. We ate there 4 mornings in a row and one dinner time. Just outside the lobby is an ABC store where you can stock up on food, alcohol and other items.There are a myriad of restaurants in the area you can go to or you can get take out. One tip for you is Giovanni Pastrami down the road offer discount prices for takeout if you order delivery and the Round Table Pizza in their restaurant is good. The Kalua Pig Supreme is a must. Washing facilities are available on the second floor with a quarter machine if you need change. They have a TV there to while away the boredom of waiting for your washing. There is also an ice machine there too.Overall this is an ok place to rest your head when you are in Waikiki.",Port Hedland,"mwpcschris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port Hedland</strong>",9,4.0

The room was clean even though the furnitures looked old. Before my booking, I called for room size. I was told it would be 350 sqft. I measured my family room to have an idea. But I did not feel the room was that large. We later moved to Aston Beach Hotel. Their room should have been 250 sqft. But we felt the room at Imperial was probably even smaller than the Aston's. I wondered whether they counted the balcony into the room size. Anyway, it was fine for 4 of us. They had one pull down bed and one pullout from the couch. Enough for good sleep. But with those in place, barely enough room to move around for TV, light kitchen, and dining table, etc. Air condition wasn't quiet and not so effective. Fortunately it was windy, cloudy, rainy, and not so hot when we were there. But we felt the ineffectiveness on one day since we felt very slow for it to cool down when we came back.The location was good. We could have a little bit view, between buildings, of the beach far away when we stood on the balcony. It was in walking distance from the beach. I would say about two blocks or just go through the hotel along the beach. Restaurants, shopping, convenience stores were all around. VERY convenient. No room service during our stay. But we could go to the 3rd floor to get new towels and beach towels. Coin operated laundry on site which was important for us. No self parking nearby and we only had valet parking on site.

Moreover, some of the rooms are very good, but you have to be careful when booking or exchanging because there is a huge difference in the types of suites, aside from which floor it is on and whether it has an ocean view. There are three types of one-bedroom suites: 1) The Banyan, 2) The Palm, and 3) The Koa. Try to avoid the Banyan. It is the smallest and I felt quite cramped staying there. The bedroom is so tiny that the bed takes up most of the room. If you need to use a second bed, there is a Murphy bed in the living room, but again, the room is so small that it consumes most of the space. The kitchen in the Banyan is a ""mini-kitchen"" with a small fridge, microwave, sink, and a few cabinets. There is one bathroom in the Banyan.The next step up is the Palm. It is still rather small, but it has a second bathroom and doesn't feel as confining. The kitchen is also larger. The best suite by far is the Koa. It feels spacious and is a very comfortable size if you are spending a week. When you walk into the Koa you feel like you are walking into a real apartment rather than an overstuffed hotel room. The Koa has a full kitchen and two bathrooms. The bedroom is much larger than in the other suites, with room to move around.

The staff were very helpful which we found was simply Hawaiian/American folk in general. Our room was 1 bdrm, 2 bathroom. The ensuite shower didn't work but that didn't matter as we just used the 2nd bathroom. It was a shower over bath in 2nd bathroom which would be great if you have kids. Laundry facilities were good and convenient, as was the daily attendance to clearing of rubbish from our unit. The pool was really small but the deck chairs / loungers and space was good. Not too busy when we used it.Our view was absolutely breathtaking. We had a corner unit on the 23rd floor which looked straight out to the ocean.

The ""resort"" is in need a total rehab, but the location can't be beat. The only thing that can make the location better would be to move it on the ocean! The points needed to trade here thru RCI are a bit high & it's because of the location That being said, you are in Waikiki & who really stays in their room?The Imperial is located next to the ""Rodeo Drive"" of Waikiki. Many nice shops & restaurants nearby. The location is very safe to walk around at night. We had a 1BR unit, the Palm, with 2 baths that slept 6 people. The unit actually had 3 beds. The 4 of us had plenty of room to sleep. The living room area & kitchen are small, but like I said, you're in Waikiki who really is there for their room. Our room faced the back, not much of a view but we were on the 14th floor & if you look over the balcony you do get a slight view of the ocean.The staff was friendly & accommodating. We had 2 separate units, our 2nd week was only 1 BR, 1 BA & we paid $100 upgrade to stay in the same unit for our duration, giving us more space.We ate at Taormina Restaurant & it was excellent. There is a nearby coffee shop for coffee & also we ate breakfast 3 times at Giovanni Pastrami. If you're looking for a night to save money for dinner, try the Food Court in the nearby shopping center, past PF Changs on the 2nd floor. Sometimes you need to save with kids! If the opportunity came again & I could go to Hawaii, I would stay here again, just because the location is so great. Like I said, you're in Waikiki. There is an ABC store downstairs that is convenient for anything you may need. The rooftop pool is small, but nice after the beach. We only used it twice.",,MissJJ,110,3.0

As it was in the same price range and distance to where my actual work had to be performed.It is within a 7-8 minute walk to the beach. Though it took me a day or so to get my bearings and realize the beach isn’t actually Waikiki but more like the Fort DeRussy Beach Park. Though a 20 minute stroll up the beach would get you to Waikiki Beach proper, with that said I found the Ft Dempsey Beach area plenty adequate for Hawaiian beach activities like - swimming, sunning and boogie boarding.The staff was friendly and effective. One can ONLY valet park. They ought to have a sign that states this as I drove up and could not figure out how to park and I personally don’t care for the idea of tipping someone to “park my car for me”. (Just a personal preference.) Though I can understand it here, as at one point I found myself in the parking garage and the cars were parked VERY close to each other.Also, there were plenty of unexpected charges for this room: $25.00/day parking (ok big city parking I get that..), $6.00/ day resort fee (?), internet was $15.00 / day (I think), and maybe another fee I can’t think of at the moment, and of course taxes on all those fees. So there was quite some difference between the final bill and the online reservation. Still, I think this hotel came in well under the price point of the nearby locations.That all said, the valet staff was friendly and efficient and the hotel lobby/grounds were clean and well maintained. My actual room was large, had an equipped and functional kitchenette, sleeper sofa, a murphy bed, two flat screens (one in the living room and one in the bedroom), the bathroom had a shower only, and there was a small balcony with a stunning view of a parking garage (though this did not confront me – who travels to Hawaii to sit in their room?) and the bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel only cleans the room like 2X/week, so keep yourself tidy cause no one will clean up after you.I also discovered that if one ventures toward the strip there’s a mall in that concrete mess and a full-blown food court that offers a wide selection of fare and price points. The shops also range from high end stuff to gimmicky tourist trinkets.I read some of the reviews and the biggest complaint I saw was how reviewers thought the over place was dated. To be honest, I felt a little of that but also realized the immense value: its clean and functional, the location was superb and the price point has to be well-below the neighbors. So if/when the renovations are completed to satisfy the “dated” reviews I expect the price point to no longer be an effective edge.Other notables: there was plenty of walking destinations – the strip for example that have multiple shops and bars/restaurants, an onsite ABC store which carries just about everything one would want to get or need (there is another ABC store a short walk up the strip and was considerably less crowded), the rooftop pool offered some commanding views and the kids in that pool weren’t concerned about the wind at all (compared to other reviewers), an onsite Denny’s (though I did not eat there).Upshot: I liked this hotel and would stay again","Denver, Colorado","funtobeme</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",149,5.0

Which is around the last time it was updated. I personally kind of enjoyed the vacation time-travel, but I'm weird that way. The rooms were clean, no problem there. The pool and hot tub also seemed clean. There were just spots where it was obvious that no updating had occurred and a bit shabby looking, like the thermostat from the 1960s and the wall patching job in the bathroom that was not painted over. However, this is a pretty good deal considering you are a block away from the beach in a very expensive area. There were some renovations going on that I think if I remember correctly will be ongoing through September. Also, there was a pretty loud street fight that occurred Friday evening that woke me right up. Not the fault of the hotel at all, but if you are facing the street, you might get that on a weekend. It is a party/tourist central location and there are lots of homeless people who camp out at the beach near the Army museum under a covered picnic area, which is a couple of blocks from the hotel, so be aware of that. Most are just sadly down on their luck, but a few appear to be a little drunk and disorderly, so exercise some caution in that area if you are heading to the beach. (Honolulu overall has a terrible problem with homelessness, which you can see now and then as you drive around.) Overall, the hotel was not bad, lots of shopping and restaurants to choose from. It was nice to have the option of keeping some cereal, coffee and milk on hand in the kitchenette for a quick breakfast. There is an ABC Store ( I LOVE that place) next to the lobby that opens from 6AM until midnight that has everything, pretty much, except (oddly) for nail brushes to clean under your nails. The hotel could make their valet parking area a little more obvious. It wasn't really clear and you have to enter at a diagonal, kind of, on Don Ho Street, and tourists aren't aware that cars go in and out there, so be careful. You MUST use the valet parking and there is a charge for it. There's a Denny's in the hotel, but we didn't eat there.","Brooklyn, New York","Michelle B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",27,3.0

There were to a of people from everywhere. And some were celebrating graduation. We booked 2 rooms at the imperial. It is very spacious and more than enough room for the 3 of us. The only problems was there were no pots in the unit. We had to rent out everything. Pay for valet parking since there is no where to park. The street it sits on is a one way street, so if you passed by it you'd have to go all the way around again through all of that traffic. Don't loose any towels or anything, otherwise they would charge you for it. And if you needed extra towels or blankets or pillows you'd have to rent them about. And return them so you won't get charged. The ABC store downstairs is a plus. Just in case you want to get food to eat already made. They also have a Denny's below too. We never got to experience the housekeeping service since we only stayed 3 nights. But we did notice that someone took our trash the first day we stayed.

Location:Great location in the centre of Waikiki - a few minutes 100-yards walk to the beach.The hotel is literally surrounded by other high-rise hotels (there are over 120 resorts/hotels within about 1/2 a mile of the beach, therefore most feel more like being in a city than in a resort).There was (and will continue to be for several months) some street construction right in front and on the sides of the hotel. The noise was supposed to start around 8AM according to the notices provided, but they were at it from 6:30AM.Facilities:Although a daily $6 resort fee was charged, don't kid yourself, this is not a resort. It is simply a well located, dated high-rise that promotes itself as a resort with no additional facilities that a decent hotel offers.The roof-top pool is practically unusable due to consistent high winds, lack of shade spots, and poor views due to ugly high cement walls. A coin operated guest laundry room is available on the 2nd floor.As seen everywhere in Waikiki, your can enter an ABC convenience store within a dozen steps from the lobby. We also had a few good breakfasts a the renovated Denny's restaurant on the first floor.The bus depot is a short walk to the Sheraton parking next door. This was convenient since most of our day trip excursions use that parking as their departure/arrival location.Room:Considering the overall ratings on Trip Advisor, we were all kind of shocked at how dated the rooms were (we had a total of 3 suites booked - all suffering from extremely dated flooring, furniture, decor, layout, poor appliances, (you get the idea)...The suites had in-room safes, but were awkward to use, being placed in the bottom of a closet.The kitchen has nothing more that a (very) small bar fridge, an old microwave/convection oven combination from a few generations ago and a couple of stove top elements. The cupboards were sufficiently stocked with pots/pans, dishes and cutlery.Both bath rooms were minuscule and in desperate need of an update - showing their obvious age. Service:Room cleanup is twice a week, but in our experience, a very quick clean up only (sand on a bathroom tile when we arrived was still there when we left as were fingerprints in the patio door and windows. Trash pickup was done every other day. Front desk and concierge services were excellent.OVERALL:The price and location are good, but I would not return here and would not recommend it until such time as a major reno is completed.","Ottawa, Canada","Andre F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",68,2.0

The bed was only a full size, so I slept in a murphy bed in the living room area. A very strange configuration was where the bathroom was in conjunction to the bedroom. It was situated off of the living room away from the bedroom. And, the bathroom was smaller than one we had on a cruise.

Arriving from the airport by taxi was pricey as we later found out the speedishuttle was cheaper. Check in was easy and the staff was friendly.We found our unit was ocean side and had a good view of the water and sunset. We were not expecting to have a view of the beach itself because we knew the resort was a bit away from the beach. Our unit was very clean, tastefully decorated and well kept. We didn't use the pool in the resort because, hey, there is a beach just a short walk away. Coming back from the beach, the Imperial has a foot wash station in the back that we used before returning to our room. We rented a car for a day and parking of our rental car was valet only at the resort. That was okay since the vehicles are parked in the lower levels of the building.The Imperial is located central to Waikiki Beach and is a very short walk to the beach or the main shopping strip. This was a big plus to us. Getting to the beach was a bit confusing at first but once we had our bearing, we learned of the many ways between buildings to get there. There is a small store on the main floor that provides a bit of everything to get you started on your vacation. Taking a car to a local grocery or department store will see lower prices but if you don't want the hassle, then the store will do the trick.On the 27th floor, we went to the lounge for happy hour. It is only open a couple of times during the week so make sure you check before going. The view on this floor is very nice and if you get there in time for sunset, you can enjoy a drink while watching the sun go down. The staff there was nice and provided a relaxing atmosphere.Without reading previous reviews, it would not have been known that this resort is one of the older ones.

We stayed in two types of rooms during our stay (one bath and a two bath). Overall this is not a hotel we would stay at again. I'll start with the positives.Location is great. The beach is a short walk away. We wound up walking a bit further to the beach than other people because the stretch of beach this resort is closest to is not great for swimming. Lots of rocks and such, but its only another 5 minutes and you are in front of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel (pink building) that had a wonderful place to enjoy the water. The location is right by all the stores and restaurants. You do not necessarily need to rent a car since it is right where the action is. The more expensive restaurants are right in the area. If you are looking for deals on meals you will have to walk about 15 or so. We did find a reasonable place to have breakfast across the street. The convenient store and Denny's is right next to the hotel.Desk staff and trip planners were very friendly. They helped with many excursions and advice on where to go and what to see and do. They did an excellent job on helping pick out adventures for us to take or good places to eat. Always friendly and always helpful. This was a great location to venture out from. Waikiki area has the best weather on the island and in this hotel you are right in the middle of a fantastic beach. Waters were great for swimming. Location location location. The not so great...The rooms are somewhat outdated in style.The bathrooms were very small. The beds were too soft with some bad springs and the bedding was not comfortable. This hotel is in need of rennovation. In the bathroom, well, I only weigh about 175 and had to sit sideways on the bowl to fit into the room - enuff said.There is quite a bit of noise outside this hotel. We stayed on the 5th floor for the first leg of our trip and were awoken to many sounds of garbage trucks, street noise, construction and the like. On the second leg of our stay we requested a room on a higher floor. We were assigned a room on the 15th floor and did not hear any street noise. Ants - Exterminators come in weekly to this hotel and we had an ant problem as well during our stay. Parking 20 dollars a day - no free parking anywhere in the area.So overall we had an excellent time in Hawaii and weren't expecting a lot from the hotel. We were happy enough to find helpful people and a good location to use as a base for our adventures. The staff was very helpful in planning our stay. Other than the location and staff this hotel does not have much else to offer. I'd like to think you can do better elsewhere if you are looking for more comforts in your hotel.","Newtown, Pennsylvania","Dansreviewofthis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newtown, Pennsylvania</strong>",21,3.0

Partly because we could transfer our week from a timeshare and also because of its central location in Waikiki. I'm glad to say that the experience was a little better. Here are some notes from our recent stay, good AND bad:1) Valet service is ALWAYS top notch. Those guys are super cool!2) The room we got this time was only a 1-bedroom. Be wary that not all rooms will have a full kitchen. We had a fridge, sink, and microwave this time, but no stove.3) The ABC Store is now done with the remodeling. It is huge! But, since it's very close to the beach and on the way to Kalakaua Ave, it'll get really busy, too. Also to note, the store has a deli where you can get ready-to-eat food. Very convenient if you don't have the stove.4) The front desk staff is average. Certain individuals are decent, but some won't even smile. Being that it's the first, and maybe only, interaction you have with your hotel guests, it's a good idea to at least put up a front and pretend you like your job.5) They now have wi-fi in each room. You still have to pay for internet access, but it's fairly cheap. Only $25 for the week.6) For the most part, the rooms are clean. It's up to you to keep it that way during your stay as this is not like a Vegas hotel where housekeeping comes every day. They only come once or twice a week.7) Just like in the 2-bedroom suite we had before, the bathrooms are extremely small.All in all, a better stay.

The hot tub is on the 3rd floor and under a roof so it is protected from wind and rain but there is no view and is inconvenient to get to. The staff has always been friendly and helpful.

Just a block away from the beach you can easily walk to Waikiki for the day however because you are not directly on the beach the price is incredibly reasonable.

I was invited to stay at their time share -- The Imperial Hawaii Resort and it was fabulous!The Imperial is less than a 15 min drive from the airport (without traffic). It's situated in the heart of it all and Lewers Street is just off the main strip, Kalakaua Avenue (with all the shops (Coach, Michael Kors, etc.) and restaurants) but has nice shops, bars and an outdoor concert area itself. So having that convenience nearby made it even better! In the morning, you could just wake up and go downstairs for breakfast (a popular Denny's is in the lobby and one of Hawaii's popular ABC Stores- it's like a 7-11, beer/wine store, tourist shop and CVS/Walgreens all in one!) or you could walk outside and take your pick of restaurants. The beach is right across the street (we had a balcony view) with breathtaking views.The Imperial staff were really nice and the tour representatives in the lobby helped us make reservations for jet skiing, a Luau, Pearl Harbor, scuba diving, and Kualoa Ranch (where Lost and parts of Jurassic Park were filmed -- we took the 2 hour ATV tour, so worth it!!). The rooms were comfy (two beds and two baths --recently upgraded). The room also had a full kitchen so we bought a few groceries and cooked a few times. Housekeeping came by on Monday and Thursdays to clean the rooms but you could always call down to the front desk if you needed extra towels or something. We also had a rental car and the valet service was excellent. They'd quickly get your car, help you with luggage or bags and park it for you. The Imperial also has a nice pool on the roof and fitness room. The pool isn't that big but it's a nice size for the building which is quiet and has a private feel.

The rooms are comfortable, but most are on the small side and the furnishings, for the most part, are dated. (How much time do you expect to spend in your room and is this important to you?) TV and DVD players in both the bedroom and main living area, though DVD rental is not available at the Imperial.

This was the 3rd stay for me at the Imperial and I choose it because of the location and proximity to shops and all transportation options for tours etc. The size of the suite was great and our only issue was the AC. We were saved by having somewhat decent AC in the bedroom so we could sleep and we were given extra fans, but the living room was not working at all which resulted in a warm room with all drapes kept closed. A KOA suite is a corner unit and the natural light is great in that unit. We had a couple overcast days which helped in keeping the unit somewhat bearable if we were there through the day at all. We had relatives staying in the Outrigger across the street so it was a handy place to be for us to get together and on a couple warmer afternoons we hit their place after a few hours on the beach..This was my Dtr's first stay in Waikiki and she had no complaints. The ABC is a perfect place for great snacks and Starbucks is close by and of course the shops.The Imperial is showing its age and up for some renovations which include AC so I was happy to hear that. The owner's lounge is awesome and we did spend some time up at the rooftop pool however most of our time was at the beach. We took shuttles to the Outlets and we walked to the mall.The Manager was apologetic for the ongoing AC issue and even sent up cookies and juice when it was known that there was not much that could be done about this particular unit. Other than that issue the place is great, the staff are great and helpful whenever possible. I know I will be back again to enjoy a great week in Waikiki. Mahalo to the great staff! Miss you all and hope to be back soon.",Kelowna BC,"oree</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kelowna BC</strong>",70,4.0

We got the timeshare from someone, so we got ""owners privileges"". Basically it means the owners lounge with a balcony, hot tubs, you can view the fireworks from the 26th floor (owner's lounge) or the 27th, the pool which is on the roof. The pool is nice. The hot tubs are awesome and they have 2 of them. 1 is indoors and 1 is outdoors but on the same floor. They came in handy since I ended up getting hurt in Hawaii by 3 huge waves with undertow and was hurting.1st off I loved our stay. This is the exact type of resort I like. So for my gf and I it was perfect. I do not like maid service daily. Housekeeping comes in 2x's a week to do full cleaning and be sure you have nothing on your beds or they will not touch anything. Good to know. On our scheduled day for cleaning it felt nice to walk into a freshly cleaned room but again this isn't anything I need everyday. However, everyday they do come in and empty the garbage whether you put up a privacy card or not in the slot of your room.The timeshare was for a studio at a decent price. We had no intention of staying in our room except to sleep anyway after all we are in Hawaii on vacation. We were on the 20th floor which was great and made our stay that much better. So we had 1 pull down bed and the sofa bed. Now if you're thinking we weren't comfortable with those options...nope you're wrong. Both beds were comfortable and believe me I would have been miserable if they were not because I have fibromyalgia. I was real happy when I saw we had 4 various pillows to use because I use 3 to cushion myself at home. Turned out that for the 1st time in 3 years I was able to sleep flat and only needed 2 pillows. So that should tell you how comfortable I was and I slept on the sofa bed. I don't know how many of the rooms have a comfortable sofa bed but ours did. We had a kitchen with a convection microwave, toaster and coffee maker. From our room we could look down at the center of the street and see the people walking around and also had 2 areas of the ocean we could see. Loved it. Michelle and Dave at the front desk were extremely helpful and very caring because I got stung and bit by a fire ant. Michelle gave me the Dr. phone # and they pick you up at the condo and bring you back for free. I was unable to use it because the Drs. office wanted me to go to ER but that is another story. The point is the care I got was incredible. Dave looked at my foot a day or 2 later and said that's a fire ant sting. I said I know and it hurt. LOL Dave also gave us some options of where to go swimming safely and we truly had a good time. I pushed myself knowing we only had a couple days left and when we left I cried like a baby in front of all the valet guys. Oh well really didn't want to leave yet. Everyone we talked to at the condo was super pleasant. The valet guys are happy and uplifting and Paul went out of his way day 1 to comfort my gf who has anxiety if she doesn't have fast access to her car. They all fully understood and she was relaxed finally about valet parking. Now about valet parking...if you rent a car there is no way around paying the fee if you want to park at the resort itself. This is an additional fee not included in the room charge. Tipping is something that should be done. I did hear that you can park a couple blocks away for $15.00 per day and if you have no disability that is an option if you rent a car. We wanted to do our own thing our own way and needed a car. We didn't do any cruises or that this time around. We choose to go on adventures and we sure did. We wanted to really see the Island. Now the other option you have is not to rent a car at all. You will find options at the airport to get you to this resort. Once here you will see buses and trolleys going by every 5 minutes or so. If you are booking tours or boating excursions you can get picked up at the Imperial sometimes for free and other times for a fee. I suggest checking the cost of transport to the resort, to and from the events you book, and weighing the options of walking around and how far you can walk. The beach is closeby.Everyone is just so pleasant. Enjoyed new friends I met at the smoking area. Food your surrounded with good restaurants. This Denny's is great for breakfast. The ABC store has drinks and this one is one of the best with a full deli with fresh food, high quality at that. Delish. I intend on going back and met a couple I will get a week timeshare from. Can't wait. To all of you at Imperial, Mahalo!!!!! Miss you all. If you like Jewelry see Mae, work a deal. Sweet lady. For my gf and I it was a 5 star, for the sake of letting you all know it's not the Ritz I gave it a 4. If you need daily maid service etc., I give it a 4 for your benefit. They do have 1 and 2 bedroom suites also. Our studio even had a bathtub/shower. On timeshare WI-FI is free. LOVED STAYING HERE!

I own one unit that allows me to come every year, but I come from the East Coast of the US and that is a very long and expensive flight and a six hour time difference during daylight savings time. So just one week isn't really worth it. So, I take advantage of the Imperial's internal banking program which allows you to bank your week and use it up to 2 years later for a nominal fee of $75, so I can come for two weeks without having to deposit with RCI and spend over $200 and hope to be able to trade back in, or I can deposit 2 weeks and come for three for one airfare. I own several timeshares and this is the most liberal internal banking any of them offer.I own a studio, which as some reviewers have pointed out doesn't have a full kitchen, and is a bit small, but it is fine. It has a fridge, convection and microwave oven, toaster, blender, dishes, etc so you can make breakfast or other meals in the room. But sometimes I want to really cook, so I just go to the owner's lounge which has a full kitchen and make a meal there. The lounge is beautiful, with several tables, soft furniture, and the best view in Waikiki. No better place to watch the sunset or the fireworks on Friday nights. And it has free computers with internet access, a huge tv and dvd if you want to watch tv or movies, restrooms with showers if you have to check out early and have a late flight (they provide towels for the day and showers before you leave).One day, I went fishing and caught some Mahi and Opah, and made dinner for myself and several new friends I met in the owner's lounge. It was a highlight of the trip.I just don't understand some of the less favorable reviews. I own 8 timeshares, some gold crown, and many are fancier. Yes, the Imperial could use refurbishing and they have plans to do that, but I don't really care if they do or not. The rooms are very clean, the staff very friendly, they take out the trash for you most days, and provide maid service with fresh towels and linens every 4 days, or you can exchange them every day if you like at housekeeping. Best owner's lounge in the business. There is an excellent concierge service in the lobby for all your excursions, restaurant reservations, etc., and you can't beat this location. It is right in the middle of everything.I have been here two weeks, but unfortunately I have to leave tomorrow. Check out is 11:00 am, my flight is not til 10:15 pm, but I can spend another full day in Waikiki, they will store my luggage and give me a key to the owners lounge. Then, I can come back, shower and change, go to dinner, and enjoy the sunset from the owner's lounge before my shuttle picks me up at 7:30.I discovered some knew interesting (local) and inexpensive places to eat this trip and you can read my reviews on Tripadvisor. These are all local favorites with great food at cheap prices ($7-13 for a full meal). Diamondhead Market and Grill, a great Udon noodle place a few blocks away on Kuhio, Eggs and Things 2 blocks away on Saratoga, the café at Honolulu Museum of art, Little Village Noodle House in Chinatown, Nico's on Pier 38, Uncle's Seafood on Pier 38, Giovanni's Shrimp truck, Big T's shrimp truck, Hula Dog truck (all on the North Shore), Matsomotos Shave Ice, Happy Belly in Chinatown.You know, a resort should be a place to sleep and shower, unless you like the all inclusive thing, and your real vacation is what you make of visiting the local culture and haunts, and that is why I love this place. An inexpensive base camp with a lot of great people from all over the world from which to experience the best of what Oahu has to offer.So if you don't like it, stay somewhere else and pay what they charge.

That says a lot. The hotel is in a great location, as others have stated. So are about 100 other hotels though, all in the same area. So, if the locaiton can be duplicated, then the room has to mean something too.The room was small and ill-equiped. Very small. The partial kitchen? It had a fancy microwave and a mini fridge. So does every Holiday Inn Express I stay at, but they don't call it a partial kitchen. It had no stovetop. No oven. No dishwasher even to do dishes. I'm sorry, but I like the idea of using a dishwasher instead of doing dishes while on vacation. SHoot, it didn't even have a garbage disposal in the sink! It just ... ""didn't have"". One of the other things it didn't have was a bathroom in the bedroom. It was only a one bedroom, but I was fine with that. Our son stayed in the living room on the pull out bed. However, if we wanted to go to the bathroom at night, we had to leave the bedroom and walk past him to go the only bathroom in the unit. I can't think of the last time we didn't have a bathroom in the bedroom. in ANYunit we have stayed at. We are on vacation. We don't want to be walking past our 5 year old son on the way to the bathroom afterwards if we decide to be romantic in the bedroom (or just need to go bathroom.) I just didn't like the unit. Too small, not enough amenities, and that DOES count when other places have the same location benefit and much better rooms. I won't stay at the Imperial again. I WILL go back to Oahu again, but not the Imperial. that's an honest opinion.","Anthem, Arizona","gomeljohn9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anthem, Arizona</strong>",10,2.0

This year scored us a higher floor ..14 room 11. Room 11 is furthest from the beach and the last room on its floor so neighbours one side only.A warm arrival awaited & we were pleased to find our room ready early. 1411 had us facing the Embassy suites across the way again but also an ocean glimpse in between the 5 star Halekulani & theOutrigger Reef to the left. Views up Lewers St the right. Again a decent size lounge/ diner/ kitchen, which we noted had been updated compared to last years room. Better counter top finishes in the bathrooms & kitchen. Stove, fridge &micro Newer carpet & fresher wall paint throughout. Sofa bed, pull down bed, dining table, single wardrobe with safe all in the lounge room. This room had a marginally different room layout to last years. The bedroom door had "" shifted"" making the bedroom an awkward room . It only left just enough room each side for a double bed. No space beside the bed either side for a lamp table, in fact no space to really get out the bed on the wall side. This caused a few awkward moments with hubby trying to get out of bed in the middle of the night for the bathroom & trying to not wake me as he clambers over. This room would be better suited to maybe two twin beds. The headboard also knocked the wall whenever you moved...solved with a rolled up Macy's bag shoved in the gap ;)We also found this bedroom airless and a call to housekeeping saved the day with a table top fan supplied. It was much quieter on this floor compared to last years lower floor..much less street noise.On the whole though, I think we once again got value for money. Great location with clean & functional rooms...albeit a little outdated with furniture & furnishings in some places.

Let me start by saying that the location is unbeatable - down the end of Lewers Street, and across the road from a number of narrow alleyways, any of which will lead you straight onto Waikiki Beach. PROS:Apart from location which is also close to bus stops, trolley stops and all the major attractions and hotels in Waikiki, the decor in the lobby and rooms is tropical and Hawaiian so you feel like you are in Hawaii. For what you get, it is very good value for money.The mattresses on the beds were turned over twice weekly which I thought demonstrated a degree of caring for the guests which I have not experienced elsewhere.Most of the facilities at this hotel were very good - There is a guest laundry which was very convenient; ice machines on two floors; a swimming pool, jacuzzi; exercise room, non denominational religious service each Sunday; signs on every floor near the lifts with upcoming activities around Waikiki, an ABC store next door, 2 clothing/gift shops in the lobby, Denny's chain restaurant and Happy Hour drinks once a week.The male staff, in particular the two managers, were absolutely delightful to deal with and resolved minor issues quickly, efficiently and graciously and took on a more complex issue until it was satisfactorily resolved. They are an absolute asset to that Hotel. Mac, the guy at the activities desk, was really lovely and very helpful. The Hawaiian cleaning lady was really lovely and efficient.CONSI cannot be as complimentary with the female staff with one in particular at the Front Desk needing either a new job or complete retraining. My dealings with her were not conducive to a relaxing vacation and unfortunately I was not the only guest to find her manner abrasive, rude and unpleasant. The same can be said of the Filipina cleaning lady in the laundry.The hotel is across the road from a number of restaurants and bars, so a certain amount of noise is to be expected. The problem was the drunken revellers in the early hours of the morning and the sound of reversing trucks made some nights more difficult to sleep when staying on the lower floors. This problem however was not experienced if one stayed on the higher floors.Air conditioning - There was difficulty operating the air conditioning leading to some uncomfortable nights sleep. Lack of Business Centre - this hotel is marketed as a resort and guests are charged a resort fee of $6 per day but there are no computers available to guests who either have difficulty accessing their emails via wi-fi in their rooms or do not bring smartphones or such devices with them on vacation. The only computer available is one laptop at the front desk which is purportedly only for the printing of boarding passes but is not signposted as such and with a policy which is arbitrarily implemented.

Renovations are planned, but don't expect high-end refurbishment. It's destined to be a middle-income hotel/condo so the prices should stay reasonable, compared to the Trump Tower and the new Ritz Carlton. That means the other 99% of us can at least afford to stay somewhere nice when we visit Hawaii.The location is ideal: 1/2 block from Waikiki Beach, and 1 block from Kalakaua (the main drag). An ABC store is right downstairs and parking is available. Lewers Street had gotten a bit classier over the years, but you can still find some reasonable stores, if you look hard enough, including stores that sell products that are locally made in Hawaii.The rooftop pool is a nice alternative to the beach, with sun from about 9 am to 3 pm.

We stayed at the Imperial from Dec.18-23, 2013. Everything was fine about the hotel except the location of the room. They put us on the 7th floor and I could hear EVERYTHING that was happening on the streets below. We checked into the hotel late Wednesday and got straight into bed. I could hear people yelling, horns blowing, motorcycles revving their engines. It took me a long time to get to sleep.The next morning first thing my daughter and I did was get up and go to the front desk to see if we could switch rooms. I was told I had to go to 2nd floor reservations and so we did. The woman at the front desk up there was rude. She was not at all considerate or caring. It was all about ""business."" She said she may have a room on the same side of the building and I said that was fine as long as it was much higher. She then told me about the $50.00 cleaning fee. WHAT!!! $50.00 to change sheets on a bed because that's literally all I did in that room. Absolutely ridiculous. I hadn't unpacked a thing. I literally plopped on the bed and slept in my clothes. Or shall I say ""tried"" to sleep! Well, I walked away and was really upset the entire day but had to let it go so I could enjoy myself without the stress. Each night was the same except come Monday morning, Dec. 23rd I was awakened at 5:52am by the trash truck, I'm guessing anyway. And they must have had 20 trash cans to pick-up because the noise seemed to last forever!!! I couldn't get myself back to sleep and it was my last morning to sleep in. For this reason, and the lack of respect and caring, I will never stay at this place again. I am a timeshare owner and have paid thousands of dollars over the years for the timeshare and maintenance fees.

And what I really look for in a hotel is a clean smelling room (No Smoking), and unlike some people on here I have no intentions of crawling around the floor on my hands & knees like some old sweetie wife checking under the settee for any fluff, or inspecting the furniture for scratches, or measuring the soap for thickness. Me personally I found this room on the 22nd floor more than adequate and with a good view of Waikiki and in particular the Pacific Ocean who could complain about this? Yes I do agree the room could do with a makeover but it wasn't that bad to be honest and the Murphy bed was a godsend in itself as one simply flicked it up out of sight and behold, a bigger room.! Now who the hell comes to Honolulu and stays in their room and continually inspects it when there's a whole tropical Island to explore and enjoy? I can never understand people who make it their mission in life to find faults in a hotel, like a fellow guest we kept bumping into who spent his entire holiday complaining to the desk about stupid things like his towels not being ""Soft Enough"" even the room cleaner got an earful one day.Looking around my room it had everything one needed to be self catering if you wanted, microwave, fridge, iron, flat screen TV etc. but we rarely used this room for cooking as we ate out mostly, but for people on a budget well, It's perfect and here downstairs you have the ABC store which sells just about everything you could possibly want, they even have a delicatessen too. Next door is ""Denny's"" a fast food diner, and just around the corner is the famous beach itself. As for the laundry you have the self service washing machines on level 2 on the car park, you don't even have to travel far for anything here, as for the rooftop pool well, it's wet if anything but don't go up here expecting to be doing an Olympic back stroke, or scuba diving lessons, as it's quite small enough to just enjoy the gentle breeze and peace it offers. Also on a Tuesday night there is a fireworks display further down the beach and here is the perfect place to watch it.!Our room in particular was cleaned every Tues, Sat. and if you needed fresh towels, sheets, in fact anything at all inbetween then simply pop down to the maintenance floor and the friendly women will happily change everything for you no sweat. One day our Ironing board broke and on reporting it found it was replaced an hour later good service, As for our bathroom it served it's daily purpose too. The reception staff were always friendly and waving to us, and as for the bell boys outside they were brilliant always up for a laugh with me, one even impersonating my Scottish accent badly which was always in good fun, needless to say he got it reciprocated very quickly. These guys were so efficient in the parking of cars and arranging taxis even getting me a great deal up to the punch bowl etc. Thanks lads. As for the Concierge's Michael & Scott, they were top blokes in arranging trips and giving out really good decent advice, with no Bull**** attached, they'll advise you on anything even the weather for the next day if you want. Michael's quite a character beware.! One day we managed to get up to the owners lounge and here the views over the Ocean were simply amazing, but unless you get an invite it's out of bounds to us mortals, (As we sneaked in, shhhh) , but the location of this hotel is it's major selling point as your central to everything within walking distance including the many bus stops taking you anywhere in Honolulu as well as the many restaurants to behold. Even better the US Army Museum is just around the corner too, and having stayed in many hotels around the World most good some bad, the Imperial stands out as being very good. In fact it was pretty quiet with just the odd door slamming Imbecile who somehow couldn't fathom out how to shut a door quietly some days, it's a common disease which seems to afflict certain people on holiday, however it wasn't as bad as what you get in some hotels in Europe, where hotel door slamming is considered a synchronised door slamming Olympic event, a truly annoying phenomenon which seems to affect the simple minded, the worst being in Egypt some years ago when around 50 Russian guests were leaving at 4 in the morning absolutely horrific.As for the Imperial Hotel, I would definitely stay here again no problem as we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, with no worries at all. Even when I e-mailed some requests before we arrived they were answered promptly, and do check out the large colourful Aquarium behind reception a real eye catcher. Once again the staff were a credit here, very friendly and helpful too.Just be aware folks of the hidden extras in the final price like local taxes etc, as it can be a sore one on checkout as some people found out to their cost. as for me I was well ahead of the pack on this one. And after a ""Tiring"" day shopping, drinking, eating, lazing around the concrete madness of Honolulu, one can always retreat back to the safe haven of the Imperial...

However, a very spur of the moment trip left me with little choice of available rooms.So. I booked thru an online booking service. Not my usual style- I like to book directly. I already knew the location. Our preferred area in Waikiki, quieter than up near the main street. You are across the road from the beach. There is a hotel in your way ;) but its still only a skip across the road to a beach access passage. ABC shop downstairs & plenty places to eat & drink. Anyhow. I arrive to find they don't have my booking. The young lady searched hard for vacating rooms etc. There was a more expensive room available but the manager wouldn't upgrade me...not even when I offered to negotiate a price for it.

Small balcony. Bedroom was off to the left with a double bed ( didn't feel like a queen) tv & drawers , wardrobe & another bathroom. Both bathrooms were the same. Toilet, small sink & bath with shower head. Grab bars in the bath. The view was of the embassy suites opposite & the Wyndham resort to the right. Looking down onto Lewers st. U can see across to the 5 star Halekuani & 4 str outrigger reef. No ocean view fron the7th floor but higher levels do. The room in general was clean , maybe a little tired in places. I'd love to get new carpets in the bedoom. The bathrooms are SMALL. If u have long legs u will need to sit side saddle or your knees Will hit the bath. Hair dryer. We had a few ant friends in the bath. Not in the kitchen strangely enough. Thy didn't bother us. The pool on the roof is small & always seemed to be busy with kids. Laundry on the second floor, soda machines & ice. Beach towels in your room & u can get fresh ones from housekeeping. Housekeeping came twice a week to vacuum & do the sheets.  Couldn't find much to complain about. ( just remember people below you do not wantYour cigarette butt or your spit landing on their balcony while they sit out & have morning coffee!!! - yes that happened twice) For the money it is very good. I noticed hotel prices have risen a lot lately but this is very affordable. In fact, I'm about to rebook for next year & save $70 a night on the rooms in the Outrigger Reef ( we love the o/r but prices have increased a lot).You can't escape noise in Waikiki, but this is a relatively quiet part of town but just 5 minutes from the main road & steps to the beach.

The general opinion is the building location is awesome and convenient, but the condition of the property (especially the rooms) are in dire need of refurbishing.My family stayed in a Hala suite, a 2-br & 2-bath unit. There are 8 bed spaces, but with a odd layout. The master bedroom has a private bathroom 2 queen beds, the 2nd bedroom has a double, and the living room sofa folds out to be a queen as well. We have 3 kids, so it would've been much better to have 2 queen beds in the 2nd bedroom. That way, one of them wouldn't have to sleep out on the sofa bed. Meanwhile, the 2nd queen bed in the master bedroom ended up being used as a storage...odd if you ask me.Anyway, the location of the building is great! It's very close to everything, very convenient. They provide valet parking service (mandatory & daily charge), so you don't have to worry about parking. There is large ABC store on the first floor that sells just about everything. It's walking distance to MANY restaurants and shops!However, the condition and the rooms and public area are not in the best shape. The kitchen area has very little counter top. We had to use the stove stop to as an extension of the small counter space (we don't use stove while on vacation, only microwave). The same goes for both bathrooms. The sink counters are tiny, and there are no shelves, medicine cabinet to place your toiletries.For the price we paid, I think the Imperial was a very good deal. The unit, albeit small, oddly laid out, and not in the best condition, does provide MUCH more space than a typical hotel room; and, it's location is unbeatable.",California,"PA_FanMan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",27,3.0

The location is central. Close to the beach. Owners Suite on top floor.Cons: Old interior in common areas, smelly due to poor air circulation, owners/board members do not maintain their asset by upgrading and maintenance. We stayed in a TINY 2 bedroom Hala unit with a ""micro"" kitchenette. The stove was from 1972 (no joke) and the dishwasher from the early 80's that was soo loud we would leave when it was on. The carpet was soo gross- 15-20 years old per hotel management and just filthy. We actually traveled with another family so there were 3 adults and 2 kids. We were soo embarrassed as the other family would not even walk around with their shoes off! The master bedroom has 2 old tiny full size beds with prison like bedding- there is a nice balcony off this room to get much needed fresh air in the room. The bathroom is old, scruffy and tiny as well. The second bedroom is more of a closet. Again a gross old double bed but the room was smaller than our RV bedroom!! The ""closet"" is used to hold a small old 3 drawer dresser that one can access only from sitting on the bed! No room to walk around either- YIKES! The other bathroom by the front door is ridiculous-the door opens into the tiny room so you have to back in and maneuver to close! The old rattan couch was just that- we actually got a spare sheet and threw it over it the entire week we were there and still never sat on it.

The two bathrooms were quite handy. Our friends were in the same type of room on the 11th floor and only problem was with the plumbing in one of their bathrooms. The room was booked through Hotels.com who stated that room price included taxes. After booking I contacted the Imperial who confirmed our booking and that there were additional taxes. Even though I requested confirmation of the room cost I was not advised by them that there was an additional $6 per day resort fee and also the requirement for an additional $250 deposit to be paid on arrival to cover if you smoked in the room. Too bad if you were on a budget !!!. Luckily I had taken copies of emails and confirmations as at check-in when I disputed the fees and charges I was told this was stated in the booking confirmation. I had the proof it was not but made no difference and had to be paid. Even when I questioned their own email confirming costs I was told by the manager on duty I didn't ask about any additional fees or charges and it was my fault. All in all it was a pleasant stay and convenient to pretty much everything. Less than five minute walk to Waikiki beach. Convenient to pick up points for various tours if they don't pick-up at the door. Staff were friendly,efficient and willing to book taxis and shuttles.

First off before even booking this condo I did my research and read up on comments from other guests who have stayed here but with an opened mind. I work in the hospitality industry and know how people can over exaggerate their experience especially a bad one. So when booking this condo i kept my expectations low. So here it goes.Arriving:Not a very well lit hotel sign we past it once and had to go around the block again because it is a one way road. But once we got there the valet greated us with the ""Aloha Spirit"" Hawaii is known for. Valet is $25 a day but its worth it. Waikiki doesn't have a lot of space for parking structures so its okay. But why let this ruin your vacation. Your on a tropical island enjoy it.Oh and about tipping the valet. I read a comment from another guest on here and obviously this person doesn't work off tips otherwise they wouldn't be upset. Yes, I tipped every valet person. Gave them $ when they took my car to park as well as when they brought me my car. Lynette at valet was awesome and always gave ideas of things to do. Thanks Lynette keep up the great work.Check In:Arrived to the front desk. Area was clean not as big as a hotel but this is a condo not a hotel. Please keep this in mind. I was greated again with ""Aloha Spirit"" by Kainoa who was great and very informative. He checked us in and informed where I needed to go. Thanks Kainoa you are awesome.Arriving in my room ""1807"":Walked in and it smelled clean very important to me. Off to my right was a bedroom with (2) queen beds and (1) bathroom exactly what I made my reservations for. Then I walked into a living room which had a sofa bed which my (2) teenagers slept in for 3 nights and said it was very comfortable. There was also another bathroom which they used so the room had a total of (2) bathrooms which was great since there was a total of (3) females in this room.There was a stove, convection oven, fridge and they had dishes sufficient enough for all of us if we wanted to cook a meal. The room had a balcony which I could see the ocean a little. But I planned to see the island not stay in the room. For me as long as the room is clean and comfortable who cares about the view.There was hot water to shower with so that's great. If you need more towels or shampoo & etc you do need to go to the 3rd floor where housekeeping is located which was not a problem for me because if you have stayed at a condo before you don't get this at all. There were also beach towels for us to use which we didn't expect. We went and bought our shampoo & etc from the ABC store downstairs and they have everything you will need while you are here.Location:This condo is in the center of everything. There are tons of restaurants to eat at and tons of shops. The beach is a 2 minute walk away.Well that's all I can think of to say. Oh I also read a review where they said their engagement ring was stolen by housekeeping. Well there is a safe in the room.Why didn't u use it? I know it was a surprise but you didn't have to give her the code. I left my brand new ipad in the room out in pkain sight for everyone to see. We left at 8am and got back at 8pm and it was still there how I left it.

There is a small kitchen, dinning table, a sofa bed and 2 flat screen TVs. We were at room 1907 which is a corner room with great views!!! We had both the ocean and the city view that we admire everyday during our entire 1-week stay!! The room was clean when we entered and the interior was nothing fancy. As I told you, its not a 5-star hotel with luxurious amenities. But if you are ok staying in a hotel with basic amenities (comfortable bed, good air conditioning unit, a relatively clean bathroom with very good water supply --- not to mention a great factor -- THE VIEW from our room was superb!! ) then this hotel will be just as perfect as it is!! Hotel staffs -- Hmmmm -- not everyone is pleased. (or should I say -- you can not please everybody either) -- But Mr. Todd, is very pleasant -- His smiling face and a good reception makes our stay wonderful. Check out time was at 11:00am and our flight back home was at 12 midnight, Mr. Todd was so kind to hand us keys to the Owner's lounge at the 26th floor so we can still stay in the hotel while waiting for our airport shuttle service at 8:00pm. Mr. Michael from the tour desk was equally nice too. The concierge Mr. Paul was so nice to help us with our luggages. Over-all staffs were so nice and help except for some of course ( I wouldnt mention names anymore--)At the hotel's ground floor is ABC grocery store (open from 6:00am to 1:00am) -- a great store that sells basic necessities (food, wine, beer, cigarettes, souvenirs, chocolates, cosmetics like sunblocks , lip balm , etc.. fruits milk, juice, and there's a corner for your basic medicines for cold, cough, insect bites, headache etc) I love this store as you find them everywhere!!! Also at the ground floor is a restaurant named ""Denny's"" great breakfast food ... yummy pancakes!! price range for breakfast would be from $2 - $8 (usual basic breakfast) I gained 4-pounds for just eating pancakes for a week!! hahahahahahaha....Generally, Iam recommending this hotel for those who want a ""relatively nice, comfortable hotel"" to stay in during your trip. And ohhhh .... I forgot to mention that for SHOPAHOLICS this is the BEST PLACE for you!! Just around the corner from Imperial Hotel you can find top rated designer shops such as : Tiffany & Co., Todds, Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Hermes, Salvatore Ferragamo, Coach, DFS (Duty Free Shop) and a lot lot more!! This is shopping mecca for you!! So there you go, have fun in Hawaii!!Mahalo!","Legazpi, Philippines","Ricoy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Legazpi, Philippines</strong>",227,5.0

We booked this hotel because it was a little cheaper than the others in the same area. If you have a rental car you'll have to pay the 25 dollar a day valet fee not including tips. There's no other parking. There's a compulsory daily service hotel charge that allows you to use the pool and sauna. If you want wifi.. You'll pay for it. When we got to the room we opened the curtains to the brick wall of the next door hotel. Beautiful. We had a full kitchenette which we thought would save us money as we wouldn't eat out so much. The kitchen is actually falling apart. The stove, dishwasher looks ancient but still works fine. All very confined. Our main problem was the fry pans they gave us were useless. The food just burned in them no matter how much oil we put in. Fried eggs or pancakes were impossible. They wouldn't replace them either. They also only serviced the rooms on Monday and Friday. And if you needed more towels you had to go the service room to exchange them yourself. We also had to have the fans on with the air conditioning. There was a thermometer and gauge in the wall but no matter how low we turned the gauge it would stay at about 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The hotel room was nice and quiet. The rest of the room was fine. Two good quality tv's a nice lounge and bedroom was comfortable. Having two bathrooms was also nice. Location is fantastic.. Couldn't get much better. Pretty much right on Waikiki beach. So much to see and do. So close to shops and restaurants. Your in the heart of Waikiki. My advice is if you stay here, defiantly get an ocean view room above level 15. And you don't really need a full kitchen because there's so so so many eating options so close by.

We got to the room and it smelled so badly that I had to open the door and let the bad air and AC out. There was trash on the floor and on the furniture like clothing tags, wrappers, sand.

Once we finally checked into our room, there was a chapstick and tag on the sofa and ground which was also covered in dirt. The room and the place itself was surrounded by tacky wall and closet mirrors which did not help its already porn-like atmosphere.

Bathroom was so small you couldn't hardly turn around in it. There was only about a foot of space between the foot of the bed and the wall, but you had to go through it to get to the closet. The whole place was very dated and needed updating. And not just the room, everything except for the lobby looked old. The pool was a bit small and dated.

We've been saying here all week and it doesn't make sense to me how someone would take something from the room when we haven't even checked out yet. We are here with our family and it was supposed to be a memorable trip and now I'm just heart broken. I know things can be replaced in this life but its so sad that someone would do this to people.

For Timeshare owners there is a REALLY nice Owners waiting/lounging area on the 26th floor with beautiful ocean views, T.V.'s, kitchen, pool table, etc.IHVC is a high rise, 27 floors sitting amongst about 6 other high rises, so views are limited of the ocean unless you are on the 24th floor and above. The other floors you mostly see other high rises from the room windows.Main floor: the lobby, activities desk, movie rentals, Denny's restaurant, an ABC store (like a mini grocery/Target) and a few little trinket shops. 2nd floor: parking, laundromat3rd floor: Hot tub, Sauna, workout facility, Housekeeping (available: small appliances, beach chairs, ice chests, extra towels, etc)27th floor: the pool, patio, ice machine, penthouse roomOur room: we exchanged some of our timeshare, we were supposed to receive a 1 bedroom w/partial kitchen but were upgraded to a 1 bedroom with a full kitchen (small fridge, full stove/oven, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, counter, sink, dining ware amenities, SS frying pans, dish towels, etc. if you need anything else just call housekeeping there is a good chance they have it. There is a living room with a couch, T.V. & DVD, a very small balcony w/partial ocean view, a small dining table and chairs, a Murphy Bed (Qn), full bathroom w/tub/shower. The bedroom was small, Queen bed (not the most comfortable), small dresser, closet but you couldn't completely access because the dresser is in front of it and there is no place else to put it. A full bathroom w/ shower only, T.V., DVD, small outside balcony. The room has A/C, a safe, iron, ironing board, beach towels. The decor was dated and even though the room looked newly painted there were stains on the ceiling, the carpet looked like it could be cleaned and it had an overall aged worn look and feeling as well as the hotel in general. Even though IHVC is fairly close to the main drag noise was not much of an issue. Every now and then you could hear sirens or Harleys. I rarely ever heard other guests, never to the side or above us, only occasionally in the hallway. We were directly in front of the elevators (3), I was a little nervous when we first saw this but it was never a noise issue either.IHVC sits on Lewers st 1 block West of Kalakaua ave at the north end of Kalakaua. Kalakaua is the main avenue of Waikiki where most of the shopping, International Marketplace, restaurants, Resort entrances, etc are. Kalakaua avenue is approximately 1.8 miles long ending towards the South at the Honolulu Zoo and Kapiolani Park. For the average person this is a great walking area and you can also pick up the local Trolley's for a nominal fee if you get tired or do too much shopping. Kalakaua is a one way street running North to South for vehicles. There are quite a few one way streets in this area, I would highly recommend getting a good map of the area and becoming familiar with the streets if you are renting a car. Also the IHVC parking fee is $20 per day.Lewers is approximately .2 miles long from IHVC to Kalakaua ave (west to east). The following is on Lewers: several boutique shops, restaurants; The Yard House, Roy's, Giovanni Pastami (they deliver to IHVC & you offer a 10% discount if you pick up the cards at front desk of IHVC) Subway, Sushi restaurant, Cheeseburger's, P.F.Chang's, Ruth Chris Steakhouse and Nobu is around the corner. There is a Starbuck's on Lewers and a Starbucks and Tea House 1 block over on Beachwalk ave.Beach: directly behind IHVC are 2 resorts which sit directly on the beach, The Outrigger and Sheraton. You can access the beach by walking on either side of the resorts or we also found you could walk through most resorts to access the beach they just frown on using their pool.Because we exchanged timeshare time it is hard to compare IHVC based on pricing. As I said it is in a convenient location the staff is very friendly and it had all the amenities we needed away from home just in need of a facelift.Notes: The following is additional info on some of the things we did, so you can continue reading if you like.Airport shuttle-We used Oahu Airport Express. On time. It was a flat $30. No other passengers just our party and luggage. You can only book 3 days in advance but usually not a problem. I requested in advance to stop by the grocery store and he was able to accommodate our request for an additional $15 (based on addt'l time). Once with him you can book your return and any other shuttle service you want on your stay. It took approx 40min airport to IHVC @ noon on a Wed (excluding 30 min store stop). 20min from IHVC to airport @ noon on a Wed.Restaurants: (please remember Hawaii is more expensive so meals tended to be about 30-50% higher then what we normally experience in AZ)YARD HOUSE-reasonable pricing, good selection, very close, nice atmosphere, dining & bar, Happy hour 2-5:30pm M-F, casualFURUSATO'S-decent pricing, great sushi, fast food atmosphere but not fast food, on Kalakaua about 1 mile south (see review on T.A.), dining, casualNOBU-Expensive but good, sushi, beef, Kobe, restricted menu, very close, behind IHVC, hip atmosphere, pretentious, dining & bar, dressyGIOVANNI PASTRAMI-Reasonable pricing, good selection, breakfast also, dining, sports bar area, happy hour & 10% discount for IHVC guests,casualP.F.CHANG'S-Chinese, ok food, reasonable pricing, good selection, casual to dressyCHEESECAKE FACTORY-Reasonable pricing, Great selection, big portions, Love the CF, breakfast also, GREAT CHEESECAKES, about .8 miles South on Kalakaua, dining & bar, casual to dressyPOOL SIDE RESTAURANT AT THE MOANA SURF-RIDER/SPA WESTIN HOTEL-Pricey, decent food, paying for the atmosphere, beachside and good entertainment, dining & bar, beachwear, casualKONA BREWING CO-reasonable, great food, best pork sandwich ever, good selection, dining & bar, casual, off Kalaniana'ole Hwy (10 miles SE)MOANA SURFRIDER HOTEL LANAI RESTAURANT-Buffet breakfast $32pp, cereals, breads & pastries, fruits, eggs, sausage, bacon, Miso soup & fixings, rice, potatoes, cooked to order: waffles, pancakes, omelets, french toast, juices, coffee, tea. Great selection, good food, beautiful ocean view.Rented a Scoot Car (2 seater) 2 cycle engine for 24 hours -$150 (price can vary to $250 based on availability), cannot use on Freeway, big hills are a little challenge but better than a scooter you might want to opt for the 4 cycle but it was out when we decided to rent, a little squirrely but tons of fun. Rental is located on Kuhio just South of the backside of the International Marketplace I believe just after Ka'iulani St. We drove the scoot car SE as far as possible for our time frame and then headed NE past Diamond Head, Hanauma Bay ending up at the beach across from Sea Life Park, nice drive, beautiful scenery. We ran across the Farmers Market at the Kapiolani Community College, GREAT place to stop, free to get in. Wonderful foods from all over, fresh veggies & fruits, bakery goods, beautiful fresh flowers, highly recommend, runs on Sat not sure of any other day. We had lunch at Kona Brewing Company on the way back and had a great meal. Slab on some heavy duty sunscreen, bring a hat, cover up, etc. you don't realize how much sun you are getting with the breeze keeping you cool.There is also a pineapple store just a few doors up from the scooter guy, GREAT fresh pineapple, pineapple juice and smoothies, absolutely worth stopping in for, average cost is $5 for each of the above.Moana Lani Spa @ the Moana Surf-Rider Hotel-Great spa, great therapists, on Kalakaua, just south of Cheesecake Factory (See review T.A.)Pearl Harbor & historic Honolulu Tour-We purchased through the activities desk at IHVC because tickets were already sold out online. If you want to visit on your own time, I would recommend purchasing tickets a few weeks in advance, otherwise Discover Hawaii Tours was absolutely wonderful and you can relax while they fight the traffic. Our tour guide ???(Misty Heaven in english) was so funny, informative and just an absolute kick. I would highly recommend. Cost about $40 pp including transportation & entrance fees.Shopping-It is a shoppers paradise here. If you are looking for great deals though I would recommend going to the swap meet on the weekend. Otherwise pick up the little books you see around town, i.e. Collections, Best of Oahu, etc, there are discount coupons that could have saved us at least $100 had we picked them up early on. Aloha Landing-This is located just to the side of IHVC in the Sheraton semi-underground area (less than 5 min walk). It is where all the tour buses and shuttles pick up for tours. This is also where you can catch a FREE shuttle through Hilo Hattie's (local Hawaiian store). This shuttle takes you all around the Waikiki area and over to the Ala Moana Shopping Mall. A very nice outdoor mall with a few unique stores but most stores are typical mall stores of the Mainland. Still a nice afternoon or evening place to walk around. I believe the shuttle runs every 30 mins and it's FREE!Transportation-We did not rent a car. We periodically used a taxi service, Hubby tore his calf muscle right before coming so on crutches. From IHVC to the South end of Kalakaua Ave a taxi cost us approx. $10 including tip. Going North the cost was around $12-$15 because of the one way streets. You can also buy a weekly pass through the trolley service for about $50 with unlimited usage for 7 days. If we had known sooner we might have rented the little ride along mobility scooters from Honolulu Hawaii Wheelchair & Scooter Rentals 808-772-9723. For anyone with a disability this would come in handy for this area. About $250-$300 for a week.I think that about covers it, hope it helps your vacation to be an easier one!","Fountain Hills, Arizona","desertscubadiver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fountain Hills, Arizona</strong>",127,3.0

If you want to go out for late dinners or go to a nightclub this is definitely your hotel because it is located across the street from ""The Yardhouse Pub"" which is very popular with the party set. We are beyond the age of ""clubbing"" and travel with our young daughter so the noise was audible every night (moderate). We were on the 7th floor facing the pub so the location of our room was likely a factor. I got up at 4 am (due to time change) and went to the 24 hr Denny's on the main floor of the hotel to grab a coffee. The restaurant was busy with inebriated patrons that had come over from the pub after closing. In the following days I noticed that when we went for breakfast at 6am the entire restaurant was filled with family type patrons so we were never concerned about having our daughter be in a ""morning after the night before"" type of environment.The rooftop pool was small but very warm (unlike the Hawaii Hilton Village where we spent the day to use the pools-you can rent a day room there when available, but the pools were unheated so it was a waste of time/money because my daughter and I barely got wet...just too cold). The Imperial pool had some fantastic views and was surrounded by chaise lounge chairs. There is also a third floor sauna and whirlpool which we often got to use alone because it seemed to be rarely used.There were numerous restaurants which we enjoyed within close walking distance from the hotel and the high end stores too numerous to count. You don't need a car, but our best day was when we rented a car and went to the North shore for some peace and quiet. We much prefer the non crowded beaches filled with locals surfing. We also saw turtles at Turtle Beach (1.5 hr drive from the hotel) and ate at a fantastic beach grill that served my favourite coconut shrimp.So in summary, perfect hotel for city type travellers that don't mind some noise (deliveries to stores/restaurants happens in the middle of the night also...so all night long you hear ""beep, beep, beep"" when the trucks are backing up....can be annoying for people like us that prefer silent tranquility on a trip). We were perfectly located for the conference I was attending but if you like quiet, the North shore would be preferable.","Calgary, Canada","Shandent</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",70,3.0

It's one block away from the beach and about 2 short blocks away from the shopping strip. I usually don't spend much time in the room anyways because theres so much to do and walk around to see. This resort is a bit outdated inside but they do have plans to renovate the last time i've been there so hopefully it'll be a little bit different when i go this year.

My only con for this unit was poor water pressure and hot water temperature. For some reason the hot water was inconsistent and at the end of a day I like a hot bath which was not so hot. The large murphy bed was comfortable. We have stayed at the Imperial a few times in different units each time and we like the location as it is close by to everything.

We got into Honolulu 2 days earlier and stayed in a hotel, so we drove by to take a look at the location. We called ahead about the parking so they told us to drive up in front of the ABC store and we would be met there by valet parking and we could just go in and register. That went by so smoothly with a happy welcome and helpful guys. Registration went the same way, no sales talk or invitation to any. What a surprise! Before our room assignment, we asked where were we going to be, hopeful it wasn't where we would have to look at the trash cans. It took a few minutes, and was placed on the 23rd floor. We had a 1 bedroom unit, comfortable for 3 adults. Bedroom and bathroom are small but functional with lots of bathroom towels. Murphy bed in the living room was comfortable and already made up. We had 2 balconies (1 off the bedroom and the other off the living room) with resin chairs and little tables. We ate breakfast out there and enjoyed views of the Sheraton Waikiki, Royal Hawaiian, the beach and the surfers. We also enjoyed night time views of the lights, and the trade winds was wonderful. We even slept with our doors open. The kitchen is small but adequately equipped with a small fridge, toaster and microwave/convection oven. Everything worked. Concierge also helped us with some tours and shows. Everybody was helpful.. We didn't use the laundry, swimming pool, spa or any of the other facilities.

There were two outdoor hot tubs on floor 3.The owners lounge on the 25 floor was really something special with tv's , leather couches , cooking facility and a great view of the ocean. Many would go up there to watch the sunset every night and to see if the green flash would happen when the sun went down. Right next door there was an ABC store with a great deli and a few dow from it was an Italian restaurant called Giovanni's which had excellant pizza. They had a happy hour from 3-5 with free cheeze pizza but did not make it for happy hour.

The owners lounge was so dead, we could go up to the huge balcony and watch the waves all by ourselves. A few times we grabbed a bottle of wine and snacks and cards and went up there. The lounge has glasses and utensils etc so you don't have to bring that from your room. Having a kitchen was great for breakfast and drinks. A whole week in Waikiki was enough though.

I was a little concerned by some of the negative reviews so I called the hotel a number of times to ensure that we were not stuck in a room on a low floor. Well, when we arrived (3 adults/2 kids), we were told that we had been assigned a room on the 5th Floor. At that point, I basically begged the front desk for a room on a higher floor. i was then sent to the timeshare rental/reservation office on the 2nd Floor, where I pretty much begged again...It seemed to work because we ended up with a room on the 23rd Floor. From the balcony, we had a sliver of a view of the ocean. As many have said, the rooms are tiny and dated - a flash back to the 70s! The ceilings were super low, and it was a very tight fit for the five of us in a 1 bedroom/2 bath. My Mom and daughter slept on the double bed in the bedroom; my husband and I were on the murphy bed in the living room and my 7 year old slept on the sofa bed. The bed in the bedroom takes up most of the room and the bathroom in that room is tiny. You can't open the bathroom door if someone is standing at the closet. I felt like we were constantly bumping into each other! There was small microwave and refrigerator in the room and the electric burners worked. However, the oven in our room did not work. We had to purchase all the cleaning supplies ourselves. There is tiny pool on the 27th floor, and there is a nice party room/kitchen for owners on the 26th floor with lovely views. We only went up there once but heard that it is first come/first serve to use the kitchen up there. We did our laundry a few times and laundry area (off the parking garage) was pretty busy. The staff at the front desk and the valets who parked our car were very friendly and helpful. The facility needs a huge upgrade but that's not their fault. Time share management should really refuse to all this hotel to be a part of the network of time share hotels! On the positive side, as many have said, it is very conveniently located. We rented a car at the airport (parking on a weekly basis is slightly less), and were able to quickly get around town. It was convenient to have in/out privileges. On the days we did not want to drive, we could quickly get to several restaurants around the Imperial. ABC is more expensive than a regular grocery store but the location under the Imperial had great supplies - I was able to make a great eggs & bacon & toast breakfast the first morning with awesome kona coffee - all purchased at ABC! We loved being next door to the Halekulani. While dinner at the hotel's formal restaurant is expensive, we discovered the House Without a Key - the more casual, outdoor/indoor eating area at the Halekulani. We had delicious food at very reasonable prices there with fantastic service and live music/hula overlooking the ocean. The only snag is that they don't take reservations but if you go early it is not difficult to get a table. There are some chairs and cocktails tables right in the front, some larger tables under umbrellas a bit further back, or you can sit under a open air house. We preferred the middle option both nights we had dinner there. Thursday nights, they put on a bbq, which was really nice. Whether you are a guest at the exclusive Halekulani or just there for dinner/drinks, the food and service are fabulous! Although we did not go ourselves, we heard that the brunch and daily high tea are lovely. The tea at around $35 per person seemed quite reasonable to us. Again, no reservations and first come/first serve for the high tea. We had Christmas dinner at PF Chang's right down Lewers. Although, I am not a fan of chains, the food and service were really great there. I do recommend reservations because it was very crowded. We spent three days at the beach in Kilua. It was an amazing beach and rarely crowded. At my daughter's request, we went to Wailea Shaved Ice every day! We had a wonderful dinner at Little Village Noodle House in Chinatown one night. They serve delicious authentic Chinese food - I especially liked the hunan/schzewan food and the friendly service. Everything was very fresh and delicious. I also loved the fact that it has a 25/30 Zagat rating and free parking! We also had a great Thai meal at Siam Square although service was a bit disorganized. On our last day in town we had brunch at Lulu's Waikiki. The food was average but the service and views of Waikiki Beach were great.","Foster City, California","foodieFosterCity</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Foster City, California</strong>",80,3.0

Ocean & shopping are right there. The beds were comfortable the owners lounge was very nice especially when our flight wasn't til midnite. only problem we had is when the elevator got stuck and it took a little time to get us out.

We have stayed here a few years before in the Banyan suite with a Murphy bed. This time we stayed in the slightly larger Palm suite. Palm suites are corner units with a wall of windows. But we had to leave the curtains closed most of the times due to strong sun. Plus, the view was meh, just the other hotels with a sliver of ""ocean view"". Although in my previous review I vowed not to stay here again, the location and price drew me back.It's convenient to everywhere, whether one travels by bus, shuttle, taxi, or walking. The hotel is in a central location just down the street from the ultra exclusive, read ""expensive"", Trump International. On a side note, we stayed at that location fifteen years ago when it was an Outrigger hotel. It was later torn down to build the Trump hotel. So, I guess I can tell people that we've stayed at the Trump :-P We paid $600 for a whole week during the height of summer vacation season. So, for us, it was definitely worth it to stay here. If we paid anywhere close to the quoted price of $225 per night, this would have been a whole different review. All in all, the Imperial of Waikiki offers a great value for the location. It is surrounded by some famous hotels of Waikiki, such as Hale Kulani, Hilton Hawaiian Village, the aforementioned Trump, and many others that are ultra expensive. Although their accommodations I'm sure are much nicer, I feel the Imperial of Waikiki is a great value. Sure, it has the sagging sofa bed and dated kitchen appliances that belong in a museum, but the bed was very comfortable and the room was clean.

This was our first trip to Hawaii and we had moderate expectations for the hotel based on the reviews we've read. That said, we were able to get a pretty good deal using RCI points, and don't usually spend a lot of time in our room so it worked out ok for us. The PRO's:Location, location, location.... The hotel is in a PRIME location. It's 1 block off the beach, and right at the end of the beachwalk, which has plenty of fine restaurants and shopping at your door step. Waikiki beach is just a 2min across the street. It is also near Fort DeRussy military park and museum.There is a great owners lounge on the 27th floor where you can get a great view of the beach, and have access to showers, kitchen and computers - all which come in handy after you've checked out but before you fly out. The price was right and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Our first room was located on the 5th floor with an awesome view of the ABC roof top, and some plumbing. We were able to move up to a room on the 15th, facing east (where we could see some water) with no problems.The CON's:The room we stayed in needs updating. The mini kitchen has what appears to be a circa '70's oven, which fits right in with the general look & feel of the place. The bathrooms and bedroom are tiny, in fact the whole room we stayed in (1bdr) was pretty small. Not that big of a deal as long as you don't want to spend a lot of time there. If there were 4 people in there (using the wall bed as well) I think it would be pretty tight.The pool is located on the roof and isn't very appealing. It's a small area, but we really only went up there to see... since, well.. the beach is across the street.Parking isn't cheap. I don't think this is really just at the hotel, but in the waikii area in general. We rented a car for a day and ended up returning it early instead of parking. There were some other factors in this, it's $20 to park overnight. You can park in other locations not to far for $6 - $10 / 10 hrs (overnight allowed).Overall, it was a solidly average hotel.

We are both spoiled foodies, like the finer experience, so we tried Wolfgang's happy hour (reasonable for a few hours very upscale afterward) and Taormisu's which was so good we went twice for dinner! Shopping within one block includes every designer name you've ever seen, but I found a place called Turquoise just around the corner with women's party clothes at ridiculously low prices. The International Bizarre is also waling distance and features beautiful fashions made in Hawaii at reasonable prices. The fabric feels like a tropical breeze on your skin. If you're in town on a Saturday morning be sure and book your table for brunch at The Jade Dynasty Seafood Restaurant at Ala Moana Center. The Center is upscale shopping on the top 3 floors, locals shop in the basement shops, but the legends of live radio, Perry & Price Saturday Morning Show, KSSK AM, is broadcast live on the 4th floor at The Jade Dynasty. It features dim-sum and live entertainment & is really fun.I also shopped at a few of the stores in the hotel lobby and I feel the prices were reasonable and the customer service outstanding.Honolulu is very expensive but the people are nice and the weather outstanding, even in the ""winter"" months where it's ""cold"" (the locals all wore jackets but for me it was heaven, 70's-80's F. with a little light rain) it was a great stay at a very nice place.","Chicago, Illinois","Uchi-mama</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",64,4.0

We had the Hala suite, which can sleep up to six, but only for two people. It was large enough for us, but with more than 4 people I feel like it would be very cramped when everyone is in the suite.

But because housekeeping only comes after the 4th day and we stayed 2 nights I did not want to risk losing the 250-dollar deposit.

The room was updated with a convection oven, nice counter top, big sinks and great shower. However, we did not care about those things. I was there with 2 friends and my 2 daughters who are in their early 20's. The location worked well because I did not want to rent a car, and at night and it works well because my girls wanted to hit the night life and we enjoy great dinners. We did bus tours (which I typically shun) most days and had a blast; every part of the Island is accessible. The shopping was fun but I would recommend that if you want to leave your money with the real Hawaiians head to the Farmer's Market or local stands on your tours. There is a farmer's market outside of Diamond Head on Saturday mornings I would recommend. Talk to the locals and they will always give you great advise on where to purchase the treasures you are looking for. At the farmers market we purchased nut butter and bread there for the week and tried a lot of local favorites tastes.

Average water views, and we were on the 23rd floor.The most painful part of my experience were the lifts. Being a high rise building (27 or so floors) the three lifts service ALL floors (instead of being split up). What this means is you will wait forever for a lift, which I experienced often especially when getting ice from the machines only located on level 2 or 27 (inconvenient).Overall it was one of the cheaper places which is why we stayed, but Waikiki will always be expensive.

It's also woefully outdated; bathrooms look and feel like late 60's Holiday Inns'. They remind me of childhood vacations with the parents in South Dakota. Unfortunately, that's not what I look for in a multi-hundred $$/day ""resort"". Rooftop pool is tiny at best. I wondered about the property when I went to their website before we came, it too looks like it's from the 70's (yes, I know the internet didn't exist in 70's). Turns out the website is on par with the rest of the property. On site restaurant is a Denny's, which seems highly appropriate. Concierge Michael quickly volunteered he could not give any advice on activities not booked through him, guess he didn't want to lose the commission. Such a helpful young man. I doubt other area accommodations charge $50/week for internet access, nor $6/day mandatory fee for the ""free"" local phone calls. Will say the valet parkers are efficient. Good thing as you're required to use them for a bargain $125/wk (plus tips of course). The ""kitchen"" (kitchen is a stove top that looks like it belongs in a 60's era Winnebago, microwave, and minifridge that almost freezes ice cubes) sink in our unit started loudly belching water out, eventually discovered an issue in unit above us. Of course, we had to call twice, guess the first maintenance person I asked forgot or something. When we got back after maintenance was in our unit, we were greeted by a sign in hall warning of wet floor, and true to advertising, our floor had a pool of water. Wondered why they left it for me to clean up rather than mop it themselves, perhaps that was another extra charge. If you come here, be fully advised this is nowhere near comparable to nearby properties, and has a host of ""gotcha"" extra fees. Yes, management was apologetic, and comped internet service and parking for our continued issues, but that didn't improve the nonfunctioning shower in one bathroom, the constant nighttime noise of slamming doors, or the complete lack of any amenities (other than limited selection of DVD's available for the low, low price of $3/night).

The exterior looks okay, but the interior and especially the rooms leave a LOT to be desired. Rooms are in serious need of an update. We will never, ever stay at the Imperial again. There are many other condo-style accommodations in Waikiki. It will be well worth it to pay a bit extra per night than this place. We didn't take advantage of the kitchenette as we only used the room to sleep and get ready since it was so disgusting and uninspiring. This place was a big wrinkle in an otherwise awesome vacation. PROS:- The front desk and valet staff were very nice, attentive, professional, and knowledgeable. - ABC Store downstairs.- 27th floor pool deck was decent. - Location: It's close to A beach. (Not the best section of Waikiki Beach though.)CONS:- When we walked in, we thought it was Golden Girls, but had not been updated since 1987! The green carpeting was old, gross, and faded near the windows. Oh yeah, it was coming up from the walls where the staff has pulled up the carpet to stuff electric cords down there. Isn't that illegal or against some code? The wicker furniture was equally gross, uncomfortable, and in need of an update. - The bathroom was TINY! It made me think I was in an RV. You could use the toilet and wash your hands at the same time. Oh yeah, the ""dusty rose"" color of the toilet was equally 1987, but hey, it worked. The wallpaper was so outdated. How much would it cost to replace that?!- The bedroom had a hard double bed. You will probably have to walk sideways to get around it and in to the main area of the bedroom. There is about a foot of clearance between the bed and the wall. It just doesn't seem right.- Being on the 10th floor affords no views. Our unit was also on the Lewers side, so we got street noise (with sliding doors closed) from trash trucks and their back up beeps early in the morning. Noise from drunk patrons at Yard House at the mall (Beach Walk) across the street was also annoying. - Location. You will be in the middle of the outdoor mall on Lewers Street, full of mainland chains and nothing of interest. I can go to Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs, and Yard House back home... The beach closest to Imperial is in front of the Outrigger Reef. It's not the best part of Waikiki - kind of the outskirts in my opinion. - Hot tubs. We visited the hot tubs and felt like it was a temporary location. There are two backyard style hot tubs on some random patio with ugly/ghetto green awnings. Oh yeah, the hotel workers take their breaks and smoke just below the 3rd floor hot tub area, so you get some great secondhand smoke with your tradewinds.

It was a challenge staying a whole week with spouse, two young kids and the IN-LAWS (!). To top it off, there was a lot of construction going on in and around the building. We actually had workers ON/ IN our lanai doing some kind of work the whole time we were there. Since it was Spring Break and the hotel was completely sold out, the management couldn't switch rooms for us. Needless to say, that was a bummer.

Prior to my friend’s arrival I stayed in a studio for 3 days (horrible). See my other review for the studio. This is the 5th time I have stayed at The Imperial.Room: “Banyan” Unit 905: Light, bright, clean. Peek-a-views of ocean from the deck, but really just views of other hotels (I know from experience, higher floors can have great views). Small true one bedroom with queen bed, and a pull out sofa and Murphy bed in the living room. It could sleep six(!), but it is more ideal for two single friends, or a couple with kids. Linens and beds were clean and comfortable. Kitchenette was modestly stocked with utensils. Convection microwave, toaster, fridge and coffee maker are good for snacks, but I really wish it had a cook-top. In a pinch, you can go to the owners lounge and use their stovetop if you can find pots/pans.Service/Staff: Accommodating. Polite, but not particularly outgoing, warm or friendly. Occasionally a single person at the front desk could not efficiently handle the line of guests.Amenities: Good weight room, sauna and nice rooftop pool. An owner’s lounge on the top floor is a nice place to relax and take in panoramic views. Overnight parking is reasonable for Waikiki at $25/nt. No free Wi-Fi, Lan connection for pay.Location: Premium. The Imperial is an excellent location in the middle of Waikiki. 1 block to the beach, steps to all shopping, restaurants and amenities.All in all, the micro-location and floor level can make or break a vacation, but otherwise a fair value for a clean and quiet home in the middle of Waikiki.As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure. The city comes with the negatives of a big city, along with the overwhelming benefits of a beautiful beachfront resort. Generally, everything in Waikiki is “a little tired” although there have been continuous improvements in the last few years. If you are traveling solo, take Roberts Hawaii from the airport for $12 (no rsvr rqd). Two or more people, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (should be under $40). In Waikiki, nearly everything is walking distance or a short shuttle/bus away.

We had room 2007 which was a corner unit with south- and west-facing windows. Great to watch the boats and surfers, then to see the sunset. This is a huge improvement to the room we got in 2010 were we were stuck in a low level room facing east (Waikiki Parc hotel). It was spacious for a family of 4.The only issues were the out-dated airconditioning and old windows which did not shelter us from heat and street noise as well as they should. Every morning, we were woken up at 6am with sound of garbage trucks on Lewers Street. The lanai was very small and not pleasant due to all the traffic noise. I have been told that some units have been renovated, but this is not one of them. Kitchen appliances and bathrooms are still old.However, you can't beat the location.

One of us could run and bring down a couple more rounds. We did microwave some oatmeal for breakfast at first but the went to a market and ate fresh fruit the rest of our stay. (not much cooking) The pool is small but who swims there when at the beach?! We ordered salads to go one night and ate on the balcony of the owners lounge. It was the cheapest meal with the best view our entire trip. Look at other places with these amenities on Waikiki and you will easily double or triple what we spent. We bought our week outright from an owner listing on VRBO and he charged us $100 per night. Suddenly pastel colors and ratan furniture didn't look so bad to us!

It has a queen bed in the bedroom ( looks more like a full bed) a full murphy bed, and queen pull out sofa (horribly uncomfortable). We had 3 adults and my 4yr old daughter. It was a tight fit. They say it is good for 3 but really 2 is best. Not necessarily a family place... I did not get a welcoming family feeling especially when I took my daught to the roof top pool.

This was our 7th trip to Hawaii and 4th trip to Oahu. One of us stayed on Lewers Street 30 years ago (in a place since torn down) so it was quite interesting to see the changes.The location (across from the Halekulani on the beach side and Roy's/Trump/Embassy Suites across Lewers) is hard to beat. Just steps from the beach and in the middle of all the *happy hour* activity in the area. Plenty of places to eat, drink, walk, relax, etc.Also, our favorite haunt while there was the ABC Store down below. You can get everything there --- food to fix in the unit, juices/alcohol/souvenirs/clothing ---- everything. That ABC store became like home to us during our stay. There are also some clothing/jewelry/souvenir stores adjoining the lobby, as well as a Denny's which we wouldn't normally eat at but the rain was so heavy while we were there that we actually DID eat at the Denny's one night and the food was pretty good.I can't say enough about the bell staff. The regular desk staff was good but the bell guys who you work with to move your car back-and-forth OR to call a cab ---- OUTSTANDING. Friendly, polite, efficient, helpful. They don't get any better. I loved those guys.We rented a car for two days (parts of 3 days --- 48-hours) and because we got the unit on an RCI exchange (thus I guess we qualified for a timeshare parking rate), we paid $20 for two days of parking. Obviously, we gave the guys well-deserved tips. It was cheaper than I expected and so easy to leave the keys with the guys.The hotel has a pool up on top and a couple of hottubs on the 3rd floor, along with a sauna and fitness room there. We didn't use any of those as the weather was so awful --- constant rain. But, they are there and we did check them out. We paid for the DSL internet. The Imperial didn't have wireless available. Internet was $15 a week which we were happy to have since we needed to change all our plans, due to the weather. Very handy to have access for a lot of quick Googling.As far as the unit, we got what we reserved (an RCI trade) and it had many amentities (Palm unit --- 2 baths, 2 flatscreen TV's, DVD players, full kitchen, 2 extra beds as fold-outs, etc.) but, frankly, it was a dump. Except for the new Mr. Coffee coffeepot and the flatscreen TV's, everything else in the kitchen was very old and dated. The stove and dishwasher and microwave looked so old, I didn't use them. Fixtures are dated. Cabinets are very dated and cheapo particle board. Furniture and tile and bath counters were very old and looked dirty or very tired. There was a huge chip (chunk out of) in a bath counter.It's possible that the unit we had was one which had never been upgraded as we did see pictures of other units in the building which were more modern and less tacky. Also, there are a lot of mirrors in the unit which make it look bigger than it was, in the advertising.Our unit (2004, on the 20th floor) is about 520 square feet (we measured it) and did have two tiny balconies, but the unit backed out to the Waikiki Parc and the Sheraton (with a small ocean view between the Sheraton and the Halekulani) and seemed to be in an elevator shaft-type space. In other words, down below were the generators (and garbage-collection centers) of all the high-rise hotels and we could not open the balcony doors without being overtaken with a huge roar of noise.All in all --- we appreciated the location and the staff (and the comfortable bed in the tiny bedroom) but our unit was a *blast from the past* (old and tired) and not relaxing. We're not so picky on the view but it would have been nice to have a little more quiet out on the balcony, so that we could open the patio doors without being blasted with high-volume urban generator noise.

When my friend arrived I moved to a 1-bedroom for a week. See my other review for the 1-bedroom.Service/Staff: Accommodating. Polite, but not particularly outgoing, warm or friendly. Occasionally a single person at the front desk could not efficiently handle the line of guests.Amenities: Good weight room, sauna and nice rooftop pool. An owner’s lounge on the top floor is a nice place to relax and take in panoramic views. Overnight parking is reasonable for Waikiki at $25/nt. No free Wi-Fi, Lan connection for pay.Location: Premium. The Imperial is an excellent location in the middle of Waikiki. 1 block to the beach, steps to all shopping, restaurants and amenities.Studio room, Unit 301 : Clean but Horrible. Dark, dank, depressing and noisy. Located 1-foot from housekeeping’s door, 3 feet from the staffs changing room, and next to the sauna, spa, and gym, doors were always banging/sqeeking, opening and closing 24 hours a day. The patio of 301 was covered with a tarp. No light, no view. Situated on a alley, workers on smoking breaks could be heard at all hours. This room should not be available to guests. It should be storage. In fact, all rooms on the 3rd floor should be avoided. At over $100/nt, there is no value in these rooms. If I had to stay more than 3 days in this room, it would ruin a vacation.Please see my other review of Unit 905.As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure. The city comes with the negatives of a big city, along with the overwhelming benefits of a beautiful beachfront resort. Generally, everything in Waikiki is “a little tired” although there have been continuous improvements in the last few years. If you are traveling solo, take Roberts Hawaii from the airport for $10 (no rsvr rqd). Two or more people, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (should be under $30). In Waikiki, nearly everything is walking distance or a short shuttle/bus away. If you need a car for the day, you can rent one in Waikiki.","Seattle, Washington","mjgriffy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",101,2.0

Her room on the 10th floor overlooking Lewers Street was very noisy and showed signs of age and neglect.There was rust on most of the bathroom fittings and the sheets and towels were worn, faded and stained. However, the room itself appeared to be cleaned well, though the carpets were overdue a steam clean. A friend stayed on the opposite side of the hotel though overlooking the Sheraton and this side of the hotel was much quieter and from the balcony (and pool deck) offered great sea views (Floor 21).Security was lacking somewhat as the keycard access on the elevators had been disabled meaning anyone could access floors.

It is very close to the beach, close to trolley stops (including the pink line shopping trolley to take you to the Ala Moana shopping centre)- spacious studio (Ohia suite) - sleeps 4 (although this would be cramped - better for 2 people), standard fit out but very good kitchen facilities, large balcony- in room safe/iron/ironing board- comfortable Murphy bed- courteous and helpful staff (see below)- great deals available - $95 per night (pre-taxes) (via booking.com)Cons- i do not recommend the rooms on level 3 adjacent to the Housekeeping area - due to the volume of foot traffic (staff with their trolleys and coming in and out of their changeroom, and guests - to pick up extra towels etc), it was very noisy. To the Imperial's credit, when i pointed this out, they changed my room the next day As previous guests have stated, the rooms higher up definitely have the better viewsI did not use the pool/sauna so cannot comment (and as the beach was so close by, i didn't feel the need)All up this is a place I would definitely stay at again.

I can't imagine a better location to enjoy all that Oahu has to offer than the Imperial. It is located right next to the Beachwalk, and within easy walking distance of numerous restaurants and world class shopping. Views from the lower floors are limited, but the owner's lounge and surrounding balconies on the 26th floors provide some of the greatest views on the island, including awesome sunsets and a front-row seat for the Friday night fireworks from the Hilton. The lounge is equipped with ample soft furniture, a full kitchen, huge flat screen TV, pool table, and guest computer stations.I purchased a studio timeshare unit this year, and because of the timing, was able to stay for two weeks. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous, check-in and check-out were a breeze. The room was very clean, with full maid service three times during my stay, with daily trash pickup and towel exchange. The rooftop pool on the 27th floor and the hot tubs on the third floor balcony were also nice. There is also a guest laundry and workout room. An ABC store on the first floor provided easy access to purchase snacks, gifts, beer, wine, spirits, etc.Some of the more upscale restaurants within a block or two include Roy's, the Ocean House, Ruth Chris, and several upscale Asian, Italian, and Steak houses. The city bus is cheap and very reliable, and several shuttle services and hop-on/hop-off services (Aloha Bus, Trolleys) provide inexpensive alternatives to cabs for areas beyond walking distance. Rental cars are also readily available nearby.The concierge service in the lobby is very good, and can arrange any type of trip or adventure you desire. Most trips/tours provide transportation from the hotel as part of the package.There is a Denny's on the first floor of the hotel that is a good option for inexpensive breakfast or lunch. Also, across the street in the Outrigger Reef, next to the upscale and very good Ocean House, is the Shorebird restaurant. They have a good breakfast buffett for $14 and a unique dining experience in the evenings. You place your order for steak, chicken, mahi-mahi, etc and they bring it to you very rare, in fact, raw. You then join your fellow diners around a huge grill and cook your entree. There is a chef there to assist if needed and all the spices, sauces, etc you can imagine are provided, along with a great salad bar that also includes hot side dishes. All ocean front. If you are an early diner, you can take advantage of their sunset special, which includes a half-pound steak and all the trimmings for $14.95.Several restaurants offer happy hours and sunset specials that significantly reduce the cost of dining out. For example, the Ocean House has its wonderful prime rib dinner for under $20 if you are seated by 6:00 p.m. Giovanni's around the corner has $5 pizzas and appetizers (plenty for a meal), the Yard House has half-price menu selections (not to mention 135 beers on tap), and perhaps my favorite, Top Waikiki (a revolving restaurant) has $4 martinis and $7 appetizers that are huge twice an evening, and the views are the same as they are for the $50 dinners. Duke's Canoe Club in the Outrigger Waikiki Beach is very good and reasonable, and has great beachside entertainment Friday through Sunday from 4-6. Their Hula Pie is to die for.Some of the excursions I arranged through the concierge were terrific: Germaine's Luau, Circle Island Tour and Polynesian Cultural Center, day trip to Maui, North Shore Beaches, Kualoa Ranch were my favorites. My favorite day, however, was renting a convertible and driving around the island, stopping at the East Shore sites, visiting Giovannis Shrimp Truck, seeing the big waves on the north shore.......all at my own pace.Again, my first trip to Hawaii, but it won't be my last.

This penthouse is on the 27th floor, same floor as the pool and also the same floor as a separate event venue. Check in was quick and we were able to settle in right away when we arrived. That was great bonus! All the staff are friendly and Mrg's Todd and Chadd were awesome for help when needed. We had been to the Imperial in the past and knew the perfect location it was in thus our return. It was our anniversary and that was the choice to rent the penthouse for something different!  The condo is renovated and has everything one needs with full kitchen and large lanai. I missed having another loveseat or couch to stretch out on so we ended up bringing a lounge chair from the pool area and putting it on the lanai. It was great to lie out and enjoy the view or just enjoy the morning sun before we hit the beach or shops. This unit being next to the pool has a door from the lanai to the pool however after setting the alarms off a couple times we chose to just use the regular pool entrance. It drew too much attention to us! (The alarms were to be turned off during pool hours) My husband used the gym daily and enjoyed that option. We did not use the hottub or sauna. Being next to an event venue is abit different however in saying that there was little noise and they were done early. It catered to mostly weddings while we were there and at no time was it open to the public which I had hoped. I did talk to crew while they were prepping for another event and was able to tour this beautiful venue. This venue is private and totally separate from the hotel itself. (OceansuiteWaikiki.com) He did state that October was completely booked for events and that we had missed out on the use of it being an open lounge to the public however November is a slow month and therefore it will be available then. It is very nice and beautiful to sit and enjoy the sunset with drink in hand. We were envious of the bar when we passed by as it was so close!!!The pool is as described on the 27th floor and it is windy however this time we stayed it did not seem to be as windy. We actually welcomed the breeze as it was a nice coolant in the heat. We have never been in October before so perhaps it is warmer than our usual trips in March/April. The pool has no ambiance, it is a basic pool on a rooftop. BTW there are towel chair covers for the lounge chairs and we only found out by commenting on them with other guests and they informed us they are available through housekeeping. That is not mentioned anywhere in the info packet. They are lovely and thick and much more comfortable than the regular pool towels. It would have been nice to have them in our condo at the time of arrival. This condo has its own wireless which was wonderful for me as I had my BB and my little laptop. I had difficulty initially accessing the wireless however after some help from Mgr Chad we worked it out. There was no cable hook up to be found and in speaking to Cindy the property manager it appears it may have ""walked:"" Internet is available for a fee (daily rate or weekly rate) in the owner's lounge. In comparison to other hotels in the area the price is pretty good although in talking to some owners they were disappointed with the additional fee. In the past when we rented from an owner the internet was free and those computers were always busy. This time there was nobody on the computers when we were there to enjoy the ocean view from the lanai up there. It is beautiful for sunset pictures! As also mentioned there is a Denny's restaurant connected to the Imperial and it was great for a basic breakfast after we did our beach walks. ABC is also right there and in the midst of an expansion. You will find that each ABC store is different and caters to the needs of the customers being served in each particular location of the store. Dont assume they are all the same as each one has individual differences and therefore they are all fun to peruse for that extra snack/drink/gift. There are restaurants galore surrounding the Imperial, Roy's, Ruth Chris Steakhouse, PF Changs to mention a few. Across the street is the Outrigger Reef which houses the Shorebird restaurant and the Ocean House restaurant. Both have great food and early bird dinner choices and on the oceanfront! We were in both places for Happy Hour drinks and early bird meals and enjoyed everything. The mac nut crusted mahimahi at the Ocean House was delicious!!! My husband enjoyed the early bird steak dinner that he can BBQ at the Shorebird! The Cheesecake Facory is a couple blocks down the street but be prepared for a long wait if you are going there for dinner. California Pizza Kitchen is nearby as well and they have great menu choices. This long strip is a mecca of great food choices and shopping! We have not been to Waikiki for 4 years and noticed a significant increase in shopping amenities if you like shopping. I liken it to the Vegas strip however no beach in Vegas! It is full of life and very busy. It was a great time and though it is city noisy the condo closed out all the noise when the doors closed. We did use the AC for the nights and that kept it comfortable for sleeping. We really enjoyed this vacation and the venue. We would certainly come back again!

Not gross, just ugly. Some rooms have weird blue carpet, pink toilets, dishwashers from maybe the early 80s, wicker furniture. The rooms vary - some are atrocious, some are quite a bit nicer. There is a small pool on the windy rooftop rather than a lovely pool with lounge chairs by the beach. But it is clean, the rooms are very spacious, there are a lot of suite options, the location is fantastic, some of the views are great and the prices are amazing. I don't typically spend much time in my hotel when I'm on Oahu so why bother with a more expensive place? The staff is pretty remarkable as well. Check in is always very slow - I have no idea why - but the valets are great and so helpful. But what impressed me most happened in December of 2008 when all of Oahu had a blackout. The Imperial staff was in the lobby handing out flashlights and radios and had an elevator operator to bring us up to our rooms. They were just wonderful.It's not romantic or beautiful or stylish.

It was cheap, clean-enough and in a central location. Because of the size of the unit & mini-kitchen, I wouldn't suggest having more than 4 adults in a 2 bedroom unit or stay for a long period of time. A little more about our stay; A total of 6 adults decided to catch a last minute flight to Oahu to see Pearl Harbor after spending 6 days on the Big Island. We booked one night (Sept 2011) in a HALA SUITE 2 bedroom, 2 bath unit directly with the Imperial Waikiki, at $210 per night. We didn't have high expectations of the Imperial after reading other reviews, but we chose this hotel because it was in a good location, cheap, knowing we would only sleep & shower here. Driving to the Imperial was a bit of an adventure, the hotel is situated in the city near shopping so lots of people walking, tour buses & one-way streets to navigate around. After finding the hotel, we handed the keys to the busy valet attendant (parking in the garage is $25 per day charged to the room). Hotel check-in was friendly & quick, our luggage was delivered to our room within minutes by a friendly employee. Our room was very basic, small, outdated (80s) and ""fairly-clean""....it definitely needed a good scrubbing. The kitchen area is NOT really a full-size kitchen as they indicate on the website however it had the basics: a mini-fridge, a really old full size stove/micro combo, coffee maker & almost no counter space....you wouldn't be able to easily cook a meal. Also, we were on the 9th floor and could hear the noise of the street (honking ect). The noise wasn't bothersome to us, but could be if you are sensitive to sound or are a light sleeper.After passing our bedbug/rodent inspection we all quickly showered (The bathrooms were tight, but not as tight as in europe and water was nice & hot) and were out exploring Waikiki within 30 minutes of our arrival. In the downstairs lobby there is a cheap ABC Store, a couple of cheap souvenir/clothing stores. Directly across the street from the Imperial there is the Embassy Suites & Outrigger hotels and down the street there were lots of high-end chain stores, Fendi, Cartier and chain restaurants including PF Chang, Starbucks, etcFor dinner, we ended up at the Shore Bird restaurant at the Outrigger overlooking the beach & Diamond Head. Drinks were nice and strong & the staff was friendly. We watched the sunset while eating a large salad buffet and steaks we were able to grill ourselves! After dinner we stepped onto the beach to watch the fireworks before returning to our room. The linens were crisp and beds comfortable-enough. The next morning we were up early & headed downstairs to Denny's. Sometimes Denny's is questionably, but the food here was good, coffee fresh and staff was attentive & friendly. Personally, I do not plan to return to the Imperial, or Waikiki at all. It was crowded & had the hustle-n- bustle of a big tourist city...... ...the peacefulness, beauty & tranquility of the other Hawaiian islands is sooo much better!",Denver,"morningbird303</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver</strong>",25,3.0

The first few nights were hot in the hotel because the whole air conditioning system was off. It did come back on after a few days, but it was still too warm. Then they decided to do some plumbing work and had the water shut off all night for a couple nights.

However, the worst part of our 10 day vacation happened at the Imperial. We rented our car for touring Oahu and stopped at the ABC Store located at the Imperial. I really thought the drive in front of the ABC was for ABC customers and did not see any sign posted saying for hotel customer parking only and did not realize there was the valet at the end of the drive. I parked the car in front of the ABC and our friend went inside to get a bag of ice and I got out and went to the trunk and get the chest ready for the ice. As soon as I opened the trunk, the young Imperial Valet came to me and told me to move the car. I said ""okay, just give me a second here."" He yelled, ""Move the car now!"" I had drink bottles out and started trying to get them together. I said, ""okay,"" but he continue yelling ""move the car now!""Of all my trips to Hawaii, I have never been treated so rudely.

I mean, it’s in a fabulous location, smack dab behind the luxurious Halekulani and only 1 short walk from the beach. It’s in the heart of Beach Walk which makes the location convenient for dining. We’d walk around the Outrigger Reef between the Army museum and be on the beach in less than 5 minutes, and the beach in front of Ft. DeRussy is wide and less crowded. The condo units are nothing fancy. I’ve rented various condos in various buildings over the years in Waikiki, and they all have been very similar, typically small and built in the 60’s or 70’s. Nothing different here. The Imperial is extremely clean and the kitchens are small but functional. You only get maid service once halfway through your stay, which is fine with us. Towels, including beach/pool towels are provided and you can swap your towels out with housekeeping for fresh ones every day if you want. Our trash was emptied quite a few times. There are laundry facilities on the 2nd floor and a fabulous owners’ lounge on the 26th floor.

The 1,2,or 3 bedroom options are probably a little better. The studio did not have a bed. It only had a roll away (which was probably from the 70's and completely uncomfortable) and this ""thing"" that came down from the wall that they call a bed. It's probably a full size bed type structure which was also extremely uncomfortable. That being said, I did not sleep very well during my stay. In fact, 1 night during my stay, I went on priceline and paid for a hotel room just so I could get a normal night of sleep.Some of the pro's of the property: the staff is good and the location is good (pretty central to everything in Waikiki) Con's: it's an aging property and it shows, towels (bathroom and beach) were disgusting, uncomfortable beds, cleaning service only once per week, and dirty furniture.When it comes to travel, everyone has varying opinions and I realize that. What I would suggest to anyone who reads this is: ask yourself ""have I ever stayed at a luxury hotel like four seasons, ritz, JW, etc?"" If you have, don't stay at the Imperial.

They partied like they were 14 years old and their parents had left them alone for the first time.

I would recommend the Imperial for families, singles, and couples because it is in a great location, has affordable prices and a very happy, knowledgeable staff willing to help day & night. They'll go the extra mile for you if it is possible for them the help make your vacation a happy memory.","San Diego, California","karenaclassic8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",19,4.0

My sister-in-law was in charge of securing our lodging accommodations, and she selected the Imperial Hawaii Resort. I was not comfortable about staying after reading all the negative reviews. As a back up, i booked a room at the Turtle Bay Resort. Well... to my surprise the Imperial was lovely. Nothing like the reviews stated. I immediately checked out of Turtle Bay and stayed with my family at the Imperial Hawaii Resort. Not a luxury hotel, but certainly not a motel (as some of the reviews implied). Awesome location. A short walk to the beach, and shopping (directly across the street from the Embassy Suites). Simply a nice hotel. We stayed on the 25th floor and our room was great. Sofa bed not too comfortable, but which sofa bed is.. The murphy pull out is very comfortable. Some complained about the noise... What noise? I didn't hear a thing. Yes.. an few delivery trucks, but it certainly didn't stop me from sleeping. I would certainly recommend this property. Oh... did i mention I work in the hotel industry. Keep in mind; it is very difficult to please service industry people because we expect so much. After all, we're constantly going over and above to exceed our own guest's expectations, and we expect others to do the same.

We got this unit through a timeshare exchange. We had low expectations of the unit since we knew it’s a much older building but with a great location. What we liked:Very convenient location for shopping, beach, food choices for a family. We went to Denny’s for breakfast and ABC store downstairs for snacks and supplies. We walked to the beach by Fort DeRussy or Waikiki area (in front of Sheraton very easily. Lots of high-end shops, souvenirs within 1-2 blocks. Royal Hawaiian Centre is also within 2 blocks. We went to the foodfair a few times to have noodles, Chinese, Korean and Hawaiian food. Because this is our second week in Waikiki, we decided to rent a car for a week. Parking at Imperial can only be done by valet. We paid $100 for the week. In general, staff were very friendly and always greeted/smiled at us. With the car, we bought groceries at Ala Moana and wet to other beaches (Ko Olina lagoons, Kailua, Waimea). If you are a timeshare owner, you have access to owner’s lounge on 26th floor. This is really spacious and had nice decor with a full kitchen, dining tables, lounge areas, and lanais. There is a full ocean view and good place to watch fireworks. This really came in handy on our last day after checking out to relax, eat take-out dinner and use the shower before our flight. We should have used this area more often since our unit was so small. If our unit was updated like the owner’s lounge, we would have enjoyed it more.What we didn’t liked:We were in unit 902 (1 bedroom) which faces east (view of Imperial Parc’s deck). This is a lousy view and we felt that we had no privacy. At any time, someone could walk onto the deck. We had to keep curtains in the bedroom closed most of the time. Sine this was over July 4, they were full and were not able to change our room. Mid week, they said a unit was available in a higher floor, but on the same side of the building. We would have to pay $50 cleaning fee if we wanted to move. We decided to stay. If you are booking at Imperial, you should request view of Fort deRussy side (west side). If you are high enough, you can see Hilton’s fireworks. If you end up on the Waikiki Parc side, request a room higher than 9th floor so you’re not so close to the building and right at their deck level.The unit itself is small. Living room contained a sofa and a separate Murphy bed. When the Murphy bed is out, the eating table and sofa/coffee table area is really cramped. The bedroom only had 1 night table and it was hard walking to the side of the bed facing the window. The bathroom was tiny as well. There is very little space to dry off and stand in front of the sink. Fixtures were all older. We thought we had a full kitchen but this unit did not have a stove/hot plate, only microwave, sink, fridge (with a freezer that did not work), coffee maker. This is fine for having breakfast, snacks and take-out food in our room. We have relatives who have timeshare in higher level units which have been updated and they have raved about this building. Our unit has obviously not been updated (but very clean) and really needed new curtains, bedding, carpet, bathroom fixtures. However, there is only so much you can do with the layout, which will always be small.Internet is not free. I think we paid $25 per week to use the wire connection in our room. Self-parking is not available, a bit inconvenient since you have to load and unload your car in the front drive way, in full view of everyone. Our son fell asleep in the car on the way back one day and we had to wake him up in the driveway (versus letting him sleep in the parking lot with one of us in the car).The small pool is on 27th floor rooftop is not inviting at all. After being at Hilton Hawaiian Village with their waterslides and large freeform pool, we didn’t want to even go into this pool. It was surrounded by walls with windows, so there isn’t much of a view. We spent most of our time at the beach so didn’t need the pool.","Vancouver, Canada","Pooky29</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",136,4.0

My Husband and I were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary. Had we looked to Trip Advisor to be the overall voice, or to a large degee, the final say of where we stayed, we would have missed the opportunity to save a dime, forcing us into a more expensive location, possbily ruining a wonderful week in Hawaii by spending more money on a room and forego the activities we had planned. Understandably, there are thousands who visit this time timeshare, and only a few hundred, who when dissatisfied over the slightest thing, are willing to write a review. Thankfully, we decided to be our own judge and are glad we took the steps to do so. The Imperial Resort is centrally located and situated in the perfect spot for all activities and shopping. We stayed in room 2508. Arguably, one of THEE most beautiful scenic rooms offered. The rooms are clean and not as small as the other reviews claim they are. Is the furniture outdated...not really. If you compared it to a 5star resort (SUCH AS TRUMP) possibly. It didn't have cascading water falls in the lobby and the rooms didn't offer large jacuzzi style bathtubs, but the feel I got when I entered the room, was simply...Hawaii. I didn't get the impression of being in a cheap hotel by far. It's valued high for the money you spend and comparable to being in any other resort in the area. Personally, I rate it to be a 4 1/4. Why the 1/4?? ...because my experience of timeshare resorts are slightly different in the fact that I'm used to having an ""in room"" laundry facility and at least ""starter"" coffee/tea packets offered in the room. Other than that, they accomodate everything I've seen stylish resorts to offer. They have in-room maid service conveniently offered on certain days and you have full access to xtra lines/towels during extended business hours. You have access to an in-house massage therapist and the spa area in very relaxing. I especially like the security they have with reaching your rooms, which means you need to meet your guest to take them to your floor. It takes a key card everytime you access the elevator...completely eliminating the possibility of children pushing buttons to see them light up. (Nice to know in a hotel that has 27 floors.) My husband is an Officer with the State of California and raved on that piece of security. His overall experience was so profound, he will be recommending this location to his friends and co-workers. (You would have to know my husband to know that's a BIG DEAL :) ) I suppose if you check the trip advisor for Trump Towers, they have bad reviews also...which goes to show, for the money, you just can't please everybody. I totally recommend you take the opportunity to see for yourself. In my opinion, You won't be dissappointed.","rancho cucamonga, California, USA","jourdanzlife</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>rancho cucamonga, California, USA</strong>",3,4.0

The Imperial just behind them, a small street and a public beach acess walk away. We went to the Halekoa(military hotel) parking garage to get our $16 a day, in and out priviledges, card key which allowed us into the Fort DeRussy self park, an easy walk past the Trump Tower and Embassy Suites to the Imperial building. We are not military. I did not want to pay the Imperial daily mandatory car parking valet fee. The short walk with luggage and kids not a problem.Entertainment Book Hawaii version has many coupons in the Waikiki area not just in the book but printable online coupons too. We dined at many 2 for 1's when we needed a break from dining in. Must print coupons before you leave home as there is no printer for guests to use, only for boarding passes at the front desk. Online access is $5.00/day from your room (own laptop) or in the owner's lounge.If you are a walker, Waikiki is doable with your own legs. My kids & I even walked to Ala Moana shopping center from here since dad had to go to work. If you are taking your car to hike Diamond Head crater parking fills fast so you need to go early. If you don't want to wait and have your car, take a stroll down the asphalt path to Diamond Head Beach (look where the surfers are carrying their boards) to pick up beach glass/shells. Nice view from the beach of the lighthouse. Rooms seem small but with kitchen, decent for Waikiki. Not a luxury hotel but better than budget, location a big plus.

My husband and daughter (5 yrs) and I enjoyed it very much. The location is A+, right by the Halekulani and Outrigger Reef, across the street from Waikiki Beach. Yes, it is true, the property is aging, but we did not find it horrible at all. Everyone (staff and guests) were friendly and in a good mood. We stayed in a studio - Murphy bed (nice and firm mattress) with a futon - my daughter slept there. Our view was of Lewers Street - great for having a beer on the lanai and people watching (3rd floor). The room had a good size mini fridge, coffeemaker, toaster and microwave. All utensils included. Room was very clean. So was the bathroom. Just had a shower stall, but no big deal to us. Good closet space and nice flat screen TV with DVD player, so we brought some movies from home to watch. We are originally from NY, so yes it was noisy, only really bothered us in the very early AM when trucks were making their deliveries, but you want to be up early anyway and enjoy all that Hawaii has to offer. The convenience of the ABC shop downstairs is the best. We did find the Walmart on Oahu and bought our milk, bread, beer, chocolates, from there b/c ABC is pricey, but in a jiffy, it was convenient. And don't forget to try those coconut M&Ms...you will love them.Ok, the pool is cheesy and the hot tubs were not the coolest, but you are right on Waikiki Beach - just go there! GREAT views of Diamond Head - your pictures will totally rock.The Imperial is also right on Beachwalk, this new pedestrian friendly area with shops and places to eat - very nice with all of the lit tiki torches at night. You can also walk to the Royal Hawaiian Center - more shopping and people watching. Great location the Imperial - you are in the mix of Waikiki Beach.I recommend that you eat at Duke's at Outrigger on the Beach and try Eggs n Things on Saratoga Ave - THE BEST MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES AND OMELET I have ever had in my entire life.All in all, I would stay at the Imperial again.

The bathtubs weren't very clean. The rest of the room seemed clean enough, but the room and furnishings are all very worn and aging. The location of the property was great. One block from the beach and right on the new beachwalk. We didn't open our balcony because of the street noise.

We used Hawaiian airlines for our inter island flight and they are an efficient outfit. We got a rental car through Hertz which was a Camry. I brought my GPS so finding the resort was easy, but once I got familiar with the area I would get off at earlier exits due to traffic issues. There is only valet parking at the Imperial which was $20 a day for owner/exchangers. We exchanged here through Interval International. The Valets do a good job and are friendly and will help with luggage to your room.The check in was quick and easy. They mentioned what any extra fees would be . We were given room 1105. The 11th floor room had a little ocean view between two of the resorts near by from it's small balcony. This is a 1 bedroom Banyon which has a limited kitchen. The resort is older, but the condition of the room was good. It is a little cramped compared to the condo style resoorts we're use to, but more than a usual hotel room. Kitchen had a small fridge, convection/microwave oven, toaster, blender, utensils and settings. The bedroom had a queen bed, end tables, dresser, and a HD flatscreen TV with dvd player. The livingroom had both a pull out sofa and a queen murphybed. A larger HD flattscreen TV and dvd player was in the living room. It also had a dinning table, coffee table, and dresser. The access to the balcony is through the living room. It has 2 chairs and a mini table. The worst part of the room is the small bathroom. It is small for one person and a little dated. There is internet hook up in rooms $5 a day or $15 for the week. The room gets a full cleaning midweek and trash is emptied daily. We had no maintenence issues during the week.Being a high rise, 27 floors, the elevator wait can be long at times. On the 26th floor is the owners lounge which has several balconies with great views of Waikiki, computers with use fee, large HD TV, daily paper, full kitchen for use, and pool table. On the 27th floor is the rooftop pool with vending machines and ice maker.. The pool is small and there is a lounging area. The hot tub was taken out and being renevated which closed the pool for 2 days. The lobby area on the first floor has several shops and activities desk. There is a Dennys and ABC convenience store just outside the lobby area. The key to this resort is it's location. It's in the Beach Walk Mall area. There are restaurants and shops of all types within a 5 minute walk. Within a 15 min walk you'll pass just about every top designer's store. Waikiki is 5-10 min walk from the hotel. You only have to cross 1 street. It's on the quiet end of the beach. There are venders where umbrellas, loungers, paddle boats, and etc can be rented. I found their prices to be high. Waikiki is a nice beach, but bring water shoes as it's rocky once you get in. Do not bring purses or any valuables to the beach. While at Sunset Beach a couple near us had their purse stolen. To save money we ate light in the room for breakfast and would grab a sandwich and snacks at foodland on our way to any beaches. For dinners we stayed away from high end places. Nothing stood out nor was any place real bad. As far as the north shore shrimp trucks I first tried Fumi's after to long a wait in line at Romy's. Fumi's was very good. We finally tried Romy's when there was a short wait. It was mediocre. After finishing we were still hungry and went to Fumi's for much better shrimp and slightly cheaper. Lesson learned, don't always assume the place with the bigger line is better. This also was evident with shaved ice. The famed Matsumoto's had large lines daily while Aoki's next door had lines not even half the size. We felt Aoki's was a lot better than Matsumoto's. We had a great week but could have used a few more days to see all that we wanted. Wished we passed on Dole Plantation since it's just a tourist trap. We prefered the northshore over Waikiki. The traffic in Waikiki is a headache especially in the evenings. Even walking at night the streets are very congested especially around some street performers/venders. Check out was easy with no surprise charges. I rate the room a 3, resort 3, location 4.

We exchanged our timeshare through Interval International for this resort. The Imperial is mostly a timeshare resort. However, some rooms are marketed through the Imperial website for individual nights. This distinction is important because it will directly effect the room that you receive. Timeshare guests get the best rooms. Our room was on the 24th floor. As previous reviewers have stated, you need to be on the 20th floor or higher to get a view of the beach. You will usually pay more for ocean views at resorts / hotels in Waikiki. So, we were exceedingly pleased with the view from our room. People who pay for their room by the night (non-timeshare guests) will not have a nice view from their rooms and should not expect one. Furthermore, as a timeshare property, there are certain housekeeping practices that take place, which are common to timeshare resorts. Rooms are cleaned once per week (even if you pay by the night) and if you stay less than 3 or 4 nights then your room may not be cleaned at all during your stay. Trash is emptied each day and dirty towels were replaced during our stay each day. From our room, I was able to pick up a free wireless signal for my laptop. Others may not be so lucky.This resort is not a 5-Star resort and does not market itself as such. It was built in the 1970s and has not undergone major renovations since then. However, small improvements have clearly taken place. Our unit had two LCD flat-screen TVs (one in the living room and one in the bed room), for example. The microwave was also new. Most of the other items in the unit (the carpeting, couch, chairs, stove, etc) were definitely more than 20 years old. Everything worked and was clean at check-in.The staff was very friendly. The valet parking is $20.00 per day ($25.00 per day if you not a timeshare guest). We thought this was a very good value. Our car was always brought to us within 2 minutes! If you just want to stay on the beach, then I would just take a shuttle from the airport. We did lots of sightseeing since this was our first time in Hawaii.As many people have stated in other reviews, the location is excellent. I would be happy to stay here again if I was exchanging my timeshare. I would not pay more than $150.00 per night, however, if I was paying cash.

One of the three elevators was down for rehab for the entire length of our stay while at the resort (there are 26 floors) which made getting to our room take a long time as the two operating elevators were often too full. The room was small and never got vacuumed for the four nights we were there. Also, the pool was very small, and the rooms had no view. Plus, if you do want to use the internet, you either have to go to the 26th floor or to the 2nd floor to access it which is a little hassle. However, with these things being said, the location of the hotel is great as you are in the heart of the beachwalk. In addition to this, we found the service to be very good at the hotel as well. For instance, every night whenever we returned to the hotel, the lady at the front desk (Tiana Lakanaria) always welcomed us back by name which made our six-year-old daughter feel very special. Tiana provided great guest service as did the valets.

Our room was a one-bedroom, two-bathroom suite on the second to top floor of the Imperial. We certainly couldn't complain about the size of the suite--it was spacious, and in addition to the bedroom and 2 baths, had a kitchenette (a trip to the market saved us some money on food), living room and dining room area. The room was relatively clean and the bed was comfortable. The furniture is defintely outdated and a bit tacky if you care about those things. We did not. We had a view of the ocean, which was partially obscured by a couple of other high-rise hotels in the area. The view was still pretty nice. Guests get access to the owners lounge which has internet access and there is a pool on the roof. The pool scene was definitely NOT happening and it was largely deserted. But since you're in Hawaii, why go to the rooftop pool, right? The hotel allows you to check out beach towels which was great.One complaint I have is that the housekeepers come to your room early. And in some instances, they kept knocking even though we had the Do Not Disturb sign up. Another complaint is that there is no parking structure or lot. It is all valet, which means you get charged a daily valet fee.Bottom Line: The Imperial is a decent stay (nothing special), but the best reason to stay here is that it really is surrounded by everything you want to see. Just one block from the beach, and two blocks from the strip. There are plenty of stores, restaurants, etc. to see within close walking distance.

I read in previous reviews that if you are a timeshare owner, you get better treatment. It doesnt hold true (at least for us). I went in with a positive attitude about this place and considered all the nice reviews posted on this site. I requested a high floor in advance and the lady I spoke to was very nice and said they'll do everything to try and accommodate our request. We were assigned a PALM unit on the 9th floor. I said to myself, well this isnt a high floor but I didnt say anything. My heart sank as soon as we opened the room. The room was not only very outdated, it smelled outdated too. Our room was on the back of the building which gave us a nice view of the back of the adjacent hotel and the parking lot next door. Needless to say, it was dark and gloomy. We immediately called the front desk to try and see if we can get a better room but the receptionist was not helpful. He told us that they are fully booked and that there is nothing they can do about it. They said to try and call again in the morning. I tried to not let it ruin our vacation so we immediately unpacked and started heading out to the beach. WHen we returned later in the evening and were getting ready for bed. I pulled out the murphy bed from the wall so my 5 year old can sleep on it. As soon as I did, the dust came flying out of the wall, when you peek in the space between where the bed was and the wall, it seemed like no one cleaned it for ages. The dust was very thick. Since we were so tired, we made our best to tough it out and get a good night rest. For the next couple of days, we pretty much just stayed out of the room, only to go back and sleep. On our third day, my husband went down to the front desk to see if they can change our room but the receptionist was again unrelenting, he said he cannot do anything. My husband asked if there's anyone he can talk to, it just so happened that the manager was walking by, he then explained the situation and he immediately resolved the problem. We got a KOA room on the 15th floor. I found it to be cleaner, brighter and much more roomier. It didn't matter to us that both showers didnt have enough hot water pressure (almost like a trickle) so we took semi cold showers until the hot water started running like normal again towards the end of our trip. Just as I was about to say, this place is not too bad, another incident happened. We came back to our room after spending time on the beach and found that the door was left wide open. It looked like someone fixed the beds but forgot to clean the rest of the place. The garbage was not picked up nor were our towels and toiletries re- stocked. They just made the beds and left. (Remember, if you're checking in using timeshare, you only get the room cleaned once a week). After checking the whole place, we found that nothing was missing (thankfully) but we called immediately and security was sent to our room and had our door re keyed. The hotel has apologized but it really just wasnt acceptable for us. The only perks I can agree to is that the location is very good. You're within walking distance of good restaurants and shops. Valet service was great and friendly, giving us good directions all the time. They have a good selection of DVD's in the lobby that you can rent for $3.00. ABC store is conveniently accessible downstairs. Other than this, I can't think of anything else that's nice about it. The hotel pool was small and looked like an oversized bath tub (about half the size of a normal pool and I'm not exaggerating). You're better off swimming in the warm, beautiful beaches. Hopefully, other travelers will have a much better experience (and better room) than what we had. Unfortunately, our experience is such that we probably won't come back here again unless they do some much needed work on their hotel.","Menlo Park, California","mdlvc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Menlo Park, California</strong>",9,2.0

Having the beach 1/2 block away was awesome, as well the bars in the hotels along the beach we so much fun, we met some wonderful folks including some military officers who were a gas to spend the evening with Aloha friends. We will return and have recommended this hotel to the sister and her family since it's so affordable.

Great service -we were allowed to check in early and had excellent service from the front desk and valet all week. They gave us great tips on restaruants and had even clipped coupons saving us a ton of money. Valet is extreemily promt almost too fast. We received every wake up call we asked for. The beds are comfy and it is nice to have a small kitchen and fridge. We stayed in a Palm unit with our 3 kids and felt the space was more than adequate and the extra bathroom makes a huge difference. Love the lanai's (Balcanies). We had 3 families staying in different units all traveling together and everyone had an excellent stay. Some units are more up to date than others but we spent most of our time at the various beaches and other activities out side the hotel-it's not the ritz, but it is great. It is a perfect base camp and we woke well rested every morning ready for adventure. The new shops and restaruants on Lewers street make this one of the best locations in waikiki. You have everything you need with in a few strides...literally. The beach is 3 minutes or less...enjoy all Waikiki has to offer from this perfect location! Nice pool and hot tub upstairs-the pool was a little chilly. Leave your beach towels at home you can check them out from the hotel...nice touch.

The kitchenette was well stocked and sufficient for 2-4 people. We went to the market and bought food and snacks for the week. The A/C worked well, and the water pressure in the bathrooms was good. The lanai was small, but sufficient with 2 chairs and small table and ashtray. The view was great! We could see the beautiful Halekulani across the street, and a patch of the ocean beyond.The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially the valets on the ground floor. We never waited more than 5 minutes for our car, and they were great with directions and maps. The elevators were in high demand, and we did wait a little while to get up to our room or down to the lobby, but nothing ridiculous.Basically, this was a great place for a nice laid-back vacation to Hawaii.

Room was on the 18th floor facing west. We had ocean and city views and Embassy suites hotel across the street. For un-obstructive views try to get a room above the 19th floor.The greatest asset of the Imperial is its location. It is centrally located to all the wonderful shops and restuarants of Waikik and directly across the street to the beach via the Holukalani Hotel. Staff is friendly and very helpful. While some may complain about the parking being $15. Parking in Waikiki is very costly and I found it to be reasonable with in and out privleges. We stayed 7 nights and just rented a car for 4 days more than enough time to see the other parts of the Island. The room was comfortable and equiped with a micro wave, sink and small refrigerator. While a cooktop would have been more convinient. The setup met our needs. The rooms do need some decorative updating thought they are clean and well kept. There is one TV with dvd player in the living room and murphy bed. A TV in the rather small bedroom would have been nice. the living room and bedroom each have balconies. There is a game room and computers (also wi-fi for those that bring there lap tops) on the 26th floor The game room also has large balconies which command incredible ocean/city lights/and mountain views. It is ideal place for viewing the Hilton's Friday night fireworks. the pool and jacuzzi are on the 27th floor. While the pool is small the 360 degree views are impressive. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend the place.Strongly recommend the shore Bird cafe at the outriigger adjacent to the Halukulani Hotel.

Lucky us!This building is older and reminiscent of an all-suite hotel that was converted to time-share condiminiums. The unit (we had the one-bedroom Palm with 2 baths) was small--one could barely walk around the queen-sized bed but it was freshly painted with new carpeting. The kitchen appliances and cupboards were in need of updating but serviceable.We never used the rooftop pool, which was smallish and subject to a lot of wind.Staff was pleasant and helpful. When our coffeemaker would not activate at 5:00 a.m., a replacement was delivered within 20 minutes. The reception desk personnel were cordial, travel desk personnel were generally good--and in one case great, and the Housekeeping staff in the linen/supplies room were wonderful.Speaking of supplies, we always carry a ""condo pack""--paper towels, toilet paper, salt and pepper, dish liquid, etc.--when staying in condos because we never know whether or how much of certain things will be supplied. At the Imperial, we never needed to dip into our personal supply because of the good initial supply and ability to replenish from the linen/supplies room.The location of the Imperial can't be beat! It is right next door to an ABC (convenience-type) store so most or all food stock is readily available. The new Beachwalk--stores and restaurants--is within a few feet, tour-bus pickup is close by, and it is a short walk to city buses. Of course the nearby beach (small) is within a short walk as are a lot of good restaurants, including those at the nearby Outrigger. A good walker can--in a two-mile stretch--get to great beaches, shopping, food, and transportation.We were happy to see a sign requesting guests to please use the ashtray on the lanai if they wanted to smoke. Evidently it worked because, contrary to my fears, we suffered through no smoke-related odors.The room itself was only average but the location and service brought my rating up to Above Average.

The Imperial is conveniently located on Lewers Street in the heart of Waikiki and is a stone's throw from the beach. Lower units have no view, but upper units have ocean and territorial views. The interior of the building is quiet and secure, and there is a pleasant rooftop view pool. Most of the units that I have stayed in are dated but in modest/serviceable condition with small kitchenettes. The rooftop community lounge/tv/free computer/pool table/kitchen has a spectacular view. As of this writing (11/15/06) I would *not* recommend staying at the Imperial (or any other Lewers Street hotel) until late 2007 or 2008. There is *significant* construction and new hotel development in the area and it is noisy and dirty. After the neighboring Trump Hotel is complete, the neighborhood (and my rating) will improve significantly. In the past I have paid between $85-125/nt. You may find more information at the building's website.As always; I travel to Waikiki several times a year, I can advise that Waikiki is a nice tropical urban adventure. The city comes with the negatives of a big city, along with the overwhelming benefits of a beautiful beachfront resort. Generally, everything in Waikiki is “a little tired” although there have been continuous improvements in the last few years. If you are traveling solo, take Roberts Hawaii from the airport for $10 (no rsvr rqd).Two or more people, take a taxi from the airport to the hotel (should be under $30). In Waikiki, nearly everything is walking distance or a short shuttle/bus away.

I bought a timeshare week from an owner who could not use it. I have stayed at several hotels around Waikiki. For the money, this is a great hotel. No, it is not a 4-5 star hotel as many other posters have indicated, but you are not paying those kinds of rates either- I would rate it as 3 stars. The rooms are dated & eventually need renovating in the near future. I was on the 15th floor facing Lewers St.. For the most part, the $460 million street renovation is done so the outside noise level is pretty much nil. The street is fabulous looking now. As far as I'm concerned, the room was clean, comfortable & much too my liking. Local calls are free. While I did not use the fully equipped kitchen except for the fridg, I thought it was very functional. The bed was firm & comfortable. There is TV with DVD player with a DVD rental plan in the lobby for only $3/day for 4 DVD's/day rental. Being a timeshare owners room, I was given full access to the owners lounge on the 26th floor. It had 4 desktop computers with full web access & unlimited wireless if you have your laptop with you, for free. It also has a pool table, big screen tv with several very comfortable black leather couches, full kitchen, & tables. But probably the best thing about it is the large balcony with an incredible ocean view. The front desk & valet staff were extemely friendly & helpful. The convenience of the ABC store & 24hr Denny's right outside the lobby is definitely a plus. Across the street the new Plaza has all the new high end eateries you can spend your money at if you dont want to use your kitchen. Location, location, location- you are only 100 yards away from the beach & in the thick of shopping. You are nestled amongst some of the most prominent & expensive hotels in Waikiki- Waikiki Sheraton, Halekulani, Royal Hawaiian paying much less. I consider myself pretty well traveled around the world & can tell you, for the money, it's hard to beat this hotel , all things considered. I was so impressed, I bought a week timeshare before I left. It's in escrow now. Just to give you an example of what a bargain it is, next door is the Fairfield timeshare hotel that was completely renovated inside & out is going for $21k to 41k versus Imperial hotel (exterior renovation only) @ $4k for a lifetime. If you are going to visit Waikiki every year & are half way interested in a timeshare program, I highly recommend you visit with Phil in the sales office in the lobby. You'll be glad you did. They don't have barkers standing outside their timeshare hotels trying to hook you in- they don't need it!","Reno, NV","LifestooshortUknow</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Reno, NV</strong>",7,4.0

I was there with my husband and 4 children. The pull down beds made it possible for all of us to stay in one unit (Banyan Suite)i sitting room, 1 bathroom, 1 bedroom, mini kitchen (we had breakfast in our room most days). Yes it was a tight squeeze at bedtime but with the beds up during the day there was plenty of room to move around. The bathroom was clean and well stocked. We didn't spend much time in the room we were always out at the beach or exploring - who goes to Hawaii to sit in the room? We had a view of the ocean between two hotels and that was all we needed to check the weather and beach conditions. Our Teenagers loved all the activity in the city and we had a great time exploring the shops and restuarants. The beach was wonderful lots of people watching! great sunsets every night. We went to the northshore as well and loved the big waves and lack of crowds was a nice change. The hotel itself was clean, centrallly located and the right price for a family of 6! Our kids enjoyed the hot tub, the pool; looked fine we swam in the ocean though. We had no trouble with maid service or getting fresh towels whenever we needed them. The staff were always friendly and eager to help, we were always polite and friendly to them too!!! Christmas morning Santa even visited our room with a gift! We can hardly wait to return again this year. It is a great place to stay for a family, the suites make it affordable compared to individual rooms for a family of 4 or more.","Calgary, Alberta, Canada","George H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Alberta, Canada</strong>",11,4.0

I have stayed in many places some wonderful, some not so wonderful...but NEVER have I ever seen anything like this that was paid for in my life. the unit was a two bedroom, because we thought we might stay in the city with them a few days....The kitchen was totally inadequate, although I would have never cooked in it because it was so filthy!The bathrooms.. were such a diaster that you didn't need to flush the toliet because they were running so badly, everything was gone by the time you got your pants up. In one bathroom the sink was literally held up with two by fours. Enough tiling was missing from the vanities that you could not classify them as tiled. In the one bedroom thee was a full bed and that was it..no dresser..no nightstands or lamps, just a overhead light. To get around the bed you had to do the side shuffle..so practice up! The matteras in both bedrooms were so bad, that no one sleep the entire time and when you used the let out couch, it was at such a tilt that it felt like you were going to slide right off. A trip to the jacquzzi..was only to find it with gren water. Trust me it was NOT sanitary. Yes, you only sleep there..BUT when you are paying money..it should be a place that is clean and that you can get some sleep.

It basically put a big damper on my trip. It all started with loose change and dollar bills going missing within our room. We could handle that, but what really upset me the most was how we were treated like complete dummies when asking for help within the lobby area (especially the front desk). The day-shift staff at the front desk wouldn't give us the time of day when we would ask for directions to our destinations or bus times. They would simply give us an ""I dunno, ask someone else"". They were not hospitable at all, they made me feel extremely uncomfortable. The same day-shift clerk even accused me of losing a DVD rental that we didn't even rent. Later that day they found the DVD which was rented to another room, and not once did I get an apology. We were given dirty looks by the two day-shift front desk employees everytime we stepped off of the elevator for the rest of our trip. Also, I put up the 'do not disturb' sign one day while we went out to the beach, and I came back to find the towels in my bathroom replaced. This instantly made me mad, as we had money previously taken. We spent the next two hours going through our stuff making sure nothing was missing. Then, to top everything off, our checkout time was at 11 a.m., but unfortunately our flight didn't leave until 9:00 p.m. so reluctantly we had to leave our luggage with the hotel. When we arrived to pick up our luggage, we briefly looked through it all to make sure all of our belongings were still there. We did this within 10 minutes, as our shuttle bus had arrived early to pick us up. Everything looked fine, until I realized at the airport that I didn't remember seeing the macadamian cookies on top of my clothing when I searched before we left. When I arrived, I unpacked my luggage and sure enough, I discovered I was missing them. It wasn't too important but it really made me mad. My mom had asked me to bring home a couple of boxes of macadamian nut cookies (which are not available where I am from). They had opened up my suitcase and taken the cookies out when we left our luggage there. I packed them on top of my clothing. They had the nerve to steal from my bag! For all those planning a trip here, be very aware of your possessions. If you unfortunately have booked here, you'll understand what I mean when I say they really lack hospitality.

I have returned to this hotel five times in the last seven years. Each time the service has deteriorated. This is the last time I will stay there. We left after three nights and checked into the Sheraton down the beach. We traded the view of the parking ramp for a view of Diamond Head and the ocean. The difference was total service and a view for a couple of hundred dollars more. It was well worth it. I have leaqrned my lesson.

Usually we stay in moderate priced hotels such as: Comfort Inns, Days Inns and Holiday Inns, so we are not the type of people who normally stay in the so called 'best' hotels so our standards for a hotel requirements are mainly for good value, clean rooms & bathrooms and good service for the right price. However, at the The Imperial Hawaii Resort...these standards were not meet at all.The Imperial Hawaii Resort is a timeshare...I want to caution people NOT to buy into this resort...if you want to even call it a resort. You can book suites here if you are not a member of the time share program---which I would not recommend.We stayed in the 3rd level of the suites in the 'PALM SUITE' with a price range of: $258-$271. This so called suite had one bedroom, which hardly had room enough to get around the bed from one side to the other. There was no dresser in the bedroom...the TV had to be mounted on the wall. The bathroom adjoining the bedroom was so small that only one person could be in there at a time. I could've washed my hands, used the toilet and washed my feet in the shower (no tub) at the same time if I wanted too--that is how small it was. The sink--had no counter area at all to it, therefore I had to place toiletries items on top of the toilet tank! There was only room for a glass near the sink which we placed our toothbrushes in. In the living room there was a pull-down double bed, and small. Also in the living room was a small dinning table that was virtually useless because when the bed was pulled down we had to shove the table up to the window just to make room for the bed. The coffee table had to be slide up to the couch to make room to walk around the bed when it was pulled down. The dinning chairs (no arm chairs at all!) had to be moved each night to the kitchen area to make room for the bed. Again, the TV had to be mounted on the wall due to limited space in the living room area. As for the so called 'full kitchen' this again was a joke for a suite at this price range. There was a very small microwave, dishwasher and only a mini refrigerator that bearly had room for a few items. There was a stove with an oven on top of it that looked like it dated back to the early 70's and didn't work well at all! A coffee maker was in the kitchen....but no coffee, sugar or creamer was provided. We had never stayed at a hotel, let alone a resort, with a coffee maker in our room and coffee was not provided. Even in a Comfort Inn...coffee, sugar, creamer are in the rooms that provide coffee makers...but not at this 'resort'!!! So bring your or plan on buying a small jar of instant coffee for $3.95 in the store and plan on drinking it black or you will have to buy sugar and creamer too.The second bathroom was not much better...the only difference with the size of it compared to the one connected to the bedroom was it did have a bathtub with shower. However, the sink-counter area was still no larger.As for cleaniless....we had to call housekeeping the minute we got into our suite because both bathrooms had mildrew on the tiles! Housekeeping did show up later that evening while we were at dinner and 'tried' to clean it...but there still remained mildew on many of the tiles throughout our stay. Mainly due to the fact that these bathrooms had not been cleaned properly in years and not renovated at all since the 70's when it was first built, therefore the mildew was so embedded in the grout of the tiles...it would not come out! The maid service here was only once in 7 days....therefore we only received clean towels once or we could personally go down to housekeeping and get more on our own! Remember...this is a 'resort' suite and with a price range of almost $300 a night and we had to get our own towels. Even when we called housekeeping and asked for more..they refused to bring them to us. The floors were only vacuumed once in 7 days. The linens on the beds were never changed in 7 days and the bed in the bedroom was only made up once. The pull-down bed was never made up or linens changed at all in 7 days! The bathrooms were only cleaned once in 7 days...other than the extra cleaning we got because of our complaint of the mildew on the tiles our first day, which the bathrooms should've been cleaned properly to begin with before we checked into the suite!As for location...it is a very good location for right downtown Waikiki shops and dinning. Only one block to many nice places, but there was construction all around the hotel, therefore making it loud with noise first thing in the morning till 5 PM at night. This, I understand, will not continue forever...but during our visit it was very disturbing.The walk to the beach was short...but the beach was the worst I have ever been to with major hotels right on it and located on Waikiki. The sand (if you call it that) going into the ocean was full of large rocks--not pebbles--but ROCKS! So large in fact that if I wasn't careful walking into the ocean...I could've turned my ankle. So needless to say, we did not swim at this beach...but ended up walking down quite a ways to a better beach. So much for a close beach area to our hotel---NOT! If you wanted to sit on the beach...that was limited too. The beach area was very small and was surrounded by a stone wall that went up to a walkway because of the massive erosion of the beach in this area. So sandy beach area was extremely limited.The pool area was not much better. There was no view of the ocean but out one window. There is a huge, tall brick wall all around the pool area due to the fact it is located on the roof of the building. I understand that this wall is necessary for safety sake, however with the safety glass or plastic that is available (and used) in many hotels with this same type of pool arrangement nowadays, I would think this hotel could've upgraded the pool-wall with this type of material instead of a brick wall with very small windows. I felt very closed in...even though I was totally outside and on top of a building! The only redeeming thing I can say about this hotel is on the top floor there is an 'owners lounge'--which only time share holders can use. Regular hotel guest are NOT allowed in this lounge. Our friends who we went with are time sharers. So we were able to use the lounge. The view of the ocean was wonderful from the lounge. Nice arm chairs...tables and couches were in it...also a pool table. We stayed here quite a bit because we felt like we had more room to move around in than in our suite...which is very sad in my opinion seeing the cost of the suite in which we stayed in! Even enjoying this lounge had it's downfalls...no personal privacy. Other time share members used it also (as they should) so we felt like we had to talk quietly as we would in any other public place.As I stated before, our friends are time share holders and traded their points to be able to go to Hawaii. They had no choice about where they could stay...therefore they had to stay at this hotel. Needless to say, they were shocked, disappointed and very embarrassed about this hotel, because they had invited us to come with them on vacation. They stated that this hotel was the worst they have ever stayed in in their 7+ years as time share holders. That is why I felt it necessary to warn others about this hotel. Even if you have no intentions in buying into the time share...please reconsider even staying here at all. It is a DUMP!!! I am not being hard with saying this...only truthful. I would've much rather been a few blocks further from the beach and had a much nicer suite or even a single room with 2 queen beds in it than have stayed here.Kay Mixson",CO,"monakayk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>CO</strong>",40,1.0

This is my 4th trip to Hawaii; previous trips were to Maui and Kauai. I was booked at the Imperial and was a little apprehensive about staying there after reading the reviews and receiving a letter from RCI about the construction around the resort. I even tried to change it at last minute, but was unable to. I am used to staying at 5 star hotels, but boy, was I pleasantly surprised. It was not at all what I expected. The front desk was very courteous; they even allowed us to check in early. The parking attendants were always very friendly. We had a one bedroom suite on the 12th floor. The room was clean...no mold in the showers; and even the murphy bed was comfortable. We did not have a full front ocean view but we were able to get a glimpse of it from the lanai. We were in a city high rise and most of the views were of the surrounding hotels. However, the sunset view from the 26th floor of the owner's lounge all but made up for it. The noise and construction was to be expected; and driving through it was no different than driving in Los Angeles, San Francisco or New York City. As for the noise, again, Waikiki is a city. If you've ever stayed in any other hotel in a busy city, noise is a given...even without the construction. We enjoyed our shopping sprees. The resort is conveniently located a few steps from the ""Rodeo Drive"" of Waikiki.However, no one goes to Hawaii to stay in the hotel. A short drive away from Waikiki on H1 will take you to the most beautiful beaches in the world. We found our own secluded beach spot and spent a day swimming and snorkeling...even saw a few sea turtles for free! Our last night was spent on Waikiki beach (which was 100 steps from the resort) watching the sunset and listening to the Hawaiian music being played at the Outrigger. It was such a wonderful vacation, we decided to purchase a timeshare week at the Imperial for 1/4th the price of other resorts in the area. It is an older hotel and not a 5-star world class resort; but once the dust from construction settles in 2007, the Imperial Resort will be in the middle of one of the hottest spots in Hawaii...a place that is definitely worth returning to every year.",Huntington Beach,"Luv2Viajar1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntington Beach</strong>",24,4.0

View was of a construction site but we had been warned and this was not a major issue as we spent most of the time away from hotel, just need to know this if you are looking to use hotel.Construction also going on around the hotel so some of the sidewalks closed.Biggest grumble was maid service only had one clean mid week and that was poor to say the least. Had to get fresh towels and as maid only came once also had to take old ones down. Lifts were slow and only three for 26 floors, pool was tiny. Plus was location it was as stated 100 yards from the beach and travel firm in hotel lobby provided good value and good trips (recomend full island tour with ENOA especially if you get Shannon as the tour guide). Also free scuba lesson given in pool which went down well with my son.Staff were ok but did not go that extra mile, did not seem happy in their jobs when compared to nearby hotels, even the few fish in the tank behind them looked fed up! Only one restauarant on site and that was a Dennys. ABC store was a bonus and the staff there always had a smile.Entrance of the hotel was a bit of a non-event, difficult to find on first night.If I was an owner here I would have serious questiions about service and standards this is the only time I have not had daily maid service.If you want basic standards then you will do fine with this hotel, island was great will go back and hopefully travel to other islands but will not use the Imperial again",,Camper32912,236,2.0

Yes the pool needs some work but hey your in Hawaii who needs a pool when you have the entire ocean at your disposal. As a parent of 4 children vacations are a luxury and I felt that we were well taken care of for the amount we spent. if I had wanted all the extras and to be treated like gold then it was up to me to pay the price. We chose to spend less so we got less and still had a wonderfull time. For the amount of time spent in our room, it was worth putting the extra money on the many other activities we enjoyed which I must say the hotel staff helped us arrange.

Also, the rooms I have had each stay have always been clean (no mold etc.) and the staff has been very helpful and courteous. Actually, each year I return , I see the same faces.

When we checked into our room, the first thing we found was that the bed pulled out from the wall. We shrugged it off, we were in Hawaii! Well we pulled back the blankets and sheets to find that the linens were dirty with hair, and God only knows what else (stains of some sort)! Imediately after my wife noticed a large amount of bugs on the counter in the kitchenette. I called the front desk and explained the situation and was told someone would be right up. About 45 mins. later I had to call the front desk again. We had just gotten in and wanted to go eat. Someone showed up about 15 mins. later with new linens, that I had to change, and bug spray, which they sprayed on all the dishes and silverware in the drawers, along with anything on the counters!!! All this was useless to us now until we washed it! Not long after I noticed that the room was not cooling down at all, the Air Conditioning did not work! I called the front desk again and told them that I wanted a new room, but I would wait until the next day. It gets better. I was going to make a cup of tea for my wife, when i went to use the coffee pot, There was a slimy layer of something in the pot. At this point my wife started crying and when I asked her what was wrong she said ""I hate this place."" Well that was enough of this. I went to the desk and told them that I wanted a new room Immediately. The manager took care of it, personally showing me the new room (it was an upgrade to a larger room with a real bed). She was not very friendly about this, as if it was my fault and I had no right. Well this new room was clean. But there are general things with the hotel that are terrible as well. The pool on the 27th floor is advertised as ""having a great view"" but there is nto a great view except through some windows that are about chest level in the wall. The Spa did not work properly and although the pool was clean, it was very small and old. Guest only recieve housekeeping ever 4th day, which would be okay if you could get towels, ect. You have to go to the housekeepers room and get them yourself if you need it. There is only dial up internet access. No breakfast included unless you go to the ""welcome"" that they have 2 times a week and have people try to sell you time share in this aweful place. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

We had set our reservations up a year in advance and asked for a room above the 17th floor. We confirmed this 3 times before leaving for our trip. When checking in we were given the lowest room they had. We asked the clerk why we were given the bottom floor when we had asked for a room which would be high. She was very rude and said that she had no control over the rooms we were given and that if we wanted to change our location we should contact a number she provided for us. It seems to me that she should have called them for us and asked for another room. After all it is her job to help the customer, but she did not. That was our initial experience, but wait it gets better. We go to our room which sits on top of the Dennys roof. When sitting on the Lanai you smell smoke from their chimneys. So get use to greasey bacon, sausage, and pancake smells. Then we look in the bedrooms. The small bedroom had no air conditioning and was about 95 degrees in the afternoon. When we walked into the room, we looked up and the ceiling had boards nailed to it that were water stained and held in with screws. The same thing in the big bedroom. Huge boards brown and water stained and black mold growing around the edges. Both bathrooms had black mold growing on the ceilings and on the walls. One bathroom when you touched the mold on the ceiling your finger went right through. The mold was the worst part of the rooms. It was scary not knowing if it was toxic mold or not. When sleeping in the big room the view of the ceiling was terrible because you were looking at the boards with brown water stains and mold. We told the manager at the front desk and nothing was done about this. Once again not even offering a different room. The noise at night is loud. There is a bar down stairs and music at top decimal. So if you want a good night sleep don't count on it. My kids said the room reminded them of a ghetto room.
