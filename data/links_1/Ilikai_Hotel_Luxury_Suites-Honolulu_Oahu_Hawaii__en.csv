There are privately owner units which are less expensive but may or may not be up to hotel standards. We stayed in a hotel run unit overlooking the boat harbour. Our unit 2539 was an immaculately clean studio with a full kitchen and full size fridge with freezer. No dishwasher. It had reasonable square footage for two, there was a sofa bed and a good size balcony for two. All in all it was perfect and if you open the drapes wide had a wonderful view.

It is the first ""High rise"" building in Honolulu. There are 2 really nice quiet pools and shops, a restaurant an ice cream parlor, and a SPA! I had the BEST massage I have EVER had here. I cannot wait to go back! The room was a really nice studio with a balcony that overlooked the Harbor, which was used for the opening shot for the TV show Gilligans Isalnd! . I would definately stay here again! The price was right and it is near Waikiki if you want to go there. There are really nice beaches just outside the hotel that were great and ""grown up"" . Shopping and restaurants are within walking distance. there is also bus or Uber service right outside the door! If you have a car, you have to pay for parking everyday it is Valet, that was the ONLY drawback to our stay and if you are into high end fashion the mall is just a few blocks away again I walked there, the shops in the mall were outstanding! Every high end designer has a store here. The food court is not like any mall food court anywhere, it has really amazing restaurants or just quick FRESH Sushi places .

But it was the least expensive of all the hotels we checked. Downside? Well, there’s a $28 daily resort fee no matter whether you use the amenities. Oh well...Valet parking is also $28 a day. But the valet service is fantastic. Never seen one as friendly and efficient. These folks hustle. Tip well. Tip often. Now, the hotel - historically, this was one of the first on the Waikiki beach, and was initially a bit of a white elephant. Ultimately they creatively carved it into 4 options, condos you could buy and live in, condos you could own but rent to “hotel” guests, straightforward hotel rooms, and hotel rooms you could own and ‘rent” to guests via the hotel. Now, reading some of the negative comments made it clear that some of the wanting experiences were in the condos, which apparently the hotel has little control over. So heating/AC issues, hot water, cleanliness, etc were less predictable. Somehow, we got a basic regular old hotel room, second floor, water view, balcony. The room was huge, clean, pretty modern, hot water and AC worked perfectly, quiet, good sleep. Absolutely no complaints, completely exceeded our expectations.

We live on an outer island. Anytime I approach any place to stay or write any review I always try to be open minded and not base my review on 1 or 3 problems as things are going to happen, inevitably, but there was a lot of issues encountered while staying here. Let me begin. The staff is rude. Likely because they deal with entitled tourists with bossy attitudes all day so as a local we always tip big and always apply a very gracious attitude to any staff. Our first incident was the night we checked in. My daughter, a cancer patient who is in a wheelchair loves to put the key in the door and open our hotel room. Well the guy bringing the bags intercepted the card as I am handing it to my daughter and says “ let me do it, I only have 2 mins left of my shift” stunned by his attitude I didnt say much and we even gave him a gracious tip as thought oh hell I’ll extend grace as the guy has probably had a long day. Further issues include housekeeping not showing up 6 out of the 12-13 days we were here. I would just call the first few times and ask for towels and our trash taken but by the 4th time I asked for a manager. No apology just asked if they could send someone right away. Great I said! That was 3:00pm and about 6:00 pm I guy comes with towels and gathers the trash. 3 hrs means right away. This happened a few more times. Valet, 3 times brought up the wrong car. Which was an added bummer as we were late to the hospital a few times. They are so adamant that we show our tag yet they bring you the wrong car. My favorite thing was the maintenace repair drilling into the wall with a power drill at 8:00am in the morning about 10 ft from our door. I was shocked that no one notified us to loud maintenance at 8:00am. I went out and asked the guy how long he would be until done with the sound. I did the online chat with guest services only to find out that this is normal repair times and that we should have been notified in advance if maintenance. Ummm no no notification and turns out we were not the only ones upset as several couples in the hallway asked if we heard the noise. I am just suprised by the customer service. I would not recommend this place. I wanted to like it but just can’t recommend it. pros: kamaiana rate, kitchen in room, several elevators, good location. Probably cheapest parking valet aroundcons: in addition to the above only one out of 5 dvd’s worked. We even had maintenance come check the dvd/playstation 3 which needed an update. He told us to let the front desk know the dvd didn’t work. As my husband turned it in and as he went to the bathroom I saw the front desk guy that he talked to go return a dvd to the machine rental. Same one who knows! We returned 4 movies for not working.Sleeper sofa has a lot of stains and the mattress is SUPER thin and uncomfortable. Also found crayons and a food covered paper towel the first night we went to use the sleeper sofa","Kauai, Hawaii","Morrismommy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kauai, Hawaii</strong>",21,2.0

I didn't stay in the penthouse where I read it was filmed, but still was excited to stay at the wonderful Ilikai Hotel. We actually stayed in a studio condo there that had a full kitchen and a fun bonus-we could hear (and partially see) the Hilton Hawaiian Village rooftop luau most nights! The Ilikai is a wonderful hotel in a perfect location-close to the Hilton lagoon (could see the Friday night 5 minute fireworks show from out lanai as well), only a 15 minute walk to the Ala Moana Mall, close to the beaches, but not right in the noisy busy line of Waikiki hotels. It's on a main street so easy to walk places yet still find your way back and also good The Bus access and very convenient ABC stores (love them!) to either side..The front desk staff and concierge were helpful & friendly, there was some free entertainment certain nights in the lobby area (or outside if no rain), and the Ku'Ai lobby shop staff were always very nice too. Staying here was one of the biggest reasons we had an amazing Oahu visit! The elevators were usually slow and no stairs were in sight, but that's just a small negative among an otherwise perfectly pleasant stay at this beautiful & comfortable, perfectly located hotel!

While our room looked nothing like the one pictured on trip advisor is was the same floor plan and somewhat similar view. We booked our vacay through Shell Vacations as we are owners in SF. Our options were a room on the 4th floor with view of the pools, ocean/beach (partial), and harbor or a higher floor (12th I think) with a city/street view. For us the choice was a no brainer and we really did like being on the 4th floor and partial ocean view.Staff was always helpful and friendly. Definitely gave us the Aloha Spirit during our entire stay. The advice and suggestions made on Trip Advisor were extremely helpful. If you haven't read through them....please do!To review the hotel room itself may seem more negative than it really was...but I am being brutally honest so as to not disillusion anyone about the room itself.We arrived on a Thursday afternoon and had already read about the bell hop/luggage attendent providing services at a fee. $2.00 a bag to us was an automatic given (in our opinion) and our bags were whisked away and magically arrived at our room in a timely manner. Our room wasn't quite ready (we arrived at 2pm) so we were directed to the hotel adjacent to the Illikai (The Modern) for a late lunch. The restaurants on site at the Illikai were not open at that time. The lunch at The Modern was adequate (very expensive for lunch) and we did not repeat our visit.We checked into our room shortly after 3pm. It most definitely is a studio room with a kitchen. There was no dishwasher and no garbage disposal. The garbage can was quite petite and had to be emptied (by us) daily. Our visit was for 12 nights and we were told we would have our room serviced 2x. During that service we were given a very ""bare bones"" clean up. We were given fresh towels at the visits. Garbage was removed. We did have to hang our towels and use a minimum of 2x to stretch through the time we stayed.The kitchen itself was serviceable. We were able to have breakfast several mornings in our room. The lighting in the kitchen was sub-standard as there was no lighting above the stove top and was made even darker by the microwave shelving with a noticeable down sloping angle. (LOL, we made sure to be gentle with the microwave for fear of it sliding off). The stove top and refridgerator were at least 15-20 years old. But they worked very well for us.The bathroom has no shelving or cabinet space for your toiletries except for a tiny space behind and above the toilet. If you have a hanging travel bag for your personal grooming stuff this is the time to bring or buy one =-) The bathroom is shower only there is no tub. This wasn't an issue for us as we prefer showers. There were broken tiles and missing baseboards on the bathroom floor.The main room with our bed was very comfortable. The most notable thing that my husband felt needed immediate upgrading was the size of the TV. Watching TV in bed was difficult as the TV was 32"". Sorry if that seems overly critical, but as sports fantatics ( there were 2 playoff games in the NFL while we were there) we weren't able to enjoy the games in our room and sought out local sports bar to watch the games.The view from our room was very nice. The view of fireworks was partially visible from our room on Friday night. They are quite loud. But beautiful. The following Friday we went down to the lagoon and watched the fireworks. Much better viewing.We enjoyed some of our meals at Cinnamon's. Service was usually friendly and quick. It depends on whether you eat at a busy time. My husband loved the banana pancakes. We also enjoyed the extremely brief walk to The Chart House for appetizers (pou pou plates) at sunset.We loved getting daily newspapers in the lobby and found that everyone we encountered at the Illikai was friendly and helpful.The distance from the Ilikai to Waikiki is walking distance. We were able to walk to the International Market Place and everything inbetween. The location of the Illikai made it quieter than the hotels on Waikiki Beach and we thought this a plus.We would definitely stay again.",,CynD55,1,4.0

We had a suite on level 22 facing the main road. The suite was spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable. The only complaint I had was that the rooms are not sound proof and you could hear car horns and sirens from the road. There is laundry on this floor but it's a $2.50 fee for each wash and dry. There are 2 pools, one is a tanning pool. The other is a larger pool with warm water. My son was told he wasn't allowed to jump in the pool but it is 8 foot on one end so that means the only way in is to use the ladder which people tend to hover around. I found the staff and reception to be efficient but not very informative. We had no idea where the pools were and had to ask other guests as there is no signs in the lift.The luggage desk was never attended. There is a phone that you call to ask for luggage to be stored but we had to call twice before anyone came. When we wanted to pick up our luggage they were so slow that we decided to wheel our own luggage to our room. On Friday night there is free entertainment at the hotel courtyard area. The reception staff didn't inform us about this but there was a flyer in the lift. We had ice cream at Dave's Ice cream and the lady who works there was so friendly! Lovely lady and delicious ice cream. The convenience store is also very big and has a lot of variety.

Unfortunately the balcony door was not able to be left open during sleep time due to the street noise of cars and people, and the studio was on Floor 14. 5. Day 4, the toilet overflowed, with use of the toilet appropriately and only using the toilet paper provided. Fortunately, I had many of my family also in the hotel and had respite when required. I was very disappointed with this studio condo and paying $2400.00AUD for the week, I do expect clean and up to date bedding and a toilet that functions.

The IH stove with 4 burners (2 larger in front and 2 smaller in rear) was good enough to cook any type of meals, as well as full sized microwave, refrigerator, toaster, kettle, etc...everything was there, which met our needs completely. As we are a party of four, we decided to request an additional rollaway to get 4 beds in total for $45 per day, which was also a nice choice for us.

Might as well label both as relaxation pools. In the large pool, you cannot jump in. I’m not talking diving, or cannon balls, but literally, no jumping. As I heard another guest say, “what’s a pool for if you can’t jump in?!” No floaties, no noodles, no small tubes. No playing catch and don’t even think of throwing a diving ring, because it involves throwing. Btw, the water smells like gym socks. However, the water was probably warmer here than at any of the other pools we tried out. It felt like hotel guests were treated second class. If you don’t want children or hotel guests, don’t rent out rooms. The hotel rooms are on floors 4 or lower and 24-29 I believe. The rooms are okay. The carpet is thread bare in a few places, but they are kept clean. If you get a room facing the street, it is LOUD. A lot of sirens, horn honking, etc. The hotel itself is quiet though.

Thank you a million times. A little backstory we booked our entire 6 day trip in Oahu at a different hotel and two hours after getting there we ran for hills, it was a total dump. With bed bugs, dirty weird stained carpets and all. That hotel had decent reviews so I was in complete shock when we checked in and saw it’s dismal state.

My husband and I were on the brink of changing our flights to just go back home.I remembered the Ilikai because I stayed there for a week back in 2016 and had all pleasant memories. We decided to drive to the hotel and ask about pricing instead of going through Expedia and just talk to someone in person to try to salvage our honeymoon. I figured I had stayed here before and it was great so something familiar was very comforting. Mark at the front desk was that guy and boy did he deliver. He first heard our story as I inquired about a room there and he was very genuinely upset for us as well with our whole fiasco. He let us know about a last minute deal on an oceanfront room and we jumped at the chance. He was phenomenal, we got a beautiful room on the 23rd floor and he even had a bottle of champagne sent up to us to celebrate our honeymoon. Mark saved my night and my trip, no more frustrated tears just mimosas!

The toilet/plumbing was a bit smelly and we ended up buying some toilet cleaner to see if we could get rid of the mild smell that was in the bathroom/toilet.

We fortunately able to book early checkin, apt 1336 .. which was great considering 0600 arrival at HNL. First impression... a bit dated! Kitchen was well equipped and bathroom was adequate. Locale great.Our view was over lagoon, so we had a great view of fireworks. I will admit I found the bright lights from the Hilton a night, a bit much.. closing blinds minimal effect. I think I would prefer marina view next time.Our bedroom (twin) and lounge area a different matter. I found the covering sheet on my bed had been stained/marked, which wasn’t immediately noticed as covered by decorative cloth. Our fake timber flooring had been repaired however it was very obvious and our lounge (was sofa lounge) was rather disgusting. It was badly marked and stained, it truly needed a good clean. We simply didn’t like to sit on it. Probably worse was the aircon. There were instructions not to go below 72f. Sorry, but that is a bit too warm to sleep thru! It was one of those noisy old style, at floor level. Totally ineffective and most definitely needs replacing.We noticed during the period other apartments better appointed, so this experience wouldn’t put us off staying here again. We just need to find out when renovated, hopefully we will pick better next time.

She confirmed it was a bed bug but did nothing about it. She questioned why I was bringing it to her attention on my check out date. I explained that was the first time I saw one. She basically accused me of “planting” the bed bug. As if I have the resources or desire to do something like that. I was treated with total disrespect. I had to catch my flight home so I didn’t have time to inspect my luggage or belongings before packing. It was a total inconvenience for me upon returning home to have to leave my luggage and content in my backyard until I had time to thoroughly inspect every item for bed bugs.

I explained about changing the date online. I had a 45 minute phone call with a manager from the hotel about the charge. He did not care that I had a history with the hotel nor that he risked losing a customer nor that I had stayed there later that week. He showed me no ""aloha"" spirit.

This was watch by the security guard on duty at the time of the incidents, which was at least 4 times and they did nothing to help, thankfully the general public was of help in holding the doors open when she entered as I was not always with her.

The only negatives that I would say is that the carpet was pretty old and missing in spots. It would be great to see this replaced. One of the sliding balcony doors to the back bedroom was also not locking. We meant to mention it when we checked out but forgot.

All transactions took place online and after booking, a reservation summary was emailed to us with all of the information needed for our stay, including a link to make our room payments. We were able to split the payment and have the couple that we traveled with make their share of the payment through the link. I had one communication through the comment section on their website promptly responded to before we booked. Thought it was interesting that we also received, at the time of the booking, a key code for the room and the time it would be active.When we arrived at the hotel, there was no check-in process or need to go to the registration desk as we simply went to our room and used the key code. There are several elevators servicing the hotel with very short wait times.We had a 2 bedroom unit, 510, which would have slept 6 due to a sleeper couch. Our unit had a small kitchen (room for 2 to move around) that was well stocked with cooking utensils and dishes/glasses. There was a refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, stove, small sink/garbage disposal, and coffee maker. A bar that had one stool separated the kitchen from the living space. On one end of the room was a dining table with 6 chairs. In the middle was a leather couch, coffee table, small end table, tv cabinet, and a wall mounted flat screen tv. In the other end of the room was another small round table with 4 chairs. The 2 bedrooms were on opposite ends of the room. The master room was a little larger than the other bedroom with a dresser, nightstand, tv, king-size bed, closet space, bathroom, and the small balcony access. The other bedroom had 2 nightstands/lamps, closet space, queen-size bed, tv, access to the unit bathroom, and access to the main balcony (which had a better outside view.) There wasn't much room between the bed and wall mounted tv in this room, so we placed the 1 barstool under the tv so we wouldn't bump into it. The large balcony had a small table/4 chairs that faces the marina/ocean. The smaller balcony faces another hotel/town and had a smaller table with 2 chairs. Both bathrooms had plenty of towels and only soap was provided.The large windows in this unit give you a nice view. You are asked to turn the AC off when you are not in the room, but it works well and cools the room off pretty fast.Cinnamon's is the restaurant/bar on the lower floor and we enjoyed several meals, including the buffet, there. There is an ice cream shop, gift store, and a few other specialty shops/services located on the floor also. Although we didn't have to deal with the reception desk and concierge, I had questions for both, and they were very helpful.The swimming pool was clean. Towels are provided at the pool and there are several lounge chairs, but they do fill up fast during the day. We were still able to get chairs when we went. The Ilikai is in a nice location and a 15 minute or less walk can get you to several places to shop or eat. The lagoon and beach are only a few minutes walk away with Diamond Head Crater viewable from the beach. In our unit was a beach chair and mat which we made use of. Tour buses and trolleys stop in front of the hotel. There are also some businesses in the marina that provide excursions.I would suggest and recommend Waikiki Trolley (hop on/hop off) as a cheap way to get around if you don't already have plans. They have several different lines that take you different places for sightseeing.Would definitely stay at the Ilikai again, probably trying a different unit though.","Indpls., IN","JonInIndy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Indpls., IN</strong>",186,4.0

Our condo 1126 was a fantastic 2 bedroom apartment, with views of the lagoon/ocean and city/mountains. We love having the 2 balconies and used them both. Having the city views was lovely and that balcony provided the wind breeze which helped cool down the condo. The a/c unit was effective but really noisy. The unit had everything that we needed and we made use of the kitchen cooking half of our meals for the 2 week period. Ala Moana Shopping centre was fantastic and a quick 10 min walk got you there. There was a Foodlands food market where we got our food. You don't see the Hilton Friday night fireworks, from this unit, so If your wanting to see them, best to walk down to the lagoon. We had 6 people for our stay and 1 person was using the sofa couch to sleep. It is not the large corner sofa couch shown in the photos, which looks lovely and comfortable. Its a very hard uncomfortable sofa couch, which has bars and springs digging into you each night. So we were very dissatisfied with this. Having said that, it was the only disappointment in our condo. We booked it through Waikiki Beach Rentals and they were great to deal with, making it very easy. The first two numbers (11) is floor level and 26 room number. The location was fantastic, easy access walk way down to lagoon and beach, which we used daily. And an easy walk, either towards Ala Moana Shopping centre or the other way towards Waikiki Beech for shopping and dinning. Staff at reception and bag counter were all friendly and helpful.

It has two bedrooms, each with a queen bed, a kitchen, living area. It is a corner Condo with good views. The deco is pleasant and comfortable. The Ilikai caters for families and you notice the numbers that churn out of the lifts. The condo was quiet though. The Ilikai is close to a beach and lagoon. It is a ten minute walk from the beginning of the main strip.Negatives are: curtains are beginning to tear due to sun damage. Chipped tiles on the floor, though they are not sharp. We arrived to find a blocked toilet that was in the process of being fixed. It didn't help our initial impression to find a bad smell and a toilet removed from the wall. When i expressed my disappointment to Bert the maintenance manager, he was borderline rude in response. This didn't help. Where we understand that these things happen, we should have at least been called and advised that our room wouldn't be available for at least an hour or so while they fixed the toilet. Maybe a voucher for a drink and we would have been happy to sit waiting. Instead, we arrived to the smell and a toilet disconnected from a wall. The clean afterwards (which i had to ask for) was adequate, but they did not wash the floors as I would have expected.I went back through the website (Waikiki beach rentals) and they advised to contact the owner. I did and have heard nothing back from him.

The location was ideal being in between Ala Moana Centre and Waikiki which was a 15-20 min walk or a $2 ride on the trolley which are at the front. The pool was nothing special but we used the Hilton Pool most times which was open to the public and was a close walk. We were lucky to have 2 Fridays there and seen the fireworks. We hired a car for 2 days and was helped by the lady in car rentals in the hotel. We got to see the whole island over 2 days. Would recommend going to Dole Plantation, Kualoa Ranch to see where some movies were made, Pearl Harbour & Waikele Premium Outlets for shopping.

We like the Ilikai because it is so conveniently located but at the same time we're not Waikiki overwhelmed. Its the most uncrowded resort on the crowded Waikiki beach. Parking is valet only and expensive, but since they don't have their own parking lot, that's just way it is. In general, we bus and walk everywhere from here. The sunsets can be spectacular and with the Hilton literally next door, there's always something exciting going on.

Be sure to get a room overlooking the ocean at the back of the building. The street side can be very noisy. It is a very easy walk to get into the heart of Waikiki. Every Friday night the Ilikai sponsors a free Hawaiian concert in the Plaza @the Ilikai, followed by a magnificent display of fireworks.

The hotel is Y shape, and there are two different types of ocean view suite, one is facing the Hilton lagoon and the ocean(pic 1), and another one is Sunset suite(pic 2). There is firework (5 minutes) each Friday night at Hilton lagoon. If you choose that said, you can see it(pic 4). The only issue I have is the view is somehow obstructive by Hilton. If choose sunset ocean view, you won’t be disappointed by the beautiful sunset(pic 5 is taken from second floor). The room is very spacious (pic 3 is from internet but is exactly what we have, at least 500+plus square feet). Enough room for my kids to play here and there, which is much nicer than staying at the regular 300 square feet hotel room. The sofa can be turned into a queen-size sofa bed( a bit soft though). I read some review about the elevator issue. For the time we stayed there, we never need to wait for elevator for more than 2-minutes, but the ride can be very noisy. The staff is friendly and helpful. The kitchen equipped with essentials. The toiletries is not too-notch brand and it’s fine. There is a convenient store onsite and the price is reasonable. Of course ABC store is nearby where you can find anything, even cheap snorkeling gear. (12.99 per set) if you rent a car, behind the hotel, there are plenty of up to 10 hours parking space ($1/hour) so you can park overnight. During day time, near Hilton lagoon, there are a few free and up to 6 hours parking if needed (I guess it’s mainly for people visit the beach). Hotel valet parking is $28/day. For shopping, I found a few interesting stores in the nearby Hilton village. I think the building is a mix a hotel and time share, everything above 22 floor call luxury suites, and they also offer partial ocean view at the lower floor (2-6 floor I guess). Better to verify with them when you book your trip. Lastly, the ocean facing side of the hotel at 20 plus floor is not noisy, this might not be true for the city facing site.","Boston, Massachusetts","Cathynchen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",10,5.0

I said I wanted to cancel and they said that you have to pay a penalty of more than $1,000 for cancelation within 1 month. I called again and they told me that there was nothing else, because I was in an “economy” room. I asked for an “upgrade” and they finally assigned me a better room that I could see by looking at the pictures. They charged me an extra $200. Hotel is old (built in 1964) but well maintained. During our stay, one of the 5 elevators stopped working and lasted for at least a week and was out of order when we left. The apartment that we got (1617) is in very good condition, but it is a studio. The upgrade may be that appliances are newer than the original one, that had appliances from the 60’s or 70’s from what I could see in the pictures.

We were on the 23rd floor in a 2 bedroom suite. The suite was spacious and comfortable with 2 large bedrooms and 2 decent sized washrooms. There were also 2 great balconies and we had a nice city and ocean view. My eldest daughter took the pull out sofa bed which was very creaky,and worn. She complained that she felt the bars and springs through the thin mattress. I did call down to ask if they could provide any sort of extra padding or bedding but they were unable to assist.The kitchen was well equipped and we bought groceries from the nearby ABC store for breakfast and snacks.The service was okay...housekeeping will not clean the dishes and there is no dishwasher in the suites. We even called down to say we would pay extra to have this service but they would not accommodate. The table was left frequently unwashed or cleaned and they did not provide cleaning tools for us to do so on our own. Not that we would really want to do that on holiday anyhow.The beach is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and there is no beach service. The front desk does provide beach chairs and towels but you must carry them down on your own. Also, the chairs are not loungers and are pretty uncomfortable. We schlepped them down to the beach the first day and then rented loungers and umbrellas from a beach vendor after that. The pool is small, definitely not glamorous in any way. It was the type of pool you would find in the basement of an old condo building. I would have expected something much nicer. We barely spent any time there. The little grocery shop in the hotel is outrageously priced...I think I saw a box of cereal for over $10.00!! We only had one meal in the hotel restaurant and it was mediocre. However, with all of that being said...the price of this hotel is right. As long as you know what you are getting.

We have stayed at The Ilikai previously and we understand the units are showing signs of wear and tear and that the fittings are old and worn but we like the location .On the 4th day of our 12 day vacation at 4.30pm the glass shower screen shattered explosively as I was exiting the shower stall. The door was a 2 section sliding panel arrangement . I sustained deep cuts to my hands and cuts and abrasions to my arms legs and body.I was in shock and thankfully my sister was there to assist.She immediately rang Scott from Waikiki Beach Rentals who said we needed to ring security ( he did not enquire as to my welfare at any time during or after) . Upon securities arrival they indicated it was beyond their scope and called the paramedics . They arrived within 5 minutes ( a great service) and proceeded to dress my woulds ,bandaged my heavily bleeding hands , administer pain killers ,advise I would need to visit a hospital and to have a tetanus shot . I was not to put my hands in water. I also required a course of antibiotics .My holiday was ruined . I had very limited use of my hands which made hygiene a challenge . My sister became my carer.I was constantly in pain. I was embarrassed by my heavily bandaged hands and nervous and anxious around people in case they should bump my hands .When I contacted Scott from WBR and the owner of Unit 1738 in Japan by email 2 days later their response by email was that I was 'lucky' I wasn't being charged for the shower screen and that ' we wanted to charge you but realise it was an accident'. Also that I should have reported the problem to maintenance . There was no problem until I was standing in the shower cubicle covered in blood and shards of glass.I am not a shower maintenance expert and so can't predict when and old and worn shower screen might fail.It was also suggested I ' did' something to the screen or was too rough. I am 61 ,my sister 57 ,we way 52 kilo and 53 kilo and are of slight build . How much damage could we do???No offer of a refund , accommodation in lieu , change of room or medical expense reimbursement was made . I found the attitude of Scott from Waikiki Beach Rentals and the japanese owner of Unit 1738 to be appalling at best. They insist we were responsible for everything in the unit regardless of age were and tear etc . When an accident does suddenly occur they point to maintenance and the lack of reporting . One needs a crystal ball! My welfare seemed of no concern and they would take zero responsibility.I am still very nervous around glass doors and still have intermittent pain in my hands .Personally I will never book this unit or in fact any unit under the care of Waikiki Beach Rentals .I just would not feel safe or protected .",Sydney,"dancermissa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",15,1.0

It had a great kitchen that helped reduce the number of restaurant visits which have become very expensive since our last visit to this hotel. The room was sunny and bright and had a commanding view of the beach and Hawaiian Village lagoon. The view from the room's lanai of the Friday night fireworks display was breathtaking. It is important to know that many of the apartments are privately owned and may not be as comfortable as this suite was.There is a large patio off the ground level with lush plants and water features where one can sit and enjoy a coffee or ice cream from one of the hotel shops and read or check your email (the wifi throughout the hotel is good).There is entertainment featured down on the patio on certain nights. One night the quality of the performance was particularly good and was comprised of a single musician with a complex array of gear providing recorded tracks to which he sang and played his stratocaster guitar with impressive skill honed over 40 years as a local musician. There are also two performance stages in the Hilton Hawaiian Village next door with live music most evenings but the quality of the musicians had diminished since our previous visits there.The staff throughout the hotel and in the various shops located on the main floor were pleasant and helpful. Our suite and the main floor public areas were kept very clean and tidy. There are two pools and a gym attached to the hotel and the beach is a stone's throw away.

Beach out the front looked nice but needed thongs to get in the water as 2 inches deep and all stones in the water - thought I was in Nice in South of Frances. Everything in the apartment broke everytime we touched anything, bathroom was so old, kitchen appliances included cutlery was ancient and all looked rusty and grotty. Sofa bed constantly creaked all night long, double beds - dont think they were double more like 3/4.

There are places nearby to shop for food. The car valet services although a bit pricey was very convenient. Never had to wait more than 2 minutes for the car. All hotel staff whether at the front desk, at the pool or house maintenance were very courteous and efficient. Checking in and out was a breeze. We were never kept waiting for anything more than 2 minutes.

Of the 3 lights for the bedroom & lounge area, one didn't have a bulb, one was so broken I felt unsafe using it & so unplugged it. The mechanism to operate the plug for the bathroom sink was broken. The kitchen sink could only be stopped dripping by standing on one leg & holding your tongue a certain way. The kitchen & bathroom areas need major renovation - e.g. really old cabinetry & fixtures, some old water damage visible with substandard repairs obvious. One electrical plug in the kitchen was so loose it wouldn't hold a plug. The kitchen sink plug barely held water long enough to do very few dishes.Of the other amenities - there were several bathroom towels, but only one beach towel. There were 2 body boards, one of which was broken.A suggestion - the owner/operator could provide a laminated sheet with details about the venue - e.g. where the coin machines are located for the washer/dryer, where to put the garbage out & the fact that the hotel recycles some materials.The condo could also do with a minimum of light blocking curtains.

So it isn’t unusual that the Ilikai is, too. I stayed in a room here via VRBO. I realize that the room and how it is represented is dependent on the owner of that room. So in all fairness, I am going to review the property as a whole. The Ilikai isn’t hard to miss. It’s pretty monumental. The drive to the front is right off a busy street. They have valet parking at $28 a day. That being said, it offers in/out privileges. We took advantage of this because parking is a headache. The valet service was very quick, and we got to see the same faces quite often. At times the drive was congested, but not at the fault of the Ilikai or their valet parking service. The entrance is very pretty and well taken care of. The lower floors, where the shops are is clean and tastefully decorated. One of our favorite places to try was Cinnamon’s during happy hour. The main hallways where the actual hotel/condo rooms were are clean, somewhat dimly lit, but well taken care of. The walkway toward the marina, Duke’s Lagoon, and other areas is nice to have. Very well taken care of and managed. We didn’t use the fitness facility or pool, but noticed many took advantage of them. The walk to Duke’s Lagoon, the Marina, and Hilton is super short! Really loved the proximity to so many things. We walked to the lagoon to watch a sunset, eat Gilligan’s (shrimp truck), and watch the Hilton fireworks show on a Friday night. Are there other places that appear updated in comparison? Sure. But you’ll also pay for that. Would I stay at the Ilikai again? Absolutely.","Hot Springs, Arkansas","Deidra M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hot Springs, Arkansas</strong>",89,4.0

We stayed at the Ilikai in the ""Luxury Sunset-Ocean View"" room. I'll start with the positives:The lobby and the various Ilikai shops were clean, modern and were decorated distinctively Hawaiian Christmasy. Rob, checked us in and he was pleasant and professional. Upon entering our 22nd floor room we noticed the kitchen and bathroom were newly updated. The bed was very firm. And probably the best thing about the room was the view. Although we expected an unobstructed view of the ocean, our balcony actually had a partial view of the ocean and a full view of the harbor. It turned out to be better than we expected. This hotel is on a main drag for shopping and is a few blocks away from the beach and right in front of the harbor.Now the negatives:This is not by any stretch a luxury suites hotel. This hotel is terribly old and it needs a thorough (and I mean THOROUGH) cleaning! The walls and carpet in the elevator lobby on our floor were filthy. It was hard seeing so many people walking around barefoot (as is custom here) on this nasty carpet. This room is not a suite. The bed, living area and kitchen are all in one room. It's more like a studio condo. When we walked in, the first thing we saw was the newly updated kitchen. But as we went in further, we saw a worn and absolutely filthy carpet with holes. The curtains and headboard were stained and filthy. The sofa and chair were stained and filthy. The sofa tables were scratched. The night tables were dusty and the lamps had cobwebs. It was like after they updated the kitchen and bathroom, they didn't notice there was another part to the room. It was really very disappointing for the money we paid. One other thing, they made an announcement to evacuate the bldg because a fire was reported. We were heading to the stairwell when another guest came out and said they were on the phone with the front desk who said it was a false alarm. My husband called down and was told the same thing so we stayed put. They NEVER made an announcement that it was a false alarm or gave the ""all clear""! In fact they never made ANY announcement after that. There were people still coming out of the stairwell 20 minutes later. Misc. Issues:The door to the room does not pressure close all the way. We didn't hear it click when we entered and when we looked back, the door was just slightly cracked. You'll need to push/pull it close to make sure. When we left the room we noticed several other rooms' doors weren't completely closed either. They have Spectrum cable. Unfortunately you can't access most of the regular channels. They are ""available for purchase"". There are a lot of local programming channels. The rooms have Sony Playstations that they use for DVDs as well. At check-in they give you a DVD rental card but we never used it so I have no idea how it works.The Cafe they have onsite is old and needs a good soap & water scrubbing too, BUT, the food and service was good. It's more like a diner. The concierge is not really a traditional ""concierge"" for the hotel. They are really sales people for Shell Vacation (Wyndham) timeshare. They will offer you discounts on certain excursions by getting you to go to a 2-hr timeshare presentation.

There was 6 adults and 3 kids and we never felt tight on space. Things that were ok but could use improvement:The finishes in the condo are nice but showing some wear and tear already and the condo was just renovated in 2017 I believe. I notice everything and the housekeeping company used could do a better job. I noticed certain areas that had been overlooked when it comes to cleaning. The kitchen was stocked ok for items you needed to cook yourself. The one thing it was missing was good pans. It had a few tiny pans only. We had to buy a pan set so we could cook. We left it so hopefully it’s still there for the next person. The other thing, there was a cleaning closet in the condo that was locked. I’m sure that is where there would be a broom and vaccine and cleaning products. We were there 10 nights and had to buy a cheap broom at Walmart and basic cleaning supplies. I’m sure the reason that stuff is not available is so you call and pay for the cleaning company to do a housekeeping while you are there. We did not do that. The lanai is huge but most days it was too hot to enjoy it. Some sort of shade would be nice. It was full sun all day and too hot. The floor burnt your feet. An awning or something would be perfect. But we thought the condo was probably not allowed to have anything like that up there. If you want a tan this lanai is the place to be!The Good!!!!The absolute best location in Waikiki!!!!! Stunning views of the ocean and diamond head. It’s very spacious and well payed out and nicely furnished. You are paying for the view and it is worth it! Lots of space for a large family. This condo had laundry right in the suite! This was amazing. The couch was super comfortable and room for everyone. The outdoor furniture was great. When it wasn’t too hot on the lanai it was the best place to sit and enjoy the views! This condo has the best views of the Friday night fireworks.

The room has a didvider from the living room for some privacy and two full beds which was a plus as there were four adults in our room. There is no maid service each day as I knew this when I booked and that meant washing my towels a couple of times through the week which was fine as I don't like anyone in my room each day if I am not there. My only recommendation to make the room better would be add a few more bath towels and wash cloths and also a room safe. The room also included wifi. The room has been updated from original as this hotel is fifty plus years like many other hotels in the area. We rented a car and used the valet to park with in and out services. I think like $20.00 a day a little pricey to some but in large cities it is not. I liked not searching for a spot and not having to walk to off sight parking garages as it rains off and on in Hawaii.

Built in the 60's, today it mostly comprises individually owned condos, half of which have ocean views. Because of its age, and because the condos are often vacant--especially in the fall and late spring,-- It is by far the most affordable oceanfront ""hotel"" in Honolulu. But to really get a good price, do not book through the website. Look on Craig for the advertisements of individual owners who are advertising their places, either by themselves or through agents. During fall and late spring, you should be able to get an ocean view condo for $100/night, all taxes included. Even less if you can accept a city/mountain view.Now these places will vary in terms of how well they are furnished, so ask for photos and make sure the owner commits to a specific room for which you have photos. And always pay by credit card. The hotel has excellent amenities: a nice, clean deep pool, a very good reasonably priced restaurant, etc. Location is superb. Parking may seem difficult but you can park in an indoor lot on the 3rd floor of the Discovery Bay Center which is across the street. Price is $15 for 24 hours, and you enter the lot from the street BEHIND the Center i.e. the first block east of, and parallel to, Ala Moana.When I was picked up from the airport, the Uber driver told me that he liked the Ilikai a lot, because it was the one waterfront hotel that Hawaiians can afford. After spending two weeks there, I agree with his assessment, and would certainly return there. On the other hand, if you're one of those who has no problem paying $300-400 per night, then the Ilikai is not for you. And at the other beachfront hotels, pay you will.One more point: I walked all the way down the beach, and swam in many segments. The beach nearest the lagoon--NOT Waikiki Beach--is, by my reckoning , both the best and least crowded of them all. Take a good snorkel and paddle out to the close by reef. Turtles can be occasionally seen, and if you look carefully at the north most part of the reef, right where the reef meets the rocky bottom, you'll see a moray eel in its cave.","Chicago, Illinois","Pentwater--summerjoy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",199,4.0

Upon arrival, I was charged an additional $25. per day ($50 more) for activity fees. Also, I had called to check to make sure they had a shuttle before I booked & was told “yes, it run every 15 minutes”. We went downstairs to catch the shuttle and to our surprise was greeted with “you would be better off to pay to use the trolley, cab, or Uber” because the shuttle only went to their sister hotels and only run every hour or so. It did not start my day off in the greatest mood. So, no, I wouldn’t book at this hotel again. There are mannnnny top notch luxury hotels that would have been the same price and hopefully been upfront about what they were charging and offered at their hotel.

The rental process was easy. It was dark but the sound of the ocean was relaxing. We stayed for 2 weeks. The lanai was large and had chairs and a table where we often sat watching the Hilton Luau or ate our meals there. Because of its position in the building it receives only some sun in the morning. This kept it nice for sitting on. Only recommendation I would have for the lanai is a chaise lounge chair. There were lots of good beach equipment including chairs, boogie boards, sand toys and towels. It was easy to access the ocean. The lagoon is great for kids but we preferred the ocean. The bed is very firm and comfortable and we slept well. There was lots of storage for our things. The tv was an adequate size and the cable channel selection was very good. The kitchen was well stocked with gadgets. The coffee maker broke but was quickly replaced however the 10 cup was replaced with a 5 cup maker which was ok for us but might be too small for a bigger group. The shower was a good size and nicely tiled. Would have liked to have seen a rain shower. For the age and size of the building there was always adequate hot water.

Ilikai is part hotel and part privately owned suites. We stayed in a suite on the 19th floor which had a great view of the marina. Fully appointed kitchen in the suite, although you will need to pick up the basics like salt and pepper, butter, olive oil etc early in your trip. There is a store at the hotel that sells goods at a premium and an ABC convenience store nearby as well. The hotel offers shared washing facilities on the floor for $2.50 per load (The machines take only Qtrs) which was very handy, given we had packed light. If you rent a car you can valet it at the hotel and get unlimited access to you car for around $28USD per day and there is ample parking at the Marina right behind the hotel for $1USD per hourThere is a bus stop right at the front of the hotel which we used when we didn't have the rental car to get into Waikiki and back. It is very simple and several buses go past including 8, 19 and 20. Buses are air conditioned which was great. You can buy single trip tickets or day passes both from the driver. Must have exact change though. $2.75USD adult single or $5.50USD day pass. Kids half price.We were in Suite 1908 and were very happy with the quality of the beds.

We booked directly with an owner via Homeaway (VRBO). We stayed in apartment 1016. I also considered 824 which was very similar so will comment on them both. Firstly, the property generally is quite nice. The pool is fantastic - the main pool is very deep which is very unusual in Waikiki. There is also a separate wading pool good for toddlers or adults who just want to laze rather than swim. The grounds are nice, good shops coffee shop, ok restaurant etc. The location is ok in terms of beach and lagoon access. Pretty similar to most of the Hilton Village ( other than the Rainbow Tower which is right on the beach). Our apartment at 1016 is one of the view with a solid wall between the bedroom and the living area. The views from this apartment are really amazing. At first I thought that level 10 would be too low but in fact it was perfect - I felt comfortable on the deck ( not to high) and it was great to get out of the lift early rather than having to stop at lots of stops on the way up and down. My only issue with our apartment was that it had old style air conditioning which was very loud in the living area - our kids were sleeping in the living area and it was too loud to leave on at night - therefore we woke hot most nights and had to open the doors ( which was loud also!). Our property manager was great and gave us a large fan. We considered apartment 824 which is very similar in that its renovated with a solid wall - however this apartment has a heat pump rather than old aircon - I now wish I had chosen that apartment because of the aircon. I was worried that the 8th floor might have been too low but I dont think so now. We have teenage boys that dont like sharing a sofa bed so we bought an amazing self inflating king single full height blow up bed for one of them from Walmart on the first day (US$64). This was amazing - both boys thought it was very comfortable and we didn't need to add extra air during the whole 10 days. This was excellent because it kept our accommodation costs very low - meaning the 4 of us could fit comfortably in the one bedroom apartment rather than paying almost double for a two bedroom ( we paid US$320 per night for 1016 and 824 was US$260 per night). It was great having a full kitchen with fridge freezer. This building is a very cost effective option if you want an apartment. I think we had the best value ocean view in Waikiki - but the downside is that its a bit of a walk ( or a $2 bus ride, $10 uber) into the hub of Waikiki ( restaurants and shops ), although its an easy walk to Ala Moana mall.","Auckland, New Zealand","JMW2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",15,4.0

Then they offered an ocean view. We turned it down because we didn’t think it was worth 30 bucks extra per night to have an obstructed ocean view too. We could have saved that extra money on the Mountain View as well. The hotel was clean but their was a huge hole in the carpet which I feel should’ve been replaced before renting that room to us for what we paid. The manager was nice enough to send a bottle of wine for our anniversary, but that’s all they offered and we aren’t big wine drinkers. The food at cinnamon’s was subpar. However, being next to the Hilton allowed us to have better food over there at their restaurant. The beach access was a little bit of a walk and we were unaware that we had access to a shaded outdoor pool on the second floor. We thought the fully exposed to the sun pool on the first floor was the only one. The refrigerator was not on when we arrived which meant we had to wait hours for our waters and soda to cool.

The shower and bathroom were pretty gungy. There was broccoli and rice in the dish washer and some of the glassware, crockery and cutlery were dirty. I think this is a shame as I am sure the owners would not appreciate the fact that the cleaners are not doing their job efficiently.There were plenty of kitchen utensils, crockery, cutlery, glassware but I do feel that there should be a quantity of dishwasher powder and laundry detergent as having to buy these for a short stay is most frustrating and a waste of money.The bed was very comfortable and the room was relatively quiet.The bus stop is outside the door although we did struggle to work out which buses were available for the general public to ride as many of them are private tours only.We did not use the pool as it was always very crowded. For the size of the complex we considered the pool to be much too small.We went to the free hula show and even though it rained and the show had to be cut short I consider it to be the best hula show we saw in Hawaii.

Once the premium venue in west Waikiki, this is still a nice place to stay but it has it drawbacks. The internet connection is a sad joke. Every day I spent time (often a lot of time reconnecting when the techie I had up to the room to get started in the first place assured me repeatedly that I was now set for the week. Some joke). While the rooms have a full kitchen, there is no electric jug, and the coffee supplied is weak. There is no salt and pepper and none can be supplied. The adult pool is small – adequate but not exciting. There is a bar/ restaurant, but it operates separately and the shop (a copy of an ABC store without the same charm) has a limited range of goods; no fresh meat or fish and no vegetables which makes self-catering a bit of a challenge. All that said, the rooms are spacious, and the staff are gracious, and if you get off on history, then this is the place to be. But like so much of Waikiki, the product is tired; it is catering for mass consumption, and it is certainly not cheap.","Wellington, New Zealand","JohnSB3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",463,3.0

I liked the location of the Ilikai and would possibly stay again but not on the city side and I'd do a more detailed research into the condo I rented before booking.I did NOT book thru the Ilikai directly, we booked our Condo thru Waikiki Beach Rentals over half of the Ilikai has PRIVATE Condos that are booked thru rental agencies.Firstly it was so noisy we had to pretty much yell at each other when we spoke as all you can hear is city/traffic noise, it was so bad 24hrs a day and night. there is no relief from it. No one slept for 8 nights. Also there was no block out curtain, just a flimsy sheer curtain so all the city lights came in and when the sun rose in the morning it was blinding! The whole place was lit up like a Christmas Tree. The condo has a full size fridge, microwave and oven but this one had no cooking utensils! No tongs, no spatula and no baking tray. How were we supposed to cook anything?? Also it was all digital and no instructions on how to use the oven.The TV worked but over 1/2 of the channels weren't available so looking at the guide became frustrating because everything you wanted to watch would say ""not available please contact to add channel"" There were 3 of us staying in the condo (2 double beds) but only 2 beach towels were provided even though the place sleeps 4. The beds were so old and hard they were uncomforable and falling apart the mattress protector had holes and rips in it. UGH, we just hated the place and can't say anything nice about that condo at all.The Air Conditioner was so noisy it rattled all the time, between that and the city noise my poor ears are still ringing and i've been home for 4 days!The owner of this condo is getting good money for it and should be forced to do some upgrades before renting it again. It's pretty basic to have a blockout curtain in a room these days, no one needs to be woken at 5am by blaring sunlight (the sun comes up right in front of this condo) while on vacation.","Bermagui, Australia","galaga_girl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bermagui, Australia</strong>",128,2.0

The main room had a blind not block out you could see the lights at night. The sun was so bright that even with an eye mask you where awake at 5am-6am - it is nice to sleep in on holidays.. The room was hot as well even with air con on. So we had to take it in turns to get a good night sleep .The accommodation is expensive $600 aud a night so this was disappointing.

If you want to be in central Waikiki this isn't it. ABC Superette was across the street which made buying basics easy. Also a McDonalds if you need one. We wanted a place away from the noise, so naturally facing the Marina should shelter us from the tourist buses, garbage trucks etc. For the most part, we were right, except for two things - 1. There is a lot of gathering of people on the street, chatting, and also partying on docked boats Friday night. 2. It wouldn't be so much of a problem except the window and balcony doors don't seal well, or at all. Noise comes in as if the windows were open. That noise also includes garbage trucks at 4am, and the occasional tour bus taking a shortcut. The Duck boat tour also launches nearby where they have to use full throttle to get back onto land. Very loud. Parking - Parking is really easy, within the same building. Cost is $23 a day, and you can prepay the entire stay the first time you exit the parking garage. Note that there are steps going to the elevator, at least in our experience. We didn't see a 100% ADA access to the residence part of the building. Elevators are fast, so there isn't much waiting time.Amenities - This condo has almost everything you could ever need. In the kitchen, everything plus some basics like cooking oil, salt, pepper, sugar. In the closets, baby crib, stroller, sunblock, bug repellent spray, extra towels, iron/board, you name it. Kitchen feels completely new. WIFI gets about 6mbps down and 2mbps up, like DSL speeds. Quality - If you're reading down this far, you'll be interested to know that a lot of the floor tiles are loose in the unit. I think the owner must've been scammed with a bad tile contractor, or there is an issue with the subflooring of the building. The flooring in the bathroom is really bad, with all most all of the grout missing, and the tiles clicking as you walk over them. There is a downslope towards the shower which is either bc the tile contractor didn't level out the floor first, or something is still sinking in that corner. Didn't really affect the stay, but was unsettling at times. My dad complained everyday about it. Also again, the windows and balcony door does not seal completely. Shower pressure/flow was pretty low. Meanwhile the bathroom sink didn't have any water saver devices.Furnishings - lots of furniture, very useful and placed effectively. Bed was decently comfortable, but the head board is loose and not mounted securely to anything. Long chair in living room was comfortable and where I spend most of my time. There is one small chair for the tiny balcony, which in the end we didn't use much. Conclusion - Would we stay here again to resolve our noise sensitivity - No. Do we think its a good value - definitely. I'd definitely recommend this unit for a family of 4 with a tight budget.","San Francisco, California","lawrencelane</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",27,4.0

Nice kitchen units are hard to find in this area so we were delighted to find this hotel. We were not disappointed. We rented a 2 bedroom and stayed here for a week, on the 25th floor (wall to wall windows). The room was very clean and modern with a great view of the city especially at night (there were two balconies so two different views). The kitchen was well equipped with all the appliances you'll need (except a kettle!). Cleaning staff were very friendly. Small grocery store available in the lobby as well as across the street. Be aware though that if you have a car, there is valet parking only at I believe $28/day.This hotel is at the western end of Wakiki Beach so if you're big on the evening night life and like crowds you might want to be closer to the centre. The location was good for us (very near the Alo Moana Mall) and the lagoon is just a few minutes walk. This lagoon is a great place for kids - it's like a large swimming pool! Of course the beach is next door as well. The one complaint we had was with the hotel's shuttle service. This is a free minibus that does a circle route around Wakiki. Only used this once but was not impressed. Had to wait about 45 min for pickup, seems like no set schedule, no one at the hotel could tell us much about it, driver would not win any congeniality awards. This service could use some improvement. Other that our stay at the Ilikai was wonderful. Would stay here again.

First of all, it is a 50 year old hotel. The first high-rise hotel on the beach from what I understand. It's still very clean and nice but you do expect to see Jerry Lewis or Frank Sinatra to walk around the corner. The style, floor plan and color scheme is definiely from that era. If you don't require modern styling, then you're OK. I thought it gave the place some charm.Our room was very good, spacious with good amenities. The wi-fi is EXCELLENT and TV was OK. Each room has it's own wi-fi modem! I would like a bigger screen and there are a lot of channels on the menu that you don't get (that bugs me). AC is from a window unit but it kept the place very cool with minimal noise. It did wake me up one time at night with a loud buzz but that was only once in a week's time. The beds were very comfortable with great pillows. The bathroom was small compared to other resorts but has a good shower. The kitchen was a good size but didn't have a dishwasher. That's unusual from other resorts. The location is perfect. It's close to a lot of shopping. It's a main transportation center so you can catch everything from a cab, trolley to city bus right outside. It shares a public lagoon with the Hilton and right after that is the Waikiki beach. Every Friday night there are fireworks from the Lagoon. They're actually done by the Hilton but you can easily see it from the patio of the hotel.There are two pools. One pool for swimming with plenty of chairs. The other is a shallow 4"" to 1 1/2"". They provide towels and there is an attendant at each but no lifeguard.Here's the only thing that bugged me about it. There are several areas that just need to be repainted and updated. The entryway is nice but has two large bronze dolphins in the fountain. They're pretty aged and don't spray water. The passage to the pool, and eventually the beach, is just dreary. There is no decor, it needs paint and just updating. It's just a long blank hall. It's clean and everything, it's just a dreary place compared to most places and you pass through it a lot. There are lots of door jams that are dented and need to be repainted, at least on the 3rd floor. Our balcony had rusted rails and had stains. Our door had a cut-off block of wood to attach the door lock. Compared to the hotels around it, it just needs some sprucing up and a color and amenities update overall.","Arlington, Texas","kylemactx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Texas</strong>",28,4.0

The king size bed was very confortable, but as we were 3, one person slept on the sofa bed, which badly need replacing; the springs of the mattress were sticking out everywhere.

Each time we have stayed in a hotel-run suite rather than a rental by owner or by an agency. If you arrive at Honolulu Airport, as long as you don’t have enormously large bags, you can catch a city bus that will stop almost directly in front of the hotel. The staff in the lobby are helpful and friendly. During this visit, we had a room on one of the very upper floors (the 25th floor I believe) with a view of the ocean, the Hilton Hawaiian Village property, and Waikiki in the distance. You have convenient access to Waikiki should you want it, without being in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. You also have convenient access to the Ala Moana Center, which now has a full-service supermarket, and a fun Japanese food court with dozens of food options. There is a pleasant oceanfront park that offers a nice walk with lovely views of multiple varieties. You can walk through the marina area, or you can walk down to Waikiki along a pleasant walkway with ocean views. We booked a suite that had a sleeping area, a living room area, and a full kitchen. The bathroom had a walk-in shower with adequate water pressure. There was plenty of space in the unit for two people. This included floor space. For those who might do yoga or who do stretches to deal with back issues, this is a real plus. (There is also a fitness center on the ground floor that has lots of open floor space should you prefer this as a venue for stretching and exercising.) There is a lanai that adds to the space, and on the high floors in particular you have a sense of privacy even out on the lanai. We enjoyed sitting out there with our morning coffee and our evening wine. The room was clean and well maintained. It would not surprise me if it had been renovated within the past few years. Reading some of the reviews of rentals involving owners, some of them at least sound horrible. There were many five-star aspects to the Ilikai. Convenience, location, space, etc.. There were also several things, some of which are beyond the control of the hotel, that were annoying. I would stay there again; a full kitchen is a major factor. The Ilikai may well be where you choose to stay, but let me mention a few things so that you can make an informed decision. Some of these things may not matter to you, but they could also be showstoppers for some. My wife and I like to exercise. We made use of the fitness room. Getting the fitness room door to open reliably was your first form of exercise. Some of the equipment, most notably the rowing machine, was not well maintained. The resort could do a better job. Getting someone to service the rowing machine involved a runaround, another bit of unwanted exercise. We ended up going out, buying a suitable chain oil, and oiling the chain of this machine; we own two of them and so we know a bit about Concept2 rowing machines. This helped, but the machine needed more attention than I could provide. On the theme of infrastructure failures, and things being a bit worn around the edges, the floor we were on had a sign for an ice machine, but the ice machine had been removed. The refrigerator had no icemaker, and that is fine, but then more than one ice cube tray might have been a good idea. The room had an alarm clock that was set to the wrong time, and the time on it couldn’t be adjusted. We eventually unplugged it. The rice cooker did not shut off when the rice was done, and so you had to pay more attention than you normally do when using a rice cooker. The blender would have had a hard time blending runny mashed potatoes into milk; it was anemic, and the controls had been taped into a specific position. The suite we were in did not have a dishwasher, and I suspect this is the norm. I don’t mind washing dishes, and there were plenty of pots, pans, glasses, plates, and silverware, but if you are on vacation, you might prefer to be able to put things into a dishwasher and be done with it. The hotel is smoke-free, which I appreciate because I am allergic to smoke. At night, unless smoke somehow drifted up 25 floors from the street level to the lanai, someone closer by was smoking, most likely on a nearby lanai. We couldn’t identify the source. If you closed the door and turned on the air conditioning, you would occasionally get the distinct smell of cigarette smoke, or cannabis in one instance, coming into the room, particularly late at night. Perhaps owners of units are free to smoke, and the ventilation system of the hotel provides a conduit for their smoke to enter hotel-owned rooms. We also had this issue during a prior stay. It was not a nightly thing, but during our 9-night stay we had one night of outdoor smoke, one night of indoor smoke, and one night of something with the distinct aroma of cannabis. Finally, the key reader on our door was unreliable. We would get two keys, and usually only one would work. We repeatedly had to go down and get new keys, and even if both worked on the first try, within a day one of them would fail, and on one occasion both stopped working, and we had to head back down to the lobby yet again. A maintenance person came by and “tested” the door mechanism, and said it worked just fine, except when it repeatedly didn’t. None of these things, taken individually, are a really big deal, but the collection of these “minor” things got a little old over time. If you are looking for a property/hotel that provides convenient access to Waikiki and is well served by the city bus system, but don’t want to be in the middle of the madness that Waikiki can be, the Ilikai is a very good choice, and I will most likely stay there again in the future. Our stay would have been even better had there been fewer “minor issues”. I will leave it to you to decide whether the Ilikai is a good fit for you.","Berkeley, California","Andreas G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berkeley, California</strong>",288,4.0

We cooked breakfast everyday, had nice steak and shrimp dinners while watching the fireworks in the balcony. We had a nice view of the luau next door every night.The building itself is nice.

The condo was spacious but poorly-maintained and horribly furnished/decorated. It was like staying in an elderly and eccentric great aunt's apartment. We no doubt would have had a better experience had we rented from a different owner or from the hotel itself as we noticed two rooms nearby with the same layout that looked quite modern and nice. For this reason, I bumped up what would have been a 2-star rating to a 3. The hotel itself (famous for the opening scene on the original Hawaii Five-O) is reasonably well-located - not on the main Waikiki beach but not too far of a walk away for someone in good health. In fact, it is not on a beach at all, but rather overlooks the harbor (which despite the nice sunsets is not the most picturesque since it is interrupted by parking lots). So if the beach is your goal, there are much better (albeit more expensive) places to stay. Unfortunately the pool here is small and unattractive too, so really this is mainly a place to sleep and hunker down between excursions elsewhere. The restaurant onsite is casual and nothing special, although the food was better than expected. Altogether, I cannot recommend this place although it is an OK spot for those on a budget who don't mind walking a little. I suspect there are better options nearby, including the Hilton next door and the Modern on the other side. We were here only a couple of days while on business after a more extended holiday visit to another island so it worked all right for our purposes.","East Lansing, Michigan","sparcouvol</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>East Lansing, Michigan</strong>",30,3.0

There are also numerous places to eat nearby....special mention to Goofys which is perfect for meals, all organic and local produce. The pools are lovely but we loved the beach.

We like the junior suites. They are great size with great balconies. I really like the beds and the extra pillows. They are one of the most comfiest ones ever. However this year I was turned off by the staff. The bell service was so aggressive asking for tips. We wanted them to hold our luggage for about 4 hours. We had to ring the front dest, for front desk to call out the bell service to their own desk that they were not attending, which was about a 5 minute wait. We actually wheeled the luggage right next to the room where they store it, and the guy literarily wrote a ticket in 30 seconds and almost didn't even have to touch the luggage, and then proceeded to indirectly ask for tips for a good 3-4 minutes. ""Are you sure you can't do anything for me, since you wont see me again as my shift ends before you'll pick your luggage"", ""So your luggage will be here when you come back, is there anything else to do here, this is the last time you will see me before you pick up the luggage"" and 15 more sentences like this, was completely unnecessary. If the staff is so hungry for tips, the management should address this issue, and perhaps put a tip jar on the bell service desk.Second time was going from Ilikai to the modern, we went through Cinnamon's where we ate several times and spent decent dollar there with( 20% tips). Anyway, so I made it through Cinnamons just fine, but the manager/host started yelling at us mid walk and my partner stopped to see what he wants. He held my partner up for like 4 minutes telling him this is not a public walkway and he cannot cross through the restaurant. Anyway, after 4 minutes of listening to his aggressive speech my partner just continued to walk and finally made it to the other side. I think this is completely unnecessary for the staff to do this. We are the hotel guests, walking through the hotel restaurant, there should have been no yelling and shouting in my opinion.","Chicago, Illinois","Aiste B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",12,4.0

We lived in the sunset ocean view room on floor 24. The room had a fully equipped kitchen which was awesome to cook breakfast, lunch and have coffee in the morning. Cleaning service was everyday with fresh towels. The view was out of this world. Spend the extra cash and book it. Every evening we got a beautiful sunset to accompany our beers on the patio. The hotel was a great location. 10 min walk to the Ala Moana centre, 10 min to the lagoon, 15 min to the beach. However parking is waaayy to expensive. Park at the Red Lobster for $20/day which was less than a block away. Also, we looked around for car rental prices and we found the cheapest was the Alamo in the discovery bay centre across the street. Cinnamons in the hotel was great, especially Wednesdays and Fridays when drinks and appies are 50% off 3pm-6pm. Hotel doesn't tell you, you have to ask, but they have beach chairs at the front desk that you can borrow. They are light enough to carry to the beach. The pool was ok, 50 person limit, and more often than not it was booked. There is a small wading pool with lounge chairs on the second floor that's perfect for sunbathing. It's rarely busy. There are fireworks on Fridays that the Hilton puts on at 7:45pm. If you walk down to the lagoon and sit on the beach or grass you get a perfect view.Last tip, the elevators are ALWAYS busy.

I did like that the Ilikai however is in an area that is not as busy and is closer to the Alo Moana shopping center. It’s just a 10 min easy walk away. This time we opted for the Hilton lagoon side thinking it would be quieter. And I’ll admit it is much quieter than our pre cruise hotel but still rather loud. It’s currently Sunday 11pm and the hotels around have live music which you can hear as clear as day inside the room.We have kids so the noise is a disturbance. We can hear it through earplugs. We have booked room 1942 so I thought we’d be high enough for some peace and quiet. I think I’m starting to realize that no hotel in Waikiki will give you peace and quiet. Therefore any future holidays in Hawaii will be on other islands. On the positive the location of the Ilikai is great. There’s and abc store on the corner.

We had an ""ocean view"" - but I saw no advantage to being on the 22nd floor (although going ""down"" there is the advantage that the elevator is not full.

The lagoon is perfect for families with small children (there is shade from trees, grassy areas, rental items and the water is shallow, clean and warm). We were able to walk from the hotel along the beach as far as we wanted. The ""store"" in the hotel itself is very handy and the prices were amazingly reasonable. There was also a coffee house, a restaurant/bar and gift shop on site. There is also car rental on site - much more reasonable than at the airport.

The full size fridge was very handy though especially for a family of four.There is a resort fee of $20 USD per day which covers things like beach towels, beach chairs, daily newspaper, playstation game hire, in room wifi (each room has their own modem so the speed is very good), shuttle bus etc. I found it to be good value for money.We only had one issue with housekeeping whereby they kept on short changing us on towels, there were four people staying in our room and out of our 11 night stay we received 3 towels on 8 of those nights. There was also one day where our room did not get made up at all, to the hotels credit when I called down they sent housekeeping up do our room with dry towels. Hotel management also very kindly reduced our resort fee payment by 5 days to compensate for the inconvenience.We hired a car and used the valet parking at the hotel, you cannot self park, it is $30 per 24 hour period.All in all we had a wonderful time at the Ilikai, we stayed for 11 nights so the bigger space in the room was perfect and I would highly recommend this property to anyone who is staying longer than 5 nights.",Sydney,"Lynsey G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",10,4.0

That said, it is super well situated near the Waikiki beach and Lagoon and the Hilton mega complex of towers. We rented four individual suites on different floors for a party of ten travelling on a family vacation. The suites all had great full functional kitchens with microwaves, stoves, fridges, toasters, blenders etc. The suites are divided into two separate rooms - allowing 3-4 people to sleep in each. Yes the furnishings are dated, the hallways and elevators are as well - so is the lobby. But for a fairly good price (approx $300US/night) you are able to get a functioning suite (and likely a pretty great balcony view) in a prime piece of property. Sunsets are also amazing. Some highlights: very well situated along Ala Moana - 5 minute walk to huge upscale and beautiful Ala Moana Mall as well as tons of conveniences from the perennial ABC stores seemingly on every block...to McDonald’s, car rentals, restaurants etc. At the Ilikai itself, there is a great coffee store in the lobby, Aroma, with good coffee, Açai bowls, paninis and they sell coffee. The minimart store in the lobby is also very well stocked with alcohol, fruit, souvenirs, newspapers from the mainland like the NYTimes! as well as ice cream, junk food, towels, bags, bread and tons of other stuff. Hawaii serves alcohol in stores until about 11:45am. This store closes at 11pm. Lowlights: main pool is way too small and bathrooms were broken which limited capacity to 50 so it was never available unless you got there prior to 9am. Beach is close by. Kiddie pool is fully open and if you don’t mind kids, it can work just as well. The concierge desk wasn’t always manned - including during prime hours. Or manned by one concierge = lengthy lineups. The hotel is very busy so there can be lengthy wait times for the elevators as endless tourists arrive and leave! Be warned!

We were supposed to stay until January 4th but we checked out early. I was very disappointed with the hotel amenities. First, when we arrived it was just like we had been there the entire time, no fanfare. It was my first visit to Hawaii and I was expecting to be greeted with a drink and a Lei. But no problem, I guess I shouldn't have assumed that would happen. To be honest the room was not bad, it had a kitchen and we could make out own breakfast and coffee. That was one of the best parts, along with the location. The Hilton had a fireworks show and from my room I could see everything. The problem was with the gym and the pool for me. The pool had an early closing time and a 50 people limit. There was only one pool and it was extremely small. On one particular day we took our daughter to the pool after she kept asking to go. It closed at 7 or 7:30 which seemed early considering I saw folks in other pools well after 8. So we go down at about 5:45 or so. The doors are locked but people are inside. So we peek in and there aren't 50 people so what is going on? Billie, the pool attendant decided that she was going to close the pool early and start cleaning up. She refused to open the door and let us in. We spoke to the front desk only to find out that they don’t manage the pool. It was over the holiday and the manager of the pool or the hotel wasn’t there. My daughter was upset for the entire night. We were so disappointed with how the hotel handled it we began looking for another hotel that night. If this is a part of your facility you need to manage it or set a policy on how it will be managed. Bottom line: The pool area sucks. The gym was another disappointment. The room is huge however there is only one treadmill (the other one broke on day 2), one elliptical, one bike and one rowing machine. All the equipment in there is old, like atleast something that was popular in the 80’s maybe even late 70’s. The machines weren’t paired properly at all and no free weights. You couldn’t successfully work any muscle group because there was only one machine for any given group. They did have a few floor mats so multiple people could get an ab workout. The room was so big several more machines could fit but, I guess the hotel didn’t manage that either. For the price the amenities should have been far better.",,Stephanie J,5,3.0

I believe the Ilikai Hotel & Luxury Suites manage the levels 23 and up, and the lower levels are separately managed with a mixture of self-managed rentals, residents and the older-styled rooms. The room we stayed in was spacious enough to accommodate us comfortably during our stay. It has an open configuration with contemporary furnishing and a balcony that faces the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the lagoon. The kitchen is modern and spec'ed out with a ceramic cooktop, oven, microwave oven, toaster and a full-sized fridge. It is also well stocked with cookware and utensils as well as dinnerware. Our room had a king-size bed and a sofa bed that we did not use. Our kids were not interested in PS3 console games, but I would imagine this would be an excellent feature to have for some families. You can rent free PS3 games and DVDs at the self-serve kiosk near the lobby. The hotel is located roughly 10-minutes’ easy-paced walk to Ala Moana shopping centre and about 20-minutes to the centre of Waikiki beach. There are two ABC stores (convenience store) within a couple of minutes’ walk that you can stock up on your basic supplies like water, milk, bread etc. There aren’t a wide selection of restaurants/take-outs to choose from nearby as this is the quieter end of Waikiki. We found ourselves opting for Uber Eats delivery most of the time for convenience. We managed to save a few bucks by heating up the leftovers on a few occasions too. The main pool in the hotel was being renovated, but this was no big deal as the Hilton Lagoon (a.k.a. Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon) which is open to the public is only minutes’ walk away. There is a ramp from the hotel that links up with the pathway to the lagoon. We had a great view of the fireworks This is my fourth holiday in Hawaii and my first staying at the Ilikai. I have always stayed in the heart of Waikiki, but I am glad we chose here this time around – much quieter and less busy + a kitchen! Planning on coming back next year. Note to the management:We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ilikai - a quick feedback on some minor things: Couple of requests to the front desk were unactioned and had to be requested again.Our room had a block-out curtain, but no light-filtering curtain – we noticed other rooms did.

This place is approx. 60 years old and the lobby, outdoor courtyard area are beautifully maintained. The hallways and elevators are not air conditioned but that was not an issue with our December stay. The units vary greatly. Some are controlled by Ilikai Hotel with daily maid service and mandatory daily resort fees. Most are privately owned and made available either through VRBO, homeaway or property management companies like Waikiki Beach Rentals, aloha condos.com. or timeshare sharks Shell Vacations Club. Big variation in prices. Ilikai Hotel units are generally standard but most owner units depend on the owners decorating tastes and how long ago any renovations were effected. The condo association requires a certain amount of upgrading and the units with the blue sofas have minimal updates where the owner chose not to be involved. BE AWARE - property management companies like Waikiki Beach Rentals will ONLY POST POSITIVE REVIEWS on their website with very few indicators of dates when these reviews were posted and always lead you to believe that the unit has been RECENTLY renovated even though it may have been 10 years ago. All their photos reflect what the unit looked like after the LAST reno.If you are careful who you reserve with and are selective of your unit, you will love staying at the Ilikai. P.S. Hawaii Five O films regularly at the lagoon near Ilikai. They pay Gilligan's Shrimp Truck to move his truck for the morning or day to make room for Kamekona's shrimp truck (which is just a prop) or the film crew vehicles to occupy that parking area.

Just a 5 minute walk down the boardwalk puts you at the big lagoon where you can rent canoes and water-trikes or just swim around. Another 5 minutes down and you're at pretty much the same beach that visitors of the Hilton enjoy. Our hotel room door had mechanical issues that would not let us lock it, but that was solved within an hour of us reporting the problem. The crib that was provided for our son was comfy and safe and he had no trouble sleeping while we were there. If you drive a rental car to stay there, beware of the *very* steep daily valet charge which you have no choice but to pay unless you want to try your luck finding street parking in the heart of waikiki.. The location and base price may be great, but prepared to be gouged by some of the most numerous additional fees I've ever seen in my life. I kid you folks not - there was a ""hotel services"" fee that was like $18 bucks a night or something like that. I politely tried to ask the front desk while we were checking in - isn't the $140 dollars we are paying you ever day for the very thing one would call ""hotel services?"" Like, if we didn't pay, what would we not be able to make sue of in the hotel. I was met with a kurt non answer after the staff member behind the desk pondered this for a moment: ""Sir, this is a fee for the services of the hotel."" Having acquired the knowledge that I wasn't exactly dealing with the head of client satisfaction, I just left it at that. There might as well have been a ""fee processing fee"" - I don't remember all the exact additional charges, but that was basically what it felt like. In the end, a 5-day stay there resulted in us having to shell out about an extra $300 just to enjoy the hotel I thought I had already paid to stay at. If they would just up their nightly rate a bit and do away with the surprise ""now that you're here you're kinda screwed, what are you gonna do turn around and fly home?"" fees, I would have more respect for how this is run. But it feels a bit like bait and switch to have such a low nightly rate advertised only to end up paying an end total sum of money that would have allowed you to stay in a classier joint like the Hilton next door.","Sunnyvale, California, United States","Josh G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunnyvale, California, United States</strong>",9,3.0

The package was quite affordable and the suite we got was so beautiful! The room was basically a room with a small living room, a full kitchen (including pots and pans) a fridge and stove. Great for people who are looking to save and want to stay in a few nights and cook together. The hotel manager sent us a bottle of champagne which was such a kind and surprising touch. The cleaning staff was on point and our room always looked very clean the full week we were there. The only thing that threw me off was the lack of room service (we tend to like to dine in and we're too lazy to cook one night, but we're surprised to find out that there was no room service) The other thing that was a problem was the staff at the concierge desk. We wanted to book various activities and the lady that attended us made us feel like fools for wanting to do certain things like visiting the Polynesian welcome center. She was quite unprofessional in her interaction with us and tried to con us into booking a timeshare presentation, by masking it as a complimentary breakfast. she said she already booked it for us and kept talking about the activities we wanted to do. When I asked her to clarify she said it was a breakfast that would get us discounted prices to the activities we wanted to do. I then asked her to tell us what the point of this was and she then disclosed it was a timeshare presentation (because she wanted to be honest). Needless to say, we ended up only booking one activity with her as a result of her attitude and ended up paying full price for the activity. This was the only bump during our stay but it was very troubling for us. ","Alhambra, California","gloriag193</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alhambra, California</strong>",3,4.0

The Hotel itself is well appointed with good facilities, The new pool on the second floor is a delight for adults who want some peace and quiet the main pool is good if small but if you need shade then it's not ideal. The lobby shops are the normal mix you find in any Waikiki Hotel and the little general store is perfect and carries all the essentials, the staff were lovely and could not do enough to assist, it also has a very useful ATM machine. There is a great coffee shop just off the lobby and also a restaurant with entertainment. There are a good selection of restaurants within minutes and the bus stop right outside gives you access to wherever you wish to go. The heart of Waikiki is a short walk one way and Ala Moana Shopping Centre is 5 minutes in the other. Although not directly on the beach it's literally a 3 minute walk away and he you want a really family friendly safe beach then Ala Moana Beach Park is again a ten minute stroll. I booked direct with Marina Hawaii Vacations who have an office on site, all done through email and as simple as can be and I would certainly book with them again.

You are also right next door to where the Friday fireworks are held which is very convenient.Unfortunately, there were some major problems with the hotel, which detracted form the positives. The main pool was closed for renovations, which only left a tiny wading pool for the entire 25 floors worth of rooms which was very disappointing. The primary restaurant, which was one of the reasons we had booked this hotel months ago, had closed, and there was no alternative in the hotel, so we had to go elsewhere for a nice dinner. This was extremely disappointing to us. The bed was rock hard (some people might like the firmness), so it threw my back out for the first night and I was in a lot of pain the next 2 days.

There was a double bed and a foldout lounge for the kids to share plus another fold out bed in the wardrobe. We were on the 16th floor.The full kitchen was great as it meant we could eat breakfast at home every day and sometimes dinner if we didn’t feel like going out. There was also a vacuum cleaner in the cupboard which was great for cleaning up the sand each night.A full bathroom with shower and toilet.When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly lady who got us all checked in and straight up into our room. There was parking next door for $20 per day or valet for $28 which is what we used.The room itself was clean and updated, it wasn’t spectacular but hey all we planned to do was sleep in there each night! The only negatives I have with the room were the blinds were broken so as soon as the sun was up it was blinding you and we couldn’t really ever have a sleep in and we booked for 5 people but we’re only given 4 towels and had to pay if we wanted more (strange)There are 2 pools which we never used and a little shop down stairs that sold all the necessities at a decent price. Each floor also has a laundry room and the prices were ok.There was also a restaurant downstairs and 3 nights of the weeks they have something on, nothing big but nice enough to just chill downstairs and listen to live music.The view was spectacular, overlooking the lagoon and the tail end of Waikiki beach.We were within walking distance to the lagoon (literally at the bottom of the hotel) and Waikiki beach and the marina. You aren’t right in the heart of Waikiki which was good and bad for us. Negative: sometimes you want the hustle and bustle and a few more dining and shopping options. Positive: you were away from the hustle and bustle! In saying that though there were plenty of places to eat (Red Lobster next door and Wild Wings across the road) and a few shops to browse in.

Have been there 30+ times. 90% of the time we stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki, a couple of times at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and always enjoyed our stay. Lots of changes at the Sheraton, many good ones, yet, it has lost the ""old"" Hawaii spirit/feel which makes Hawaii one of the most wonderful places on earth. It has a 'rushed' feeling to it. This post is not to dig on other properties, it is simply my observation and knowledge from seeing these hotels for years. I do enjoy walking around the shops in the 'village' like atmosphere at Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV), but as far as staying there it is like ""Disney World."" It has just expanded too much to want to stay there and the pool lounging area is anything but relaxing.Sheraton is very pretty and we like the pool but it is very crowded and the lobby area is a busy pass through lobby versus one that captures the relaxation of enjoying the ambience.This past trip, my husband, 2 adult children and 6 year old grandson went for 10 days. My initial concern with the Ilikai was not having the children's pool like they do have at the Sheraton and HHV. But we decided to give it a try. And it worked out much better than I thought and there was absolutely no disappointment for the 6 year old. He would play in the pool at times but what he loved was the large lagoon in front of the hotel which I believe is associated with the HHV (maybe), yet we had complete access to. We got him a few floats and balls at the ABC store and we would set up under the tree around the lagoon and he had a blast the entire time. It was so much more relaxing and fun for all. For my husband and I to get away and really relax, we went to the 2nd floor new adult pool at the Illikai... amazing and absolutely wonderful.And at night or late in the afternoon, we loved sitting in the lobby or in the outside area that looks over the marina. Just so peaceful and ""Hawaiian."" The entertainment at night (unsure if every night) was excellent and you can also have a front seat view of the fireworks show they do on Friday nights at the HHV.We stayed in one of the upper floors (new rooms) and they were lovely with a full kitchen, nice bathroom, and well decorated. I cannot comment on the decor of the other floors as I ""think"" some are individually owned.The main pool worked well but needed updating. I have heard they are currently in the process of renovating that pool which on our next trip I look forward to seeing. We enjoyed the convenience of walking next door to the HHV if I just wanted to walk around the shops. Also, it was a very easy walk to the Ala Moana Mall which is a fabulous mall.What I would like to see added is drink/food service to the pool. That would be nice. Other than that it is a hidden gem!","Anderson, South Carolina, United States","Annie8991</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anderson, South Carolina, United States</strong>",11,5.0

The property is quite old and in need of a refurbishment although our studio room with kitchen was fine and served its purpose. However the main hotel pool was closed leaving only a children's pool as an option which was disappointing to say the least. When my wife mentioned this to a member of the reception desk staff he suggested that she could 'always swim in the sea ' !! Not a helpful comment although in fairness they did reduce our resort fee. The main Italian themed restaurant was also closed leaving Cinnamons bar/bistro as the only option which quite frankly was poor at best. It was not part of the hotel but operated by another company who clearly should invest more in staff training as the bar service left a lot to be desired.

The rooms are a fair size, nicely decorated with good kitchens and bathrooms (no bath). It could do with more mirrors in the room as there is only one in the bathroom. Choose ocean side rooms on higher floors for great views. Expect to walk 15-20 mins to the main part of Waikiki for shopping and dining.Issues with the hotel worth noting are the location of the designated smoking area right at the top of the only walkway to the lagoon and beach. Everyone has to walk through the constant plumes of smoke going in and out of the beach side of the hotel which is really frustrating.The 24/7 Fitness Centre consists of some fairly ancient and poorly maintained equipment (no free weights). For a hotel of its size, this really needs maintenance and upgrading. We ultimately had to pay a small fortune to use a local gym.The downstairs pool is really deep and not very kid friendly. It's also quite small and dated in design.Daily room servicing consists of bed making and towel and toiletries replacement. No other cleaning appears to take place. This is especially annoying with regard to dishes which do not get cleaned and there is no dishwasher. A clothing item of ours went missing during a room service. We have emailed to find out if it got caught up in sheets or towels with no response - very disappointing given the cost of the top and negligence in the process.In room wifi is great but there is no wifi anywhere else! Unlike many other cities in the US we visited, it was a real struggle to get wifi access pretty much anywhere other than our hotel room.Much like most of Hawaii, the Ilikai is a bit dated and the staff are not overly friendly.

We selected the hotel for a few days rest after a fairly hectic world tour and to break journey from NY to Australia. It is well located in Waikiki and a large lagoon opposite the beach is only a short stroll away. It had its own 20 metre pool and but not incorporated well into the layout, maybe an after thought but good for laps in the morning and very comfortable temperature. Check in was very efficient and friendly and all luggage delivery to room shortly after our arrival. We had a lovely spacious room with full kitchen and good sized bathroom and a large balcony overlooking the sea and marina. The kitchen was well stocked with utensils etc but we had to request an electric jug which was most odd. Clearly Americans don't start the day with two cups of English Breakfast tea. Watch out for the ratty pigeons that quite happily trot into you room and say hello if you leave the balcony door open. Best not to encourage them. The room is well air-conditioned and if you leave balcony door open at night with no aircon you will not be bothered by any Mosquitos etc. They resort is well located with restaurants and shops nearby but it also has its own mini-supermarket which is fully stocked with everything you need including in-expensive alcohol. Plus if looking for a light meal it has fresh salads, fruit trays etc if you need a break from restaurants. It also has a nice outdoor Cininmon Cafe for breakfast and casual meals plus bar and dinner menu. There is also a little cafe near the restaurant which provided the best coffee we'd had in a long time. There is also an up-market restaurant on the 30th floor which was very nice and had terrific views over the water. The hotel also had a Hertz office in the foyer which was handy.

Highly recommend choosing lagoon facing rooms and ideally towards the right wing if facing the sea. The view is great and you can also catch the fireworks from the room's balcony.The room is quite spacious and comes with a well equipped kitchen. No kettle though. The room was very clean and modern with good wifi. I think each room has its own router which helps.The hallways weren't quite as nice and a bit dated but I'm sure that's not much of a concern for most people.We saw three swimming pools but ended up using the shallow pool on level two everyday as it's most suitable for young kids. Best to use the pool mid to late afternoon when the building's shadow will shelter you from the sun.There is a fancy restaurant on the very top floor which we enjoyed. A bit pricey but food and service was goood. Also had live music which was a real plus. Lobby area is reasonably large with some shops including a convenience store. Quite handy for purchasing water and some food in the mornings. Location wise it's not bad but requires some walking. Took us about 15min on foot to Ala Moana and likewise to the centre of Waikiki. Alternatively, the trolley bus does stop outside or you can take a complimentary shuttle but the timetable is not very frequent.Overall, a family friendly hotel like most in Hawaii.

So when I started planning this trip a year ago, I knew this would be the perfect hotel to stay as I celebrated my Hawaii 5-0 birthday! What I didn't know before coming is that the marina here at the hotel is also where the beginning of Gillian's Island was filmed. You know when they board the S.S. Minnow. Plus the rooms have full kitchens which saved us on eating out. Our room, 2232 was great and it was an ocean view room, which I knew I wanted from the beginning. And the fact that you could rent DVD's to watch in your room, free of charge. The staff was very pleasant, especially Rod (who checked us in), and Sherry (security guard we saw everyday we were there; 7 days). The General Manager, Wes Kawakami sent a card with a hand written note welcoming us and wishing me a happy birthday, along a box of cookies from Honolulu Cookie Company and a bottle of Champagne.

We were greeted at reception by Richelle who was very friendly & helpful. Our room was 2439 a sunset ocean view room & the view was amazing! We previously had stayed the Hilton Hawaiian Village but this was so much better. The rooms are very spacious & the kitchens are great basically it's a full kitchen with plenty of room ( I wish my kitchen was as nice at home). The bathrooms are nice & big & there is plenty of bench space. There was always plenty of hot water not like previous reviews I had read. The baloney was nice & big & it was nice to sit out there at sunset & after dark looking at the views. The staff were always very helpful, we had order a cot & it was delivered to our room fast. There was a older maid I met on the 1st day can't remember her name but I know her daughter is having a baby in November but she was absolutely lovely. She was not our usual maid but this lady was always really nice & talked with our 8 mths old daughter. The lifts were never too busy & we never had to wait too long. I'm not sure what the pools are like cause we always went to the beach out the back of the Hilton near the lagoon.

The hotel was chosen because it was close to cousins we were visiting. There are definitely others hotels to stay in that provide better customer service during and after your stay. We booked a partial ocean view. When we arrived, the only room available was on the 2nd floor and its only view was a marina and boats, no ""ocean"". I opted to spend $40 per night for a full ""ocean"" view (room 2524) and as you'll see from the photo I attached, this was no ""full"" view. Unfortunately, I was told it was the only other room available in the hotel. (I phoned two times to see if anything else was available and was told no). Housekeeping - Not once during our stay was the room vacuumed, nor was the patio ever cleaned or dishes/cutler put away. This is in spite of me leaving a $4/$5 tip daily. Ice - on the Fourth of July we had guests over and were unable to find ice anywhere in the hotel; not even in their store. When I phoned the front desk to ask why no ice was available, I was told to walk to a store and get some. Ants - When we checked into the room, there was slip of paper informing us that pest control services would occur during our stay. That was a good thing. I wish it had occurred earlier during the stay because we ended up with an ant problem in our bathroom, on the patio, and in our luggage. There was also a problem with our sink backing up and after it was treated, the problem stopped, so I think that may have been due to the pest problem. Positives - the suite itself was beautiful, the onsite restaurant, Cinnamon's, is delicious, the hotel sundry store has an excellent selection and wonderful staff, and the bands that played were very good. After I returned home, I wrote directly to the hotel manager, Sandra Hashimoto, and never received the courtesy of a response. It has been two months. I also wrote to Costco Travel and never received the courtesy of a response. Neither will get my business in the future. As I said there are many other hotels to choose from and I would suggest staying elsewhere and using other travel services.","Mentone, California","traeceya</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mentone, California</strong>",16,3.0

One thing I can say about almost all of the Waikiki hotels is that they are not that great inside unless they are brand new or have been completely gutted and remodeled. So to pay a premium just for a ""brand name"" hotel is not worth it for me as I spend most of my time outside. Also, I wanted a kitchen and most hotels do not have kitchens unless you stay at an outdated one.Note: this review is for the hotel room not a condo or time share. I knew that I didn't want a mountain view room as those rooms face the noisy Ala Moana Blvd. So I paid a little more for a pool view room since the pools face the ocean, but there was no view of the pool, LOL! The staff was nice and we arrived early and our room was ready. The room had been remodeled recently so it was nice inside. These rooms come with only 1 bed and a pull out couch, but the bed was very comfortable. Kitchen was nice and they provided dish soap and paper towels, but everything else you have to buy. Who really wants to buy salt, pepper,spices when you're only there a week? I did use the activities desk to book 1 adventure and a rental car. FYI, it's so much cheaper to rent a car thru this hotel than from the actual rental place. I had looked at costs online the day before our trip and when the hotel gave me their price for the exact car I was shocked. The car rental place is just across the street so it's very convenient. If you have to park a car at this hotel you will be charged a $28/day valet fee. I like that beach towels and chairs are provided (included in daily fee you pay). While the rooms have AC, the hallways and elevator do not and the elevators are really slow and small.We ate dinner one night at Cinnamon's restaurant, not very good. But I hear their breakfast is better. I prefer to go eat near the Waikiki beachwalk as there are a lot of good restaurant options there.My only complaint about our stay was the beach and the lagoon at the Hilton Hawaii Village. The lagoon being man made had very hard ""sand"" and is not comfortable to sit on. The beach in front of the Hilton had too much coral and rocks both on the sand and in the water. We ended up walking about 8-10 minutes down the shore for better sand/water. Overall, for the price I would stay here again if I needed a kitchen. It's very convenient to the airport and is very close to the beach. There are 2 pools but we never used them as we were always at the beach. And there are 2 ABC stores on either side of the hotel.","San Francisco, California","daggiegirl04</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",14,3.0

The staff was a bit hit or miss, with some nice/helpful people, while others were not helpful and almost hostile.

We found the stay was pretty good. The staff was friendly, and accommodating; all tried to meet our needs.The hotel was part of a much larger complex. It occupies the top 5 floors of a big building. Below at the lower floors include normal residents in s number of floors, a time-share units in some floors, and maybe something else. It seems the building was originally constructed for condominiums, and subsequently partitioned into these setups.The hotel part consists of all suites, from Jr suite to 2 bedroom suites. (Not sure if there are any larger suites.) Its furnishings is good but not luxurious, with some pieces too old to be used for a 4 star hotel. Also, some suites lack certain necessary pieces. (For example, some suites do not have writing desks and chairs. No hotel rooms should be like this.) We learned later that it happens this way because the suites owners are individuals who would place whatever furnishing to their liking. The hotel management only manages the rental and caring of the property, like a hotel. We think the management should have a requirement of certain kind of furnishing uniformity before they could join the hotel.However, the hotel management tried to find ways to satisfy the customers' needs. This makes it work for those units that are deficient in their furnishings, as guests can request the hotel to bring to the suites what they need.The suites are quite spacious. All have a fully functional kitchen and adequate utensils and dishes. The TV's were good size. It includes internet in its fees. The location is good, at the end of Waikiki Beach. Its swimming pool is marginal, not quite fitting for a 4 star hotel. However, the hotel is next to Hilton Hawaiian Village which has a big lagoon and ocean beach. Hotel guests only have to walk a short distance to get to them,Overall, the hotel has good value for what it provides. But not quite luxurious as the name implies, unless some significant improvements are made. The best part of our experience is its friendly staff.

But after I kept reading not so great reviews, I booked the Ilikai. And I'm so happy I did. We stayed here for 5 nights the first week of August 2017. We had room 2342. Amazing views!! We could see the ocean, the lagoon, pools below us, the fireworks, and the nightly HHV luau show. The room was well laid out and cozy. We even had a rollaway bed brought up and still had enough room to walk around comfortably. And there's a full kitchen. The walk to the beach and lagoon is about 5 minutes via a boardwalk. Nice and easy access to Waikiki beach and Duke's lagoon from the hotel. I liked the open and airy lobby. We used the valet and never waited too long or had any issues. We were also able to walk a lot of Waikiki beach and then into the city area.It was nice to return to the quiet hotel. The Ilikai front desk was never busy and they were always helpful with fresh towels and beach chairs. We also used their DVD and game rental kiosk every night. The room was clean and looked renovated. Housekeeping was awesome. We tried to leave tip money and a thank you note a few times but they never took it. I wonder if it's hotel policy to not accept it. We only had one noise complaint from the room above us. I swear it sounded like they were stomping and pounding wood. After the second night of this happening around 11pm, I called the front desk. They took care of it because we never heard a sound again. It was quiet and peaceful. Beds are hard. I requested a pillow top and it helped a bit. I think I just got used to it and jet lag set in because I slept well every night. They also sent up a bottle of wine and glasses because they heard we were celebrating a birthday and anniversary when we checked in. Love those special touches. After visiting the main drag of Waikiki hotels I was grateful for choosing to stay at the other end of the beach where it was less congested and quieter. We didn't use the pools, we were too busy visiting the island and beaches. Elevators were sometimes crowded but that was the only time we really interacted with other guests. And there's no ac in there so it wasn't a treat when they piled in sometimes. That's really my only complaint. We also tried Cinnamons for breakfast and it was tasty. There's a little market and gift shop in the lobby area if you need anything. We were sad to leave and would definitely stay here again.

I did see photos of some rooms having sliding doors to separate the living and sleeping areas, my room did not have those sliding doors. The Aston hotel offers condos as hotel rooms with daily maid service, but I chose instead to rent through Waikiki Beach Rentals so I could select the specific condo room number with the exact view and on the floor I wanted. Renting a condo didn't give me daily maid service however, and the furnishings were older but comfortable. The property is kept up nicely, and the huge outdoor patio offers plenty of seating areas and live music with hula dancers Friday nights. Plus some seating indoors in the lobby if it's raining. It is a short walk to the Hilton Beach and just a little longer walk to the Ala Moana Beach Park and Ala Moana Shopping Center. You can catch a shuttle bus out front as well as the public bus, and taxis are available too. At least 10 restaurants within short walking distance. Great restaurant, Cinnamon's (coffee shop style with indoor A/C or outdoor patio seating) in lobby. My only suggestion for improvement would be for the management to keep the swimming pools open longer hours because they're not very big and it would be nice to swim or lounge during less busy times. Be specific in your selection of which room you prefer, as the views vary from Yacht Harbor, to Lagoon, to City depending on the wing of the building your room is located. I personally believe the Yacht Harbor view is stunning.","San Diego, California","2017JB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",14,5.0

Love that the rooms are big, have a mostly full kitchen (no dishwasher), and a good-size balcony. We ate breakfast and snacks out on the balcony every day and it was ... superb. We also loved that the Ilikai is a *very* easy walk to the Foodland Farms grocery store, the Ala Moana shopping center, and the rest of Waikiki. It was not too bad a walk to Walmart, either. We never needed transportation in Waikiki, other than our feet. But if we wanted to ride, lots of trolleys / buses have stops literally in front of the Ilikai, so super easy.We rented #1916 through vrbo.com / homeaway.com, and we had a great time. It appears rooms ending in even numbers -12 through -44 have a view of the (quiet) Ilikai pools, the less quiet Hilton kid pools (but it was not bad, not at all -- actually sweet to see all those little kids having the time of their lives), the gorgeous Duke Lagoon, the Hilton's Friday night fireworks (a serious boondoggle!), the Hilton's rooftop luau (watching the firedancers was fun), and a peekabo view of Diamond Head.The Ilikai driveway entrance is always busy but never felt congested or aggressive, with stairs, an escalator, and a small elevator around the corner for wheelchairs (my kiddo), luggage, and strollers.The entrance lobby is beautiful, open-air with monkey pod trees. I didn't really ever come up with the time to go and sit in that tranquil lobby but I admired the folks who did, very quiet and peaceful with a nice breeze. We did not interact with the front desk staff so I can't say anything about them. Four times we did go to the concierge; the first time the lovely young brunette with thin tortoiseshell frames was friendly and helpful, but the other tree times the women working there were more (less?) than apathetic, bored, absolutely disinterested in offering us (or the other visitors we saw) help. So we just looked things up ourselves and went from there. Very easy!The security staff, the maintenance workers, and the staff manning the pools were **fabulous**. I mean seriously -- we liked them. The lovely lady at the family swimming pool was so sweet offering to help me get my disabled child in the wheelchair lift (LOVE that the Ilikai has one!). The other pool has a built-in ramp and a suntanning deck (not sure what to call it -- very shallow water) which was terrific for us as well. The bathrooms at the family pool were also good and totally disabled-friendly. Thank you!!!The lagoon is very easy to access from the Ilikai with a long, smooth ramp just past the family pool -- loved that ramp. Because of it we were able to swim / do watersports there easily, as well as walk along the terrific beach boardwalk.At certain times of day the elevators can be very, very crowded and necessitate quite a wait: be prepared. We appreciated the bathers' elevator and routinely availed ourselves of it. I also appreciated the washers / dryers on the room floors -- it was USD$2.50 per wash, USD$2.50 per dry. Expensive but so, so convenient.If I were to return to Waikiki I wouldn't think twice about staying here again, and have already freely and repeatedly recommended to others staying at the Ilikai when in Waikiki. We loved having a kitchen (for breakfast and snacks), we loved the incredible walkability / location.","Superior, CO","June_Boys</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Superior, CO</strong>",117,4.0

As our flight was cancelled we needed to vacate the Hilton and chose the Ilikai as it was next door. It was a great choice and unlike the Hilton it was lovely and quiet with excellent service.

This is my second visit to the Ilikai, my wife and I fell in love with this place the first time we came here, nice comfortable room with kitchen and best of all ocean front view and Hilton's firework on a Friday night from the balcony. This time we were not as fortunate ,when we checked in to the ilikai on Aug 4 . We were first given a room on the 25th floor and the first thing we noticed once we opened the door was it was nowhere facing the water, partial ocean at best ( room 2538 ) if I am correct . We went down to the front desk and spoke with their supervisor on shift and she explained to us that the room is the same rate but she offered us a room simpler to the one we stayed on our last visit. (Room 2424)We thought that was the end of it till we came back from our dinner and I started noticing there was a few ants crawling on the kitchen table then my wife noticed there were ants on the kitchen wall , as we looked closer we noticed they were all over the room . We again call the front desk and had to be temporarily switch to a down graded room . The next morning, 7:30 am I was waken up by the sound of someone trying to open our room door , someone at the front desk has given another family our room thinking that it was empty and again I had to call the front desk .This is my vacation , I traveled close to 13 hours from New York and paid $ 5,000 plus dollars just to get here and every second of my time off is of great value to both my wife and I . With all this said , I leave it to the the reader of this review to decide if these unfortunate things are acceptable to you or not during your vacation. I do believe the Ilikai can do much much better than what had done so far .",,Lemonp,18,3.0

Once we arrived it was super busy at the entrance and parking was only via valet (which personally I don't prefer and rather have the option), but check in was fast and efficient. In fact the reception counter was never busy, even during check out, which is very surprising with all the rooms and guests the hotel has to accommodate. Our room was very spacious with a nice view of the Hilton and the lagoon. Decor was not new but clean which is the most important thing. Amenities were satisfactory. The aircon in one bedroom was making a loud noise, the water from the showers were too soft for our liking, plus there was no proper curtain in one bedroom to keep out the sunlight, but otherwise it was fine. With a proper kitchen, we cooked breakfast so never had to try the restaurant. Location-wise it is super convenient with a 5-minute walk to the beach, 10-minutes to Ala Moana mall, and an ABC store and McDonald's just across the road.

Overall the location, views & amenities were fantastic. Would stay again, but not at this condo.Watch out for the condo owners cancelling reservations. We booked several months ago (different condo on 21st floor) and about a month later the owner advised they were withdrawing the condo for the Summer. Full refund of our deposit but a bit of a hassle with currency exchanges and also trying to get two rooms nearby. Also our original room had a King bed, room divider & pull out couch. We were unable to find that again on this floor.2132 has two double beds. Not the most comfy - a bit stiff and not the nicest linens. Would have preferred Queens. Bathroom has a ""Japanese soakingtub"". If you have any flexibility issues DO NOT book a room with this. Huge barrier to climb in/out of shower. Luckily we got the other room with a normal walk in shower for my elderly in-laws.Overall the room was adequate but felt dated and a bit grubby. Was tidy and had a quick wipe down, but needs a good scrub and a do-over. Stove had dodged elements, no dishwasher so silverware and dishes were a bit crusty, lanai was filthy. I literally got out the mop and scrubbed it myself because my feet got sticky and black from walking around out there. My in-laws apartment was much newer, cleaner & had better furniture on the lanai.Two pools available with towels down there. Lovely warm water. No spa. Very strict rules about children jumping, diving, hanging on floating divider or being too loud. Was a bit much. A few grumpy old ladies floating in the deep end glared at us repeatedly. Shop in lobby pretty good , and ABC store either direction one block out the front door with more variety & a bit cheaper. Cinnamons restaurant really good and friendly staff, great for breakfast & pretty good for quick, casual family dinner. Short walk to lagoon, which was fun. 10-15 min walk to Ala Moana mall. Huge but you have to search out the non-elite stores. Gucci, Balenziaga, etc right in prime spot. If you want Old Navy you need to get a map & go searching.Definitely a the 'quiet' end of Waikiki. We walked down to Duke's for a drink one night (not so easy now as the beachfront boardwalk mostly gone) and couldn't believe the crowds & chaos.Plenty of rental car companies across the street at the Discovery Bay Ctr (small mall). Alamo, National, etc. we rented a very nice Jeep and did a drive around the island & went to the Outlet Mall (30 min drive West of Honolulu).Coffee shop on L floor quite good too for lattes, etc.We didn't have much to do with Ilikai staff as you get a code and just let yourself in. But they did help us order a taxi for the airport and were very helpful.Would happily stay again but would search for other condo which was newly refurbished and try to get queen /king or possibly stay at one of Ilikai hotel rooms as these seemed newer, with housekeeping & better quality furnishings.","Auckland, New Zealand","Trip811814</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",71,4.0

We were hesitant to book this property because of the age of the establishment. However, he pictures on the WaikikiBeachRental site looked great and the representative we spoke to made the property sound amazing. The Ilikai is certainly not a bad property, but didn't live up to our expectations. The grounds were well kept for the most part. The pools and lobby were nice. The property is in a okay location, but we felt there are much better choices to be more centrally located in Waikiki. For example, hotels around the beachwalk area would be nicer to access more by foot. Everything of interest to us seemed like a long walk from Ilikai. Luckily, we had a car and drove accessed most of Oahu that way. Again though, Ilikai is not a bad location. More important to note is unit 325. There was certainly lots of room in this unit, but did not live up to our expectations. The unit was advertised as being newly renovated. There were some newer appliances, maybe some furniture and some paint. However, it didn't feel updated at all. The pictures advertising the place looked MUCH nicer than it actually was. I guess it came down to the details. The beds were extremely uncomfortable. There were only two old run down A/C wall units for the entire unit. Both A/C couldn't keep the place cool and were in need a major cleaning. Just looking at the A/C units made you feel dirty. Our closet doors were falling off. Vents were full of dust. Little areas around the unit appear to have not been cleaned for a very long time (i.e. light switches, vents, etc.) . The balcony furniture was old and rusted. The balcony itself felt and looked dirty and clearly is not painted well. Be careful of what the pictures or agents advertise at the Ilikai. With all of that said, the place is certainly doable. We got by for our days here in Oahu and still had an amazing time. We just wouldn't rent again here. There are much better choices available that offer more value and updated rooms. Lastly, we should note, that we usually stay at a Marriott or Hilton and expect that kind of cleanliness when we arrive. The cleanliness of a condo/room means the most to us when traveling.

The apartment was light, airy and spacious. The kitchen was very well equipped with all the utensils required including a full sized fridge. The bathroom was very good with lots of space for all our things, they even included additional beach towels and extra bath towels. The Lanai was spacious with excellent views to the lagoon and the ocean, we had breakfast out here each day and drinks out here before we went to dinner each night. The king size bed was comfortable, pillows not so good if you like something firm. The apartment requires block out curtains as the sun rises every morning and comes into the apartment and wakes you up. There is a problem with the air con because there is only an over head fan in the living room and not in the bedroom. Also there is no reading light in the living room or on the lanai. There is an air conditioner in the bedroom but it is not split system so the person sleeping next to it got the full blast of the air and the air also pushed up the lamp on the bed side table and you had to be careful with the water glass on the bed side table. Apart from that the air con is very noisy, you can't sleep with the balcony doors open because at 4am every morning the delivery guys arrive at either Ilikai or the Hilton Hawaiin Village across the way. The car park exhaust fan is also very noisy constantly. When we tried to do our washing at the laundry facilities on our floor the machines were taken up by either hotel staff or contractors every day and even when we tried other floors everything was busy.

After days of researching and critiquing hotels, we chose the Ilikai and were very pleased with our decision. I booked this hotel on the internet through one of the Ilikai's ""chat"" reps. They beat any price I found on the discount sites! So please check with the hotel before booking on a discount site. Except for one small bump when we checked in (I booked for three people and they had me down for one and wanted to charge $90 more perDay) I showed the desk clerk a transcript of my convo with THEIR rep and she gave me the price the online rep. quoted. This desk clerk was the ONLY and I mean ONLY ""somewhat unpleasant"" staff we encountered here. Everyone else:maids waitresses, pool staff, valet, etc. were so welcoming and pleasant. So FYI if you book with their online Rep, have them send you a transcript of your conversation. Now on to the good part, the open-lobby is lovely, it has a fresh breeze flowing throughout and the water features added additional ambiance to the entry area. The veranda is a great place to rest, read or visit with others travelers. They have free DVD rental (with new releases much like Redbox rental machines). On Friday evening there is a fabulous fireworks show from the lagoon which was an additional perk, and our room had the perfect view!!!THE ROOM:Our room was very clean and the decorations were modern. We had a King Bed with a sofa bed. The bed and pillows were wonderful, and The sofa bed was very comfortable too. There were 3 adults in my party and the size of the room was adequate, but would get a little crowded with many more people. The views were breathtaking from our room #2416. The floor to ceiling windows/doors were great and allowed us to welcome the beautiful Hawaiian weather inside. While we didn't cook anything in the kitchenette, it was great to have a refrigerator for water/snacks and fresh coffee each morning. I will post pictures of the room.P.S. Our cleaning lady, Lei, was a jewel! She took very good care of us!THE BEACH: The beach is just a few steps away. While the Ilikai didn't have it own beach, Waikiki Beach is only about a 1/2 block away and visible from our room. The Hilton Lagoon is just out the back door and offers a lot of water activities. THE POOLS:Both pools were well maintained and not very crowded. We were able to get chairs each day without rushing to throw a towel down to reserve one. The small pool has a tanning ledge and water chairs. We loved it! There were very few children at the hotel during our stay, so very little splashing and sweet giggles.THE SHOPPING: There are a few shops in the hotel lobby, but the Ilikai is the perfect location for shopping. There are restaurants and shopping within walking distance. Many fun novelty shops as well as high end shops like Louis Vuitton and Kate Spade. Ala Moana drive is in the center of everything. Cinnamons:We are breakfast each day at Cinnamons. The breakfast food was very good with a delicious special each day! The hostess and waitresses were fantastic. I wish I would have written down their names.While this isn't a luxury resort, it is beautiful and full of Hawaiian culture!I will definitely stay at the Ilikai again, this hotel made our trip to Hawaii one to remember. I would have given 5-stars but there was no room service and the main elevators got a little crowded and had no A/C. ",,Debbie H,10,4.0

There is a convenience store on site, as well, for snacks, drinks and even souvenirs. The penthouse restaurant was a great place for happy hour and apps.

Each morning we woke up to this awesome view. The hotel is a 7min walk to Ala Moana shopping centre. It has the trolley bus stop at the door & the local bus stop. ABC convenience store, Restaurants & sports bar across the road. A very central location & not in the thick of the busyness of Waikiki. You can walk along the beach track from the hotel to Waikiki beach, about 30min easy walk. The hotel is next door to the Hilton Hawaiian Village where a fireworks show is held on the lagoon every Friday night. The hotel has Cinnamon restaurant that serves all day food. There is a restaurant on the top floor which serves cocktails from 3.30 at Happy Hour prices. Pool area is great & the gardens and courtyard very clean & well maintained. The booking staff are helpful & pleasant. Security is present around the hotel, which is great. They had hula classes, hula entertainment & music in the courtyard several nights. I would highly recommend this hotel. I would also highly recommend this room. Our Jetstar flight was delayed by 11hrs back to Oz. We contacted the rental place & was given the room to use for FREE for the extra day, until we left at 8pm..other travellers we spoke to either had to pay for an extra day or move out as scheduled.

It is away from the busy hustle-bustle streets of Kalakau Street where 90% of the tourist congregate, so you are not fighting the world for space. The condo conditions are a little aged but adequate. We saw many families with small children staying here due to the proximity of the lagoon pool near Hilton which is safer for children to use than the beach. There is also a regular swimming pool in the complex if salt water fun is not for you. The building has most of the conveniences one would need ranging from a ABC-like store to the Cinnamon restaurant in the building to the McDonald's across the street. One con to this place is like the con to most other places in Waikiki and that is parking for cars. You can valet park at $28 per day in this building or park in the lots behind the building at $1 per hour. Tip: If you need to park you car for no more than 10 hours (which would be returning from dinner or an evening drink at a bar) with NO in-and-out privileges, go to the building next to the Ilikai Marina Condos on Hobron Lane. They have a parking special which cost $7 for 10 hours so you could leave your car there overnight and retrieve it the next morning. It is also safer as it is indoor parking garage versus parking out in the street. However, be warned that you need to retrieve the car before the 10 hours are up or else you would be charged $8 for each overtime hour the car stayed parked there.",california,"chanyu1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>california</strong>",276,4.0

I didn't like that I couldn't call ahead so that our car was waiting as soon as we arrived downstairs. There were some days we were waiting more then 10mins for our car to be be available. There were also times we when we arrived back at the hotel behind a bank of cars that were waiting to be parked.We arrived early (1pm) off an international flight and our room wasn't ready. I knew check in wasn't till 3pm but we were really tired and we're hoping to check in early and sleep. So we a done pre-check-in and were sent away for a couple of hours until our room was ready. When we arrived back at 3.15pm our room still wasn't ready and they tried to change our room but we had booked a specific room so we could watch the fireworks from our room, so I told them we would wait for the room we booked. We then had to wait another 20mins for our chosen room and were eventually settled in our room just after 4pm.It might be worth noting that just as ppl are willing to pay extra for a late check out there are many ppl that would be willing to pay extra for an early check-in especially when coming off international flights. Give ppl a choice early check in or late check out, not everyone is coming in on late flights from the US mainland, a lot of ppl do visit Hawaii from Australia and they arrive early and check out early.We done a lot of research before we left home on things we wanted to do, so we had no need to use the concierge service but other guests told me they were excellent.We did not have the opportunity to eat at the restaurant so I am unable to review that. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel, we loved the sports bar across the road.

Everything about the room was perfect from the king bed to the furnishings and fully equipped kitchen. We also had a huge balcony overlooking the Marina. We loved the cocktails at Cinnamon's which has beautiful views but never had a meal there.There is a few restaurants near by and you can get the trolley bus at the front of the hotel straight into Waikiki for $2.There is a concierge desk in the foyer which we used to book 3 tours, 1 being to Pearl Harbour and the other to the shopping outlets and both went as planned. Unfortunately we were left extremely disappointed after booking a Sunset Cocktail Cruise for our last night which also happened to be our 43rd Wedding Anniversary and the reason for going to Hawaii in the first place. We paid $170 and were given a confirmation with the wrong pick up time. The correct time was 30 mins before the time we were given so after standing for 30 mins thinking they were running late we went back to the Concierge desk at Ilikai and even thought they admitted theyhad given us the wrong time we were made feel like it was our fault. It took over half and hour for them to agree to give us a refund but no other compensation to make up for their error which spoiled our night and we were left all dressed up with no other plans. I have since emailed the Ikilai but all I got back was sorry for the conventions. No one seems to get this was to be the highlight of out holiday which was a trip of a life time for us. My advise is be very wary of making booking at the Concierge desk at Ilikai as I would hate anyone else to be left as disappointed as we were. It would of been nice if the Ilikai had even offered us a voucher for dinner or even a couple of drinks at the bar but nothing, I was left to walk away in tears on what was to be a special night.","Newcastle, Australia","Anne-MarieHH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle, Australia</strong>",20,4.0

Our room was a 500sqft studio and was very well appointed and had a full kitchen with large appliances. The room had been totally refurbed and was a pleasure to stay in. The hotel location is excellent, being next to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, with some good restaurants, a 10 minute walk to the Ala Moana centre and the beach or lagoon very close. The Pink shuttle line stops at the front door, so its only a 10 minute ride to downtown Waikiki. It was a very pleasant 15-20 minute walk back from there.

All kinds of shops and Restaurants close by. There are two restaurants attached one is called Cinnamon's GREAT place with affordable prices and food is great.

However, these are minor points that did not really bother me as we did not spend much time in the room and were enjoying the beach and nice weather. The issue that really irritated me and one which I would caution others to be aware of when checking in is the hold that is taken on your credit card. I was told when checking in that one nights accommodation would be put on my credit card as a hold. Imagine my surprise when my credit card was declined whilst shopping a few days later and after checking my bank statement I found our entire 8 night stay had been charged to the card. After speaking to reception about this and explaining that it was only supposed to be a one night security and that I did not want to use that card for accommodation as it was an Australian card and would result in added fees, they explained that it was only a hold and that they could take the hold off if I provided them with a different card. I settled our account at this time using an American card and was assured that the hold should be off my card within a couple of hours. Same issue when I went to use my card again a couple of days later. After spending 10 minutes on a international call to my bank in Australia, I was informed that unless the business contacts the bank directly to remove the hold it will sit in pending for up to 10-14 days and that rather than going to the effort of contacting the bank, most businesses just wait for this period to lapse for the pending amount to be returned to the account. And if the bank is contacted directly it can still take up to 72 hours. That may be fine if it was one nights accommodation as I was informed at checking in, but the entire 8 night stay! Is this actually legal for the hotel to take a hold of the entire stay? I have never heard of this happening before, one nights accommodation yes, or a record of the card details in case the account isn't settled, but putting a hold on an entire stays worth of accommodation when you first arrive?! I will definitely be pursuing this matter further with relevant authorities. So, end result was I was unable to use my credit card for the entire trip which limited the shopping and activities I planned on doing, it was just lucky that I was not solely relying on this card for the trip or it would have been an absolute disaster. Please be very careful when checking in and do not use a card that you plan on using for your holiday or you will be in for a rude shock. Oh, I am now back in Australia and guess what, the amount is still pending on my card!In addition to this, reception staff were not very proactive regarding provision of information, it did not even feel like checking into a hotel as we were provided with no information regarding facilities or activities upon arrival. It was not until our 3rd day when we stopped into the timeshare office (separate to the hotel) whilst walking past to the beach to ask about volcano tours (as they looked like a tour booking office on first glance) that the lovely chatty man in the office told us there was a sundeck with pools on level 2 and an Italian rooftop restaurant, if it had not been for him we would not have even known there were pools in the hotel. I realise that you need to ask to receive information but usually at ""luxury"" hotels, reception staff go out of their way to inform you of all the facilities etc. available. My advice would be to give this hotel a miss and book into another nearby hotel with a good reputation such as the Hilton. The rates are comparable, the service is not.",,Ezpezo,2,2.0

Why do I say this? There are some major reasons below:1. Poor services at the front desk. The staff worked so slow on the check in time. There was 3 staff at the front desk but it took us 2 hours to do the check in after a very long flight from Melbourne, Australia (11 hour flight).2. As a big group, we had 40 pieces of checked in and carried on luggages but there was no one to help us to carry these luggages to the 22nd floor. We did it ourself! It took us another one hour to bring these super heavy luggages to the 22nd floor by hand! Remember, we had elder people who are 83 and 75 years old, and 4 children who are 7,10,13 years old.3. Stupid surcharge ""resort fee""!On the last day when we checked out, the front desk staff required us to pay USA $280 per room for the ""resort fee"" for 9 nights. We were in shock as we booked this hotel online and all the payment had been done 1 month before we came. So where was this stupid surcharge fee from? We hadn't been told about this when we checked in, which made us so upset. We felt like this hotel is a scam who robbed our money in a silent way! We asked why we paid this and what the resort fee was. The staff just said: ""This is the hotel policy. All customers have to pay."" They kept our credit card information when we checked in, so what could we do? They charged us after we left the hotel to the airport back in Melbourne. We were so so upset because we had not been told about this fee. If we had been told at the beginning, we wouldn't book this hotel or change another hotel right away! No respect for the customers at all!What is resort fee? As the staff said It is the coffee in my room that I used because I thought they were here for free as normal; wifi inside my room which we didn't use much as we left the hotel at 9am and came back 12 pm, every single day!; the towels that we used for going to the beach which only 1 towel for per customer per day! That's all!!!4. There was no tea, milk, coffee for free in the kitchen at all!5. The restaurant near the lobby was too expensive and the food was horrible. The service was too bad as we had to wait so long.6. The shower and bathtub are too old.7. Flowers at the lobby was too old and smelt like dead rats around the lobby.",,409ivyt,3,1.0

We stayed in a room with a kitchen so we didn't have to eat out for all meals. The room was light and bright, clean and spacious. The hotel has its own shuttle bus service into Waikiki and any hotels in the circuit. We used it a couple of times, but the walk to Waikiki is only 20 minutes flat and easy walking so we walked most times. There are washing machines for guests on most floors, this was very handy. We were on the second floor, so although we had a balcony to sit on it was too noisy due to the traffic noise, but still good to be able to open the door and not feel trapped. The windows were very well insulated and no noise penetrated when they were closed. We slept very well in a very comfy king sized bed.

We had 2 couples in 2 separate rooms on the 22nd floor. One overlooking the marina and the other overlooking the lagoon, both ocean views. The lagoon side room has views of the fireworks and activity below but straight ahead off the balcony you are looking directly into the hotel next door. The ocean view is off to the side. It's not terrible but the hotel does somewhat block the ocean view. The marina side view had the city to the right and the ocean and the park across the way to the left. We were high enough that no building was directly in our view path. Both are very good choices and I agree with the other comments about having a room on the upper floors. We couldn't seem to coordinate to catch the free trolley. We were given an app to track them but it sometimes didn't work. The front desk staff was pleasant but didn't seem completely knowledgeable about schedules and activities. I asked how long the hula performers were going to be on the patio so I could let my parents know if they would have time to get there and the response was ""are they (the performers) still out there?"" she didn't know the schedule. I also asked on a separate occasion whether the fireworks would be going on even if it rained and was told yes they always have them. We did have some light rain (heavier rain was expected) and we sat by the lagoon waiting along with many others but the fireworks had been cancelled.

We stayed for 11 nights.The room itself is a good size, we found the bed comfortable and it was handy having the kitchen - we cooked at the apartment a few times. I did think it was odd that there's no rangehood above the oven especially when cooking on the stovetop.The bathroom is a good size, plenty of counter space - there's no bath just a shower but that's fine. There is very little storage in the room though for suitcases etc which was a pain, especially for a longer stay.We visited the store downstairs and the ABC across the road but did find the Safeway which was a huge supermarket so did a couple of big shops there - much more economic than the smaller shops.Location wise it's only a 10 min walk to Ala Moana shopping Centre, we really liked the food court there as did our kids. We used the hotel shuttle, it's not overly reliable and we had some pretty long waits so ended up catching a cab on multiple occasions.Each morning we would get our coffee from Aroma downstairs - reasonable coffee. We avoided Cinnamons after a very disappointing breakfast on our first morning at the Ilikai - my breakfast of bacon and eggs was appalling.There is a show every Friday night followed by fireworks at the lagoon - they are at 7.30pm and worth watching.We used both pools, there's very little shade with the bigger pool and the bathroom is really in need of a facelift. This being said, our family really enjoyed swimming in the big pool as it's really deep.The hotel is pretty pricey so we will shop around a bit more to ensure we are getting the best value for money when we return.

Checked into the ilikai with no problem. Used a Credit Card for the hold and paid the resort fee up front with my debit. Went to our room where everything was nice and tidy. The room came with pots/pans etc for our long stay which was really nice to have, because we did end up making dinner a few times during our stay. The TV was a bit outdated, but that's fine we're not there for TV. The AC blew fine which was considerably nice due to the fact we paid for a ""Ocean Sunset View"" and boy does it boil in those rooms! Second night and continued throughout our stay our AC unit kept turning off or not turning on at all! Called maintenance and they fixed it the first time. Second time it took them 2 days to do something about it, but yet it still kept turning off and we had a 3 Year old with us which made matters worse in a hot room..this goes for day and night.Overall our stay was average minus the AC issue. Cinnamons was decent. The Cafe down stairs was a plus. Issues arose upon check out. Everything seemed fine. Checked out at the front desk and was given a receipt. Asked if we owed anything else and was told no I was good to go!Apparently I wasn't, because 2 hours later sitting in the airport waiting for my plane I get a call from some staff member at the Ilikai who states I owe for Parking, Upgrade fee, Resort fee etc.1. I paid for the upgrade fee a week before I even flew into Hawaii.2. Resort fee was paid upon checking. 3. Parking I provided him a card over the phone since he was so persistant in getting something from me? Even though I am pretty sure I paid since I was told everything was good upon checkout. Today's 5/11 I checked out 5/9 and I get charged a resort fee!? Which I've already paid. Called Ilikai and for some reason I get the same guy again. He tells me they never charged me it was a Hold on my card. Uh no I gave you a Credit Card for a hold and paid with a debit card for the fees! Even have my Receipts. Well sure as heck he continues to argue with me. Worse case if Ilikai doesn't reach out to me and correct the issues at hand I'll be doing a charge back for said fee's since i was charged without consent.

The car valet staff, front desk staff, concierge, housekeeping and others were welcoming and gave us a great Aloha! experience. We stayed on one of the renovated floors - with a great view of the lagoon and the ocean (well worth the extra price) to enjoy a morning coffee on the balcony or just listen to the sound of the ocean.

We had a king size bed . There are a few rooms I believe with 2 double beds too which we could have had if we had waited until 2 pm but as the suite with king and sofa bed was available at 10:30 am and the hotel was happy to let us have it early, we took that and were happy with it.There are 25 floors and then the penthouse level and 1 benefit of being on the higher floor is that the lifts often fill up as you descend and people on lower floors often have to wait for the next lift.You can't see the hilton fireworks from the sunset wing but we walked out to Magic Island at Ala Moana and had a great view from there.My husband and kids enjoyed watching airplanes leaving and arriving afar off in the distance at Honolulu airport from the lanai . Fun to watch if you are an airplane fan and you will get a nice view of this from the sunset wingThere is a kitchen and it was handy to have the microwave and fridge and nice to perch on the bar stools and eat / read on the bar.We liked the location as it is a 10 minute walk to Ala Moana Shopping Centre and a 20 minute stroll to Waikiki.The hospitality fee of $18/d covered good wifi, beach towels ( which we took on excursions ) and beach chairs ( can carry down to Fort De Russy beach to enjoy) and DVD/ playstation 3 game rental as well as use of the shuttle. There is a free shuttle which does loops from the hotel to Waikiki and to Ala Moana shopping centre and stops at several Aqua hotels which serve as good pick up/drop off points for different parts of Waikiki. You can track the shuttles in real time on the internet site as to where they are in real time and expected arrival times at each stop. Last shuttle about 9 pm . We used the shuttle a few times in the heat of the day but its quite pleasant to walk in the cooler morning and evening .There was a large commercial standard laundry washing machine and dryer on our floor which cost $2.50 in coins per load for a wash or dry cycle and the machine could take a massive amount of clothes . Very efficient . Half an hour wash and 1 hour dry. Cash can be exchanged for coins at reception. We had brought our own laundry powder but you can buy from dispensing machine in laundry.The reception staff and housekeeping are lovely. They appear to be long term employees and happy in their jobs.We ate at Cinnamons a few times - it gets very busy on weekends for breakfast as many come from outside the hotel for their guava pancakes which are a huge serve and worth trying . Try Magokoro nearby for lunch and Wailana coffee house serves good value diner food. We liked the Japan Village walk food court at the Ala Moana Centre opposite foodland under Nordstroms.The only thing lacking is a good swimming pool but I think if you come to Oahu , it's best to swim at the beach. If you want to have access to a swimming pool and be beachfront then the Ilikai may not be for you . However I think you get a more spacious room with a kitchen for a more reasonable price than the beachfront Waikiki hotels and we don't mind the walk .

The sunset view was incredible and the room was exactly as pictured on the website. I chose this hotel as I wanted a kitchenette. The kitchen was very well equipped with almost everything you could need for a week stay (except maybe food storage containers, but no biggie). I did cook about 4 or 5 dinners there so the kitchen was put to good use. The housekeeping was also very good. Please note that if you stay in a room with a sunset view you will not be able to see the fireworks show from your balcony that the Hilton next door puts on Friday and Tuesday (I think?) night. You will need a room on the other side of the hotel. The only other downer was that the pool was closed during our stay -- and nobody told us until we got down there. The pool itself, if it had been working -- was very underwhelming. Nothing special about it at all. Our room looked down on the two pools next door at The Modern Hotel and we were very envious.

The Ilikai has recently renovated their top floors and we were pleased to see the photos well matched our experience.Things we liked:The modern clean design of the rooms (see attached photo)The ocean view was quite nice although not all ocean as the hotel is set back from the beach by several 100 meters (see attached photo)The staff were friendly and helpful, especially housekeeping.Air conditioner was modern split unit, very effective and pretty much silentWalk in tiled showerGood quality bedFree wifi in rooms and throughout hotel. Wifi bandwidth and reliability was excellent in the rooms.Close to public bus stop which always provided a ride down the beach if we were in a hurry or tires of walking. It's $2.50 per person and valid for two hours in any direction.Taxi to airport cost about $30, better than taking the shuttle if you're a couple.Fresh beach towels and beach chairs available every day for free.Things that we didn't like:Pool area lacked charm. Wasn't an area we want to hang out at when compared to other properties. Cinnamon's Restaurant was a goodPlace for breakfast but didn't have Much atmosphere. We ended up having several meals and drinks at the neighbor property which is a boutique hotel. Tiny TV, too small to be etched from bed.I'd recommend this hotel ifyou're looking for a lower cost suite very near the beach at the quiet end of Waikiki.

After doing this year in and year out we have tired of eating meals out in restaurants not just the cost just can be a bit of a rat race in Waikiki if you don't really want to do it just need to gets done (eating) gets very old after while.We were very pleased with the room( 2436) we were assigned everything had been remodeled looked like new , the living room had a comfortable chair and couch in a nice pit area with a large flat screen TV ,the other part of the room had a king size bed that was arranged in such a way that you could easily watch TV from that part of the room as well.The kitchen had everything we needed full sized stainless steel appliances ample cabinet space .Bathroom was large and nicely done huge vanity top to spread out on .The Lani was huge by standards we were use to over the years in the hotel room down by the zoo and nice views of Dukes Lagoon, Pacific Ocean, and Hilton Hawaii village I enclosed a couple pictures I took from the Lani the one of Dukes Lagoon and Pacific Ocean was taken on super bowl Sunday 1st quarter ( lol ) what a view.This hotel seems to be a favorite of seniors tho my wife and I are still working we did enjoy the quiet and there ability to keep order very little shenanigans going on in this hotel one evening there was a very loud obnoxious group on the Lani above us when the hour got a little Late I did call the desk they had had a few other complaints but we're having trouble locating the problem guests after my call there was silence and that was the end of the problem I was very impressed. We have had similar problems in other hotels the management in that facility give me nothing but lip service and the nonance continued if you're Looking for a quieter building this might be your place. One last thing I didn't mention the money was very comprable to our Oceanfront Hotel room at the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel we double the square footage and added all those amenities.Not knocking the Aston hotel because we've had many good trips there and we love that end of town but we were really really impressed with the Ilikai has really given us something to think about for next year's trip.Also before I close this hotel has 2 nice pools and easy access to both Dukes Lagoon and Waikiki Beach in front of Hilton Hawaiian Village a very nice strip of Waikiki Beach.

Upon check in I learnt that TripAdvisor was wrong and all the rooms in the entire hotel are the same size and all have open plan 1 King bed and 1 sofa bed.I was pretty upset about it but the manager contacted me and refunded me 1 night plus the resort fee and gave us a voucher for breakfast on one day of our stay. I can honestly say I would not have booked this motel had I have known what the correct room configuration was so I was definitely misled by the TripAdvisor listing. Having said that, the positives are;The location is perfect, about half way between the Royal Hawaiian centre and Ala Moana Mall if your into shopping; great restaurants only steps away; easy access to the Hilton Hawaiin Village with all its restaurants shops and facilities. Easy access to a lovely beach area, you can even sit on the lawn under shade whilst beaching it if you walk a block to Fort DeRussy and go to the beach there, it's also a great place to people watch as there are constant games of volleyball plus beach hire for paddle boards, surf boards, water bikes etc.The rooms are spacious and it's definitely worth paying extra to have an ocean view; our room had a PlayStation, good size flat screen and free unmetered high speed wifi in fact I had my hdmi cable with me so plugged the iPad into the tv and streamed movies every night and no problem with speed at all. There's a good 7/11 type shop in the hotel and a good Lunch and brekky spot as well.The only 2 negative's I have found is the hot water is not hot enough and I have tried it at varying times of the day. I can't find anything in the room that regulates the temp so I presume it's resort wide. I have had no cold on at all when having a shower, just the hot water full on and with not full on it is a normal temp hot shower as in its not cold or warm it is hot. But you know how on a cold day or when you come back from a swim and step into an airconditioned room and you just want a nice hot shower to warm up your bones? The showers here are not hot enough to satisfy that situation. The second is no drinks are provided at the sunbathers shallow pool, I'm not sure about the deeper pool but I haven't spotted any drinks when looking down on the area from above.The room is comfortably big enough for 3. If you have mum and dad in the king bed and 1 child on a roll away up against the verandah curtains, you can leave the couch as is and still have a living area. If you had 4 people I would recommend getting a 2nd roll away and not using the sofa bed as without a sofa to sit on it could become difficult. There would be room for the second rollaway next to the King bed with a bed side table width between. Sorry one other is that there is no kettle in the room, only a coffee maker which made it hard when the kids just wanted a cup of noodle soup as I had to boil water in a saucepan.One other positive is each floor has a laundry with drink and ice machine and detergent dispenser so it really has everything you need.One more hint, if you need a hire car, Envy car hire will deliver the car to the hotel and pick it up from hotel when your finished.I would definitely stay either here or at the Hilton next door if I come back to Hawaii although if you don't need to be in the thick of the resort area, I would stay at the Kahala:)",,Tracie R,19,4.0

Friendly staff as well. - Also 2 ABC stores within close proximity.- Duke lagoon is very close, suitable for kids.- Proximity to Hilton also means really good fireworks view.- Walking distance to Ala Moana.CONS:- Not sure if its just because we booked with Marina Hawaii Vacations, but only a very small starter kit is provided. We ran out of rubbish bags and toilet paper and had to top up twice.- kitchen utensils and equipment is dated.- carpet is old, we wore slippers in the room all the time.- Valet parking is terrible at peak times,they almost lost our car once. Took us 20 minutes to sort everything out with 2 screaming kids.- Nothing to do at night.- Not many restaurants close by.CONCLUSION:Illikai is good if you are looking to stay off the main strip, want to be close to Ala Moana and dont want to do anything at night and are happy to do takeaways or eat at the hotel.If you are looking for the stereotypical Waikiki experience this is not the place to stay.",,kavith,14,3.0

This summer was our 8th year in Oahu. Ilikai is an old hotel, almost historic. Part of it are hotel rooms, partially owned by individuals as short term rentals and etc. There is not a whole lot going for the building other than its location. It is a huge structure, due to its size and age there are some drawbacks. To start with there is no AC in the building. Hallways need upgrade. Couple of years ago hotel renovated few of the upper floors and units and sold them. Each individual unit has its own AC unit in the balcony (lanai). Some of those also older AC units and make too much noise and ruins your enjoyment of the lanai. The worse part is the roaches. Even though the entry of the building and most of the rental units seem to be clean unfortunately there are roaches every where. They usually come out at night, if you are walking bare feet inside the unit, in the dark, be careful you may step on one big crunchy roach. Never leave food on the counter, put everything in the fridge and take your trash out daily sometimes 2x a day. Having said that, the units facing the ocean and the marina have beautiful views. Some units are renovated and fairly tastefully decorated. If you want to stay there look at the pics, don't pick any of the older ones which has carpet on the floor. The whole building needs to be sprayed for roaches on regular basis. In that size of a building if you cant do the whole thing at once those creatures will travel from one section to another. All public areas and private units have to be done at the same time. Most units are studio's, some are 2 bedrooms as well as the penthouses. It is not cheap to stay there but I guess you are paying for the location and free roaches !!!!!","Denver, Colorado","geysug</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",49,3.0

It included a living area with a sofa, 2 chairs, and a coffee table. A full kitchen with recent full size stainless steel appliances. A slightly larger than usual bathroom also remodeled recently. Overall, the room had everything I expected. The only thing missing was a desk but most people won't need one. Also, the A/C unit was way to noisy. The location of the hotel was good but not great. It is within walking distance (10mn) from a very big mall. You'll have some dinning options but most of them are on the not so healthy side and all are relatively expensive. Good thing that I had a full kitchen. What made the Hotel location not great is that it had no direct access to the beach. It's not far, perhaps 5mn from room to sand, but I would have liked a more direct access. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.

The room was spacious, cozy and very clean with full kitchen and refrigerator. Hotel is located very close to Hilton Hawaiian Village, Lagoon, Waikiki beach, dining areas, bars within walking distance. Convenient store and gift stops, casual dining area is located on the 1st floor and coin laundry machines are on every floor- so every thing was very convenient for a week stay. Shuttles and bus line stops right in front of hotel area, thus easily get to anywhere using public transportation. We have used pink line shuttle to Shopping center for free( for JBC card holder- whole family is without charge ) One thing to mention, We reserved the ocean view room expecting to see the ocean in the room but the view from the room was city(building view) and were able to see the ocean from the balcony area. We asked to the staff the front desk if there were mis-arrangement on the room type, but there wasn't. It supposed to be able to see the ocean from the balcony between the two buildings. So that was a little disappointing because when making the reservation, the ocean room was a bit higher priced than the city view or half ocean view rooms. I dont see a reason to spend more to reserve ocean room?- except that, everything els were good.

I had several non-working items: AC blew hot air (did get fixed the second night), Wifi was a disaster and cut out every 5 seconds (which was a problem because I was there for work), safe didn't work (and did not get fixed). There was no information in the room about where to eat etc . I had to try and go online to find out about the restaurants (which took forever since the wifi cut out constantly). The valet staff, albeit friendly overall, stood around and watched guests lug their suitcases up and down the stairs, instead of assisting.

The location is perfect - close enough to walk to both Ala Moana Shopping Mall and the Waikiki Beach area, or easy to catch the Pink Line bus right outside the front of the building.Our apartment was a private rental, booked through Waikiki Beach Rentals, and was located on the Penthouse floor (2607 - The Sky Penthouse). As a family of five adults, we had a comfortable stay in the apartment and really appreciated the air conditioning as well as the full kitchen. We had no trouble with noise, and found the whole floor to be quiet and peaceful. The view from the lounge and main bedroom is incredible - we could see Diamond Head, the lagoon and the beach, and we were also able to watch the Hilton Hawaiian Luau, as well as their fireworks show, right from our lanai. For those who are interested in an apartment review, for penthouse accommodation, the size of the lanai was slightly disappointing as it was very thin and difficult for us all to enjoy it at the same time. On arrival, we were unfortunately disappointed with the level of cleanliness of the floor. The apartment has tiles throughout, and by the end of our first night, the bottoms of our feet were very dirty. After staying in other privately owned apartments, we were also surprised to see that there was no washing powder included. We ended up going to the Laundrette on the level below and purchased some from one of the machines. We loved the facilities at the Ilikai Hotel that were included in our condo stay. Access to the pool was enjoyed by the whole family, as well as the live music in the lobby on weekends, and we adored the lovely staff (particularly Maurice!) in the convenience store downstairs. There is no shortage of fantastic eating options nearby, and we enjoyed meals at many of these restaurants including Bubba Gump (Ala Moana), Outback Steakhouse, Wailana Coffee House and Goofy Café & Dine, and we loved having a McDonalds right across the road. We walked just a couple of blocks to the Food Pantry on Hobron Lane to do our grocery shopping for the week.We rented a car during our stay, and chose Alamo Rent A Car, which is located in the Discovery Bay Centre across the road. Rather than using the valet parking in the hotel, we utilised the self parking behind the Red Lobster, which was $20 a day.Overall, we had a wonderful week at the Ilikai, and can't wait to return to Waikiki one day soon!","Tasmania, Australia","FyfeFamily</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tasmania, Australia</strong>",7,5.0

The hotel was attractive, numerous elevators and 2 pools.The room was like a condo on the 25th floor, and had a lanai that overlooked the harbour and featured beautiful views of the ocean and sunsets. The lanai was large and relaxing.The room featured a stove, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, toaster and dishes/utensils. It was a modern looking room, king bed, large screen tv and walk in shower for 2.The bed was ok, not incredibly comfortable. There was an electronic safe and closet for hanging clothes. The maid came in during mornings to clean the room and restock towels/coffee.The price was very good compared to other hotels with similar features. The resort fee was $18 compared to $30 that most charge. We had towels and chairs for the ocean, dvd and playstation games available to us.I visited the adult pool with relaxing lounge chairs in the water. The pool was not for swimming but rather relaxing. There were lots of lounge chairs and umbrellas available.Across the street was ABC store that sold everything, McDics, a Wing place, Outback, Red Lobster and other restaurants. All tours that we booked picked us up right in front of the hotel and was a main pick up for most tours and hotels in the area.The beach was a short walk and was in front of the Hilton.I would stay here again and recommend it to others.

This was our fourth trip to Hawaii and we normally stay in central Waikiki, so it was a nice change to check out this end of Waikiki (near the Marina/Ala Moana shopping centre). We payed a bit extra to get a room with an ocean view and this was superb on the 25th floor (room 2516 on the 2nd highest floor). The Ilikai is 50 years old, but overall is very well maintained and retains an attractive appearance in all common areas such as lobby, lifts, corridors and main driveway. Off the open-air lobby there are a small number of shops including a casual restaurant/cafe, a good coffee shop and Whaler's (similar to ABC shop). Our room was a 'junior suite' and included a stove, microwave and large fridge and therefore you could store/prepare some meals if desired (this is above most basic hotel rooms). The room overall was very nice, but did have a couple of marks on the carpet and a lot of marks on the wall on one side of the bed, where I suggest people store/open their suitcases (as there is no where else). It is an easy walk to/from the Ala Moana shopping centre, that has a large number of shops including some restaurants and a food court.

The Ilikai is an iconic hotel at the northern end of Waikiki which makes it handily located to the shopping at Ala Moana, the less populated but just as good beaches behind Hilton Hawaiian Village and all the action of central Waikiki is only 10 minutes stroll away. This seemed a very safe and thankfully quieter part of Waikiki and not once did we feel for our safety whilst wandering around at night As many others have, we rented through Waikiki Beach Rentals and found them very easy and professional to deal with. The condo was on the 20th floor (2020) with a beach and lagoon view. The best aspect I believe as it not only afforded the best views of fireworks, Hilton luau and beach etc but was well positioned for morning sun whilst avoiding the heat of the afternoon sun experienced on the marina side of the building. The condo was well maintained and fitted out with all the comforts needed and was well presented on arrival. The use of a keypad for entry rather than a card or key was very handy and most welcome. Good air conditioning, towels were plentiful, the granite kitchen had reasonable appliances and utensils for cooking if you preferred. New full sized fridge, large Sony Bravia TV, comfortable bed and adequate indoor and outdoor furniture. Cleaning during a condo rental is in your own hands for the duration of your stay but can be paid for if you wish. Vacuum cleaner, brooms etc all provided. The highlight feature is definitely the lanai to sit out on with a morning coffee or evening beer and to just soak in the view. All was well maintained and very clean on arrival. Early check in is available at a $30 fee otherwise its 3pm in as usual with most hotels. Something to consider and arrange if you have an early arriving flight.The Ilikai complex itself has a few shops and a very well priced and perfectly good ground floor restaurant in Cinnamon's that was fine for informal dinners serving a good range of delicious food and also does a pretty mean breakfast. The bar was a great place to unwind for evening cocktails with live music and a sunset view over the marina. On top of the hotel is Sarentos Restaurant which was a more formal venue that also served excellent food with some of the best views you will find. There are many good restaurants within a 5 -15 minute walking range but it still amazes how we often find some of the better places are often within the hotel where you stay.As a condo guest you have limited contact with the hotel staff but are able to use the concierge to book tours etc. We found them very friendly and professional to deal with when booking a hire car and a tour. The advantage of condo rental is definitely price and value. The disadvantage, if you could call it that, is that you are pretty much self sufficient for your stay. However, our travelling companions had a small wifi issue in their condo which was dealt with promptly by who we presume was the hotels onsite maintenance people so you are not completely on your own in a time of need. Reassuring. There is a lot to like about the ilikai. Certainly not pretentious or claiming to be 5 star but seems to be clean, well maintained for its age and run by a friendly and efficient crew. We found nothing at all to criticize or dislike about our choice of accommodation and an Ilikai condo will be definitely be our first choice for our next visit.",Australia,"Austin-Powers63</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",69,5.0

When I sent emails to make enquiries they responded straight away.When we opened up the room you could smell it was clean. Everything was spotless. And it had everything you could need. There were beach chairs, boogie board and snorkelling gear left for us to use. It also has a full kitchen just in case you want to cook breaky, lunch or dinner. The king size bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in whilst on holidays and the pillows were super soft. We had a fireworks / ocean /pool view. It was magnificent. The friday night fireworks were amazing and we had uninterrupted views of the ocean and the lagoon.The lagoon was wonderful to swim in and it would be ideal for anyone with little children. Just a 2 mins walk from the unit. The pool was also great. The Waikiki Trolley has a stop in front of the hotel and the Tour Booking Girls at the hotel were fantastic. The Cinnamon restaurant is on the ground floor as well. We only had breaky there a few times but they make the best pancakes and at reasonable price. The Ala Moana Shopping Centre is only 1 trolley stop away or a nice 10 min stroll. It has a huge market place and lots of great shopping.

The hotel pool is available for use, there is a great coffee shop below - normal coffee as in Australia which we had every day. We mostly dined out but had 2 breakfast's in the downstairs restaurant which was typically American style - omelettes and pancakes if you chose them. The master bedroom was very spacious like a family living room. The second bedroom led to the second ensuite and the den closed off with a sofa bed that our 30yr old daughter slept peacefully on. The master ensuite was a little tired but functional and I thought the $495US per night was quite reasonable considering we had 2 families essentially and I would thoroughly recommend this for similar situations. On site parking was $28US a day which took up to 11pm at night but we only used this on the first day to make it easier for the bags etc; We used the nearby Red Lobster carpark once at $20US a day but there is 6 hour free parking at the beach but that ceases at 10.30pm and the vehicles are then towed. A number of bays along the water side of the hotel at $US1/hr and free parking at Ala Moana Shopping Centre which is about an easy 10min walk so we parked there during the day when not using the vehicle or at the 6hr free parking and then of an evening at the $US1/hr overnight, mostly only costing $US 10-12 a night. 20min walk to Waikiki shopping precinct and the Duke's lagoon at the front of the hotel was perfect for a dip as was the beach.

We were attending Hawaii for the 1st time to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary.So glad we chose the Ilikai, the room we stayed in was Room 2302 had the most awesome view and was absolutely beautiful.From the moment we walked in everything about our stay was fantastic. Rod at the front desk was just terrific and couldn't have been more helpful, he was such a great guy and so helpful with any questions or queries we had.The room was sooo beautiful and so clean and well maintained. The pool area is so gorgeous and so relaxing. Cinnamons is delicious at any time of day.The local shop is so well stocked you really need never leave the hotel should you so desire.The hotel is situated right outside a bus stop and the Concierge couldn't be more helpful in booking tours for you or giving you information on buses to catch etc.Being so close to Ala Moana shopping centre is a bonus and also going on bus tours meant we would be the last to be collected and the first to be dropped off which was great after a long day or night event.Everything about the Ilikai is great in our opinion and we will be definitely telling family and friends to check out the Ilikai for their visits.Thank you to everyone at the Ilikai for making our stay so enjoyable we have wonderful memories that we will have forever and we couldn't be happier.Thank you for everything","Sydney, Australia","harley268</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",5,5.0

We stayed on the 11th floor with a Marina view. Ilikai is only 5 mins walk away from Ala Moana shopping centre, and conveniently located close to Teddys Bigger Burgers, Don Quixote supermarket, Wal-Mart, Ross dress for less and TJ Maxx. The Ilikai lobby is pretty amazing, the convenience store is well priced. I used the laundry facilities every other day. Buy your own washing powder as theirs isn't great. $2.50 for a small box of powder, $2.50 for a 26 minute normal wash and $2.50 for the dryer (never used, I hung clothes over chairs on the lanai). Each Friday there is a firework show at the lagoon. It starts at 7:45, lasts for 3 minutes and is amazing. Cinnamons have a great selection of cocktails to try. The Pink line trolley stops right outside the Ilikai and each trip is $2 per person. In our room we had 2 double beds and a queen size pull out couch bed. This was extremely uncomfortably for two people has the springs were coming in from the sides. The double beds were quite comfortable. The AC was extremely effective. The Iliikai is great for families and couples. The pool is heated and has loungers around the pool. The attendants give u as many towels as you want. ",,southernmummy5,15,5.0

The rooms were very nice and had everything we needed. The kitchen was great with a full size refrigerator, microwave, and plenty of plates, cups, and eating utensils. The room had a decent sized flat screen TV as well as a Play Station 3. In the lobby was a rental machine that you could get new release movies and video games to use with the Play Station. We really enjoyed being able to grab a new movie each night and relax in our hotel after a long day exploring the island. The bed was pretty firm but still comfortable to sleep on and the pillows were a typical hotel pillow that allowed your head to sink to the bed as soon as you laid on them. Had to fold mine or stack two on top of each other in order to be comfy. The bathroom was very modern and clean with a decent sized shower and lots of counter space. The staff at the hotel were all very nice and friendly. The security guards weren't the friendliest or most professional I've seen but that's not at fault to the hotel since they were from a private security company. The lobby of the hotel has a decent restaurant, but nothing amazing, as well as a few little shops including a market that was very handy for us to buy drinks and other small items to stock our fridge with. We never checked out the pool but why would you when the beach was literally a minute walk away. Our favorite part was definitely the proximity to the Hilton lagoon as well as the beach which was just directly behind the hotel and easily accessed with a pathway straight from the lobby. The only negative critique we had during our stay was with the Wi-Fi. We were first unable to log on at all and a maintenance person had to come to our room and even call the service provider before being able to fix it. Once it was fixed we still fought with it our whole trip since the connection was very poor and would go in and out on a regular basis. Luckily we didn't need Wi-Fi too much so it didn't effect us terribly. All in all we really enjoyed staying here and would definitely consider coming back on future trips to Hawaii.","Bellingham, Washington","Cody P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bellingham, Washington</strong>",7,4.0

You still get the same similar view from a slightly different angle in the even numbered rooms ranging 1911-1926. We normally do the all-inclusives but here in Hawaii at the Ilikai we went full out with a full kitchen. A scissors would be a welcome addition to the utensil supply - but the sharp steak knife worked good enough. Still we kept in-room preparation down to a minimum as there are plenty yummy places to dine - just be prepared to pay the typically higher State prices. Honourable mention goes to the Tropics Bar and Grill, LuLu's and Cheesebuger Hawaii - yum, yum and more yum - search them out. The first one even provided an excellent sunset dinner complete with a band with good tunes named the Pyranhas I think. Search out the Food Pantry for good prices to stock your fridge and cupboards. A blender was provided but we brought along our own ninja for daily green smoothies! We liked the room but from the online booking it seemed like there was only rooms with one king sized bed. Our special request for a room with two beds was honoured making our stay most comfortable. The alternative would have poor Randy sleeping on the couch or floor lol. I brought along a long extension cord and it worked well to enable me to power/charge a couple of devices bedside. AC outlet space was limited and not so convenient. It is a retro hotel after all. We had no issue with room service. We left tips from time-to-time and a bigger one on check-out. But not sure if it was a resident or guest that was ragging on a housekeeper one day for not doing an adequate job. She was not quiet about it with her door hanging open. Both having been in the resort-service industry, we felt bad for the housekeeper. While we didn't have all the facts, the incident could have been handled out of guest' view.The Hotel.The island of Oahu is rich in historic/popular celebrity residencies (not like the Vegas-style celeBritany-residencies lol). The Ilikai is no different with Hawaii Five Oh opening scene shots and John Lord even lived in the Penthouse for a time. The hotel was one of the originals and as such our floor was very retro. The 22nd floor looked renovated and this is where we went for side-pop and ice even though ice cube trays are provided in the roomy freezer. A couple of washers and a couple of dryers in each floor's laundry room helped to keep luggage down to carry-on size. I would say if you are pressed for time on any of your ascents or descents on the elevator - take the bather's elevator as it seems quicker and less used. But most times we got good runs up or down one of the five main elevators without too many milk runs. We were disappointed on our last night stay when we went up to the 30th floor Piano Bar and Restaurant for happy hour forty percent off food pricing. Expensive as expected. Great ambiance and views. Excellent service. Classy. Classy licks from the piano player. And the disappointment comes from the outside-looking glass elevator being out of service. One of the five main elevators took us to the penthouse (floor 26+) where we used penthouse accessible elevators to Sarento's on 30th. The main floor lobby is spacious and I love standing in the BREEZE-WAYs leading into the hotel. There is nothing like that rush of air to refresh you! Wander around back for some shaded seating after wandering through a calming landscape of trees, plants, birds, flowers and water. Unless otherwise-specified most places on the island encourage you to pick the flowers. They grow plentiful. When checking-in and at the front desk, turn to your right and go immediately to the far end and get a refreshing small cup of lemony ice cold water - schlurp! A ramp down back of the hotel provides easy access to the beach and lagoon. The hotel provides extra beach towels and close-to-the-ground seats if you like. We only used that service once. Hotel service fees also got us free DVD selections too but such activity never came up. The TV went on rarely before bedtime. A daily newspaper arrived at our door each morning which was our source for an Annual Greek festival happening down at the Ala Moana Park that we walked to. We opted for a nice walk of that beach at the same time in preference over walking the Ala Moana shopping center across the street which would have also given our step counters something to brag about too lol.Amenities.The Ilikai Hawaiian Aroma Cafe on the main floor serves up a mighty yummy Coco Choco Mocha - yum! For you smokers, the hotel is non-smoking by law. Just ignore those who ignore the law and don't look too closely at surrounding balconies or ya might find the odd ashtray sitting on lanai tables lol. We abided and early morning/ late evening smokes were had in the designated benches out back overlooking the marina where Gilligan's Isle opening scenes were filmed. Other times right out-front off to the side by some parking offered a good shaded smoking area. If the shade don't matter - out back will bake ya good as did us from time to time. Yes we know, bad habit - but we seem to be only vacation smokers. Can't get menthol smokes in Alberta Canada anymore - dontchya know! The main floor Oahu Market has a good variety store selection where I got my lemons to make something one guest called my ""poor man's lemonade"". Hooked on half a squeezed lemon (I brought a small manual juicer too), a bit of sugar, lots of ice and spring water purchased from the market. If need-be almost every street corner has a ""first-three-letters-of-the-alphabet"" store. I picked up some large plastic cups from somewhere like that - but I preferred the plastic over the provided glasses and coffee cups - especially for out on the lanai and in the bathroom. There was good supply of towels and papya-based soap, shower gel, moisturizer, shampoo and conditioner. We got our concentrated sunshine for about an hour every day pool-side. Morning time about nine after the lane swimming ends did us well with always a couple of lounge chairs by the pool. They are kid friendly with their floatation devices and most entertaining watching parents teaching their kids to swim. One could do a blog about the swim-coaching methods of parents at the Ilikai pool and maybe make a book of it - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly - we saw it all at other times of the day.Getting Around Town.Doing a couple of tours? We found we were usually the first picked-up from a string of hotels and best of all - the first to be dropped off! Location was great for us even with the populations of the Hilton Hawaiian Village next door. The beach can be walked right down to the thick of things with the busy Waikiki beaches. I think we came upon three board walks with waves splashing up at times and one beach area between boardwalks that had to be carefully timed or get all wet during high tide. Go left from the front of the hotel to cross the street at the corner to catch TheBus #42 and take it to the Stadium every Wed, Sat and Sun for a flea market. Or, stay on the hotel side of the road and take TheBus #42 or #19 to get to Waikiki beaches and shopping or as previously mentioned to the Food Pantry, We even used the #42 from across the street to get us down to Chinatown and some pier viewing harbour-front and down by the Aloha Tower before getting a return trip on the #19 with our transfer - cost - $2.50 each. I think it was TheBus #20 that got us up to a top near Diamond Head Crator. We walked the hike up and only just to after the tunnel; took a few pics of the switch backs up and turned around. We were actually unprepared wearing only sandals - not appropriate for a good hike. Coming down to the bottom of the hill you too can take pics of the Blue Stop sign?? Don't ask us but we took pics of it anyhow. We ended up walking all the way down following the bus route which got us down to the edge of Waikii Beach and where we found LuLu's. THAT was do-able in sandals! If you get the chance we recommend the Circle tour of Oahu - you might want to update your plans and do some further-reaching exploring after that informative enjoyable tour.

The coffee shop on the main level is ok. Nothing to write home about, but for coffee, just fine (skip the pastry). The only real negative I have about the Ilikai is their lax smoking policy. We were told it's a completely non-smoking hotel and grounds. Every single time we sit on the balcony, the man in the unit below us is smoking. Every time we leave from the front, someone is smoking right by the valet. Every time we walk by the pool, someone is smoking.

The Ilikai is close to a marina and the big lagoon. The beach is visible from the hotel, but a short walk. The Ala Moana mall is fairly close too, and in walking distance. I've stayed twice now. The first time I had a massive contemporary hotel room with balcony overlooking the lagoon and ocean. You can watch fireworks on Friday nights from your balcony. The last time I visited, our room was smaller, and overlooked the marina. I'm thinking the room was actually a condo ... There was a cute, modern kitchen with granite countertops. The bathroom was smaller, but came with a high - tech toilet. The room had a nice layout with a bed, couch , and dining table. The hotel itself is dated on the outside. The pool is not fancy. There are bus stops right out front of the lobby. I think this building is part hotel, part condo, and part time-share. You really see a variety of people staying here. There is a laundry room on every other floor. The quality of the machines is so-so. The dryers get super hot, and ruined a couple articles of my clothing.

As it turned out, The Ilikai was an excellent choice for our 8 day stay.The location of The Ilikai was ideal. You have easy access to the lagoon and beach on one side of the building without having to cross any roads. We had a couple of surfers in our group who hired boards for the week and it was really quick and easy for them to carry their boards from the hotel out to the break in front of the hotel. Likewise, our snorkellers in the group photographed turtles just off the shore.The Ilikai is ideally located too for transportation. We hired cars from Alamo straight across the road for a few days, we had also arranged tours to take us up to the North Shore during the surf comps and the hotel's location provided excellent access to be picked up and dropped off by our Driver. We all walked down to Ala Moana shopping centre easily and you have bus stops just outside the hotel on both sides of the road which is a bonus to take you anywhere around Waikiki.Cinnamons Restaurant was really nice, and for my 3 weeks of staying in Hawaii, they made the best cocktails I tasted on my trip. (Especially the Mai Tai)The hotel grounds were beautifully maintained and although there was a bit of construction going on, it didn't impact on us negatively. We all had different views from our rooms, our family loved our high level 2 bedroom Marina view and would request that position again.

My husband had questioned any renovation, work etc., prior to booking. So disappointed in this decision. My daughter/Husband had a BRBO and we had a hotel rental, both of which we were pleased. Loved having the lagoon, pool except for the 2 days and beach to pick from. The beach though closest to hotel is almost impossible to walk on both on the sand and in the water. I have never felt such sharp rocks on any prior beach trips. I have been on many. Maybe because it's used by the public??? On down it's good though. Our trip did not end well though. My husband left one of my bags at the desk. We noted this after getting lost trying to find United departure, so lost time as we toured your great city one more time.

The hotel was in very good shape for the age of it. We did stay in an updated luxury room which maybe made the difference. My only complaint was that we paid the extra money for the mountain view room and it wasn't worth the extra money. Yes, you could see a glimpse of the mountains but the flip side is that the rooms face the VERY noisy street. We could not enjoy our balcony at all because it was simply too noisy to sit outside. At night we slept with a sound machine on to drown out the noise of the traffic which allowed us to sleep but if you are a light sleeper be careful of booking this side of the hotel. We did not complain about it as we spent a lot of time away from the room and as noted, we were able to sleep so we stayed. Because of that I can't comment on if they hotel would have been accommodating with moving us.

Ask for one of the remodeled units. There are also units available direct from owners (on vrbo and the like) but we went straight with the hotel so we could have housekeeping and a renovated room. The lower floors have not yet been renovated so ask for a higher floor. The kitchen was super nice: granite counters, microwave/convection oven, etc. There is one set of washer/dryers on each floor. The view of the lagoon and the ocean was lovely from the lanai. The location is perfect: a short walk or $5 cab ride from a small grocery store, next to Hilton village which has an urgent care in it (we used it unfortunately), next to the lagoon which has no waves for the little ones and the beach, about a mile from main Waikiki Beach area and major shopping centers. There is a bus stop out front, convenience store in the building, and DVD rentals. The pool is nice, although not huge or fancy like the resort next door. The toiletries in the room was actually the nicest surprise for me! Paul Mitchell Awapuhi keratin conditioner rinse- why is this a big deal? It made washing sand out of and detangling kids hair easy after a day at the beach. Housekeepers were all so nice- really all of the employees were helpful. They leave you Honolulu shortbread cookies in the room when you arrive (so delicious I bought more when out shopping). All in all a nice stay. Things to note: there are only two chairs on the lanai and no chairs that can really be dragged out there from the room and the knives in the kitchen are dull (cutting up a pineapple was very very difficult) so bring one from home.","Worcester, Massachusetts","LeahN60</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Worcester, Massachusetts</strong>",1,4.0

My room obviously was not one of the updated modern ones with new marble kitchen counter and refrigerator. Also, I noticed that my sheets had not been changed during the four nights I stayed there. I don't know if this is something that needs to be requested to the housekeeper.Staying at the Ilikai is very convenient as most tours pick-up at this hotel and it is by Waikiki Beach. But given the location and price, all rooms need to be updated. Guests should not be given old rooms based on bad luck of the draw or at the receptionist's choice because that person is single or got a good deal on a website.

We loved it. Only 4 or 5 of the top floors are run by the hotel, these are listed as the Luxury rooms. The rest of the place is time shares and condos. I believe the hotel manages some of the time shares and condos for people, so do not book anything but the luxury rooms or who knows what you'll end up with. The hotel rooms are remodeled nicely, have full kitchens, and the windows and sliding glass doors are floor to ceiling, which makes for some amazing views!!! Everyone at this hotel was really nice from start to finish, which in Waikiki isn't always the case. We booked a ocean view room & when we got there were upgraded to an ocean sunset room, which was really nice! Views, views, views. We looked out onto the harbor and ocean beyond. We saw some amazing sunsets on our rather large balcony. Maid service was very good, she even cleaned the top rails on the balcony daily. At first I was worried about the location since its on one end of Waikiki, but it was actually perfect. It's literally right next door to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, where the craziness of Waikiki really begins. After spending 5 days in Waikiki we were so thankful to be staying on the end of it instead of in the middle of it. Waikiki is like Vegas, without the gambling, tons of people, cars, stores, food, lots of hustle n bustle. It was so nice to come back to the hotel and feel like you were in s relaxing place, even though you were just next door to the chaos. Often we hung out in the open lobby in the evening or courtyard looking at the harbor relaxing. The store they had inside the hotel was actually cheaper than the 10 plus surrounding abc stores. Cinnamon's was great for breakfast & Sarento's on the top floor had amazing views & great food, expensive, but great for a date night of fine dining at its best. The pool is nothing to write home about, but we just literally walked right next door to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and used their pools. The lagoon was also nice & the beach is right there. We walked the entire Waikiki strip several afternoons & evenings, you are close to everything. We also walked to the Ala Moana shopping center 2 blocks down, that place is insane over 300 stores, a bit much for me to take in. I highly recommend this place, it will now be my go to for Waikiki.

The view was of Ala Moana Blvd and the surrounding mountains. The suite itself was spacious although not really a suite. it did have a living area and a full kitchen with a breakfast bar. full size fridge and a real stove and oven. Pots pans utensils and dishes were provided. The bed, while a bit stiff for me, was comfortable and clean. Bathroom was also spacious but it was a bit awkward getting past the commode into the shower. pretty much impossible if your spouse was sitting down at the moment. Not a big deal.Parking is by Valet only but there are no call downs I just told them when I was going to need my car the next time when I dropped it and it was usually in the ""ready"" parking when I came to get it. Check in was exactly as expected, I would have preferred expedited check out where they slip your bill under the door in the wee hours and off you go. The beach bar was nice and the music not to loud but it was definitely a production bar and not all that laid back. One other thing I did not like was to get your luggage into the hotel by yourself you had to go out of the way to a luggage elevator. No ""let me take that for you"". but a stern ""NO"" when you approach the stairs or escalator. followed by directions to the elevator.","Alsea, Oregon","TomAlseaOR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alsea, Oregon</strong>",36,4.0

The location is good for cruise ships, for being next to the lagoon which has tons of fun crafts to rent for kids/teens, and for viewing the fireworks. The price was excellent and they offer a lot of promotions so keep a look out before you book. Issues however were: 1. our room was too close to the elevator and we could hear dings and loud talking in the hall so make sure you request a room at least several rooms from the elevator. 2. beware of what ocean view actually means. our ocean view room meant that if you were in the room and looked out all you saw were buildings. however, if you went out to the deck and sat to the very far left side or leaned out over the balcony you could see the water. i would call it a partial ocean view at best. if you want to look directly out to the water you need to specify that and I would estimate only about half the ocean view rooms do, the other half are on the sides of the building facing other buildings. 3. the first morning there was an overwhelming septic smell on the lobby level, so bad we couldn't eat at the restaurant for breakfast. no one could explain it other than someone offered up maybe it was low tide at the lagoon-- but I live near the ocean and it smelled more like sewerage to me. 4.

The location is perfect, situated around any and everything you can think of from the beach to the shopping malls to car rentals and marines. My husband and I stayed at Ilikai hotel for one week celebrating his 50th birthday it was the most relaxing and refreshing week. We were in room 2580 great ocean view, the whole outlook of the hotel was not your Hilton but inside was clean, breezy and beautiful. There were shops inside on the main floor everything you think you might have left at home was right at your footsteps, things were expensive but it was worth it after all it was like a convenience for all your needs. Our room had a king size bed and kitchenette very, very clean, the view was awesome and our house maid was very pleasant her name is Fannie. We were just under the penthouse floor and at the top of the building there was a restaurant Sarentos which we dined at for my hubs birthday beautiful view of the ocean and buildings an amazing sunset. There is a 24 hour service restaurant where you could get breakfast, lunch and dinner Wailana breakfast cost us $30 but it was very filling, that was steps away from the hotel and close to Hilton Hawaiian as well. The other places around was Goofy they also had a healthy breakfast which was around $32 but it was also worth the money, that meal would take you to almost close to dinner time. There were a lot of ABC stores around so if you ran out of anything it was not a problem to get it, as well the mall was within walking distance about 15 mins or so but it was a nice walk. There was also a McDonalds and Buffalo Wings but I didn't enjoy the buffalo wings so will not recommend, Red Lobster also. Sun was out but it was breezy so the walk was fun. Did 3 tours but I will not recommend the Atlantis tour unless you have never been in a submarine and would like the experience otherwise don't waste your money and its a lot cheaper to book the Atlantis tour on the beach as oppose to booking when you go to the breakfast orientation...... Paradise Cove tour was awesome it included some games and shows and a luau, people were so friendly and our tour guide on this one was cousin Flo she was AWESOME!!! We also had a Dinner cruise which included some fireworks as it was the new year eve of Hawaii I think, sorry can't remember, that was a private dinner and a free photo of you on the cruise it was the best!!!!! We also rented a car and drove to Pearl Harbor but just cruising at night not to visit also drove around sight seeing and it was beautiful. I think 5 days is too short I wish we could have stayed longer but we are definitely planning another trip but to Maui and with the whole family. The man made beach we didn't go too but the public beach we did and the water was great, sun was scorching but it felt awesome just relaxing and enjoying the scenery. There was also a $15 fee per day for the resort which I believe included the wifi and other ammenities as well if you rent a car you pay $30 or 35 per night at the hotel but a block from the hotel you can park overnight for $20 for 24 hrs.","Toronto, Canada","784karenp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",8,5.0

We were all very pleased with our accommodation. I know this was built in the late 60s and was one of the first high rise hotels. It has beautiful gardens, an easy going atmosphere, a really great souvenir, grocery shop underneath, even the clothes shop was rather nice, although the items can be found cheaper elsewhere, it was reasonable.My room was huge with huge bed, light and bright with a great roomy bathroom and a view of the mountain, which means a cross section of the busy streets from up high, so noise wasn't a problem, and also spectacular to me. An older style kitchen, but everything was there. Lovely Hawaiian touches, classy lamps and bed covers. Service was excellent, cleanliness too. Truly charming and rather ""old world rock star"". Well, this is where the stars stayed and Jack Lord twirled on top for Hawaii 5-0 opening sequence. I loved it!There is a lift to the top floor that goes to a restaurant/piano bar where the views are 360, wow! A kind of rustic Italian restaurant, very traditional and somehow historical, I like it a lot. An amazing bar, service and atmosphere capturing a time gone by, but in a very glamorous way.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","Pauline B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",6,5.0

Our room looked out on to the street, we loved sitting on the balcony in the warm air late in the evening people watching. There was a laundry on our floor and a trash area ( I think they are on every floor). The lifts were very fast. The location was absolutely perfect, only minutes walk to the beach where you can snorkel in thigh deep water (perfect for the younger ones) and see marine life such as pretty fish and turtles. There are shops in the complex and a market for all your needs. If you have smaller children the hotel backs on to a man made lagoon which is beautiful. It has paddle boats and boards to hire aswell.

My flight into HNL arrived in the morning therefore only expected to check in after 12pm so we decided to leave our luggages at the front desk. Upon checking in, surprisingly we received our room key (that was around 9ish) (and maybe it is a weekday in which rooms were not fully occupied). I was not impressed with the front desk staff as she did not smile at all but check in was done quickly. Love the room's interior - modern and new although that the building exterior isn't that impressive. I wasn't looking for a typical hawaiian looking hotel nor hotels located near to the busy waikiki beach therefore Ilikai Hotel was a good choice. Near to Ala Moana Shopping Mall - about 10 mins walk though. My room is on the 23 floor, ice dispenser and washing machine available at lift lobby. PS3 gaming station is also available in the room but only a set of controller. We did request for one more but was informed that only controller per room. Videos and games are available for rental at the machine on ground floor. Shops available too, if you do need to get your necessities. Since we were too tired from our flight, we got some items to eat from the shop since there isn't any in - room dining available. Swimming pool at the hotel is small so don't expect much about it. My room is facing the lagoon and Hilton's, and envy the atmosphere that they provided for their customers with activities and events. However, in Ilikai, it is just quiet. It is still quite a walk to the nearest beach, and to the busy street of waikiki but we did get around. Do take a bus to get you around if you dislike walking a lot.

I got an ocean view room, and it was well worth the upgrade to wake up and see the beach from our balcony, located on a higher floor. The rooms have a very ""home"" feel, and it makes you forget you're even in an hotel room. The kitchen is the major pro, since eating out for every meal can get expensive. This hotel also isn't a resort, so I'm a little wary about why you have to pay a ""resort fee"". It's not as steep of a fee as other hotels in the area, and is pretty reasonable. The worst part of the hotel had to be the gym, which needs major updating on all of its equipment. The treadmill and elliptical were very old, and rusted which was kind of gross.

There’s also the other side w/ a harbor view. I, my mother and grandmother stayed in a private condo which was okay. The front entrance and lobby always seemed busy but once inside, in the garden, or the pool it was peaceful. Although the city noise was ever present, but it’s Waikiki after all. The pool was heated, moderately sized and a pool attendant was nearby for towel service. Avoid the chairs closest to the beach because the designated smoker area is on the path behind the bushes. As of February 2016 they are building an additional pool area. There are plenty of shops in the lobby everything from souvenirs and groceries to wedding planning and photography. There was live music and hula dancing in the garden to enjoy and the 2 min fireworks show on the beach every Friday put on by the next door Hilton Hotel. We ate breakfast and dinner once each at Cinnamon’s next to the garden. They serve diner like food and it was tasty. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and within walking distance. There is an ABC store right next to the hotel for simple grocery items. Check out The Cheeseburger Waikiki restaurant, a 7 min walk for casual dining and delicious burgers. Be prepared for heavy pedestrian tourist traffic. For parking we utilized the valet service $$ so we didn't have to worry about that and they were always prompt.Overall the Ilikai was a pleasant hotel/condo experience in the bustling Waikiki.

The gift shop was also neat, clean and well stocked and I enjoyed chatting with the friendly clerks. Their swimming pool was small but well kept; pool staff were friendly and helpful and showers were very clean and fresh.

The water is peaceful enough that my 13 and 9 yr old niece and nephew could enjoy it without worrying about rough conditions, altho as always, they did have adult supervision. It wasn't too crowded and the view, whether looking east to Diamond Head, or west towards the sunset, was amazing. Valet staff was exceptional; everyone was always professional, polite and helpful if we needed abit of directions and they were always prompt, even during busy times of day.

At first glance we were very disappointed. We saw stains in the carpet and rips in the furniture.The chaise lounge and couch, besides being ripped have lost most of the foam and now are very lumpy and need lots of pillows to sit on, so you won't feel the large springs. The taps in the bathroom are rusty and I tried cleaning, but the rust is there to stay. The owner said he slept on the couch and it was passable but no luxury, and explained that the Ilikai is not a high end resort and priced as such. The owner did say that the rips have been fixed, but I feel replacement should be the only option. We had company over (they were also in a room at the Ilikai) and they could not sit on the lounge chair, very uncomfortable, certainly not like their upgraded room. The appliances have seen better days, but work well, a shelf in the freezer would be great.The hotel has a very small pool, but the towels are plentiful.The location and views are great, wonderful area for walking and not too busy.

If so, read on. You know the deal: you are a long way from home, Honolulu really isn’t such a nice place, and you are facing a soul-sucking schmoozathon with professional strangers for hours on end.

Those all take the sting out, right? Well, here’s the deal: this hotel bats about .300. OK for the majors, less good for a hotel. Here’s what you will experience: you pull up to a massive building, circa 1965, built in the style that I can only describe as Cinderblock Revival, with Tiki Torches. Checking in, the desk person is friendly, barely, as she walks you through all the stuff you get for the mandatory “amenities fee” that will be larded onto your bill, including a $50 “credit” for dining at their not so lovely restaurant. Use it or lose it. And in case your meeting starts early, forget it, the restaurant opens at 7AM. What’s to like? The rooms are remodeled and actually rather nice.

It is a great location for avoiding the major downtown Waikiki traffic.. Yet, it is also a short walk or bus/car ride to Ala Moana shopping centre, downtown Honolulu. 2) The entire building itself is very clean and they are in the process of upgrading the hotel and apartments are privately owned. Most have gone through extensive renovations and modernization. 3) The restaurant Cinnamons downstairs is fantastic for breakfast (we did not try lunch or dinner). The price was comparable to a highly recommended local spot (Diamond Head Take Out- which you have to try on your way to or from your hike). Portions were very generous. 4) All the employees were pleasant and helpful (even in the midst of the chaos of the Honolulu Marathon where entire Waikiki is shut down! 5) Pick a room that has a lagoon view so you can be in direct view of the Friday Night fireworks show! It is spectacular! If not, try and get reservations at Shorebirds (which is walking distance too) or beach front restaurant for dinner. Fireworks begin at 7pm. 6) Ditto on the previous post re: parking. It is very convenient. Cons: Not much about the hotel itself, but because condos privately owned, it is hit and miss.. I made the mistake of booking the room one less night and just realized this prior to leaving. Fortunately the management staff was able to get me a room just across from ours-- what a drastic difference! Ours was original--- I MEAN ORIGINAL! Nothing was upgraded, not even the bathroom sink- it was 70s style. And our floor was not upgraded yet (as mentioned, the entire building is getting a facelift). So as such, the carpeting in the halls were disgusting and some hotel room doors looked dirty. This is the reason why I have to rate the rooms as ""poor""-- but just do your research and ask what has been remodelled because the pictures can be deceiving. There was also a room on our floor that was constantly cooking something (yes it smelled good) but totally not what you want to smell when you come into a ""hotel"". Because units are privately owned, you have to get out of the mentality that it is a ""hotel"" and many live there permanently. We didn't get too much noise from where we were 5th floor corner unit overlooking marina and lagoon. Finally, when we got there, I didn't expect to find no toiletries-- again not sure if this was an oversight or if it is the decision of each private owner. There was a kitchen but no sense in using if you don't have any dish soap!","Toronto, Canada","alohakoa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",38,3.0

There are SO many stores & restaurants near by. You can see the Fri night fireworks show from the walk way behind the hotel, overlooking the marina. I would definitely stay there again!Cons: I really have no complaints about the hotel. However, on the city side, you can't really leave the lanai doors open unless you don't mind constant traffic noise. Parking is Valet only at $28/night. There is a public parking garage across the street (above the Red Lobster) that has in/out privileges for $20/night get a receipt if possible & be aware of following the directions, if your ticket doesn't work they will try to get $20 each time you enter! Also strictly follow the parking notices in the back around the marina & the Hilton pond. Tow trucks are there at 10:30 pm & will tow your car IMMEDIATELY.

For the past fourteen years, while visiting her parents once or twice a year, we have invariably stayed at the Waikiki Prince Hotel located a little more than a block away from the Ilikai. All the rooms at the Prince are ocean front, the hotel is clean and well managed, and the room rates are very reasonable by Waikiki standards. What’s wrong with the Prince is that in all those fourteen years, the rooms have never been refreshed. What was once high end and modern, has gradually become tired, worn, and dated. The Ilikai celebrated its 50’th anniversary in 2014. For a hotel, a fiftieth anniversary can be a good thing or a bad thing. If you’re old enough, the Ilikai’s exterior façade, with its continuous, wrap-around, balconies, sliding patio doors, and turquoise decorative panels, will take you back to the heyday of sixties, high-rise, hotel-apartment, architectural design. The same can be said for the Ilikai’s lobby. In the nineties, my in-laws spent a month or two at the Ilikai every winter. Only thirty-something years old at that point, the Ilikai was already showing its age. The rooms were tired, worn, and dated. At the time, I would have characterized them as ‘tacky’.This past November, on the recommendation of a family friend who reported that, under new management, the Ilikai had undergone a major renovation and face-lift, and based on what appeared to be, a very competitive room rate, my wife and I decided to give the Ilikai a try, and we were certainly glad that we did.The public spaces will not impress, but then, the same can be said of ninety percent of Waikiki’s hotels. The reason to stay at the Ilikai, and what makes the Ilikai an exceptional value, are the rooms on upper floors 22 through 25. By urban, downtown, hotel standards, the rooms are large and spacious; suite-like. The rooms have full kitchens with full-sized appliances and granite counters and breakfast bars. The kitchens are open to the rest of the room making them bright and full of light. The bathrooms are large and modern with marble floors and granite vanity tops. There’s no tub, but the shower is spacious, made to feel all the more spacious for the lack of a shower door. The living space is, more or less, equally apportioned into two areas; a ‘living room’ with a couch and arm chairs and credenza and flat screen television, and a ‘bedroom’ comfortably accommodating a king-sized bed and night stands. No part of the overall room feels crowded or cramped. Again, spacious. And all of the furnishings work together. All the furnishings are new, high-end, and well-coordinated. Go look at the room photos. They’re representative and accurate.One of the best things about the rooms is each room’s individual, stand-alone, HVAC unit, operable via a remote control. The unit is well sized and powerful. Whatever your individual preference, especially for sleeping, you can quickly and quietly achieve whatever temperature that suits you. And unlike so many subtropical hotel rooms, the Ilikai’s HVAC units dehumidify nicely. There’s not even a hint of mildew or mustiness in the conditioned air. I believe all rooms come with a full balcony. Ours faced the ocean; more accurately, the Ali Wai small boat harbor. Again, refer to the room photos; representative and accurate.And the Wi-fi was fast, 24/7. The hotel staff are uniformly friendly, helpful, and accommodating. Worthy of particular commendation is the valet parking staff. We did a lot of in and out. I doubt I ever had to wait more than a few minutes for my car, even at the busiest of times.And then having nothing to do with the hotel itself, the Ilikai’s location is worthy of note. Located on the north end of Waikiki, you avoid a lot of the noise, traffic, and congestion found at the heart of Waikiki proper. On our first trip to Honolulu in 1984, staying in an ocean view room on a high floor of the Waikiki Marriott, on my first morning in Hawaii, upon throwing open the room’s sliding patio door, I was greeted by the smell of the neighboring Burger King’s kitchen exhaust, some thirty floors below. You’ll get none of that at the Ilikai, especially if you stay on the ocean side. The Ilikai is a ten minute walk from the geographic center of Waikiki and Waikiki Beach, and in the other direction, a similar ten minute walk from the Ala Moana Mall, the epicenter of Honolulu shopping. Excellent location, rooms, and prices, making for an exceptional value. You won’t be disappointed.","Winnetka, Illinois","mark k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnetka, Illinois</strong>",24,5.0

However the rooms we were offered were vastly different. When I checked in I was offered a room on the third floor, which overlooked some construction works currently going on at the hotel. The room was ok, and perfectly serviceable, however the noise was very noticeable, and the decor sadly dated and drab. After making a complaint to the hotel, they kindly offered me a new room, this time on the 22nd floor, and in the newly refurbished rooms which are light-years ahead of the rest of the hotel. The location is fairly central, and the view from the rooms are brilliant. The hotel lacks any mid-range restaurant, with only two polar opposites available - an open air 'beach' bar offering light burgers and snacks (nothing that special), and a high end Italian restaurant at the top offering excellent views (didn't try it) I would recommend the hotel, but only for the upgraded rooms, sadly the difference between the two means that booking the cheapest rate can mean pot luck with what you get - my tip, pay the little bit extra to get the upgraded experience.","Oxford, United Kingdom","Jonnyclarkoxford</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxford, United Kingdom</strong>",13,4.0

It ended up being a great choice.The location is near ideal. I didn't really want to be in the middle of Waikiki, this is more on the edge of it, which means that while it's still a busy area, it's not quite as crazy as other areas can be.We ended up in a Luxury Ocean View Suite. We had booked a Mountain View, but they upgraded us on arrival. 23rd floor, beautiful view over the lagoon and we arrived on a Friday, so had a front row, balcony seat to the Hilton's fireworks display (which they do every Friday). It was spectacular and a nice way to begin our visit.No need to upload pictures, the pictures on the website are exactly what we found. We were in one of the renovated suites. While they aren't large, they are big enough for two people and quite comfortable. There is a small but full kitchen. Full-sized stove, refrigerator and microwave. The kitchen is stocked with the basics - pots/pans, dishes, glasses, cutlery, toaster, coffeemaker, cutting board, knives - so eating breakfast, and an occasional dinner, in was a breeze. There is a nice-sized grocery store just a few blocks away on Holbron.Bathroom is big with a walk-in shower. My only complaint is the lack of places to hang towels. One towel rod and one hook. But it's a small complaint!Big balcony and well shielded from your next door neighbors, so they feel private. We were concerned about the bed at first - it felt too firm. But no problems sleeping, so really can't complain.One of the nicest things we noticed is that the room was really well insulated from noise. We never heard anyone in the hall, next door or below or above us. Extremely quiet. There is a $15 per day ""resort"" fee. That includes the wifi, unlimited blu-ray DVD rentals and a daily paper (maybe it includes more that I missed). The wifi slowed down for us on occasion, but mostly worked just fine for surfing the internet and checking e-mail. I don't think it would have been fast enough to stream anything. The DVD offerings were good and a nice convenience.The restaurant on the lobby level, Cinnamon's, was fine if you wanted something close and straight forward.We would definitely book this place again.

The ladies downstairs in the office were very friendly and helpful.While its advertised as a hotel, its really a serviced apartment i guess. We found the arrangement a bit confusing as we were sure what you could ask for or not.For example you can ask for fresh towels/toilet paper daily but your room is only cleaned every 4 days.The cleanliness of the room was not great and the first set of towels they brought us were all stained. Overall i'd say they need to step it up when it comes to cleaning the kitchen and bathroom.We didnt have water views so i cant comment on that, we were facing the street which was nice at night actually as all the towers were lit.Tip:One thing to be aware of. The lady in the office does help plan activities for you which is great but sometimes you get offered a discount for attendance of a seminar.For example we were going on the waterfall tour and they gave us a discount of $40 per person to attend a 90 min seminar by their parent company. But what happens is the 90 minutes turns into 5 hours of your time while the real estate agents try and sell you property.Do not agree to attend the seminars, its a waste of your time, just pay the extra $ and free yourself!","Sydney, Australia","Farnaz A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",109,3.0

The Ilikai is a combo of privately owned rental properties and hotel rooms. Based on other reviews, the condo rental quality is specific to each unit, and as for the hotel, not all rooms have been upgraded. So if you want a room with modern amenities, you will want to spend a few extra bucks for the upgraded rooms. The ""Luxury Suites"" have kitchens, which was great to help keep food costs down, as food in Honolulu/Waikiki is expensive. I had a King bed, which was very comfortable. The kitchen had pretty much everything you would need to make basic meals, including a toaster and blender! Full-size fridge/freezer, more then enough space for extended stays, if necessary. The beach is about a 5-10 minute walk from the property. There is a market onsite that has a limited selection of food items, and an ABC store 3 minutes walk across the street. If you can, hit up one of the farmers markets for some amazing fresh produce.I ate a couple of meals at Cinnamon's onsite, I would highly recommend for breakfast/brunch, especially the pancakes.The hotel does charge a $15/day resort fee, which is the lowest I saw for any of the Waikiki hotels. You do get a daily beach towel, a nice one, and a beach chair, if you want it as part of the fee. Valet parking is about $30/day if you have a car. I rented a car from Advantage onsite for 2 days, which was very convenient and priced competitively.Overall, a nice property, good for couples, families, large groups, or solo.","Chicago, Illinois","DenverHawkGirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",9,4.0

Good size good views.I rate our stay a 4 as it was very good BUT it could of been better -read on. We spent most days in the center of waikiki beach tho ,which is far from the hotel . The hotel is far away from where action is. If we were to return we would look for a hotel on waikiki beach near moana surfrider or outrigger. These hotels are on the front line of ALL the action and you can just walk directly across the road from them for All the luxury boutique shopping saving you lots on taxi fares. Hire of surfboards umbrellas chairs is cheaper in the middle as opposed to ends of waikiki beach. For eg those tractor looking pedal boats at the lagoon of hawaiian village next to the ilikai are a whopping $60 US per hour not to mention the surfboard hire costs which is dearer too. By the way if you want surfboard umbrella chair hire there are very cheap rental shops like a rental shop called quality surf board hire which was $20 US for the full day for a surfboard and they threw in a set of wheels to take it to beach for free and you could have it till 8pm not 5pm like most.We found waikiki beach and the island of oahu to be a classy holiday destination. I suggest ,if it is to high a price a hotel with ocean views then consider spending less time on vacation to compensate without compromising the quality of your stay. Your better off not wanting to leave hawaii then you are dying to return home early.This is an honest appraisal of our family stay and i hope it helps you.

Our one bedroom Condo 1639 was perfect for us. Clean, and well stocked with the basics (e.g. kitchenware to use in the small kitchen, snorkeling equipment on the deck, laundry down the hall) so it was a perfect base from which to explore the Island with our rental car. Right on the beach, with 10,000 other people, but it was still nice. I had spent the previous 2 weeks at the Hilton Waikiki Village next door and while it was much more lavish it was much more expensive - bars, restaurants, everything was more expensive. By contrast the Ilikai was more spartan (any place would be compared to the Hilton) but very well maintained and beautiful. In fact I liked my Ilikai condo much better than my lower level Hilton room; our view from the 13th floor was excellent. $20/day parking stung a bit (across the street at the Red Lobster) but I got used to it. Very pleasant walking distance to the very expensive but impressive Waikiki shopping district. A friend of mine described Waikiki as ""Las Vegas on a beach"", which isn't too far off.

It was facing the Hilton and the Lagoon, and we loved it. There was a kitchen (stove, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, blender) and there was a washer/dryer available on each floor. Each condo is different and depends on who owns it, so I recommend to check the floor plan of the building and look for where you want to stay. From our condo, we were able to see the Friday fireworks in the Hilton and the luau, drinking Mai Tais and Pina Coladas in our lanai (balcony). The pool is small; however, I never saw it crowded (as I have seen other pools in the area). Because it is located in the very end of Waikiki, it is a 15-20 minutes walk to Duke's statue (and central Waikiki), but the beach in front of the hotel is super nice too. There is a Safeway almost a mile away, but the shop downstairs is well stocked and with very decent prices for Hawaii. Several restaurants are in the area, and the Ala Moana shopping center is nearby.

It was nicely appointed with a full size kitchen, massive king size bed, a lounge area, and the good thing is through booking via holiday rentals you get to pick the room you like, rather that just get checked in to whatever is available. Prices were better that way too. So you just arrive and go up to your room, dont need to check in, and you can come and go as you please. If you book this way, you dont get daily room service. On our side all the rooms with even numbers face the lagoon view, Hilton side, the odd numbers face towards the marina. which is fine I guess , but the lagoon view side is , in my opinion the way better view. On the marina side you will also get the afternoon sun blazing in on that side. Our side enjoyed morning sun, and when it gets really hot, it was in the shade. Our air con was noisy for first 2 days until we figured out how to adjust various settings,so had to sleep with ear plugs. That was the only down side, everything else suited us just fine.

It's not a fancy or trendy spot, but it is clean, comfortable and an affordable option in an ok location. Nothing really stands out about the property though and it doesn't excel in any one area. Obviously, there are areas where it could improve, but overall, its a solid property. I stayed in a Luxury Mountain View room which featured a sitting area and a full kitchen. While I would hardly call it mountain viewing, the room was a nice size and I appreciated having a kitchen, although I imagine many will not care about that feature. The room also featured a balcony which was slightly marred by the fact that it also had a big exhaust unit on it (from the AC?) which blew air on me if I got in its half. Additionally, given the layout of the hotel and me being in an 01 room, from my balcony I could see into many other rooms on my floor (and they could see into my room). Didn't really appreciate that. There are some other minor critiques such as the placement of the toilet right in front of the shower entrance or the size of the TV given the distance from the bed. The theme here is solid, but nothing special. The location is good - just a short walk to the main beach areas and also to the Ala Moana shopping. Not super close to either one, but another area where the hotel is good, but not great.In general, the service was pretty good, but check in was extraordinarily slow. I had to wait over 10 minutes while they checked in the two people in front of me, because they explain all the little extra fees and whatnot. $28 for parking, $15 resort fee (for basically nothing) etc. While I ordinarily ding any property with those types of fees, unfortunately, this is par for the course in Hawaii. Another weak spot was bell service as it just seems understaffed. For a property with this many rooms to have 1 person on duty for large stretches of the day seems a bit odd.The pool area is small and very plain - it's definitely not an attraction. The hotels nearby had much more exciting designs and layouts. There are shops, restaurants and convenience stores on the main level which many took advantage of.Ultimately, its a value game. The Illikai is fairly priced for what it is - a solid property, but certainly not to be confused with a luxury or 4 or 5 star locale.",NY,"BaronDon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NY</strong>",32,4.0

The views were to die for, location was ideal and couldn't fault the hotel itself.

The mall is approximately one mile away. If you book a modern room, there is no dishwasher. Our room was clean and the hotel was remarkable quiet despite its size. The terraces are large and with an ocean front room, you can view the nightly entertainment at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort. There was only one washer and one dryer on our floor (23rd). Customer service was good. The $15 resort fee seemed worthless as there were hardly any beach chairs available to rent. I suggest renting a car however for a compact car rental is approx. $100/day. Parking is $28/day at hotel but there is public parking behind the hotel in Lot A and the cost is $1/hr. The beach is very rocky behind the Illikai hotel but becomes less rocky when walking towards the Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort. The sand is also very rough and course-- not soft sand you may find on other beaches. The trolley rides are good to take around the Waikiki area; especially the Pink line. Expect crowds at the beach and lagoon. If you can rent a car, I would suggest doing so. There are far better beaches in the North and Eastern Shore areas and the views are spectacular! Everything is costly; even fast food restaurants so be prepared to spends far more in food and entertainment than you ever would on the main land. One last tip unrelated to hotel, if you plan to visit Pearl Harbor, get there when it opens. Slots for entry fill very quickly.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Cindee F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",9,4.0

Our balcony overlooked the Hilton lagoon, which was such a soothing and bucolic view to awake to each morning.For that particular condo, I would recommend adding additional seating on the balcony.Softer, cushy chairs would be a lot more comfortable than the two straight back chairs that are around the small table. Also, for some reason the TV remote did not work in the unit, which was annoying.The building is centrally located so you can walk to everything. It also has valet parking (for a hefty price) and internal shops for your convenience. The small grocery store sells milk, bread eggs and other staples.

The kitchen is fully equipped with all the necessities, we even had a blender which we made good use of.In terms of location, the hotel is on the first stop if you are taking the airport shuttle to get to Waikiki. The bus stop to go to the other parts of Waikiki is just outside the hotel. It is also close to the Hilton lagoon, just a few minutes walk, and therefore easy to go and walk the firework on Friday nights. Options of eating out is limited to the hotel, McDonald, Indian restaurant and a few other places. You have to take the pink line (trolley bus) to get to the much lively part of Waikiki, and also the best part of Waikiki beach. Having said that it is easily to go to Ala Moana Centre (shopping centre) from Illikai, as it is possible to walk (around 15 mins walking...at least for me..). You can also take the pink like to go, and that is only one stop away.Usually the room is well stocked with towels and amenities, but the downside of staying at Illikai was the room is cleaned every 3 or 4 days. Considering the amount charged per day, the room should be cleaned much more frequently.We had to run around to get additional toiletries every 3 days.There is also a grocery shop on the premises, this was much appreciated to stock up on any necessities. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.We had free wifi the entire stay, and we loved that.We enjoyed our 7 days stay at Illikai, with the exception of the 3-4 day cleaning service. We believe this should be reviewed as it is a gret feeling to walk into your room and your bed is made and your bathroom is well stocked, without to run around to get soap!!!

Not only you got to see the fireworks every Friday night but you get free viewing when Hilton has its dance show at its building top. I think there is a show once every other days at the very least. We almost rent a car and we were glad we did't. The whole island runs on an award winning bus system and you can get to almost all attraction using the bus system with the stops just outside of the hotel's door. You can download apps ( i can't remember they are call at the moment) and it even tells you when the buses will arrive and what the connecting buses will be. It's $2.5 for adult and $1 (?) for kids 6 and up. There is no need to pay $15 to get to most of the attractions. If you only are going to stay at a place briefly, you can even use the transfer paper strips to return to go somewhere else. Just make sure you ask the driver for it. As for food, there is a full size kitchen. Yes, grocesary was expensive. $3 for 6 eggs at the ABC store. But there are a couple of larger supermaket near by walking distance. But if you are willing to cook, you are still saving tons of money eating in. Either way, the options are yours. Beach is across the street (more like a bridge). Not the finest sand but it's a beach. You do have to travel to the east or north side of the island for the finner sand.

We booked apartment #2021 through Waikiki Beach Rentals and in our experience it was very easy and great value for money. Not having to do a hotel check in and having a code to access the room (instead of a key) was fantastic.The room, although called a 1 bedroom apartment, was really a bigger hotel room but with a great kitchen. It was clean, well equipped and in a good location. There are 6 lifts, so unlike other hotels I have stayed in getting in and out was not an issue. I read reviews about the pool, but we never used it - why use a pool when there is a lagoon and beach at your doorstep? That said, it looked the same size as every other hotel pool in Waikiki and there were always pool chairs available if we did want to go there.Back to the room - the kitchen was modern and practical with a big fridge. The bathroom was fine and we had beach towels and bathroom towels. There was also a lot of storage space for your toiletries.Room wi-fi was brilliant.The king size bed was massive and the kids (7yo and 2.5yo) slept on the futon. The wardrobe was also massive with lots of hanging space and clothes hangers.The balcony was great and had an awesome 'egg chair' that we all loved lying in and watching the traffic go by.Each floor has a laundry that you can use for $2.50 per load.We used the valet parking - even though I read it was more expensive - as for the daily price you could come and go as much as you wanted and they were quick and it was easy.The location was great - beach and lagoon at your doorstep and close to shops, food, etc.If there is anything missing in the apartment I would say that I would have liked a window that we could leave open at night for fresh air, as I was not comfortable leaving the sliding door open. The only other thing we would have liked was a clothes airer for the beach towels and clothes that I did not want to out in the dryer.The cinammons restaurant downstairs was very good and we went there multiple times for breakfast and dinner.From the Ilikai it was an easy walk to Ala Moana Shopping Centre and into the busier part of Waikiki and the Pink Trolley ($2 fair each trip) was directly out the front of the hotel. The abc diagonally across from the Ilikai stocked the best selection of fresh fruit and vegetables than I saw in most other abcs.Next time we come back I will definitely stay here again.","Newcastle, Australia","natashac860</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle, Australia</strong>",30,5.0

The room/apartment was wonderful, with every convenience required to live as a home. Excellent cooking facilities and utensils, I would prefer to be able to purchase fresh produce for some home cooking, I am not particularly keen on American restaurant food in general, but their supermarket fresh options are superb, so having the ability to home cook in Hawaii would suit us . Not to mention the savings to both wallet & waist!!I read some reviews which say the rooms are a bit dated. This was definitely not the case with our room, everything in it seemed to be new, so perhaps a request for an updated room would be the way to go for a more extended stay.The Ilikai is very well located, a 5 min walk to the AloMoana shopping centre, on the beach, closest hotel practically to the airport and the Cruise harbour, and yet almost in the heart of ALL the action.

Those days are now long gone but this is a nonetheless charming place to stay for the right person. The property, as mentioned by others, is dated but still retains an old-fashioned, breezy, open-air feel. If you long for a gorgeous modern pool, this property is not for you (but the somewhat oddly attached ""Modern"" might be-- their pool is lovely). The pool here is small and filled with kids and surrounded by cinder blocks painted blue. But what the heck are you doing going to the POOL in HAWAII?? The property is an easy 15 minute walk to Ala Moana Beach Park (and Magic Island, an additional 5 minutes walk)-- the best swimming beach on Oahu. If you must go to Waikiki Beach, the ""Lagoon"" and Duke Kahanamoku Beach are about 10 minutes away walking down the incline in the back. Although I love renting individual properties (which you can do since there is a condo component to the hotel), I decided not to take any chances and we stayed in the luxury suites-- a 'sunset beach view' room. It was spectacular. From our 22nd floor perch, we could see the boat marina and the turquoise and blue waters of the Pacific beyond from every point in the room. There is a sizeable lanai with a table and 2 chairs for evening cocktails and morning coffee and Hawaiian sweetbread before a morning swim. The room looked newly refurbished and was clean and well kept up by friendly hotel maids. The mattress was fine and the air conditioning was ample, important in frequently hot and humid Hawaii. The kitchen was well-equipped, and although we enjoyed several restaurant splurges, we also used it for re-heating left-overs and making coffee and breakfast. The full size refrigerator held our water, sodas, and beer. There were plenty of utensils, cups, glasses, plates, and pots/pans for 2 people. The hotel also included a tiny dishwashing soap bottle, paper towels, and 2 large bottles of water. Also, a box of gourmet cookies! While the room would've been great without any further amenities or services, we also took advantage of free beach towels (that you can exchange for fresh ones at any time), a rental car service inside the lobby that turned out to be the cheapest of any that we looked at, as well as a coupon for 1 free DVD rental. We didn't use beach chairs but those were free too. The wi-fi was also free and was fast and reliable. A local newspaper is delivered daily. There is a standard over-priced hotel shop but ABC discount store is just across the street. Added to that, there is a conch blowing and torch lighting ceremony nightly and fireworks on Friday night. No room service but you can buy all manner of Asian and local goodies at Ala Moana up the street, bring them home, and heat in the microwave (and eat on the lanai with an ocean view!) so who needs room service? There is also a coffee shop type place with an ocean view, which we didn't go to and a fancy Italian restaurant on the top of the hotel. Although we didn't eat there, we did have a sunset mai-tai on our last night. The view is spectacular. There is also a nice coffee/cappuccino place for the caffeine addicted. In short, this was the best valued and most beautiful room for the money that we've ever stayed in in Hawaii. Definitely a 5 star room and experience!",Boston,"drrusl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston</strong>",60,5.0

Myself (55) my wife (49) my daughter (18) and son (16). We had a king size bed, fold out couch and a ""roll-a-way"" bed in our room. Although a bit cramped together we enjoyed our stay. One thing that you need with teens is unlimited, in room wi-fi which is included with the 'hospitality fee' of $15.00 a day. The fee also covered gym use (which I will cover later) free beach towels and beach chair use, SO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS, don't get hosed renting these things at some distant beach. The room had a full kitchen and basic utensils so we went to Wal-mart and bought groceries to make breakfast and lunches. Food in Hawai'i is very expensive so every meal we ate in room saved us 40-50 dollars. The bathroom was a single basin, shower only deal with granite counters and lots of storage. We live in so. California where water is treated like a commodity, so having a full pressure shower was nice, but remember no matter what the forecast says it's ALWAYS raining some where on Oahu, all that water comes at the expense of being rained out for a while vacationing. The room it self was decent enough, a little worn but totally functional.  You have to remember the Ilikai was built as apartments originally, so you have to make some concessions to luxury. The pool is spartan, just a rounded rectangle with lounge chairs, the gym is large with 20 year old Paramount machines, 3 elliptical trainers (two out of order), two exercise bikes, one rowing cardio trainer with 3 mounted TV's. The gym is unattended and was basically completely empty when I worked out at 7 am every morning. We did not eat on the property restaurants so I have no idea about the quality of service or food in them. The front desk was accommodating and efficient. The Ilikai is the building Jack Lord was photographed on in the introduction of the old TV series ""Hawai'i 5-0"" that is celebrating it's 50 anniversary, so the front desk had Hawai'i 5-0 playing 24/7 on a TV behind the front desk, watching while waiting in line they obviously used the hotel for every single ""location"" shot as you will recognize tons of areas around the hotel!The lagoon right out front is a great place for renting paddle boards and pedal boats, very calm and relaxing. There is a board walk that extends toward Waikiki that is about 1/2 mile long, this is great morning walk, if you are so inclined. DO NOT rent anything from the beach rental place at the end of the board walk or use this beach! It has very sharp rocks and learning to paddle board over these things was like trying to stand up on a surf board over a bed of nails!Over all a great experience I would recommend the Ilikai for families on a budget wanting a good location and not worry about rowdy party animals around you all the time.","Chino Hills, California","LessCapable</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chino Hills, California</strong>",14,4.0

If you're looking for luxury, this is NOT the place for you. That being said ... it is one of the most affordable stays in Honolulu, and for the price, it's pretty impressive. LOCATION The location is AMAZING. It's located on the outter end of the resort strip near Hilton Hawaiian village. The beach in this area is not crowded at all. We were able to get chairs every day during our stay at various times during the day. You're also conveniently located next to Hilton Hawaiian Village, so you have quick access to their restaurants, bars, shops and activities, without the inflated cost of staying there! The lagoon right outside of the Ilikai is a great treat ... best of both worlds (pool and ocean). Never crowded, safe and relaxing. RESTAURANTS The restaurant was great for lunch (cinnamons is the name i believe?). However, our dinner experience was just odd. The service was off, and the menu was just strange. The food was okay, but again, I'd stick to this place for breakfast and lunch only. That being said, you are only steps away from Hilton Hawaiian Village and can easily take advantage of their restaurants and bars.

Everything was clean and inviting- from the beautiful waterfalls in the main entrance to the relaxing, open air, dining area and ‘patio’ seating that offers beautiful marina views. Every few nights (2x a week, I think?) there is a small traditional band and dance (Hula) show in the main patio and on Fridays you can see the fireworks from the Hilton Hawaiian next door.The pool area was standard- nothing to write home about, but clean and quiet and well kept with comfortable lounge chairs. My only wish is that they had a bar in the pool area or something more exciting. The beach is not quite *right* at the hotel but only a minute or two walk. This beach access, however, is ""on"" the Hilton Hawaiian property and while public to everyone, it seemed that the Hilton Hawaiian was more ‘family’ oriented so the beach area was overrun with small children. Also, this area was super rocky and the water much colder than the main Waikiki Beach area, so I did not enjoy the beach at this end of the island quite as much. I found it disappointing, but it did not necessarily take away anything from my vacation, but if your main concern during your stay is the beach, this is not the place for you.The casual dining restaurant on premise was mediocre but suitable. Their drinks were good at the bar and convenient. Service was always great, and it was nice for breakfast but I wish they would put a restaurant with more variety and/or more nightlife in. It just felt…lacking. The fancy restaurant at the top of the hotel is a must see as the views are phenomenal, but either just go for drinks (which are superb) or be prepared for the large expense.It is also worth noting that this hotel is located in the Marina area of the island, so this is not in downtown Waikiki where all the ""main"" action is. It's about 20 minutes to walk to Waikiki beach and shopping. However, we also found it far quieter with less crowds and bustle than the main Waikiki Beach and this suited us just fine. We stayed in a private condo at the Ilikai on the 7th floor (I want to say #707 but I have since lost the paperwork to be sure). For a 'condo' the room was not much bigger than a typical hotel room, although it did have a nice little kitchette area with full fridge, stove, dishes etc. and this made a big difference for us. The lovely lanai had a marina view which offered perfect viewings of the splendid Hawaiian sunsets every night. The beds and linens were great, although we had 3 of us staying in the room and found that it was not really adequate for that many people- definitely more of a 2-person condo if you don't want to feel cramped. They do have a futon but it was so soft we never ended up using it and instead 2 people just had to share a bed. That said, it was a small price to pay for the kitchen amenities, ocean view, and good prices we got. Also, the door lock system worked perfectly and we loved not needing to keep track of room keys. The booking process was super easy and convenient and I would recommend booking through Waikiki Beach Rentals again since overall, the price of the condo was a really good value for what we got.","Troy, New York","Joanna H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Troy, New York</strong>",42,4.0

Very nice lanai - the view of the mountains and Ala Moana activity was great. Beds were adequate comfort. Bathroom & kitchen had nice touches and very clean. The reason we'd not return to this specific condo ... there are only mini fridges so we had to buy ice everyday. One of them was not very cold. The sofa is more like a futon and so uncomfortable we hated sitting on it. But the biggest problem is the old fashioned in-window air conditioner. It barely cools the space and makes so much noise ... super annoying at night. We were lucky we had such trade winds that this trip to Honolulu was not so hot as usual as the air does not work.The door lock system worked perfectly - just as instructed. The booking process was super easy and convenient so I will use Waikiki Beach Rentals again and recommend. The price of the condo was a really good value.Overall this was a great vacation.

Overall, I think it's a good value for the area. We booked via the hotel's website with a AAA discount--this is important because some people end up booking condos at the Ilikai, and have expressed disappointment with the condos. Our hotel room on the 24th floor was lovely--updated furnishings, including a king bed, sitting area, and a kitchenette (stove, microwave, fridge, toaster, and coffeemaker and dishes/silverware for 4 people plus some basic pots & utensils). It was quiet--we never heard other people on our floor and the street noise wasn't too bad (kind of unavoidable in a city). The only real downside was that we were expecting a nice pool--the one at this hotel is very small. Technically the hotel isn't on Waikiki Beach (that's actually a couple of beaches down the way to the left if you're facing the ocean). Hotel guests can access a small man-made lagoon, and then the beach starts (again, to the left of the lagoon if you're facing the ocean). This part of the beach was somewhat crowded and the sand was pretty thin (we tried to put up a sunshade that has stakes, and about 2 inches below the sand was rock/concrete). Your better bet for the beach is to walk over to Ala Moana Beach Park, which is on the other side of the marina (to the right if you're facing the ocean). There you'll find a small protected area that's great for swimming (some rocks are piled up to create a wave-break so that the swimming area is calm), and further down, there is an even larger beach area.","Lexington, Kentucky","hknudsen_24</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lexington, Kentucky</strong>",15,4.0

Mountain view is actually street view with mountains betweenthe buildings. Ala Moana is very noisy, but thick windows kept out the noise at night.Staff very friendly. Friday night we ate at the outdoor restaurant (moderate prices) and were treated to a fabulous Hawaiian show of music, singing, hula dancing followed by the fireworks from Hilton Hawaiian Village. Disadvantage is a bit of a walk to Waikiki Beach 5 mins. or so (hotel is on a marina and next to Hilton's lagoon.) Advantage is not coping with the crowds.

It looks just as you see in the images - no surprises. It was very clean and well maintained. We really appreciated the wonderful service provided by the property managers and would not hesitate to rent again. The location is close to beach at the north end of the Waikiki area, right next door to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, loads of restaurants, shops and an easy walk to Ala Moana. Having the parking spot was great. The master bedroom has lovely views of the harbor and ocean, and the guest bedroom with two twins worked perfectly for our two young kids. The ac units work great and both ensuite bathrooms are fully upgraded (our kids loved the Toto toilets). It was quite windy one of the days/nights and the noise level was very reasonable. The sliding doors are a bit sticky to lock and unlock, but that was not bad for us since I knew the kids couldn't open them on their own! The only negative was that the kitchen lacked basics of Salt, Sugar, Oil and any spices. Not a big deal, but it would be nice not to have to buy those items (I sure hope they keep them for the next guest since we used so little of them). There are beach toys and chairs available as well. Overall a great property with fabulous views. We would highly recommend one particular restaurant: Chai's Waikiki just a block and a half down Ala Moana Blvd. Great staff and some of the best food for a casual meal. Also, if you have not eaten at Marukame Udon on Kuhio Ave, that is also a must. But get there early since there is always a line (they open at 11 for lunch).","Portland, Oregon","Mel T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",17,5.0

The room was spacious clean and well equipped with the most beautiful views of the lagoon and ocean. We sat on the large Lanai and watched the whales in the mornings just playing. The hotel is a beautiful original hotel. Very friendly staff who are more than happy to help even though we booked privately. Reggie at the tours/info desk was fantastic and gave us so much advice on the best tours suited to our family as well as places to eat etc. The pool is nice although the rules are a bit strict. The restaurant down stairs was nice especially on Friday nights with Hawaiian Ukulele and Hula dancers there. The café has the best coffee I found but closed a little early.

There was a large flat screen TV, a kitchen complete with even a rice cooker, a large balcony with comfortable chairs for enjoying the view of the Hilton Hawaiian Village lagoon and the ocean beyond, very comfortable beds and was spic and span. If you hate heights, as does my husband, do not stay up on the 20th floor. Also, one word of caution....if you stay on the side facing the Hilton Hawaiian Village, be prepared for lots of noise. All day long there were shrieks from kids in the large pool across the way. And there were lots of those annoying back-up beeps from vans and trucks across the way. One good thing about that side and our condo though is that you can watch the Hawaiian Village Luau entertainment nearly every night right from the balcony. Even better, however, is the free Hawaiian show right there in the courtyard of the Ilikai most nights. Fairly new is their restaurant overlooking the yacht harbor. It is a branch of an extremely popular restaurant elsewhere on the island, Cinnamons. Sitting outside in that warm balmy air enjoying cocktails and delicious reasonably priced food was wonderful. During Happy Hour drinks are just under $5, and there are many appetizers for $5 and $6. Also, from the Ilikai one can watch the Friday evening fireworks at the Hawaiian Village. The enormous Ala Moana Shopping Center with several good restaurants is within walking distance, and there are other good places to eat nearby. One huge plus is a large ABC store across the street that has not only souvenirs but a large grocery selection with fresh fruits and vegies, liquor, meats, milk and most any necessity you might have forgotten to bring. And for trips further than walking distance, Oahu has a fantastic bus system with a bus stop right in front of the Ilikai. Seniors ride anywhere for just $1. In fact, one Saturday we took the bus up to the college on the side of Diamond Head for their terrific Farmers Market. For just $1 we could take the 45 minute ride up there and use the transfer to get back. What a bargain!If we were to stay at the Ilikai again, we would definitely stay on the sunset side of the hotel where the views are beautiful, and it isn't noisy.","Goleta, California","Susie D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Goleta, California</strong>",30,4.0

The booking process was seamless. Gavin at Alohana communicates well and is really responsive. They ask you what what code number you want to use, so you can use a birthday or something easy to remember. Upon arrival you punch in the code to get into the room. No check in. Could not be easier.The room, though not luxurious, was well furnished and clean and really good value. The kitchen had been recently renovated with granite counters and nice solid wood cabinets. I chose this particular unit because it had two twin beds and a pull-out sofa, so my mom, my sister and I could each have our own bed. The beds, even the pull out, were comfortable,We had a nice 4th-floor view of the marina, and as a bonus we got a view from our balcony of the hula and Hawaiian music performance that the Ilikai put on that Friday night.I would definitely book this room again. Booking a privately-owned unit as opposed to an Ilikai-hotel-owned unit is usually substantially cheaper, but there is a downside. Each privately-owned unit is furnished by the owner, so each is different, whereas the hotel units are pretty uniformly furnished. Also, you pay in advance so unless your dates are firm, you risk losing all or part of your payment, depending on the policy of the booking agent or the owner.","Kona, hawaii","Chris77-563</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kona, hawaii</strong>",18,5.0

It is not on the beach although from some of the photos I saw prior to going I expected it be all but beach front. Our apartment looked out to other buildings and was not that pleasant. We would not stay here again. It just depends on what you want out of your holiday and accommodation, for us it was disappointing. As I said if we were to go back I would stay else where, even the Hilton Hawaiian next door! It looked very touristy but it also looked a lot more like what you would expect from a Hawaiian Resort.

The unit wasn't a one bedroom it was a unit with an accordion door which did not close at the end and had a 1 foot gap at top so allowed sound and light into room when we put our two year old to sleep. Door wasn't much more than a privacy screen. We lucked out though daughter slept well as long as we were quiet and didn't have a light on…must have been the balmy night air.

The lanai furniture is new, but the chairs aren't as comfortable as the old ones and the table is smaller. What is still the same is the fantastic view from the lanai.

This is right next door to the Hilton. You could watch their fireworks on Friday night. Easy access to Waikiki beach.The bed was a little on the hard side; the sofa bed mattress was soft and needs to be replaced. The lanai was great; quiet A/C unit. The kitchen was adequate for our needs; the knives were very dull and in need of sharpening or replacement. The night the wind blew all through the night you could hear it through the lanai doors. You could also hear the doors shaking. Not a good rest that night. Free wifi, it was fast.The bathroom had a few minor issues (no fan; could hear wind when it blew; only shower; no tub; the sink faucet is too close to the edge of the sink).It is very easy access off Ala Moana. Parking is $28/day- valet only. Parking in Waikiki is expensive. There is a close parking garage for $7/10 hours, but we didn't want to be watching the clock every morning and evening. There is an ABC store right around the corner. Next door all the Hilton shops and restaurants are available.

As this is an end unit, there are windows and balconies on two sides so there's lots of natural light. However since both those sides face streets and the hotel next door, we didn't open the curtains or sit on the balcony. Parking doesn't come with this condo so we paid to park in the Marina overnight for 10 hours ($1/hour).We would love to stay here again but it is pricey.

However, the hotel boasts 25 floors, which means the higher you go, the less road noise you deal with. But don't be fooled. If you are on the highway side ""Mountain View,"" you are still going hear the road (and sirens and buses and motorcycles) even at floor 22. The better bet is to spend the extra $30/night and get an ocean view (aka, non-Mountain View) room and have quiet. Some of the rooms are gorgeous. Recently renovated with top-of-the-mark design, the rooms are both cozy and extremely functional and pretty. Our king-sized bed with new mattress and white linens, was flanked by modern night stands and was footed by a great bench. Move about 5 feet away from the bed and you've got a comfy modern couch with elegant, modular end tables and side tables. Both the bed and the couch face a very large TV. Our kitchenette had everything--except a dishwasher. However, the cleaning service will do your dishes each day, which is nice. The bathroom follows suit with nice amenities and clean, large showers--big enough for three (if you're so inclined ;)One of the best parts of this hotel is the large lanai. Ours had two chairs and a table, which allowed for a great view of the mountain--and road noise. (More on how to avoid that in a minute.)Here's what you need to know: Get one of the rooms on the top four floors. They are the only ones that have been renovated to be awesome. The others, eh, not-so-much. And get a room facing away from the street.Other stuff:Parking is valet only and $24/day. ($12 if you're military or on business).Towels and chairs are free to use, but you have to use towel/chair cards to get them from the front desk. Easy peasy though.Pool looks good, but I'm a beach girl. Beach is right there...but you'll walk a little bit to really get there. This hotel fronts the marina. For us it was so not a big deal.

We rented it through Aloha Condos but all of the correspondence seemed to be directly with the owner Helen Ting. The condo is fairly small - just right for a couple. It has been renovated and has a very nice modern kitchen and bath. The lining room is partially separated from the sleeping area by a wall. It was very tastefully decorated and had an elegant feel. The best feature was the lovely balcony overlooking the marina. It was great for having morning coffee (often seeing a rainbow over the Ala Moana area) and having a drink watching the sun set over the harbor and ocean in the evening.The condo was very clean and quiet. There is good high speed internet included as well as basic TV channels and free long distance calling in North America. There were plenty of towels and some initial amenities (paper products, soap, shampoo, etc.) The building was very nice and clean. The pool was also nice although it closed a little early at 7:30 PM.The beach was a pleasant walk away on the opposite side of the Hilton Hawaiian Lagoon. Some beach equipment was provided (although we did not use it). Some nice beach towels were also provided.I do recommend renting a car to see Oahu but the on-site parking is valet only and very expensive. There is a self-park garage a short walk away on Hobron St. They will give you a special 24 hr. rate if you tell them you are staying at the Ilikai but even that is $20/day.This was not the cheapest place to stay (although we were able to save some money by eating breakfast on our balcony each day) but we loved it and would stay there again.

I didn't sleep in the master but my roomie said the shower was like needles she hated it but it had a big closet, it's own bathroom and a laini. i think it had it's own air con too. The other room didn't have aircon but instead had these fans that sucked air from the living room which was air con'd. There was another laini off this room and the living room.

And it wasn't a particularly child friendly pool, the pool attendants (fun police)where extremely hard on the kids when it appeared they would be having any fun at all.

We had a two bedroom corner suite with a full kitchenette and this made a world of difference in terms of space and convenience. It meant we could go shopping for our favourite food, my mother could whip up her famous breakfasts at leisure, which she loves to do, and we could all enjoy precious family time. Far healthier, more convenient, cheaper and more fun start to the day. So we can't comment on the hotel breakfasts, but we can definitely give thumbs up to the food and service at the fabulously luxurious Sarento's. Similarly we didn't have much lunch there either as we tended to be out during the middle of the day - but remember thinking the burgers at the Grill seemed a bit overpriced. There are too many dining options in this part of town to stay within the confines of the hotel.I was very impressed with the spaciousness of the accommodation.The suite definitely had a ""lived in"" look, but everything was functioning and more importantly, scrupulously clean. All chaos put to right - including the dishes- every day, so we were pretty pleased when we returned at the end of the dayApart from that what more to say? This is Waikiki, Honolulu at it's finest. The hotel's location means it's six minutes walk to the lagoon, which is perfect for the kids and activities like SUP and paddleboating. At the end of the week we felt safe enough for our 8 yr old to run down ahead by himself because we could see the lagoon from the room.The trolley stops outside the hotel which could not be more convenient for shopping and sightseeing tours. As a family we like walking so the longer distances down the boardwalk were appealing. Not being right at the centre of the action meant that when we returned to the tranquil end of Waikiki we felt like we were coming home to rest, relaxation and the ode-inspiring sunsets from the balcony.We will return!","Auckland, New Zealand","thethreeofus41</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",61,5.0

The suite was so new that you could spell the fresh paint and we had to call engineering to put lightbulbs in the lamps. Only knock is that the pool is small and dated especially for such a large hotel. Good location close to ala moana mall and don quijote 24 hr asian shopping market. Perfect place for families wanting a condo style accomodation and in the quieter side of waikiki but close enough to walk to the hustle and bustle of kalakua.

We chose this area as I was attending a conference and the convention centre is about 15 mins walk or 5 mins by Uber. Previously we had stayed in the Waikiki area.There were many pros-the Ilikai at Ala Moana is a good position in that it is 10 mins from the Ala Moana mall (great shopping for all ages and open until 9pm), close to several beaches and the Hilton Lagoon, and there were splendid views from our apartment over the marina and out to sea.The Ilikai is an older hotel, and as a vacation rental, the hotel does not provide any services (not even how to catch the bus, of which there were several stops outside). There is however a pool one can use (we didn’t, very spartan and uninspiring surrounds compared with the beach), a convenience store on the ground floor, and a coffee shop and restaurant which we didn’t use. One can also order in food ( California pizza is a good option, but avoid the ihop across the road).Next door is the Modern Hotel with very friendly staff and a lively pool area and a well known Japanese restaurant . On the other side of the hotel is the massive Hilton complex.The apartment (2602) was huge, and easily accommodated our grown up children with good cooking facilities, a comfortable couch and chairs, and good beds. There was great free wifi.The décor is dreadful-all white with low hanging chandeliers. There are two bedrooms which could be main bedrooms and one inside bedroom with 2 single beds. Two rather dated bathrooms are available but one is only accessed through the master bedroom. There was plenty of storage. The views from the large deck are beautiful. Cons-the air conditioning is simply not up to the task and needs replacing, ditto the outdoor furniture on the deck. We were always uncomfortable with the heat at night. One of the bedrooms is too crammed with two king beds, and also a couch, and two chairs. My husband had to move the bed to be able to get out of bed.. There is no phone. There were beach mats but no beach chairs which would have been appreciated. Similarly when one arrives late at night from an international flight, having some long life milk in the fridge would be helpful.We rented through Lais Costa at Hawaii 5-0 rentals and she was very helpful. We particularly appreciated a late check out when we needed to return to NZ on a 10.30pm flight. The apartment is expensive but given the position and size, we did not see a better option (so glad we were not a the Hilton next door) and we would definitely consider this apartment again. difficult to comment on others in the complex-we heard both positive and negative comments from other travellers and I wonder if there is significant variation.We rented a convertible car on this trip for several days (fun but expensive from a rental place just down the road) or one can go to Alamo across the road, cheaper but no convertibles. Driving up to the North Shore or to the Kailua beach region shows another lovely side of Ohau.We enjoyed breakfast just down the road at Goofeys (turn right out of the hotel and walk a block, look upstairs), slightly less so at Roys on Waikiki beach ( great views, food somewhat tasteless), shopped lots at Ala Moana (there is also a Nordstrum Rack not too far away), used Uber very easily to get around and went to the beach just in front of the hotel, or walked along the boardwalk toward Waikiki.

The website was relatively easy to navigate and see each room. The only downside was asking questions about the room - the person answering the emails always just directed us back to the main website.We are a family of 2 adults, a 3 yr old and 9 month old. In hindsite it would have been better to have rented a room with a sliding wall to separate the bed from the rest of the room/apartment. We had a portable travel tent for our baby but it took her a few nights to get used to the extra noise of us being in the room before she would sleep soundly (and we had to tiptoe around and turn the tv down).The kitchen was quite small but usable. The one downside was not having basic items such as salt, sugar, oil etc... Maybe we're used to rentals in Australia where those things are usually provided.The bathroom was decent - the shower space was a decent size and they provided amble towels.The location was good if you spent a lot of time at Ala Moana shopping centre (only a 5 min walk). It was a bit far from downtown Waikiki (15 min walk). However it is right next to the Hilton so we were able to make use of the lagoon everyday and also spent some time at some of the pools at the Hilton (although you will need a Hilton card to be able to use their towels - luckily a family member gave us hers before she left). The beach is also right next to the lagoon as well.For cheaper eating the foodcourt and restaurants at Ala Moana shopping centre are 5 min away. There's also some cheap japanese food across the rd as well (and McDonalds and an ABC shop).If you have rented a car you can park behind the Ilikai at the Marina for $1 per hr overnight.

It was the second time for myself (previously May 2013) and the third time for my mother (previously May 2013 & February 2014). We've stayed at many places in Honolulu, but since our first stay here in May 2013, we always come back. We love the quiet environment and nearby access to the beach, shopping, and places to eat. We made the reservation for our room back in May 2014 when it was a ""Mountain View"" special offer on their website. Since we always had Ocean View rooms there, we knew we this room would be on the street side, facing North toward the Mountains.When we arrived, the lady at the front desk was kind and courteous. Our room wasn't ready yet, so the concierge placed our bags in the secure storage, while we killed some time until our room was available. An hour later, the room was ready, just as the front desk lady said, and when we made our way to the third floor, to room #335, we were happily surprised it was not a Mountain View room, but a partial Ocean View room that also overlooked the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor! It was beautiful! And the room had a full kitchen with a nook and chairs. The bathroom was very clean and spacious! The staff at the Ilikai outdid themselves once again! It is also great to see the hotel has active security guards in uniform and constantly on foot, patrolling the grounds, inside and out. It's something you don't see too much at many hotels in the Honolulu area. So of there was ever a problem or emergency, the hotel security staff can be quickly located. We were glad they have their security personnel, especially when we stayed, as we learned that there were several thefts at the Hilton Hawaiian Village next door with many unhappy victims and the lack of hotel security presence. Kudos for the Ilikai staff for thinking about their customers' safety and welfare at all times! On our last day, we had an early checkout, so we notified the front desk 24 hours in advance, and once again when at the very moment we left. We did not even have to go to the front desk to checkout. They said to just leave the room card keys in the room and that was it. So easy, so simple! We once again had the most pleasant and memorable time staying at the Ilikai.Thank you, Aqua Ilikai!

Guest rooms are HUGE & some have fully equipped kitchens unlike the majority of hotel rooms in Waikiki. Food and supplies can be purchased at a grocery store across the street. Retail shops at the Hotel are just so so. Large convenience/sundries store is adequate. More dining options would be nice; however, not a big problem because just steps away from the Hotel are numerous food options. There are laundry facilities on each floor. Free Wi-Fi in rooms. Across the street is the Chart House restaurant. Happy Hour sunsets are breathtaking. I will definitely stay there again. Honolulu trips.",,Carol W,8,4.0

Most of the moderate hotes in Honolulu were noted as worn and old. The suite we got was not only very clean,but it was modern and updated.The kitchen was good and the appliances clean and very functional. The countertops were granite and that was a nice touch. The hotel location was key,it was centrally located and therefore easy to get around Waikki. You can either take the buses which ran on Ala Moana Blvd or pick up a taxi. We got a rental car from the airport for the last 2 days of our trip and travelled around the island. Parking at the Ilikai was easy,we just gave our keys to the valet and they handled the rest. The price was steep,it was $28.00 a day !Overall it was an excellent place to stay and if you are very picky like my wife is about things being clean-you will probably like this place. The only draw back for us was traffic noise, it is noticeable if you are on the city side. It was not horrible and didn`t prevent us from sleeping,but it was noticeable. The pool is clean,but on the small side. Walk to the beach is 2-4 minutes,but you will need to rent chairs and an umbrella for about $40-50 a day.(ouch) We were pleasantly surprised by our trip to Waikki as we had heard it was crowded and busy,we never really felt that way.",Canada,"Sara R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",35,4.0

Our suite well well appointed with ensuite shower room, a kitchenette with breakfast bar & full fridge/freezer, living area and double bed. We opted for a room that overlooked the lagoon, and thus had a perfect view of both the Friday night fireworks and the rooftop luau on the adjacent hotel. Laundry facilities are available on each floor near the main lifts.Rooms that overlook the marina would have a nice view out to sea too, but rooms facing the roadway might be somewhat noisier with the traffic etc. Our room was nice and quiet at night.The complex has a small Bar/Grill which serves good food, and lovely cocktails.There is a pool and sun lounger area that is private for residents & guests, and which has Ilikai wifi available. Separate wifi was provided in our room. This was an issue for us as it saved on UK roaming charges when contacting home. One slight negative observation regarding the pool area is the limited number of parasols (3 or 4 only) that are over tables & chairs.It is a 10 to 15 minute stroll from the Ilikai to the main Waikiki nightlife area, but the beach is only a couple of minutes away. The large Ala Moana shopping mall is a 10 minute stroll in the opposite direction & there are several very good dining establishments nearby. We liked this as it meant we were just out of the hustle & bustle of the main tourist/nightlife area, but within easy walking distance of everything we needed or wanted.Parking in the area is at a premium, but the nearby Waikiki Marina Resort at The Ilikai parking garage do a 24hr for $20 rate. Otherwise on street parking is around $1 per hour and is time restricted. there are plenty of shuttle busses that pass the door, so unless you are touring the island, a car is not really necessary. If you do want a car for a few days, consider pricing one for individual days rather that block booking. It might work out less expensive.All things considered, the Ilikai is an excellent holiday resort well worth considering.","Lisburn, United Kingdom","BarryM999</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lisburn, United Kingdom</strong>",125,4.0

Lots of browsing to be had at neighbouring Hilton shops. Lots of restaurants too. The Ala Moana Shopping Mall is a short bus strip, two or three stops or a 15 min walk. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel. Bus fares to Waikiki or Ala Moana are $2.50 per trip, good value. We had a room on 20th floor with really great views overlooking the marina.

Our room had 2 balconies - one with the most amazing view of the ocean and was the perfect spot to watch the Friday fireworks. The other was a marina / city view and nothing overly special. The second bedroom does face that side and got a fair bit of garbage truck noice in the morning. We also had a massive lounge and a decent kitchen. My only advice would be that bar fridges are not appropriate for 2 bedroom apartments as you can't do a big enough shop to be able to cook for a few days. The bathroom in the main bedroom was huge but for some reason had the tiniest bath / shower I have ever seen. With the shower curtain pulled across I actually felt a bit claustraphobic!!

The condos are owned by many different people so it really is a mixed bag here. My review is about the overall facility and NOT about the unit we rented. Why am I making the distinction? Simply because my experience with my unit and owner is unique. The Ilikai is located at what I consider to be the very beginning of the Waikiki area. Shopping and restaurants are only a short walk away. With that said, you are not in the center of it all and will have to walk 15 minutes or so to find the crowd and the ""action"". Only you can determine if that is good or bad. In my opinion, Waikiki is meant to be walked. It's a bit like Vegas in that regard. There is good public transportation here but your legs are your best bet. Plan to use them. With that in mind, where on the stretch you begin really doesn't matter.The Ilikai is 50 years old but it is pretty well maintained for it's age. If you want or need frills, I suggest you pay the extra money and go to one of the high end places because I think you would be disappointed with that here. Personally, I do not see that as a negative. It's just a matter of preference. My rating is based on what you get for what you pay.","Casa Grande, Arizona","Travelin41126</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Casa Grande, Arizona</strong>",71,4.0

Comfortable beds and bedding. No tub, but large shower with plenty of water volume. Friendly staff. Good on-site restaurant on ground level.Cons: Many floors are mostly condos. The one next to us was being remodleled w/construction noise, etc. Hotel said, ""We don't know anything about what the condo owners do."" ?!? Just be aware that you are in a mixed-use facility with condos, renters, time shares, etc. ""Ocean view"" depends on what part of the Y-shaped hotel you are in. In our room it meant you can see the ocean if you lean out over the balcony. Otherwise you are looking at the highrise hotel next door. Evenings, the view is more remiscent of Manhattan than Hawaii, but that is true of just about all of Honolulu now. The Ilikai is not really a resort. They have a pool and a concierge plus attractive (and rarely crowded ) public areas. You can use the Hitlon's lagoon next door and the beach is about a block walk around the yacht harbor.

It must of been magnificent in its prime , it's now celebrating its fiftieth year anniversary . . 50 years it's a little tired but still in very good condition . The foyer is classic and beautiful . The views are amazing . There are three sections so views from your apartment depend on which way your balcony faces . We had a lovely view of the lagoon and the Friday night fireworks where other apartments face the marina or the front street . Also the apartments can differ on many levels , whether or not you have booked thru the hotel or private condos . Some are renovated fully some a little and some not at all . So getting a nice one is abit of luck . They have a lot of lifts maybe as many as six so waiting for a lift is quick . We went to the bar and grill and had an excellent fish lunch . There is always a doorman at the front lobby . There is a fully stocked shop also in the lobby which is handy and a coffee shop downstairs as well . The pool is always full no matter when you go there but the lagoon and beach are only a five minute walk and much nicer anyway . The balconys are a good size to sit on and have a drink in the afternoon . The apartments have kitchens so are great to prepare light meals , don't think I would be making a roast but a sandwich or salad they are perfect for . Beds comfortable and air conditioning is good . Lovely outside seating area and gardens are well kept . A lot of people live permanently at The Ilikai so the regulars are usually by the pool or sunning themselves .

I'm so glad I did and was lucky enough to have this condo available for the exact dates I needed. It is as described . Everything anyone would need. The view is great ,beds comfortable and kitchen and bathroom well stocked. The owners were very responsive and accommodating . Never had any issues during our stay . We never needed a car because we could walk to Ala Moana Center and Lewers St if we needed to shop and the front entrance is a few feet away from bus stops. I like the sliding sun shade in the balcony . It keeps the integrity of the view but gave me the option to block the sun during certain times of the day . The kettle also needs to be replaced. But these minor issues won't make me hesitate to return to this place. What really puts it over the top is the Ilikai itself. The building is clean and lobby was amazing. Fresh air blowing as if you were outdoors and not too many people so you can definitely relax away from your room.

We have stayed at least 6 times at the Ilikai and love it here. This time we had condo 1820 with again great views of the lagoon and ocean. We had to purchase new pillows as several of the ones on our beds smelt like very dirty hair. We stayed for 3 nights then left for Vegas arriving back 4 days later into 1820 again. On arrival we found that the bedding had not be changed and were still marked from our previous stay. We don't know if anyone else had booked the room during our time away. We contacted management and a few hours later two very friendly ladies arrived to change our bedding. As we had basically made two bookings for the same room which meant two cleaning fees I expected the bedding to have been changed. We then had a problem with the oven...it wouldn't work which was very annoying as we had purchased food to prepare using the oven. Finally after several calls to maintenance and several days later they said that the stove/oven would be replaced the next day around 4pm. This was useless to us by this stage as we were leaving at 7pm that night and had to throw out the food we had bought to be cooked in the oven. They arrived around 4pm...opened the door without knocking and barged in...then knocked...glad I was dressed. I am assuming at no-one had come to check the oven out and just went and replaced it that they already know it was faulty. This cost us $$$ as we had to get takeaway on the nights we should have been able to prepare meals for ourselves. I love staying at the Ilikai but this time was disappointed with the condo and the obvious problems.

The hotel itself was very nice and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The only downside was the pool area and the bar! The pool (which is a salt water pool) was a bit dated, and there was no bar service between the pool and bar. We were told its because the bar area is rented out and the hotel will not allow them to provide bar service in the pool area, which meant everytime we wanted a drink it was a trek for both of us to the bar if we both fancied a beer (due to the drinking laws in Hawaii where they will only serve one beer per person). Think the hotel is missing a trick with this one!! Anyway it was a lovely stay - the location was spot on too with a 10 minute walk into the middle of Waikiki. Bus stop right outside the hotel as well. I think to stay at this hotel is budget dependent to be honest.

Was really not up to par with what I expected. it started from when I walked into the lobby with the fake flowers collecting dust - there were a few green plants in the lobby, but the majority of them were dried up and dying. Really just so tacky. I had checked this hotel out on Trip Advisor and read through several reviews which made it seem like most of the rooms had been updated. Well, I guess I got one of the rooms that was not updated. This hotel also has owner condos so you could get one of the condo type rooms that are all decorated individually. My co-worker got a room that was a private type condo from the rental pool and he said his was really nice with a full kitchen and hardwood floors. Mine looked like it hadn't been updated since the original Hawaii Five-O days (if you are familiar with the original series from the 70's this hotel was used in it quite a bit). My carpet was pulling up, the bathroom door was grimey, there was mold on the bottom of my shower mat (I mean how easy is it for them to spray some bleach when cleaning the room?). The bathrooms were so dated. There were 2 showers in the bath room (one in the toilet room and one with a tub in the outter bathroom) both of the showers used old style vinyl liners so once you got into the shower, it was so dark because the heavy liners didn't let any light in! it was like showering in the dark!! The nice thing was the room was on the 25th floor, which was right below the Penthouse and I had a view of the lagoon and back side of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The view was great (although they charged me an additional $15 per night for the ""upgraded/high floor room""). It was not worth it. During my stay the construction workers were pounding starting at 8am either below my floor or above me doing re-construction apparently. I asked to move to another room, but there was supposedly only 1 room available that once I viewed, I decided to stay where I was and put up with the noise. The other room was on a much lower floor with a marina view but closer in to the elevators so when you sat out on your balcony, the other units all looked directly in on you. I prefer the room at the far end of the hallway towards the ocean as it felt a little more private...just a little.The pros of my stay were that I had a front row view from my balcony on Friday night watching the the fireworks go off from the beach of the lagoon. The coffee shop in the lobby has pretty good coffee. The location is at the start of Waikiki beach so not too crazy busy in that location and about 2 long blocks walk to the Ala Moana shopping center if you are interested. The wifi worked fine for me. I don't think I will be staying here again unless a total renovation has been done.","San Francisco, California","DNAZ_SF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",67,3.0

There are also timeshares (Shell Vacations) operating out of the Ilikai but we did not stay in a timeshare.Pros - 1. The Ilikia is located at the west end of Waikiki Beach and is much quieter than the areas around the major hotels east of Lewers Street (if quiet is what you want – it’s a con if it’s not.) You have the beach in front of the Hilton Hawaiian as well. The entire area is not nearly as busy as the east portion of Waikiki.2. You are close to the Ala Moana Mall and the Magic Island Lagoon (in Ala Moana Park) which is the easiest, safest and best swimming beach we have found on the entire island (although Hanauma Bay is pretty nice.) The above two reasons are why we came back four times.3. A number of reviews commented that the Wi-Fi was very slow but Oceanic Time Warner just did an upgrade of every single room in the building so it works very well now.4. The Ilikai is built with 3 wings regardless of whether it is the hotel, owned condos or timeshares; the Diamond Head, Ewa and Makai. For Diamond Head and Ewa, try to stay in units ending in even numbers so that you face the water. If you are in an odd numbered unit, you will be in a ""city lights"" room meaning you face Ala Moana Blvd and it is a busy street. Also, if you like to sleep with your windows open, the rooms in the ""Diamond Head"" wing (room numbers ending in 12 up to 26) are noisier as trucks unload their wares early in the morning. Rooms ending in 02 up to 10 are in the Ewa wing and are quieter. Diamond Head rooms are better for watching the many fireworks displays and the Ewa wing is better for sunsets. Overall, Ewa is preferred as long as it is on the water side and you’re staying for any length of time. We were recently in unit 1718 and our friends were in 1608 and 1608 was quite a bit quieter. We have not stayed in the Makai wing (which runs to the water) so both odd and even-numbered rooms have water views. But the Makai rooms ending in odd numbers face the area with the trucks so they likely would be noisier than the even numbered rooms. At least none of the Makai rooms face Ala Moana Blvd.5. The manager of the hotel invited us to a cocktail party the second time we stayed here which was very courteous of him. We were planning a third visit in the hotel however we wanted to stay a month and owned condo units are less expensive than the hotel for a month so we booked into an owned unit instead. Cons - 1. The Ilikia just celebrated its 50th anniversary and the hotel shows it. While all suites on the 23rd and 24th floors were either recently renovated or were in the process of being updated, the building overall has a long way to go. For example, the plumbing is old meaning the water is not great so you will need bottled water for your morning coffee and drinking water. The bathrooms are very dated and need a complete overhaul as does the carpeting. The six weeks we stayed in the hotel (2 couples) were in a 2 bedroom unit with a bar fridge and cook top stove so you always go out for meals. The refrigerators and stoves may have been improved when the renovations were completed on the 23rd and 24th floors but I am not sure so I would ask if you plan to stay in one. The owned condos have full refrigerators and a full oven. Also, the 2 bedroom is really a 1 bedroom plus a separate area enclosed by a couple of sliding doors for the other couple.2. The owned condos are advertised as being fully equipped but that is a stretch. You should bring your own cooking knives (a knife sharpener is provided but does not help with serrated edge knives), wine glasses, drinking glasses and salad bowls. Also bring your own tea pot if you drink same. The knives, forks, spoons, plates and bowls are minimally adequate for two. You will have to shop at Foodland or Don Quijote (they spell the name Quijote rather than Quixote) shortly upon your arrival for necessities so check-in to your unit first to see what is needed. Our friends who stayed in 1608 had a better outfitted unit from ours so the units vary. The condos are all studios (which is noted on the booking website) so they really are suited for 2 people even though it says 3 on the website.3. If you have significant problems with an owned condo, you may find that issues are not resolved in a timely manner. Our unit had a defective (i.e. loud) motor in the air conditioner which we brought to the attention of Bert, the on-site representative. Bert identified the problem as a motor as did the A/C tech but it was not fixed during the last two weeks that we brought this to Bert’s attention. (Also our fault as we should have brought this to Bert’s attention when we first got there; initially we slept without A/C and did not know the motor was defective. Once the humidity spiked up we used A/C and we immediately heard the noise. We should have turned it on upon arrival.) I spoke with Bert just before we left and he had no idea when or if it will be repaired. We think it possible that the previous renter had the same problem as the motor was noisy as soon as we turned it on so the issue must have existed for some time. If you are used to things being repaired quickly, you may be sadly disappointed but it is Hawaii and things are a bit more relaxed.4. The owned condos appeal to seniors who are in Hawaii for roughly one to three months. The pool is regularly used by many of these seniors and you will see the same people at the pool (good if you like meeting up with friends and bad if you want a place for your kids to swim.) Generally, the Ilikai appeals to older people given its quiet location so if you have a couple of young children, this is probably not the place to go.Hawaii is expensive because there is more demand for rooms than there is supply. Consequently, many Waikiki hotels charge higher prices compared to the mainland and this is true of the Ilikai. If you really like Waikiki and want to be there for a long stay, the condos are less expensive and quieter than many hotels in Waikiki but the rooms have issues. I don’t think I recommend it for families with young children for a shorter stay. While more expensive, each building in the Hilton Hawaiian has its own pool so it is much better for children than the Ilikai.","Seattle, Washington","Peter L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",11,3.0

After a very long flight with little sleep we appreciated this very much. There were 3 ladies sharing a room for 7 days and we found the room big enough to accommodate us even with a trundle in it. The balcony was quite big but unfortunately we had only 2 chairs on it. Housekeeping was very hit and miss and every day we had no extra toilet paper provided. With 3 ladies...... Say no more!! We pulled up our beds each day and no attempt was made to make them properly unless we left them fully unmade. We had no extra toiletries in the bathroom till day 4. We booked a room with a kitchenette and we had a coffee machine but no kettle or salt and peppers provided. Just the basics.The beach is a short walk and the lagoon is just next door which was great as the pool is far too small for a hotel this size and we could never get a lounge chair.Overall we had a great time and we would return to the Ilikai fully aware that by our standards it is not a 4 star hotel.,Melbourne,"lizzy77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",31,3.0

Love the location, the history and views. However.... if you like to swim and expect to find a seat at the pool together (2) almost any time of day this isn't the hotel for you. We ended up sharing a chase, briefly, and only once in the entire week we were there. And don't expect to avoid the crowds by swimming the evening because the pool gate is locked! No food or beverages are allowed in the pool area and was surprised to learn that it was a chlorine. What is Hawaii without memories of some relaxing downtime at the pool. We really missed that. Very disappointing. I wish I'd seen a review like this on Trip Advisor.Some of the staff was very friendly but somewhat spotty at the front desk. The rooms are large, basic and clean but this hotel is tired and the rooms are in need of renovating.The veneer on the bottom of our bathroom door had been peeling off for some time, had been painted over and was still peeling. If you want to print out your boarding pass you'll be directed to a rolling cart in a small corner with an ancient computer beside the front desk.

The kitchen in our suite was fine and could have been better stocked (more plates, pans) but we managed. While its a bit of a walk to the main strip, the hotel is located close to the beach (easy walking over the bridge) and better yet you can use the Hilton Lagoon if you have small children. The hotel also loans out beach chairs and boogie boards (just as the front desk) which were clean and came in great use.

I would have expected to have at least 2 wine or champagne glasses in an honeymoon suite, but you will have to use the typical bathroom style glasses. No oven, no dishwasher.There is a huge bathtub (non Jacuzzi), but no bubble bath or salts, nothing.No room service at all, you have to order online for room delivery (9$ extra)The pool is very small and packed, shadowed until 2 PM.Wifi is free, but disconnects every 15 minutes. Streaming music is not an option.The Ugly:Entirely non smoking but one small and remote section. (Most people will move this comment to the GOOD section :)Parking (28$) is valet only, it was next to impossible to find parking in this area.The restaurant at ground level is serving horrible food, the wine was slightly better than vinegar.You can't bill it to your room, that is probably a good thing, you really want to forget everything about this place.

I almost called the CEO & had him listen to it but called the desk instead. The supervisor was friendly but had no authority to do anything without contacting the Manager so after a couple of calls, we were moved to another room. For the inconvenience the Manager provided a basket of goodies but we were then subjected to construction across the street! The hotel is outdated and location is not great. Too far from Waikiki Beach however it is quieter. The Bar & Grill had decent food & prices but a couple of the waitresses were surly. The front desk staff were friendly.

Our expectations weren't high- as not too many places had rooms, so we thought this hotel must be past its prime- remember its claim to fame is being the hotel upon whose balcony Jack Lord spins around on the opening credits of the original Hawaii 5-0.We couldn't have been more wrong. The hotel is lovely, well-kept, well-staffed and in a prime location at the beginning of Waikiki.We disagree with the reviewer not liking the 2 bedroom suite. We thought it was beautiful and functional - the kitchen and a full dining room table was very nice. Though we agree the decor is somewhat dated, though not bad.Totally agree that their WIFI leaves something to be desired.Dining options are limited at this hotel.

We liked the fact that there were separate bedrooms and an efficiency kitchen advertised. My wife and I planned to take one room while her parents took the other. The kids would be on the pull out couch and/or the floor. We had successfully stayed in other suites/hotels in this manner before. Note: this is definitely not a 2 bedroom suite!The second ""bedroom"" was simply an area of the living area that had louvered sliding doors to close it off. The doors did not block out any light, let alone sound, from the living area. In fact, if the curtains in the area with the beds were left open to enjoy the view, you could see inside the room from the living area, even with the doors slid shut.The beds were doubles and there was no tv, no closet or dresser but a single one drawer nightstand. I note the main bedroom was entirely as expected. King bed, dresser, tv, ensuite bathroom.The efficiency kitchen is just that. It did have an oven, cooktop, and microwave. A toaster was available upon request. The refrigerator was of the mini variety but we squeezed in the essentials. We ended up buying a coffee maker because the one provided brewed just 1 or 2 cups at a time. Inside the hotel, there are a few shops but the great part is the mini grocery which sells everything from alcohol to cereals to soy sauce to peanut butter to eggs and bread so you can cook basic meals/breakfast if you want in your room. There are 3 ABC stores within a 5 minute walk as well (selling everything grocery and otherwise as well). The living area was adequate. Tv, but no DVD player, pullout couch, a sitting chair and a table/desk. We also had a dining table with 6 chairs. There were an additional 4 deck chairs for outdoors and two small tables. The decor is somewhat dated but serviceable. The wireless internet was just awful; it was hard to establish a connection, stay connected, or have multiple devices connected. You get what you pay for (it is free). And who comes to Waikiki to spend time in the room anyways???And that is where this hotel has a huge advantage. It is just a great location. You can walk to the mall; you can walk to a giant green space/park; right outside the hotel is a marina; then the start of Waikiki beach. There is no need to cross any busy street as the hotel is ocean side, which was good for us with our small kids. The entrance to the beach includes a separate sandy area/lagoon where you can rent paddle boards, kayaks, and waterbees/pedal boats. You can also sign up for surf lessons (recommended!) and other beach activities. You are right next to a plethora of shops and restaurants and can walk further for more of Waikiki shopping and entertainment. It all seems handicap/stroller accessible as well with paved pathways around the lagoon. There are a lot of people and there is a lot of action around here; quiet and peaceful don't come to mind but great for kids of all ages and adults who want some more liveliness. So bottom line, this is a hotel in a great location although the suite left some things to be desired. On a price per head basis, and considering the kitchenette and living area, it proved good value overall.

This time I booked a hotel room (lagoon view) with full kitchen. I like the history at the Ilikai and the location and nearby beach works for us. There seemed to be more in the lobby area this time; a good coffee shop, a convenience store, clothing store and bar etc. The room was huge with a nice big balcony but was seriously dated and the kitchen had the bare minimum. I didn't plan on cooking but wanted a fridge, coffee pot that I could make a good pot of coffee in, and a kettle. The coffee pot was a single-cup style with coffee pods supplied daily. No kettle. I tried to change rooms because I didn't think the price was worth it for us to have the kitchen and ended up receiving a kettle and a better rate which helped cover the $28/day valet parking. The room is 655 sf but had just one bed, and you wouldn't want anyone to sleep on the old couch if you brought the family. It was clean though and the view from the large balcony was good. Good toiletries. I liked the vintage Christmas decorations in the lobby area and the torch lighter at sunset. There was some construction going on (a bit of loud banging during the day) so I hope they update all the rooms or I would probably choose a privately owned suite again. Good value for the size of the room though, you get what you pay for and the Ilikai is quite reasonable for Honolulu. Close to the Chart House restaurant, always a favorite.

They had several TV's so you could watch your favorite games while having a drink or meal. The drinks were reasonably priced and the food was basic, but good. Everybody was very polite and accommodating. One of the things I really liked about this hotel was the location. While not right on the beach, it was on the beach side of the main road going through Waikiki, so you did not have to cross any streets to get to the lagoon and beach which were only a couple of minutes from the back of the hotel. My wife and I took several trips to the main part of Waikiki where all the high end shops are. We thought we were walking down the strip in vegas on a saturday night, it was that crowded. This was not the case around the Ilikai hotel. While there were plenty of people, shops, restaurants and bars around, there was nowhere near the foot traffic. We never felt crowded at this end of the beach. I will definitely be staying here again and would recommend it to any looking for a moderately priced nice hotel.

No need to rush as you can stop off at one of the hotels for a feed or refreshment along the way - very civilised. If you are a people person you will love mixing with the locals and other tourists. Taxis are numerous and well priced. Just watch out for the driver with no knowledge of the area and who uses the GPS on his phone to move around! Best to book months ahead as Ilikai gets very, very busy. Staff that we came across were attentive and the security was noticeable. The lanais are of good size and if you get the lagoon /ocean side you will see the fireworks on Friday night and you may get to watch and listen to the luaus being performed at Hilton rooftop at no charge! We think your pocket, stomach, and the rest-fullness of the Ilikai will be appreciated by most guests. We will return in the very near future.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","richardmartin747</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",21,5.0

We stayed two weeks (our first time at the Illakai) and would definitely stay again. I would have given it a five star rating except for the fact that our room could have used an upgrade (old tv, archaic microwave, etc.) Still there are signs eveywhere that maintenance is being done (carpets are new in the hallways and workmen are at work in various places). The pool is smallish and the ladders at the deeper end are rusted and loose - be careful if your a senior like me. All in all, we would stay again and if you go and like shrimp try the cocanut shrimp at the bar and grill. Also, if you stay here, a good place to go for breakfast is right across the street at a little spot called Snappers - 3.99 for two eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast.

We had a GREAT stay here. One of the highlights is that our room faced the ocean, with a great view. PLUS, we had a front row seat to the Hilton's fireworks show on Tuesday and Friday. This was AWESOME!! The room was clean and comfortable. We didn't really use the kitchen, although it did have a full size fridge, stove/oven combo, microwave and sink. The hotel looks a bit old on the outside, but inside everything was very modern and new. (Okay, except the elevators, they still look a bit out dated.) The bathroom had marble counter tops and a flat screen TV and such.There's a small grocery store in the lobby of the hotel, which was very convenient. Unfortunately, there's no parking lot and the valet was pretty expensive for a week's stay. (Although, I think you have this problem at every hotel in Waikiki). The location is fantastic as you're steps away from Waikiki beach and right next door to the Hilton. Downtown Waikiki is a bit of a long walk, but despite that, we walked down to the main part of town several times on our week long stay. The mall is also a short walk, so we wandered down there one afternoon. If I stay here again, I wouldn't even bother renting a car.

We were also hoping that the reviews about the condo were accurate and that we'd at last find a clean place in Waikiki. We've stayed several times, usually 1-2 nights while we wait for a flight to another island and have had a hard time finding a place that isn't run down with moldy bathrooms and beds that smell of sweat and worse (and that's despite paying $150+ for a room!). What a wonderful gift this place was: nicely renovated, well-cleaned, good beds with fresh-smelling linens. The fridge was large and new and ran very quietly. Didn't try the stove...salads from ABC Store and the mall food store were sufficient for us. The room was spacious and bright, which beats a tiny cube of a hotel room any day. The view over the marina was so fantastic that my husband spent a great deal of time in the comfy chairs on the lanai, watching everything that was going on. The view is particularly stupendous at night. We just couldn't stop taking photos of the same thing at different times of day, in the rain, in the sun, etc. The Ilikai is located just beside the start of the Waikiki Beach and is also very close to Ala Moana Beach, which is far less busy and has very calm, relatively warm water. We walked everywhere: down to the Kapiolani Park, over to the historic Honolulu city centre, along the beaches, etc. We also took The Bus, once from the airport, after returning our rental car (we didn't have luggage with us, knowing that there are restrictions on what you may take on the bus) and once from the 'Iolani Palace area. Both times we got off at the Ala Moana mall rather than the bus stop just outside the hotel because it was so darn cold on the bus that we needed the walk to defrost! Situated overlooking the pool and eating area as it was, there was some noise: the first night was great since we got to listen to Hawaiian music and watch hula dancing, which looked a little odd since we were looking down at the dancers' heads. The music didn't go on for too long and everything quieted down nicely for the night. The next night was harder. Some youngsters talked until 3:30 a.m. They weren't rowdy, just excited about life. It is true that we had the doors open rather than shutting ourselves away with the air conditioning, but the closed doors hadn't done too much to block out the music the night before, so I suspect we would have heard the talking at least as clearly. We didn't really allow the noise to bother us too much because we had made the choice to overlook the pool area, knowing it would probably be somewhat noisier.Small things are important: there was a laundry room on our floor: cost $2.50 per washer/dryer. The elevators were efficient, quiet and the ride was smooth, something that one likes when going up and down to the 21st floor! We never had to wait long. If you come in from the beach, you can use to the Bathers Elevator. There's no key or key card: you just input a code and turn the lock. While it's handy not having to worry about a key or card, it also means you have to remember that code. There's no check-in either, which means you a) have to remember to bring the information page you are sent (including the key code) and b) are really stuck if you forget that info page or your code! The only weird thing was the tub in the bathroom. The side was so high we almost needed to pole-vault in. If you have hip problems or are short, you'd pretty well have to rely on the ocean to keep you clean. We only stayed 2 nights which wasn't as good a deal as if we'd stayed for a week or so because the cleaning fee is pretty hefty. However, we would do it again because of the location and quality of the place and because we don't like to spend any more time in Waikiki than we have to. The energy in this touristy place is too much for us to consider any longer stays. Waikiki Beach Rentals was easy to work with and the hotel staff (not related to the rental agency)that we encountered were very pleasant.","Abbotsford, Canada","Travelling-Christy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Abbotsford, Canada</strong>",4,5.0

However this area is very accessable by the $2 bus and even walkable if you can handle the heat from the Ilikai.

Nice size shower and plenty of hot water. Beach chairs and towels were great. TV and WiFi worked fine. The elevator was super fast and a great place to talk to other visitors. Location is fine. There is a little walk to the beach area so if you have small children be prepared. We enjoyed the walk. The units facing the ocean get warm from the afternoon sun. Thankfully the AC worked good. We kept the curtains shut while not in unit to help with keeping the heat out.The lanai is great with table and chairs.Things we did while staying here: island tour with Enoa, golf day at the Royal Hawaiian (beautiful and challenging course), cab to Diamond Head and hiked up for the sunrise. Hike up is not easy but doable. Wear comfy shoes, take water and comfy shoes. Ate at the Chart House (close to Ilikai and delicious steak dinner), Duke's (great buffet breakfast), Fumi's Shrimp Farm (yum) and another place where I had delicious Opah fish.

As such we had minimal interaction with the hotel staff, but what we did have was fantastic. The valets and pool attendants are EXCELLENT! It should be criminal to have as much energy as those valets do at 6am! :) Valet parking is $25 per night, we paid for the convenience and an early start, but there are secure car parks right next door for around $7 for 10 hours.The overall hotel is nice, well maintained and in the ideal location for us as we have no desire to be in the heart of Waikiki with all the hustle and bustle of shops that never seem to close. We walked from Ilikai to Waikiki Beach Walk one night, its a very pleasant 15min walk, probably not so nice in the heat of the day though.Our apartment was overlooking the road, with only a small view from the balcony of the beach and water - but do you really travel to somewhere like Waikiki to sit on your balcony?? We certainly don't! Its less than 10 minutes walk to the Ala Moana Center, car rental agencies are right across the road, public transport stops right outside, and of course the beach and the lagoon are right on your doorstep. There are a couple of ABC stores within a minute's walk for your essential supplies, or you can go to the Foodland at the Ala Moana Center for more substantial groceries (this is where its handy to have 'pack horses' in the form of two almost teens to help carry a bag of groceries each, saving on bus or taxi fares!)A very enjoyable stay!","Sydney, Australia","DeirdreA775</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",7,4.0

The Ilikai is our go to hotel. The location is excellent. The view is great, especially if you have an ocean view. It's close enough to Waikiki so that if you want to do the tourist thing, it's within walking distance. If you want to walk to Ala Moana to shop for anything, it's within walking distance. If you want to drive anywhere, it's outside of Waikiki so it's easy to get to just about any streets you'd need to use to get to anywhere you need to go (if you stay at a hotel on the Waikiki strip, you could spend up to 15 minutes just trying to get out of the Waikiki area when you're trying to drive somewhere). If you're traveling on business, the internet connection is free and is one of the fastest I've had in any hotel. If you're traveling with children or just don't want to always rely on restaurants to eat or want to be able to store leftovers, they have rooms with kitchens. When I travel on business I occasionally have to do press appearances, which means leaving the hotel by 4:30AM, well before any place is open for breakfast, so a kitchen is a must. One thing to note: the place overall is very quiet. One of the more quiet hotels I've stayed at anywhere. This is largely because (a) the building is a bit older (built in the 60's) so the walls are thicker then some newer hotels and (b) a good portion of the units are permanent residences.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","marginalKI</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",2,5.0

We had a one bedroom studio on the 17th floor for a VERY reasonable rate! Beautiful view of the ocean, lagoon and marina. We really didn't know what to expect since we usually exchange with Hilton and Marriot Vacation Clubs when we go to Hawaii. But, this year we were only able to get one week at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, due to availability. We were not disappointed with the Ilikai!! We spent the first week at the Hilton thru the Vacation Club and then moved over to the Ilikai. It all worked out perfectly. Dainora knew the situation and that we were checking out of the Hilton and I had asked if there was somewhere we could store luggage till the usual 3:00 check in time and she was able to arrange for us to check in early! It was wonderful! The place was clean and stocked with linens and necessities. When we arrived, the hotel staff and bellmen were very helpful in telling us where to go, etc. And, they even helped with our luggage on arrival even tho we weren't actually hotel guests. We thought the whole hotel was very nice ... clean, not noisy, crowded, etc. Very nicely decorated and open. We ate at the bar and restaurant a couple of times ... once for a sit down and twice got things to go and brought it upstairs. The food isn't bad and the prices are reasonable. The elevators are plenty and quick. We didn't use the pool since we prefer the ocean and do a lot of day trips, but it looked nice. You can see the Hilton Luau and Fireworks if you like that sort of thing from the balcony. Being a private rental within the hotel, you have to call the owner with any issues since you're not actually a 'registered guest'. We had a couple of minor glitches when we arrived, but they were taken care of immediately. We like that end of Waikiki ... always have. Somehow it seems 'in the action but also a tad away from it all'!! There's a walkway to the Hilton and you can use the lagoon and beach or as we did many times walk all the way down to our favorite places like the Shorebird, etc. All in all it was a great week. Dainora couldn't have been more helpful, or anyone else at the hotel for that matter. We received our security deposit back within a week as well. I would recommend this highly to anyone.

Kitchen utensils were rather light on as well, not really keeping with the 'aloha' spirit of things.

Hotel: We chose the high floor mountain view room primarily because we were only there for two nights and thought the lights at night would be pretty. We were right, the evening view was very pretty and we were treated to a stunning sunrise in the morning. However, we would choose an oceanview room in future because the traffic noise from the lanai was very unpleasant. Closing the door completely deadened the noise so sleeping wasn’t a problem, but having breakfast and drinks on the lanai wasn’t relaxing. Opt for the $10 per night high floor upgrade, the views are well worth the extra cost. Our room on the 25th floor was very spacious and comfortable, although a little tired looking. The rooms will be fabulous after the current upgrade is finished. We would happily stay here again for location, atmosphere and value for money – it’s next to the Hilton Hawaiian Village, a nice area of town and a good place to wander around for an evening stroll, and it is an easy and pleasant walk to either Ala Moana, the beach, the Ala Moana Reserve lagoon or the heart of Waikiki.Condo: We’d stayed in the same condo (2006) the previous year and absolutely loved the unit and the view over the marina. A minor grizzle is that glassware consisted of numerous chunky glass and plastic tumblers, one cracked flute and no wine glasses, there wasn’t a single teaspoon in the unit, and the towels varied greatly in quality, some were very good but others were extremely thin - more attention should be paid to these things. Having said that, the unit is very spacious, clean and comfortable, the furnishings are attractive, the location is great and the views from the unit are stunning, so we wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again. We were kindly given a free early check in after disembarking the ship (which can be arranged the day before if the unit is unoccupied prior to your check in). This was a great bonus for us, and we found Scott to be very efficient and pleasant to deal with throughout.Tip – if you need groceries, you can get a 5% discount at Foodland (at Ala Moana) if you give them your phone number (we gave the hotel’s phone number), and if you shop at Macys, ask for their tourist discount card, which gives you a 10% discount on purchases.The Hilton puts on a stunning firework display on Tuesday and Friday evenings, around 7.45pm – well worth popping down to the Hilton Lagoon for a ringside view.The bar & grill downstairs is very reasonably priced, the food is good and it’s a great location with a lovely outlook.All in all we had a lovely stay and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to others.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","JeanandKeith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",3,5.0

I live on the east coast (Atlantic Ocean side) of Canada so travelling to Hawaii is a long day of flying. I have visited Oahu once before but this time my husband and I decided to take a cruise from Ensenada, Mexico across the Pacific where we could visit several Hawaiian islands before disembarking in Honolulu. The cruise was great but part of our plan was to stay at the Ilikai Hotel and Suites in Waikiki. I was really looking forward to another visit at the Ilikai. It is one of my favourite hotels. My daughter and her family found the Ilikai some years back and passed on the good news to me. I stayed there in 2010 for 10 days and this recent trip, with my husband, was a four night stay once we left the cruise ship in the port of Honolulu. I was very happy to be going back to the Ilikai because I knew from my previous vacation that it would be top notch and not the least bit stressful. The hotel has a homey atmosphere with friendly staff and a comfortable feeling that allows you to relax the minute you walk into the lobby. There are a number of shops in the hotel where you can spend time browsing, buying some beautiful Hawaiian fashions or obtaining articles you might have forgotten at home. The Ilikai has a wonderful outdoor/indoor cafe/restaurant which offers a good variety of menu items and drinks. Friday night there is always a wonderful Hawaiian band and hula dancers to entertain you while you dine or enjoy a drink under the starry sky.On Tuesday and Friday nights along the beach there is a great display of fireworks which adds to the entertainment found in the area.Our room, located on the 25th floor, was spacious and sunny with a magnificent view of the Ala Moana Beach Park and the local yacht club which is only a short walk. This beach and park area caters to people who have physical challenges and has a number of wheelchair walkways. This is a wonderful place to enjoy the sand and surf in a lovely family park atmosphere. The concierge at the hotel was more than helpful setting up our car rental. She will arrange any type of tour or adventure you want to enjoy. The office wall is filled with information on things to do while visiting Honolulu and the island of Oahu. We used the concierge to reserve our rented car which has an office located right across the street from the hotel in a small shopping centre. There are lots of small restaurants nearby with a variety of foods from around the world. Most of these restaurants and cafes have a daily happy hour each evening from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m and then there is the fast food chains if you happen to be in a hurry and want to grab a bite on the go. Not far from the hotel (about a 15 minute walk) is the Ala Moana Mall which has 290 stores and is open seven days a week. This beautiful mall offers something for everyone. Right outside the hotel door is the city bus stop and for $2.50 you can ride anywhere you want. There are also a number of hop on/hop off trolley stops in front of the hotel. If you want to walk to the central area of Waikiki Beach down near the International Market it would take about 45 minutes. It is a lovely walk that passes beautiful parks and lots of wonderful shops, restaurants and other hotels. If you have your own car the Ilikai's valet service will look after you. The Ilikai Hotel offers beautiful spacious rooms with large comfortable beds. The feature I enjoyed the most was the large patio sliding doors and windows as well as the lovely balconies. We had a wall of glass which gave us a spectacular view of the yacht club, the cruise ships coming and going and sunsets that were out of this world. We also had a small bar refrigerator, a microwave and a coffee maker. We usually had morning coffee and then went downstairs for breakfast. Having the beautiful park just a short walk away makes you feel you are not really in a big city but in a more rural setting. The park and beach are excellent for those who enjoy a morning or late afternoon swim and it is also great for walkers and those wishing to jog. The Ilikai Hotel also offers a number of suites equipped with a full kitchen, living room/dining area and two bedrooms so it is a hotel with a lot of options and worth checking out. We had a wonderful time and are already considering going back. I have passed on all my Ilikai information to my friends who want to visit Honolulu and who want to have a great place to stay. Staying at the Ilikai is a win, win situation.","Bridgewater, Canada","Linda M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bridgewater, Canada</strong>",157,5.0

We rented condo 526 from VRBO.com, at $300US per night excl taxes. 526 is a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom corner unit in the tower closest to the Hilton. The condo was spacious and well appointed - the kitchen contains a big oven and cook top, a big microwave and a ginormous ice making fridge. The ensuite bathroom has two sinks, one toilet and a shower over bath, while the other bathroom one sink, toilet and big shower. There is a lot of storage in the condo - perfect for keeping all that shopping out of the way! The condo also features a huge dining table and a super comfy couch and lanai furniture. There are tvs in the master bedroom and one in the lounge too which can be seen from the second room if you twist it round a bit.Our only mild annoyances are the air con, which makes quite a clunk when it switches itself off and on, and the two single beds were super squeaky ... You'd try not to move in the night so you wouldn't wake your roommate up! The Ilikai is in an awesome location (8 mins walk to Ala Moana and 12 mins into Waikiki proper, and 5 mins to the beach in front of the Hilton, 3 mins to the lagoon which was cold and full of small fish!) and the pool was just right - not crowded with random strangers right up close! Having now stayed at the Aqua Bamboo, the Pacific Monarch, the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and the Ilikai I would go back to the Ilikai at the drop of a hat, and would recommend it over the other hotels because of its atmosphere and comparable value for space.

We had great views from the apartment, it was well fitted out. the bar downstairs was very well priced, local beers $3, cocktails $7 and snack/meals were very well priced.

Check in was smooth with a friendly guy called rod behind the counter. When we got to our room we discovered a nice water feature in our bathroom mainly caused by a fellow resident upstairs not turning off a tap. We contacted reception and got a new room within 5 minutes. Our new room consisted of a very comfortable bed, sofa and a little kitchen and was seaview. We had food in the restaurant downstairs and I thought the quality was good even though it would be your typical resort bar menu. As in previous reviews this hotel was considered dated and we would have to agree. The hotels claim to fame was that it was used in the opening credits of the original Hawaii five O. I think the only thing that has changed since then was the towels. However the staff are very friendly. For those who'd like a pizza, leave the hotel and enter the Hilton which is adjacent. There's a fantastic pizza restaurant as part of their complex, think its called pizza time,open till midnight. Did a great tour to pearl harbour, organised through viator. Tour guide was called nappy and made the tour very enjoyable. Nice shop in the complex to get newspapers, coffee etc. lovely lagoon within a minutes walk where you can get a paddle boat and relax for a while. When we arrived first we used the baggage lift from curb side to the foyer. This lift would really put you off as its fairly dirty and smelly.however it leads up to a very clean and spacious foyer. As I said earlier the hotel is dated but I think I would stay here again. If you like luxury I wouldn't stay here but if its a hotel with friendly staff and good location you're after, maybe consider the ilikai.","Cork, Ireland","IainMCork</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cork, Ireland</strong>",24,3.0

The location is great if you've had enough of Waikiki--still on the beach but not as crowded. For us, it is way better for getting to work. The bar & grill had good food & staff was nice. We also really liked the pool. We had a great view of the fireworks at the Hilton too! Having the lanai is so wonderful when you are looking out at the water!Day one did not go well, as they had an electrical fire & we had to evacuate. (from floor 25!). All was well, although they need a plan to evacuate older folks as it was very hard for them. The store closed because of this and we needed (wanted, I suppose) water. So we went to several vending machines that didn't work, finally receiving coke not water. We asked the front desk for water and a refund, but they said they couldn't do that. Front desk issues when I had to extend my husband's stay because of work. We are corporate members and she wouldn't really talk to me. My husband had to take care of it after a long day. I think she passed it on to the gentleman who finally helped us, and he had it all handled no problem.

The check-in ad check-out services were seamlessly easy and the folks at the Waikiki Marina Resort office were totally helpful (esp. Reggie an Nicole)Any of our questions were answered promptly, some of the great suggestions were offered (incl. places to see and eat)The room was clean, large enough and comfortable with enough dishes and kitchen utensils to work for us (it was jut my wife and I). The balcony (lanai) was not huge but spacious enough to sit comfortably and have a breakfast or lunch (we pretty much dined out every day)The view was ""partial ocean"" - would've been more if the Hilton Hawaiian Village next door dint built their latest addition tower couple of years ago (I guess stuff like that just cannot be helped); also could see part of the Marina (from which, as it turned out, The SS Minnow departed for that fateful ""3-hour tour"") and the Duke K. Lagoon. On Tuesdays & Friday cold see the fireworks next door, however not fully (much better off just walk to the lagoon). And the roof of the 2nd floor was a bit too close but, again, things could be worse :)The room is cleaned 2 times a week - a full cleanup on Mondays and a partial (change towels refresh-type) on Thursdays. Was always done efficiently.The common hallway area does look a bit warn out on that floor and could use a spruce up. First week we could smell ""something fishy"" as we were approaching our door (perhaps someone dropped their lunch or something in the hallway); by the 2nd one the smell was gone but the area around our door needed to be vacuumed rather badly (NO it as not us littering...LOL). A bit of a nuisance but nothing to put damper on the overall experience We did park our car using the valet parking. That is a HUGE expense (at $28.00\day + the tip every time the car is brought back) but to some extend I dint have to worry about anyone breaking into a rental car (I heard stories GALORE from both tourists and locals incl. warnings from the rental car agent and the staff at the hotel) if I parked it somewhere else and the guys were very efficient taking the car and bringing it out (never had to wait more than 5 mins for I).On a retrospect - probably would not rent a car for the whole duration of the stay next time but that is a different topic all together.The restaurants on premises are excellent - ate at both Sarentos and Ilikai Bar & Grill as well as the café for breakfast; that said - tons and tons of eating options literally within walking distance!The shops seem adequate enough but we hardly paid them any mind - checked couple of things but didn't buy anything; but they are there if need be. That said - ABC STORES is next door (kind of a oversized 7-11 if you will) with plenty of all kinds stuff at very reasonable pricesNice terrace out back with cute little garden full of various flowers (lots of modeling and wedding photo shoot sessions here and at the beach) The pool is small but seem to be just the right size as it was never crowded. Immaculately clean with pool attendant on site and plenty of towels. For those who want to do laps - morning hours are ""reserved"" otherwise just relax and enjoy (the concrete does get HOT come mid-afternoon though)The location is very good - took us less than 10 mins to walk out back to the nearest beach area; about the same to walk to Ala Moana Mall; you can walk to any part of Waikiki downtown (and even Historic Honolulu if so chose) and driving to and fro was very easy.The only slight disappointment was not to find any original Hawaii Five-O memorabilia (although we were told that it was ""around""). The only thing connected to the series is a ""Chin Ho"" tree in the back courtyard\terrace but then - it is more of a tribute to the original ownerI would not hesitate to come back to Ilikai I the future!!!!",US,"CWBuff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>US</strong>",96,4.0

Check in was seamless as we just went to the room and entered a 4 digit # into the keypad. Great not having to deal with a key/ card for whole vacation.We didn't have a car so didn't use the parking - we used pre booked taxi from Airport (A8 Taxi - $35). Return to airport using shuttle $22 (VIP). Recommend both, great service.Apartment is good sized with full kitchen. Bathroom good sized with fantastic tiled shower. Room overlooks the lagoon so fireworks show was perfect from the lanai (very good sized as well). take a look at the web page for all the details and pictures: http://hawaiivacationpropertiesllc.com/vrp/rentals/i-5jm1.htmService was fantastic as the few issues we had were dealt to quickly. Room has wifi as well (end of our stay there was an outage for a bit and after that the service was spotty but still a nice feature). Flatscreen TV, good size, with lots of channels and dvd player.Main benefit of this place is it is close to everything - car rentals just across the street, Ala Moana is 10 minute walk, beach is 5 minute walk, key bus stops right out front, 15 minute walk to downtown Waikiki, next to Hilton, close to ABC store (what isn't), cafes, etc.We've stayed at Aqua Palms just across the road in the past and while this room was a bit more, it was bigger and the kitchen is a bonus. downsides: the room is just above some fans, ducting units out back (not sure what for) so it was a touch loud with the door to the deck open. Also, the AC unit is a bit loud until we finally got used to it. Ilikai hallways don't seem to have AC either so can get a touch warm when carting luggage.In all we'll probably stay here again (or maybe look for a unit a bit higher up).

Doug the owner was excellent to deal with always answering our emails promptly with any questions I had before I arrived. The Condo was clean and a very good size for the two of us. Our unit was on the 9th floor facing the ocean and Hilton Lagoon. The location was perfect close to the best beach not too crowded. When going to the beach the best part for entering the water which was all sand was closer to the Hilton's boat dock or pier. If you decide to sit closer to the the break water there are a few rocks and coral which is a little hard on the feet if you don't have water shoes. The king size bed was very comfortable, the view from the balcony was awesome and was the best spot for morning coffee and evening wine.The Condo was equipped with a kitchen with all cooking utensils although we only had our breakfast here as we were always away during the day enjoying the fantastic beach or exploring the island. The building has free WIFI which was a great way to communicate to family and friends back home. There are several places to eat lunch on or near the beach but my favorite was a 5 minute walk down the beach to the Steak Shack see my review.The Illikai Bar and Grill has some good food and drinks and very reasonable prices too compared to other places in Waikiki. The friendly service of the bartenders and waitresses was excellent. We ate here 3 or 4 times and enjoyed the outdoor atmosphere with live traditional Hawaiian music and dancers on Friday night too. There is also a fine dining option in the building located on the top floor Sarentos. We did not eat here but the menu looked good. We ate twice at the mall as they have a massive selection of restaurants in there food court. The prices are very reasonable here for a meal . We took The Bus $2.50 pp return to Diamond Head for a hike and the view was amazing, be sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring water. There is coffee shop in the lobby which serves great coffee and snacks as well which was very good. The store in the lobby is quite expensive in my opinion, try walking across the street to the ABC store for better prices and if you have more time go to the Foodland store in the mall about a 10 minute walk away to the left of the front entrance for the best prices on food. There was snorkeling gear, beach chairs/mats, floaties and beach toys in the closet and a beach bag which was a bonus as we had forgot to pack one. The building itself looks a bit dated or older from the outside but it is freshly painted and immaculately clean and I believe the lobby area was recently renovated. The pool was nice at the end of the day on the beach to get the sand and salt off. We seen the fireworks on Friday night from the balcony and as advertised the view was spectacular. The fireworks are two times a week now Tuesday and Friday's. We rented a car one day from the airport and parked at the marina for $1/ hour which is cheaper than the valet parking at the hotel. The Illikai was about a 15/20 minute stroll down into the heart of Waikiki and was nice in the evening with all the torches lit. You can walk either the street or the beach route. I thought the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful when I asked them any questions. Overall the place was perfect for us and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Waikiki.

I wore ear plugs but still very noisy & using air con at night was a total no no because of noise. If I stayed here again I would DEFINITELY go for a room overlooking beach/lagoon & would recommend other people do this unless you are one of those lucky people who can sleep anywhere/anytime. Pool area was nice, lovely deep pool - did get pretty busy at times. Bar/grill was good for drink/lunch.This was by far the most reasonably priced and as we were in Hawaii for two weeks we needed to make the budget stretch a bit further. The location is good on beach/harbour, about a 15-20 minute walk to town - really nice walk at sunset along the beach, trolley bus also stops outside - 2USD trip one way to town.

Someone else in the elevator was changing hotels because his rate was increased by $100 - not sure over how many days.

Cost around the same as a basic Hilton room, but we got early check in (our flight from Sydney arrived very early in morning) included, and had benefit of kitchenette and view. The condo's a little larger than a large hotel room. We enjoyed the downstairs grill restaurant, well priced and good food, and mini supermarket plus cafe. The condo was well kitted out, with everything you needed including boogie boards and beach toys for kids, but the lounge/bed for our kids was just adequate - if our kids had been a little older (they're 11 and 7 years old) it may have been pushing it in terms of comfort and size. Under that age it's fine. The convenience of going straight up to our condo on arrival, and using the key pad to get in (no check in queue), was a big plus for us. Communication prior to arrival was excellent. THe location was great, with the beach and lagoon close by, not that we spent much time there (lagoon/beach hygiene??!!), and you easily can hire a car for the day from any of the outlets across the road, saving you money (you pay a bomb in Hawaii to park your car over night - it's cheaper to hire a car in the morning and return it in the evening). Everything's in easy walking distance. If you're there on a Friday night, be sure and go to the lagoon to see the weekly fireworks put on by the Hilton as you can't see them from the Ilikai.

The Illikai Hotel is a great find. We were looking for inexpensive and close to the Kahanamouku Lagoon. This hotel fit the bill. We stayed in the ""Shell Resort"" side of the hotel. The hotel is split with one wing private residences/time share the other a true Hotel with front desk. We had to go to the 2nd floor to ""check in"" and everything was waiting as promised. We had 2 rooms for 8 family members, including 3 babies. The check in was seamless and the welcome packet was a nice touch. The room was bright, clean and spacious. The maid service refreshed our towels daily. The kitchenette was Spartan with minimal cookware, however, we made it work. The room faced Ala Moana Blvd, therefore sitting on the lanai to read or check email was ridiculous due to the traffic noise. With the sliding door shut, the noise was al but gone. The hotel halls were NOT air conditioned, so it felt like a sauna walking from the elevator to the room. Being built in 1964, Illikai was the first high rise on Waikiki and is dated. To their credit, the building has been well maintained and is in the process of a floor by floor renovation. Brandon at the help desk was amazing, thank you. There are two pools, one for each side of the hotel. They will throw you out of the ""Hotel Side"" if you mistakenly wander into ""their"" pool. ( which I did with my grandson. It was quite embarrassing). The hotel is ideally located at the end of Waikiki, walking distance to the Ala Moana Shopping Center, which has great restaurants and shops a plenty. ""The Bus"", Honolulu's rapid transit is great and will take you to just about anywhere in Honolulu you want to go. Bandon, at the help desk, will plot your rout and tell you where to catch the bus. He was right on when we did the Diamond Head State Park tour ( see review).Hints: Fire works are at the Kahanamouku Lagoon ( By Hilton Vacation Village) just steps from the Illikai each Friday and Wednesday evening at 7:45 and 8:00PM respectively. Quite a nice free event, I must say.Buy eggs and breakfast items at the ABC Superette directly across the street. Bring a Zip Lock baggie of your favorite coffee and #4 filters. There is a coffee maker in the room and making your own breakfast will save you time and a truck load of cash so you can spend more on attractions.Almost every event/attraction is available within walking distance: snorkeling trip, paddle boarding, surfing, surfing lessons, sunset dinner cruises, ( recommend doing one) etc. Again see Brandon at the help desk in the lobby. Rent a car. YOU DO NOT NEED ONE. Get a shuttle from the airport or pay $37.00 for the taxi ride. ( we choose a taxi as it is more personal and less hassle). If you want to drive the island ( which takes one day) rent a car from the place on Kalakaua Ave & Ala Moana Blvd, which is walking distance from the hotel.Polynesian Cultural Center. We have gone there and found it to be a waste of a full day. It is an extension of Brigham Young University and by the end of the day, you will never, EVER want to say ""Aloha"" again. Having said that, if you have an extra day to blow, then consider it. we prefer to grab a few towels from ABC store and hang out at the North Shore. We are already planning another stay at Illikai, but will definitely ask for an ocean view and pay a few more scoots to be able to drink coffee on the lanai in the morning, in peace.","Santa Clarita, California","Mauisron</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Clarita, California</strong>",93,4.0

The pub grub style food served at the ""grownup's"" pool and at the burger bar adjacent to the lobby were decent, as was the bar service at the ""grownup"" pool. The Shell condo did not provide beach towels. We were asked to use the white bath towels from the unit whenever we went to the beach. Needless to say they got amazingly dirty. Most hated, though, was the $28 per day mandatory valet charge (plus an extra $2-$4 per day in valet tips). Slow, pointless and overpriced. We were on the street side. Traffic was VERY noisy.

Our flight arrived in Honolulu in the late evening. So we told them we should be in the unit by 11:00 pm. We understood that the normal check out time was 11:00 am. So this unit should be vacant and be available for professional cleaning all day (I stressed Professional cleaning). Since we arrived so late at night with very tired young kids, I didn't really go looking around to check out the unit. Just wanted to get the kids off the bed. I will come back to the 'bed' later. When I did have a chance to look around in the morning, this was what I found...The kitchen had the basic that we had expected. But some of the dishes, cutleries, pots and pans were dirty. And the dishwasher was broken. A note was left on the counter to inform us not to use it and that the owner was informed of the situation. A couple of days later, some one (didn't really know who that was) came by to check out the dishwasher and said would return later to replace it and that we did not need to be there when they return to do so. Well, we were not happy with the idea that some strangers would be in the unit while we were not there and we did not want to waste our vacation time to sit and wait for them. Anyways, no one had ever came back to replace it. I had gotten used to hand washing everything. I also made sure no open food packages around the counter as I had already killed two cockcroaches. I knew it was to be expected in old buildings but YUCK. Thank goodness my kids never saw them! Both times was in the dark bathroom. Not something I wanted to see. Yes, I know we were in a tropical place and that it was normal but the unit had cracks in some corners of the bathroom and the area under the sink was not pleasant. The bathroom could definitely use some updates. There were not enough bath towels to go around. But that was why there was laundry facility down the hall. Bring your own soap. I brought samples from home. The photos on the website were pretty accurate. We knew it was out dated. When they are ready to update in the future, a bath tub with a hand held shower head would be nice. The kids would prefer a tub instead of just a shower. The floors were still dirty from the previous guests. The area under the sofa and the dining table were so dusty and covered with food particles. On the memo left on the kitchen counter, it said if we wanted a cleaning done during our stay, the cost would be $ 50. What!!! I just got the vacuum out and just cleaned up myself. The sofa bed was not acceptable. Good thing my twins are too little to care. The mattress was very bumpy. It would not laid flat. No adults would accept that. I swear that sofa bed was never replaced from day one. There was one good point through all of this. The ocean view was great. We could see the luau on the roof top at the Hilton. It was on a few times. Can't remember which days of the week. We saw the fireworks from the Hilton instead. The other building in front of us blocks the view (and they could look into our unit). We had a few meals on the balcony. Just had to make sure the kids were not so close to the railings. A bit scary. We didn't dealing with the hotel staff as this was a private condo rental. So I couldn't comment on them. Only that if you were to leave your bags with the bell staff after you have checked out, the cost was $1 per bag. We only rented a car for one day and did the drive to the North Shore. But didn't realize that on Sundays, some places are not open. We had wanted to check out a few restaurants that were not within the Waikiki area, but they were closed. Too bad. But a must stop for shave ice at Matsumoto was so yummy. Tried the Green tea special. So good! As for the parking, the rental car (Enterprise) agency had hinted that the marina parking may not be safe therefore, parking at the parking lot (gated) at the Red Lobster would be better. If you want to prepaid, $7 would buy you 10 hours. And after that, I think it was $4 per half hour. So that option did not work for us. We ended up paying $20. All in all, the vacation was good, just wish the stay in the actual room was nicer.","Vancouver, Canada","twinmom01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",13,3.0

They finally sorted out our room at 8pm and gave us a free night at our request. The room itself was tired looking due to the 80s fittings (we later learnt the Ilikai is the oldest high rise in Waikiki) and the balcony is not for the faint hearted. For those who suffer panic attacks and vertigo, highly unrecommended. Having said this, the location was great for shuttle pick ups and there is waikiki beach just outside.

Invest the extra few dollars (and it really isnt that much more) for an Ocean View room - the scenery is superb. The pool is a decent size and the lagoon directly at the bottom (shared with the Hilton Hawaiin Village) is superb. There is soft grass to lay on as well as sand.

The staff was very helpful and attentive during our stay and it's location is exceptional for the price. With 5 of us (2 adults, 3 kids), we stayed in a 2-bedroom suite that met all of our needs. Great views of the Waikiki area, kitchen, laundry services, and easy beach/lagoon access made it the perfect place for us to stay and play. Additionally, there was no reason for a car because of the great location. However, the real gem was the helpful staff. We booked the Ilikai for a day room from 8a to 8p the Saturday our cruise was over due to our flight leaving at 10:15p. It was very convenient and restful during the day, but turned out to be a God sent after our flight was cancelled and we were stranded in Honolulu Airport at 1:30a. After getting rebooked for the following day at noon, we didn't know what to do but possibly hole up in the airport until the next day. There were no rooms left in Honolulu due to a huge convention, but on a hope, I called the Ilikai. I explained the situation and hoped our day room was still just sitting there unoccupied. The staff on duty told us to come back immediately and we could certainly have our room back at no charge. The baggage handlers were there to greet us immediately at nearly 2am and our keys were waiting for us at the front desk. Within 5 minutes of arriving at the hotel, we were settled in our room for the night. With customer service like this, I can't recommend the Ilikai enough if you are planning on vacationing in Waikiki.","Columbus, Ohio","John G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",10,5.0

Plus, the room was updated and bright and at least 600 square feet. It included a microwave, refrigerator and even a wine opener. The lobby was beautiful, unlike the Hyatt's which is located in a shopping mall with no real lobby and not much of a pool. While the Ilikai's pool isn't very big either you are adjacent to the Hale Koa and with your military i.d. they will let you into any of their pools.

MCDonalds out front left and across the street and Starbucks out front right in the Hilton Hawaiian 530am to 7pm. good sights are iolani palace (about 30 minute stroll from ala moana) and the zoo (30 minute stroll through waikiki) or you can get bus/trolley/taxi - aquarium and sea life park both disappointing. would definitely stay at ilikai again!","CHESHIRE, UK","PARENTWITHKIDS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>CHESHIRE, UK</strong>",87,5.0

I have been to Hawaii several times and this was the most disappointing hotel I have been in. It started when we checked in. They did not have the type of room I had reserved so they gave us a roll away and jammed it between the bed and the wall. It made the room crowded and the beds hard to get in and out of. We were greeted by a very large - well over an inch - cockroach in the kitchen, yuck! And the room was old and out dated. The cabinets in the kitchen and bathroom were old painted wood which were sticky and dirty from years of use. The carpet was worn and dirty as well. The air conditioning unit was so load my husband asked me if it was a jack hammer when we were talking on the phone. So much for the room. The hotel is on the marina - not on the beach. It is a bit of a walk, not a bad walk, but don't think that you will be ""on the beach"". The hotel staff is nice but not professional, I called down for the car, as I was running short on time, but when I got there they hadn't even begun to go get it. The porter and front desk did not talk to one another so baggage instructions were messed up. The valet guys held my door for me, but never helped with luggage. I am happy to tip when someone helps me and makes my day a little easier because I appreciate the effort. But I don't like it when they do the bare minimum and then expect a tip - I paid a lot for parking, $28/night.My final complaint about this property is that it does not have a hospitality suite for travelers with a late flight. I have been to Hawaii several times and this is the first time that this service was not provided.We were there with a group - everyone else in the group had bright new rooms that had been upgraded.....be extra sure you get one of those!","Rolling Hills Estates, California","ShellyZ151</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rolling Hills Estates, California</strong>",32,2.0

Search for it on Amazon – it gives you lots of tips and information about Oahu.The trip was pleasant but the first few hours were a little stressful. This unit uses the Schlag electronic lock and the combination on the check-in document was incorrect, or the battery in the lock was ‘dying’. Thanks goodness for the house cleaner, Ala, who walked by the room just as we tried to enter the unit. She was nice enough to assist us in opening the door. Once we opened the door, we were stunned to see the room was a mess. The unit was not clean. Again, Ala contacted the house cleaning department and they sorted everything out within 2 hours. We left our bags in the unit and took a drive down Waikiki. When we returned, the room was almost perfect. Plus, the view from the balcony was awesome, exactly as the pictures described it on the website. The building itself was decent but a little dated. The elevators were clunky but it worked. The room was upgraded but the balcony sliding doors definitely needed some work. It was not easy to slide the doors back and forth, and it was squeaky. We rented a SUV (Chevy Traverse) and paid $28/night for valet parking with ‘in and out’ privileges. Valet parking was definitely pricy but absolutely worth it if you plan on renting a car. The valet drivers were really nice and friendly too. Don’t even think about trying to find parking on the streets or metered parking. You will probably stress yourself out and ruin your entire trip. The other option is to park in the first building west of the ilikai – that is the left side when you exit the main ilikai entrance on Ala Moana Blvd. By the way, we rented our car from JN rental for $777/wk. The cost included taxes, fees, and basic insurance coverage. JN rental will pick you up and drop you off at the airport too. With 8 people in our party, it was like herding cows. Therefore, we felt it was cheaper to rent an 8 person SUV versus a 7 person van. Driving around Waikiki is not as difficult and others had described. It’s really no different to driving in a big US city. The biggest tip is to ensure you have Google maps going whenever you are in the vehicle, AND be sure you have an attentive co-pilot - super important.Meals - this is one area we lacked in our plan. There are lots of restaurants but we struggled every night to find a decent place. All I can say is stay away from Makittii buffet and don’t get sucked in when you see their coupon. Their ‘seafood’ buffet is abysmal, horrible and terrible. The food is lukewarm, horrible sushi – just nasty stuff. If you want to relax with a drink in your hand and sit in a comfortable place, go to the Shore Bird at the Outrigger Reef. It is super relaxing and the Mai Tais are $3.50 during happy hour. Btw, happy hour starts at noon!Tours - we did the Dole tour – interesting and pleasant. Awesome pineapple ice cream and great gift shop.Pearl Harbor was great and touching. If you do plan to visit this location, get your tickets online at least 4 to 5 months BEFORE your tip. Otherwise, your options are to be at the Pearl Harbor visitor center BEFORE 7am and pay $7.50/person for the USS Arizona tour. It is a self-guided audio tour. The last option is to buy a Pearl Harbor tour packages at your hotel or one of the ExpediaTours desk. Be sure to ask for the guided USS Missouri. ** One important tip about self guided tours – get to your destination early.All in all we had an awesome trip.","San Diego, California","ctheseira</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",3,4.0

We loved our stay! We arrived on the 5th of June at 12pm and the room was ready and waiting for us to move in. The view was absolutely amazing, we overlooked the lagoon and the ocean, and also had a view of the city. The room was very clean and comfortable. We hired a cot and toddler bed through paradise baby, which were delivered shorty after we arrived. It was very cosy with the four of us, however there is plenty of storage space for clothes and toys so we did not feel at all cramped during our stay. The condo comes equipped with beach chairs, snorkels, blow up beach toys, beach towels and lots of other items that made the stay that much more relaxing. The door to the balcony had a very secure and child proof lock that was very reassuring. We were a 10 minute walk to Ala Moana shopping centre, which had a very reasonably priced grocery store, as we found the ABC store too expensive. We had some very nice meals and the ilikai bar and grill which is just down below the hotel. The lagoon is a 5 minute walk away, we found it perfect to swim here with two small children. Our room was in a perfect position to view the friday night fireworks. There is a small playground just 10 minutes walk down the boardwalk that my 2 year old enjoyed playing on. It is about a 15-20 minute walk to Waikiki with the kids in a stroller. The owners of the condo were very friendly during the lead up to our stay, they replied to our emails promptly and provided us with helpful advice to make our stay more enjoyable. I would also recommend going to the discovery centre if you have children and want to give them a day out of the sun. It is fantastic for kids. It is a short taxi ride from the ilikai. If I am lucky enough to go back to Hawaii, I would choose to stay in this condo again.",Newcastle,"amy2203</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle</strong>",2,5.0

This building has both hotel rooms and privately owned condos for rent and we opted for this condo found through Waikiki Beach Rentals. The unit appeared just as presented in the photos and was even more spacious than shown. It was very clean, bright, open and ready for our week's stay. The view is AMAZING and the location was exceptional. It is at the quieter north end of Waikiki beach, which was just fine for us - we walked or could take the trolley to the center of Waikiki for shopping when we wanted. You can get to the beach in just a couple of minutes walk from your room and the beach in front of the hotel/lagoon was much less crowded than other places. The Friday night fireworks are literally right out the balcony. I rated the sleep quality average because the beds are not the most comfortable, but there was certainly amply space to sleep our family of 5 and there was lots of closet space.

Our ocean front room on the top 25th floor had absolutely gorgeous views of the beach and marina. It was spacious, airy and clean. The beds were very comfy. The child friendly lagoon beach is just a few mins walk from the hotel. The kids loved this beach just right beside Hilton Hawaiian because there was no large waves and the water was fairly shallow at most places with tiny fishes swimming around. Just opposite the hotel are lots of food eateries, very convenient. The hotel pool is heated and is crowded on weekends. There was an unpleasant encounter with one of the regular pool users from the apartments that share the pool. We got into the pool at 8.30am( by our watch time), not knowing that the pool clock showed 8.25am. There were only 2 ladies using the pool at the time. This lady in her 60's went up to my 8 year old who was in the water and told her off saying hotel guests were only allowed to use the pool after 8.30am! Luckily the pool management staff David was very nice and smoothed things over. Other than that, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend this hotel to families with young children.","Singapore, Singapore","jjleemili</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",9,4.0

Few other restaurants in walking distance particularly liked the OUTBACK a couple of doors away. Hawaiian Village hotel next door had Luah's most night on the roof of their car park which we could also see from our balcony so we enjoyed a free show.

There are also 2 other lines which go to the outskirts of Waikiki .Buses - fare is $2.50 how ever far you ride and hotel gave us a list of bus nos and their destinations.

The pool is older, but well kept and quite quiet. There are two or three condo owners who put their towels on the chairs under the only permanent canopy each morning hours before they arrive and then when they finally arrive the two or three older women run to the attendant every time someone jumps gently into the pool, leans on the divider rope or brings a floaty into the pool, yet two of the three women have floaties. They are relentless and talk loudly about ""the Guests"". They made sitting by the pool uncomfortable and unenjoyable. I watched dozens of people leave each day because they were basically run out of the pool because of these condo owners. I have never seen such militant pool rules. These women should realize that their unwelcoming and rude behavior is discouraging people from returning to this hotel. We spoke to dozens of guests who were very upset about this. We felt horrible for the pool attendants who had to enforce such silly rules.

This condo also has views of the Friday night fireworks.The double beds sit in wooden bases that stick out quite close to the storage unit so you have to be careful not to smash your legs on the corners.Our nine-year-old son slept on the sofa (extra sheets and a rug were supplied) but you probably wouldn’t want a child much older than 9 or 10 trying to sleep on it for a week.There’s not much room to swing a cat or store bags but the stack cane baskets in the dividing storage unit between the lounge/sleep areas provided just enough space for all four family members to store essential clothes.The writing desk had a good assortment of pop up power plugs – far better than many business hotels.The kitchen was well equipped with coffee maker, kettle, toaster, even a rice cooker. We mostly used it for cooking breakfast and reheating leftovers.When we arrived the bench was set with placemat, crockery etc for two. There were plenty of plates and cutlery but the glasses were a bit light on, topped up by assorted plastic tumblers.There are coin operated laundries on each floor and most helpfully a laundry basket was in the wardrobe. A clothes airing rack for the lanai/balcony would have been handy.The bathroom vanity extends over the toilet so keep the lid down to avoid accidentally knocking items in :-) Our bathroom only had a shower but our friends' near identical condo had a shower over a bath.Towels were supplied for four but there were only two beach towels. Our friends who also booked to stay at the same time noticed this also. Luckily pool towels were supplied by the pool; you receive passes when you arrive and names are left with the attendants.We didn’t use the pool much – not when the Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon is a quick walk from the hotel. This is a great place to spent the day swimming or hiring a paddle boat or stand-up paddle board. There are ABC convenience stores located nearby but the Ilikai’s own general store on the ground floor also had all the essentials from fruit and ice creams to beach mats and bottled water at reasonable prices.The massive Ala Moana shopping mall is about a 10-15 minute walk away and has an amazing food court with every cuisine under the sun.Free wi-fi and free local and US calls were included with our rental. Our understanding was all condos were non-smoking yet each morning we discovered ash on our lanai which was a bit of a nuisance to clean up.The condos are a great, economical option for families and those who don’t want the pressure of having to leave a hotel by a set time each day so they can make the beds.

We reserved the Ocean View Two Bedroom Suite (#2410) on the 24th floor. When we walked in, all our jaws dropped as we saw the enormous and excellent views from the suite... views overlooking the marina, beach, partial lagoon, the city, and Ala Moana Beach and Park!We have been to Hawaii over a dozen times, and we all feel this was the best hotel we've ever stayed at. And the location is very very peaceful and quiet with access to the lagoon and beach, and Ala Moana Shopping center in just a few minutes walking distance. Perfect if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle noise of Waikiki.First, check-in at the front desk was really fast. The man who helped us was very friendly and he even showed my 2 year old nephew the ""hang loose"" hand sign and he has been doing and saying it ever since! Lol.The elevators are fast and you reach the uppers floors in no time. Even as an older hotel, it is very updated with and we were very impressed. The rooms were very quiet and the suite was large enough for the four of us. It had a half kitchen with a nook, microwave, four stove burners, half fridge, dishes, cups, a sink, and small dining room table with chairs. The suite has two bathrooms, and two separate rooms, one with two beds (very comfortable), and another with a king size bed where mom slept (she said was it extremely comfortable, the best ever!) and had access to one of the 2 balconies. Yes, it has two large balconies! We were at first nervous since we were so high up and having my 2 year old nephew we knew we would have to keep all the doors to the balconies closed that week and just rely on the air conditioning, which worked out just fine as it was so humid and hot that week. I did notice that the front balcony had a metal pin lock that was out of reach for young children, but unfortunately, it was damaged and would not lock. There was one early evening my mother, nephew, and I were in the living room part of the suite, and his mother sat out on the balcony. She closed the heavy sliding glass door behind her, but was still aware and was watching him on the inside. But, unbeknownst to my mother and I... a few seconds later, my nephew was gone in a flash, I ran over to the balcony and he was sitting on his mother's lap outside. My sister saw that he had managed to open the heavy sliding glass door within a few seconds by all by himself. Really scary! And even more scary is the fact that small children can fit through the bars of both balconies.So I hope Iliaki hotel management reads this and fixes the pin locks on the balcony door and to all balconies on the rest of the floors for child safety.The housekeeping was so friendly and they cleaned the room each day around noon, sometimes 1:30 pm at the latest. My mother and sister wanted me to mention to hotel that they did have problem with the dust in the room. They kept sneezing on certain days while in the room and noticed the furniture was dusty, especially the couch, curtains, and chairs, and quite possibly the air conditioning vents may have been dusty inside as well.But, all in all, we really enjoyed this suite and hotel and the breathtaking views!

NOTE: Updated floor tiling from entrance, kitchen into bathroom is pretty but SHINY, just a bit of water spots on tile and you will go flying ie placed small rectangle towel floor mat in front of toilet to step out of shower, took one step onto floor tile and slipped like a banana peel falling backwards smacking arm on corner of shower stall tile (broke skin bruised) and hitting other arm on toilet on way down!!! We were extremely careful on tile rest of stay, husband slipped in kitchen after doing dishes, there is NO sink rug. We have rented condos and houses all over Hawaiian islands and never experienced such a boobie trapped unit.Suggestions: Replace bathroom sink mirror for sure with actual glass! Replace can opener in kitchen it doesn't work. You could treat your renters to a better quality of an actual set of pots and pans (not odd pieces of college student quality), a decent set of matching silverware (again odds and ends). Might as well buy set of 4 glasses and 4 wine glasses while you are treating your guests after all there is NO dishwasher! We can tell you how to get to Kmart... Also, how about leaving some extra paper products and cleaning items in case first thing guests don't want to do is run to store! An extra set of sheets left on top shelf of closet for mid week change would be most welcome!!! Oh yes, we have NEVER seen such SMALL pillows in our lives, our children may have used toddler sized pillows at one time!!! Get a new mattress if you insist on using that deadly platform our backs were killing us. We wanted to move the couch toward tv to move basket shelves to give us more walking space between platform, it's a good idea! You usually rent to couples, so why only one luggage rack, wouldn't two luggage racks make sense, at least?!?After telling the reality of functionality of unit, it is remodeled, rest of unit was clean ie no dust, sticky ? left behind any where, rug clean, tile shiny clean, lanai table and decking clean. Unit #1539 is one unit removed from end of leg on Y shaped building, therefore closest to ocean and more private lanai from rest of building. Being toward end allows unobstructed views from other buildings for gorgeous sunsets and views of harbor and beaches West. The rental studios at Ilikai are actually the best price for generally being remodeled with lovely views $!We enjoyed the location of Ilikai building which is at beginning of downtown allowing easy walk to Ala Moana Shopping Center, lots of restaurants, easy walking access to beaches (East & West). We loved the smiling friendly valet staff and the easy wide covered drive up entrance! There is small grocery store on main level, restaurant/bar and few shops. Liked the beautiful tables/chairs/umbrellas garden courtyard with view to Ala Wai Harbor to ocean and can sit there for Friday fireworks if you have West facing condo.","Chicago, Illinois","Tredpositive</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",81,3.0

Site excellent and booking very easy and painless. Good communication from manager of site and always kept up to date with what happening, all instructions and regular emails. This is great when booking from overseas. When it comes to these units you need to book early as the best are booked first. This wasn't our first choice but it was ok in the end. We stayed in a 2 BR, 2Bath unit and the second bedroom had a full proper dividing wall.The Good: Location, very easy to get to, Waikiki Trolley and all tour coaches pull up outside The Ilikai. Easy walking distance to Waikiki central, the beach, Hilton Village for shopping, ABC stores and other amenity store on site, able to walk to Ala Moana but may want to bus or taxi back with bags of shopping etc.Beds extremely comfortable and had very good restful nights sleep there. Minimal noise heard from traffic and outside. Bed linen average.Excellent supply of towels and beach towels. TV's large and in the three main rooms, reception good and cable tv.View from balcony fabulous of the ocean, Hilton lagoon and fireworks that were on both Friday and Saturday night. Able to see the performance on the Hilton rooftop nightly as well.Very well cleaned priot to our arrivalLanai furniture excellent able to eat out there and rest and look at the view from diferent areas on the balcony.Everything there need for self containment and making meals, be prepared for everything to revolve around drinking coffee and not tea.Had one maintenance issue and Bert arrived promptly to sort us out.We arrived early from Australia and we had pleasantly been allowed in the room early, rooms have codes not keys so very good not having to think about keys at the beach or losing them. Codes changed between guests of course.Easy walking to beach and restaurants nearby. Very good hairdryer provided in room.Free wi-fi, nil issues with this at all, connected immediately with no drop out or problems. Phone in room with local free calls.Laundry facilities on each floor.The average: The decor was very dated in our eyes with the wall paintwork scuffed.The photos were true to what you get but much dated in real life. Minor but a bit disappointing.The bad:The airconditioning was nothing like what we are used to as in window units and seemed unable to cope with the temperature. Relied heavily on the 3 ceiling fans as well, This is part of the building being old and each unit needing its own air con and no ducted being available. The bathrooms were very dated in our experience and even though very clean still were the biggest let down. Overall we enjoyed our stay in the unit as the view, location and beds made up for any disappointment.","Launceston, Australia","GingerRose63</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Launceston, Australia</strong>",167,4.0

It has changed a bit, but the good things are still the same. The stairs up to the lobby with the water features invite you in from the beginning, leading to the spacious open lobby looking out through gardens to the boat harbour. Throughout ground level are found the shops, cafe, bar/restaurant and post office with the walkway at the far end leading to the lagoon and Waikiki itself. A cool and comfortable breeze sweeps through all of this, and with the roomy lounge chairs throughout, it is a pleasant place just to sit and read. Our room on the 22nd floor had magnificent views of the lagoon, ocean and beach (as well as the rooftop Luau at the adjoining Hilton each night!). The full glass doors opened right up onto the balcony, which was not too windy and a great spot for having a drink a bite to eat. We chose a room with a kitchenette, which was handy for breakfast and lunch if we weren't out and about. Decor and furnishings were comfortable and contemporary, and the bed very comfortable. The staff were all very considerate, pleasant and helpful. My son has very fond memories of Rob, on concierge and reception, who taught him the ""Hang Loose Owen"". Access to the in house pool and the beach was an easy stroll; the bar\reataurant had great meals and very reasonably priced drinks. The restaurant at the top of the hotel (worth the visit just for the ride in the external glass elevator) had magificent views of the city, beach, harbour and mountains with a menu and wine list to match. Service was excellent and the jazz was pretty cool too. The location of the Ilikai at the end of Waikiki is a plus. It's quiet at night but you are never far from the main action, or the great shopping at Ala Moana, a five minute walk away. Pleny of well priced bars, restaurants and shops can be found immediately surrounding the hotel. Tour buses and The Bus stop just outside the hotel. You can walk to the main part of Waikiki in ten to fifteen minutes if preferred. It's an easy hotel to navigate, and our 10 year old became quite comfortable in moving around on his own, changing beach towels at the lobby and posting letters in the post office. The Ilikai is one of the first ""big"" hotels form the 60's but retains a lovely contemporary and family friendly feel.

The hotel itself is located in a perfect spot with great ocean views and for the most part is well maintained. The condos, which are independently owned, reside within the hotel complex but are not managed by the hotel so the hotel services are not available. We rented from Dainora from Waikiki rentals based on pictures she sent us. When we got our instructions for how to access the unit we noticed the unit number was different from the one we signed in the contract. We didn't bring it up as we thought maybe the posting number and unit number were different, but when we arrived we were a bit disappointed as it looked nothing like the pictures but decided to stay and make the best of it. The bathroom was gross, worn and dated, the sliding doors didn't work very well and had no lock on them, thank goodness my husband had a padlock in his duffel bag. There was plenty of closet space and the bed seemed reasonably comfortable. We were traveling for three weeks so we decided to just unpack and relax and not stress out about it and intended to deal with it later. After we completely unpacked our 3 weeks of clothes we get a knock at our door from a coupe who said they were registered for this condo, when we both compared the emails we got from Dainora, they were the exact same email for the exact same unit. They contacted her by cell phone only to find out she was in CA! When we finally reached her she said there was a mistake and sent the other couple to a different unit. An hour later the couple came back and told us there was someone else in the new unit Dainora sent them to and that she was sending them to a third unit and that we should call her. When we called her we learned that the unit we were in 718, was supposed to be the other couple's condo and that she was putting them in our condo unit we were promised unit 1732 but we would have to move in two days!!! Needless to say we were just furious about having to pack up everything again to move in two days. We were there for a conference so it was going to be additionally inconvenient as we had a conference schedule to adhere to. Dainora offered to help us move and to work around our schedule but was unwilling to compensate us in any other way for the inconvenience, not even a dinner or gift car or anything. Her response was ""mistakes happen"". When we got to 1732 it was in fact the unit she had sent me pictures of and was a much nicer unit, but still not as nice as we thought, it sufficed. So the bottom line if you are going to rent a condo at Ilikai be careful who you rent from and make sure the pictures are current. Our trip otherwise was fun and we did enjoy the location which was very convenient to the Convention Center where our conference was being held.","Charlottesville, Virginia","FlowJo_12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charlottesville, Virginia</strong>",8,3.0

The staff were friendly and ready to be off assistance whenever needed. The room was very clean, and the housekeeping staff was sweet, but when we entered the room we were hit with the scent of some kind of deodorizer that irritated me after a bit.Generally, I would agree with other reviewers That the rooms are a bit dated, and while I can appreciate the wish to keep the historic integrity intact, I few more upgrades would not hurt. We also had a bit of an unpleasant surprise in learning upon arrival that unless you wanted to park in some public area, there was a $20.00 nightly valet service.

Renting through waikikibeachrentals was super easy and we had no problems at all during our stay. The condo itself was exactly as pictured and very clean, which is a priority with us. The bed was comfy, another priority. The bathroom was roomy and the shower worked well. We never cooked in but the kitchen had sufficient dishes, pans, etc if you wanted to. The condo was very quiet and we never heard noise from above or next door. We were mostly sight-seeing but did go to the pool one day just to relax. The lounge chairs had comfortable cushions and the beach towels provided were thick. We walked through the lobby of other hotels in Waikiki and much preferred the smaller, quiet lobby at the Ilikai. Good price for a condo in Waikiki as well. We would definitely recommend the Ilikai and specifically the condo we stayed in. We usually rent through vrbo but this rental agency had more units available. Their website made it very easy to make a reservation and I would recommend them as well.

Both times our experience there was excellent. All the rooms are on the upper floors. (The lower floors are condos). Both times we were on the 25th floor, which is above all the noise, has great views and 2 lanais. The rooms were spotless, the staff is friendly, everything works, and there is nothing negative to say. When I filled out the survey that the hotel does, the only suggestions I made were: more utensils in the kitchen (at checkout they told me that if I had called the front desk they would have sent more up) and the Concierge could have been more helpful. Other than that, everything was perfect. For me, one of the most important things is peace and quiet. We never heard another house guest the whole time we were there, and as mentioned, being up so high, if you keep the sliding doors to the lanais closed, noise from the street is very low. We had a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom suite for the 4 of us. The mattresses were very comfortable. The main room is much bigger than the other hotels that we looked at. The sofa was a pull-open bed, so we could have slept 2 more people. We were very satisfied and would definitely stay there again.

Overall it was a great experience. We checked in May 8th and left May 14th. We had a ocean view and they put us on the 25th floor, which gave us a beautiful view. The staff was super friendly and we did use the concierge downstairs to book a few excursions and we had them set us up with a rental car for a day. Them booking our car saved us around $50 for the car with Alamo, which is literally across the street. The cafe downstairs was pretty good for breakfast, I loved the Loco Moco!! Yummy!! We also ate one night at Sarentos at the top of the hotel, we both had the filet which was delicious and the view is beautiful from up there.The only 2 bad things was the shower had mold in it and the bed was hard as a rock, we had to take back ache pills nightly due to how hard it was. We stayed in a regular room, not a full condo and the room was a very nice size. The hotel is not right on the beach, it is a good walk so make sure you have all your stuff. The Hilton next door does rent umbrellas and lounge chairs for a fee but well worth it. If using cabs ask rates before you get in, they all have different rates. You can bargain with them, to go from the hotel to the mall should run $7 but the cab driver will say $10, but once you say you paid $7 they will lower the price.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We arrived around 10pm and were quickly greeted by the valet staff. They were always friendly and helpful. The reception check-in took under two minutes and we were off and away to our room. The carpets of the hotel are a bit worn out. They show their age, but nothing too much that distracts from the ""comfortable"" feel of the hotel. The lobby was open and spacious. It had a modern feel to with a throw-back to the 50's when the hotels were in their glory days. The lobby was clean pleasing to the eye. There were plenty of areas to sit in the expansive lobby and enjoy the breeze from the open lobby. It had a paradise feel to lobby which was quite welcoming. The room was clean, the chairs worn. Our chair looked like a cat had used the arm rests for a scratching post. The room was VERY large. We were on 22 floor. The view of the harbor and partial city was beautiful. The side we were on - which overlooked the Modern hotel's pool and the Ilikai's large patio was perfect for sunsets. The bed was comfortable, but the pillows lacked in quality - although they offered 7 on our bed. The bathroom had recently been remodeled and was fine. It was a tight fit with the door and a person using the toilet. The shower was very large and clean. The room also contained a desk, a dresser and two night stands and its only AC unit which was housed on the balcony. We enjoyed the large open balcony doors and preferred to keep them open than use the AC. Their lounge outside was reasonable priced and on the lower end of price ranges compared to other hotel's restaurants. They had some delicious drinks, but the hotel's bar/grill closed had their last call around pm. One of the downsides to Waikiki was that almost everything closed around this time. The hotel's pool was extremely small in comparison to the other hotels. Granted, this is more of an ""original"" hotel, the pool area could stand to be updated. It was clean however. The two down sides to the hotel were the walk to the beach. The walk was about 5-6 minutes to the actual beach, although it was closer to the man-made lagoon of the Hilton's. Carrying their chairs, towels and other beach supplies made it a long journey. We were pleased they offered towels and beach chairs. The other con was the smoking section at the hotel. The smoking section is placed right at the walkway to the beach access. You had to walk through puffs of disgusting smoke to enjoy the rest of the W.B. or to return to your hotel. It was really poor placement for this. It was also on the pool's wall side. If you did spend time at the pool, the cigarette smoke wafted into the pool area frequently. Poor planing for placement. The Ilikai is located at the very end of W.B.. For the amenities it lacked, it made up in price for a affordable vacation.","Rome, Italy","MassachusettsRes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rome, Italy</strong>",40,4.0

The staff were fantastic and they could not do enough for us. We were able to leave a considerable amount of our luggage with the hotel while we sailed on the Pride of America for a week. The luggage porter is a really nice guy and nothing was too much trouble. Laundry on each floor allowed us to do our washing and come home from holiday with suitcases of clean clothes what a change was that. All in all I would recommend this hotel for its proximity to everything. We walked to Ala Moana Shopping Centre, grabbed a shuttle to the international market place and could stroll to our choice of good restaurants.

The Ilikai has hotel rooms, time share units, and condos. Clint equipped the condo with nice furnishings and appliances...and more. My husband said several times, ""He's really detail-oriented."" Clint thinks of things his guests may need and provides them. He also responded quickly to questions and went above and beyond by telling us we could check in early! The location of Ilikai Hotel is great for easy transportation, beach location, and shopping. To get around, we used the Waikiki shuttle, which has three different routes, and stops at the Ilikai. The beach is a five-minute walk onto a very nice section of Waikiki. (In fact, we walked through the Sheraton Waikiki where I stayed years ago, and there is no beach there now.) We carried beach chairs and boogie boards that Clint provided, along with our towels and drinks -- all in one trip. One day we rented a paddle board ($35/hr.) and it was fun! For grocery shopping, we went to Foodland at Ala Moana and paid about $5-6 (including tip) for a taxi back to Ilikai. For other trips to Ala Moana to shop, we crossed the street and caught the Waikiki Shuttle there. See Cat at the concierge desk for help getting shuttle tickets.To visit Pearl Harbor, Cat secured a rental car from Alamo, which is across the street from the Ilikai. It was cheaper than airport rates I perused on Kayak.com. The Alamo people were great and we signed papers and were driving away, all within 15 minutes!We celebrated our 25th anniversary during our stay by having dinner at Orchids in Halekulani Hotel, which Cat suggested. It was a very nice restaurant overlooking the beach and ocean, the food was great, and the service was outstanding.One of my favorite parts about staying in the condo was having breakfast on the roomy lanai that overlooked mountains and Honolulu. The patio furniture was nice and comfortable.We washed some clothes in the laundry room next door to the condo -- and we never heard any noise from the washers or dryers. Clint provides an iron and there is an ironing board in the laundry room.I swam in the pool one day, which was well-kept, but preferred being in the clear ocean where we saw large sea turtles one day!Overall, Clint gets my vote as the most accommodating host we' ve ever had for a rental property, and we certainly enjoyed his nice tastes that are true to the photos on VRBO!","Blue Bell, Pennsylvania","Lauren2531988</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Blue Bell, Pennsylvania</strong>",9,5.0

I had a reservation for 5 nights. There were a few negative comments, but since it was so highly rated, I went with the TA scores. The Ilikai is about to undergo (major?) renovations, and boy does it need them. The rooms are worn and barren. Lots of space which will suit families, but then the bathrooms are really cramped---you can only exit one end of the tub/shower otherwise you will have a rinse in the toilet. I was disappointed when I had a housekeeping issue with my first room (the bathroom had the previous guests' undergarments available for try-on) and they said there were no rooms in better condition b/c a renovation was impending, I think they should warn you of this information when you reserve on their website as it indicates what to expect. So, be warned, if you stay between now and June, you'll get the old Ilikai...if you stay during the renovations---good luck...and if you stay after---well, the price will probably be like Trump. Even for the current prices (~$200/night), I thought the condition was inappropriate. As an aside, I was frustrated when the manager who assisted me with the room change could not provide a check-out later than 2 PM (no courtesy rooms for late day showers) without charging me for 50% the current rate---no accommodation for their earlier mistake other room substitution (which, by the way, had a shower floor which could have used some Tilex....).On the plus side, the location is good.","Bedford, Massachusetts","hurwitza</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bedford, Massachusetts</strong>",64,2.0

We loved having the beach chairs, beach mats, coolers, snorkel gear, beach towels and even ice packs available for our use. We cooked breakfast every morning and ate on the lanai. You couldn't ask for a better place to have breakfast and a morning mimosa! The kitchen is very small, but extremely well equipped. It had everything that we needed to make breakfast and dinner. The room was plenty big for the two of us and we loved being able to open the big over-sized patio doors and feel like we were outside. The bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of closet space for our things. I would have given the room a 5 star rating if we had been pleased with the air conditioner. We really only used the air conditioning at night, but it didn't cool the room off very well. We were instructed to not set the temperature below 72 degrees, so we didn't, however I don't think the room ever really got very cool. Maybe it just needs to be serviced. Also, there isn't any water pressure in the bathroom sink (hot water), the shower is fine, but the sink isn't. Other than these small issues, the room was wonderful, the location was really nice. The walkway from the hotel takes you right to the beach. You could easily walk to all the restaurants, shopping and beach walk. I think the parking at the hotel (valet) is quite expensive. After the first couple of days we checked into the parking behind the hotel by the marina and that was much more reasonable. I thought that the key pad entry was very nice, no need to worry about a key. I would definitely recommend this unit to friends and family. It was a great place to stay.

It was mainly occupied by elderly permanent residents of the building and the kids weren't even allowed to jump into the pool - they aren't wild kids but do like to have a little bit of fun. There were never enough pool loungers for everyone - probably because it's a very large hotel and not much room has been allocated to the pool area.I walked down Waikiki beach and wasn't terribly impressed with it but that might be because it was high tide and everyone seemed to be crammed onto a small section of the exposed sand. If you are in Honolulu to shop then it's well located near the shopping complex which you can walk or take the trolley to. The trolley stop is outside the building (not to be confused with the bus stop) and it was a long time before we could actually get on one because they were mainly full. Most of the ones passing the hotel were privately run for Japanese tourists so we couldn't board them.We tried out the restaurant on the top floor - the food was excellent and the view fantastic so try to get there for sunset dinner or sunset drinks and request a table with a view.Stay here if you want space and a good location, but if you are looking for something a bit more swanky then try the Modern hotel next door ,although when I popped my head in there to have a look I noticed that all the double pool loungers were booked for VIP guests only - aren't all their guests VIPs?",Australia,"hotdog6</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",65,4.0

This is especially so for longer stays where being able to cook on a full oven with stove top, as well as a Microwave in addition to being able to stock a full-sized fridge, makes the whole trip more easy going and saves a bundle on not having to eat out at each meal.The staff was uniformly courteous, efficient and professional. Terry Dowsett, the Ilikai Hotel Manager, runs a solid and friendly ship there and it is perfectly located at the beginning of Wakiki for easy access to all that Waikiki, Magic Island and Ala Moana Beach Park has to offer. Not to mention, its only a stone's throw away from the huge Ala Moana Shopping center as well! And all without being too cramped as some hotels right in the middle of Waikiki's Kalakaua avenue can feel.The Ilikai Hotel offers the best bang for your buck that I know of in the area, and as a former 38 year resident of Oahu, I'm well familiar with the lay of the land in Waikiki.S.

It is nice sitting on the Lanai sipping a wine or beer of an afternoon. Great sports bar across the road. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

We saw surfers every morning and a luau dinner on the rooftop of the adjacent building every night.There was an ABC store right across from the Ilikai to get groceries along with a decent store in the hotel. There were also some inexpensive places to eat nearby that we found. There was also a laundry mat with two washers and two dryers on our floor. The cost per load to wash was $2.50 and to dry was $2.50. This was a bit steep I thought but it was nice to have this option. The parking cost, which I believe is the same everywhere in Hawaii, was $28 per day for valet parking at the Ilikai. I think we could have parked at the marina behind the Ilikai for less but since we had a rental car we wanted the security of the valet parking under the hotel. The only thing I would change about this condo would be the fact that the pull out couch was very squeaky so we took the mattress off and that helped some but it was very old also and had a lot of lumps and bumps for the girls.

We opened the window and the balcony door for most of a week while there to get rid of the odor .Random dirty spots on the carpet as if a small pet had also lived there.Hard spots on the carpet that looked like fixed cigarette burns.The carpet seam was separated in one spot about 1” in another about 1/4”.It appeared that the cabinets in the kitchen had been changed do to the fact that there is a sizable gap between the cabinets and linoleum in both the kitchen and bathroom. And one door nob is missing on the lower right corner cabinet in the kitchen by the stove. The kitchen tap was loose and moved about when you used it.Bathroom shower and tub enclosure supposedly has clear glass shower doors that were totally unsanitary with scrape-able soap, skin and calcium on them. They were so coated that at first glance one may think they were frosted. The above counter sink in the bath room was little better. Some walls had streaks terminating in a light brown tear drop stains. In my world neglected unsanitary conditions.The toilet was another major concern. While having a bowel movement I was shocked that my testicles were getting wet. The water in the bowl was far too high. It was an extremely disappointing and unsatisfactory experience. Despite many complaints and checking in when these complaints would be acted upon little or nothing was done to correct the most serious sanitary situations.

We were two adults and 1 child and the room was a pretty good fit.The location was excellent. 10 minute walk from Ala Moana Shopping center and steps from Waikiki beach, The Duke Kahanemoku lagoon next door was great for my son who went to play in it every day (there are small fish which he found fun to chase around the edge). Waikiki beach is pretty much next door and you can walk the entire length in about an hour round trip. There are tons of amenities nearby; restaurants, shopping, car rentals, fishing, surfing and sailing are all within easy walking distance.One thing that was not clear in any of the reviews was parking. We had a rental car for 6 days. parking was pretty easy to find. There are a few stalls behind the buiding and many more in the marina. It is one dollar an hour to park there and the only limit is you can only get a slip for a maximum of 24 hours.. This was not an issue since I was out for most of the day with the car anyway so the most I paid was for overnight parking of around 11 dollars. If you know you are going to be a short time you can park in the free parking at the lagoon for 6 hours. One last note about the parking is that Hawaii 50 was filming at the lagoon (They film the Shrimp truck scenes in the parking lot behind the lagoon) twice while I was there and it reduced the parking quite a bit but I still had no issues.I would say my only minor complaint was the bed frames. I think the platforms were designed for Queen beds but only have double mattresses on them.

We stayed for 5 nights in a two bedroom unit. The unit has plenty of space for a family which was great. We normally stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village which is right next door. The price for two bedrooms was less than one room with double beds at the Hilton. For this alone I would recommend the Ilikai. The location is great, the Hilton complex on one side, the Modern Hotel on the other. Both offer amenities that the Ilikai doesn't have....best of both worlds. The beach is a five minute easy walk. So why three stars? The Ilikai is 50 years old. It shows in some ways. Our rooms were fine, only complaint was the a/c units that are mounted on the wall blow right on the beds. All in all I easily recommend the Ilikai, just know that it is an older property. Sarento's Restaurant was excellent and I recommend a visit. I also recommend Morimotos at the Modern next door.","Phoenix, Arizona","ifly737</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",62,3.0

Two large wardrobes and a decent sized chest of drawers for storage. Iron and ironing board and a safe were also provided. Actual bathroom was quite small with shower over a very short bath,it was a bit shabby but functional. There was an outer area where I normally would have expected the sink to be but wasn't, just a large mirror and counter top. As most people have said the room was a bit tired looking and could do with a refurb. No real complaints about the room, the cleaner came in every day with clean towels etc. We left a tip for her at the end of the first week and near the end of our stay and its the first time that I have been thanked for doing this. Free WiFi worked well in the room. We thought the hotel was in a good position with regards to the beach and the Ala Moana shopping centre but it was a bit of a trek to the main Waikiki area. We did use the trolley service though which stopped just outside the hotel. We booked a couple of trips through the concierge who was very helpful. The only real negative was the pool which was very small considering the size of the hotel and it was difficult to find beds. The best positions were taken early in the day, usually by regulars, and we did see a lot of ""booking"" chairs with towels etc. Also we over heard someone saying that they didn't stay in the hotel but came to the pool every day.

The hotel is located around half an hour from the airport and I caught one of the shuttle buses (Speedi Shuttle) from outside the terminal. A round trip will cost about $30 USD and doesn’t need to be booked in advance. As the hotel is located close to the airport as far as the “Waikiki strip” is concerned, I was the first to be dropped off. I checked in at 0930 and was initially told the room wouldn’t be ready until 1500, which I was expecting. Just before the registration process finished they found a room and off I went (2440) on the 24th floor (25 in total, plus the Penthouse). The room was huge with a large king sized bed. The bathroom was also big with a bath large enough even I could submerge myself in at 6’3”. The bathroom can be split in two with a sliding door separating the vanity & bath from the toilet & shower. The shower cubicle was long but a little narrow so you found yourself rubbing against the shower curtain. I didn’t find this a problem and besides, the bath also had a showerhead on a flexible hose so that was the preferred option. The room had both a safe and bar fridge which was empty; a great idea so you can fill it with whatever you want and not worry about taking something supplied by the hotel. The room had a large balcony with a table and two chairs with an “ocean view”. The hotel has three wings, like a Mercedes Benz symbol effectively. I was on the south eastern wing (Diamond Head side) so looked across to the hotel opposite but to the right and below were the pool, lagoon and ocean beyond. To be honest as good as it was, I have learnt that you don’t generally spend a lot of time in the hotel so if you want an ocean view the beach is 2 mins walk from the foyer! Those on the south western side would have perhaps had a better view across the marina and the sunset beyond.Reception have both beach towels and deck chairs which can be gained by swapping them with a card given to you at check in. There is free wifi in each room but I used the computer next to reception. It was pretty fast and free. There is a bar as well as a number of shops in the lobby area including a general store and sight seeing booking desk. I found both the lagoon and ocean great to swim in but didn’t try the pool.Outside the hotel can be found numerous shops and restaurants. Two minutes from the hotel at the large intersection can be found one of the numerous ABC shops which sells everything from cold drinks to t shirts to band aids. Also opposite the hotel are numerous rental car companies including Enterprise, National and Alamo (which I used). Ten to fifteen minutes walk away back towards the airport can be found the Ala Moana shopping centre which has most things you are looking for. A Walmart is another five minutes beyond it. Alternatively, the main strip is ten minutes walk along the beach or the road behind the hotel.I only encountered one problem during my stay; the air con in the room worked great but I woke up to it rattling away in the middle of the night. A couple of strategically placed wads of paper solved the problem and I reported it early the next morning before heading out on a day trip. I returned later that evening to find the air con had been replaced by a completely brand new unit. Talk about service!It was pointed out to me by someone staying at another hotel that the Ilikai features in the opening credits to the original Hawaii Five-O TV show. I found it on youtube; the main character is zoomed in on in the hotel and even my room could be seen!The hotel isn’t the most glitzy or newest on the beachfront but it oozes character in all the right ways and I wouldn’t hesitate in recommending it; the staff are fantastic and I can’t wait to return!Just a couple of other thoughts; if you hire a car head around the island in an anti clockwise direction as it is much easier to find a car park on the beach side and you are right on the ocean for most of the way. Diamond Head has a small car park so you may need to park outside the crater and enter through the tunnel Allow 30 – 45 mins to climb to the top depending on your level of fitness. Traffic in Honolulu during peak hour is horrible so avoid driving during these times.I went to the Chiefs Luau which was great. Reviews I’d read noted the food wasn’t particularly nice. I thought it was ok; if you are looking for burgers and fries you are in the wrong place! I had a Royal Package which means you get table service and front row. It isn’t in big area so no need to be up front. Although it is only 25 mins from Waikiki, you spend an hour driving around before leaving downtown after picking everyone else up. The other options would be the same though if not worst due to their locations. A local bus to Pearl Harbour will cost $2.50 and take around 1.5 hrs each way. I thought I’d be clever and get on the Pearl Harbour Express. It cost $30 return and took a change of bus and an hour to get there so don’t bother! We were left stranded on return so a couple of us split a cab which cost $40 USD. Get there early if you want to get to the Arizona Memorial; you my have to wait for your turn to get out there by boat.","Sydney, Australia","NX622</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",124,5.0

It seemed to be a bit of an older hotel but to be honest, we had a great time. We had a suite at the Ilikai and it was more than we could have asked for. The room was huge it had a kitchen and an amazing view! The hotel is located at the end of what I like to consider ""hotel zone"" but on the bright side is closer to Ala Moana shopping center. The trolley which I think its $3 or $2 stops right in front of the hotel. The service was great and the valet was very helpful in terms of directions and recommendations. Also, on Fridays aka ""Aloha Fridays"" they have fireworks and the fireworks go off in the cove at the Ilikai so if you don't have a view from your room just head on downstairs and there it is. I don't think I've ever been that close to fireworks but it was such a memorable experience!

I was born and raised in Honolulu (now living on neighbor island), so know the island very well. Although I have stayed at other outstanding hotels on Oahu, I prefer the Ilikai because of the following 1) special rates for locals; 2) parking is included in local rates most times and if not, parking is reasonably priced; 3) you can walk to two beaches; 4) Sarentos Top of the Ilikai Italian Restaurant provides one the the finest views of the ocean/sunset in Honolulu and the food/service is impeccable; 5) The Modern Hotel (sister property) adjoining the Ilikai boasts Morimoto's (exquisite service and Iron Chef meals at reasonable prices); 6) you are also in walking distance to other fun eateries across the street which locals frequent i.e. The Chart House; 7) Ala Moana Shopping Center is a 15 minute walk or 5 minute drive or you can take a free trolly service from the hotel to Ala Moana and other shopping establishments; 8) the hotel is at the ""beginning"" of Waikiki so there are many ways to approach it to avoid traffic in the rush hour; 9) rooms are very spacious and clean; 10) staff is always very polite; 12) rooms with full kitchens are available; 13) Rooms are very quiet if you get an ocean view or partial ocean view. The bottom line - the quality + price of the rooms, central location, ease to recreational spots/night life, ease of getting in and out of the hotel (valets are quick) make the Ilikai my favorite hotel on Oahu. I love the Ilikai because I can pull into the garage at night and not feel compelled to get in my car again to find fabulous food and entertainment just a short walk away. Beds are comfy, great pillows. The only downside is the air conditioner is usually aimed at the side of the bed blasting at the head - so you can try to request for another room configuration. Lastly, if you are not happy with your room management will find another accommodation. On two previous visits I was placed next to construction (renovating hotel) which was quiet over the weekend, however changed on Monday.

Why the 3 stars? 1) parking 2) pool 3) laundryParking was valet only, $28/day with in/out service. Valet staff were awesome by the way, but who wants to spend $30+/day on parking (if you include tips)?! Parking at the next door Ilikai Marina was $20/day self park (i think it is in/out) or park in the street in the back about $1/hr.The pool was super small and was crowded! No open chairs available when I went. The crowd was geriatric, not a very hip scene. The laundry room was down the hall and required quarters. As a parent, being able to do laundry without planning and prep is a luxury and a must.Although this dated hotel has it perks, next time I'll stay at a hotel/condo with free in/out parking, a nicer pool, and an in-unit washer/dryer.","San Francisco, California","eshia01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",29,3.0

This was our fourth year in the hotel. The other year was in one of the condos. While the price for the condo stay was a bit less, we prefer the hotel for the service. All of our stays were in rooms in the Diamond Head wing. Our view was looking out over the lagoon (between the Ilikai and the Hilton Hawaiian Village complex) to the ocean was magnificent. The rooms in the hotel are quite large by any standard but especially by Hawaii standards on Waikiki. The price is very competitive and lower than any other hotel right on the beach in Waikiki by far in our opinion. The lanai (porch) was large too. Two chairs and a table are provided but 6 people could easily sit out there. We spent many hours on the lanai. The king-sized bed was very comfortable but the pillows were not the best. The furniture shows some wear but given the price and size of the room, this was very acceptable. A large desk was provided with room for both my wife and I to set up our laptops. There is high speed wired and wireless internet access. Our room had a microwave and small refrigerator. The refrigerator was plenty big enough for everything we wanted to keep in it. Room are now also equipped with large flat screen televisions. The staff there are outstanding. Extremely friendly and helpful. There are two restaurants in the hotel. Sarento's at the Top of the I, atop the hotel, is Italian and while not casual restaurant priced the food is quite good. The spaghetti with filet mignon meatballs is our favorite. The view is spectacular. On the ground floor is the Ilikai Bar & Grill. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner and prices are very reasonable. They serve a kalua pig BBQ sandwich which is quite good. The also serve a kalua pig loco moco breakfast that is also very good. Loco moco is a local favorite (rice topped with the kalua pig or hamburger, an egg and gravy). A change in ownership between last year and this year led to a definite increase in service. As I mentioned, we like the hotel over the condo because of service. Daily cleaning of the room, fresh towels, and the making of the bed are great. Condos charge significant cleaning fees and only come once a week. Coin-operated aundry facilities are provided on the floor. From the hotel you can easily walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Center to the west and along the entire Waikiki beach to the east. There are a number of outstanding restaurants within walking distance. Our favorite is the Chart House (no relation to the chain) across the street from the hotel. Access to public transportation is a few steps from the hotel entrance. Tours to all popular tourist attractions are available and most will pick you up at your hotel.

We managed without one, but it would have been much easier with one. As mentioned, the location was perfect if you are not a night life person.

The hotel is part condos and part hotel. The staff is helpful and efficient. The rooms are large and comfortable. Ours could have used a bit of a makeover. The arms of the comfy lounge chair were threadbare but otherwise it was a great room. We could sit out on the balcony (a small table and 2 chairs) on the 22nd floor and have a snack and watch the boats go by. Two great things about the room that we loved were the mini-fridge and the amount of outlets. In this electronic age with phones, computers, tablets there were plenty of places to charge our devices at the same time. The wi-fi signal was strong and easy to access, another plus. Although not exactly on the beach (it is by a marina), it is a quick walk to Waikiki beach and the hotel supplies beach chairs and towels. The hotel is within walking distance of shops, high end and fast food restaurants. There are buses and trolleys (some free, some have a fare) in front of the hotel that will take you anywhere on the island if you don't have a car.

We liked the room. Everything was like in the pictures from the website, so there were no surprises. We are a family of 4 (kids 14 and 20). The king bed was comfortable with nice linens. The sofa was comfortable and firm also. I slept 2 nights on it, and didn’t feel the frame or lumps.Room has a lot of closet space, and the bathroom is small, but in good condition. The kitchen had everything we needed. I think the pans were replaced since last review of this room in 2011(they all are in very good condition), but kitchen faucet is still dripping. Kitchen also had a toaster, tea pot, electrical oven, blender, a lot of plates, glasses, cups, and silverware. I brought tea, coffee, and oatmeal from home. Plastic ice packs helped keep our snacks and water cool at the beach. We brought a small lunch box (the same as kids take to school). I wish I brought a travel size bottle of vegetable oil and about the same amount of detergent. The smallest you can buy is still very big for one week. There is laundry room on every floor. $2.50 for washing or drying, we used it a couple of times.We did grocery shopping at FoodLand by the Ala Moana Shopping Centre. It is an easy 10 minute walk there, and we took a cab back. I think it was $7. You can give your phone number during check out in FoodLand to get a discount on your groceries. The hotel location is great. It’s only a 5 minute walk to the beach. We liked to go past the Hilton to the Fort DeRussy Beach(more space and less people). We stayed on the beach by the restaurant with blue umbrellas. This is Hale Koa military hotel. They have good food: burgers, chicken, salads. Everything is about $5 and no tax. We did snorkeling right on the beach, a little to the right of the military hotel when you’re looking at the ocean. There aren’t too many fish, but we saw some and also a turtle.We ate breakfast every morning on our balcony. This room has a very nice city view, and you can see mountains between the buildings, and also several rainbows.One day, we felt like we had too many left overs. So our friends, who stayed in Room 1607, and us brought food, plates and silverware downstairs (there is space with tables and an ocean view outside), and ate our dinner outside.Otherwise, we ate dinner at many different restaurants:Bubba Gump (good shrimp, catch of the day, other food was oily, not very good).Yard House – great food, great service.Ocean House – very expensive. It said in the review, this place has big portions, good portions to share. Also their menu says the same, but portions are regular size and it’s not enough to share. Service is very slow, and the food is not good.Right next door to Ocean House is Shore Bird Restaurant (ocean view). You have to grill your food yourself, but everything comes pre-packaged with spices, and the chef helps you. Food was really great, and grilling was really fun. All 6 of us liked our choices. They have a salad buffet included with many different options.Kaiwa - very good Japanese food. Good sushi and sashimi, good salads and fish dishes. Great service..We rented a car for one day and went kayaking on the Kahana River. There are 3 car rental places in the Discover building just across the street from the hotel, but neither of them had a car that could fit 6 people. We ended up renting a car in a small place on the same street as Ilikai going toward Hilton. Renting a car for one day was very expensive. This also may be because it was during the holiday season.You really don’t need a car in Waikiki, but if you take a bus, remember busses are very slow. They stop every 10 seconds. It takes forever to get anywhere. It took us 1.5 hour to get from Pearl Harbor. We used taxis a lot. It was about $45 to Pearl Harbor, $45 to Hanauma Bay, and $15 to Diamond Head.I will definitely recommend the Ilikai condos. We had a great stay and great vacation.

Pool etc are fine as well but unfortunately the main open areas directly abut the fabulous pool area of the Modern Hotel next door and if not careful one could think that they are the ones for the Ilikai (and then be a little disappointed when you get to the actual pool area for this hotel). No major issues with the building itself but guess I was expecting a little more based on the reviews that I read. All of that being said, I would advise anyone who comes here to do their own homework when it comes to trips, meals etc as the concierges seem to have little knowledge of what the best quality trips, meals etc are. Almost, everything that was recommended was either not what it was billed to be or just plain wrong (tried to book a helicopter tour and was told we could do it on a certain day but was suspicious so called myself and there was nothing for that day). Interestingly, they could get us some tickets for the tour if we listened to a TimeShare presentation at the hotel. Oh by the way, the Ilikai is only 1/3 hotel. The other parts of it are 1/3 timeshare and 1/3 private condos. I did not feel it was appropriate for the concierge to try to steer us toward the inhouse timeshare presentation.

It sounds like the hotel is 'gradually' going through and upgrading the rooms - this is definitely needed, we were on the 24th floor, with nice big balcony and great views, ours was a mountain view, but really a view of other high rises and a bit of the marina, but a good view.....but our room was pretty outdated, so if you are in a higher floor you have the great views, but more likely your room is not been re-done. I would check on this firstly when booking, as if you are staying for longer than 3 nights, you will be better off having a nicer room. If you are travelling with a lot of luggage, it was hard to figure where to put it, as there was no room to even put a suitcase in the second bedroom . This may become a bit tiresome if you were there for a week or so. As far as the location is concerned, it was good if you wanted to be walking distance to Ala Moana Shopping Centre, otherwise it's a bit 'half way' to everything. Its about 20 minutes walk in the other direction to Ala Moana to the main shopping and Beachwalk area of Waikiki, though the trolley buses to go past the hotel.Also, as people have mentioned, you have to know the hotel is not on the beach, in front of it is the Marina. This is a good average hotel, but dont come here if you were wanting a luxury Honolulu experience.","Auckland, New Zealand","markandsue-84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",127,3.0

Although the view is interupted by one of the Hilton Village buildings, the view is still spectacular, provided the room is on the beach side! 2. Staff - very friendly and helpful, linen is fresh. 3.

Lastly, the bar / grill downstairs is terrific and reasonably priced (compared to the Hilton next door), plus the coffee shop next door serves great coffee early in the morning, with very cheerful owner / manager.The bad: 1. The pool. If retro is your thing, you wont be disappointed because this pool area is straight out of circa 1960s. It feels like it has not been upgraded since. There is a hideous looking giant AC or exhaust fan behind the pool which is just ugly. No amount of palm trees is going to cover that. 2. Wi-Fi - sometimes its there, other times it isnt. Our room connection was unreliable at best and my wife needed to sit in the corridor several times to get a good connection, much to the amusement of other guests. 3.

Really looks like in the pictures, which is not always the case. It was maybe a bit smaller than what we thought but nevertheless big enough for 2 adults and one baby. The bed was maybe a bit too soft for our liking but we still slept quite well. Our friends were staying in one few floors down and it was almost exactly like ours. Everything works well and the condo is well equipped. View from lanai is really amazing! Lagoon, ocean, diamond head... Booked through waikiki oceanfront rentals and they really handled everything superbly. We requested a crib for our baby and this was delivered before we arrived (quite pricey though as you could almost buy a new one with that money!($50)).The location is also very good. At the more quiet end of Waikiki but still walking distance from the hustle and bustle. Only few steps to the lagoon and the beach. The pool is a bit small and didn't really use it as we preferred the beach. The big Ala Moana shopping center is about 10 mins walk away and lot's of restaurants also close by. Top floor of Ilikai you also have a very nice (but pricey) restaurant and recommend to go there at least for drinks and for the view. Car rental agencies, ABC, few restaurants, etc are just across the street. Free trolleys and local busses also stop right in front of the building. Next door hotel, which you can access right from the courtyard, also has a nice pool, a pool bar and very cool restaurant.All in all would definitely recommend this place (condo, not sure about the hotel) to anyone looking for a good value place to stay in Waikiki.

(As with any hotel, beware the website!! Somewhat misleading.)Location - not bad, not great. At the very far end of Waikiki, fairly close the Alo Moana Beach and the shopping mall. Easy to get around from here via taxis or busses. Very large rooms. Cheap, especially for Waikiki. The concierge desk staff are knowledgable and friendly. There's a nice dispenser of iced lemon water at the front desk. Woohoo.Oh my, but the down sides! Despite the website pictures, this hotel is NOT ON THE BEACH!!! It overlooks a parking lot for the marina.When I arrived (a 53 year old woman, alone with heavy baggage) there was no bell service. The entry to the hotel is at the bottom of quite a large staircase and the elevator was ""temporarily"" out of service. Broken more like it, under seemingly extensive repairs. There is an escalator, but I was told upon arriving that I could not take my luggage on it. When I asked how I was supposed to get my luggage up the staris I was told to carry it. Seriously. I told the man I have a torn rotator cuff, which I do, he stared at me blankly. Nice welcome. Finally, a security guard took pity on me and carried my bag to the top of the stairs, but not as far as the front desk. Jeez louis.The restaurants! Dreadful!! Sarento`s at the top of the buidling is absolutely horrible. Supposedly ``Fine Dining`. The room is not bad looking, if somewhat pedestrian and boring, but the food is bad beyond belief, particularlly given the pricing. Dinner for 2 will run you $250 with apps and wine and the food is not worth $25. I will say that they wine list is pretty good though.We were seated in one of the smaller rooms, which did have a spectacular view, next to a table of 6 people who were screaming into their cell phones the entire evening. The place was empty so there was no reason for us to have been seated there. The wait staff was useless, knew nothing about the menu or food preperation. Just to be clear, we ate subsequently at Alan Wong`s, Morimoto and Side Street Inn and gladly paid lots of money for exquisite food and spectacular service.The Bar and Grill was fine for breakfast - eggs for $7.95, get what you pay for. Lunch and pu-pus are gross, cheap bar food served in paper take-out containers.The POOL is one of the nastiest I have ever seen in my life. Small, grotty and full of ancient condo owners who resent the hotel guests`presence. I am pretty sure it is the original pool, circa Hawaii 50 1972. Full of rude people, chairs right on top of each other, teeny tiny, no view, behind a concrete wall. NOTE - use the pool next door at the Modern! It`s gorgeous and sleek, with a view, and the bartender will let you use it for a $10 bribe! Also, go there for drinks and pu-pus. The outdoor bar is beautiful at night!The hotel has no accomodation for people checking out hours before their departing flight. I had to check out of my room at noon, my flight did not leave until 9pm. Of course, they will store your bags, but there are no guest ammenities (shower, change rooms) other than the disgusting pool area. Never experienced that before! When I checked my bag at noon the bell guy was going òff duty`and rudely demanded a tip for checking my bags. He wasn`t even going to be there when I left, did nothing but put it on a trolley which was right next to me. This from a hotel that couldn`t get my luggage up the front stairs!!! Then I of course was expected to tip again when I collected my bags in the evening.The `mountainview`rooms are a view of the highrises completely surrounding the Ilikai - I was on the 23rd floor and could make out about 3 inches of mountain. Whatever. It was cheap.The bed was the most uncomfortable bed I have slept in for a very long time. I asked for and received feather pillows to replace the horrible rock-hard foam things that were on the bed when I arrived. That improved my sleep somewhat.Anyway, as the review title implies, You get What You Pay For.The Modern (which bizarrely is also an Aqua resort), right next door, is absolutely gorgeous - sleek, up-to-date, friendly and about the same price. In fact, I spoke to 2 couples who paid lessat the Modern with an Ocean Front room than I did for a Mountainview at the Ilikai .BTW - the Aqua across the street, the Palms, is even nastier than the Ilikai.","Toronto, Canada","Susan M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",79,2.0

If you're a fan of the old Hawaii 5-0, you've seen this hotel. It's the one Steve McGarrett is standing on as the picture zooms onto him as he's looking off the penthouse suite's 26th floor deck. The new 5-0 does the same scene in it's opening credits.I do want to preface my review with the fact I only stayed here one night. That was the plan from the start. I did not leave due to the hotel.Ilikai does have some very good points. The staff I encountered was great. Helpful to a fault. My wife and I arrived late and the chef was willing to make us food even though the kitchen had been closed for nearly 1/2 hour. The bar and front desk staff were very nice. All of the staff rated far better than some hotels I've stayed at in Hawaii and elsewhere.My wife and I stayed in the Ilikai in January of 2013, The room I was in 2412, was very large. The view was much nicer than most, with a triple sliding door that opened to a very large lanai. I had a view of Diamond Head, the lagoon by the Hilton and the ocean. The bathroom was also very large, with both a tub and a shower. There was also a little kitchenette area. All this was very nice.The location of the hotel is good. It's a short walk to get to the beach (by the Hilton). Not much more than three city blocks. You can opt for the lagoon, which would be nice if you have small children. No waves and not crowded. Shopping and restaurants are close by.The cost was very affordable, just over $200 including all taxes and fees. Free wifi was a plus.Not for the not-so-good. The air conditioner is on the side of the room as the bed. I directed the flow of air away from the bed as best I could, but my wife and I both woke up with sore throats from the cool, dry air. If you like cold air on you during the night, this might be a plus.The was also a ""mystery noise"" that came from somewhere in our room by the door. I never figured this noise out, but it was enough to wake me several times during the night.The nasty part was the shower. It had not been cleaned well and somebody had wiped their nose and then wiped the shower wall. I had to clean this with toilet paper, as the hotel gave us only one towel, hand towel and wash cloth each. I didn't tell my wife or she would never had showered. My towel had some stains on it, which always grosses me out. Again, the wife got the ""clean"" towel. Finally, there was a green substance on the lower rim of the sink. Unless you bent down close to the level of the sink you wouldn't see it, but I did. Again, my wife didn't hear about this either.All of these bad things could be an anomaly, as I stated, I only stayed here one night. I have no doubt the staff would have corrected these shortcomings, but I didn't bother them as I wasn't coming back.The hotel is dated - it was built in the 60s. It looks it's age. I could have overlooked all of this and given the hotel a 4 or even a 5 because of the staff's helpfulness and friendliness, and the great value of the hotel. But I can't overlook the lack of cleanliness. It was really nasty and I expect more from any hotel.","Fernandina Beach, Florida","1960Corvette</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fernandina Beach, Florida</strong>",119,3.0

Ever since it changed to Da Big Kahuna staff in early 2012, the quality of service, attitude, food, and atmosphere has decreased 100%. The girls working there dress (AND ACT) more like strippers than waitresses. The majority of them have absolutely NO service industry skills; i.e., walking past customers 3-4 times before acknowledging them, joking at the bar with their boyfriends that visit instead of checking on their customers, and forgetting parts of the order. These girls will tell you that they prefer working at Da Big Kahuna bar because that's where the tips are. They say NONE of them want to work at the Ilikai bar & grill and their work performance makes this painfully obvious. At any given time, 3-6 of the 10 bar stools are occupied by waitresses/waiters taking breaks, getting extremely drunk after work, or watching TV before work. They should not be taking up the barstools on their breaks. I witnessed a family walk out when a half-naked waitress with her foot on the bar, who said she had finished her shift, was drunk and eating sloppily at the bar, who then leaned her head back and let out a huge belch. Not only didn't the manager or barmaid tell her to leave, they laughed along with her and kept feeding her shots. I've seen several waitresses finish their shift and get sloppy drunk at the bar, using loud profanity and rude mannerisms. Although they are off-duty, they continuously walk behind the bar to pour themselves shots and other drinks. A couple of weeks ago, one of the bartenders was drinking with the Ilikai security lead, and he had several personal mini bottles of alcohol lined up on the bar that they proceeded to drink with mixers from behind the bar. I've seen the Ilikai security lead and other Ilikai security staff drinking with the bar & grill staff on more than one occasion. I am a Security Manager, so I understand how unprofessional this is and how much liability it creates for the Ilikai hotel. As a final note, the local musicians they bring in to play should be stopped. Their wires are all over the place, they are in the way, and their amps are either too loud or sound blown. Families want to hear themselves talk when they eat there and people at the bar (when they can wrestle a stool away from the staff) want to watch the televisions. I understand they are trying to create a Hawaiian ambience, but people on vacation already know they're in Hawaii and I believe would rather eat without having their eardrums tortured.

It is located at the entrance to Waikiki and not in the heart of things. However it is within walking distance of Ala Moana shopping center ( which they tout as the worlds largest outdoor mall), as well as many great restaurants (the food court at Ala Moana has something for everyone - check it out). The huge Hilton Hawaiian Village complex is right next door with a bunch of food and beverage outlets ranging from fast food to luau's, fireworks every Friday night, Hawaiian music, shopping bazaar, sunset sails, water toys, and the list goes on.

The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. We arrived a few hours early and they were able to put us in a great ocean view room high on the 23rd floor. The housekeeping staff (same woman each day) was wonderful and friendly -- not only did she do a great job cleaning, but did some extra small things that we really appreciated. The rooms were large and very bright, and the balconies are huge. The price of the hotel room was about $220 incl. per night, and included free high speed wifi, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, beach towels and beach chairs. Although the hotel is not located directly on the beach (the marina is right in front), there is easy access to the beach and lagoon in front of the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The only downside was noise. First, a group of young adult/adolescent basketball players were in rooms around us and above us and one night were partying loudly on their balcony from 1:00 until 2:30 when I finally called security. The young people were so loud that there was no way that security could not hear them if they were checking the halls and patrolling outside. Second, the hotel seems to be doing some work on the grounds all day long, which meant if you were in your room, you could hear jack hammers and other such loud construction noise.Otherwise, we really enjoyed staying at this hotel, preferred the location (close to Ala Moana shopping center, as well as Ala Moana park), and felt that it provided a good value for the money. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.As an aside, having stayed at both the Ilikai and the Hyatt on this trip, and visiting a friend in their room at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (Diamond Head Tower), it seems that the high-end hotels here are not as swank as you might find on the mainland or in other major cities in the world. All the bathrooms were small and outdated, although some a little better than others.

We stayed in a room on the 23rd floor with a view of the Hilton complex and Duke Kahanamoku Lagoon. The room was spacious and easily acccomodated a roll-away for our son (which was a sturdy unit that felt more like a real bed than the more commonly used type that looks and feels like a rat trap set to spring). We booked here when we discovered the Hilton was pretty much booked and whose rates had become astronomical (we are locals who just wanted to stay a few days in town). We were pleasantly surprised at every turn (and after having a single, mobbed with people, stroll through the Hilton at 10pm, relieved by our choice). Great room with beautiful views of the ocean. The staff we dealt with, from the front desk to the valet, were all very pleasant people. Our roll-away was delivered within minutes of our arrival. While our unit did not have a mini-kitchen, it did have a fridge and microwave (what more do you really need?). A coffee maker with no charge for coffee, free wifi, and a local newspaper every morning (even on Sunday! Thank you Ilikai!!) rounded things out and NO resort charge. With five elevators, access to our high-floor room was convenient in a way that often isn't. We had a great experience without so much as a single gripe. It was the weekend before Christmas and one of the reasons we had wanted to stay in town was to check out all the Christmas decorations at other hotels. We were very surprised to find that the Ilikai had the best decorations of the many we visited (sadly, the Moana and Hilton seemed to have scaled back considerably). The Ilikai has a small garden area in the lobby that was full of lights and decorations that made it a warm and festive area to stroll through. The Ilikai is within quick walking distance of Ala Moana Shopping Center and has access via a ramp to the lagoon area and Hilton beach. The only thing that disappointed was the lack of a hot tub in the pool area (but this is sort of personal quirk of mine; most Waikiki hotels lack them, for whatever reason).

We really enjoyed walking down boardwalk and peeking into the other hotels lining the beach. It’s a pricey area in general, but there are some less expensive restaurants within easy walking distance.  As many other reviewers have noted, the rooms are spacious with mini-kitchens. We only used the coffee maker and refrigerator, but appreciated that we could heat something up if we wanted to. The convenience store on the ground level of the Ilikai was a pleasant surprise. It has a decent selection of food/beverages and sundries. While high, the prices weren’t as outrageous as we expected, particularly on alcohol. We rented a convertible from Alamo (just across the street) and had a really great time driving around the island for two days. The hotel concierge got us a better rate for the rental than we could find online. The roads are easy to navigate and the island very manageable in size. It takes less than an hour to reach the opposite side of the island where there are long stretches of lovely beach. Don’t miss the great offerings of the roadside fruit stands and food trucks. For $12 you get a big plate of garlic shrimp or hulu chicken with rice and salad. Outstanding eats at a fraction the cost of most things in Honolulu. The Ilikai’s pool area is nothing to get excited about, but it’s nice for taking a quick dip after a day exploring the island. I suppose it’s because of the congested high-priced land on Waikiki that none of the hotels have the massive resort-style pool areas that you find on other islands. Again, the Ilikai’s pool is perfectly adequate for a quick, refreshing dip—just don’t expect to be happy lounging beside it for hours on end (that would get depressing). We particularly appreciated having access to the pool and changing rooms after we checked out on the last day. We had an evening departure out of HNL so were glad to have a place to freshen up before our 8 hour flight. I would definitely stay at the Ilikai the next time I go to Honolulu—excellent location, nice views from the rooms (especially higher floors), decent restaurants, and a really friendly, helpful staff.","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","BB-MadCity</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>",118,4.0

We stayed on the 20th floor with a full kitchen, microwave, refridge and a sofa bed. All the furnishing has modern flavor, granite counter top in kitchen and bathroom. The room is clean. Room service will pick up garbage and replace towel daily but they only did our bed for one day. Not sure if this is a standard with this hotel. We liked the full kitchen so we can save money on eat out. The room is a little bit crammed with 4 people especially there is no separate sleeping area. Living and sleeping is in one common area. There is no dinning table so you have to use the coffee table. The hotel staff was very friendly and they also offer beach towels which you can get from the office. Some tips:- the hotel is next to Hilton Village. You can walk over there to watch Friday night firework and also go in to take the beach walk and use lagoon. Hilton also has boat rental which is convenient.- the hotel charges cancellation fee as soon as you book. (at least at the website we booked) We noticed that the price kept dropping. By the time we are ready to go, it is almost dropped more than 150 dollars for a 4 night stay. We didn't pay attention to the cancellation penalty when we first booked. Even with the penalty, we still got some money back after the re-book. Be aware.- Across street, you have McDonald and Subway. Trolly and free shuttle to Hilo shopping center can pick up in front of the hotel. Ala Mona Shopping center is not far away.- We didn't park at the hotel. We used the parking near Modern for the first day, which is 20 dollars. Then used the free parking behind the hotel during the daytime ( Maximum 6 hours). At night, we either use the hourly parking next to the free parking, which costs 6 dollars for 10 hours on weekdays or at the parking near Modern using their 7 dollars for 10 hours rate at night. It works out for us. Save quite a bit money.","kirkland, wa","waikiki_sunset</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>kirkland, wa</strong>",21,4.0

If you don't want to walk, the trolley stops right in front of the hotel-$2/person/one way. The restauant in the hotel is reasonably priced with good food. There is also a little store in the hotel,decent prices, but save some money and go to one of the numerous ABC stores within walking distance. The Hilton is right next door, with restaurants and shops (prices are definitely jacked up, but the pizza place was reasonable)-you must try the local ice cream at Lappert's.

It has been a special place for me since 1983, when I was a Honolulu resident. I used to come for the special weekend radio broadcast breakfasts at the Top of Ilikai with Larry Price and Michael Perry. Then, twenty six years ago I met my husband at the Ilikai and since then we have visited Ilikai many times. This has been our comeback after fifteen years (I flew 24 hours from Europe for a week stay, my husband joined me from Australia) on the occasion of our 25th Wedding Anniversary. For that reason I have booked far in advance a room in our favourite Ilikai Tower with the Marina View and was quite disappointed to get a Diamond Head View instead. The next day we were able to move to the room with the desired view, where we stayed the following eight nights. Apart from this unnecessary hiccup everything was wonderful. We will be back again, the feeling of Ilikai has still that same old magic, - like us, it hasn’t lost its Aloha spirit at all.","Melbourne, Australia","Barbra001</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",5,5.0

Portions of it are traditional hotel and portions are privately owned condos. We were visiting with family and each person reserved something different. Normally I would give the Ilikai 3 stars but will give it 4 today because it has so many options.We had a traditional hotel room, reserved through the Ilikai. It was a basic 2 doubles room with an ocean view. The room itself was quite large and there was plenty of room to move around. We did not get a room with a kitchen. The view was remarkable and it was great to sit on the balcony in the morning and drink coffee or watch the sunset in the evening. A man goes out onto the patio at sunset and blows a conch shell to signal the end of the day and we easily heard it in our room. The room could have used a little refreshing as far as décor went; it was bit dated and starting to show a bit of wear. The rooms were clean and bedding was fine, nothing spectacular. The staff was very friendly. While the hotel did offer free Wi-Fi, the ability to log on and do anything more than basic surfing/email checking was hit or miss. I tried to Facetime with some family on Thanksgiving Day and email a couple of photos (several times) and was unable to do either. The location is fine, the lagoon and beach is fine although we preferred to walk down the beach a bit for a less rocky area. Additionally, we chose to use the valet parking. Initially we were not excited about the $25/day cost and family members raved about the $10 spot they got at the Red Lobster down the street but after a day or two of walking to and fro and/or hunting for free parking it was universally decided that the convenience factor was well worth the cost. We did not go to the pool, it was small and basic we opted for the ocean instead. While there is access from the patio to the pool at the Modern next door, I was told Ilikai patrons were not permitted to use it.The Ilikai has a nice coffee shop and café downstairs. The food was reasonably priced and tasty. Additionally there was a drug store downstairs that we frequented on more than one occasion and I remarked that the prices were not as outrageous as I expected. There are a number of fast food options directly across the street as well as a wide variety of restaurants located next door at the Hilton.Two family members rented a room with a kitchen through Marina Hawaii Vacations. These are privately owned condo rooms and can vary widely. One was “economy” and the décor, appliances and furniture were all circa 1965. Marina Hawaii will admit that these rooms are not renovated. Another family member rented a partially renovated room that was a bit of a step up but still dated. Marina Hawaii has an office on the 2nd floor and manages many of the privately owned condos. These rooms consisted of a small kitchen, one or two double beds and a couch. They are the same size as the non-kitchen rooms, just more crammed into one area. We did have approximately 15 people in one room for dinner and it was crowded but we were able to move around fine.Another family member rented a room with a kitchen through VRBO. His room was fully renovated and was pretty nice. It included granite counter-tops and new stainless steel appliances as well as Wi-Fi that was more reliable. Again, because these are privately owned condos the condition and upkeep can vary widely. That room (along with the 2 above) were city views that overlooked Ala Moana Blvd. The rooms were quiet despite being on a busy street. We have yet another family member who owns a fully renovated condo and obviously is quite nice. That is a mountain/ocean view room. The view is of the Hilton next door, Diamond Head and the ocean. You can see the fireworks from the Hilton on Friday nights.Overall the Ilikai offers a lot of flexible options and a good but not great location. If you are looking for value, especially if you are staying for an extended period, this is an excellent choice. If you are looking for more of a “resort” type feel or luxury hotel this is probably not a good fit for you (unless you luck out on a VRBO room).","Houston, Texas","VWoo8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",102,4.0

(definitely not long enough).We arrived early for check in, our room wasn't ready so the put us in one similar that was ready so as not to make us wait. (said they would just swap us over with another couple and the other couple would get our room when they arrived). Good service, didn't find that everywhere! The room was on 24th floor, absolutely fantastic - large with a nice sized balcony, a bar fridge, microwave and coffee maker and good size tv. The bed was very comfortable (and huge! King size.) We ate breakfast on the lanai (balcony) every morning and in the evenings sat watching the city lights after strolling back from dinner, mostly along the beach, sometimes through town and past the gardens - no bugs in sight! We didn't have a beach view but not complaining because the view of the city and the mountains was spectacular (especially at night).The bathroom was a very good size and there was a bath! which was much appreciated after our walk up Diamond Head. A shame that I had to clean it before I could use it as it still had scum around the inside from someone else's previous use, and the grout in the shower was alittle bit grotty. While we're on complaints, there was a really comfy armchair in the room,it would have been nice to have two of them since there were two of us. ( a toaster would have been nice too)  But I count those as only a few small complaints as overall we were happy. The location is great for going anywhere - the beach, lagoon, Diamond Head, A la Moana.Speaking of which - I'm not that much into the shopping b but it is a huge impressive shopping centre. I would have to say that Foodland was my favourite here, such a variety of salads, meats and fruitsalads, yogurts and drinks( bread we got from a great little bakery a couple of shops up). You can pick up something to warm up in the microwave to have in room if you want to stay in, or better still grab a pick-nick lunch to have on the beach or in a park, inexpensive and really good.We found all the meals we had were actually very good and good value. We managed to get into Dukes, also had dinner at Tropics, have fish Tacos at Maui Tacos, had lobster tail at the shrimp place in the international market food court, all excellent!Loved Cholo's in Waliewa too. Took the bus around the Island and stopped great food, great atmosphere. Trip well worth doing, had a great day and met nice people. It was recommended to us to get a 4 day bus pass and I agree. Just so much to do and enjoy. Great Coffee at Island Coffee, try one of their Acai Cups ,(breakfast , lunch or just a snack) you're in for a treat.Love all the entertainment, music everywhere you go.Love free WIFII at the Ilikai.Love the bus drivers.(The ones that are not just for the Japanese only!)Love the warm moonlit walks on the beach.Staff at the Ilikai helpful and friendly, location is perfect, wouldn't think of going anywhere else.",melbourne,"seedielady</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>melbourne</strong>",4,4.0

Such a beautiful place with all the shops you can think of) and then relaxation by the lagoon. We went to the beach on the first day but then decided to go to the lagoon after that because the beach is not all that great - coarse sand and not too great views. The lagoon on the other hand was nice and relaxing, there were mostly families enjoying the area around the lagoon but it was actually a surprisingly calm place to sun bathe. The sand is coarse, but that doesn't really matter when you're lying on a beach towel anyway.The location is great for going anywhere - the beach, lagoon, Diamond Head, A la Moana...I would definitely recommend the Ilikai and would go back in a second!",Europe,"kaikkom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Europe</strong>",14,5.0

It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the main Waikiki area at a moderate pace.I'm a light sleeper so the negative is the noise that we heard from our room:1) Our room was right next to the elevator, so we heard the elevator most of the night. The front desk was willing to move us to another room, but we opted not to since the other room doesn't have a nice view. 2) There was a loud ticking one of the nights.

The Honolulu Harbor was very close and we were close to downtown too. Not to mention that the Ilikai is one of the stops for the trolleys that go by so often. Oh and Wailana Coffee House is across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village and it is open 24 hours, serving breakfast all day. The staff were very friendly and the location was very convenient.The hotel entrance consists of a staircase and to the right of that is an escalator.

It was late and I booked the room months ago. All I could remember was that I used whatever code the system online would allow. She told me that to use this rate we would have to write a letter to a veteran. I didn't quite understand, but writing a letter to a veteran was not difficult so I did it and presented it the day before we checked out. Also when my husband checked out, the total hotel charges were LESS than the amount from the online reservation.With two little kids, we got a room with two double beds. I am used to sleeping on a 6-year-old Serta mattress with a lumpy pillowtop. So these beds and pillows at the Ilikai were HARD and thin. My husband commented on it too. Even though they were hard, they gave you three per bed and we were able to prop them here and there to sleep and, we slept exceptionally well. The hotel provided a rollaway crib for our baby, free of charge. The crib was all metal and looked more like a cage than a crib, but it was free and saved us from renting or bringing our Pack and Play.The view was spectacular. We could see the ocean, the yacht club in front of it as well as the Honolulu Harbor to the far right. I could actually see cruise ships in port. If you looked down you had a good view of the pool and hotel grounds. On the first Friday, we took advice from another Trip Advisor review and got pizza from Round Table at the Hilton and took in the Hilton fireworks. I would say we were able to see them, but not all of it. On our last Friday we walked down the ramp and stood along the Hilton Lagoon to watch them which was much better. Also the pizza from Round Table is average, at best. I almost think we could have done better getting pizza at the Ilikai Bar & Grille and saved the walking.The room was equipped with a mini fridge (which got a lot of use as storage for juice for the little ones), a coffee maker, and microwave oven. There is a small safe in the closet as well as an ironing board and hair dryer. There were also a few hangers and dry cleaning supplies. The closet in the bathroom area had a luggage stand and a few hangers. We only had a tub/shower stall, not separate as in some reviews. It was big enough for our two boys to bathe in. The shower head was Water Pik and it provided very good water pressure. The outside showed some signs of wear - possibly mildew or just cracking. It didn't bother me too much to investigate.Bathroom amenities were body soap and hand soap; coconut lime shampoo and conditioner, and coconut mango lotion, all exclusively for Aqua Hotels.Being so high up and with the two little kids, I would have liked to had some netting for the lanai. They probably would have provided it, but we didn't ask. We just held onto the 1-year-old when we were out there. The 3-year-old knew better than to climb or try to fit through the bars. I had read the hotel was grandfathered and that the bars are too far apart - this is certainly true. I know my 26"" tall, 25 lb 15-month-old could have gone through them, had he been allowed to try.The lanai has a small table and two chairs. The air conditioner makes a lot of noise when running on the lanai. Sadly the sun is so hot you can't really sit out there during the day, unless you like it that hot. It would have been wonderful to have a locking screen door to feel the trade winds when it was so hot as there was always a wonderful breeze. For those of you with little ones, check out my picture regarding the lock on the lanai. I brought baby locks with me because I was unsure of what the door was like. It is a strong metal hook, kind of like an upside down ""U,"" but it is at least 5' high. It was well above my 3-year-old's head. However, when my husband went to get take out and I was doing laundry down the hall, I did not feel safe enough to leave them alone in the room while I went to get the laundry. Thoughts of my 3-year-old taking the desk chair to the lock or my 1-year-old knocking down the lamp and starting a fire were in my head. So I brought them with me. Note: Parents please be safe. Don't leave your kids alone for a second. Kids are capable of anything and anything can happen.Our housekeeper, God bless her soul, was great. As far as trashing hotel rooms, our two boys have NOTHING on rock stars. :-) I was glad I had my baby wipes with me because they went a long way to cleaning up stains on the bed linens, which were all WHITE. We did our best not to track in so much sand and to keep the room as clean as we could, but she did a wonderful job of replenishing our supplies and cleaning the room for us. And on Saturday she brought free magazines (Honolulu, Whole Living, Wine Spectator). I also noticed that many times she didn't put plastic bags in the trash cans. The cans are typical and small and with kids and the baby's dirty diapers we ended up using grocery bags as liners. I know in California they are working on phasing out plastic store grocery bags and I wonder about Hawaii and whether wastepaper bags are the same way. Maybe she just forgot. It wasn't that big of a deal.One other great thing is that there is a coin-operated laundry room on every floor, just to the right of the mirror by the elevator. Both the washer and the dryer cost $2.50. There are laundry supplies you can buy for $1.25 so you don't have to go to the sundry store for them. There is also a soda machine that dispenses bottles of soda for $1.50 as well as the ice machine.Speaking of sand, there is a bather's elevator around the corner from the Ilikai Tower elevator (the main elevator to the hotel rooms). There is also the glass elevator to Sarento's restaurant.There is a sundries store on the lobby floor. The prices are high, but not much more than you will find at the drug store or grocery store. They really do have a large variety of items. I only wish the store clerks had been friendlier. No one really smiled or engaged in conversation. As far as friendliness goes, our housekeeper, the bell hop (when we passed him in the elevator), and the dining room manager at Sarento's (Jason Watkins) were the most friendly people we encountered. Pretty much all the other guests we ran into were friendly as well. I wish the front desk had been friendlier and, my husband felt the concierge was lacking.Every night before sunset there is a man dressed in red and yellow and he blows the conch shell and then the torches are lit. The grounds are very beautiful.The Ilikai Bar & Grille serves good food that is average price. We ate dinner there on a weeknight and it was pretty empty. When they had the hula show on Friday night, it was packed.The pool is on the small size and fills up fast. The hotel will supply you with beach towels, but you need to sign a waiver first. Then you are given cards that you exchange for the towels. If you do not turn in the towels, they will charge you $20 for each towel.The guys and gals at the valet are very friendly and are quick to retrieve your car. They charge $25 a day for valet parking. We tried parking at the yacht harbor as other reviewers recommended, but it was not as easy for the time we needed and it amounted to about the same charge as the hotel valet.As many others have said, Hilton Hawaiian Village is next door. They have a lagoon that is a short hop from the Ilikai (just down the ramp). This is a great place for families with little kids. We went there often, though the sand was very hard on my husband's feet so he preferred walking a little further to Waikiki beach which is just on the other side of the lagoon.Though this is not a review for Sarento's, it is part of the hotel. We dined here on our last night. The food is expensive, but not much more than other places around. The view is amazing and the food is wonderful. They allow children and even have a keiki menu - $12 for entree, beverage, and dessert. My only regret is that we wasted meals at nearby Outback and Red Lobster when we could have paid a little more and ate at Sarento's for three nights instead of one. I highly recommend you dine there at least once. When you check in you receive a shell lei for each person along with a coupon booklet that includes 10% off food only at Sarento's. The booklet was a nice touch, but we forgot we had it so we didn't use it.Other aspects of the hotel are the concierge desk. I did not see him, but my husband did. Apparently he is only there until around 2 in the afternoon. My husband thought he was too pushy with the whole Shell Vacations time share thing and he did not feel he offered much information about what to see. However, there is a huge selection of brochures. Be sure and pick up a free copy of Oahu Gold and/or This Week Oahu which has coupons and tour information.The hotel has a boutique clothing store on the lobby floor along with Shell Vacations and a small gym. I did not use any of these, but I walked by them. The gym was empty, but it had plenty of treadmills and elliptical machines.All in all we had a wonderful time at the Ilikai. We would stay there again in a heartbeat. If money was not an object would I stay choose this hotel? I would pick the Halekulani and pay $7k for a three bedroom suite and private butler! But if I wanted a clean, spacious room in a great location, I would always choose the Ilikai.The hotel layout was easy enough that even my 3-year-old would talk about needing to turn this way and that. It's no secret that the Ilikai is an old hotel, but it has a lot going for it. I hope the new owner can bring it back to its former glory. It would not take much to bring it around. The lobby and grounds are beautiful and Sarento's is a great restaurant with an amazing view. Having room service would be a wonderful addition because there are many times you find yourself wanting something quick without having to walk to get it. You can also order online, but there are too many options and it is frustrating when you are hungry.",Lake Balboa,"maybaby2009</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake Balboa</strong>",5,4.0

Across the street was an ABC store, Subway, McDonald's, Buffalo Wild Wings, etc. I highly suggest Marukame Udon for dinner one night, it's a 10-15 minute walk.

The first night we went next door to the Hilton and used the bar and grill, this was the first and last time we did. Apart from the cocktails the food and service were not great for a 5star joint, oh and then there's the price $18 for 2 pints of lager I nearly died!The next night we stayed in our hotel and used the ilikai bar and grill very comfy, nice food, great service and boy was it cheaper! The shop in the hotel is very good selling gifts, food and drink so you can stock up in your room we did this and it saved a lot of money on breakfasts and dinners, we ate out most nights using the vouchers we were given when we checked in however we still found the ilikai bar and grill better.The hotel is in a great position and you have the choice of pool, lagoon or Waikiki beach.On an evening the sunsets are amazing from the balcony but for the best sunsets you need to ask for a room on the side the sunsets although to be honest if you have a high room you should have a nice view.There is a gym which was never over crowded and had everything you needed for a quick workout.On an evening you can walk down Waikiki beach to the duke's statue then walk down the Main Street and look in all the fantastic shops and restaurants, we loved the Hard Rock Cafe, best one i have ever been in by a country mile and then some!!!All in all if your looking for a nice clean comfortable friendly hotel I would highly recommend the Ilikai.Ps strongly advise on car hire to see the rest of this fantastic island and its far cheaper to book it through the hotels concierge service who are very very knowledgable","Crook, null, United Kingdom","Glenn M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Crook, null, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

The rate we paid was much less than what other well reviewed hotels in the area seemed to be charging and we booked directly with the hotel. We also paid 25$/day +tips for valet parking to save time and hassle with less expensive options.Ironically, the Waikiki area was of little interest to us, so we would usually leave the area in the morning. This ended up working well because we were usually going against the flow of traffic.

We are people who plan ahead, and so we didnt really require information from anyone in the hotel/didnt use concierge desk for anything. The hotel itself was nice. Anyone we did talk to, just walking around, was able to direct us toward the nearest xyz etc. The lobby level has shops, a convenience type store with some groceries, souvenirs, straw mats, towels, toiletries, postcards etc, the Ilikai Bar and Grill, their outdoor pool is down a walkway, beach access etc. We didnt use the pool because the beach was so close we couldnt resist sitting on the beach and being able to swim in the ocean, with Diamond Head in the background! The hotel also has Sarentos restaurant at the top of the hotel which is one of Waikiki's top restaurant and is known for their view. There is an ABC (or 12) across the street for groceries as well, so we stocked up on our weeks needs when we got there).We did get food to go one night from the Ilikai Bar and Grill and also dined there (its outdoors, and half of it is also covered) and thought our food was great both times. Our actual room was great. Took us a second to figure out how to open the door, but once we were in, we were happy. The condo is updated; the kitchenette is tiny but the same size as ours in NY. Granite countertops, new appliances, all utensils provided for what you would need to prepare all meals inside. The majority of our days we had breakfast in our room, made lunch to take with us and ate dinner out somewhere else. Thats what we like to do on our trips and it was nice to be able to do that with more than a tiny hotel table, with a tiny fridge, limiting your options. The couch in the living area was nice, with a coffee table to lounge and watch tv in the morning or late at night. The bathroom was updated and had a rack of towels, including beach towels. The bed was so comfortable, we passed out everynight. From the lanai you have a beach view, pool view, and Hilton Hawaiian villages luau view. You can hear it a little at night, but it wasnt bothersome at all. A few nights we went out for a little while and watched different pieces. The view of the fireworks on Friday night, were great. All the information that you need is emailed to you within hours of booking, and there is also information provided to you when you get in the room with details for wifi, pool, restaurant recommendations etc. It was a really pleasant experience to rent the condo and I would definitely recommend it through waikiki oceanfront rentals.

This time we used AlohaCondos.com to book #1639. This was the nicest room we have rented. It is updated with granite counters, stainless steel full-sized applicances, tile floors and bathroom and is just as the photos show it. Aloha Condos and the owner made the process very easy and quick, no hassles. Everything we needed was available in the unit from dishes and cookware to beach chairs and towels. Be aware that if you book directly with the owners, you will not have access to some services at the Ilikai, but this owner provided pool passes and phone numbers for contacting services such as maintenance if the need were to arise. The view is over the marina which is our favorite - great sunsets, but you do need to go down to see the Friday night fireworks as you can't see them from this room (go lagoon view if you want to see them). What you can see from this room is the Modern Honolulu next door. The view of their pools is nice, but we also noticed several people who didn't think they needed to close their drapes while in their underwear. One blonde lady did all her packing in a black bra and thong on Sunday night. It was hard not to notice.The Ilikai is close to shopping, restaurants and the city bus so we don't rent a car when on Oahu. We usually shuttle to and from the airport and use the bus for everything else. This trip we found a great luggage storage service for our extra suitcases while we spent a couple days ""island-hopping."" Cliff at BeachBum.com was recommended by the Best Western and we will VERY HAPPY with his service.

I spent some time before booking looking at reviews and chose this particular unit for its high floor and view. The room was a large studio with a full kitchen which was plenty adequate for the 4 nights we were there, We made breakfast and had happy hours on the balcony but dined out each night. The view was wonderful but the panels across the balcony made it difficult to sit and look out. We squeezed the chairs up by the AC unit and could just about see around then when sitting down. This was a bit of a disappointment to me as the whole choice had hinged around the view and it was a bit misleading on the website. Standing up, the view was magnificent, out towards the airport, overlooking the marina and we saw awesome sunsets every night. The general condition of the room was okay, flat screen TV, reasonable bathroom but there wasn't much storage space and the flimsy wicker draw unit almost unusable. The pool was small but quite nice and the Hilton Lagoon and the sea close enough for a swim in more natural surroundings. It was a bit of a hike to the centre, which we didn't mind, although it was starting to get a bit tedious by the fourth day. This end of Waikiki is much quieter, depends on which you prefer, it is an easy walk to the Ala Moana Mall.

This is more expensive, eventually we found out there cheaper alternatives (through owners) which we did not risk doing as it was our first time in Hawaii.Taxi fare from airport to the hotel is around USD35-40 one way (tip included). This is not a bad price thanks to its location, which is at the edge of Waikiki. So, it is relatively quiet and far from the Waikiki area. However, it's only about 20-30 mins walk to the Waikiki area, and if you're lazy, can pay USD2 per person for a hop-on hop-off pink line Waikiki Trolley. The Ilikai is also near the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, about 10-15 mins walk.My initial impression of the hotel reception was not good (this lady works on the Friday night shift). She seemed a bit fake and somewhat unhelpful. However, the next few days, there were far better hotel reception clerks. Valet guys were good.Our room was very old. The dishwasher was not working (luckily we don't use it anyway). The decor seems very 1970s, which suits some people. I got used to it eventually because the ocean views and sunset made up for it. Shower is a bit old and may need stronger water pressure. Maybe other rooms are better.There was a free WIFI which is a big bonus. There's a bar/restaurant downstairs which had huge and affordable meals. The coffee shop is also very good! There's a shop to buy other goodies (mart) which is reasonably priced. Washing machine and dryer available for 10 x 25c per machine on each floor.However, at one time during our stay, some alarm went off at 1am which was annoying.Overall, I highly recommend this for the location (quiet and relaxing), the free WIFI, availability of laundry on each floor and affordable food/coffee downstairs.

We were there for one week in suitre 1120. We rented a car for 3 days at the end of our stay and enjoyed using the valet parking....the attendants were very friendly and helpful. This is an older building with new upgrades...great for having your own privacy with buses stopping at the front door, an ABC store a short walk across the street, trolley buses stop outside of the hotel and you can walk around and pass through shops of all descriptions. The mall is a 10-15 minute walk across the canal if you have energy. Go to Dukes for the buffet breakfast that starts at 730 am.

We were on vacation with my brother who is stationed in Honolulu. I thought the prices were reasonable considering some of the prices for the other hotels in Waikiki. I was impressed that the hotel was so updated and the furniture was comfortable. We rented two 2-bedroom suites to accommodate 8. In my research I was not able to find these types of room configurations any place else in Waikiki. My husband and I shared one suite with my father, who is handicapped and he had the bathroom with the shower, which was perfect for him. He only had to step over the rim of the shower, however, he complained of the lighting in the bathroom to shave, but he also has macular degeneration. We stayed in the room with the King bed and private bath and there was a lot of storage, as well as an entrance from the room onto the side balcony. There was also a front balcony and the double doors opened wide. The view from the 22nd floor was outstanding in our suite which faced the marina and had a view of the sunset. I recommend this wing of the hotel. My brother's room was in the opposite wing had a view of the lagoon and the fireworks display, which is good for families with children. The suites offer two televisions, two full baths, a living area and dining area, two balconies and a full kitchen and breakfast bar. Since we only stayed one night, I can only state that the refrigerator worked well and the coffee was good. You have to buy your own dishwashing detergent, however. They offered a washer and a dryer where the ice machine and soda machine are located. They also offer a swimmer's elevator, for persons wet just coming off the beach or pool. We did use the washer and dryer and they worked well.The elevators were quick and we experienced no waiting, however, we visited Hawaii in October which is off season. We ate at the restaurant facing the marina and the food was adequate and the service was good. They have a market and you can buy snacks, personal items, souvenirs and alcohol, but there are two ABC stores very close to the hotel which offer better prices, and they sell everything from food to souvenirs! I recommend the ABC store to the left as you go out the front of the hotel, as they offer more.There is a McDonalds and Subway right across the street and I think I recall seeing Buffalo Wild Wings nearby too. The valet parking was expensive, but we got a military discount which made it affordable. They offer beach towels and beach chairs for your convenience, but it is a long walk to the beach or the lagoon. Our only complaint about the pool was you couldn't see the ocean from the pool area. The pool towel service was good and the loungers were comfortable and the water was perfect even in October. They have a chair that assists the handicapped into the pool. Overall I think this hotel is very handicapped assessable. There is an elevator at street level that can take a wheelchair or baby stroller to the hotel lobby level and they also have an escalator. We had no problems with the hotel watching our luggage as we shopped after we checked out. They even offer a post office to mail packages or post cards and sell what you need there at the store.I was told that the Ilikai is the hotel that they filmed the opening scene to the original Hawaii 5-0. It's too bad the hotel doesn't sell Hawaii 5-0 souvenirs there.","Hopewell, Virginia","jrmoxley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hopewell, Virginia</strong>",8,4.0

Unit 2030 is an owner rental which was handled/managed through Scott of Waikiki Oceanfront Rentals. Our experience is what it was and does not necessarily reflect on the entire building. The first thing that hits you when you walk in the door is the mildew smell, it was slightly better once the AC started to run. The AC turns off when you open the balcony door and is very sensitive, even with the door locked it would sometimes turn off, leaving the room warm and moldy smelling. This unit was not as advertised by Waikiki Oceanfront Rentals. The bedding super upgrade of memory foam mattress topper and pillows with 600 thread count sheets did not exist. The pillows were below average quality, no memory foam at all, bedding average. The advertised best view in the building is of the side of the Hilton, you can not see the ocean from the room unless you go outside and stand at the rail of the balcony and look to the right. You can not see the view sitting in the balcony chairs, there is a solid panel that blocks it while you are sitting. You can see the balconies of apparent owners, they had clothes lines and a lot of junk on them. The interior is nicely decorated, it is much smaller then what it looks like on the web-site. You get 7 hangers and a small basket cubby sort of dresser, did not find it useful. While taking a shower the water from the floor above started to drip on me, the ceiling drywall was severely sagging and was being held up by paint and it had stretched out to the point where the paint had small rips in it so water from the bath above was dripping on me while I was showering. I informed them of this obviously noticeable issue. So when we returned that afternoon the bathroom had a large, rotted out hole in in the ceiling where the drywall was removed and nothing was put back to cover the hole, not a piece of cardboard, nothing. We were instructed to go to another unit to shower. When I voiced my displeasure I received nasty, condescending emails from Waikiki Oceanfront. Not an offer to cover the hole or an apology. The Hotel itself seemed nice, the pool seemed okay, you have a short walk to the lagoon or beach in front of the Hilton, beach is rocky on the bottom. There is a nice restaurant on the top floor with good views, good food, good happy hour. The valet service was very good. Because it is a private condo you do not get any hotel services, such as cleaning, or the ability to move to another room when the one you are staying in has a problem.

We had a 'studio' which was one large room with a king bed, living area with television, kitchen area with pots, pans, dishes, etc., and bathroom with shower (no tub). It had granite counters, lovely decor, an entire wall of windows (we faced the mountains and cityscape) with sliding doors to a deck. We were on the 20th floor, so, even though we would have preferred an ocean view, the view we had was wonderful! My only complaint would be there was no dishwasher nor washer/dryer. There was a laundry room on each floor, but each machine took $2.50 to operate. Nevertheless, I would stay there again in a heartbeat! The location is fabulous! Just across the Ali Wai Canal from Honolulu, it is easy walking distance west to the Ala Moana Shopping Center, and city or beach walk east to all the charms of Waikiki. The remodel included new, high speed elevators. Each unit has its own air conditioner. The check in/out day was Saturday. The housekeeper does a complete cleaning, including changing the bed, on Monday. She picks up trash and replaces dirty towels on Thursday.

The renovations have been kept up nicely over the years. We stayed 7 nights on the 23rd floor. Our view was magnificent - the lagoon and the ocean and diamond head. The balcony (lanai) is HUGE compared to other hotels. The pool was great, clean, palm trees and umbrellas for shelter and lots of sunbeds, didnt have to fight for one at all. The restuarnt on top of the penthouse ""Sarento - Top of the I"" has a 360 degree breath taking view and is very reasonably priced for fine dining. There is also a cafe downstairs with yummy meals and a bar.

Ala Moana Shopping Centre is literally a 5 minute walk. The hotel is right on the marina and its very picturesque. The beach is beautiful, but a little rocky - but the lagoon is right below with its white sand and clear blue water, beautiful to swim in.The rooms are the largest I have stayed in, in the Waikiki area.

The suite had a full kitchen in which we utilized the fridge for our breakfasts and late night munchies. We had a family reunion cocktail party of 11 people in our little Hawaiin home. The other members booked regular hotel rooms that they enjoyed as well. This is the best value that I could find with an oceanview room on Waikiki. The hotel presented a hula show featuring a Hawaiin band and a very talented duo of dancers. This show was one of the highlights of our trip. The pool was a nice size- and enjoyed by the entire party. The only negatives were the inability to get drinks by the pool- this should be a must in the future, and the out of date fitness facility. I would recommend a transfer from the airport by Roberts or another private bus service(around 12 per person) because this is pretty much the first stop from the airport.

We arrived and the bellman accompanied us with our bags. The email I had from the owner indicated condo number 1638, so after several failed attempts with the lockbox, I think the bellman began to wonder what was up. I tipped the poor guy and asked him to leave the bags, and I promptly called one of the owners. Turns out he'd made a mistake on his email. After apologies from the owner, we went across the hall to condo 1637, and got in right away with the code they had provided. The last time I stayed a the Ilikai was in the 80's. I lived on Oahu, so I knew the property pretty well. The view from our lanai was gorgeous. It overlooks the marina and beyond. I have stayed in Waikiki many times since and this was probably the best view I've ever had. We arrived on Friday, so I had promised my son we would watch the fireworks over the lagoon from our lanai. Unfortunately, since we were now on the other side of the buidling, we couldn't see the fireworks. There are floorplans of the buildings on the Iliakai site, so you know, prior to getting there, which condo is facing what and now that we were actually in 1637, we didn't face the lagoon. We ended up walking down to the lagoon and watching from there. This particular unit was recently remodeled. The kitchen was very nice with just about anything you would need for a week. Who cooks when staying in Waikiki anyway? There is a full size fridge, which is nice but no icemaker or dishwasher. I got busy making ice right away. I began to unpack as my husband checked the place out. The T.V. remote didn't work, but that isn't a big deal for me. There are no instructions for a first time condo user. We didn't know if we were to call down to the desk or directly to the owners, if we needed something. Our son was sleeping on the fold out couch, but they provided no linens for that. There were no beach towels provided. The fitness room is for hotel guests only, so don't plan on using it. I was disappointed about that, as I work out almost every day. One whole wall of the condo is sliding doors. This provides for a lovely view, however, several of the vertical blinds were missing. 10 to be exact and when you have the Modern Hotel across the way, looking right into your condo, privacy can be an issue. My husband found a chest with some damged blinds that had been taken down and he repaired what he could. We ended up purchasing sheets to cover the sliders, so at least we had some privacy at night. Not really the thing you want to deal with on vacation. I showed my family the grounds, but I honestly don't recall such a disappointing pool and pool area. It is down right depressing. I recall spending many days at that pool back in the 80's, and I don't remember it looking like that. We never used the pool after that. The lagoon is a nice place for families to hang out and learn to stand up paddle board etc. Although once you get it down, rent over by the Outrigger Waikiki as it is much cheaper.The time difference can be a challenge, so I emailed the owners with our issues and they were very apologetic, insisting they would make it up to us and reimburse us for the sheets etc, but we haven't heard from them since. As a rental property owner myself, I realize it is difficult to manage a property in a whole other state, but it isn't fair to the renters, having to deal with missing window coverings, etc... Please also keep in mind that if you run out of towels, you are to wash them at your expense. We ran out of toilet tissue, and were never provided paper towels in the kitchen, and it is the guest's responsiblity to replace those as well. Just some little things that we were not aware of prior to our trip. We have never stayed in a condo on Oahu and would probably opt to stay in a hotel in the future. One other thing, the unit above us was undergoing some renovations, so we heard lots of drilling etc above us, but it was during the day.","Golden, CO","Limbogolden</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Golden, CO</strong>",64,4.0

We stayed in 512 which hack a fridge, microwave, stove, toaster, very nice walk in shower.

Hawaii Five-0 was shooting right on the beach beside this hotel which was amazing. Lots of small bars and restaurants near by with tons of happy hours (wild Wings and Snappers right across the street), Chart House (old school Waikiki style) is Aron d the corner.

As we travel from Australia and arrive early in the morning we always pay for accommodation the night before arrival to ensure that we can go straight to our room on arrival and have a sleep and rest. It was therefore disappointing to arrive and find that whilst the condo was an ocean front condo on a high floor, construction work was being undertaken on both condos next to the one we were allocated. You can understand my annoyance that we would be on holiday in a construction site (the corridor outside our room had plastic covering to stop the debris etc messing up the carpet) and that management made no mention of this at the time of making the reservation nor at check-in. I promptly went back to the reception and complained about this. They explained that as the condos are privately owned they have no control over the construction work - whilst I accept this, I do believe that they should advise their guests that construction work is occurring especially when you are paying in excess of $USD500 (incl taxes) per night. I explained that I would not be able to stay in the condo and wanted to be moved to an alternative one.Donna, at reception was very understanding and advised that she would see what could be done. In order for us to rest after our flight they put us in a studio to rest (which we did) and in the early afternoon were advised that we had a new condo - 2544. All better, all resolved - much appreciated.Condo 2544 was great. Normally on our visits to Waikiki we stay in one bedroom ocean front suites with the major hotel chains, but thought we would try a condo. Compared to these, the condo offered great value for money. We were not disappointed with our choice, the view was marvelous and the condo had everything we needed. Both the lounge and beds were comfortable. The condo was looking a bit tired, but this did not worry us at all. The fireworks from our lanai were terrific, and listening the hula show from the Hilton next door was fun.The location of the Ilikai is terrific, at the quieter end of the strip - we have now decided this is our preferred location. It is within walking distance to the Ala Moana shopping centre and all the hustle and bustle of downtown Waikiki without the ongoing noise.In respect to restaurants, would recommend Roy's - always reliable and consistent and La Mer at the Halekulani for that special occasion.We would stay at the Ilikai again and would ask for condo 2544. thanks for a great stay.","Canberra, Australia","greg637</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",21,5.0

There is free internet connection which is so essential these days. We love that there are even light beach chairs provided which we can easily carry to the beach - that was thoughtful.

I booked Ilikai based on the reviews and the ""reasonable"" price for a July stay. I left because, despite my cool view of the city on the 25 out of 26 floors, the bathroom was so old, dark and moldy, I just didn't want to take a shower in in. After a day at the beach, that is all you want to do. It had shower curtains that I didn't even dare open and the fixtures look like they had been from the 60s with the mold to boot. The room itself was big, and the bed looked great, until I got under the sheets. The sheets were made of some material that felt like a cousin to the material you use on shower curtains. Not quite vinyl, but not cotton either. They were not soft and I didn't want to touch them. I would like to give one prop to the lovely Hawaiian clerk who checked me in at reception. She was very nice, let me check in early, but gave me the wrong internet access card. By the time I realized it wasn't my phone that was in error, I was ready to leave anyway. The ""cheaper"" hotel restaurant menu had about 5 items on it ""due to new ownership we are just starting to build our menu"" and the other Italian restaurant was too expensive.The location was good and bad . I learned, being new to Oahu ,I am NOT a Waikiki lover. It is too crowded & busy. The scene at the end Ilikai is at are less busy, but the sand is like cement and the hotel is not ON the beach. You have to walk down a street sidewalk, past the harbor, past the SMOKERS' area (no other way) through the kiddie area around the Hiton Hawaiian Village, and then you are on the beach. The pool at Ilikai looked small and uninviting. The baggage service/bell hop was smug and didn't move until you handed him money.If you are a family, this is a huge hotel and has a convenience store right in the lobby, so that is the one good thing to grab last minute whatever you need...That said, NO IDEA what everyone else loves.

The information desk was staffed by different people - on one occasion, extremely helpful and knowledgeable, on another, not nearly as knowledgeable.The restaurant / grill was adequate, with casual service (rather than attentive), although the servers still expected full tips for below average attention.

We rented the apartment through Ali'i Beach Rentals. Because of this I can't really comment on service aspects of the hotel itself as we didn't require any. We had two families of 3 staying there. One family with a 5yr old girl the other with a 16 yr old girl. The 6 of us were together for the first 5 nights, 2 then left leaving 4 of us (3 adults and the 5yr old) for the remaining 6 nights.Location: It was great for what we wanted to do (spend time with each other and my wife wanted to shop!) but requires an approx 1 mile walk to get to central Waikiki which generally wasn't a problem but I did have to carry our 5 year old a few times. The very large Ala Moana Shopping Centre was a 10min walk and it had numerous family friendly dining options as well as a vast array of shops (from low to high end).Amenities: The apartment was well stocked with both bath and beach towels, more than ample for the 6 of us. There was plenty of crockery and cutlery provided. We never cooked and really just ate breakfast in the apartment. The starter portions of soaps, shampoo etc provided were handy and allowed us time to get to a grocery store.Layout: The apartment is one contains one central living area which includes a dining area, lounge/TV area and kitchen. At either end of this area are the bedrooms. One bedroom had a queen bed, the other had two singles. Each bedroom had its own bathroom. Problems/Issues:1. Being two bedrooms it meant that the ""children"" had to share the inflatable bed in the living area. Generally it wasn't a problem but it did mean the only place the adults could converse when the 5yr old had gone to bed was the balcony. After 2 nights of this we made a bed in one of the rooms using cushions from the lounges for the younger child. 2. The living area was airconditioned via two large wall mounted units, however the bedrooms were not airconditioned. What we chose to do at night was to leave the balcony doors open and allow the night breeze through. This also meant that street noise was more than audible which generally wasn't a problem with the exception of Fri and Sat nights when it was noticably louder. Not doing this meant the room would get stuffy very quickly.3. The carpet was a very light brown/beige colour and in the living areas it was in need of a very good clean (this is the main reason for the average cleanliness rating otherwise it was very good). Hardflooring here may be a better option.Other Information/tips: 1. The view from one of the balconies was spectacular and provided a great setting to watch the 4th of July fireworks. There are weekly fireworks at the adjacent Hilton Lagoon but you can't see them from the balconies.2. The 17th floor had a coin operated laundry which we used a few times. Make sure you save your quarters for this! :-)3. Get a savings card for the Foodland store at the Ala Moana Shopping Centre (all that was needed was a US Phone number, the apartment has a phone and you canm use its number however we used a Cell phone number).All in all both families agreed that we would stay here again (Honolulu is a location that is roughly half way between Perth, Western Australia and Philidelphia and is great holiday location) and that being able to all stay in the one location represented great value.","Perth, Australia","11sjw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",27,4.0

So, after my complaining, Chester upgraded us to a newly remodeled room (""just released""). A big improvement! We also really disliked the concierge service that was relentlessly trying to get us to sign up for their time share orientation.

It's a great hotel, great staff, and the location cannot be beat. We stayed on the 23rd floor, ocean view room and had an amazing westerly view of the Ala Wai Boat Harbor and the ocean beyond. This hotel is just the right mix of old and new. It's not too posh, or stuffy, but still very nice. The staff is helpful, friendly and tries very hard to meet your needs. It's very convenient to have the bus and trolley stops right outside the front of the hotel. The ground level restaurant leaves a bit to be desired (although the coffee shop was fine) and the Italian restaurant at the top of the hotel is very good, but a bit pricey. Good for a special occasion. It's handy to be so close to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (right next door) as they have more eating options. Try the Tropics Bar & Grill - good food, waterfront view and live music.

We chose the Ilikai to be out of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki but near enough to enjoy it. Room was very large with two double beds and lots of room to spare. Wide lanai(balcony) gave us an amazing view of the marina and ocean. Pool was nice and deep, but roped off shallow end for younger and novice swimmers. Nearby pool house for showers was a plus - a bit dated but nice to be able to shower before heading back to the room on the 23rd floor. (A woman who owns one of the condos at Ilikai said that they would soon be updating the pool house within the year.) Fireworks were visible from rooms ending in 16-26. We were on the ground a block away and enjoyed the show. Beautiful lobby and entrance, shuttles stop right out front for convenience in getting to Waikiki and beyond. Did not need a car and used taxi to get to and from airport. Another plus was being able to check in early. Our room was available so we were in before noon.

Overall, we were quite happy with our choice. The Ilikai is a bit removed from all the hustle and bustle of the center of Waikiki. It is about a half hour walk to most of the shops and restaurants. Although there are closer options as well. The lobby and public areas were nice. As a condo visitor, you have to be abit more assertive to get some information from the valet, concierge etc. But everyone was pleasant. Note--they do have a luggage elevator/conveyor belt so you don't need to schlep your luggage up and down the steps or escalator. Just ask for assistance! Condo users are charged a dollar or two a bag for the hotel to hold the luggage if you need to check out before your flight. It is a relatively short walk to the beach, but it is a walk...and you might get jealous of the Hilton next door and all their lovely amenities! Anyway, this particular condo had a nice view of the lagoon and ocean (though not a direct sunset view, for those who care). You could also see and hear the Hilton's nightly luau, though it isn't terribly disturbing. The condo had a pretty comfortably king bed, with flat, uncomfortable pillows. The bathroom was very nice, and the kitchen and living room were well decorated, with enough places to put all your stuff. However, oddly, there didn't seem to be any living room lights except in the bookcase area...so no way to read a book on the couch. Lighting is a pet peeve of mine. The wireless internet was good, and also worked on the lanai. The chairs on the lanai were comfortable. .I don't recall ever hearing any other guests, so I guess the soundproofing is okay! Their are laundry facilities on the floor, near the elevators. The kitchen glasses were spotty and I didn't care to use them. They provide 2 beach towels, but could either have provided more, or had a plusher set. The basic soap, etc they leave you with were fine for us, but I would have liked to have more tissues and a roll of paper towels, and some more items in the kitchen pantry. Waikikoceanfrontrentals were great to work with. I love the fact that the door had a combination lock, so you didn't have to worry about carrying keys.We rented a car two separate days from Alamo right across the street....it was easier than renting two days and then having to pay for parking overnight! The beach in front of the hilton is just okay. You need sand shoes. The sand is coarse and if you go swimming, there are stones and rocks on the bottom. The lagoon was weirdly colder than the ocean.","Allentown, Pennsylvania","travellerfromatown</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Allentown, Pennsylvania</strong>",371,4.0

After holding off till practically the last month of the duration of the coupon, We decided to try out one of the Aqua properties. Our first choice was the Best Western Coconut, but sadly, Aqua no longer carried them as of June 1, 2012. Our next choice was actually a toss up between the Ilikai and the Aqua Bamboo. Because the Bamboo is on the main busy strip of Kuhio, we decided to go with the Ilikai Hotel, had requested a high floor. Since we live on Oahu anyway, we wanted to just take advantage of trying to check in early. We were told guest parking was valet only and was told a rate of $25.00. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted pretty quickly with the personable Jeremy. He advised us that we would have in and out privileges and that the valet could be charged to the room. He later directed us to where we needed to go to check in. He was very friendly and didn't make us feel rushed, even though there were a few people waiting for their cars. We were quickly received at the front desk by a smiling and friendly Rizelle. She quickly found our reservation and explained to us about the beach towel and beach chair services. I thought that was pretty cool that a hotel would offer those services, and at no cost at all. Provided you returned them promptly. To my surprise, I did get a high floor, and boy was it high. We got the 25th floor, one floor short of the penthouse. But we were happy!The hotel lobby was very clean and airy. I knew they renovated and was pretty happy with what we've seen so far. Entering the room, we were amazed at how large the room was! It was clean and was very presentable. Mind you, Ilikai is not a luxury, so we weren't expecting that. But for what they offer and the price, we were extremely happy. The free room coupon was for a standard run of the house. What we got was a high floor, mountain view room. The view, although not oceanview, was still pretty good. If we had checked in the day before, we would have been able to view the Kamehameha parade down below on Ala Moana Blvd. We went downstairs to check out the pool. After checking with the concierge, she directed us to the pool area. The Ilikai shares the lobby deck with The Modern pool so we were somewhat confused. Ilikai's pool was pretty disappointing. Compared to the Modern next door it's rather small and enclosed. There were quite a few kids that day so there was no room for swimming. We decided to just go to the beach at the Hilton Lagoon for the rest of the day. All in all, we were pleasantly surprised. We would definitely stay here again.","Honolulu, Hawaii","rodel c</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",1,4.0

My parents stayed in a studio condo and my daughters family and I stayed in a 2 bedroom condo. Both units were very clean, comfortable, and modern. The two bedroom condo was unit 1334 and it was beautiful. Two bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, kitchen, living room, double lanai, 3 flat screen TV's, and plenty of storage space. One bathroom had a shower while the other had a tub/shower (and a badet:) The studio unit 1412 was also beautiful but definitely smaller and more fit for a couple. It had a kitchen, 2 queen beds, pull out couch and shower. Both of our condos had a ocean/marina view and we watched the fireworks from the lanais. The security at the Ilikai was top rate. We had 3 small children under age 10 and felt safe and secure. The Ilikai is definitely more laid back than some of the other hotels but not in a bad way. It is situated so that you aren't in the middle of the Waikiki chaos but you can walk or drive quickly there if you want to experience it. I really can't say enough great things about Ilikai.

If you are looking for a modern updated hotel this is not for you. The decor is in dire need of an update. The outside grounds are pleasant but was just lacking that wow factor. When we walked off the elevator to our room we were overcome by a smell of a nursing home, for a lack of a better term. The carpet in the hallway was old and we felt like were in a bad apartment building. Walking into our room we were greeted by a huge refrigerator to our right. Weird place for a fridge. The unit is small(which we knew) with Ikea type furniture. The sofa bed is a futon not a bed. The coffee table is old and outdated. The double beds are also very uncomfortable as I am pretty sure they were bought at Ikea as well. The kitchen is nice with newer appliances, but no toaster as stated on their website. The bathroom vanity is very small with no room to place any of your toiletries. The shower is ok but looked like they needed to clean better in the corners. Was turning black just a few days into our stay. The balcony had plastic tables and chairs, but a great view of the ocean. I think that might have been the most redeeming quality. The website says that their is ocean views by the pool, WRONG! There is no ocean views as it is blocked by trees and foliage. Maybe the trees are put there so the cigarette smokers can have some privacy. This was so gross. All the smokers congregate by the outside pool wall and smoke. So make sure you sit at the opposite end of the pool. The pool is extremely small and warm. We are in Hawaii where the water should be a little cold. Just not refreshing. If you want a drink you can walk all the way around the outside of the building to get to the bar. There is a bar attendant but had to go and get her. We did not eat at the Bar and Grill as we were afraid after seeing the pool. This hotel was just not up to par. We were looking to save a few bucks by staying in a condo but will pay the extra money next time for room service and clean sheets every day.","Huntington Beach, California","caligirl280</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntington Beach, California</strong>",9,3.0

We love the location--walking distance to Ala Moana Beach Park and the Ala Moana Mall--and the retro vibe. We started staying there when we were in our twenties and we appreciated being on the quiet end of Waikiki at that time; we were happy to see the place is still that way.

The location was good, near buses (many buses stop right outside, lots more accessible from the Ala Moana shopping center). Being on the ocean side meant our room was fairly quiet, though we did hear noise from room upstairs at times. Basic cable only, no movies or on-demand programs. The lobby is gorgeous, but the room itself was a bit decrepit -- there was a big hole in bathroom wall (see picture), a hole in the screen that you can pull partway across between bed and TV area, the shag carpet smelled moldy. There was no bathtub, shower floor was seriously stained and grubby-looking. The king-sized bed was comfortable, all the linens were clean. Kitchen has stove and oven and dishwasher as well as fridge and microwave; but, they provide you with some very old and bent silverware, and we ended up not using the dishwasher because there was no dishwasher soap provided. Really great view from the lanai. Other negatives: the sofa by the TV was uncomfortable, scratchy and cheap, curved so that two people sitting on it can't find a comfortable way to put their legs. The AC unit is placed so that it blows directly into your face when you're sitting on the sofa. Strangely super-cheap, bad quality TP and tissues. Don't be fooled by the ""in-room dining"" button on the phone, there is no room service.The worst thing about the Ilikai was the service, which was downright surly (example: I forgot our beach towel cards in the room when we checked out, and they insisted I go back upstairs and get them; when I went to pick up ""welcome packet"" -- just some coupons for burger restaurants -- the concierge was on the phone with someone and basically just tossed the coupons at me).

Would definitely stay again! We walked in with our luggage and were greeted by an extremely friendly staff at the front desk. We arrived at noon, but could not check in until 3pm. However, the hotel was happy to store our luggage for us in a locked room and, upon return, the staff brought our bags up to our room for us and filled up our ice chest voluntarily. The staff always had a smile on their face and treated us like royalty (despite the fact that we're both grad students in our mid-twenties). We had asked for a high floor with a Hilton lagoon and ocean view, and were given a great room on the 24th floor with a terrific view of both. The room was huge, at least as big as our friends' rooms at the Hilton (and for half the price). The bed was comfortable, the TV was a large flat screen mounted on the wall, and the bathroom was large with a separate bath and shower. The terrace was much larger than I imagined- it would have easily fit 10 people comfortably, maybe 15.Upon asking the valet service how to get a taxi to take us to Pearl Harbor, I was informed by the valet representative that his dad ran a limo service that costs the same as a taxi, and he would just call them to pick us up. Sure enough, a white limousine arrived at the hotel and took us to Pearl Harbor for the same price as a taxi to the airport (about $40.00 with tip). The crew also sent another limo to pick us up from Pearl Harbor after our visit. Never had to wait.The hallways were clean and vacuumed every day. The elevators were fully functional and quick. The bar and grill downstairs had decent food and drink prices, but the service was just... meh. Not anything to write home about, but not bad at all.We never visited the pool because we're just across the way from the beach, a very easy walk around the Hilton lagoon. The area was safe and well monitored. The location is extremely convenient. The Royal Hawaiian Shopping center is a 10-15 minutes walk, and everything worth doing on the beach was within 20 minutes. We only rented for a couple of days to drive the back way to North Shore (highly recommended!)On our last day, our flight did not depart until 11pm. The Ilikai was happy to accomodate us with a late check out of 2pm, and then allow us to store our bags for the rest of the day for free in the above-referenced room. Upon dropping our bags off, the staff voluntarily set up a shuttle to pick us up later that evening and take us to the airport for only $20, cutting the cost of a taxi in half.I am entirely satisfied with my experience at the Ilikai, and will definitely stay again!","Dallas, Texas","TechLaw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",3,5.0

Also, my bed was a bit too firm for my taste.Area-wise, the good news is that you're off the beaten Waikiki path, but the bad news is that you're off the beaten Waikiki path.

The property is, mercifully, far enough away from Waikiki proper that you won't have to deal with the Vegas-by-the-beach set, but eating options are more limited than at hotels further east.

The hotel was easy to find and everyone right from the parking guys out front were so friendly and helpful. Check-in was a breeze. We had several questions for the concierge about places we wanted to visit and he was great - gave us tons of good information.We were extremely pleased with the location of our room. It was one floor before the penthouse, I think it was the 24th floor. The Hilton hotel next door has fireworks every Friday night. Our stay was on a Friday and I really hoped to see the fireworks. When I checked in the they told us they'd given us an ocean view room overlooking the Hilton so that we could watch the fireworks. It was really nice that they did that without being asked. When we got up to the room we were very pleased with the size of the room. It was really large. The balcony was fabulous, it was huge! It was so nice sitting on the balcony with a bottle of wine watching the fireworks on such a beautiful night. We also had a view of Diamond Head, so the location couldn't be beat.The room itself wasn't in the best of shape. The carpet had some stains on it. I have no complaints about the beds - they were spotless and comfortable. The bathroom was the biggest problem area. It was a big bathroom. It had a bathtub/shower combo and sink with large counter when you first walk into it, then a closed off area with a toilet and another shower. The bathtub/shower combo looked like it had been replaced fairly recently and was in good shape. However, the toilet and the stand-alone shower were really old. The tiles on the bottom of it were kind of gross... I wouldn't have stood on it for anything. In the middle of the night when the toilet was used, it wouldn't stop running. My husband had to get up at 2:00 a.m. and take the lid off the tank and fix it. It happened every time we used it. The bottom line is the rooms are a little tired. I certainly wouldn't have wanted to stay in the room for any more than a night or two.

Not our first time to Hawaii but our first time at this hotel. The hotel has both good and bad points but overall it is a great place to stay.First the good: Room size - had an ocean view room on 23rd floor - view of the beach can't be beaten and the balcony is generous - great place to have breakfast or just relax with a drink to watch the ocean. The room itself had a marvellous armchair for watching TV - overall just a very comfortable environment for winding down. A fridge, microwave and coffee maker are also there if you don't want to go out. The bathroom had a bath, separate shower and toilet which these days you don't find in more modern rooms. The furnishings were in good conditions and housekeeping was spot on. Downstairs the lobby area has a cafe selling takeaway items and a shop with provisions for the room.Location: A 10 minute walk will have you back in the main restaurant zone. At night this is definitely a positive as the main street is very noisy especially on the weekend. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Ala Moana shopping centre which also has many dining options and great shopping.Now the negatives: There are few options for eating within the hotel - you need to go father afield. The entrance may also be a problem for some - there is an elevator but it is tucked away so you need to ask where it is if the stairs are difficult. As for the escalator at the front - it is either under maintenance or turned off most of the time. (I have been here on 4 different occasions in the last 6 months and this has been the case)Overall, I would recommend this hotel - it is rather like staying in someone's home - familiar and comfortable.","Sydney, Australia","Wendy H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",101,4.0

From a certain spot, where we renewed our vows, you could see the Hotel in the background, the Lagoon, and all of Waikiki down to Diamond Head. It really was magical.

We were not told on check in and there was just a small sign at the restaurant. We were going to have dinner there on the first night but the way the hostess spoke to us when we asked if we had to book was if they weren't expecting many people anyway which turned us off. We had thought about eating there on another night or for lunch, but the next morning when we went down to get a coffee there was a sign saying closed for renovations for 2 weeks, Again would have been nice if reception could have told us or there was a message put on the messaging system.3 - Coffee machine in hotel pretty awful and there was no kettle to make tea, thankfully there was a coffee shop downstairs which did espresso coffee, Plus the only glasses in the room were in the bathroom and there was a microwave but no plates or eating utensils which seemed a bit oddOverall if you are looking for a nice hotel, in a quieter but still central location which is of good value would highly recommend","Melbourne, Australia","kirstyjb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",60,4.0

However if you plan to walk to the beaches, shopping and restaurants and are looking for a spacious and relatively quiet spot then consider the Ilikai. Yes, I've stayed in more luxurious hotels but this place was perfect for our needs - 2 bedrooms and more importantly 2 bathrooms were a must with 4 women! The kitchen and living room also came in handy and were especially nice given that we were here a week. We had an ocean view room on the 25th floor - the view was magical day and night.

It was tastefully decorated, well appointed, clean and came with an amazing view. It was nice to have a kitchen with a full size fridge. The hotel has a lovely salt water pool, although no flotation devices were allowed or toys, which made it difficult for children that could not swim or wanted to play. Special exceptions were made upon request if a flotation device was required.We will definitely be making a return trip and we will definitely be staying at the Ilikai again, however I am not certain I would book with Waikiki Oceanfront Rentals again. Although booking the condo was easy, this is definitely a self-help rental agent. Any questions we had, we were told to look on the website as the website would have all we needed to know. If I could have found it on the website easily I wouldn't have asked the question in the first place. Half way through our trip the shower drain stopped working in our condo and we were left with no shower. Although we were offered another room to shower in and later on offered another room (on the other side of the complex and without the view we had paid for) to move into, there was no mention of a refund or partial refund for our inconvenience. This is still a matter that needs to be addressed with the owner and I will keep you posted on if a full or partial refund was provided. The location of the condo was perfect. We were at the start of Waikiki Beach and at the end of Ala Moana Beach. With the Marina located right in front. Within the complex itself there are 3 restaurants: The Chart House Steak House – Very expensive and the food was just okay. Red Lobster Steak House – Reasonably priced, great food and great service (takes a very long time to get seating as it is so busy). Outback Steak House – Good food, great service and quick seating.Across the street from the complex is an ABC store and kitty corner from the complex is a McDonalds. A block and a half up is the Ala Moana Shopping Centre that has more restaurants, great shopping and a grocery store. And just behind the Ala Moana Shopping Centre and across the street is a Wal-Mart. Although Waikiki can be very expensive, we found several alternatives that required little to no out of pocket expense.The Hilton Hawaiian Village Lagoon is open to the pubic. Great place to take the children swimming. It is a man made lagoon that is approximately 6ft deep at the center of the lagoon. No need to worry about big waves. The Hilton has beach equipment available for rent as well. There are also many shops available within the Hilton Hawaiian Village along with koi ponds and other animal displays, such as parrots, penguins, flamingo’s and turtles. This is all open to the public to see and enjoy. Magic Island at the Ala Moana Beach was a great place to take the children as well. It has a protected swimming area and the views were amazing.The Honolulu Zoo was fairly in-expensive. The kids enjoyed seeing all the animals. However I found the Zoo not what it used to be 20 years ago and was disappointed. The aquarium was also nice and in-expensive to visit.The US Army Museum of Hawaii, this museum is free to visit and relies on donations. The museum has exhibits and educational programs emphasizing the role Hawaii played in military actions from WWI through the Vietnam Conflict. Very educational and an interesting tour.We did do some planned tours with Oahu Spot Tours. Our tour guide, (although I prefer to call him friend) Ron was amazing. We did an Island Tour that was awesome. As this was a private tour, there was no sharing bus space or having to wait for people or be hurried at any one particular sight. He was informative, and shared his knowledge of the island, its people and their philosophy. I left the tour with a better understanding and a greater appreciation for the island, its people, history and its culture. We also did a City Tour with Ron. We visited the Flea Market at the Stadium, Pearl Harbor, we visited historical sights that included the first Church on Oahu made of coral and the Iolani Palace. Our final destination on the tour was the Puu Ualaokua Park View Point. Stunning views of Oahu and Waikiki can be found here. There is a lovely place for a picnic or a rest. Definitely a highlight of the trip.Ron also shuttled us out to our Whale Watching/Snorkel excursion with Wild Side Hawaii - http://sailhawaii.com/index.html. Captain Downing was friendly and experienced and genuinely interested in the animals and their surroundings. He did not act in an aggressive manner trying to pursue the animals. Ashley our shipmate and Paul our photographer were amazing. There is not enough good things I could say about this tour and would go again with them. Thank you for the lovely experience.We found that 2 weeks was not enough to see and do everything that we wanted to do on the island. It was just enough to tease us into wanting more!Mahalo","Whitehorse, Canada","YukonAngel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whitehorse, Canada</strong>",11,3.0

The staff was very friendly and eager to please. It was a pleasure to meet the manager, Terry Dowsett. He went above and beyond any expectations to be sure we were satisfied with our accommodations. The hotel continues to get updates and was undergoing a new paint job on the exterior. I really like the large rooms and divided bathrooms (two showers)! The microwave, small fridge and coffe maker is a real bonus. The outdoor Grill/Bar served really good food and especially the Mahi sandwich and salads were great. Very nice place to sit and watch the sunset. The large terrace provides the setting for the Friday night Hula show and fireworks. Even with the rain, they moved inside to the huge lobby for the hula show with chairs and sofas to seat everyone. A very nice evening at no cost! There are lots of good restaurants all around in walking distance. While I do enjoy going to the ""heart of Waikiki"" to stroll around, it is always refreshing to return to the peace and beauty of the Ilikai.

The front desk staff were always friendly and very helpful with suggestions. They helped book shuttles, find restaurants, etc. They even remembered us after awhile--not easy, considering there are hundreds of people staying here. Another plus was the close proximity to the Hilton lagoon and beach. This is especially fantastic if you have young swimmers. The lagoon is an easy walk from the hotel and perfect for wading with kids. We had a few days of rain and the temperature dropped to lower 70s. Very happy with the warm pool at the hotel.

This unit lived up to our expectations and we are very satisfied in our decision to stay here. The unit was very clean and had plenty of space for the two of us. We took advantage of the full kitchen to prepare our own breakfasts on most mornings. Although there are also plenty of restaurant's within easy walking distance if you'd rather eat out.  The location was good for us because it is at the North end of Waikiki Beach which is a quieter location then the ""Central"" beach area. Watching the Hilton Hawaiian Friday Night Fireworks from our lanai was a treat and you are only a short walk away from everything else that Waikiki has to offer.  The only improvement we could suggest is that the owner really needs to update the television set. I know you don't go on a vacation to Hawaii to watch TV. But, for those times in the evening when your relaxing before bed or in the morning when you would like to see what the local weather and/or news is, the TV is an important part of your stay. This is an old unit with a remote that only works occasionally. (even with new batteries) With the price of flat screen HD units now-a-days, an upgrade would be a great addition to a really nice condo for a very minimal cost. The Ilikai is a very nice hotel. Clean, quiet and very comfortable. They have several shops and a bar area that also serves some tasty lunch and dinner meals.

I am sure that experiences can vary greatly as the condos are all owned and decorated by different people. This particular condo is a corner suite so we had 2 balconies, one with a view of the marina and the other had city views. We were also very happy that this area isn't right in the middle of the busy section of Waikiki, but it's close enough to walk to and enjoy all the shops and restaurants on the way. Another big plus for staying here is it's really close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center, less than 10 mins walk in fact. The only negative I can think of is that internet coverage was not ideal in this suite. It is provided by the hotel, however we were told our problems stemmed from how far away our rooms were from the server. We eventually discovered that if we moved the computer to the kitchen bench, we were able to get a signal from there, and could use it. Fun fact - the Illikai is where the original Hawaii 50 was shot with Steve McGarrett at the top.

Our famiy of four ( two teenagers) were very comfortable in our bachelor st condo. Our room had been updated, but there are some dated areas in building. There are plans for more updates to come. We stayed in an ocean view room that overlooked the Hilton Lagoon. You could sit on the lanai and watch the sunset and the Friday night fireworks next door at the Hilton. The Ilikai is at the end of Waikiki beach, so is not near the crazy busy Beachwalk but is a short walk down the beach if that is where you want to spend your time. We did not use the pool, we preferred the beach, but the pool appeared to be very popular. The only things I would change about the stay, would be a dishwasher in the room and washing machines that worked better.I would definitely stay there again.","Moose Jaw, Canada","sask_traveler_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Moose Jaw, Canada</strong>",3,4.0

I arrived at the hotel with reservations; however I was welcomed as though I was already a guest. Initially, I was given a room with a mountain view, but I was really hopeful for an ocean view room. I called the front desk to request a change and was politely told I needed to speak to a manager. I was given the phone number to the manager on duty which was Mr. Terry. I called Mr. Terry and he was very attentive to my concern and told me he’d get back with me as soon as possible with an answer. Within a few minutes, I heard a knock at my door and it was Mr. Terry. He told me an ocean view room was available and asked if I would like to see it? I said yes, and immediately he showed me the room. Upon first glance I was very pleased with the ocean view room, however Mr. Terry extended his hospitality by showing me how to operate the air/heating, he volunteered some very helpful tourist information and asked if I thought I’d be comfortable?I’m a frequent traveler and have stayed at various four and five star hotels, but I’ve never received red carpet treatment as delivered by Mr. Terry. I’d like to personally thank him and the Llikai Hotel Staff for a wonderful stay. The room was very nice and clean. It is in a very good location for restaurant and shopping. I enjoyed every moment. The temperature in the room was great not too cool and not too warm. The air condition was located in the sitting area.

We were really pleased with our 6 nights there - the suite was spacious, had amazing views of the Hilton Lagoon and out to the ocean. We splashed out on the oceanview room and it didn't disappoint. Two huge lanais with comfortable chairs and tables on each - and the sunset was gorgeous. The second bedroom is only separated from the dining by sliding louvre doors which didn't completely close and we had to keep quiet with our light sleeping children. One of the showers was on the weak side but apart from that the bathroom amenities were up to par. We were provided with a metal crib for our baby but unfortunately no bedding - we called and they gave us a pillow and king sized blanket so I would recommend taking your own - other hotels have always supplied sheets and blankets in the past. The only thing the kitchen was missing was an electric kettle, we had to boil water in a pan to make a cup of tea each morning. As for the hotel - they were helpful (apart from the 8.20am call on our first morning after an 8 hour flight - just to tell us we had a welcome pack waiting to be delivered, gee thanks for that) and when we had a problem with a leaking a/c making the carpet soaking wet, we had housekeeping arrive and remedy the problem within 15 minutes. The shop downstairs had most grocery items (except for swim diapers) and while we didn't dine in for any meals, the restaurant seemed to have a good range on the menu. My only complaint was regarding the pool - the attendant was a complete killjoy and stopped my husband from lifting our 4 year old into the air and making a little splash. No toys allowed either! Heaven forbid we actually had FUN!! The pool area is about to be upgraded but its fairly cosmetic - a few plans, new tiles, a pergola, etc. Really they need to have a separate kids pool so the grumpy people can stick to their own area and not send evil glances our way. As for the location, the Ilikai was ideal for local shops, the Hilton restaurants, the lagoon and breakfast/lunch outlets. Our favourite was the Wailana Coffee Lounge across from the Hilton which was sooo cheap, quick and the food was excellent. I would recommend that the owners of the Ilikai do something about the exterior of the building - rusty, green, peeling. Really tired-looking. We would definitely return to the Ilikai, it was good value for money.","Auckland, New Zealand","DemiLuneNZ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",38,4.0

Sounds great right? Wrong!First of all when my family and I pulled up, my teens said,""Mom is this a motel?"", ""What made you book this place?"" I told them, ""well look, the sign in front says newly renovated rooms, so maybe they didn't get to the outside yet. The reviews were all positive, and the reservation lady told me we will really be happy and enjoy this hotel."" Well, first of all, they pre-charged our credit card for the first night, normal, but when we arrived they placed a $300 hold on our card for room security. I'm thinking this must be some kind of renovated room and it just has to be great. Well, on the way to room noticed all the old doors, walked in room to find.....old white fridge like one I grew up with. Old dirty, filthy white microwave, old cabinets, new counter top; old carpet; wall paper peeling off wall over one of the beds in first room; bathrooms have new counter tops with old tubs; bed old; very old sliding doors that lead to very old balcony with ocean and lagoon views. New t.v. with poor picture quality in living room and 2nd bedroom. I stayed up all night researching online for another hotel. Checked out the next morning, and front desk person asked my husband was everyone out the room, he said, yes, and then he was told they will complete the check-out and take $300 hold off card once they check the room and make sure everything is ok, so please have a seat and we will call you back to counter when clear. WOW! What the heck! Were there hidden diamonds and gold in the room that I missed? Was that old lamp an antique worth thousands? Incredible, anyway, we drove right over to The Kahala Hotel & Resort (review to follow) a true diamond and pot of gold on the island for the remainder of our 5 day stay. Pay & stay at your own risk!

IT was 'Brilliant' value & the rooms were spacious and location perfect for visiting the Ala Moana Centre. During our stay which was peak season we had to change rooms on 3 occasions as this was the only way to get a room at this Hotel which was completely booked out at this time of the year. Even although we booked in advance we were still in a position whereby we had to change rooms, so if you want to stay here book WELL in advance.The Hotel is obviously one of the originals and hence it is of an older vintage which in fact makes it much more enjoyable. The rooms are LARGE!! seriously. The beds too. The decor is very comfortable, compliments the era. The Lobby is lovely and the restaurant downstairs on the Lobby floor is exceptionally good & exceptionally good value!!.The staff here are amazing. Trust the Americans to do it so well>>>SERVICE that is, something that Australians would do very well to learn more about as generally we have a lot to learn from our allies over there on this topic. The front desk staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful; we needed to change rooms on a number of occasions and they were flawless in their preparations. The maid service is also excellent. Please TIP them as they rely on this to boost wages; plus they are generally very good at what they do. Different teams work on different floors though so be aware of who the maid is for your room during your stay. They replentish the coffee- perculator- Hawaiian brands - not our taste- and clean the room perfectly.The location is truly excellent away from the bustle & hustle of central Waikiki and walk to Ala Moana Beach & Shopping Centre plus surrounded by brilliant restaurants and Hilton Hawaiian Village.I was recovering from major surgery _Total Hip replacement , yet managed to walk daily to Ala Moana and down the beach to Waikiki with teenage daughter so if I can do it so can most. The quiet location is very important and if you take a room with a view- we did for a few days- the atmosphere is exceptional.The City view Mountain view rooms are also nice, especially value wise. Truly this Hotel has to be recommended not only for the excellent value (especially compared to Australia @ just over $120 per night~ PLUS the truly BRILLIANT professional staff, the spacious airy & light well maintained rooms, and the very lovely lobby and restaurants. You can book bargain prices via the various online booking agents. We found a very good one & got a great deal. We will DEFINITELY stay again. Absolutely.

The thing to remember is that the building is divided into 3rd's. One third is the hotel, one third is owned condo's, and the last third are condo rentals. I can't comment on the hotel or lived in rooms other than the quick look you get when walking down the hall when they are being cleaned, but they did look more dated than 1318.Condo 1318 that I arranged through Waikiki Oceanfront Rentals (Scott) was completely updated in 2007. Once you walk in through the door you wouldn't know the building was old. The floors had all been redone, new kitchen, new appliances, walk in showers in both bath rooms, the master had a 10 jet hot tub, 2 flat screen tv's, 2 dvd players, 2 separate air conditioners with remotes. The kitchen had everything you could ask for in terms of pots, pans, forks, spoons, glasses, toaster, crock pots, full oven, you name it. It was there with the one exception being steak knives. It's billed as a 2 bed 2 bath unit. Yes the 2nd bedroom is really part of main area with those extendable sliding walls but to be honest we had no problem with it. The eating area and lounging area are large enough in size to not feel cramped at all. The couch in the lounge area was also a pull out bed so you could put another 2 people there if needed. Our family of 4 didn't feel cramped at all with the space.The great thing with this condo is the size of porch/deck. It ran the complete length of the unit and had an entrance from both the master bedroom and the main area. The deck has another full table and 4 chairs, plus a set of lounge chairs, plus lots of space left over. It's really that big.The condo exceeded my expectations in every regard. It even had free LD to the mainland, and free wi-fi.The only thing I could fault it for was the bed in the master was lumpy. But that is it. I would highly recommend the unit to anyone.Regarding the hotel. Yes the outside is dated. Big deal, you don't spend hours looking at the outside of the building anyway. The inside has been renovated, the lobby, the grounds, the elevators have been updated.The bar/grill on the lobby floor offers good food at reasonable prices (not horrible waikiki prices). The general store is generally cheaper than the ABC Store just outside. There is a ""bathers elevator"" so you don't get on the elevator all wet. The people at the reception and cons. desk are super eager to help regardless of you staying at the condo or hotel. There is even a car rental right there.Yes there is a pool. It's small, and used mainly by the groups that live in the building. It's an older age group than my family so we didn't use it once. We are more beach and big water folk anyway. That said the people there looked like they were enjoying themselves. Yes they didn't like little kids being loud. But I knew that going in, so didn't even consider going there.Yes its easy access to the beach. Yes you can get a starbucks at the hilton next door. If you go through the reviews on this place, you will see most people really enjoyed the location. If you think its far to walk to the other side of Waikiki, just know we walked to the church at the other end of waikiki and it took 35 minutes door to door at a pace an eight year old can maintain. It was a 15 min walk to Ala Monana Mall. It was easy to get to.It's a great place and I would highly recommend the unit.

Beds are comfortable, big shower but small bathroom, dressing area with mirror, flat panel T.V.

The hotel does have a two restaurants and a mini mart, inside the lobby area, they will also provide beach towels for guests, very open airy atmosphere. It's right next to Hilton Village, which is nice to shop around in or there is a mall across the street in case you forgot something. The closest Starbucks is in the Hilton main entrance, watch out it can be pricey!

Spacious rooms, amazing view of ocean and marina from my 27th floor balcony. Short walk to the beach. It's at the far end of Waikiki (going away from Diamond Head), so it seems much less crowded and touristy. Clearly an older building, but maintained very nicely and has an open/modern feel. The pool is nothing special, but the adjacent tiki bar was the perfect place to wind down after a long work day. In-room internet speed was adequate, even though I was on a very high floor and feared it might be slower. My usual after-work routine was to grab a Mai Tai and watch the sunset torch lighting ceremony (complete with conch shell blowers, hulu dancers, etc). If you have a rental car, be sure to check out some of the less crowded and more scenic beaches on the North Shore. I especially liked swimming and snorkeling at Waimea Bay (and diving off the big rock), staying for the sunset, and then grabbing a less-expensive dinner at a local seafood restaurant on the way back to the Ilikai. For vacationers, I think you need at least 8 days in Hawaii to get the full ""experience"" but you might consider adding a 2nd island or. I was able to see just about everything on Oahu in my 4-5 ""free"" days off of work.

We thought it was Beach front because we didn't associate the pictures with the written descriptions, so in fact the property is Ocean Front with a 10 minute walk to the Beach. The condo itself is very clean, has most items you would want and is a 20 minute walk to food shops such as Foodland and/or Walmart, both of which are not cheap, but more reasonable than the ABC stores. The best place for fresh fruit and vegetables is Foodland as opposed to Walmart who have a smaller selection. The Hilton Village is next door where there are more shops. Every Friday night the Hilton puts on a huge fireworks display that can be seen from the balcony but is better seen down at the Hilton Lagoon. Every Tuesday thru Saturday the Hilton has a luau on the roof which can be heard and seen from the Balcony.The Ilikai is within walking distances of several very good restaurants and boasts two good ones itself. If you want to ""walk"" uptown to the International Market, all the designer stores etc, is a good 25-30 minute walk so pack good walking shoes. The Ala Moana Mall is a good 15 minute walk each way and is enormous and has every store you can imagine. Foodland grocery store is in there and if you give them your home phone number they take 10% off of your bill. The local bus service is very reliable and goes just about everywhere. Seniors ride for $1 and if you ask for a transfer you can ride within a 2 hour envelope for that same $1.00. Non seniors pay $2.50. I don't know what children pay.I booked two tours on line and realized good savings for doing it that way and for also booking 10 days in advance, so think about going that route. The condo has free calls to Canada and the USA and free WIFI The warm pacific ocean is wonderful and we found the best beach half way between De Roussy Park which is about 15 minutes from the condo.This condo does not half beach chairs and if you want to get them, they are 1/2 price at Walmart compared to the ABC stores, it's whether you want to carry them back all that way if you don't have a car.If you aren't used to city life and the hussle and bussle associated with a big city like Waikiki then don't come here.

First off: the view. You'd be very hard pressed to find a better view from a hotel room on the planet--serious. The ocean, the marina, the sunsets, the (daily) rainbows--all absolutely spectacular. We enjoyed watching the ships going in and out of Honolulu and Pearl Harbor. Can't say enough about the view.The hotel: our (condo) room was clean and very comfortable. The kitchen was adequate, the bathroom--same. Our king bed was extremely comfortable, the sleeper sofa in the living area comfortable only when we pulled the mattress off the frame and put it on the floor (but I think all sleeper sofa's are like that). The exterior wall of our room was all glass and most of it opens, which is very, very nice. The lanai was among the best I've ever experienced in a hotel anywhere in the world (read: huge with comfortable furniture). Don't recall ever having to wait on an elevator. We never made it to Sarento's (the top floor restaurant) but we did the Ilikai Bar and Grill (lobby level--outdoors) a few times and the food and service were good. The pizza and burgers don't disappoint and the BBQ Boneless Korean Kalbi was outstanding. The Tiki Torch lighting ritual is fun to watch and the live music was very good. Friday night fireworks are worth the watch. The Ilikai common spaces were clean and nice, and the folks at the hotel front desk were very friendly and helpful. One note I would make: the east side of the hotel is a bit close to the Hilton with some noise, plus the view, while still good is lacking in sunset and rainbows. The Ilikai is convenient to most everything in Waikiki. We walked or took the bus everywhere, including to Diamond Head and Pearl Harbor. The bus stops right in front of the hotel and is cheap and the routes are easy to figure out. If you're thinking about a car, it's good to now Honolulu streets are very crowded and parking fees are astronomical ~$30 overnight. There are car rental agencies right across the street. Waikiki Beach itself is just around the Hilton Lagoon (not even a five minute walk) and there is a nice path to follow--when you're on the beach, don't forget a shave ice! There are lots of places along the beach to wet your whistle, as well.A side note: if you have decent physical stamina, climb Diamond Head--it's worth every step. Also, pay your respects at Pearl Harbor.We thoroughly enjoyed Oahu/Honolulu/Waikiki and plan a return trip. We thoroughly enjoyed the Ilikai and will definitely stay here again.","Michigan, USA","paxMike</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Michigan, USA</strong>",40,5.0

It's in a relatively quieter location than many other hotels in central Waikiki: less than a 5-minute walk to the beach but about a 15-minute walk to the central Waikiki shopping area. There are plenty of restaurants within a short walk from the Ilikai, as is the Ala Moana beach park with green space and walking/biking trails. The Ilikai rooms are realtively inexpensive for the location and quality. My wife and I were given an ocean-view room on the 25th (second-to-top) floor even though we paid for an ""inland"" view room... we quickly found out that our room abutted the elevator shaft, so we got limited elevator noise (as it turns out, we didn't hear anything at night when the A/C was on). Our room was spotless, all appliances (TV, A/C) worked nicely, and the wifi was fast. The staff was very friendly and helpful.

I quite liked the Alana Moana Shopping Centre, and it's little village.The hotel itself had great things about it as such as having a lovely swimming pool, but it did not have a view of the beach which was a bit disappointing. The Hilton Hotel nearby had a pool close to the beach for people to swim at. Nothing wrong with the building, but some of the shops were disasterous, and had only very few restaurants to choose from. Make 5 restaurants, and I'll be happy. The apartment had fantastic views. The extra bed was VERY uncomfortable. Please make sure you accommodate good quality beds for your customers. You had only one bathroom and one ensuite, which is not enough. I don't like how you deal with the hotel financially, but don't usually get involved in that - however, i warn you to make it discounted to attract more customers.

These particular condos were rented through alohacondos.com. Because I booked a bit late, I ended up having to rent 2 condos for our 10 day stay (5 days in each location.)We were very pleased, first of all, with our overall experience at the Ilikai, and secondly with our particular condos. The decor in 1530 was what some would call dated (each privately owned condo has different decor and features) but as it turned out, it was actually much more comfortable than our second, more updated condo at 1512. There were 4 of us sharing the space, but plenty of storage and space to accomodate all of us. We were on the side facing the lagoon, and the view was fine. We did enjoy watching the luau at the Hilton while we ate our dinner on the lanai! Hey, pick up some to-go Hawaiian food at Ono Hawaiian Food, a mai-tai at the bar in the lobby, and you've got yourself the least expensive luau on the island!Both condos were well equipped with everything you would need in the kitchen, as well as beach chairs and accessories. 1530 had even more beach equipment, and would be an even better choice with families with kids. 1512 was much more updated, with many designer features, but not as much furniture, and a bit less comfy. We still enjoyed it, however.We appreciated that the lagoon and beach were a quick walking distance, without even having to cross the street. We actually prefer spending time at DeRussy beach, and that is very close as well; so is Ala Moana Beach Park.The staff of the hotel was always helpful, the lobby area very nice, the pool was small but served our needs. We really liked that it was at the ""end"" of the Waikiki strip; it meant that we didn't have to drive in and out through all the traffic on Kalakaua. And, we were able to rent our car for a few days right across the street, and take advantage of inexpensive parking at the Marina lot behind the hotel as well as at the nearby Hale Koa parking garage.We were very pleased with our choice of the Ilikai, and plan to stay there again. It may not be for everyone- if you need the newest and fanciest of hotels, this isn't it. Also, I would say to avoid rooms that face Ala Moana Blvd./ the mountains, as they would be much noisier.

We got a non- renovated condo on the 21st floor, lagoon view. The price through this company was cheaper than through the actual hotel. We were able to use all the facilities except for the gym. We did not get daily housekeeping though. The view was great and we were able to see the fireworks on Fridays and also got to have a look at the Laua at the Hilton from a distance. The room was large and likely needed some renos, but we paid the lower rate for a non renovated room. The family really enjoyed the trip. As other people have stated in previous reports, this hotel complex is on one end of the Waikiki beach strip. It is more quieter and less busy. That could be a good thing or bad thing depending on your preference. We liked it more quieter. It was very close to the Ala Moana Mall. The Hilton lagoon was nice place, the beach was a bit rocky, but closer to the dock had a smoother beach. It was nice to have a kitchnette to have breakfast and the occasional meal. Food is quite expensive in Honolulu. Close restaurants include McDonalds, Red Lobster, Outbacks. The Ala Moana Mall had an excellent food court and many restaurants. We rented a car for a couple of days to travel around the island. Found some cheaper parking behind the hotel near the Lagoon area/marina area. Six dollars for 10 hours and Twelve dollars for 24 hours, called LOT A. There is some free parking during the days only, no overnight parking around that area also. Helpful to have a GPS for the car though. We did some of the driving tours listing on the Honolulu tripadvisor forum. We used Hawaii 23 and Mark for the transportation to and from airport.

The location of the Ilikai is its greatest asset being away from the busy central part of Waikiki, close to good beaches, the Hilton lagoon and a 10 minute walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre. If staying on the Hilton resort side of the Ilikai you will get to watch the nightly luau which is quite novel. The first impression of the Ilikai when arriving is that it is old and in need of a makeover, however the inside has been renovated and is in good condition. The rooms are comfortable and far more spacious that what I had expected. The room I was in had large balconies to enjoy the views, excellent air conditioning, good kitchen facilities and comfortable beds. Free internet is also a key feature. Overall I was very impressed by the room.I did get frustrated with the elevators which seemed slow and ill equipped to handle the number of people staying in the hotel, although I was there in the busier new year period. The pool is small, old and seems to be populated by the retirees who permanently live in the complex.

This is our second stay at this hotel and the first thing we noticed was how many apartments are now private. Normally this wouldn't worry me but there was a definate ""clicky community"" by the pool. Most of the owners seem to be Americans in their 70's plus and they think they have the right to any sunbed etc which made things difficult as there were only 50 beds for a hotel that had 400 rooms. The staff at the small pool were also on first name terms with the apartment owners and went out of their way to make sure they got what they wanted. The room we stayed in was extremely spacious, it contained a fridge, a micorwave and a coffee maker plus a large flat screen tv and free internet service. The walk in shower was large but dated, the furniture was also dated although the bed was huge and very comfortable.

All in all watching the sunset off the balcony was one of the highlights every day.The reception staff were friendly and helpful as were the room staff and maintenance guys. Unfortunately the bar staff were mostly youngsters who were just there to pick up their wages and tips, without actually giving any decent sort of service. Entertainment was put on two nights a week during our stay which wasn't worth staying at the hotel to watch. Even New Years Eve when we finished watching the fireworks at midnight the bar was closed. One must is to eat at least once in Sarentos Italian restaurant on top of the hotel, only accessible by the outside glass lift. The view, service and food was excellent.The location of this hotel suited us down to the ground, it is next to the Hilton Hawaiian village and lagoon and a two minute walk to the beach.

Very happy with the Ilikai.We had a party of 7 and were originally expecting to enjoy two x 2 bedroom suites but unfortunately our travel agent messed up the bookings and we found out a couple of weeks before departure that we only had two hotel rooms. As you can imagine there is not much available in Waikiki at Xmas. None the less I contacted the hotel directly and a matter of days before we flew out a 2 bedroom suite opened up. The Ilikai reservation staff were very helpful and the check-in staff were terrific in sorting through the complicated booking arrangements.The room was fantastic with views directly out to the ocean on the 22nd floor. The hotel has been around for a while (featured in the original Hawaii 5-0 series I believe) and is at one end of the Waikiki strip but don't let that deter you. It is well maintained and clean, our rooms had great views. It's not exactly on the beach but it is barely 100 metres from the Hilton Lagoon and Waikiki beach, a short walk to Ala Moana mall one way and all the key activities in Waikiki the other. We had a perfect view of the fireworks from one balcony and could watch the Hilton's Luau from the other.Would definitely stay at the Ilikai again.","Canberra, Australia","BKDA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",12,4.0

The Ilikai is a very clean and tidy hotel from the entry to the rooms. We were in room 2442 which overlooked the Hilton lagoon and out to the ocean. The room was very spacious, big bathroom, 2 showers, seperate toilet, microwave and empty fridge. The lanai was also large. There is enough room for two queen side beds which would be better than two double beds. There is a laundry on every floor at a reasonable cost. The restaurants are reasonably priced with nice food. The Ilikai is central with a 10-15 minute walk into central Honolulu and a 5-10 minute walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre. If on the lagoon side you can see the Hilton's fireworks every Friday night. The staff are more than accommodating with any requests and were immediate in response. The best rooms for a view are obviously the Hilton side or over the marina. Very reasonably priced for Christmas/New Year period. The four stars is because I agree the pool area and gym are small, if this is the vacation you want, but you can spend time at the Hilton Lagoon or on the beach.

We found the unit to be nice, but some improvements would make the experience even better.The property is located on a main street, at the West end of Waikiki Beach, next to Hilton Hawaiian Village. It is a very short walk to the beach/harbor from the property. Nearby restaurants, which you can walk to in less than 5 minutes, include; McDonalds, Subway, IHOP, Outback, Buffalo Wild Wings, Red Lobster, and more ABC Stores than you can count. If you have never been in an ABC store, it’s kind of like packing a Walmart into a 7-11 store.The property will remind you of the 70's and Hawaii Five-0, but is very well maintained. The grounds are very lush and tropical. They have a commercial business center only, which is only open until 5:00pm. If you need to use a computer/printer, the cost is $15 per hour. There is a nice large fully stocked market on the property. There is a Bar & Grill that serves good food at a reasonable cost, and has a view of the harbor and ocean. There is also a fine Italian restaurant on the roof top. The pool is in need of a make over. It’s on the smaller side, not heated, and has no view because of a tall brick wall surrounding it. There is no jacuzzi/spa. There is also a 24 hour laundry room, I believe on each floor. A wash and dry is $5 per load, and soap is $1.25 per load. There is also a medium size gym with the basic machines/weights. The only onsite parking is valet, which I believe is $12 - 15 per day with in/out privileges. All interaction with the hotel staff were excellent. They were all very friendly, professional, and helpful.The Ilikai is a mix of hotel and privately owned condos. We stayed in condo #1710, which is a corner unit with fantastic ocean views and views of the harbor out of the main patio. The side patio has great city views. The sunsets are absolutely wonderful. The condo had 2 rooms/2 bathrooms. One room had a queen bed, the other room had two twin beds which could be moved together to make a king bed (the twin beds were uncomfortable). There are televisions in the living room, with basic cable and a VHS and DVD player, and one in the queen bedroom. The second room did not have a television. The unit was nicely decorated and clean.Some of the negatives about the unit. You need pool passes to use the pool, but you have to go down to the management office to pick up the passes. The office is closed after 5:00pm, and on the weekends. There was an internet router in the condo, but no instructions or password given, so we could not use the internet with our wireless devices during our stay. The “stocked kitchen” was inadequate for the needs of a family. They were short on glasses, and the cookware was missing needed items. The one cooking pan was an old teflon pan, that was all scratched on the cooking surface, not the healthiest thing to cook in. Some of the utensils and cookware were not properly cleaned.If you are staying at the Ilikai on a Friday evening, make sure to take a short walk to the beach side of the next door Hilton Hawaiian Village for the fireworks show at around 7:30pm. The kids loved it. There are many restaurants, shops, and services located at the Hilton, including a US Post Office.Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Ilikai and Condo #1710. I would recommend this location/unit to my family and friends based on the price at the time they are staying. I would stay again if traveling with the family and needed 2 rooms.","Los Angeles, California","SNAFU23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",347,4.0

Although we were well enough satisfied with the accommodation, the walk into the central Waikiki beach area (where the best waves were) and to restaurants grew very tedious -- it's a good 25-30 minute walk. The beach near the hotel doesn't offer very good swimming and the pool, as other reviewers have pointed out, is small and not particularly nice. On the other hand, the hotel offers easy access to the Ala Moana shopping centre, it is quiet at night, and it's close to the Hilton lagoon if you have young children. The accommodation at the hotel is good and spacious (if you want a studio or apartment) but housekeeping was quite slow making up the rooms.

Choosing a hotel in Waikiki was quite a challenge given the vast array of options, but in the end we were swayed by the fact that this hotel was at the more ""quiet"" end of the city, no loud nightclubs and party goers to contend with. We loved our stay here. Our room was very large and had a balcony that looked out over the marina as well as a kitchen, big TV and lounge. The pool here is quite small, but more than functional. The hotel is located next door to the Hilton Hotel so we often walked over there (a 5 minute stroll) and swam in the Hilton Lagoon (which is a public swimming spot) or the beach right next to it. The beach is a bit rocky getting into the water, but I think all of Waikiki is like that. The water was lovely.Our room had a kitchen so we ate breakfast in our room each day (there's a supermarket not too far away or ABC stores everywhere) but ate dinner in their restaurant one night (Sarento's) which has a fantastic view over the city and the food & service were outstanding. There are a plethora of places to eat nearby and the Ala Moana shopping centre is about a 15 minute walk or 5 minute bus ride up the road.Would we stay here again? In a heartbeat.

The lagoon is good for kids to play safely but what looks like nice sand is really hard and crusty...you won't be building any sand castles. The actual beach past the lagoon is rocky and murky.

We used Speedi Shuttles for our transfers to/from the Airport both on Waikiki and Maui - they were reliable, courteous and very helpful. HOTEL AMENITIESThere are plenty of lifts within the building, an escalator at the front door as well as stairs, concierge will look after your luggage for a small fee $4 if you arrive earlier than your check-in time. The lanai's are a decent size to sit on and view the marina, beach and fabulous sunsets. There's a coffee shop in the hotel foyer plus a convenience store which is open until late. There are laundry facilities on every floor with both washing machines and dryers (both of which use quarters i.e. 25 cents - wash and dry cost $2.50 each). You can either use the vending machine within the laundry to purchase washing detergent or the convenience store downtairs stocks it too. If you need change, there's a machine located near the reception desk that changes notes into quarters.Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this property and having an apartment with a decent size lanai (balcony), huge fridge and cooking facilities was a real plus.",Australia,"jaxnova</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",48,5.0

Was good that the sun didn't come in to far in afternoon so could sit there (unlike some of the other water facing Condo's, with glass of wine in hand in champagne glass! overlooking the marina and ocean it was simply beautiful, more so as sun went down and lights came on. Considering size of building we never had to wait for lifts very long, Location was great, found it was so close to restaurants, bars, take ways, ABC store, plus buses and easy to get a cab, short walk to the massive Ala Moana Shopping centre too.Firstly if you stay here read instructions properly (we didn't) any problems call the cleaner!, and phone prefix in brackets are not used locally.couple of of problems encountered... No compendium in room, where to go what to see, local bus routes etc.No instructions for TV or its chanels.Coffee perk was dirty, only 2 small champagne glasses and one wine glass to drink (wine) from provided, a whole two dinner plates to choose from, so its wash up as you go, lots of cutlery though!, found out on our return should have called cleaning contractor if we had read instructions properly, silly us. Carpet was also dirty (didn't look like it) made our bare feet black, purchased some slip-ons at Wallmart (could've called that cleaner!). Pin was stuck in carpet, stood up by bed and on it, made under toe bleed slightly was bit sore for few days, but got better by end of week (could've called the cleaner for ointment & band aid! - we guess). Advised maintenance was to be done while we were still occupying condo!, what!, why then not in between rentals?, it was not urgent, all that happened was two guys came replaced the old salmon coloured covers on the 2 low uncomfortable patio (lanai) chairs, with off white ones of same vintage and condition! (no cleaner required!). Toilet had plunger sitting beside it!, why…was that a message?, toilet blocked up twice had to get plumber in, they left a mess, we cleaned up floor (yep could have called cleaner yet again but last one was 9pm anyway). King bed had seen its best days, lump in middle, fell into sides & very soft, pillows far to soft too, really awful (the cleaner!). Paid cleaning fee but still had leave Condo as we found it! on departure.

Not sure that I can really think of anything to complain about (I can still be objective even though it was mostly free)! We were quickly helped upon arrival by a courteous and friendly staff member at the front desk. Our room was spacious, as well as our private balcony. We had a room with a king bed, living area, and full kitchen (all in one big room). Full refrigerator, stove, etc. This was very convenient and we were able to save money by making use of restaurant leftovers. There was a decent sized safe inside the closet, a nice large flat screen tv hung on the wall, and a remote control for the a/c. Our room faced the marina and ocean and we watched the sunset from our balcony each day. The hotel is conveniently located within walking distance to Ala Moana shopping center and most of Waikiki shopping and restaurants. It is also far enough down at the end of the beach (opposite end from Diamond Head) to not be in the middle of noise and traffic. This was a great balance for us. It could be a bit of a walk to the other end of the beach, but given the beautiful weather and nice surroundings, we enjoyed the stroll numerous times. You can always catch the easily navigable bus system right out in front of the hotel if you are unable to make the walk. We did not rent a car, did most of our sight seeing on foot, and many activities will pick you up right out in front of the hotel (ex: our luau, and ghost tour). Getting to the beach was an easy and picturesque walk around the adjacent lagoon. There is a bar and grill on the bottom floor and a nicer restaurant on the top floor. Many easily walkable restaurants in the neighboring Hilton Hawaiian Village as well as nearby fast food and chains out the front of the hotel across the street.We were given two beach towel cards which we did not use (we brought our own), but I am sure this would be helpful to have if you did not bring any. There was a shop downstairs that had food, snacks, fountain drinks, basic drugstore items, clothes, souvenirs, magazines, etc. This was very handy. We did not make use of the gym, pool, or other clothing shop. On Friday night, there was live music and hula dancers out back and fireworks. I believe these are regular activities. Every single person we encountered at the Ilikai was professional, kind, friendly and helpful, even as we were there as the APEC events were unfolding. Leaving came with some difficulties as city officials had shut down Ala Moana in front of the hotel due to traveling dignitaries for APEC. Front desk staff got on the phone to call SpeediShuttle for us to be sure we knew how to find them (I did not feel this was their responsibility and we appreciated them helping in every way they could). We had to meet SpeediShuttle across the street due to the closure and even the bellman was very concerned about helping us and offered to find a way to help us get our luggage across the street. At this point, we had checked out and were no longer customers at the hotel, yet they continued to help us every way possible. We really have nothing bad to say about our stay at the Ilikai. We paid for an extra night, the room rate was reasonable, our room and common areas were kept clean, the hotel staff maintained their friendly disposition even during the high stress of APEC. We would absolutely stay here again and have many fond memories of the Ilikai. In response to a few negative comments by other reviewers, I would definitely say there is another side to the coin..... We love the smoking laws there and being able to enjoy our balcony without smelling someone else's smoke. Another reviewer complained that their boys were not allowed to be rambunctious in the pool area... well, as travelers who were visiting without kids, we appreciate that they do not allow rowdy, disruptive (not to mention unsafe) activity to take place.

Could not beat it. Our room faced the backside, overlooking the city and the mountains. Really a lovely view especially in the morning with the clouds coming just over the tips of the mountains, and the lights coming on in the various buildings. I wouldn't pay for ocean view since we would have rarely been there to enjoy it. The whole place seems a tad dated, as others have noted, but in some ways that is part of the charm. Our room was HUGE, with a very comfy bed and nice linens, simple but serviceable furniture. Also a huge bathroom with a tub and a separate shower. The tile was old, had a lot of grount stains and probably would benefit from a bathroom fan to keep the mold down. My understanding is that this is also a condominium, so there were always lots of people coming and going and the elevators were slow and always crowded. Pretty lobby area with lots of space to roam. I think they are putting in a small market so you can get coffee and light food to go...would be a welcome addition.We ate one evening at the outdoor cafe. Nice view of the marina. Food was good although the chicken salad I ordered was missing the chicken! Great pina colada. We had no problem with valet services. Yes, it's expensive but that is the price of staying in Waikiki. We never had to wait more than a few minutes for the car. Front desk service was friendly although there were times when I would stand there three to four minutes and no one ever came out. Also a glitch at checkout regarding the special we had booked. Thankfully I had my original booking sheet that confirmed the price so they did honor it. The absolute best thing about the Ilikai is the value, which is why I rated it very good. If you want service and luxury, look elsewhere, and expect to spend a lot for it. This place is clean, comfy, with a bit of nostalgic edge, all at a very fair price.","Belleair, Florida","louisek431</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Belleair, Florida</strong>",156,4.0

I chose this hotel because of (1) the consistent ratings on Trip Advisor - and has recently received an even higher rating - and (2) the connection with the original Hawaii Five-O series (I am a Jack Lord/Steve McGarrett fan). We paid $135/ night for an ocean view room at AAA rates - amazing. The room was spacious, simple, with a ""beachy"" decor; the bed was very comfortable; the lanai was small but the view was quite good from the 22nd floor (Hilton Hawaiian Village hotel, but also the lagoon, ocean and Ilikai pool); we even enjoyed the Hilton fireworks from the lanai. The room was very clean and this was the best housekeeping we had during our holiday. The front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful, as was the staff in the restaurant. The hotel lobby and restaurant area were light, airy, and welcoming. The beach is next door, and you walk alongside a parking lot, entering at the end of the Hilton lagoon area. This end of Waikiki is relatively quiet, compared to Kuhio beach / Kalakaua Ave section.

Now, I was staying there for our Marine Corps Ball and alot of people knew I was staying there- so people can just park and tell them my name and I am responsible for them??? The lady told me that the extra car was still there and told me to sit down and wait for the valet supervisor. I waited 20 minutes with nobody showing up, and I had to leave (I have a life) so I walked out to the valet to get my car and was just gonna take the $25.00 as a loss. The valet stand helped a man before me and she then couldn't find his keys! She didn't even acknowledge that I was waiting, but I stood there waiting for another 15 minutes while she attempted to find this gentlemen's keys.

The hotel is also located within walking distance of the beach and the international market area as well as quite a few really nice restaurants in all price ranges.

The staff was extremely nice and made the stay more enjoyable. I had a rental car while I was there as well and the valet's were always courteous, helpful and quick no matter when I arrived or departed. You can drive to just about anything you are interested in very quickly from this location and it is easy to get in and out except during rush hour when the H-1 turns into a virtual parking lot.","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","John H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</strong>",19,5.0

The rooms are twice the size of most hotels, two very large closets, sitting area, dining area, microwave, fridge, coffee maker, a king bed that was very comfortable, balcony with table and chairs and the bathroom was to die for!! The first half had a large vanity, tub with hand held shower, the second half had a shower and toilet (each half was the size of most upgraded hotel baths). The lobby and connecting walkways were spectacular with granite and teak flooring, beautiful flora and fawna, a bar and grill that was wonderful and enough food on 1 plate for 2 people they are so large and wonderful. The pool is beautiful and you are on the Waikiki beach. Most importantly, the staff went out of their way to accomodate any request and they did it with a smile. I was also able to attend church right in the hotel - an interdenominational service with beautiful music and good minister.

They are right next to each other, and I will be posting a review for the HHV as well. The Ilikai is definitely more reasonably priced, but the property is somewhat outdated for sure. That's not to say that it isn't clean or well-maintained, which it is both; but it does give off somewhat of a 70's vibe as it is an older property. The rooms were very spacious (even a regular room with two single beds which a couple of my friends were in). Everyone working there was very pleasant, and there were no problems with the service either.The location is fantastic, right on the western edge of Waikiki. The beach is a short walk away, as are a lot of great restaurants (Nobu, Morimoto, Roy's) and shopping (Ala Moana Mall). I don't have any complaints about this hotel and would recommend it to anyone visiting Waikiki.

No bad surprises. Staff is friendly and helpful. We stayed for eight days in this excellent location close to Waikiki Beach. It's away from the busiest part of the Waikiki and you can walk there in ten minutes or less. The hotel is right next to the Hilton Complex which has a lagoon and nice beach.There is a firework show every Friday at the Hilton and the best spot to view is at the raised promenade walkway, we had seats watching the performance outside the hotel restaurant before the fireworks starts. If you are planning to rent a vehicle to tour around the island, which is an excellent idea, you can park your rental car at the marina just behind the hotel which you can park there for $12 for 10 hours during weekdays and $24 for 10 hours on weekends. I would highly recommend Pearl Harbor for at least half day as there are many attractions there. You can miss the west side of the island as there is not much to see there and the crime rate is higher there also. Be sure to check out Hanauma Bay (http://www.hanauma-bay-hawaii.com/) even if you are not snorkelling, the scenery is out of this world but make sure you get there early as the parking lot fills up really fast and there is no parking on the highway. After the short hike from the beach to the parking lot, you should grab some shaved ice at the concession stand, perfect on a hot day!

We have stayed at both of the mentioned properties and although they have beautiful grounds, the crowds and price don't come close to the serenity and slow pace of the Ilikai! We were in a condo facing the lagoon and ocean and loved the view each morning and evening. The pool was never crowded and the pool loungers were very comfortable. Didn't eat at the hotel restaurant (never saw more than four people) eating there. We rented a car from budget across the street for one day and it was great to drop the car off and walk across the street back to the Ilikai: LOTS OF EASE staying here...a few blocks from Ala Moana shopping center if you need, close the bus lines (which we used daily and very efficient #8), and a short walk to many good restaurants (Roy's, Charthouse, Eggs & Things etc.) The staff was very friendly and helpful (except one). We commented several times on how quiet the hallways were and how easy it was to stay here. Every evening we walked from the Hawaiian Village next the beach to Ft. Derussy and back at sunset.

Had an ocean view room on the 23rd floor (room 2318). Had a good view of the ocean and Hilton Hawaiian Village lagoon directly out from front of balcony (provides a good amount of ocean view, but is cut off by the Ilikai building to the right and the Hilton Hawaiian Village lagoon tower to the left. Can see more ocean view when looking to the left while standing on the balcony (can see part of Diamond Head behind other Hilton Hawaiian Village towers). Room had two queen beds, flat screen TV mounted on wall, chair, desk, drawers. The room was surprisingly large, much larger than I needed. Has a large closet with free room safe (iron, ironing board, and hairdryer located in the closet). Bathroom had separate shower and bathtub. Usual bath toiletries (Aqua Hotel brand) that were replenished every day, and also had coffee maker and coffee/creamer/sugar.Room was clean, a little worn, but completely acceptable. Grout in bathroom could probably be redone, but I found the room to be excellent value for the price paid (I found $128 per night on Blue Hawaii Resorts web page, which was at least $35 per night cheaper than all the regular web travel sites). Travelled with a friend who has a fear of heights (we didn't realize that the hotel rooms are all on the upper floors) so they upgraded her for free to a room on the third floor that had a kitchen. My room wasn't ready at 1pm when we arrived, but my friend's room was available and allowed to check-in early. Room was cleaned every day with no complaints. Free stack of local newspaper everyday located on the table near the elevators.We found the only reasonable option for parking was using the hotel valet. There is other parking lots nearby but not for overnight parking. Valet was $25.oo per day, free in and out. The valet folks were extremely efficient and polite. I didn't eat at the hotel, but my friend had breakfast one day and said it was terrible (cold French toast). Did have bar drinks which were reasonable and good.The hotel is located behind the Hilton Hawaiian Hotel on Ala Moana Boulevard, which is a less crowded area at the end of Waikiki near to Honolulu. I enjoyed not being in the craziness of the middle of Waikiki, yet it was only a 5 minute drive (or 15-20 minute walk). Would definitely stay here again when visiting Waikiki. Make sure you get a map if not familiar with Waikiki, a lot of one-way streets make things a little confusing. Additionally, roadworks were going on infront of the hotel (Ala Moana Blvd) at night which made getting back to the hotel a little slow.Things we did while visiting.1. The USS Arizona Memorial - very nicely done tour, arrived at 7:15 am and got into the 8am short movie and boat to the memorial after - gave the rest of the day to do other things.2. Saw a free concert by the Royal Hawaiian Band on the grounds of the Iolani Palace at noon on Friday (think they have concerts every week at that time). Was very enjoyable, the crowd was older.3. Favorite beach - Waimanolo, was almost deserted with beautiful turquoise water (mid week).4. At at Dukes, the Hula Grill, and Tiki Terrace all in Waikiki and all were good.5. The Dole Plantation on the way to the North Shore - the pineapple ice-cream is delicious, but the hard sell from a lot of the employees in the store was off putting.","Palo Alto, California","KarenAnneM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palo Alto, California</strong>",60,4.0

Anyway we needn't have worried as the staff on the desk (and they were all great) upgraded us to an Ocean View room overlooking the marina and beach - really beautiful. The room itself was massive with plenty of draw and closet space. My wife and I found the location just fine, a bit of a walk into Waikiki proper but no big deal and my wife has dodgy knees. The Ala Mona shopping center was only 10 minutes walk as well. The grill at the hotel was fabulous - really nice meals and very friendly, helpful staff. The coffee shop in the hotel did the best coffee I've had anywhere in the US. My only gripes was the there wasn't adequate shade at the pool although this didn't seem to bother the Americans? And also I couldn't connect my Ipad through the hotel WI-FI Network although they did have free Wi-Fi at the excellent coffee shop so again no biggie. That was our 1st visit to Hawaii but it wont be the last. It a lovely place with lovely people.

As no one was in the condo the night before we were able to come in early which was great for us as we were there about 9am. It t was great to just go straight up to the room without having to check in. Loved having a pin code instead of a key or swipe card.....made it a lot easier when going to the beach......no keys to worry about. The condo was exactly as described and was perfect for us. It was very roomy and the view was spectacular ! The beds were really comfortable although the pillows were pathetic, but as we had 2 double beds there were lots of pillows to choose from. The hotel is lovely, the lobby and the outside areas are extremely well maintained. There was always someone cleaning there.............and the outside gardens and water features were beautiful. We ate in the Bar & Grill once for dinner and twice for lunch and the food was always delicious and the staff super friendly. We didn't use the pool as the beach was just a couple of minutes walk down the walkway. The pool was closed until 8.30am each morning as it was used for laps & rehab and then it was closed at 7.30pm. We found this annoying as there were some nights we would have liked to have a quick swim when we got back after a long hot day out.We found it nice to swim just in front of the Tropics restaurant at the Hilton - less rocky there - the water was so nice.As someone mentioned in an earlier review about the lifts,while we were there at one stage it was down to 2 out of 5 lifts working. Fortunately we were on an upper floor as those on lower floors would have had to wait for ages to get on a lift as they were usually full by the time it got to the 15th floor. About half way through our stay the lifts were fixed and 4 out of 5 were working and we had no dramas from then on. There was a lift to use if you had sand or were wet but the few times we went to use this it was also out of order. We liked being at the quieter end of Waikiki although some nights when were were really tired and had been down to Waikiki for dinner we wished were staying closer instead of having to get the bus back (too tired to walk). The proximity to Ala Moana was fantastic and there were 2 ABC stores really close as well as lots of restaurants.

No room service but frig and coffee maker in room and plenty of places to shop for food and dining out nearby. Loved the Top of the I - excellent Tapas menu - they have Happy Hour as well. If you want to go to the beach you absolutely MUST wear water shoes as beach is rocky and in barefeet a potential nightmare. Once in the ocean, great swimming and snorkeling. The Bar and Grill is up to par for eating but slow for breakfast. We were on the 25th floor with ""ocean view"" which it sortof was. Great view anyway but if you have suicidal tendencies stay away from the balcony. If I had children I would not choose this hotel unless I was on the ground - or close to - floor.

The location of the Ilikai is great if you want to get out of the hustle and bustle on Waikiki. The trolley bus stopped directly outside the hotel and was only 10 mins to the centre of Waikiki. the room had great views of the Hilton Luau everynight and of the fireworks on a friday nights. the only problem i encountered was the front desk would not cash an Amex travellers cheque as we were in a private rental even though we were spending money at the retaurants and bars.That is the first time in 3 trips to the US that i have been unable to cash a TC, even corner shops accept them. Our tour guide said management had recently changed so maybe they hav'nt got their act quite together. the pool is small but never crowded although the pool attendant was sometimes over zealous with the pool rules, not sure if its the pool for children as i don't think the pool attendant likes too much noise. the Hilton lagoon is probably a better option with kids. the bar/restaurant was nice and the food was good. As we were in a private rental there was no room service but we were able to buy meals at the restaurant and bring them back. there is a supermarket a couple of blocks away but it was quite expensive. There is also an ABC store across the road as well that sold the basics (food).there is also a supermarket at Ala Moana shops althought we didn't get to it but i would imagine it would be cheaper that the smallersupermarket nearer to the ilikai. There was a laundry on our floor and i think from memory was $4.50 to do a wash and then more for the dryer.There were only a few shops in the lobby and a lot of empty storefronts but they were in the process of opening a ""market"". i would say it is open by now.

Other than that, this hotel was about average, like a Best Western or Motel 8. My husband and I were on our honeymoon when we stayed at this hotel. We booked our hotel room at the Ilikai through our credit card company because we had points we could use towards our room. We stayed here for three nights in the middle of September on the 23rd floor facing the mountains. I notified the hotel before our trip that this was our honeymoon and we would like a king size bed. When we arrived, we were told that we would be receiving 2 double beds. To us, that really was not acceptable for a honeymoon stay, but we really did not have a choice in the matter. The hotel never gave us the option to upgrade to another, maybe more expensive room. To the hotel's credit, the front desk staff did give the appearance that they were working hard on finding us another room with a king size bed, but we never did receive another room with a king bed during our 3.5 day stay.The hotel is situated at the end or beginning (depending on how you look at it) of the Waikiki hotel strip. For this reason, it is super quiet, which was a nice welcome to Honolulu. The hotel itself is, and I stress, dated! We are by no means Ritz Carleton type people, but come on, it's seriously time for a major renovation. Because the hotel rooms are dated, it gives the appearance that the rooms are not clean i.e. torn carpets, small holes in the walls, dirty grout in the bathroom. It really didn't bother us, but I can see how some people would be offended at a room of this magnitude. Our room was fine for maybe a 2 or 3 star standard hotel room. It was clean, and we did not have any problems during our stay. It included a flat screen tv, refrigerator, microwave, shower and bathtub, and it was quite large. We had plenty of room to spread out.We ate at the pool restaurant, which was average and very expensive for what it is. I made the mistake of purchasing water and a couple of bags of chips at the store in the hotel on the first night we were there....talk about price gauging. $10 for a gallon of water and two small bags of chips. I know Hawaii in general is expensive, but come on! I wish I would have known that there was an ABC store right next to the hotel so I didn't get ripped off.The hotel pool is small and nice enough for a quick dip. Who really needs a pool when the ocean is almost at your door step? By no means is this hotel directly on the beach, but it is within a quick 10 minute walk down a walkway and around the Hilton Lagoon to the beach. The hotel also offers beach and pool towels to use, but whatever you do, do not lose your towel cards because they will charge you $25 a pop if they are lost.We ate at a local coffee shop for breakfast almost every day we were there, and at the sports bar across the street. I would not recommend renting a car unless you plan to travel to more distant parts of Oahu, like the North Shore. It's really not worth it, and the bus system seems to be pretty reliable.

Loved the little coffee shop in the hotel, great cappucinos, and great to find a coffee shop that serves different types of coffees not some black stuff thats been sitting brewing in a pot all day. The bar/restaurant in the hotel lobby was a great find and so convenient for any meals, particularly early morning breakfasts before heading off on tours. The hotel is in a good location to shops, the main beaches and having the trolley bus stop in front was very handy. The reruns of Hawaii Five-0 in the lobby were a brilliant touch.

We have been going to HI for many years and have many friends that live in Honolulu. The Ilikai is a fixture in Waikiki, but has still maintained its Aloha in the face of an overflow of tourists. We paid a little extra for an ocean view with sunset; it was worth every penny. Large rooms (compared to the Royal Hawaiian and Surfrider) at a fraction of the cost make this a great bargain. For us (we are in our 60s) we could easily walk to some of the best restaurants in Waikiki (Roys, House without a Key, etc.) and the nearby beaches. Our favorite was a walk to Ala Moana Shopping center to pick up a bento from Shirokiya and head over to the Ala Moana Park for a picnic and swimming.","San Francisco, California","travelmaxwk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",6,4.0

Rooms are large with a large bathroom with separate toilet area with its own shower. Beds are comfortable and 4 people did not feel crowded. The hotel is very clean and staff go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant one. Part of the hotel is time share, but no one bothered us there. One person mentioned it to our friend and then let it drop..no pushiness. The highest floors are the hotel rooms and that was great! There is a magnificent restaurant on the highest floor. The roof is the place where the opening scene of the original Hawaii Five-0 was filmed. We were on the opposite side from the sunset but the sunrise over Diamond Head is lovely as well. We actually were able to watch a luau on the roof of the building next door and to hear the music from it..not too loud..just pleasant. Sat on balcony and watched the surfers morning and evening. Great little coffee shop downstairs with very friendly staff! Convenience store in lobby as well. Loved the balcony to our room.Free internet was a bonus!! Valet parking was quick and convenient with in and out privileges.-I would not hesitate to recommend this property to friends and clients.For those on a bit of a food budget...McDonalds and IHop and The Ala Moana great Shopping Mall with a food court (try the Japanese...it is fantastic!) are a very short walk away. 2 ABC stores within a block (anyone who has been to Hawaii knows about these convenience stores.)Transportation to the main Waikiki beach is frequent and not expensive but walking is very easy.We will definitely return to the Ilikai at our first opportunity!Thank you to the front desk staff who were so friendly and helpful at all times.",Canada,"children6</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",17,5.0

It is in a good location at the end of the sandy beach, great for people who like to walk. The building has great views and is very well built, you cannot hear your neighbors, unless they are being noisy out on their balconies. Our condo was next to the elevators,(#1528) but only rarely could we hear a faint ding of the elevator reaching our floor. Although this condo had not been updated (except for new carpet) it was very clean, no bugs, cool old retro stove in an aqua color, but otherwise new appliances, fully stocked kitchen, linens, beach towels,soaps, cleaners, we did not want for anything! Bed was firm but comfy, tons of pillows to choose from, great water pressure in the shower, just great for 2 people who dont spend all day indoors. We could walk to foodland at the ala moana shopping center for groceries(or you could take one of the many buses). The balcony was nice to sit on in the afternoon, but it was not quiet like a beachfront condo in maui, you could not hear the waves laping at the shore, mostly air conditioners, generators from the hilton hawaiian village, but that is what you get in Waikiki, there are no condos that close to the waves. Sure you could pay much more at an expensive hotel and get closer to the waves, but for $110 a night you cannot beat the Ilikai. ( We did consider renting a condo at the waikiki shore, but are glad we choose not to, as there is not much of a beach in front of that skinny little building, and the lanais either face another building or a pathway to the beach. That area was just too busy for us) We walked there many times for dinner and were glad to walk back to our quiet area at the Ilikai.We saw the fabulous firework show from our lanai on Friday night, and walked thru the Hilton Hawaiian village, on our way out every night, the Tropics bar/restaurant there had great bands at happy hour and sunset, also the best mai tai's. We like to walk, so the walk to the beach was 5 to 10 mins depending on what piece of the beach appealed to us, we looked for the sandiest entrance to the water, cause there is rocks and coral just in front of the logoon side of the hilton (bring water shoes, cause that is a nice beach otherwise, water was very warm there) If you sit in front of the Hale Loa hotel the beach is fine for bare feet. We walked to Diamond head and hiked up the hill one morning, it took about an hour to get there and another 50 mins to get up and down, but after 8:30 Am that climb gets really busy, with people who are not used to hiking or doing hundreds of stairs so it could take much longer to get up and down later in the day. (there is no passing people on the stairs, too narrow)Best restaurants, Roys, Lulu's, Hula grill for dinner, Dukes & Tropics for happy hour. Don't bother with the shorebird, buffets are overpriced for what you get and cooking your own meat at dinner is a novelty, the steak was not good quality, and you could get one done for you at the same price else where.","Kelowna, Canada","carcar47</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kelowna, Canada</strong>",66,4.0

Hotel and condo properties are exteremely well maintained. Our condo had a fabulous view, very nice accomodations, comfortable furniture and beds, and the unit was fully equiped. Even had beach chairs and mats etc for our use. The only problem we encountered was slow elevators. At any given time only 3 of the 6 elevators were working and the place is VERY busy - lots of people coming and going - so during the morning hours or early evening hours you could wait for 15 to 20 minutes before there would be room for us in one of the elevators. Sometimes it was better to catch one going up - just to go down.The Ilikai is located at the top end of Waikiki Beach and it makes it close to many restuarants small shops (like the ABC Stores) and the Ala Moana shoping Center. It is also right on the main bus lines and tour bus stops. This made it extremely easy to get anywhere we wanted to go.

We made reservations to stay for 7 days, but left after two as my family and I felt as though we were staying in a prison. When I notified the owner that we made arrangements to move to a place where we could actually have some fun (this was a vacation after all), the owner apologized for the terrible experience. I did ask the owner if she would consider refunding the money (I do acknowledge the reservation was non-refundable) for the time we did not stay, and her response was I am sorry, I can not refund your money, I can not rent the place out now...

I later discovered there was also a hotel at this location, and the price to stay on the beach in Waikiki was fantastic. I was so happy I stayed here.My original budget allowed me to stay here (treat myself to room with ocean view) and the sapend the second half of my vacation at a less expensive hotel a couple blocks away from the ocean. NOTE: this was bad judgemnet on my part; I should have stayed at the Ilikai the whole time!The hotel itself looked dated from the outside. The lobby was open and airy. I was pleasantly surprsied at my room... It was one of the largest rooms I've stayed in at a hotel. The furnishings were new, and the room was clean. There was a tiny bar fridge. My room had an awesome view (ocean, Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Lagoon). I often visited the Hilton Hawaiian Village next door (which is awesome and goes on forever). The price for this hotel was very competitive.As a solo traveller, I felt safe at this hotel, but not safe walking on the street out front of this hotel at night. I still did go ut alone though, and had no problems.The location was perfect for me... There's a hugh resort next door, awesome views of the lagoon and marina, it's the start of Waikiki beach (so it's not incredibly crowded here), you can catch the city buses out front that take you over the whole island, there was a McDonalds and popular chicken wing place across the road (as well as car rental).The clientele seemed to mostly seniors (and re-occurring) guests here. I'm in my 30s, but was ok with that. I had no troubles.The restaurant up top has fantastic views and amazing prices for an italian meal if you can get there during happy hour.Also, there was a laundry facilty and pop machine on my floor for reasonable prices.This building is a combo of a hotel, time share and condo.","Welland, Canada","JulesReviews</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Welland, Canada</strong>",85,4.0

The hotel is at the edge of Waikiki Beach but yet very close to shopping, restaurants and many touris attractions. We did not rent a car as the bus system in Waikiki is so good. There are also trolleys that you can catch that will take you to so many places. Make sure that you visit Hilo Hatties factor store. Lots of really good quality clothing and the prices are very reasonable. We spend one entire day at the Polynesian Cultural Centre.

I did some involved research before going and everything was pretty bang on. The condo itself was quite lovely inside after being renovated the last year or so. The stainless steel kitchen and granite tops were quite ample and I did cook quite a lot of our meals there with no problem. It was nice to cook with the ocean view. The smoke alarm would go off but there is a button on there to 'push to hush'! The bathroom was fine except that we had a unit (2124) that had a japanese soaking tub...not the easiest thing to get in and out of and it didn't really drain that well. The beds were comfortable but just a double size. The living area a hit with my 11 year old boy who liked to have his time there while we sat on the lanai most of the time. At first I was scared of the high height but I knew this at the time of booking and I just wanted to have the views. That I was not disappointed on as the views were amazing - the ocean, the lagoon, towards Diamond Head. The luxury tower of the Hilton Hawaiian Village Hotel was right opposite us and we would drink our wine just staring at it and wondering who could afford the penthouses on top! I actually felt sorry for the people in them as their view was the Ilikai which to be honest looks like an old rundown block of flats in my native UK.The view of their pools was also great and a nightly luau was our entertainment. The walk right into Waikiki was OK but if you're doing it everyday you might want to wear runners. Buy your groceries at Foodland which is walkable to the Ala Moana Mall on the NW corner, 2nd level. Cab back cost $10 with tip. Book any trips with Summer Sells, the concierge at the Ilikai (that's acutally her name) she was very informative and her prices came out cheaper than when I looked online. We ate at the bar and grill only once. Unfortunately it was about 9:30pm at night, the tables were dark and my son ordered a cheeseburger. It wasn't until the last few bites that I noticed it was still pink. They took it back and said it was medium rare. I was furious at myself for not checking at first. The waiter said he would not charge us for it but with a laugh said he couldn't pay for the hospital bill. That put us off for the rest of the holiday but fortunately my son did not get sick.

The condo is exactly as pictured and the view is beautiful. Having a kitchen was a huge benefit. The location was perfect for us, with a very nice walk down the beach to the heart of Waikiki for shopping or dining. Ala Moana Centre is just a 10 min walk the other way, with everything you need, and there is an ABC store right across the street from the Ilikai. The Hilton Lagoon was great for the kids and they loved renting the stand up paddle boards. The beach is rocky, so water shoes are a good idea for the ocean, but otherwise, the Ilikai and Waikiki were a perfect fit for us. The Bar and Grill on the main level past the lobby had very good food. We ate there for breakfast and dinner, all good. Honolulu is a great city with lots to see and do. I recommend hiking Diamond Head, taking in all the sites and museums at the Pearl Harbor site, and definitely take a day and spend it on the North Shore! We stopped at Shark's Cove, Waimea Valley where you can swim under the falls, and absolutely go to Macky's shrimp truck for lunch while in Hale'iwa town! It parks beside the 7-11 on the edge of town--the best garlic shrimp around! (this was a tip by a local and we were SO glad we had lunch there!) Then grab a Shave Ice at Matsumto right on the main road in town. Enjoy Sam's condo and the area, it was a blast for us and we wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Ilikai again.","Calgary, Canada","travlfamly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",57,4.0

It probably looks like one of the more dated hotels actually, but once inside, it is well maintained and clean. Definitely one of the those don't judge a book by its cover situations. The location of the hotel was perfect. It's a good 10-15 walk into the bustling parts of Waikiki but good for those looking for a quieter environment, especially at night. The last time I visited Honolulu, we stayed in the heart of Waikiki where the noise of buses, cars, tourists, etc never seemed to let up. Coffee, McDonald's, ABC store and a diner of sorts are in the immediate vicinity of the hotel as well as other smaller shops.The beach and the Hilton lagoon are almost directly behind the hotel. The beach is a little rocky and the lagoon water always colder than the beach (not good for wimpy people like me), so if you're looking to spend time at a nice beach, plan on driving somewhere else. The lagoon is a good option for people traveling with small kids though.The pool is a decent size and pretty well maintained. The only drawback is you can't consume any outside food or drink. The other drawback of the Ilikai is the parking situation. You can only park there using their valet service which is $22/day and does not include gratuity. There is a public lot immediately behind the hotel but you pay based on the time you will be parked (you can pay to park for 10 hours but there are no in and out privileges). If you're visiting Honolulu for the first time, you probably don't need a car as all the things you would want to do/see are within walking distance or can reach easily by bus. Overall, I had a great stay at the Ilikai and would definitely return...just wish they'd do something about the parking...it's a total rip off.","San Francisco, California","CA_mom10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",4,4.0

The condo was very spacious with approximately 1300 square feet.

I struggle price-wise to find a balance between beach front and great hotel amenities to interest him. We almost hit the mark with the Ilikai.Rooms at the I' are very comfy. Nothing new or outstanding about them. We had a large, 25th floor room. So large that other seating could easily have fit in the room and would have been welcomed. Although the bathroom had some appearance of remodeling, it stopped at the tub/shower area. If your kids are active, the I' Hotel might not be for you. The pool was a little disappointing and as our room looked out over the far end of the famed (insert hotel name) Hawaiian Villiage, my son had a lot of 'pool' envy. I later found out that the pool used to be the kiddie pool before the Ilikai gave over some property to a newer boutique hotel. I know several military families awaiting housing set up camp in the I' Hotel, so they might want to work on some reciprocity with one of the nearby properties (just a thought).The staff of the hotel was good. The front desk was always friendly and helpful. The concierge is also very helpful. Location was excellent for me. I'd read other reviews about how noisy Waikiki properties were. The I' Hotel is at the far western edge of Waikiki, making it more of a ""Honolulu"" property. You can sun out in front of other properties or at the lagoon. There's a bus line right out front. If you want to get your exercise, Waikiki and Ala Moana are within walking distance. The hotel provides regular sized beach towels (true 'beach' not plain towels). There's a small, nicely equipped gym. Lots of elevators, so no long wait, plus a 'swimmers'' elevator. Laundry facilities on (I think) every floor.If you're staying for longer than a week, especially with kids, I highly recommend bringing an extra bag with non-perishable staples like cereal, pop tarts, packaged snacks, pretzels (chips might get crushed), canned soups, popcorn, juice boxes, (shelf) milk, plastic utensils; I' Hotel has microwaves and small fridges in rooms. I was fortunate not to have to pay for my bags, but even with the bag charge, you'll save money (you might want to box it up instead of a bag or nestle the empty bag in a larger one for the return flight).If you get the ""upgrade at reservation for small fee"" option, take it. We upgraded at check in to an ocean view, 25th floor room, which was great. If you do get a room overlooking the lagoon, order pizza in on Friday (or go for a late dinner) as this is where the fireworks are set off.Overall, I had a good experience and stay at the Ilikai.","Bay Area Houston, Texas","DonnaR66</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bay Area Houston, Texas</strong>",10,4.0

Great pool for the kids and the lagoon and beach are very close by. Lots of fun toys for them to take to the beach. King bed extremely comfortable. Ample storage. Kitchen well equipped (would be good to have an electric jug/kettle). Great to have use of wireless internet and free local calls. We were treated to a hula show on the roof of the hotel next door almost everynight as well which was great! The only challenge for us was that our children are young and easily woken so once they were in bed we needed to be very quiet and minimise the lighting as there was only a thin sliding door between the bedroom and the rest of the apartment. The apartment isn't newly renovated but this doesn't matter. It is light and bright and has everything you need. Nice view of the water off to the right. A great way to wake up each day! Great to have the kitchen facilities particularly with children. Our preferred grocery shop was The Pantry about 10 mins walk away. Fresh food and salads and some brands from home. We also tried Foodland (a small Woolies or IGA in Oz) but didn't think it was as good. Don Quiyote is also meant to be great but we didn't manage to get there. We would stay in the apartment again if it was the two of us. A great affordable option with all the added features you don't get in a hotel room.

Both free and metered parking is available around hotel but is a gamble being a very busy area. Taxis are always lined up at hotel front and OK if you plan to do go any distance. Though not really a ""city bus person"", my 2 friends and I did use them for some local jaunts to areas within about 30 min of hotels.

We were a family with a 2 year boy, so booked ina 2 bedroom suite with sea view. The second room is partioned off by sliding doors but was ample for our needs. The full kitchen allowed us to cook when we required. Its in a great location, being at the quiet end of the beach. Its a 10 minute walk to the AlaMoana shopping centre, which is noted for its shops but we should also note the food court has some great ""restaraunts"", with takeaway food. The supermarket has a great range of cooked or prepared meals. They ask you for your phone number, just give it to them as this enrolls you in their club, which provides instant discounts. From then on just mention your phone number and they will apply the discounts.Across the road from the hotel are a number of restaraunts and bars. The bar downstairs is a great wee local, with $5 breakfasts. The buffalo wings bar is large and focuses on the sports and varsity crowds. great basic food and is set up for kids. There are 2 car rental companies alamo and national. while they have a gfreat range of cars i would recommend booking online to get a better discount. You can park behind the ilikai at the wharf for $12 for 24 hours, and its only a 2 minute walk to the hotel. If you're keen on shopping there is a bus stop outside the ilikai which takes you the Waikele Outlet centre and return for $5. be early as its popular, but luckily this is the first stop on both journeys. There is a new coffee shop in the ilikai which made ok coffee (please note kiwis are coffee snobs and everybody else thought it was great), but had great cakes and nibbles. The swimming pool is heated as we later found out and my 2 year old definitely preferred that compared to the sea. there are a number of elderly ladies who come down to the pool from their condo's in the early morning, and they're a great source of information and fun. There are 2 ABC stores basically next to the hotel. The one diagonally across the road is a specialist fruit and vegetable shop so great source of fresh food. booze was cheap in these stores. I bought some New Zealand beers for less than what i would pay in NZ, whats that all about! We probably won't be back for awhile as we'll try new places but i can thoroughly recommend the ilika. The staff were all great (thanks tammy for sorting out my problem with the international date line and having a booking for the day AFTER we arrived). Right next door is the Hilton and they welcome you to their restaraunts but not the pools. great location and value for money","Wellington, New Zealand","irishkiwitraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, New Zealand</strong>",23,5.0

The Ilikai has changed owners about 3 or 4 times since we started going there and it has seen some ups and downs. One year we went there and the shops, pool and restaurants were closed and it looked very neglected. We were there again in May and I have to say that it is looking more like its former self. I really think the new hotel ""Edition"" in what was once part of the Ilikai has really helped a lot.. It is a lovely place for couple or families and you could not ask for better views and being so close to the ocean is wonderful. It is cheaper to rent a condo than to stay through the hotel directly and of course you have full kitchens so can control your budget a little better. we just love the fact that after a long day out or in the water it is nice to come back and relax and you don't have to go out to eat if you don't want to.We have friends that stay at other hotels along Waikiki and we have also stayed at other hotels but the beach is so less crowded down by the Ilikai and you are close to the Mall, the locals beach, Magic Island and of course you can enjoy the Hilton Hawaiian at night with all the lovely trees lit up or go see the penguins or flamingoes or the beautiful koi pnds they have throughout the grounds. We love to walk up town at night which only takes about 10 minutes and then walk your dinner off on the way back to the hotel.There are 11 of us going back in November and we are staying at the Ilikai hotel and the Ilikai Marina.

Wonderful service. We had a 2 bedroom suite as we had a toddler with us so was great to have the extra room we could close off (shutter doors, so 2nd room not quite as private). House keeping did a great job as well and everyone very friendly. The pool has had new furniture since we were there last and that looks much better. Pool never packed and there was always sun loungers available. Never as busy as some other hectic hotels we used to walk past on the beach. We only had breakfast once this time downstairs and service/ food nice. The restaurant downstairs has burgers etc, just the standard snacks available but we enjoyed it.

The fresh market offered twice a week in the courtyard area of the Ilikai is a must do. Fresh fruits, breads, loaves, salads, etc at great prices. The best thing about the Ilikai is the location. Close to the beach with its own walkway. Close to the marina. My wife loves to shop so the close proximity to the Ala Moana Shopping Center was very advantageous. There is also many great eating establishments within walking distance. The trolleys and public transit bus stop just outside.

I stayed in a private condo but my review will only share my thoughts on the hotel as a whole since each condo/unit has it's own quirks.The building itself is located at the marina side of Waikiki, right next door to the massive Hilton complex. I particularly like this side of Waikiki because you avoid the craziness of the middle/end section of the beach which gets super crowded. The beach in front of the Hilton is nice and pretty calm with plenty of room on the beach without feeling like you're so close to the next body. Also being close to the Hilton means you can enjoy the nearby restaurants and my favorite, Lappert's ice cream! It's also 10 minute walk to Ala Moana shopping center and 15 minute from International Marketplace. The building is super old - it looks like it hasn't been renovated since the original Hawaii Five-O filming days. There's not much to the hotel, the pool is small and what's that, no kiosk to print my boarding pass? That's lame. If you go to concierge be prepared to have done your homework as they will sell you not the best tours but the ones that probably give them the most incentive $$. They also try to get you to a timeshare sales pitch and offer the tours for free. No thanks.Here's my tip about parking if you are staying at the Ilikai. Don't do valet, period. I saw lines every morning with people waiting for their car. Yes it's a ridiculous $22/day with in/out privileges but the waiting plus the tips each time to get your car makes this not worth it. To make it more disgusting, they charged $30/day for the July 4th weekend. Not cool. If you want affordable parking, have a car for more than 3 days, and don't mind a 5-10 walk, park at the Hale Koa parking garage at Fort Derussy (right across the street from the Hilton entrance). Non-hotel guests can self-park there for $16/day with in/out privileges by getting a 3-day minimum parking pass. Get the parking pass at the office in the parking garage. The other option is to park in the Ilikai Marina parking garage, behind the Red Lobster restaurant. It was $10 for 10 hour parking with $4 for each additional 1/2 hour. If you're an early riser, this might be a good option.My condo was great and I would consider staying again in a private condo. But if you are looking for a hotel room, I would book somewhere else. I've stayed at the Hilton next door and the rooms were good, the bed was comfy plus you get the benefits of the awesome resort amenities.","San Francisco, California","lucidlilies</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",56,3.0

The Ilikai Hotel is a hotel, but there are private condominiums within the building -- know what you're booking when you book. They are not all the same.My review refers to unit #1318, which I booked through waikikioceanfrontrentals.com. This unit had been recently renovated by the owners and included a master suite with king-sized bed, whirlpool tub, separate shower and bathroom stall and double sinks, plus a second ""bedroom"" (a section of the living room which could be separated by a moveable divider) with two twin beds, a new contemporary kitchen, spacious living room, and large lanai overlooking the ocean. It was attractively furnished, in superb condition, spotlessly clean, and perfect for our family of four. And aside from a minor glitch with regard to our final payment, we enjoyed a smooth and easy transaction with Waikiki Oceanfront Rentals. I was provided a key code which allowed me to check in without hassle upon our arrival in Hawaii.By staying in a private condo I had access to all the amenities related to the resort, including the laundry area (one on each floor) and pool, but none of the hotel services. This was a perfect arrangement for us.The Ilikai Resort itself is old -- it was featured in the opening to the original Hawaii Five-O TV show -- but has clearly been renovated over the years and I found it more than acceptably updated. I enjoyed the location: situated on the very end of Waikiki Beach, within easy walking distance of the beach, restaurants in Waikiki, and even a major shopping mall in Honolulu. While some might prefer to be right in the center of the action, I couldn't have been more pleased with the location.The only downside is parking. There is none, except for valet service. They will tell you that there is parking at the marina, but that, while reasonably priced, is a nightmare, requiring you to move the car every certain number of hours. The valet service cost $22/day with unlimited in/out privileges, but I think the whole valet thing is a pain, especially if you're returning to your hotel multiple times in a day. Tips and wait time add up quickly.","Ashland, Massachusetts","Eohippus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ashland, Massachusetts</strong>",196,4.0

I sort of knew what to expect in regards to the outside of the hotel from previous reviews and also from Ala Moana skyline shots. As previously stated the outside of the hotel is rather dated. Also, the hallway on the inside leading to the rooms is rather dated as well. Still, the entrance and lobby let me know quickly that I was truly in paradise. As a family of 5 we booked a two bedroom suite. When we walked into the room we were definitely in awe of the beauty of the view. The two lanai's were huge and served as the perfect view each morning and evening we were there. In fact, we had a terrific view of the luau taking place at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. The two bedroom was really not a two bedroom suite. There was a huge living room and a sliding door between the living room and the area where the two double beds were situated. The kitchen had only a mini-fridge. I was a bit disappointed and surprised there because my mom had a single mountain view room and she had a full sized refrigerator. Still, there were two sizable bathrooms which we certainly appreciated.The room was clean for the most part. I did find hair from a previous visitor in the bath tub which was a bit of a turn off. The furnishings were a bit worn and utilized but entirely comfortable and not dreadful. The beds were extremely comfortable and there were both soft and firm pillows on the bed. So, you could easily take your pick according to preference. The sheets were clean, crisp and perfectly relaxing after a day of touring and sun bathing. The light blocking shades had holes in them. So, light could not be entirely blocked. There were two flat screened TV's with cable which was completely convenient and handy for my little ones to sit and unwind.One thing I was worried about was being able to stock up on supplies and what food places were immediately nearby. There is an ABC store of course across the street but there is also a Food Pantry on Hobron if you walk down just a little bit. It is seriously a full fledged grocery store. Anything from red meat to milk and fresh produce can easily be purchased there and is cheaper than the ABC store. Also there is a McDonald's and Buffalo Wild Wings directly across the street as well as a fish and Indian restaurant. At the end of the block is an IHOP and a local breakfast spot, Wailana Coffee House which I heard is really good. There is also a Red Lobster and an Outback Steakhouse at the corner of Ala Moana and Hobron (which is the intersection if you head to the left coming out of the hotel).We did not like the beach closest to the hotel or the lagoon. Waikiki Beach was a bit to pebbly and rocky for us. The most beautiful beach of our entire trip was Lanikai Beach which you would need to drive to. If you do drive out there you simply must stop by Island Snow in Kailua.Overall, I would definitely stay at the Ilikai over and over again. Everyone was extremely nice and my reservations were exact and according to my specifications. Check-in was also a breeze.

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the room. It is a very large room with nice ammenities and very clean. The bed was really nice and the view (although the company where i booked stated ocean view) was decent. my view was blocked by my own hotel if that makes any sense. The Hotel design was so that the rooms towards the middle of the hotel have a partial ocean view. I was on the 24th floor which honestly was a little too high, although i did have a nice view of the Luau that the Hilton puts on daily. (the Hitlon Hawaiin Village is next door). The location was pretty good. I think that it is pretty much the first hotel on the strip. So, it kind of depends on what you want. If you want to be right smack in the middle of Waikiki then you might want to go further down the strip. If you want to be 5-10 minutes away and still be able to walk or take a cab to most places then this will suit you fine. Watch out for the parking prices. All the Hotels charge a 20 a day parking cost. There are nice stores inside the hotel to include a mailing service which was very resonable. Of course once you get outside there are literally hundreds of places to shop and thosands of people shopping there. Overall I was pleased with my stay, the customer service and the quality of the room. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants a modestly priced room in Waikiki.","Okinawa City, Japan","aronszekely</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Okinawa City, Japan</strong>",24,4.0

Having been to Waikiki before, we were familiar with the location of the Ilikai. The Ilikai sits away from the central hub of Waikiki. To the front is the main road, to the rear the beach/ marina. Buses and trolley buses stop outside the hotel. A walk to central Waikiki strip is a flat, easy 15 minute walk either along the road or along the beach. Little tipsy at Dukes ? Take the trolley bus home for $2. The Ala Moana mall can be found 10 min walk in the other direction. That $2 trolley ride home to the front door comes in handy with all those shopping bags. Restaurants n shops are all seconds away. More eating and shopping can be done at the Hilton Hawaiian Village next door.Our room. Ocean view on the 22nd floor. Overlooking the pool n the hilton lagoon area giving a perfect view of the Friday night fireworks and the nightly luau at the Hilton. Huge bedroom with great size lanai met my approval. Fridge , safe and two wardrobes. Dressing area. Bathroom n bedroom lovely n clean. Downside? After the big bedroom , the bathroom is a let down. Yes it's clean n nice enough but it's Tiny ! Toilet was between the sink counter top and the shower. Shower had a curtain and was a big shower but no light in the actual shower made it dreadfully dark and u have to basically push past the toilet to get in n out of it. To be fair, having spoken to another person staying there, they didn't feel their bathroom was small so maybe we were unlucky. I would suggest replacing the curtain with a glass shower door to let it more light n possibly make it feel larger. For the price, this is excellent value.If u like to be in the thick of things , maybe this isn't for you but if u enjoy a stroll this should be on your short list.

I explained to the reservations agent that I would be traveling with 3 teenagers and a person using a wheelchair, we wanted to cut costs by cooking in the room. Once in the room I found that their idea of a full kitchen should be called a partial kitchen or efficiency kitchen. This full kitchen consisted of a stove top, a microwave oven, and a dorm sized refrigerator. As far as kitchen utensils are concerned, this full kitchen had three glasses, four plates and bowls with silverware(except butter knives), two pots, one flying pan.... no food preparation dishes. This full kitchen had no oven other than the very small microwave. Since the hotel offered grocery service(a nice amenity), we ordered some groceries to have in the room when we arrived. Most of that had to be trashed since the full kitchen had a refrigerator similar to the one I used in my college dormitory. When I talked to the manager about the fact this room was not what I asked for nor paid for, he did offer me 2 one bedroom rooms with full kitchens. I did not take the rooms since I could not separate the teenagers and the handicapped persons from me and we had been in our existing room for almost three days. They did bring up another dorm sized refrigerator to be placed in the middle of the kitchen and more kitchen utensils to sustain the 5 persons I have in the room. I was very disappointed with the bait and switch type service that I received considering I specifically explained what I needed as well as how many persons would be sharing this room. So when requesting this hotel, it is possible that you will not receive what you asked. However, I have to give credit to the on site hotel employees. They were very helpful, kind and friendly. I have to give kudos to Glenda in housekeeping, Sara at the outside bar/grill and Laure at the concierge/tour desk. Spa facilities consisted of two rooms, practically non- existent though highly publicized on the online website. The gym was very small with no air conditioning . Bring your own pool towels. The towels you get at the pool with the 15$ pool towel cards(if you don't return the cards) look like they have been used for ten years or more. A person needs 2 of these towels to cover the pool lounge chairs. You best bet is to go next door the Hilton and see how they view a room with a full kitchen.","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","mrreed2000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>",4,3.0

Most hotel rooms were very pricy for an oceanfront view, but not at Ilikai. We definitely got our moneys worth. The check in and check out were smooth. The front desk went out of their way to get us a scale to weigh our luggage. The best thing about this hotel is the friendliness of the entire staff. The swimming pool is small, but who needs it when the ocean is practically outside your room. My husband and I are not experienced travelers, but I don't think you can get lost in Waikiki. We only got a rental car for one day to drive around the island (a must)! The other days we either walked (to Honolulu Zoo, Ala Moana Center, and all Waikiki Beach Walk); we also used the bus transportation or shuttle services. Be sure to check out Pearl Harbor and Germaines Luau. If you drive around the island, I recommend eating at a restaurant on the North Shore: Grass Skirt Grill.

The rooms have ample space, the bathroom was shower only but look new. The restaurant on top is a must, great service, great food, great view if you can snag a window table.

Big rooms with a nice view. Bathrooms are decent size and have separate bath and shower Hotel is not in the heart of Waikiki, but easily within walking distance or a very short cab/trolley ride away. This hotel is right next to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. There are plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, etc nearby. The Ala Moana Mall is only a short distance from the hotel and there is a trolley that takes you to and from the Mall or other hotels for the price of $2.00. I did not order room service, but did use the Ilikai Bar & Grill. The food and drinks there were very good - pulled pork sandwich and coconut shrimp were my favorites. I did not eat at Sarento's on top of the ""I"", but it is a higher-end option onsite. Honestly, there are so many good places to eat in Waikiki at many different price ranges, you should try them (Cheesecake Factory is my favorite - try the shrimp scampi (add kalamata olives) or bang bang chicken and shrimp. Finish off with the chocolate coconut cream cheesecake). Back to the hotel, I had a fantastic stay and highly recommend the Ilikai with it's cozy location near the marina/beach, but just far enough away from the crowded Waikiki norm. I did not have a rental car for this trip and got around just fine. I am however, very familiar with Waikiki/Oahu.

We stayed in a privately owned apartment booked through a separate company. So l cannot comment on what the hotel side of things were. That being said, we did use all the facilities so l can give a review on those, just not the hotel rooms themsleves.The reception area is big, and well maintained. The conceirge desk is well manned with knowledgable people who were a great help. The reception is accessed via stairs or if you have a pram, via a lift round the side of the entrance, a little annoying but nothing to worry about too much.The bar area is good, they serve bar food eg: pizza, tapas etc and a good selection of cocktails. The pool area is however separate from the bar area so if one wanted a drink/food and it was outside the hours of 1-5pm, you had to leave the pool area, and walk a distance to the bar. The waitstaff is on 1-5 and he is attentative, albeit quick with the hand for tips. There was one lady at the pool towel desk who was a little stern. Another guest had a 2 year old and they gave her a cracker to eat. This lady went over to them and told them they couldnt eat anything by the hotel pool that was not brought at the bar??!!? She was 2!!! dont know how a 2 year old would go with some shrimp from the tapas menu at 9am in the morning!! They told her how ridiculous it was and she left them, and me with my two kids, alone from then on thank god. Also, we have a 1 yr old who is crawling and as the pool is older style with concrete surrounds, we could not let her crawl on the floor as the concrete got very very hot, it is also rough and would have damaged her knees. The pool itself doesnt have a particularly nice outlook. You either look into a hedge or if you face into the resort, a really ugly air con tower. Not much shade either. There was one nook to the right as you went in but that was a coveted place and hard to get. That being said, we noticed that many surroinding resorts either didnt have a pool or theirs was on a roof and less atractive than this one. We were warned by a travel agent that as many resorts are aging , their pools are not spectacular as we'd come to expect here in Oz, but as long as you are warned, you will find it enjoyable regardless.On Friday night, the hotel puts on a mini-luau under the big tree behind reception. The start before the Hilton fireworks, then pause for the fireworks, then resume. Great free entertainment, unless you eat at the buffet, which we didnt. It looked very limited in choices, not sure of the price. The hotel is located in such a great area, next to the Hilton so its great to wander over there. On the other side is The Edition Hotel. Wowzer, this place is amazing. You can eat at the restaurants and drink at the bar, but not use their amazing pool unfortunately. Same with the Hilton Village. We were also persuaded to attend a sales presentation at the hotel. For our efforts my husband got a free scuba sesson valued at $125. The give you a one off 'gift' of your choice, then heavily discounted prices on other activities you book through them. If you are planning on doing a few activities, its worth sitting through the 1.5 hour one on one presentation to get your activities cheaper. Our car hire should have been $75 a day but as we attended the sales presentation we got it for $45. Hope this helps. Overall, l would recommend this place.","Sydney, Australia","shylowinspear1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",53,4.0

The condos have full kitchens, which is a plus for those with children that aren't into eating at restaurants three times a day. The pool is relatively small, but adequate.

Booked on-line for a one room Condo with kitchen. Had a great view up close of the Lagoon and Beach. Harbour view would have allowed great sunset views, but we didn't spend much time in our room, so it didn't matter. Because we booked with a rental agency, we did not have room service for cleaning every day (they clean after you leave). We aren't slobs, so this wasn't a problem. Plenty of clean towels are provided. Laundry facilities are on every floor if needed. No place in Waikiki is going to be quiet, so if you want quiet, best to go to another part of the island. We did not find it a problem. Once you close the glass doors, it's quiet. The rooms are quiet, we never heard any noise, tv, talking, or other toilets flushing. No smoking allowed in the building. Parking is at the Marina behind the hotel. It's $5.00 for 10 hours. We only needed a car for 2 days, and relied on public transportation the rest of the time. Ten minute walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Center, 10-15 minutes to Waikiki. Nice walk on the beach to all the hotel area. A really great Greek restaurant close by that was a favorite. Free shopping trolley stops out front, bus lines close by. China town was a fast bus ride. In short, a good location. We have stayed at the Hilton Village in the past.Family members booked a room close to us but had emergency surgery 14 days before we traveled. The booking agency was able to open up that date, and it was rented out, but family was told they would not get a refund because they were doing ""spring cleaning"". We met the people who rented that room. They were not cleaning it. I'm sure they get by with this all the time because how can people check on them? While we did not have any problems, I have lost respect for this ocean front rental company because of their lack of integrity.

The staff wasn't very friendly or knowledgeable. When I went to the bar to get a pina colada to take back to my room I had to wait until the waitress and other staff member finished their conversation about their outings the night before. I had to interupt to ask for my drink because apparently this was not going to be a short conversation. I was standing right next to them waiting patiently but they didn't seem to care.

Not a sound was to be heard once inside the room - no TV, no flushing toilets, no chichat from the room next door, etc. A bit of noise from the street but we soon grew accustomed to it. Access to all the places we wanted to go was great and enjoyed the Hilton Hawaiian Resort next door too. The Friday night Hawaiian entertainment put on by the hotel was great and we really enjoyed it. The small restaurant and bar could expand the menu a bit perhaps, but we liked the well-poured drinks and burgers. Staff here were exceptionally efficient and helpful to us.The coffee shop with freshly made sandwiches, Kona coffee, muffins, juice and other goodies was very good and the folks in there very friendly and helpful. Both restaurants were happy to provide you with take-out and we had food on our lanai one evening and watched the sunset - spectacular. We also both heard and watched the Honolulu Marathon over in Ala Moana Park and all the comings and goings - could hear the music too! Our biggest disappointment - which had nothing to do with the folks in the hotel - was the restaurant Sarantos at the Top of the I -- very pricey - questionable food - indifferent service. We went on a Tuesday evening - on entering room seemed empty and tables unappealing (too early perhaps?) - we ordered two pasta dishes - one with scampi and one with mushrooms. They arrived in bowls with little eye-appeal, the scampi were very salty, as was the whole plate and the flavor was masked by the over-use of oil. The pasta did not taste freshly made to us. In short, we were not happy with our dinner, the cost, the service, or the fact the restaurant billed itself as 4 star. It reflects badly, in our view, on the hotel and is not even run by the hotel but I don't know if the guests are aware of this. To be fair - perhaps we hit them on an off night, but we were so looking forward to eating there often and sampling their whole menu - alas it was not to be. Got a kick out of the folks at the bell desk and the routine of clapping for the cabs. Great place to stay - wish we had longer. Keep it up folks - the secret will soon be out to all.","Edmonton, Canada","oldporcupine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",6,5.0

This Y shaped building is in front of the Ala Wai Harbor and right next door to Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort. There is a large U shaped driveway to pull up to unload your belonging and groceries, where you are greeted by friendly and very helpful Valet Staff. The building has a beautiful but small walk up entrance with rock waterfall on either side of center staircase up to large beautiful dolphin sculpture. There is an escalator or elevator for use as well. Upon walking into large open air lobby it is clean, relaxed feeling, some shops and restaurants and if you walk straight through to view of gardens and harbor there are tables and umbrellas. There is a cement walkway that leads Ilikai residents over to the Hilton Lagoon and beginning of Waikiki beach strip. The pool is quite, pleasant enough, clean and more private than large resort area pools! Being that we rented through a private owner condo we did not have access to the fitness center.The Ilikai Hotel building can be rented through the hotel, Shell Vacations or private owners and their rental agents. The hotel owns the top levels of the building, with the leg of Y as oceanfront rooms one side has lagoon to ocean views next to HHVlg and the other side has harbor and sunset views. The top of Y arms have same views with right side on HHVlg side and left side Harbor and Sunset, while the top of the arms are mountain and city views.We went up to the very top of Ilikai building to Sarento's Italian Restaurant on Thursday evenings they have live excellent Jazz group, beware they charge a $10 per person ""music fee"" while seated at table for dinner $! The service is VERY slow and a bit unorganized, but if you can bare the wait while listening to awesome music all our food selections were excellent!!! Not one of us was unhappy with our dinners! The four of us split two salads which was plenty, they serve warms breads in basket and the cocktails were strong. There is a bar if you just want cocktails and appetizers while listening to music, along with awesome views in every direction from windows around entire restaurant!Our rental experience was very painless, efficient and the pictures on the website were exactly what we happily received when entering condo unit. Very clean, well decorated, large, well stocked kitchen, great view of HHVlg Lagoon to ocean especially for Friday night Hilton fireworks and excellent value for rental fee paid $! Could not have asked for anything more, extremely happy with condo and rental service!!! We will definitely rent again from WaikikiOceanFrontRentals and stay at the Ilikai $!","Chicago, Illinois","Tredpositive</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",81,5.0

We were granted a seniors discount and we given a room on the 24 floor overlooking the ocean and the fireworks at the Hilton Hotel next door. All our requests were met. We were also allowed a 1 o'clock check out which allowed us the do the Pearl Harbor Tour prior to check out. The room was renovated and everthing looked great. We were disappointed that we could not get a reservation at the roof top ""Sorrentos"" as they were booked up. So if you are staying at this hotel on a Friday night and want to see the Fireworks while eating, book a reservation in advance of your arrival. We ended up eating at the bar grill patio and everything was good.

It was quiet and peaceful at all times. The large windows opened out to a gorgeous view and the curtains over them kept out the early morning light when we wanted to sleep in. The kids of course loved the great new flat screen tv. It was very spacious even with the couch pulled out into a bed. We used the fully stocked kitchen for making scrumptious breakfasts and snacks. We did walk to the many restaurants for lunch and dinner. It was great to walk either by the beach or by Ala Moana Blvd to get to any of the eateries we felt like. The mall was really close too with a great food court and grocery store - food land. The coffee place at Illakai was great and so was the Kona Bean right across the road. The bar downstairs was perfectly situated with a view of the ocean. The stores downstairs were useful when we needed something in a hurry. Of course the many ABC stores were ubiquitous. We always saw people cleaning the walkways. We relaxed by the pool some times which had clean towels and shower. We could order drinks and food from the bar to have by the poolside. Friday evening if you were tired to walk to a restaurant, you could enjoy the hula, music and fireworks (on the lagoon) downstairs.  Our favorite time was sipping wine as we watched the sunset from the lanai. The view from the bed and lanai was breathtaking. Most mornings we ate our papaya and pineapple on the lanai watching the early surfers take the waves.  Most mornings we had time to go for a jog along the park which we could see from the lanai.","Arlington, Virginia","brajaram1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",3,5.0

The front staff was super friendly and we received a bonus when we were upgraded to an ocean front. We chose a 2 bedroom suite so each of us ladies had our own bed and bathroom. The hotel recently renovated their rooms and they are truly lovely and the kitchenette has granite counter tops. The grounds are beautiful and we were able to watch the Friday night fireworks display from the courtyard. On Friday nights, guests are treated to a hula show.

Even though this hotel is older in style it really is spotlessly maintained in all the common areas. The staff are wonderful and our daily housekeeper was so lovely. The Bedrooms were very roomy , plenty of room for empty suitcases. Only 1 closet in the hallway and no drawers in 2nd bedroom. 2 bathrooms was great, and a bth/shower in en-suite handy for small children. Kitchen had plenty of crockery/cutlery and pots/pans. No dishwasher or oven.The ample size kitchen had a Microwave , coffeemaker,toaster and cooktop and small fridge. Linen changed daily and toilettries and coffee topped up, no tea supplied. Very comfy lounge and chairs, 6 seater dining table and desk with free broaddband. Two lanais with outdoor furniture. In room safe does not fit an average size laptop however. Aircon in lounge area and main bedroom. There is also a washer/dryer on every floor and free daily newspaper. A real plus is the short walk (10 mins max) to Ala Moana centre and 15-20 mins back into Wakiki. We ate in the restaurant downstairs and found it to be good value. We also took advantage of the many ABC stores nearby.The sunsets were mindblowing and the skyline at night was spectacular.We all found it very comfy and homely.The pool is a great temperature and has a decent shallow end for toddlers and an equally decent deep end, around 8ft. Have to agree with previous posts re the ""Pool Nazi"", she certainly maintained the peace in the pool area ! No diving,jumping or bombing (naturally) it was like swimming scared!Overall this is a hidden gem, great location if you dont mind a walk, beach is bigger, HHV is next door, marina out front, Ala Moana shopping close by, trolley and TheBus stops out front too.Im sure to have forgotten something but hope this gives a fair indication of what a really good old place this is !

The staff and concierge were incredibly attentive and the hotel itself is clean and beautiful. I would highly recommend this hotel to my friends. The room was plush and spacious with a separate tub and shower in a very spacious bathroom. The only thing I would suggest is for them to offer large beach towels for trips to the beach. They only gave us white bath towels for the beach which weren't large enough and seemed awkward to be the only ones on the beach with bright white bath towels. We stood out. Other than that, hotel is luxurious and the people were incredibly friendly and made us feel very welcomed. We also used the fitness center which is small but packed with all the necessities. We got a good morning workout before the heat of the day set in. The hotel is walking distance to nightlife on the beach and shopping in Waikiki. The hotel concierge has discounted deals on dining - ask them for a discount booklet. There's cheaper parking available at the boat dock.
