The New Otani was famous years past for hosting the NKK studio dancers for musicals/shows like 42nd street in the 1980s. In the 1990s there was even an attempted assassination of the PM Hosokawa in the business Tower section. The Gardens which were once legendary have been pared down. They are still iconic and in a much smaller scale you can angle shots of the red arched bridge and zen rock display. The garden view cafe used to host breathless fans waiting for the likes of such guests as Rod Stewart, Michael Jackson and Pe Yon Jun. The once vast lobby has been chopped up quite a bit, it once rivaled the Imperial in Hibiya and the Okura in Kamiyachoo. They have a few concept restaurants and still maintain one of the few once glitzy revolving restaurants in Tokyo (can be seen in the photo provided).

I found that I lost my “Louis Vuitton” bag strap in the room after 5 hours of checking out. I am 100% sure that the bag strap was left at the sofa, because we checked out early in the morning and didn't go to any place else. In that checkout morning, the strap was first attached to my bag and then I released it and put it on the sofa, just to take off my coat easily. However, some other issues came up later and disturbed me and then I forgot to attach it back. It is a bright pink, quite wide, cross body leather bag strap, in other words, it's something not tiny but instead could easily get attention. And it is a gift from my husband for our anniversary. We then called the hotel immediately, however, they said the housekeeper didn't report anything and they would call us back if they find it later. We were positive but we never heard anything from the hotel, so we had to come to terms with the fact that nobody actually did anything. It's so hard to believe that the housekeeper didn't see it (such a long, wide, bright pink, cross body “Louis Vuitton” strap), and we are really disappointed.

It is one of Tokyo's great hotels. It is vast and has a gorgeous 400-year-old garden. Basically the hotel is three separate towers located just West of the Imperial Palace and that are linked by a long linking building. The New Otani famously was built for the Tokyo Olympics that took place in 1964. Many aspects of the hotel - the quality of the fabric of the buildings, the furnishings and so on are second to none and gave an opulent feeling to the place. The function rooms are enormous and seem similarly plush; and some of the restaurants we tried were very good. So why only three stars? Well the place to me seemed a little bit stuck in a timewarp. There is an extensive shopping arcade with lots and lots of shops selling expensive dresses. There were also some art galleries but all these outlets seemed short of customers, making me think there were too many shops of the wrong type. We were given vouchers for breakfasts and it took us a while to discover that not all breakfast restaurants in the New Otani are created equal. By the end we found a good breakfast place in the hotel but that was after numerous days of slightly disappointing breakfast locations for which there were long queues at 8 am. However for me the kicker was that the hotel has a gym and pool club membership of which cost about €30 a day. Considering what the accommodation cost this was steep. The hotel does provide free workout rooms but these are basically recycled bedrooms with some treadmills, elliptical trainers and a floor mat in them. The one nearest my room also had a chest press machine but no other weights equipment. I would say the maximum number of people who could use that room at a time was about ten. For a luxury hotel I have to say the exercise provision was poor unless you were prepared to spend a lot of money on temporary gym membership.","Nottingham, United Kingdom","266timothyp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nottingham, United Kingdom</strong>",70,3.0

Comfortable to sit and have tea - but not to lounge.The King Size bed was comfortable with foam and feather pillows and down comforter.

Both rooms had separate tubs and showers with super strong water pressure - the tubs fill in 3 minutes.English TV options are limited to CNN, BBC, MSN and Bloomberg TV with some Japanese news channels available at times in English. No HBO, Showtime or other cable options. Poor movie selections.Good AC Controls.So many restaurants to choose from it's mind boggling.

You need a map to navigate among all the facilities on site. Hotel guests are served with obliging and eager staff meeting most, if not all, your demands, in precision and reasonably fluent English. Parcels I received whilst being a guest were promptly and securely delivered to my room. Choices of included breakfast, across different restaurants, are amazing. The traditional Japanese-style breakfast overseeing the gardens and waterfall was quite a dining experience. The more popular option would presumably be the buffet up on Level 40 in the Garden Tower, offering a mixed Western and Japanese selection, and a sensational view of the Tokyo Tower and the Imperial grounds, essentially at least 270 degrees of view around the tower, being the highest building in its vicinity. Guest room was clean and sufficient for my stay. The decor could have been dated, but I did not spend enough time staring at the decor to appreciate it. Bathroom was not luxurious, but adequate. The downside was the huge size of the complex making staying in the Main Tower tricky for accessing the Metro Stations at the South side of the complex. The arcade is on the basement floor. The separate reception at the Garden Tower is on the same floor as the Main Tower, designated as Floor 2, but exiting to the street you will walk into the ‘office’ block at its Floor 6. There on you exit to Akasaka, an amazing upscale and wealthy district in which every corner out from the Metro station is interesting, the shrines are unique and the restaurants are of a spill of international varieties.The gardens on the hotel ground are probably enough reason to stay here for even just one night.","Sydney, Australia","jkl615</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",83,4.0

These were so hard and uncomfortable that I was not able to sleep well at all, for six straight nights. Not good. There are only three English TV channels: CNN, BBC, and CNBC. The garden is very nice, but you can't actually see it at all from a ""garden view"" room in The Main tower, so don't be deceived when you're making a reservation. You'll only see the tops of trees and rooftops. The hotel is in a good location in central Tokyo and there's a train station nearby, but if you're staying in The Main, you'll have a long walk (ten or fifteen minutes) all the way to the other end of the hotel (Garden Court tower) before you even get to the street to walk to the station. The most disappointing thing is that everything in all the hotel shops and most of the restaurants is ridiculously overpriced. Only the super-rich could buy any of it.

For example, the main breakfast buffet has a good selection of food but the price (£42) is crazy. The breakfast buffet in the Terrace restaurant is marginally cheaper but poor quality. Most absurd of all is the pricing in the terrace restaurant for a cup of tea (£10!). My advice is to find somewhere smaller and more accessible.

On check in we were then told we’d have to pay a late check in fee which was more than what we’d paid for the night, it took about 15 mins before they would accept that we had paid already for the night. We then got to our room which looked so old and dated, and the carpet was not particularly clean. My husband went to ask if there was another room available and after keeping him waiting more than 30 mins was told there was only a room with twin beds, which wasn’t an option for us.

We wanted somewhere that was a nice hotel and in a good location that was not too highly priced but offered a lot of quality.We stayed here 4 nights and I’ll break up my review into two themes:Hotel and Facilities:Checkin was very smooth and despite flying the red eye from Singapore and arriving mid-morning we were given a room upon arrival, which was a pleasant surprise and very much needed. I was again very surprised later to find when I opened the door to such a large and spacious room! The bed was amazingly comfy and we both had a great night’s sleep each night. There are many light touches that are very nice; dressing gowns, slippers and plenty of complimentary things in the room and bathroom. The hotel itself is situated in such beautiful surroundings with a fantastic garden with a waterfall. There’s a number of shops on the lobby floor as well as a nice bar at the top floor. Staff were all brilliant, helpful and very friendly.However, the reason I didn’t give the full 5 stars was the ‘Accommodation Tax’ levied upon checkout. There wasn’t a mention of this upon checkin and despite paying in full online beforehand, the 200 yen per night was due on leaving. I think a simple ‘by the way’ or explanation at the checkin process could have made the difference to a 5/5 as I don’t appreciate having hidden costs added at the end.Location:This is the most outstanding part of the Hotel overall. A quick walk through the lobby, past the shops and down the elevator brings you to the street and a further 5 minute walk brings you to Akasaka Mitsuke subway station. This line is well connected to get to Ginza, Shibuya, Roppongi, Shinjuku and Tokyo stations in a very short time. A perfect location to explore central Tokyo and beyond.Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for a short or long visit as well as for business travellers.

You can even eat breakfast overlooking it in one of the many hotel restaurants and there is also a 'Tully's coffee shop' (like a Starbucks or Costa) in the hotel (which suited my wife's need for a daily coffee to supplement traditional Japanese tea).The metro is a short walk (5 mins) away beside which there are a couple of streets full of restaurants (so you don't need to travel into central Tokyo if you don't want to). The metro is very easy to use with numbered stations which mean its very easy to work out which direction to travel in. One thing to bear in mind is that a 24 hour metro ticket (which usefully is not day based but starts when you buy it) isn't usable on all the metro lines (about 8 are included but a further 8 are private and need their own tickets). Hence you need to plan your route using appropriate lines if you don't want to pay more than necessary.It's worth a visit to one of the towers to view Tokyo at night (we went to the Roppongihills tower where the observation deck is outside and allows you to see the more famous lit up towers from a good distance).Food at the hotel is good and there are useful vegetarian options in the western style breakfast buffets.We would recommend staying at the hotel and enjoyed our stay.,,Bill S,16,5.0

Lets start with the good. The staff are extremely friendly and very helpful and the hotel has a lot of amenities including a really nice garden. The location is also pretty good. The only place you can really walk to is Akasaka (I think I have that right) but this is a great place for eating and not bad for shopping, plus there is a really nice shrine. You can't really walk to anywhere else of interest in Tokyo from here (with the exception if the imperial palace if you up for a bit of a stroll) BUT its only a short cab ride away from pretty much all the tourist spots. Now the not so good. Check-in is pretty much a nightmare and takes for ever (big tip here, join the New Otani Club. Its a FREE loyalty scheme but gives you a separate check-in desk and free entrance to the pool plus discounts at most of the restaurants). The hotel seems to be very fond of 1980's carpet. The room was a decent size but about 1/3 of it was taken up with the bathroom, which was actually very well appointed but also very 1980's. The carpet in the room entrance was threadbare and again the decor was a bit dated. The room has floor to ceiling windows, which turned out to be a massive issue. August in Tokyo is very hot. The room has a tiny aircon vent at one end and a controller that seems to make NO difference. With teh curtains open the room becomes unbearably hot almost instantly. Its like sitting in a car in a sunny car park with the windows up. This means when the sun is up you MUST have the curtains shut else you will fry. As the aircon vent is at one end of the room it also means that at night the bed furthest from the aircon has no cooling at all so it makes for very uncomfortable sleeping. The next issue is the lack of storage. This is very odd in a modern hotel. There are lots of very small drawers (sock drawer size) and a large walk-in closet but that's it. So you can hang clothes up but there are no drawers big enough to put any clothes in, so they need to remain in your suitcases. Next is the bed situation. We had 3 adults staying in the room (myself, my wife and our adult son). The pictures on line show nice 3 bed rooms. Actually what we had was a 2 bed room and a medieval torture device that the 3rd person was supposed to sleep on. To be exact it was a hard wooden board with a 2 inch mattress on it. No springs, no comfort. It was honestly more comfortable sleeping on the floor. Let's move away from the room and talk about the amenities. We didn't make it to the pool (which you will need to pay to enter, even as a guest) or the tennis courts, but we did eat at the hotel. This is a big mistake. The food is generally good but, at approx £10 ($13) for a coffee, about the same for a glass of orange juice, £20 ($26) for a BLT and £35 ($45) for a burger, the prices were insane. 3 drinks and a sandwich in the hotel bar cost about £90 ($117). We did eat in the coffee shop once but gave up after an hour when they were unable to provide the waffles we had ordered. We eventually walked out and the manager confirmed we wouldn't be charged but the charge of around £100 still appeared on our bill (for 2 coffee's) and Waffles that were inedible which we didn't eat.So approx £400 ($520) per night and EVERYTHING cost extra and is insanely expensive. In 10 days we managed over £1500 ($1950) in room charges.So, in short, good location, friendly staff, insane prices, poor rooms. Its not actually a bad hotel, it just isn't worth the money.Tokyo, however, is one of the most amazing places on earth. It also has the friendliest and most helpful people and some of the best food I have ever eaten. Its also nowhere near as expensive as its reputation would have you believe.

I dont have excessive or over the top tattoos ( which shoudlnt matter anyway). My tattoos are small and in written says "" life is a dream"" . Is not even offensive. And yet the reason given was that "" in japan mafia yakuza uses tattoos"". Honestly I dont look close to being japanese, far from being mistaken for a yakuza. Just for the record: Im a CEO, I own my company, Im in technology and have seen the best tech guys wearing the best awesome tattoos. And the same goes for artists, accountants, etc...So if they pretend to be an international hotel, they better act like one. Now let me go for food experience. I paid 895USD for a teppanyaki.

The rooms do not have an iron, although you can arrange one via room service. The gardens around the hotel are fantastic and the cafe/restaurant overlooks the garden and waterfall. Its only a short walk, less than 10 mins to at least three metro lines. That pretty much covers the good stuff, now to the bad. Charging AUD20.00 for two take away coffees is just ridicules, and in all honesty the coffee is not that good. We were charged AUD16.00 for a brewed coffee in the cafe. I paid over AUD20.00 for a Strawberry/Ginger soda...the ginger part of the drink came out in a glass bottle, which was poured into a glass. The food and drink prices are just way over the top and you need to be very specific when ordering a coffee....stay clear of the brewed coffee, it is rubbish and I can't believe they serve this in such a high standard hotel.

This is only the 2nd time for me visiting Tokyo. The first time, I stayed at Shiodome, so quite far from Akasaka - where this hotel is located. I did not know what to expect, only that the hotel is quite large.Rooms:Adequate size if on the smaller size. Room is well equipped though. Bed, large screen, control panels for lighting, coffee machine, minibar. Typical 4-5 star business hotel. Dining:The corporate rate does include breakfast and there are multiple options. I picked the tower buffer which is on the tower building top floor (40th floor). Good selection, better view, probably best view for any Tokyo hotel breakfast venue. View goes on for miles. Bonus: weather was clear, Mt Fuji was visible in all its glory!Facilities:The hotel has more than 40 (yes - four-oh!) dining venues. It is overwhelming at times, but you can never be short of dining options. Intangibles:The hotel tries to be all things to all people, and you know what - it succeeds! There is a large Japanese garden with waterfalls - very pretty. It has a rooftop rose garden, with red roses in full bloom. I mentioned the variety of dining venues. The large hotel complex has a shopping arcades - selling souvenirs, and general supplies (meds, candies, snacks), and there is a Fami-ma (Family Mart) convenience store. Oh .. and if you have a hankering to shop for a car, the ground floor of the hotel housed a Rolls Royce (yes - Rolls Royce!) dealership. Staff:Really the difference maker of the hotel. Everyone is super polite, and super helpful. I stayed at Conrad, and was pampered - as one expected for a Conrad. But the staff at New Otani is on par. If I come back to Tokyo, New Otani would be at the top of the list, just due to the quality of the staff.Location;Akasaka area. It is about 5-7 min walk to Akasaka-Mitsuke station for easy access to Tokyo Metro. The area around the station was quite lively in the evening. Summary:I have no major complaint here. The bathroom maybe a little dated, and room was not as modern as newer hotel, but staff and other intangibles make up the difference. It is definitely among my top choices for next Tokyo trips.","Auburn, Washington","Robert M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auburn, Washington</strong>",58,4.0

The main, garden tower and Gardencourt I think. We stayed in garden tower. Our building was the oldest and still used actual physical keys instead of key cards. They brought us to Japan times every day. The doors have doorbells which was handy for us because her kids are staying in a different room two doors down. Rooms are not huge but very comfortable. If I had any complaints it was the air-conditioning. It blows out cool moist air, so the air gets cooler but then everything feels sticky. I cleaned her room every day so we always had nice dry sheets to sleep on but I am glad grateful we didn’t need to spend much time in the rooms for that reason of the air conditioning issue. There are tons of stores and restaurants in the building but they are all very expensive with the exception of a convenience store located in the garden court . The location is excellent, The nearest metro stop is literally less than a five minute walk away, the nearest JR rail stop is Yotsuya, a pleasant 10 minute walk away. We had JR rail passes so we used the Yotsuda station every day . Shinjuku station was just a couple of stops away, as was the Tokyo station, and most big trains and other trains all connect those two stations. In the direction of the metro station is an area with lots and lots of restaurants and shops. Very authentic most of them don’t have English menus .

But have to say, my stay there was wonderful all around, and I'd highly recommend this iconic Tokyo hotel to almost anyone.Tokyo is a vast city, and you couldn't ask for a better, more central, location than the New Otani has. The hotel--built in early sixties modern style--is famous for its fabulous, park-like gardens. But it was the room itself that I really loved. A good view is important to me, so I upgraded to a deluxe room (small suite, really), with a fabulous view of Tokyo that made me never want to leave the room. It had a large sitting area and a semi-separate sleeping area, all done in dark, understated colors. It was luxurious without being ostentatious, with one of the best bathrooms I've ever seen in a hotel (with electronic shades that made it possible to see the great view while taking a bath). Though the hotel is very large, the service was impeccable, and one could choose from an infinite number of restaurants to dine in. There's an indoor pool in the health club, a great looking outdoor pool set in the lovely gardens, and even tennis and squash courts. In short, I really loved my stay at this place. If you need a totally minimalist boutique hotel experience this might not be for you, but I felt like I got the same level of service, despite the hotel's size. One thing to note: Whether you stay in the New Otani's Main Building, as I did, or in the Garden Tower next door, be sure to ask for a good view, which in my case meant the gardens and the city beyond.","Boston, Massachusetts","Bequia1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",151,5.0

As the headline says this is a huge hotel. It is in fact two hotels (the main and Garden Tower) and one office complex (Garden Court). They are all interconnected and the signage between them isn't always great so be prepared to get lost - Often. The other confusing issue is that the 4th floor in one building is the 2nd in another. It also seems to exist in some space vortex as you can go through one door and then return back through it into somewhere completely different! Basically it is very confusing. There are circa 40 restaurants and countless shops along with a very large banqueting suite which is very popular for weddings so as you can imagine it can be very busy. I went on a holiday weekend and it was packed. However the hotel copes well with being busy and the staff are excellent. The hotel is nice enough. It is old (original 1964) but has been renovated a few times and in, in general, well equipped and well looked after. I stayed in a standard room on the 7th floor with a view over the rose garden. I suspect it is not the premium view as you could also see various air-con condensers. Room was fairly large. Larger than other hotel rooms I have stayed in in Tokyo. They have an outdoor pool which proved to be very popular. I got there about 10:15 (it opens at 10:00) and it was heaving. They sell club membership so the majority of people were not hotel guests. Despite being busy it was spotlessly clean (most things in Japan are) and the changing rooms first class. There is also a large Japanese Garden you can walk around which is well maintained. However with a number of wedding going on it is popular for photographs. They have a New Otani Club which you can join on arrival for free. This is worthwhile as it gives access to the club room on the 3rd floor as well as late checkout.","Henham, United Kingdom","LondonAVB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Henham, United Kingdom</strong>",18,4.0

The Japanese Garden serves as the backdrop for wedding pictures. There are over 40 Restaurant in the hotel complex and shopping mall, covering the vast range of culinary tastes. The restaurants are relatively expensive, so high quality has its prize, however, there are many eating options at walking distance from the hotel with lower prize range. The shopping mall is a bit of a maze, and it takes a while to get your bearings, which at the same can be pleasant experience to just get a bit lost and browse the many little shops. Apart from the Japanese garden, my favorites are the various rooftop restaurants, which offer fantastic panorama views of Tokyo at day or night. You can enjoy a view of Mount Fuji while having breakfast in the rooftop restaurant of the Garden Tower. For rooms, I recommend to stay in the Main and avoid rooms in the Garden Tower.

If you visit Tokyo in a short time, I recommend this place without hesitation. The western and Japanese menus offered here are excellent and they were delicious throughout the stay.On the 17th floor, there is a restaurant where you can enjoy a spectacular view by turning 360 degrees and enjoyed a dinner buffet here. We had all-you-can-eat teppan-yaki, tempura, and sushi as well as buffet menu with roast beef and fresh ingredients, and it was delicious.Location of hotel is also expensive because Akasaka, Shinjuku, Shibuya, and Tokyo Station are nearby, and taxi of infamous Japan was available freely.It is not easy to explain in words ... The hotel had a wonderful Asian sensibility that was different from the global hotel chain and it was very attractive to me.I highly recommend you use this place.

So we did ... (suckers?).The room was very nice and the hotel was in a convenient location for us as we were catching up with friends. The garden is absolutely lovely. We didn’t eat at the hotel at all, but I snuck up to the revolving restaurant at the top, from where there is a view of Mt Fuji.In the room, the pillows were a bit hard, and the hairdryer was one of those pathetic small ones - something I pay particular attention to :-).

The garden view breakfast area is great - if you join the New Otani hotel club the breakfast buffet is 2,000 yen which is better value than most Tokyo hotels I have stayed in. It has a reasonable selection of western and Japanese breakfast foods. The fitness room in the Main building is kind of lame - a couple of running machines and two weights machines - although they have a nice stretching area. For runners you can do a 2.5 mile loop around the Akasaka Mitsuke palace which starts right opposite the hotel which is great because there are only a few traffic lights. If you take trains it can be a bit of a trek with bags - both stations are about a 10 minute walk from the Main building, although the Akasaka Mitsuke station can be reached by walking along the shopping corridor which links the main building to the other parts of the hotel complex.

However, we learned right away (by almost stubbing our toes) that the bathroom floor was about one and one-half inch higher than the floor in the room. We had to really remember that in the middle of the night if we got up in the dark to use the bathroom. I do not know if it is true on all floors. I think the management should put a reflective tape or something like that at the edges of the bathroom floors.The hotel is in two towers, one 17 stories and the other 40 stories. There are literally dozens of restaurants distributed throughout the facility on several floors. Dozens of expensive shops are also located on these floors. The restaurants are very expensive, even for Tokyo, We were able to find very good food just outside the facility. However, the entire complex is so huge that you need the concierge's help just to get out on the commercial street outside. Part of this property has a beautiful Japanese garden. Several of the restaurants are located in the gardens. It was worthwhile just to walk around the garden as Tokyo recovered from an unusual 8""(20 cm) of snow.We took our breakfasts at the top floor of the 40-story tower.

The service is above and beyond and the only fault I could find was that most of the restaurants closed early. From being the back drop of James Bond You only live twice to the 300 year old traditional gardens it was a truly spectacular experience. If you're looking for that something extra special and a little quirky this is your hotel. Mount Fuji is visible from the 40 th floor breakfast room along with the panoramic view of Tokyo. Or, if you prefer you can have the tranquil view of the gardens from the full wall of glass in the breakfast coffee lounge whilst you dine. As an admirer of retro the original Seiko clock of the world, which takes up a whole wall to the original glass light fittings is a feast for your eyes as you glide effortlessly through the expanse of thickly carpeted areas from the eagerly awaiting doorman through to your comfortably spacious room. All with views of some part of the city. Excellent service, excellent food and my only regret is that I only stayed 2 nights, as wandering through the gardens past the giant koi ponds and the magnificent waterfall, through rust and gold maple and cherry blossom, walking over the lacquered red bridges makes this secret place a very special destination.

It was fantastic to just step outside the door and walk under trees blazing with peak fall color.The hotel was able to grant my request for a garden-view room, and to my surprise, on my first morning there the view also included a spectacular 10-minute glimpse of Mt. Fuji at sunrise. (Don't count on that, though.) The room was well furnished and larger than many I've had in Japan, with an immaculate, spacious bathroom that had high-quality amenities.The staff was uniformly welcoming and helpful. (I gave up trying to sort out a glitch in the awarding of loyalty-program points for my stay, but though that was frustrating, it doesn't detract from my overall appreciation of this kind and professional staff.)Some other reviewers have commented that the hotel's appearance is dated. I found the room decor fine and considered the decor of the public areas pleasantly retro. If you like to start the day with an ample buffet breakfast, I recommend looking at rates both with and without the meal included. At the time I stayed, booking breakfast along with the room was a better value than paying separately for the meal, even when separate payment was at the ""staying guest"" rate. If you don't want the buffet, there are numerous other choices within the hotel, across the street, or a few blocks away.The nearby subway station will get you to (or start you on your way to) anyplace in Tokyo. I used the subway to return to the airport, but if you have a lot of luggage, you can also take the airport limousine bus. Note that it leaves more often (for Haneda at least) from the Prince Hotel across the street than from the New Otani.I was surprised that the hotel seemed to have no green policies. There were no cards in the room that could be used to tell maids that it wasn't necessary to change sheets daily, and it seemed a huge waste of water and energy to replace the terrycloth bathrobe (a nice amenity) and sleep clothes each day.

Bathrooms really make or break a hotel room I think, and this one was very spacious, had lots of spots for storage, a modern shower and bath, good toiletries and looked stunning too. The large king size bed was incredibly comfortable (softer than most we experienced in Japan). Great nights sleep here.The look of the hotel is truly stunning, you can walk from one hotel to the Garden View hotel which is connected and we did this daily. We enjoyed walking through the hotel to look at the stunning decor as well as visiting the gardens. The service staff are very helpful and attentive. There are lots of shops and restaurants inside the hotel which we didn't make too much use of, we did have dinner in The Sky the first night which is highly recommended for the 360 degree views and the delicious food. Aside from that right across the road you have The Terrace with lots of yummy food choices, Akasaka in a 10 min walk with three small streets full of options and Akasaka-Mitsuke station just around the corner (use the underground pass) which takes you pretty much everywhere in Tokyo.

Whilst the Hotel itself is stunning, the room we stayed in (which was the Standard Room with breakfast) probably wasn't worth $450 for 1 night. We stayed in Shinjuku at the beginning of our Holiday and paid half that price for a similar view. In saying that, the bed was much larger and very comfortable, the breakfast was very nice - a lot of choices - and our view at breakfast was quite breathtaking... but I didn't see anything like the pictures on their website (which is probably part and par to the Hotel being so big, we just didn't have a lot of time to go exploring).I didn't realise there was a main building and a garden tower building.

I stayed in four hotels in Japan and this was always the case. The New Otani has comfortable kimonos in addition to bathrobes. One of the conference dinners was in The Sky and seriously, you need to experience it. Only the outer seating area revolves, different than other revolving restaurants I've been in. Lots of shops (high end and convenience stores) on premises. I didn't find the metro too far to walk at all, and nearby that is a vibrant area full of more restaurants than you could count.

Even in a non-smoking room, I smell cigarettes here at the New Otani. My sense is that the air conditioning system is outdated. The hallways are not air conditioned which is quite surprising. It is very unpleasant to step out of the elevator into a muggy hall when you're coping with the hottest days of the year. Furthermore, I was frustrated to learn that the indoor pool has a $30-$50 a day fee. This was not obvious from the website that shows many beautiful photos of the indoor pool.On the plus side, the lobby is quite upscale and the views of the garden are very beautiful.

While the bathroom was very nice and the room size overall was indeed large, the layout was awkward. The bathroom had a step-up which was a bit dangerous at night with the lights out. The closet for luggage storage was difficult to access due to its location right outside the bathroom, and there were not any drawers in the room for clothing storage - necessitating living out of a suitcase. These negatives could have been dealt with for a 3-night stay, but the air conditioning not cooling adequately left me with a bad experience. While management was notified and possibly looked into the matter (they left a typed response), the air conditioning never cooled and each of the 3 nights in the room was unpleasant. As for the restaurants and other features, it was quite disappointing that the pool opening date was July 15th -- very late in the summer, and with the daily temperature at 90 degrees farenheit or hotter, it would have been nice to have used it. The gardens on the property were lovely, but would not be a factor in choosing this hotel over another. The breakfast buffet on the 40th floor was very good, along with the views. Finally, I thought because of the size of the hotel (huge) and extensive number of restaurants (over 30 I think), it would be hard to go wrong, but the hotel size was overwhelming to an exhausted traveler. Also, we joined the New Otani Club thinking we would receive free complimentary newspaper and coffee/tea in the dedicated lounge for members, but were disappointed that it didn't open in the mornings until 10am, a time far too late for travelers or business people.

Just a few stops from Tokyo Station. The neighbouring area of Akasuka has plenty of places to eat in the evenings, so it's definitely worth going out for dinner in the evenings. The in-house restaurants (there is a great variety of them) are a little on the pricey side, so it's worth going out for meals.The room was spacious by Japan standards, but not as much as I was expecting for that price per night. The hotels in Kyoto were better value in that regard.The outdoor pool is only open for a month or two per year, which was a pity. It was the height of summer when we went (early July), but the pool was only opening mid-July, which seemed a bit mad considering the frantically hot weather while we were there.

Our standard king room came in at 388 sq. ft. As we were staying for 8 nights, this was a huge plus as we had room to stretch out and put our belongings.- Incredibly clean, comfortable, and plenty of amenities (mini bar, many bath products, robes, yukata, etc.)The Hotel- The Gardens are absolutely breathtakingly beautiful.

How often are a hotel grounds one of the highlights of your trip?- Go to the Sky Bar. Immediately! Great views of Tokyo, cocktails are a little pricey, but expertly made and worth it. I asked the staff if I could walk around to see all the different views and they encouraged it! - Endless food options and many nice shops inside this massive hotel. We bought a small painting for our house to always remember our wonderful stay.The Staff- Everyone is so incredibly professional, nice, and helpful. They treat you so well and I miss the service already.- Room Service is quick and wonderful if you desire it- Housekeeping does a great job at making it seem like they are not even there, working quickly and efficiently, making your room as tidy as if you just checked in.Convenience- Less than a 3 minute walk to the Ginza, Hanzoman, and Marunouchi subway lines with other lines in reasonable distances as well.- Under a 10 minute walk to the Yotsuya JR station for any JR lines you need.- Airport Limousine stops at this hotel, which is an incredibly cheap and efficient way to get to and from Haneda or Narita.Con'sI really can't say anything negative about the Hotel New Otani.

It seemed isolated from the type of busy area that we like with lots of small restaurants and shops. But once we had figured out the orientation of the two parts of this huge hotel, we discovered that by walking through the connecting lobby, taking another elevator and then a short walk on the main road, we were actually close by subway lines and a street full of restaurants, bars and shops. In the end it turned out to be a quite convenient location.The hotel itself is almost intimidating in its size but has plenty of restaurants and shops on various levels. Our room, a standard twin in The Main, seemed rather dated and old-fashioned and left us thinking it was high time for a makeover. The bathroom was the most dated part of the room, an over-bath shower with a curtain and very cramped space is not really up to date although water pressure was good and the amenities package excellent. The beds were comfortable and extra pillows were provided on request. Sleep quality was good and the room quiet. Complimentary bottled water is limited to two bottles per day although a pitcher of iced water can be provided on request.We didn’t use any of the hotel restaurants as we prefer to search out local cafés and restaurants but the main Garden Lounge seemed popular and busy at all times of the day.

This a place for weddings and special occasions, so the lobby and banquet halls are rather busy. The breakfast buffet was typical international fare and nothing stood out as being ""great"" for the breakfast. There are plenty of high-end shops and restaurants to occupy your time. Subway is not too far away and there is a street full of restaurants about 5 minutes walk away. Tell your wallet everything will be okay, but be prepared to spend some money. Make sure you get a free parking ticket otherwise parking is charged by the hour. There are also a couple of temples/shrines nearby and the Japanese Palace is also close to the hotel.","Seoul, South Korea","Bryan J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong>",39,4.0

To be noted: rooms (even though not so modern) are significantly larger than most in Tokyo, and those overlooking the Japanese garden are lovely. Restaurants feature La Tour d'Argent, quite a funny sister property of the Paris landmark. Overall the hotel is less pricey than what could be expected for the rooms - breakfast though is rather expensive for what it is and i would say no breakfast space feels very cosy (rather more a train station in fact).

This was my first business trip to Tokyo and I had some choices of business hotels that I could pick from my list of corporate hotels. I heard some reviews of some places but decided on this one as it seem to be quite a nice getaway from the hustle and bustle from the busy life in Tokyo city! My opinions on this hotel: Location: This hotel is located near the Akasaka-Mitsuke district that was close to Yoyatsu and Akasaka-Mitsuke. I did not have much time to explore this area and took mostly taxi in and out. I do not think the location is very convenient for a shopper as it was tucked away in a ""mountain"" area. I did notice some shopping area like BIC Camera and Tokyu Plaza nearby but I did not have time to explore this area so I really am not sure how convenient it is to walk down the ""hill"" to reach these shopping venues. The Hotel: top notch! First class! Entering the concierge was a pleasure. It was 5-star hotel like it should be. Every decoration in this hotel was tastefully done. This hotel was actually quite big, it had a main and a garden wing. As it was located on top of a ""hill"" so I guess it makes sense for the hotel to have some shops located in this hotel. The Room: Superb! Cosy! I think as a 5-star hotel, it is a nice hotel not only for business associates but also for dating couples to stay. The room was large and spacious. It had a couch that you could sit/lay down. The bed was king size, huge and cosy. They had this special touch whereby you could choose the pillow you like - Tempur, and several other types. I called for room service to ask for a Tempur pillow. The bathroom was great, if not excellent. It came with a bath tub and also Shiseido amenities for men and women, bath salts, etc. The Shiseido amenities smelled superb! I stayed at room 963 that was at the end of the ""road"" but it was facing a junior suite and I felt safe despite being a solo female traveler. Breakfast: breakfast was served in several locations, but for Otani Club Members, the price was reasonable at estimated 2000 yen. Their buffet spread was the usual standard that every 5-star hotel had and was adequate and tantalizing. Service: excellent. What can I say except that this is truly a 5-star hotel. Sleep quality: excellent! I had quiet, peaceful, tranquil sleep during the 2 nights and undisturbed. The room was cosy and used yellow lights to create a comfortable and tranquil ambience thus making everything feel good. My overall opinion is that this is my home away from home, cosy and comfortable is what makes this stay excellent!","Singapore, Singapore","zftan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",69,4.0

And definitely not worth the 5 stars that it's got. 5 star hotels around the world in major cities like tokyo provide better accommodation and service. - staff is polite and friendly. - room was ok for size. Overall, very clean but the entire hotel has a dark, a bit worn out look. Carpet everywhere (but this is also found in US big hotels) - the bathroom was very, very small (see picture), and definitely not what may be expected in a 5 star hotel. It was impossible to stand in it without touching the toilet, and being in there with two persons at the same time was out of the question. Equipment was clean, functional, but also not very recent. - the hotel restaurants are' ridicilously expensive (and I like to eat well, and not cheap). The buffet (!) restaurants all had a price of 10.000 yen/person (about 100 USD) just for the buffet, and wine started at 7000 yen (70 USD) for very plain local Japanese white wine. Japanese whisky from 20 USD/glass.. Also, the Italian restaurant was very expensive (about four times what you would pay in Europe). We paid about 180 USD/ person in total in both restaurants. For that price, you could almost eat in the three michelin star restaurants in Tokyo. Even the downscale restaurants like the Ribroom or Trader Vic's, or even the swimming pool resto was too expensive. Across the streed there a big office complex just opened (Tokyo garden terrace) with a dozen restaurants (all kinds of cuisine) that offer better quality for half the price. besides the above, there was are also some annoyances in service - we did the rooftop restaurant buffet once. This had an amazing view and setting (and good food, but too expensive, see above). We entered at 8 PM. The waiter mentioned nothing about opening times, got us to the table, brought the aperitives, and then mentioned that the buffet closed at 9 PM, which we didnt know. This was of course very tight, for a multiple course upscale buffet. Moreover, the waiter brought the bill already at 8.45, so that we couldn't really enjoy the good buffet (didn't even get to the main or dessert). This was very disappointing for a 180 USD/person meal. - the hotel advertises the pool, but admission comes with a fee (which I didnt notice at booking). A ridiculous 150 USD for non-hotel guests (we had friends stopping by) and 20 USD for guests. This is also not very ok. If one pays for a 5¨hotel, some services (basic, like a pool) should be at least included. If one became a member of a club (new otani club), the pool was free, but then of course you will receive years of spam. - When checking in, the hotel put a 300.000 yen (3000 usd) block on my credit card, even though the room charges were only half. When checking out, they paid the bill with a (unnecassary) seperate load on the card, so that the total load from the hotel only was 5500 usd on my card, for a bill of 2300 usd.

It's a nice change from the famous western style business hotels in Tokyo. It's conveniently located near imperial gardens and right on the red-line. While the rooms and building may not make you gasp in their modernity, there are several special reasons the New Otani is still a great hotel. 1. Service. The service throughout the hotel is impeccable. Everyone is always respectful and will recognize when you need help and gladly assist. They are at the same time everywhere and no where. They also dress in shifts thru the day- early morning you will find the elevator staff in traditional Japanese style dress, shifting to smart hotel suits with caps in the afternoon. I've seldom experienced such a great staff anywhere else in the world. 2. The Garden. This garden is spectacular. You can see why so many weddings are held here. You can walk thru it at your leisure , or look down into it from the Garden Lounge room- a restaurant point with a 50m glass wall overlooking the garden. There is also a restaurant in the back with views. 3. Restaurant and shops. The main tower and the garden tower are full of various shops and restaurants. Near main tower there is even a shop that sells antique samurai swords! (A bit expensive). But the I think the food- and the number of options, are special. My favorite is the Shabu Shabu restaurant (although I get the sukyaki every time ), but the steakhouse and the teppanaki restaurant in the garden outside are can't miss. Again, excellent service and great food. Despite its age, this hotel still pulls it off, at a better value than most in Tokyo. Will continue as my goto option.

The room's very spacious with king bed, kind of classic and nice city skyline view. The bathroom looked a little tired however, a bit out of place with the rest of the room decoration.We took the limo bus straight from the Narita terminal 2 and arrived in front of the hotel. It was really convenient when traveling with kid and with many baggage. It took less than 90 minutes without major traffic (3-5pm). In Narita terminal 2, there were signs asking us to leave the baggage trolley before we went down to the bus terminal with elevator. It did not make sense and a lady told us to ignore it and we did. No one was complaining, even the guard. We took the same bus from the hotel to Narita airport, so baggage were handled all the way from the hotel room to the airport. This hotel is big, it joins with the garden tower and many dining options. Many Japanese came here for breakfast, brunch and afternoon tea. In the evening, there were also live music and also jazz.The garden is really nice and many huge Koi fish on the pond. They have an outdoor pool but it was closed when were there, maybe only for summer. The usage of the pool is not free I think, because I was offered to sign up for the free membership and that gave me access to the pool and late checkout at 1pm. I am not sure if they offer the membership to everyone or just because I was with the corporate they have deal with. The membership also gave me 30% discount on breakfast buffet and priority check-in / check-out.2 blocks from the hotel, there's a long street with restaurants and mini markets on both sides. Any Japanese foods you can think of, you can find it there. There were many expats hanging out there, so you can find other cuisines like Italian, French and Spanish here too. There is a fugu (blowfish) sashimi restaurant there too. We had okonomiyaki at a specialty restaurant called Botejyu on the second floor, which was really good. If you need to walk to the Yotsuya station, once you descend from the new otani hotel, climb the stairs to your left and it is a much better walk path with trees compared to the road side pedestrian walk.","Sunnyvale, California","Soodye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunnyvale, California</strong>",88,5.0

Some of the rooms have excellent city views - go for a high floor. The beds are comfortable with good linen, and the bathrooms are functional if somewhat basic.The revolving restaurant (17th floor, Main Tower) is well worth it - go early because the buffet shuts down at 9pm sharp (which is a shame - but a feature of this hotel is that it hasn't woken up to international life or the 21st century, and that is also part of its charm). Focus on the tempura bar, the sushi bar and the sweets.Breakfast is a complete shambles.

The location is perfect, the very easy to use, tourist friendly Metro line is a short walk from the hotel to Akasakamitsuke. (As a note for fellow travellers it doesn't really matter where you stay in Tokyo as long as it's close to a Metro station as it's super efficient and safe).The hotel is enormous, a top class international (soulless) hotel. Could have been anywhere in the world, apart from the amazing outside gardens. Everything from the check in to the concierge to the room was as you would expect from a 5 star international hotel. Professional, super efficient. Not very personal. Perfect if you're a business traveller on expenses as the incredible choice of restaurants were very expensive (Tour d'Argent, Trader Vics etc). One of the main reason I booked the hotel though was so my boys could have a swim in the mornings/ early evenings. To be informed the swimming pool is not for Under 18's and with a hefty charge for adults to use the pool to me is scandalous. Every 5 star hotel I have ever stayed in includes fee use of a swimming pool for all ages at no extra cost. The facilities to gain 5 star status is that it has a pool right?? Well not if you're under 18 at the Hotel New Otani.So I leave the hotel feeling I've been misled and disappointed. My rating of average is based on feeling misled and my boys not being able to have a swim. The hotel and its staff would otherwise get a 4 star, very good rating.

This hotel is located at Akasaka area and is 10 minutes away from the nearest Subway. About 200m of the walk from the hotel to the subway is not sheltered, so you will have seek shelter and wait for the rain to stop, as it did rain twice during my stay there. The hotel is famed for its gardens, which were part of an Edo era mansion. This garden was preserved and integrated into the hotel development. It opened in 1962 and hosted its first guests who came for the Tokyo Olympic Games.The hotel is huge with an old wing and new wing. I stayed in the old wing. Room-wise, its spacious. We had 3 single beds, as we went as a family. Room décor-wise, it’s a little dated, with peach colored wallpapers and flowery carpets. However the room is clean and well-maintained. My hotel room has a big window which afforded us a good view of the garden. Just beyond the hotel property is a huge property reserved for the Japanese Imperial family’s use.They have several restaurants, some on the 5th floor, some at the top of the hotel, which overlook the gardens. As it was winter, the leaves were yellow and red and when the winds blew, the leaves were blown off the branches and it was a beautiful sight.Nearby are two long streets that have many eateries so you can pop into for a meal. There is also an electronics store – Best Denki nearby.

Room was very spacious and comfortable.The breakfast was varied - I ate in two different locations during my stay, with both having some similar offerings and some different.The one area of disappointment I found was the exercise facilities. Being unwilling to stump up the large charge for the in-house spa, the 'workout room' was woefully inadequate. In The Main tower it consisted of a treadmill or two, couple of bikes, a cross trainer and some sort of leg machine. There was another in the Garden Tower that I didn't look at, though a friend advised it was equipped much the same. As this was my first time in a hotel in Asia, I don't know if this is the norm, however in Scandinavia where I travel regularly I have had no problem in locating hotels that also provide access to local and very well-equipped gyms (if they don't already have one themself).Service was very good - probably about what I expected, but I was surprised at how visible the service actually was...not sure a hotel in Europe would bother with so many people standing around waiting for something to do!All told, pretty good, but the ability to train well while I'm travelling is rather important to me.

Both stays have been previously reviewed here. This third stay was a mixed bag: the room booked was a Main Deluxe like our last stay, but the room proved less upscale, although there was also a slight difference in price (lower). This would suggest some variability within a given room type, which is consistent with the different web site pictures, yet also makes booking a bit of a random exercise. The Hotel would not accept charging to a Travel Agent's credit card, which is frankly annoying: most hotels in Tokyo accept this (e.g. Cerulean), and the last time it happened to me was with a very modest business hotel in Nagoya, and quite some time ago. Again check-in policy was rather inflexible, a bit difficult to fathom for a Hotel of that size. Otherwise good service throughout, Japanese (high) standards. As stated above, the room was not as upscale as other Deluxe rooms, but still equivalent to a Junior suite in many hotels, with a small seating area and sofa. However, in that configuration it was almost impossible to watch TV whilst lying in bed, a bit unfriendly to the jet lagged traveller. Spacious bathroom, with bathtub as well as shower cubicle, and Shiseido toiletries. Free wi-fi and in-room safe. There are several fitness options, but only one is free and has a very limited choice of weight machines (actually only one leg machine!).

The surrounding trees were so tall that it blocked out all but the highest floors of the other skyscrapers. It was nice to just walk around in there after a long day. It is a place of peace hidden in a city that can be overwhelming to the senses.There is also a nice outdoor pool area next to the garden but it was very busy and we weren't interested in a pool on this trip.There are several restaurants scattered about the different areas. I only ate at two of them: the yakitori place and the tonkatsu place. Both were above averate for being in a hotel and I was able to charge them to my room. I recommend the short walk to Akasaka for food. There has to be 400 restaurants in that small area.There are two different areas for breakfast. If you want an amazing view and less of a selection then the garden view breakfast area is nice. They have a really good selection of bread, fruit, cereal, scrambled eggs with cream, etc. If you do the garden view breakfast then I suggest getting there when they open at 7am so you can get a window seat. I personally prefered the epic breakfast buffet that was near the check in desk and main entrance. It cost ~2,800 yen, but in my opinion it was worth it to have that much variety. They had everything from smoked meats, gourmet cheeses, chinese noodle dishes, eggs over easy, bacon, sausage, fried fish, and everything else you would need to get your day started. Access to the hotel from Narita was simple. We took a train when we arrived, then a short 10 minute cab ride. When we departed we chose to use a shuttle bus that was quite cheap. I want to say around 3,100 yen one way.

I remember reading reviews saying the garden part was very outdated but I guess I didn't realize that's where our new room was until we got there. It was the most outdated hotel room I have ever seen in my life and I was actually terrified I would have to sleep there for 8 days (although the view from the room was gorgeous overlooking the gardens). We quickly called the front desk again and asked to be put back in the main building in our original room with one bed and they once again happily moved us and sent someone right away to bring us to our new room. This room in the main building was much much better! Had a king bed that was very comfy and a very clean bathroom (with the best water pressure of all time).The hotel itself is massive and very close to two different metro stations. It was a very convenient location and we were able to figure out where we were going very easily without knowing a word of Japanese. The wifi was very fast and worked in the room and the lobby! We ate at the yakitori restaurant for dinner one night and it was amazing! We also tried breakfast in the garden lobby one day which was extremely overpriced, a coffee was equivalent to about $9 American money. Luckily there are lots of coffee shops around Tokyo to grab a quick breakfast. Overall we were very happy with this hotel! I would gladly stay here again if my travels ever take me back to Tokyo!

Their cafe at the Garden Tower is very popular not only among the hotel guests but locals too. It overlooks their beautiful Japanese garden. Staff was extremely helpful to answer our inquiry & help us with restaurant bookings. They were so efficient and friendly even prior to our arrival. We were so touched that we brought some shortbread from Fortnum & mason for the Executive Zen team! In-room Japanese breakfast was a must to try. One night we realised the main switch for lots of lights in the room wasnt working. After being informed, they got the problem fixed quickly and left us a letter apologising to us for the inconvenience caused. One evening we got so lost in Ginza and were terribly late for a dinner reservation (we read it's definitely a no-no behaviour in Japan). Tried to call the hotel so they could inform the restaurant accordingly and help us locate the restaurant over the phone. The staff was trying his best to help us though due to a bit of language barrier and our lack of sense of directions in Ginza (trust me, its rather complicated!) , we had a bit of difficult time trying to make our points across both ways. The staff sounded a bit frustrated and guess his tone was a bit strong. We later went to the concierge to thank for their help but the staff on duty didnt seem to understand fully what we were talking about. If even more staff could speak as good English (or close to) as the manager during the day, that would be even more perfect! There are quite a lot of shops inside the hotel (we only had time to check out only a few) but the old bookstore close to the lobby at the main tower caught my eye - I guess it must have been there for ages.

First: hotel is smack dab in the center of Tokyo. From the hotel lobby it is at minimum a 10 min walk to the metro. So not really close by, unfortunately. The entree of the hotel is very large, check-in/out efficient with friendly staff. At peak times there's staff helping with elevators also. Luggage service fine. Coming back from the city i could hand my bag to the staff working on the taxis and it was delivered to the room while I left again. Very pleasant and safe. The room itself was relatively small with oldfashioned furniture. this also applied to the bathroom/shower. Functional abd clean but not very attractive. In that sense the word 'new' can be deleted from the Hotel name. The walls are very thin, connecting doors makes sure one can hear the neighbours without any problem. Hope that your neigbours are of the quiet type and do not play the tv all the time. Also sounds from the hallway come into the room as if the door is not there. That is a serious drawback.The organization of services is impeccable. Limousine bus reservations (to both Haneda and/or Narita airport) are easily made and explanations on visits are exact for example. In the morning there's a free shuttle bus taking you to a few stops in the Asaka business district. You could also walk (20-30 min) but if on business this is a good option.Eating can be pricey. For simpler dishes go to the banquet level: there are several smaller restaurants that serve (especially for lunch) good food at low prices. Dinners typically become much more expensive in Japan. Also, if you want to eat a burger later in the evening (but it closes at 22.00!) go to the coffeeshop connecting the Main with the Garden.Also take some time to walk through the japanese gardens of the hotel. It is pleasant. Nicely lit after dark. Breakfast is excellent but not cheap and if the hotel is booked, make sure to avoid rush hour (07.30-08.30), you may have to wait in line due to groups coming at once.Laundry: not expensive: i had 4 shirts, pressed only, for 2000 yen.

We hadn't asked to check in, and in fact would have been happy to strictly store our bags until the right time. There was no 'Welcome to the New Otani'.

People watching on the weekends is good, as it caters to a large local wedding crowd wearing elegant kimonos. Compared to the Grand Hyatt in Roppongi, the rooms in the Main are slightly bigger, but not nearly as modern. Beds are very comfortable. The view is nice and the garden is nice, but no one walks in the garden in winter. I found the room service food only fair - very limited choice after 9PM. The staff are always helpful and kind. The Golden Spa gym is also a gym for senior citizens, but it's nice and has an excellent sauna and hot tubs. The outdoor pool is great in summer, probably the only reason I'd stay here again.

I first stayed here for 2 nights in 2012 in the Garden Tower in a room on a high level with a terrific view. The room itself was big enough for me as I was travelling alone. It was clean and quiet, nice bathroom, with older style furniture which was in good order and quite adequate. For my second visit to Tokyo I was accompanied by my husband, and decided that we would take a room in the Main building as the standard rooms there were a bit larger and more modern. The room was on the 10th floor, overlooking the front entrance to the hotel. So, no great view, but with an open aspect which was pleasant, especially with all the fairy lights at night lining the driveway. The room was well laid out, with the bathroom and dressing area private from the bedroom area, a separate makeup desk and mirror, small table and two chairs, and study desk. Comfortable bed, quiet and clean - can't ask for much more, and stayed 5 nights. We arrived in mid-morning after an overnight flight, but couldn't check in until 2pm. This is what I like about the Otani - we were then able to have brunch at the cafe overlooking the garden, go for a walk along the lower level shopping arcades, note the various restaurants, and have a very relaxing stroll in the garden. To be able to do all that and not actually leave the hotel when you are rather tired was a bonus.

After walking into its grand lobby and being greeted warmly by the staff, all my worries were silly and unfounded. I was upgraded to an Executive Floor because the month of stay happened to be my birthday month. More than that, service was extraordinary in every sense. Everyone from the Executive Floor Lounge to the doormen were pleasant and helpful. I did not even have to push the elevator button myself as an attendant usually did it remotely for me when he saw I was walking toward one. Wow.The facilities were not dated at all and many parts of the hotel must have been refurbished several times. Everything looked well maintained and in top condition. I love the complete carpeting in all sections and the soft mood lighting along the hallways.The restaurants were superb and I will leave reviews in the restaurants section of TA. Special mention must be made of the stunning 400-year-old garden on the grounds. Waterfall, carps and shrubbery made photos absolutely professional.The location of the hotel was convenient to a few metro stations and for short business trips downtown. It was also near the Imperial Palace and many other attractions.Overall, the New Otani is a true classic that is fabulous value for money and that demands repeat stays.

My favourite was the one on the 40th floor in the Garden Tower block especially when Mt Fuji was clear.Staff are all very professional, helpful & polite.

A popular spot with wedding couples having their photographs taken. Weddings are also held in the hotel. Definitely worth having a stroll around the grounds.Never used the outdoor pool plus there is an indoor pool but costs 5000Y to use???Rooms are generally bigger than most Japanese rooms. Try & request a high room overlooking the garden & facing towards Mt Fuji which is sometimes clear plus when the skyscrapers of Shinjuku are lit up at night the view is very impressive. I didn't use the a/c but there was a constant buzzing sound in my room which did effect my sleep.

With so many restaurant options in the city, we did not utilize any of the other restaurants at the hotel.The hotel's location was perfect - with easy access to the city. A hundred yards to the south were two subway stations with lines that could take you anywhere in the city. Just beyond that is the Aksaka neighborhood with many restaurant options.Needing to buy train tickets for later in the week, I stopped by the concierge to ask which JR station to go to make the purchase. They suggested I use the IACE travel office in the lobby at the hotel. What a find! Linda Pepin, the rep there, was wonderful. She fully explained the different train options, found us the best seats, gave me a map of the train station with my details highlighted, and even called the Airport Limo bus company to book our return to Narita.","los angeles, ca","Wag109</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>los angeles, ca</strong>",18,4.0

Ironically the best (highest) floors are smoking floors, which left me stunned, but then I was reminded most Japanese executives smoke, and their money counts. That's sad, as the best views for getting a potential view of Mt Fuji are going to be the smokers' floors. I took a gamble, and took a smoking room with a view of Mt Fuji - and the room didn't smell. But that could have been luck that the previous occupant didn't smoke either.Tower block has NO views of Mt Fuji and is considered to be on the back, and that may reflect why depending on the seasons, its rates are cheaper than the Main block, so just be aware which part of the hotel you're booking into. My colleagues had the Tower block and it was a huge issue to try and move to the Main block, without a substantial increase in the rate (difference) and availability.Attention to detail, staff friendliness never fades here.

I will stay there again next week, so I was curious and reading the reviews. I have always found this hotel to be clean, reasonably priced, and an oasis in Central Tokyo.The staff are always well organized, and pleasant. The hotel itself is huge, and has many dining and shopping options. The Main (Japanese style rooms) has been recently renovated, and the Tower was undergoing renovation when I was there last year. I always stay in the Tower with a view of the garden, nighttime Shinjiku, and on a clear day Mt Fuji.The best part of the hotel is the location. Within 5 minutes walking, you have access to Akasaka-Mitsuke station on one side, and Yotsuya station on the other. This gives you easy access to the main subway/train lines in Tokyo.The other location feature I wanted to mention is that around Akasaka-Mitsuke station there are many reasonable restaurants.With regard to the ""no free pool"", the outdoor pool is usually open the one week of Golden Week, and then only six weeks during the summer. If you are a member of their ""New Otani Club"", their rewards program, then the pool access is free.

However, there are many great offerings...so much so one wouldn't have to ever leave during their stay (which I no way endorse because the city of Tokyo was such an overwhelmingly stunning locale that I recommend all to experience). I did appreciate that the hotel could provide a proper king bed (because I am tall). And the size of the room and bathroom/shower was also adequate, but less furniture would have made the room feel a bit more spacious.The service was exceptional, even with the obvious language barrier. The front desk even printed maps to provide to our cab driver to help locate a difficult-to-find office location. I also liked the ""make up room"" button that you would press when you were ready for maid service. That is an innovation that more hotels should apply. The staff also assisted with a mailing issue (a post office is also on the grounds).There are an abundance of restaurants (of various cuisines) on the grounds. They are on the pricier side, but having a tropical drink at the Trader Vic's bar was fun and I do recommend enjoying a nice breakfast in the main dining room where one can experience the incredible view of their majestic garden (another high point of the hotel). The happy hour at the 40th floor bar was a good deal for cocktails and the nighttime view of Tokyo is likely unmatched in this neighborhood.The New Otani is a short walk from the Akasaka neighborhood, which offered numerous dining (Ninja was fun w/ tasty food) and nightlife options (Beer Horn and the Mermaid were cozy, but smoky little pubs). I also found the hotel was convenient to several traditional coffee shops near the Akaska-Mitsuke Metro station that I would frequent before beginning my day of sightseeing. There is also an enormous department store nearby (BIC Camera) that sells more products than you can imagine.My most pointed criticism of the New Otani was that the swimming pool wasn't opened during the time of my visit (in mid-July), which I found confusing because the very hot temperatures at the time would seemingly beckon one to visit the hotel pool.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","PrestigeWW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",11,4.0

The room was above expectations, with a small lounge area with sofa, and had been recently refurbished. The hotel is notorious for its common areas: some feel like a giant shopping mall, but the gardens are outstanding for being in the centre of Tokyo. Excellent service throughout the stay, including proper information updates through in-room speakers during an earthquake (magnitude > 6, clearly felt in the room, but not unusual in Tokyo).

Having just come from the Grand Hyatt in Roponggi which was a minimilast boutique, it was nice to come to the Otani which is very traditionally Japanese in order to immerse myself in the Japanese culture. The hotel was built for the 1964 Olympics, and you can tell from the architecture with the domed top which was typical of hotels with revolving restaurants in those days. The ground level is the banquet floor, and the upper level is the busy lobby and front desk, which has a Japanese sculptural arrangement in the front. Uniformed bell people will usher you to the front desk, which quickly checked me in with old fashioned key, and not the plastic cards typical today. A very well dressed female bell person in complete uniform including a cap, just like the Pan Am flight attendants of yore, helped me with my bags and took time to show where everything is in my room. I have never seen female bell people in the US hauling my bags, so this is quite something getting used to. Best of all, no tipping is expected or required! The basic room at the Main Bldg is not the most spacious, but it does afford a view of the garden below. It has a sitting area, a big closet, flat screen TV with CNN, fridge with free water bottles, and a nice bathroom. I still had to get used to stepping up to go-I'm sure many people have tripped not being used to having to step up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. It also had the Japanese toilet with all the bells and whistles-a spout to wash and bidet, controls for water pressure, and the heat of your seat. Why hasn't this caught up in the USA?There is no flat iron in the closet, you'd have to call for one, have them bring it and sign in and out for it in one hour that you're given the time to use it. Some fire regulation, I am told. The first night I had internet connectivity issues which took an hour or so to fix.The breakfast at the main lounge downstairs is nice, you can have American or Japanese or continental. If you have Executive Lounge access (membership or more $) then you can eat there as well. It is on the top floors so the extra food, service and views are worth it. The lobby level below has an arcade of shops for everything else you need-high fashion, jewelry, tours; and it connects to the other building, the Otani Garden Tower, which also has a grocery, mini-mart and the iconic Trader Vic's which has the best smoked steak and other delicious Polynesian favorites and cocktails with umbrellas and birds in sticks.The piece de resistance of this hotel no doubt is the garden. which is a 400 year old Japaneses garden with bridges, koi ponds, lush trees and a waterfall. I wore my Jin Bei (Japanese men kimono) for lots of photo ops in front of the waterfalls.Although a bit dated, you cannot help but love the Grand Dame of Japanese Hotels-it is a gem of history and must remain revered and conserved for all time. It is in the Akasaka area, not far from restaurants, a church, Sophia University and the Yotsuke station which can take you anywhere in Metro Tokyo. They also have a convenient 3100YEN/31USD bus to Narita which was awesome!Thank you, Mr Otani, for building this hotel!","Los Angeles, California","RichieSel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",101,4.0

If you've not been to Tokyo, or not recently, then this could be a very good place for you to ease in. First of all, the room rates here are always reasonable and good value. Most often I usually seem to pay in the range of $150 - $250 USD per night. Very reasonable in Tokyo. The rooms are not spectacular, but certainly functional. Internet service is reliable,which is always a core requirement for me while on business. You might even get a view of Mt. Fuji on a clear day if your room faces it. Furthermore, the hotel is located very centrally with easy access to two different subway lines. The hotel staff is always friendly and helpful with good English language skills. So, what's so special about this place? First of all there's a 600 year old (so they claim) Zen garden on the premises for all to enjoy. The garden includes a waterfall and several restaurants tucked away in there. I always enjoy a daily respite in the garden while I'm staying here. Not the finest garden you'll find in Japan by any stretch, but a relaxing visage at the end of a busy day or over a morning breakfast meeting.And, as a lover of Soba, they have a fabulous Soba restaurant here, Nakajima. The dramatic wooden bar/counter is alone worth coming to see. One giant tree trunk, magnificently preserved.I do not recommend you stay here if you're seeking a quieter, more intimate hotel. To be sure the New Otani is like a small city with probably a dozen restaurants and bars, a small mall between the two wings, and the constant hum of activity of a big hotel. Still, for me it provides everything I need while in Tokyo on business or pleasure.","New York, New York USA","GlobalBizMgr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, New York USA</strong>",28,4.0

The hotel is part of a shopping arcade and offices and was very quiet when were were there. The metro is about a 5 min walk and you can get to travel anywhere. The Imperial Palace is nearby too. There are plenty of good restaurants/bars nearby and would recommend Bums where they do a fantastic steak with garlic mash potato - it's a very trendy busy place, good fun. The area is very safe and I would recommend this hotel for it's convenience. I don't know how much we paid as it was in a package holiday, but I must say when we arrived it was midday, very hot and humid and we had lugged our cases around, and when we checked-in we were told that the swimming pool was out of service (and was for all the duration of our stay) and that was very disappointing as it looked lovely. There is an additional in-door pool but it's at a cost of ab out £30 per person per day and it was an independent business within the hotel complex that has a gym etc. Other than that I would recommend it. Lots of expensive shops in hotel,it has nice gardens with a lovely waterfall.","Willaston, England","lyndatibbs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Willaston, England</strong>",40,4.0

The sprawling hotel comprises a 17 storey so-called Main hotel and a 40 storey Garden Tower separated by nearly 100 metres of corridor. I haven't stayed in the tower for a couple of years, but back then it had large rooms, sparsely furnished, with the hardest beds I've ever experienced. The Main hotel block rooms are far smaller, more recently refurbished, and with beds which help overcome jet lag rather than reduce your chances of sleep. Whichever block you choose, the bathrooms are small - and of course come equipped with the ubiquitous electric lavatory. Press the wrong button and you'll self induce colonic irrigation, and it's worth learning how to turn off the seat warmer.The complex - for that is what it is - is built on the side of a hill. This makes it quite confusing. The lobby floor of the Main hotel is on the equivalent floor to the 6th floor of the Tower (so the Tower lobby is on the 6th floor). There are restaurants and shops all over the place. The hotel is a hive of activity during the day - navigating the wide, shop-lined corridor between the two parts of the hotel is rather like walking down a busy street - yet turns into a wasteland at about 8.30 at night.There are several places to take breakfast. On a sunny day, opting for continental breakfast allows you to eat in the Garden restaurant - half way along the 100 metre corridor separating the Main from the Garden Tower. The huge picture windows overlook a 10 acre Japanese garden, complete with red bridge, rock garden and fairly sizeable waterfall. It looks less polished when you walk round it, but from the breakfast room it is a spectacular oasis of peace over which to gaze while eating your beakfast.We also had breakfast in the more popular, larger, and rather dismal breakfast room in the Main hotel. While the choice is good, the atmosphere is oppressive and the seating arrangements so convoluted that they contrive to create a 10 minute queue for a half empty restaurant at 06.00.Over the last couple of visits I have eaten in a couple of the hotel's Japanese restaurants, including the really excellent Kyubey sushi restaurant. The Sky Bar is a different matter. Service is pitifully slow, the ambience is uninviting (which is why the lights are virtually on ""off""), and the view is completely spoiled by the distraction of the revolving restaurant which circles the bar.For the record, over the years I have found the service in the hotel to be solid if somewhat slow. This time they struggled to cope with the fact that I arrived with my wife rather than just alone as my booking indicated. What should have been a two minute rate adjustment took 15 minutes to resolve. This time round the bed had hairs in it: it happens in hotels; they were very apologetic; but it took two people an inordinate amount of time to remake the bed at 11.00 at night.It's absolutely not a five star experience, but it is reliable and - for Tokyo - reasonably priced for what you get (25,000 Yen per day including breakfast).",United Kingdom,"D j R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United Kingdom</strong>",133,4.0

Hot water isn't regulated resulting in a shower that turns from hot to cold, lack of international plug sockets (typical for hotels in Tokyo) with an additional lack of adapters available, wifi is transcient, breakfast is poor in comparison with other international hotels in major cities. There are better options in Tokyo in this price bracket, e.g. Imperial Hotel. Not much significantly wrong but you notice the small things and as such I would look elsewhere.

I had stayed at New Otani in 2004 and was a bit hesitant to come back since I remembered to property to be a bit dated and spartan, but this is one of the few hotels that are on my company's approved hotels list and my last experience with another approved hotel, Okura, was less than stellar.The lobby and the shopping arcade is exactly as I remembered it from 10 years ago. The public areas are a bit dated, but not in bad shape, and there is a certain classic dignity about the place. The staff is very friendly and there were never any lines. To my pleasant surprise, my room 510 was fairly recently updated. The sleeping area had received an almost Hyatt/Westin-like facelift with stylish gray textiles and dark, sleek furniture. Unfortunately the upgrade did not include the bathroom which felt a bit dated and cramped. The bathroom was very functional, though, and I got my shower taken and teeth brushed just fine. Oddly, a couple of wood surfaces had not received the same dark stain treatment, so the room is not going to win any architectural prizes but was still pretty nice.Regarding the room, my main issue was sleep quality. The bed was nice and there was no noise, but despite my best attempts to seal the curtains against the wall using pillows and chairs, light seeped into the room very early, interrupting my much-deserved sleep. I woke up around 5 both nights and could not go back to sleep (I was past my jet lag already at that point so it was the light). I also could not find a safe, but Japan is probably the only country in the world in addition to Finland where this did not worry me.The gym is small and is equipped mostly with a few pieces of cardio equipment. I did get my treadmill fix, and there was one other person in addition to myself at 6:20 on a Friday morning (I told you I could not sleep).The breakfast room has gorgeous views over the hotel's garden. Unfortunately the breakfast buffet is not top notch. The bread was dry, scrambled eggs tasted funny, and there was not much in terms of oriental breakfast foods.The location is great. Taxis are plentiful. And the staff is super helpful. I also liked the shopping arcade and was able to get some nice souvenir books for my kids from the book store by the lobby.The hotel is clearly past its prime, but in its price point I don't think you can do much better in Tokyo.","San Francisco, California","73_ptr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",46,3.0

I therefore copy my hotel review here (as I wouldn't want anyone to miss it!)This is a huge hotel complex, with numerous places to eat, drink and shop (although, in keeping with other hotel restaurants/bars, they are more expensive than going out). And because of the hotel’s excellent location it is very easy to go out for a drink or meal, as it is a stone’s throw from the Akasaka district (and metro station should you want to go further afield) where there are ample different restaurants to suit all tastes and pockets. To walk to the Akasaka area it is quicker to leave the hotel by the Garden Tower entrance rather than the main entrance as it saves a walk round the block.Our room in the hotel (in the Garden Tower Block) was more spacious than I had expected in a Tokyo hotel, with enough room for storage and suitcases. It was clean, comfortable and well serviced with towels changed every day. The bathroom was also the best we had during a tour in Japan, with a showerhead that could change the direction of jet, bars of soap, small bottles of shampoo and conditioner plus face clothes – all of which were lacking in other hotels we stayed in.Breakfast in the hotel is also good, with a reasonable selection of hot western style dishes, Japanese dishes and fresh fruit. (Although I found this never-varied selection was much the same in other hotels we subsequently visited and consequently became a little boring, but it was probably better here than other hotels we stayed at). Breakfast can be taken at one of several restaurants, but the main two for western breakfasts are the rooftop restaurant in the Garden Tower, and the central ground floor Garden restaurant (there is another Japanese restaurant if you want a Japanese breakfast). These open at 7pm and there is invariably a queue, particularly at the rooftop restaurant where great views over Tokyo can be had from window tables. If you want a window table here for an early breakfast you would need to get there by about 6.45, otherwise just before 7.30 when, although still usually a (shorter) queue, you will get the first arrivals starting to leave. The Garden restaurant is more airy and has a greater capacity, but again you should be there just before 7 for an early breakfast to get a table overlooking the superb gardens. For us, this was the more comfortable and relaxing of the two. (Incidentally, the attractive gardens and pools full of Koi carp are well worth walking round).Drinks are expensive (1000 yen plus for a small beer). The lobby floor Capri bar (near the main lobby) is a bit soulless with more serving staff than customers when we went (I noted 6 attentive serving staff for us and another couple), while Trader Vic’s bar (the only other we tried) was equally pricey but had a better atmosphere being decorated out in a Disney-like South Sea Island style. It also serves snacks in the bar.Overall we thought the hotel very good, reasonably priced for the size and style of hotel it is, and met our needs in all respects, although we did eat and drink out after the first night.","Gravesend, United Kingdom","malabarfly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gravesend, United Kingdom</strong>",576,4.0

The included breakfast overlooking the garden is outstanding, the service first rate, and best of all, you get all this for a very reasonable price!At about $200/night, with breakfast included in my company rate, the New Otani is great value. The 'Akasaka' neighborhood is in the middle of Tokyo, and with the well-connected 'Akasaka-mitsuke' metro station right around the corner, I could get to work or to any of the big tourist destinations in minutes. The Akasaka neighborhood itself is fun, with tons of restaurants, bars, and shopping. In summer, the New Otani's pool opens, making the hotel a popular spot for visitors and locals alike when the weather gets sticky.Transportation Details:The Akasaka-mitsuke 'exit 10D' metro entrance is a 5-minute walk from the New Otani's 'Garden Tower' wing, and more like a 10-minute walk from the 'Main' wing. From the 'Main' wing you walk down the big hallway, past the shops and the restaurant overlooking the hotel's stunning garden, through the Garden Tower's lobby, down the elevator in the connected 'Garden Court' building to the first floor, out the door, to the right, over the bridge, and the metro entrance is on the right. It sounds complicated, but it's easy! We easily purchased 'Pasmo' cards from the vending machine at this metro station, which worked on all metros, trains, and buses in Tokyo. Buying the pass using the machine worked just fine, in English, and we had our passes in minutes. I highly recommend any visitor get a Pasmo (or the equivalent 'Suica' Card sold by Japan Rail) for getting around; it makes Tokyo public transit so easy! The bottom line is that this hotel is comfortable, central, good value, and well connected, making it a great choice for both business and pleasure. So why not bring your spouse along? You'll both have a great time!","Silicon Valley, California","TravelinFieldGuy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silicon Valley, California</strong>",164,5.0

It is very handy to the Akasake-mitsuke metro station. The station is a three minute walk from the Garden Tower exit. Yes it was a fair walk from the Main to the exit at the Garden Tower just allow an extra 5 minutes to catch that train. Easy to find and all in English. There is a street across the road from the station where you will find plenty of little eateries and convenience stores. We caught the limo bus from the airport which delivered us to the front door of the hotel, nice and easy after a fairly long and late flight. Unfortunately the hotel was not able to give us an early check in but were happy to keep our bags until the 2.00pm check in time. You have to pay an extra night if you want early or late checkin check out. It was very busy in the lobby as this hotel is huge and be careful as we decided to have a cup of coffee at a hefty price near the check in at the Main. Go for a walk around the hotel and find other choices. Service and staff were very efficient and friendly. We tried to tip when our bags were brought upstairs and the tip was politely refused as it is not hotel policy. That doesn't happen too often! Beds were lovely and comfortable, room clean, good size and quiet. We did get a key to the room rather than electronic cards which is a little old fashion. We wouldn't hesitate to stay at The New Otani Tokyo again although we didn't catch the cherry blossoms at their best. Not the Otani's fault!!

I especially liked my room in Main which faced the Garden. In the mornings I would have a great view of Mt. Fuji. The hotel amenities in the room were very nice and included shampoo, conditioner, shower cap, toothbrush, soaps, and a few other things. Much more than you get at most hotels. The bathroom was great, with big towels and a robe and the shower worked really well for such a large hotel. The room included a stocked refrigerator (all kinds of soda and alcohol-types) and a drawer that had a hot water pot and tea and coffee. I was grateful for the hot pot because I like a nice cup of tea and since I had brought my own bags of English Breakfast, I was all set. The tea bags in the room tend toward green and other strange herbal flavors. It wasn't easy to get just a cup of coffee in the hotel. There were sufficient outlets for all of my electronic devices and the Internet worked really well. There are lots of restaurants in this huge hotel, but my favorite was the Garden Lounge. It had beautiful views of the Garden and as was really comfortable. I could look out over their formal garden and the waterfall while reading the paper and having a $13 pot of tea. Lunch in the Garden Lounge cost about $35 for a sandwich and coke, but all the food is always beautifully arranged. Breakfast was about the same price. Most of the restaurants were expensive, but it WAS Tokyo after all. I expected that, but it was really too much food late at night. I've included 2 pictures of a menu at the Hotel. I really wanted to eat there, but I have to watch what I eat when on Business Travel. Every morning I would catch a cab to an office building near the Tokyo Tower -- for $17. There was always a lot of cabs available. There was a McDonalds and Starbucks within walking distance. I even got to experience a small earthquake! Also, I walked for miles around the area. It had nice sidewalks, but I think I should have gotten a cab to one of the gardens and then walked. But the fact that it had a nice garden of its own was really special. Not much was blooming in March, but the framework of the garden was easy to see.

Sophia University is right next door and this is the reason we chose the New Otani Tokyo since our daughter is a student there. The airport limo bus from Narita drove us straight to the hotel and the Yotsuya train station and the Akasaka-mitsuke subway station are both nearby. These provided easy access to transportation throughout Tokyo. The concierge desk and the New Otani Club Member desk (join if you're not a member. It's free) answered all our questions about how to get to places.You can walk up to Shinjuku Street (towards Yotsuya Station) and find all the usual big city stores and banks. We especially liked the Mumbai Restaurant for Indian food. The Concierge desk has a map that will get you there. If you head the other way (towards the Akasaka-mitsuke station) you will find even more eateries and city life. This area is great for evening meals and walks.There is so much to do and not enough time to write.It was a little more expensive then what we are used to paying but for this time, since our daughter was going to school next door and we were celebrating our 30th anniversary, it was worth it.We did run into a problem after we checked out and returned home overseas. We had misplaced important papers and we couldn't find them. I e-mailed the hotel and asked them if they could look for them.

There are several reasons for this. First, it is possible to take the Limousine Bus directly from Narita to the door of the hotel. No fuss, no bother. About $30 per person in fall 2013. When you’re tired and grumpy after a long flight, having someone deal with the luggage and getting you there is just very nice. Second, there are always English speaking staff available at the front desk and concierge desk, and most of the staff have some English, so it’s an easy affair to deal with the hotel. Third, the grounds / garden are just terrific, and between this, the surrounding areas, and the pretty fabulous shopping available in the hotel, it’s easy to spend the first day here getting acclimated, work on getting the body clock reset, etc. Fourth, my family and I love the “Western Buffet Breakfast” on the 40th floor of the Garden Tower. It’s easy to get to, and you can find most anything you’d like for breakfast. It’s got a terrific view, there are actually both Japanese and “Western” foods, and most of the guests are Japanese. This is a great way to start the day. And if you’re a member of the New Otani Club (no cost to join, but do so before leaving home so your card gets to you before departure), there are discounts on breakfasts, and indeed free breakfasts with certain kinds of rooms. There is an ATM in the hotel’s lower level Post Office that has English instructions so you can get more cash when you run out, and there really are a plethora of shopping experiences right in the hotel. And don’t be mistaken here; the goods on sale in the shops here are just top rate (albeit with matching prices). The rooms are large by Tokyo standards, and come with nice bathrobes, indoor slippers, bathrooms stocked with every imaginable amenity, Toto Washelet toilets, and the rooms I’ve had always have both a very nice Japanese shower and a tub for soaking. In room WiFi is complimentary. Free daily bottles of water, tea kettle and fully stocked minibar. Helpful, extremely courteous staff. They give the clear impression that if you called down and said you needed a small elephant in your room right away, they would only blandly ask whether it should be Indian or African, and how small. I like it a lot and keep going back. Oh, and there are sort of two hotels here, “The Main” and the “Garden Tower.” I’ve stayed in both, like both, and can’t draw much distinction between them. Let price and availability of the style of room you want be your guide here. Finally, note that the hotel does have a U.S. reservation service with an 800 number listed on their website, where helpful staff in the U.S. are waiting to help you. It’s pricey here, but not the most expensive in Tokyo by a long shot, and that will be your only regret. If you just have to have the most expensive room in Tokyo, look elsewhere. But I doubt you’ll get a better experience. Oh, and there are two subway stations within a five minute walk, with sites such as the Imperial Palace grounds, Tokyo Station, Tokyo Tower, etc. just a very short cab ride away.

I would recommend the grilled seafood which is cooked on a hot plate on your table. The 400 year old Japanese garden on the roof was amazing.

The only drawback was the breakfast at the hotel's restaurant it was a bit over priced for what it was, only a few croissants and some fruit and juice for about $35 USD per person, we decided to take it because we were short on time as we were departing to Kyoto that day, but if you have time , there are plenty of food options outside of the hotel.

It's a large, well maintained hotel complex, that I have been staying at on regular visits since 1990. The rooms are small but loaded with subtly high end fittings. The service is efficient. There is a multitude of very average but expensive restaurants in the complex, as well as better choices in the nearby Akasaka-mitsuke area, which also has a handy subway station on the Ginza line. The service is efficient but very impersonal and rigid. On the negative side, though I have had the habit of staying at the New Otani for over 23 years, and spent my honeymoon in a suite there, there is never any 'welcome back' or acknowledgement of this when I check in. They don't seem to keep a database on clients meaning there is no personal touch. I joined their New Otani Club last year and was unable even to log in to make the reservations this year, despite several interactions with them through email. Being in The Club seemed to make no difference on price or services. The prices are very high in global terms, even for 'special packages' offered at around USD 350 in the off season. It is the only hotel that I've stayed at in the world that does not offer open access to the gym for guests, which is a serious shortcoming that has been going on for decades. I wouldn't expect this to change, given Japanese rigidity. My request for a late check-out, due to a midnight flight, was turned down immediately without any effort to accommodate.Though i have started looking at other hotel options, I may return to the New Otani in future out of habit and for its location, which I'm used to from four years I spent living in the area in the 1990s. But it could be managed so much better and realize a much higher potential.

They could not automatically cancel the key (it was not a card key), and due to security reasons (anybody can use and go up to guest rooms), they asked me to change a room.

I think a group was checking out, but when I got seated I noticed tables were available but that there were not enough staff to clear and rest them quickly. The hotel needs to look at this as two more staff would have made the situation much better. The daimyo's garden and carp ponds around which the hotel is built is a real treat and a retreat from the city's hustle and bustle.

But what I remember most about the New Otani is what a sad, dated hotel complex this is. The ""Main"" Tower was built in 1964 and I LOVE that time period architecturally. I think this place was a stunner back then. It's been selectively updated, but mostly neglected. As in, wildly. This chain isn't very current in Japan, and I don't think they can or really want to bring the hotel back to its former glory. I don't regret staying here, but would NEVER ever do it again.We reserved a room in the ""Main"" part of the hotel... which is the original 17-story tower dating back to 1964 (with three wings spreading from an elevator bank. Very Vegas, pre-Vegas). The exterior has been recently re-clad in new, soundproofed glass (it really works), so from the exterior, the tower looks fresher than it really is. The car entrance/lobby area has been remodeled, too, as have the hallways and elevator banks. The rooms, however, are only semi redone. Ours featured new carpeting and drapes, half new/half old furniture, surprisingly hard mattresses, an old gilded mirrored dressing area and a tiny, FUNKY, circa 80's pink-tiled bathroom with a raised floor that's up 2 inches off the bedroom floor (for drainage, I presume?). Let's just say the room looks WAY better in pictures.When we checked in very late on a Saturday during ""Golden Week""... kind of like Japanese Spring Break... our initial encounter with a front desk clerk was very pleasant and he was really nice and formal in that wonderful Japanese way. However, when we came down to switch rooms for a better view (turns out we couldn't that night), the next clerk was a total jerk (I would have got his name, but I was too tired... he did wear glasses). He really didn't want to help us until the original clerk came over to see what was up. I wasn't expecting that in Japan. And quite frankly, it was the only time during our whole stay we encountered anyone even vaguely rude. The best part of Japan is how considerate and polite people are when you deal with them. (I wouldn't want to live there because of how regimented it is, but it's great for a visit).Thought we booked a deluxe room, we settled for a downgrade (unbeknownst to us) to a ""standard"" room that we actually liked a lot better. It was the width of two rooms with floor to glass windows. Stunning, really. Best part of the hotel by far. Most rooms are single width in a typical railroad car design. We spent a lot of time having cocktails while admiring the view of Shinjuku.We went to great lengths to get that view (turns out it's the one they feature in their ads and website). We originally asked for a Japanese Garden view... we didn't get one anyway. Not many of the hotel rooms look out on Shinjuku, but the higher ones in the wing facing the parking lot and car entrance do. A parking lot view sounds bad, but go for it. You'll get a really nice park/Shinjuku skyline/sunset vista. I could see even see Mount Fuji when I squeezed against one wall and pushed my face to the glass (I obviously didn't see it a lot as a result). Still, it was all covered in snow and quite beautiful.The main problem with our stay was the ""Main"" hotel is connected to its ""newer"" tower, dubbed the ""Garden Tower"" for no reason. It is beyond dated. (It's listed on TA as a separate hotel. It's a separate world, full of bus tour guests). There's NO excuse for not remodeling it since 1983. Seriously, it hasn't been touched in 30 years. (Or, if it has, they've only done little tweaks that make it look sadder and cheaper). The shopping ""mall"" that connects the two is really antiquated, too... with horrible sparkly $20 T-shirt shops and oddly pricey jewelry stores, manned by the original owners from 1964. They look really tired, as does the mall. You just cannot believe how ugly the carpeting between the towers is. And the light fixtures. And the weird stucco arches. And the weird green granite seating areas along the corridor. The main restaurant overlooking the Japanese garden features a bright burgundy and, again, green decor. It is just so unbelievably depressing to walk past it every day. It's like you're stuck in a really ugly time warp.The exterior around the garden is falling apart. The garden itself is pretty and well-maintained, but once you've taken a walk through it, you're done. The fitness center is a joke. Tiny. No weights. The business center next door, however, has free internet connection on PCs. The very nice women running it will charge you about 40 cents to print your boarding pass, however.This hotel, courtesy of its large ballroom, meeting spaces and vast parking lot, still gets a lot of high-end events. It's oddly fun to watch the huge entrance in action when there's a big shindig going on. It reminded me of the Beverly Hilton in BH.The New Otani was built as a city unto itself right before the Tokyo Olympics in '64... so it's not close to ANYTHING new, charming or interesting. If you venture from the hotel to the subway, though the Akasake-Mitsuke station is closer, it's in a less appealing area (though by no means even remotely dangerous). I'd recommend heading north to Yotsuya station instead. It's on the same line, it's a nicer stroll and in a way better-looking residential/commercial area. There is a good McDonald's and Starbucks right by the Akasake-Mitsuke station, however, which is where we had breakfast every day. Wifi at the hotel was free in the lobby. Less convenient than in the room, but nevertheless, free. Just ask for the ID and password at the front desk. We never bothered with the restaurants or bars in the hotel, or with room service. They were pricey and honestly, I'm not sure what the quality would be. There is a Tour D'Argent (the only branch outside Paris) in the mall... a sign of the hotel's original status, no doubt. However, I'm not sure why you'd want to eat there.Ultimately, this is just an old workhorse hotel that's been paid off forever and is too big to make really good. I suppose they're trying, but it's too little and much too late. Our experience wasn't bad as much as depressing. The rest of Tokyo is so bright and shiny and incredibly up-to-date, we were bummed about our choice of hotel here.","Santa Monica, California","andrew-s-wood</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Monica, California</strong>",569,3.0

We went to investigate (he was kind enough to let us go and see what we thought) and the room was spotless and smelled great. Instead of two beds, we now had three. One single and two doubles. We also had an incredible view and a very useful desk (which my husband, who really was in Tokyo for work, was grateful for! The kids and I were tagging along).

With lots of competition in Tokyo, the New Otani especially excels at service. From the fabulous welcome on arrival, to very present management and helpful staff in all of the public areas, the New Otani is an easy place for newbies to Japan from which to explore. No matter what you need, want to know more about - in English or Japanese - New Otani staff go all out to help you. The main hotel restaurant has some Western style food - and despite our initial sticker shock at menu prices is a relatively good deal compared to other restaurants in Tokyo.

We wanted adjoining, and smoke free rooms were a must. The location is great, I am not really sure about some of the comments saying it is ""not convenient"". I am sure the definition is fairly subjective, but the subway is about a 5 minute walk, and to the JR line is about 10 mins - you are not going to find too much better, or if you do, you are certainly going to pay. Some recommendaitons are: to have better work out facilities (and not at the $40 USD charge (I did not use, I chose to run outside instead), and to have more ""English"" channels.

You shoud pay over 300 Euros per night and you are still to pay for breakfast and internet as extra charges!. 2-Some debit and credit cards like Maestro is not accepted!. So at the check in , I am surprized and rather disappointed when I am asked to give two times of total price of my stay as cash for deposit!. And it was 7 millition Yen! due to a miscalculation of the reception desk!. 3-Poor english speaking ability of the staff is another disadvantage of the hotel. I asked for the internet in the room and at the lobby and I am told that it is only by payment and is not free, while after few days I noted that it is free at the lobby and I got user name and password from another guest.4-Compared to other hotels in the world, the breakfast has very limited food variety and if you join the New Otani club you will get about 5US$ discount and it is still >17 US$!.

At it's best, this is an exceptionally good hotel; at worst, the experience is average.For a recent visit to Tokyo, I stayed at the New Otani for the first time in several years. Prior to that previous visit, I had occasion to stay at the New Otani perhaps 30 times over a 20 year period. Most previous stays were during business trips, but this last came at the end of a long trip of a personal nature. In most previous stays, I made very specific instructions regarding my rooms, but on this trip the booking was made with a view to obtaining a good room rate. The result, predictably, was a twin room on a lower floor of the garden tower that was in serious need of updating. Rooms in the garden tower can be a bit cramped, and this feeling is magnified by the layout of the twin rooms. Also, rooms between the 21st and 27th floors tend to leave one spending a great deal of time waiting for elevators, especially in the morning when there is a rush of people trying to get to the restaurant on the top floor for breakfast.My stay this time was adversely affected by a couple of other factors. First, it was the beginning of Spring Break in Japan, and the hotel was quite crowded. Second, the hotel management had decided that this would be a good time to rebuild some of the elevators. On the morning I checked out, it took over 30 minutes before I could get an elevator from the 22nd floor, by which time a small crowd of guests piled into an elevator going up, so we would at least be part of the pack in the lift going down.All this said, there is still much to recommend about the New Otani Tokyo. It is an enormous hotel with rooms in the Main and in the Garden Tower. There is a long concourse connecting the two and each has its own reception. It does take a few minutes to walk from one end to the other. There are a large number of shops, bars and restaurants in the New Otani complex, and the Garden Tower end is only a few minutes walk from the Akasaka entertainment district. The nearby Akasaka Mitsuke subway station is served by 4 or 5 of Tokyo's subway lines, and it is a 1500 or 1600 yen taxi ride from Tokyo Station for those who do not want to drag their bags onto the subway. In short, few hotels are better located, whether for business or pleasure.Service at the New Otani is impeccable. I will give it 4 out of 5 for the current visit only because of the situation with the elevators. The staff are about as well trained as they come. An example: a few years ago, I stayed at the Four Seasons Shanghai; by the time I reached the reception counter at check in, the woman at the counter had my registration sheet ready, and greeted me by name with a smile and a bow. It turns out she had previously worked at the New Otani and remembered me.The breakfast buffet in the Tower Restaurant and in the Garden Buffet were always as good as they come. I did not avail myself of it this time, in part because the cost of the buffet was not included in my room rate and it is rather pricey. Still, on walking by the Garden Restaurant in the morning, it appeared that the spread has lost none of its excellence.Internet is free, but rooms in the tower only allow access by LAN cable which is a problem if your computer does not take a LAN cable (such as the MacAir). Wifi is available in the lobby.I will happily stay at the New Otani on future visits, but I will remember to be more specific about the room requirements.","Vancouver, Canada","WDTVancouver_Canada</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",72,3.0

I was quite impressed with the hotel staff, all were extremely helpful for check in and whenever I needed assistance. The location was very convenient to the Asakasa area and the Tokyo subway system, which was just a couple of minutes outside the doors of the New Otani Garden Tower. Even though I wasn't footing the bill, the cost of all of the restaurants and bars was so high, even by Tokyo standards, that I didn't eat or drink there once. I was also very disappointed in the ""gym"" available in either the Main or the Garden Tower. For a huge hotel catering to many business travelers, you would think they could invest a few dollars on a decent selection of equipment. I've seen better facilities at very modest hotels in the U.S. At least there are some decent running routes nearby. Overall, a nice hotel but I may not return due to the expense of the hotel restaurants and the lack of exercise facilities.","Ashburn, Virginia","MattC56</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ashburn, Virginia</strong>",10,4.0

Ok if someone else is paying. You may feel a bit let down if you're on a personal trip.Summary: This is a huge, sprawling hotel, almost Soviet-Style in size, though not in opulence. You could get lost trying to negotiate the various entrances and exits. The rooms are fairly dated but perfectly adequate. And you will get your first experience of the legendary Japanese toilets (!). But it is well situated with easy access to the Tokyo subway system. The service is impeccable and everything you've heard about. No major gripes so a safe bet.Top tip - for a reasonable noodle meal, try the noodle restaurant in the hotel. The average price is about Y1000-2000. This is near the elevators in the Tower wing. Also, if you want to blow your budget I would highly recommend the buffet in the Sky View (revolving restaurant) where the food comes to you, in time! I paid for breakfast on one day, and it was pretty poor, so best avoided.There is a plethora of restaurants but all of them very expensive (but then, what isn't in Tokyo?).",UK,"slagathor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>UK</strong>",27,4.0

Having arrived in Tokyo, I only just realised they never came back to me so I was sweating over a) did I have a room and b) were they going to charge me for the extra night (as I now needed Saturday to Monday). In typical Japanese fashion, they said it was no problem and just amended my booking on the day. That to me already out the guys on a level above as service to me is key!The room I was given was on 13th floor (1392) and its as far away from the lifts as you get. I deliberately requested this plus a high floor in advance and again they delivered; very happy. The ro itself was spacious with a decent sized cupboard for luggage/ clothes storage, a nice desk, a nice single seat sofa and a very large Panasonic plasma TV. And i had a nice view ofthe roof garden belie. The room was nicely decorated in neutral browns and greys so inoffensive but calming. The only weird thing was the bathroom. Now this was very old and in a very typical pod style ie pre-fabricated and stuffed in without much consideration for surrounding decor! I didn't manage to check out the gym or the restaurants but I can assume they would have all been to a very reasonable standard. Within close proximity are a number of metro lines makes this a very convenient location, especially for the price.

The reception, lobby and restaurant areas are appropriate for an upscale hotel, although as a first time visitor to Japan i was somewhat surprised by the cost of food and drink (even after reading other reviews) that is way above Four Seasons pricing in US for half size portions. Get out of the hotel and into the city, but suggest you have a basic phrase book at hand, otherwise prepare to point and gesture.The Japanese gardens with coy carp fish ponds are sensational, so well worth a wander after arrival from a 14 hour flight to relax in a city oasis. Took a look at the pool but decided it wasn't worth the fee.Location wise the hotel gives you great access to the entire city, but beware that taxi's are also very expensive so plan an itinerary in advance to avoid jumping around the city or perhaps venture into the subway.With my wife and daughter accompanying me, we decided to take a triple room in the Garden Tower. This provided the equivalent of a compact junior suite in US that allowed space for luggage, a sofa and a separate sleeping area which was beneficial as i suffer with jet-lag so I didn't disturb the family while watching the olympics at 2am.The room decor is dated, but clean, with a very slight hint/aroma of smoke (according to my wife, who once moved room four times in New York due to smoke, this time we didn't move). The AC in the room was ok, but in the hotel itself it was non-existent with corridors feeling like saunas. For any workout warriors, head to the main building on level 3 for a much better fitness room than the room in the Tower (no charge at both) or do the smart thing by running from the hotel for a circuit (approx. 7Km) of the Imperial Palace gardens before breakfast. Enjoyed our breakfast buffet on the 40th floor but at over $100, it was a one-time visit in a 3 day stay.Free wifi in the lobby or wired in the room (not very good for an iPad). Suggest you grab snacks and drinks in the shops in the tiny mall network underneath the property or head into the adjoining business tower called Garden Court where restaurant prices are about 50% the cost of the hotel equivalent and excellent.With a refresh on the rooms, i would have scored this hotel a four and would consider staying again depending on price available at the time.","Houston, Texas","TexasMcK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",9,3.0

This report is a summary of our experiences during all three stays. The hotel is located relatively close the Akasake-Mitsuke metro station and hence easily accessible by public transport. Just bear in mind that it is quite a walk from the metro station platform to the hotel reception, partly due to the size of the station, but also due to the sheer size of the hotel. If you have a lot of luggage to carry, you are probably better off catching a taxi to drive you to the hotel main entrance. A taxi ride from Tokyo Station to the hotel is about $20.The first time we used the New Otani, we opted to go for the least expensive room, in the Garden Tower. That room was sufficiently large, definitely to Tokyo standards, but we were nonetheless a bit disappointed by the fact that it looked quite old fashioned. Obviously this type of room had not been renovated for the past 30 years. On the second night of that first stay, we were rudely kept awake by very noisy neighbours. By 3 am, there was still too much noise, so we called the front desk. An attendant was sent up and this guy obviously heard all the noises coming from the neighbours room right into ours and into the corridor. But he did not do anything about it. I suppose it has something do with Japanese etiquette. However, we had paid for a good night's sleep and decided to take matters into our own hands. A couple of solid knocks on the wall and a hard-to-ignore ""SHUT UP"" quietened things down. The following morning we complained to the front desk manager about what happened during the night. In genuine Japanese style we got a thousands bows and as many apologies, but again, nothing was done to ensure that the subsequent nights would be quiet ones. Only after I got really upset -- something that is unheard of in Japanese etiquette -- did things start to move. We were offered an upgrade to a DeLuxe Room in the Main Building with the guarantee that that room would definitely be a quiet one. The rooms in the Main Building are in an entirely different league than the ones in the Garden Tower. They are as large, if not larger, and are very tastefully designed in Japanese style. It is like stepping from a 1980s Holiday Inn into a contemporary luxury hotel. The subsequent nights in the hotel were absolutely quiet. Our advice is to definitely book a room in the Main Building and forget about the Garden Tower. During our second and third stay at the New Otani Hotel, we automatically booked a room in the Main Building without ever looking back. All the amenities are provided: slippers, bath robe and toiletries.The hotel itself is very large and sits in beautiful grounds. The Japanese style garden is worth visiting, even if you do not stay at the hotel. There is a myriad of restaurants in the hotel, but we actually tried none of those. They are expensive -- overpriced in our opinion -- and with so many fantastic eateries in the back streets of Sotoboro-Dori (a very short walk from the hotel) it only seemed logical we tried those instead.The staff are extremely polite, as can be expected in Japan, and master a certain amount of basic English. Most of the staff speak about just enough English to keep things running smoothly. The moment you want to engage in a conversation that extends beyond their hotel vocabulary, things get a bit more tricky. Check-in went smoothly on all three occasions. There were no queues at the front desk and the attendants were courteous and considerate. Interestingly, it is surprising that in a high-tech country like Japan, the hotel still uses regular locks and keys for their rooms, instead of key cards. I cannot remember the last time I saw this in a major hotel. As can be expected from a big luxury hotel, they had no issues with keeping our luggage for two days while we were off to Kyoto. Check-out was just as smooth as check-in. Our luggage was brought to the hotel entrance were a taxi was waiting to bring us to Tokyo Station.One thing that is a bit annoying about this hotel is its size. Its back entrance is closest to the Akasaka-Mitsuke metro station. From that back entrance you have to take an elevator to the fifth floor of that building from where you can walk to the Garden Tower reception desk. If you stay in the Main Building (which we recommend) it is another decent walk along one of the restaurants and a number of shops before you reach the Main Building reception area. There you can take the elevator to your room. It reminded us a bit of the casino hotels you find in Las Vegas where you have to walk for miles until you get from your room to the street. The plus side of this all is of course that the rooms are isolated from the urban jungle and there is no street noise at all. If you want to be in the middle of the Tokyo buzz, the districts of Shibuya and Shinjuku are only a short metro ride away.If you are staying in Tokyo, you can do a lot worse than the New Otani. Of course there are the high-end hotels like the Peninsula and the Grand Hyatt, but their room prices are nearly double of what we paid at the New Otani. Value for money, the New Otani is excellent. The Main Building rooms are great and the location is wonderful -- centrally located, but away from the city noises. The size of the hotel is perhaps a bit overwhelming and the impeccable yet sterile service from the staff might be off-putting for some.",Belgium,"USATravellerBelgium</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Belgium</strong>",64,4.0

Breakfast is possible in three locations, including the tower building on the 40th floor, and you get a fabulous view of Tokyo. The restaurant overlooking the garden is nice, with a view over a nice garden. It has more choice than the tower, including somebody who cooks eggs and stuff. There is also a restaurant close to the reception, this has the widest selection. There is a french restaurant, I *believe* it may have a Michelin, personally I've not eaten there, but I know somebody who has and apparently it's good. Personally, I want to eat Japanese food when in Japan. There is a sushi restaurant that is known as one of the best in the city. It is expensive, but it is very, very good. If you need a more western food fix, check out Trader Joes, which is at the bottom of the tower end of the restaurant. It's pretty good. BTW, you can also walk outside to Tony Romas, which is about a 1km walk. in the neighborhood, around Akasaka Mitsuke, which is the main subway station, there are some nice places to eat. But note it is quieter over the weekend, this is more of an after work area. If you know you are going to stay here a few times, or use the New Otani chain, sign up for the New Otani club, it's not so obvious if you are not a Japanese reader, but it can give benefits like free breakfast and so on.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Adriang68</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",70,5.0

The New Otani is conveniently situated in Tokyo's Akasaka district, and is a 5 minute walk from Akasaka Mitsuke Station and 10 minutes from the JR Yotsuya Station. In the past, the hotel would've been considered 5-star, but time and competition have relegated it to 4-star status at best. Not for the service, which is as terrific as ever, but the rooms, at least the ones in the (Garden Court) Tower. Rooms in the Tower are older, smaller and showing their age - for one, internet is still via LAN (no WiFi), not to mention that power ports are very minimal in the rooms. Even worse, the port is behind the desk and is very hard to reach (I had to physically move the table and crawl under to plug my laptop into the wall.)While the rooms in the Main building are nicer, they are priced much higher. Therefore, you have a choice of staying at a so-so room at a competitive price, or a nicer room but at a price that's at least 50% more. For the price of a room in the Main building, travelers will have other choices in the area, most notably the ANA InterContinental.For me, the Tower rooms do the job since they're a great value, and I just make sure to bring a power strip so that I can plug all of my gadgets during my stay.

This hotel is located in Akasaka near the Akasaka Mitsuke station. It is one of the older style all encompassing luxury hotels, and so it is a huge complex of two hotel towers with many shops and restaurants and other services (even babysitting), so it is easy to just stay within the hotel the whole time. However, this can be quite expensive, as most of these shops are high-end. The hotel is situated on a beautiful, 400 year old Japanese Garden that is really worth a long visit. The rooms in the upper floors have very nice views of the city or the garden or both. The neighborhood is mostly office buildings, and from what I could tell, not very exciting for exploring.The service is very good, as with most hotels in Japan, and they will try to help you in any way they can. I did run into some attitude from one staff member, and I think it had to do with being a foreigner. Most of the hotel staff can speak only rudimentary English, so be prepared. My room was in the Garden Tower. Two things about the rooms really surprised me (in a positive way). First, the rooms are absolutely immaculate, and probably the cleanest I have ever experienced. They are cleaned thoroughly each day. True, the decor in the Garden Tower may seem a little outdated, but I didn't find it to be shabby, and the cleanliness of room made up for it. Second, the rooms are incredibly quiet. I think the hotel was quite busy with numerous guests coming and going during my stay, many as large groups for business events, but I never heard any noise from neighbors or people in the halls at all when I was in my room. It was by far the quietest hotel I've ever experienced.The space in the room is small for western standards but it's laid out very efficiently, and if you are short it's not so much of an issue. The bed is hard and low--which is great if you like hard beds, but for those who prefer big high fluffy beds this may not be your thing.The restaurants in the hotel tend to be very expensive and on the posh side. The sushi restaurant Kyubey has a renowned sushi chef, supposedly one of the best in Tokyo and Japan. There are also a few restaurants that are quicker and somewhat cheaper, but you have to find them. I found that the hotel website was the best place to determine where to eat, as they have the menus and also maps that show the location of each of the restaurants (which is helpful because it is easy to get lost in the hotel).If being stuck in a hotel complex (even a large one) all day is not your thing, and you are up for exploring other neighborhoods of Tokyo by subway, then it is very close to the subway station (Akasaka-Mitsuke). There is a shortcut through the hotel (via the Garden Court entrance) so the walk is not far. Also based on previous reviews, I signed up to be a New Otani Club member before I left. Since I did this only a week before my trip, my card did not get mailed to me at my home in time. However, I found that they had it at the desk when I checked in. There are some perks to being a NOC member, (like a free newspaper, some free services like laundry, and some discounts at the restaurants), and signing up is free, so it is helpful to become a member.Some things to note:-There is no wifi in the rooms. Based on some previous reviews, I brought an internet cable along, but I didn't need it in the end one was provided in the room). Internet use induces a charge to the room (not cheap).-The toiletries do not include lotion unlike most western hotels.-Also, there is no iron and ironing board in the room (in case you were planning on ironing your clothes!).-There's an exercise room in each tower, but it is small (for the machines, only one treadmill, two ellipticals, and two bicycles. For some inexplicable reason, there are also chairs and stools).","Boston, Massachusetts","tesseract68</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",33,4.0

However, the room was noticeably and tastefully refreshed (except for the bathroom) and was comfortable, if just a bit too small for two with luggage. The walls were thin, but I only knew that when I heard our neighbor cough and it sounded like he was in our room. Fortunately the staff did a good job of keeping some rooms empty around us, so it wasn't a problem. The bed was just a bit too hard for my taste, even for a Japanese style. Great bath products, and a hot shower with great pressure.We had a very good breakfast in one of their restaurants, and though it was expensive, it was excellent and kept us going until dinner.

Now Im in Tokyo again and decided to stay there again. What a bad idea...I did my reservation through hotels.com for 3 non-smoking rooms (2 adults, 1 children - 10 years old). They tried to put me into two single bed rooms. I asked where the children were going to sleep and they tried to charge me for extra beds. I didn't accept this and than they moved me to triple rooms - one of them with a horrible smell of cigaret. Tried to complain again but they said it was the only room available.Next day in the morning wake up, drank my pre-workout supplement and went to the ""gym"" or ""fitness center"". Well... they SAY its a fitness center, but believe, it's not. They have a couple of treadmills and elipltical and that's it. No weight lifting equipment at all. Went to other one on the next building and it was the same thing.We are almost in 2012! Every 3-star hotel have at least a decent fitness center! New Otani Tokyo was suposed to be a 4/5-stars hotel!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They have a thing on the 3d floor of the garden tower called ""GOLDEN SPA"" where you can pay around 80 dolars PER USE and it looks like they have a better gym. I guess I'll never know because I asked to make a quick tour to see what kind of weight lifting equipments they have and they said I could not make a tour. What????? Im not paying 80 dollars without seeing the gym! And come one, is this the world most expensive gym or what? Regarding the rooms in the garden tower, they look like they hadn't change since the 90's.Believe me, I'll never come back here again.

The connection to both international airports (Narita and Haneda) via airport busses is excellent (approximately 1 hour transfer time coming from Narita and going to Haneda), and the check in service was efficient, friendly and accomodating. The hotel is vast, and it pays to ensure that one is booking a room in the main tower of the complex: the rooms are freshly renovated, well appointed and nicely furnished (stayed in a deluxe king room). The value for money is quite good - if one chooses to become a New Otanic Club member; this is due to the fact, that NOC members not only receive substantial discount offers (in this case: 50% reduction), but also collect NOC points, which can be used in the hotels restaurants and for hotel services etc. The level of service at New Otani is very good - with friendly personnel and high quality of English spoken by almost all staff encountered. The choice of eateries and top restaurants is more than sufficient, but of course most high quality establishments come at a price (like ""Tour d'Argent"" etc). The room service is of high quality and equally high service standards are offered (very quick delivery and friendly staff) - again, this does come at a price, as it is to be expected from a 5 star hotel in Tokyo. The only real drawback is the breakfast choice: I took breakfast in the garden restaurant, which offers a fabulous view onto the Japanese garden (which is a really nice and unique feature). Unfortunately, the breakfast choices do not live up to the standard of a luxury hotel: the buffet does not even offer warm food choices, and only the most basic bakery and some small chees items. The breakfast service offers such a stark negative contrast to the prevailing quality and service level at New Otani that I find it best to advice guests to forego this offer. Otherwise, a predominantly positive experience might be tainted by an unfortunately negative impression at the start of your day.

Just a big decent from big expectations. A lot has been refurnished and updated, since it's an old antique-ish hotel. But at times it still felt as if I was time-traveling into the 1980's when around some cheesy golden railings, or the empty depressing shops on the B1 floor. However, the room was very clean, ample space, gorgeous view and windows, remodeled room, but the bathroom was definitely reminiscent of the early nineties or an average Tokyo business hotel. Dined at the Belle Vue Italian ""fine"" restaurant on the 40th floor of the Garden Tower. It was a nice restaurant, not many spoke Japanese on staff, the foods had Japanese twists to them like the: Gnocchi made from さつまいも (Japanese sweet potato). But surprisingly it was the best caprese salad I ever had. The wine list is very pricey for so-so to shouldn't-be-that-expensive wines. The 110g Japanese Filet was 8,900 円... but a delicacy. The bar next foor has a spectacular view of the Tokyo Tower and you can have a nice glass of Hibiki Whiskey while gazing at the skyscraper stars and smoke a nice Cuban. All in all, the Hotel New Otani has a legendary reputation as a classic hotel here in Japan. Unfortunately, this old fame with a new facade is what they're trying to cling on to. I've experienced much better valet, front desk, and and all hotel service at other establishments from Shinjuku to Ginza. I just wasn't blown away.But why not give it s shot. It is indeed a nice place.By the way, if you're a fan of true modern and sleek, please look elsewhere!",,thedeetraveler,1,3.0

Both rooms were good, small as you come to expect in Japan but if you unpacked your cases into the drawers and wardrobe so you didn't need to keep going in and out of your bags it was fine.The rooms are clean, modern finishings and well appointed with everything we needed - had the usual hilarious toilet / bidet combinations with heated seats and heaps of buttons. Staff are friendly with good English and very helpful.The subway is close, we used Akasaka Mitsuke station just across the bridge but there are others nearby, we simply found it easier to keep using the one, you get a subway map at the front desk or subway stations and it is really easy to find your way around even changing lines. Once we found we'd got on the right line going the wrong way but no problem, got off next stop switched sides of the platform and got on the right train maybe two minutes later.If you head the same direction as the subway from the hotel there are loads of restaurants here - and although I love Japanese food, at breakfast I can only handle a cuppa and pastry or toast so there is a Starbucks there too. Near the entry to the subway is a 7/11 for anything else you need and there always seems to be a vending machine handy to grab a bottle of drink (you can use your PASMO subway card on a lot of vending machines).Internet is available in the room at extra cost, if you do much online we found it cheaper to buy either the 24 hour period or one week than pay by the minute.The airport limousine bus comes right to the hotel and as we travelled late we found that the easiest way to and from the airport at similar cost to train and less dragging our bags.We got a good price on Expedia considering it was cherry blossom time, very popular for tourists, think it was about A$220 a night.We are staying here again in winter 2011 when we visit (got an even better price) and would definitely recommend it to friends. It is worth joining their club, it's free and we got free late checkout which was great as we had a late flight and other little bonuses.","Brisbane, Australia","2AussieTravellers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",37,4.0

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and I found their English to be quite efficient (certainly better than my Japanese!). I was especially pleased with the concierge desk. The ladies that staffed this area were very polite and professional. We had a very soft itinerary so they were very helpful in aiding us in our activity selections. They had a map with the subway lined out for just about any activity we could think of. I've read complaints about the size of the place & getting lost - even though we were warned about it, it happened to us too. It was only bothersom on our first day after we came off of a 13hr flight, tired, jetlagged, & hungry. It took us a few attempts to find our way out the right exit. Our room wasn't bad. I was expecting it to be small and it was, but somehow it was optically deceptive in that it didn't ""look"" as small as it was. Our view was lousy unfortunately. We were on the 5th floor and it overlooked the side of another building. No biggie though as we didn't spend much time in our room. There is an ATM in the bottom of the main tower in the post office. I only mention it b/c we ran out of cash - take more than you think you'll need b/c MANY places don't take CCs. They will also provide you a box for shipping home souveniers for a price (naturally). It was expensive to do this, but we got our box on our doorstep in less than a week!I can't comment on any of the restaurants other than to say they were very expensive. We took most of our meals in the Akasaka district right outside the hotel. Word of warning to my fellow coffee drinkers: coffee shops open much later in the day in Tokyo. Very frustrating if you're still on Western time - you may have to wait till after 9am to find an open coffee shop (Tullee's within the hotel included). We had breakfast in the hotel twice. Once in the open dining area with a great view of the gardens. The food was disappointing for the price at this location. There is another breakfast buffett near the front entrance and I thought the food was much better there.There is soooo much to do in Tokyo - but for what it's worth, some of my favorite things:Take the day trip to Mt. Fuji - very informative and fun. Go see The Great Buddah in Kamakura - neat village around there with shops and shrines. Alot some time to spend in Harajuku - Wow! Great people watching and a shoppers dream. Definately go to the Tsushigi (sp?) fish market. If you'll be jetlagged, you may want to do this on your very first day since you'll likely be awake at 4am anyway. (If the fish market is a ""maybe"" on your itinerary, move it to the top of your list) Try Japanese kareoke - there is one right accross from the hotel. This was so much fun we did it twice.","Fayetteville, Arkansas","BandN129</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fayetteville, Arkansas</strong>",71,4.0

There are myriads and I mean myriads of tiny shops and boutiques of all kinds in this hotel which is actually almost three different hotels in three towers, all connected at different levels and we never finished seeing all of it from the inside. There are several options to eat inside, but obviously expensive as this seems more of a business hotel, but we just walked towards Yotsuya on a couple of occasions when stuck and there are plenty of realworld options like Subway, a fast food outlet (like First Kitchen, Fresh burger etc which are the Japanese versions of McD or BK). All in all, the hotel was clean, staff very friendly, helpful and efficient (no different anywhere in Japan though) and the rooms were very very roomy, unlike some others.

The deluxe triple room is almost like a mini suite, about 700sq ft, with a separate living area, and a bedroom. The staffs are excellent. The attention to details is simply amazing. The tea cups, and the teaspoons so precisely lined up every single day. The fresh flower in the vase on the vanity was changed either two or three times during our stay.The Japanese Garden is breathtaking. Our eight year old was thrilled checking out the kois on the pond, and by the waterfall. When we were in the Japanese Garden, we felt that we were in an oasis, so serene and peaceful. The outdoor sports facilities are amazing. We had stayed at other hotels in Tokyo, we've never seen anything quite like this before, it's a resort in the middle of the bustling Tokyo.The location is great, the subway station is just right across the bridge from the hotel.

Whether I had a city view or a garden view made no difference -- each was interesting in different ways.The breakfast buffet on the main level was extremely good, and it was always nice to start the day looking out on the 600-year-old garden. The variety of foods was good, the fruit very fresh, and I consistently found that I ended up eating healthier at the New Otani than at other hotels. The Top of the Tower buffet is a bit more expensive for similar food, and the other restaurant has a larger selection, but can get crowded.For business travel the location is great -- just a block from a major metro station that can access the Ginza, Marunochi, and other lines. The hotel is not in a particularly touristy area, so don't expect lots of attractions, but there are plenty of restaurants and stores nearby.I haven't stayed elsewhere in Tokyo, but I've stayed at several places in greater Asia, and I found the New Otani to be squarely at the Very Good level.

The room was totally spotless and had everything we needed. The bathroom was large. I am a big guy and we had more than enough room and great view. One small piece of advise would be if you need a ""cold"" room to sleep in keep the black out curtain closed all day and the air on max.... otherwise the air may not have the strength to cool the room down especially if it is hot. The hotel sits on a beautiful piece of property with a beautiful garden which you definitely should walk through. We even popped for the brunch one day simply to look out at it. ps the brunch for Tokyo was good not great when compared to similar typical hotel brunches but we were not disappointed. Across the street is a great neighborhood for finding a good restaurant and it is very close to the metro. taxi's also abound and I did not find them very expensive as we stayed away from busy traffic times and like London the driver's really pride themselves on getting you where you want to go quickly. Honesty is embedded in the culture so no worries there. The hotel is accessible by easy, frequent and not expensive airport shuttles. The staff is totally friendly and could not do enough to help us.

Here are the good and the bad:Good: About 100 yards from a subway stop (of course this is after walking 200 yards from your room to the front door - see ""bad""), absolutely top notch sushi bar in the garden wing lobby floor (6th floor) although you'll pay 11000 yen for the omekase which is over priced, stunning 400 year old secluded garden on hotel grounds including a beautiful waterfall that you can see from one off the main restaurants with huge fish in the ponds and feral cats running around, nice view from the top floor restaurant including of Mt Fuji on clear days, Taxis are always available and waiting so if you need one, no problem (though in Tokyo they are extremely expensive). Service is good.Bad: Air conditioning does not work well and does not remove enough humidity. This is not an isolated issue as my coworkers who have stayed here several times over the last several years have attested. This will drive Americans crazy as we tend to like our AC. The western breakfast in both major cafes are *really* mediocre. About the only thing that was halfway decent were the custom made omelets. Otherwise I didn't have a decent breakfast the entire trip. Hotel is extremely spread out, exactly like Las Vegas. Each major wing of the hotel is about 150 yards apart, and it seems to get out of the hotel you need to walk about 5-10 minutes from your room. If you are dressed in a suit and in a hurry this gets old fast. While the Akasaka district offers some fun restaurants, the general area is very sleepy and somewhat boring. You'll need to get on the subway to do much.

Unless you are a frequent traveler here don't bother. I had read you got a free breakfast and other things no you don't... Anyway we were shown to our first room which had twin beds and a view of a motorway... Back down to reception and a wait of over 2 hours for our next room ( we had also been traveling for over 26 hours by this point...) Any way a room was found on the 36th floor with a view of the gardens. Well worth the extra wait.The room was small and very dated (70s show springs to mind) However it was comfortable and very very clean. Lots of travel essentials in the bathrooms. A complicated toilet. Hairdryer etc.Great tea and coffee things and a cool kettle... Lovely kimonos and robes and slippers. Plenty of info on the hotel which was handy... We tried at one point to have room service to empty the fridge so we could put our own beer in... Slight problem with translation so we just emptied ourselves and put in corner till our departures.We ate in the hotel a few times... Tomcats which is cheap and cheerful although to Smokey for us... Had a great meal in trader vics. great service and the food was great. A little expensive but good. Also ate twice in the bistro next to reception not too expensive and good food but the service wasn't the best... We also had a drink in the bar up on the top floor as the view was amazing and great for photos but the prices were stupid. A beer and wine 25 euros. Also had a drink one night on the ground floor this was just as expensive. But thats hotels for you.The hotel had some great amenities such as 2 handy food shops (don't buy fruit 25 euros for a bunch of grapes). A chemist which was great as I caught a cold on the flight over. A travel agent who gave us times and costs to Kyoto... ( just buy ticket at station its cheaper). A post office with a European ATM. Lots of shops some expensive some not. Its nice to window shop though.The concierge was very handy. Although they were way of with there taxi price advice. They booked all sorts of things for us.The area is akasaka. So much to see and do in this area. Plenty of good restaurants and very easy access to the metro which we used all the time. No need to buy an all day pass all the time... Usually takes a day to explore an area. It was a 5 minute walk from the 36th floor to the ticket machine in the metro station...Should anyone want to ask a question or need prices for anything I would be very happy to help.A great hotel with fabulous staff.Ps Only down side really was the limo bus but doesn't start early enough for 9am flights at this hotel so had to get a taxi to the bus station at 5 am to get our flight at 9am...,"Nenagh, Ireland","Emma C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nenagh, Ireland</strong>",69,4.0

Three nights we were in the Garden Tower and one in the Main. The Main tower is a newer more contemporary styled Tower. The rooms are the same size, but the Main tower rooms have a floor to ceiling window which gives you a nice view. The Garden tower is a bit dated, but still comfortable. When we got to our room, it was on the 12th floor facing the garden and it was beautiful. We even had a view of Mt. Fuji!! Overall, the hotel is a good choice in that it's a good price (230 for garden, 330 for main) and it's about a 7-10 min walk to the Yotsuya train station.As for the rest of the hotel, the staff was very helpful, attentive, and spoke english. The resteraunts are ok, but we only tried the sushi and the bfast buffet. But, avoid the sushi rest (can't remember the name, in the garden tower). It's below average and a complete rip off. You're much better off going to Roppogi and getting sushi there. As for breakfast, there's a buffett in the lounge area overlooking the garden which is beautiful. If you'd rather have a quick bfast, try the train station (yotsuya). They have a Beck's Coffee shop on street level as you enter the station, that serves a delicious breakfast (eggs, toast, yogurt, coffee or hot choc.) for about 6 bucks!For a 4 star hotel, this is a good deal, convenient location and has great service.","Los Angeles, California","HBR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",23,4.0

On both occasions, it was for 3-4 days.The hotel is huge, and has a complex layout. On my first visit, I actually got lost and had to ask my way around. However, the staff is really efficient and helpful. They all speak English, so it wasn't a problem to find my way.The entire complex houses not only the hotel but also several offices, a shopping complex (apart from the one in the main lobby area) and a few other things.The hotel is located centrally in Tokyo, and a short way from most places that one might want to visit. It is a convenient 3-5 minute walk from the nearest Metro station (Akasaka-Mitsuke, if I am not mistaken). Ask the concierge for a map of the locality and they'll be able to give you an English map with everything around the hotel marked neatly on it. Once you have that map, exploring the area is quite easy.As the title of this review says, the Top of the Tower breakfast is a great experience. Not only in the menu very good, but the view of Tokyo is excellent too. The size of the breakfast area is an issue sometimes because there can be too many guests turning up at the same time. Try to go very early or very late to avoid the queue.On the downside, the rooms are a bit on the smaller side. That seems to be the case with most hotels in Tokyo though.","New Delhi, India","intrepid2k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Delhi, India</strong>",8,4.0

By US standards the size is just a bit smaller than your average 3 star hotel room. I had a king bed in the garden tower and was fine by myself space wise. The bed was hard and you could feel the springs, but everything else was pretty comfortable and clean. Nice 27"" plasma TV, lots of freebie toiletries, robes and slippers, casual kimono sleepwear, and paid minibar. The decor was a bit dated, but overall I thought the room was fine for what I paid compared to other hotels in the area.The food: Western food at the Otani sucks, so stick with Japanese food if you eat there. The main restaurants (the ones that they advertise and put at the forefront of entrances to trick you into thinking that's all that is available) are expensive! Expect to pay up to $50-150 USD for a meal at those places. A few reasonable places include the following:Tully's - Starbucks-esque coffee shop. The coffee isn't great, but you can get a cup of Joe, a ham & cheese hot pocket, and a pastry for less than 10 bucks.Towada and Niizu - These are soba noodle restaurants so they are casual and less expensive. You can get a tasty authentic soba meal for around $20 (which is still expensive for soba, but not as painfully expensive as the other restaurants).The western-style cocktails were no better than the food (bartenders could not make a decent cosmo), so again, stick with Japanese style drinks like sake and japanese beer.The recreation - One of the reviewers said that you had to pay to use the gym. This is not entirely true. The fancy gym cost over $50 bucks to use. But there are 2 ""workout rooms"" that have a couple elliptical machines, treadmills, and stationary bikes that you can use for free. Also check out the ""relaxation room"" near the business center and next to the workout room in the Garden Tower that has a shiatsu massage chair that you can enjoy for free. You do have to pay $20 to use the pool.The shopping - There are so many shops at the New Otani, but they mostly cater to middle aged business folks and their spouses. I guess that makes sense.General comments - the New Otani is right next to a Tokyo metro stop, ask the staff which entrance to use to get there as the hotel complex is quite large. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. You can get just about anything by asking the front desk. I borrowed an adapter and rented a japanese cell phone from the front desk. Oh, and you have to ask housekeeping to bring you an iron and they only let you keep it for 1 hour. So I ironed my entire wardrobe so that I wouldn't need to keep borrowing it. The same thing happened when I was in Sapporo - don't know what's up with that. All in all, I was quite satisfied with my stay at the New Otani Hotel.","Brooklyn, NY","Mizorka</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong>",9,4.0

But, Tokyo has so many excellent restaurants I'm not sure why you would want to eat in the hotel anyway. The staff was friendly, helpful, and really seemed to have an interest in making sure we were pleased. Because we signed up for the New Otani Club (available on their website) we were automatically upgraded to a better room, so it is worth the effort.

The main lobby and other areas a little dated in their furnishings but clean and high quality. Although there are something like 35 or 37 bars and restaurants, they are pricy, especially the branch of the famous Paris restuarant located on the main floor ($400 easily for the menu without any drinks). The sandwich luncheon buffet overlooking the lovely Japanese garden is worth enjoying but be early as there is a rush and the food starts to run out. Likewise highly recommended is a tea house in the garden and another sushi-type little restaurant hidden in centre of the garden. The breakfast on the 40th floor at $35 is not worth that price except for the view of Mount Fuji which was perhaps worth the price. There is a Starbucks in the lower shopping level which is fine.

This meant we were only 3 or 4 stations away from Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ginza and Akihabara.

The “deluxe” room is double the size of a regular standard room, complete with a large living room area. Our room was clean, with a huge bathroom.

Normally, I prefer to avoid large hotels and this really is a big one, as others have said, more like a small town than a hotel.The clinchers for me are the New Otani's seamless service, the marvellous Japanese garden and the reasonable room rate. Every time I get off the airport bus and a bell boy runs to get the bags I know that I will be looked after as well as in some of the world's most expensive hotels. Many of the staff call me by my name when they meetme in the corridor, something that is not common in many other hotelswhere I have also been a regular.I am amazed to read some complaints on TA about the attitude of some members of staff. I do wonder if some guests appreciate that Japan remains a different culture from the West. For example, raising your voice is considered very rude indeed and causing an employee, particularly a junior one, to loose face will ensure a sudden drop inservice from anyone who observes this. As in most circumstances in Japan, a smile and an apology for being a nuisance will get you a great deal further than will a loud complaint.My main worry about the New Otani is that when the refurbishment is completed there will be a dramatic increase in prices and I won't be able to stay there any more.",London,"Japanafan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",10,5.0

Staff are helpful and polite, the rooms are a good size, amenities are good, room rates were reasonable (for Tokyo) and the location in Akasaka gives you a good base for exploring the rest of the city. Things that really impressed us: * We were able to check into our room straight away despite arriving mid-morning - a real blessing after a long overnight flight.* Ease of travel to and from the airport. The airport limousine bus to Akasaka stops at the hotel. * The hotel gardens - makes for a nice easy stroll for the jet-lagged!* Proximity of the metro station - nearest entrance was just a few minutes from the hotel.* The funky Japanese toilet!The downsides to this hotel were few, and in our opinion, easily avoided:* As other reviewers have noted, the restaurants are uber-expensive, but you'll find plenty of dining options around the hotel (there's a whole street of restaurants, karaoke bars etc right near the metro station less than 5 minutes' walk away). * Our room looked straight out onto the adjoining office building, and we could see people at their desks (not sure if they could see us); but if that bothers you, there'd be plenty of rooms that didn't look onto this.* The hotel complex is vast, which makes it pretty much impossible to avoid having to walk longer than normal distances to get anywhere in or out of the hotel.

Fuji from our hotel room (34th floor). It is rather rare to be able to see Mt. Fuji due to a number of atmospheric conditions or man made structures that obstruct the view.~~~~~~~~~~There is much more to like about this hotel than there is to dislike. I will begin with listing the cons in case that is what you use the most in making your decision of what you would choose to avoid. That’s generally where I tend to start when I am looking. *Cons*What I don’t like about this hotel*1. The inside of this hotel can be confusing as you navigate your way around the hallways. So, you might want to get a map of the inside from the concierge to help orient you for the first day or so.2. It is a long walk to the main lobby from the tower when you find that you have to do it several times a day. This is where the concierges desk is (The bell captains counter in the 'tower' lobby is not the concierges desk). 3. The restaurants are expensive and the food portions are small. 4. The location is a bit of a distance from the more visited sites. But, the sites in Tokyo are spread out from one another so you would have to use the train/subway either way. 5. There is only one bathroom sink and vanity which makes thing a bit crowed to share at the same time.6. Waiting on the elevator to go down to the lobby is a minor irritation.*The Two Lobby’s*------------------------------The tower lobby is not the main lobby. To get to the main lobby you come out of the elevators and once inside the tower lobby you go left down to the end of the corridor. The bellmen in the 'tower' lobby are limited on their tourist info and help. You will do will to go to the 'main lobby' and to the concierges desk where they have more information and maps and they speak and understand English very well. *Hotel Service* ----------------------The complete service is the wonderful aspect of this Hotel. The staff is so very helpful and polite and courteous and friendly. There was only one staff member that seemed a little bit put-out and that was the young man at the counter where we made our bus and tour reservations. Besides that, everyone treated us exceptionally well. Even the maids bow and (if you are present) apologetically clean your room. There are more than enough staff members to perceive your every need. And they are always visible and waiting. *The concierges*------------------------Every one of the concierge’s in the main lobby was very helpful and kind. Take advantage of their knowledge and printed material and don’t worrying how much to tip because you are not required to tip at all. If need be they will also give you verbal and detailed information on how to get to various locations using the subway system.The concierges will be able to arrange a Tokyo city tour (with the Gray Line Bus Service) for either a half or full day. A half a day was approximately 4,800 yen (close to. $40.00 USD). There is also a travel agent office in the building that can help you with tours. *Elevators*------------------The elevators in the lobby area of the tower (where our room was located) almost instinctively knew when we were approaching and would open. There are cameras and security throughout the hotel so perhaps the staff had a hand in the intuitiveness of the elevator. But, there seemed to perpetually be a bit of a long wait to take the elevator back down to the lobby. Our room was on the 34th floor. Our room was just a few doors away from the elevator but even still, it was quiet.*View (from our room on the 34th floor)*--------------------------------------------------------We had a wonderful view of the Japanese Garden below. And on the one day it was clear we had an honorable view of Mt. Fuji. Looking a bit to the right, way off in the distance, we could see the big video screens of Shibuya.*Breakfast*----------------The breakfast buffet in the Garden Lounge Restaurant of the Hotel has a variety of breads, rolls, croissants, muffins, cereals, salad, cheese, yogurt, and fresh sliced fruits such as apple, kiwi, peaches, melon, pineapple, and a few others. Some westerners that we talked to thought it strange that there were French fries at the breakfast buffet but really how different is that from fried potatoes or hash brown potatoes? You can additionally order off the menu and have eggs, ham, sausage, bacon and some other various foods that most Americans eat for breakfast but, keep in mind that you will have to pay additional yen. And it is not an inexpensive affair to eat at this hotel. There is an extra 10% to the bill for service. But, it is not required that you pay a tip. I thoroughly enjoyed the salad with the hotel’s sesame dressing even though it was for breakfast. I ate it every morning for the entire week that I was there. Breakfast is 7:00 am to 10:00 am. The breakfast buffet cost 1,890 yen (approximately, $15.60) without any additional items. You can order pancakes and waffles (893 yen), egg with ham, bacon or sausage ( 1,155 yen). These were the prices during the beginning of February 2007. That should give you a rough idea of the cost. Oh, and if you get there early enough you will most likely be able to be seated by the window where you can have a lovely view of the Japanese Garden.*Lunch & Dinner*------------------------We ate dinner at the Hotel 3 times and lunch twice for the sake of convenience. The food was good but as I stated before, a bit on the expensive side and the portions are a bit small. I don’t recall what it was we had for our meals.*Bedroom*-------------------We had a room with a king size bed. The room was of sufficient size but the dresser drawers were not full size height. The closet was about the size that you typically see in a hotel but, it did have a room safe where you could place your valuables. There were slippers for your feet in the closet. There were only Japanese language television stations. The bed was quite comfortable and everything was immaculately clean. Our room was reasonably quiet except for the occasional faint sound of an emergency vehicle on the road below. There is a fully stocked mini bar in the room with only a small bit of room to add any items of your own. There is an automatic hot water pot for coffee and tea as well as the cups to use. *Bathroom*-------------------The bathroom had only one sink with a vanity, and a full size tub with a removable shower head attached to a metal linking hose. The tub faucet was one where you could adjust the force of the spray without readjusting the temperature (pleasant feature). The toilet is a bidet style with one spray for the front and the one for the behind. You can also adjust the force of these hygienic sprays. (The toilets in the main lobby area are also the bidet style but they have the added feature of a heated seat.)When you are finished with your shower and your bathroom mirror is all foggy, you will see a clear spot above the sink that stays fog free for your viewing pleasure. *A Hotel Convenience*----------------------------------There are shops in the hotel and some are under the main floor. There is a convenience store under the main lobby where you can purchase beer and wine and a few goodies. To get to the store, take the main lobby elevator down 2 floors, go towards the ramp and stairs then when you come to the end you will have to make a right. Walk on a short distance and there is where you will find the convenience store. *Subway train station*--------------------------------The Akasaka Mitsuke subway station is just a couple of blocks away and the concierges in the 'main lobby' (not the tower lobby) can explain how to take the different lines. You will most likely be using the subway a lot because most of the sites are spread out around the city. *Airport to Hotel and return*----------------------------------------Transportation to and from the Narita airport can be done by using one of the express subway trains for most of the destination and a taxi to and from the train (about one hour). Or you can pay a little more (approx. $30 USD) and travel by motor couch and expect one to two hours travel depending on the traffic. We came in by way of train and taxi which I would not recommend doing if you have much luggage because there is not a lot of places for luggage on the train. We returned to the airport by way of motor couch which is somewhat fairly priced and our luggage was placed in the luggage compartment. Granted you need to allow approximately 2 hours travel time by way of motor couch due to traffic but this allowed me to be worry-free about being rude with my luggage strewn about on the train.","San Diego, CA","misplaced</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, CA</strong>",146,5.0

However, when it was time to pay, they would not cancel the second charge! They said it was too complicated to cancel it on the bill... We also had to wait 25 minutes before they brought a fresh towel to the room. It's not a terrible amount of time to wait but still, not that great when you pay for first class service. The hotel itself is well located but it is still somewhat under constraction and it is very easy to get lost in all the long corridors.

We found lots of very reasonably priced restaurants serving many different kinds of Japanese food within easy walking distance of the hotel. We particularly liked Jangara Ramen, which serves the prime minister's favorite ramen.The New Otani is massive. We found it convenient to have many services at our disposal. For example, on a couple occasions we bought groceries at the am/pm and/or the supermarket in the hotel and had a picnic in our room. We bought shinkansen train tickets to Kyoto from the travel agency. (This was after we had gone to Tokyo Station and were unable to figure out where to buy the tickets.) We used the international ATM at the post office to withdraw yen. And it was very easy for us to get to and from Narita using the airport limousine bus.Service at the New Otani, like everywhere in Japan, is really good. The staff were extremely polite and gracious. For example, after we stayed at the New Otani for 4 nights, we stored some of our luggage there while we visited Kyoto for 2 nights. We returned to the New Otani for our last night in Japan before our flight back to the States.

The brunch buffet was a little expensive, but it was peaceful to eat it next to a garden and waterfall.I did not love the location of the hotel. While it was only a few block walk to the nearest subway, there was not much of a neighborhood around the hotel.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","dsnyc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",16,4.0

Athough many of the previous have been quite negative, I was happy with the standard of our room and the service we received at the hotel. Here are my thoughts and recommendations. We were recomended to stay here as it is regarded as one of the traditional big Tokyo hotels and an established venue to receive clients and discuss business. After reading the reviews on here , we avoided booking a Tower room and instead found a good deal for a new refurbished Standard room in the Main Building by booking directly via the New Otani website. We made several enquires with agents and online and found that most places were selling the Tower rooms at the same rates as booking directly and in some cases even more. We paid around 30,000 Yen which worked out to be around £130 per night and took advantage of a special offer for New Otani Members which included breakfast (We joined as members online just before making the booking).The room itself was refurbished to a high standard, neutral walls with dark real hardwood fixtures and fittings and a big HD LCD tv. The room layout and size was pretty standard around 280sq ft in total. We were up on the 13th floor, garden side and had a fantastic view of a wooded park, skyscrapers and on clear days Mount Fuji in the background. This was because of the newly installed top to bottom 1 piece panoramic windows, all our visitors commented on the great view. I especially liked the hidden ventilation hatch that you could open to allow fresh air in to the room. Another thing which I noticed was that the room was completely soundproofed, I didn't hear our neigbours at all (unlike the place I am currently staying in in HK!).The hotel was huge! 2 hotel buildings joined together by a shopping complex which itself appeared to be on several levels with numerous restaurants. It was quite confusing at first to navigate. The clientele were predominantly Japanese - retired groups, business men or even politcians apparently. I got the impression The New Otani was a very traditional, venerable, old money type of place. Throughout our stay there were daily conferences, school reunions, association meetings so the atmosphere tended to be very sedate and genteel. The service itself was very polite, quite effcient but some of the older front desk members could be quite stuffy. The spoken English amongst the staff was not brilliant but all our enquires and requests were dealt with efficiently. Internet was not included in our pacakge and was extra at around 2100 Yen (£10) per 24hrs but I felt this should have this really should have been included with our room. Breakfast selection was large, varied and good quality, serving Japanese, American and Continetal breakfast. If you can, take time out to walk around the large Japanese Garden with waterfall and huge Koi carps. I would not recommend eating at the hotel restuarants unless you can claim it as an company expense or budget is not an issue. We arrived late and jetlagged and decided to try out the ShabuShabu restaurant ""Okahan"". Nice food, cooked and served by a sweet old Japanese lady in a Kimono, but the bill came to around £140 with no drinks, it was good but not that good! Instead, ask Concierge for a map of restraurants in nearby Akasaka Mitsuke by cuisine (they won't produce this unless you ask.). On the main Akasaka Misuke ""strip"" I would recommend ""Za Watami"" (can't miss the b+w sign, on 2nd floor), the ground floor Tempura restaurant (plastic tempura models oustide) and along the adjacent main road (near Citibank, which has a international cash machine) a steak restaurant called ""Kuni's Place"" where you purchase Japanese marbled beef by per 100gms. All these meals were cheap ranging from £15 - £45 for 2. If you are a cake fan you have to try ""Cozy Corner"" for the Japanese take on European style cakes.The hotel was well located in a quiet area. Nearest and most convinient Metro station was on the Tower side - Akasaka Mitsuke - turn right just after you cross the bridge over the river/moat and go down exit D. This station sits on the Ginza and Maranouchi lines and get you to the major districts directly. Taxis were not too expensive and taxi drivers seemed honest. However don't take a taxi from Narita airport. It was our first time in Tokyo and we opted for the Aiport Limousine bus which cost 3000 yen each way and completely stress free. The journey did take over an hour but the buses are very comfortabe and clean. We didn't get to do much sightseeing but would recommend Isetan Department store in Shinjuku for onestop tax free shopping, Harajuku to see the latest Japanese youth fashions, Otemesando Hills for great shopping, also admire the well designed shopping centre and the unique Prada store. Visit the Park Hyatt Shinjiku to ride the superfast elavators and go to the view gallery up the top. Tokyo looked amazing at night with the skyscrapers and twinkling red lights, its a scene straight out of the film Akira. We loved Tokyo and the New Otani made our stay feel welcoming and relaxed. I would deifnitely stay here again and probably opt for the deluxe room for a bit more space. Already missing the Otani as we are currently in HK staying at a much inferior hotel!!

The hotel is old and does not have anything stylish or contemporary and looks rather dull, but their service was impeccable. The hotel staff were incredibly polite, pleasant, and efficient.My room was on the 22nd floor in the Tower and had a nice view. It was spotlessly clean. It had a king-size bed, a large work/dinning table with a chair, a large sofa, a flat panel TV on the cabinet, an electrical kettle, a fridge, and a safe in the closet. Though I had to rearrange the drinks in the fridge to store my own food, they did not charge me any for that. The room was spacious and I thought was larger than the king-bedded rooms at the Hiltons, Sheratons, and Marriotts in major US cities I have stayed at. They provided tooth brushes and tooth pastes, disposable razors, disposable slippers, disposable hairbrushes, and yukatas (Japanese style pajamas), in addition to the regular toiletry and room amenities. If you need an iron and an iron board, you have to call house-keeping and return the set within one hour. Internet access from a hotel room was expensive (2100 yen/24 hours) and no free Wifi was detected. Room service was expensive, but the portion of the dishes I ordered was pretty generous based on the Japanese standard. Meals at the hotel restaurants were also expensive, but given the great views from the restaurants and their impeccable services I would consider the prices reasonable. If you like French pastries, try Satsuki in the Main building. If you look for cheap eats, try the Akasaka Mitsuke area, to which you just walk 5 minutes from the hotel (exit from the Tower, not from the Main). You can get a map of restaurants in the area from the concierge or you just walk around to see what’s available.The hotel is located in a nice and quiet neighborhood with good access to public transportation. If you would like to experience the traditional Japanese courtesy, this hotel could be a good option for you. Mind you that the hotel has some designated areas for smoking. If you are sensitive to smoking, you would likely get annoyed by the smell. I’d recommend that you obtain the New Otani club membership with which you can receive some privileges and services including free continental breakfast at the club room.","Tokyo, Japan","TokyoBorn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",18,5.0

As several reviews have noted, there is a remodel underway for the Main building at the New Otani. I had a newly remodeled room and wanted to report on it.The Main building has been undergoing remodeling for approximately 1 year. They are renovating each of the three wings in succession. The first remodeled wing just opened in October. So currently the Main building is 1/3 remodeled, 1/3 old, and 1/3 closed.I booked a ""superior"" remodeled room in the Main, but at check-in, it was not available. They upgraded me at no cost to an Executive style Deluxe room! How wonderful! The executive deluxe rooms are both larger than superior rooms, and have nicer fixtures. This was a very nice touch of service.Apart from that, however, I'd like to comment on the features that are common to all of the newly remodeled rooms. First, the rooms have been essentially gutted and rebuilt. This starts with the beautiful new windows (triple pane, floor to ceiling), through the bathrooms (beautiful and efficient) to redesign of the infrastructure (digital TV, well-planned PC/internet workspace). The color scheme has changed from the pastel look of the old rooms to a striking black and chrome style.How about the construction -- does it pose problems? Absolutely none that I observed. There was no construction noise during the day, no mess, no dust, nothing. The closed wing appears to be completely sealed both inside and out. Inside the building, it's been walled off so successfully you wouldn't even know it was there. On the outside it is completely encased and there is no sign of the construction. So don't let it bother or scare you away!The only downside of the remodel, I think, is that the prices have gone up for the new rooms, as compared to the old. The new pricing puts the New Otani into the same price range as Grand Hyatt and other top notch Tokyo hotels. However, with the beautiful new, large rooms, along with its many other positive qualities (location, services, etc), it deserves to be in that class. Note that most of the offers at travel sites are either for the Tower rooms (fine but moderate in age and with less personality than the Main) or for the old Main rooms. If your travel site doesn't show them, you might want to check directly with the hotel's website for offers on the newly remodeled rooms.The New Otani is a very large property, definitely not at all a boutique hotel. But it is a wonderful, convenient, friendly, and now up-to-date (at least in the new Main) hotel. Highly recommended if you want a central Tokyo location with full services.","Seattle, WA","cnchapman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, WA</strong>",85,5.0

It's therefore rather diificult to understand how the hotel management has let the 20th century pass by without updating the property. Room decor and furnishings are from the 1940s, and were probably not even second-class quality when they were new. The Japanese restaurants are top quality but not very welcoming to Westerners arriving on their own (I happen to be a woman travelling alone on business, and generally get reactions of horrified panic when I try to enter---even though my Japanese is pretty darn good). I find the Western food, in contrast to other reviewers here, absolutely revolting. It's that 1960s Japanese interpretation of Western food which features weird combinations (hot dogs on sugar bread; everything covered with mayonnaise, spaghetti with tomoato sauce topped with seaweed shavings, etc etc). The gym has literally not been renovated since 1962----I asked. Yes, the garden is lovely....why not stop and check it out on your way to a nicer hotel?","NYC, NY","hotelvet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NYC, NY</strong>",13,2.0

Travel to the hotel took about 90 minutes. Upon arrival we were greeted and quickly and effiiciently escorted to check-in. The process was quick and easy. We had a very large king bed room on the 39th floor. It was immaculately clean with a fully stocked bar and one of the most tasteful appointed and decorated bathrooms we have seen. The tile walls and floors complemented the spacious shower and large garden tub. The toilet was modern and included the various washing amenities--all automated.The staff of the hotel went out of their way to be helpful, were always friendly and always available.The hotel has 30+ bars and restaurants. In our opinion the Satsuki coffee room is the best place to have a quiet relaxing meal. The food selection is varied and all choices taste very good. Prices in this restaurant are comparable with NY, DC, LA, etc. The Prime Rib, is very expensive, the food quality is good and the service is first rate. The restaurants on the 40th floor were no match compared to the two previously mentioned.The hotel has a four hundred year old oriental garden with waterfall and pond. It is meticulously maintained and is the perfect place for a quiet walk after a stress full day. It is incredibly peaceful and quiet, There are two small restaurants in the gardens and the food at both is very good. The night time views of the illuminated gardens are spectacular.The hotel is located two blocks from the subway making it very easy to reach any area of Tokyo.

They were more than helpful to us. This was demonstrated when we lost an umbrella and the bellhop lady came running through the hotel after us to bring it to us. She was out of breath when she got to us! Also, when we thought that I had lost our passports the staff turned the hotel upside down and even the Housekeeping Manager got directly involved! What more could you ask for?What a location! If you walk through the building through the tower, the hotel complex is a short walk away down a hill to the Akasaka-Mitsuke subway station. Here you will have a direct-line connection to Tokyo Station, Ginza, and Shinjuku via the Marunouchi or Ginza subway lines. There is a pleasant park and little lake close by where people fish.

So, I was very pleased to find a ""low rate"" - $160/night. The part that wasn't disclosed was that the hotel was in the middle of a renovation...the first since the hotel opened in 1964(or thereabouts) - according to their website (this was not posted at the time of my reservation!)I entered the hotel from the ""tower"" side (approach from the Asakusa-Mitsuke metro). When you enter from this side, you actually enter the hotel through an office building. There is NO hotel staff until you enter the building and get to the 6th floor. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, except that I had lots of luggage and had traveled by train and metro for over 3 hours from Kyoto...I was tired and wanted a bell boy to help!When I finally got to the lobby, the bell boys were there, but were of no help. I then had to go through 20 mins of negotiation to find a room since mine ""wasn't ready"" (it was 1:30pm). I offered to leave my luggage and go shopping but they didn't want to store my two bags (reasonable size...25"" and a 20""). No reason was provided for not wanting to store the luggage. Finally, a smoking room was located (I had asked for non smoking). When I begged (between genuine coughs and sniffles), I was provided an air purifier unit (this was the #1 positive...I'll admit that they did provide a good air purifier and I did get over my cigarette smoke related sinus infection).The lobby and common areas looked ""standard"" for this class of hotel. So, I was shocked to enter the room to find a throwback to the late 70's early 80's! The only way I was able to turn the clock closer to the 80's is the TV style. Initially, I thought that the TV was as old as the hotel...but then I remembered that TV's in the 60's had the channel changing knobs. This tv didn't have the knobs. The notable accoutrement to the TV? A thick layer of soot all over the plastic case! Must have been from the prior smokers (I can't imagine one chain smoker causing that much soot!Another era clue...the bedstand. The last time I saw a bedstand with buttons and a dial clock like that one was back in the early 70's. There were buttons to control the tv channels too...but the room had been upgraded with closed circuit and a ""newer"" remote (maybe from the 90's?)The beds were as hard as a rock...reminds me of my old bed, circa 1965. The clues...no quilting, no padding...just rock hard! The linens...probably not circa 1965...but they weren't modern duvet with cool, puffy innerds. There was a high speed internet connection for an additional 2100 yen per day, measured from noon to noon. I wasn't able to use it though because there is NO available electrical plug at the desk (another era clue...the original desk configurations were never made for laptops...) I did search and found a neat octopus behind the desk for the closed circuit tv unit, the tv and the network box, as well as the mini fridge. No outlet was left for my laptop. I suppose I could have used my battery then recharged at the outlet across the room, but for 2100 yen/day, I didn't want to go through that much trouble. There are internet cafes and wireless spots everywhere, for much less.The bathroom was fine, except for the lovely burns above the sconce light fixtures (probably the result of the use of high wattage bulbs in the fixtures). This was checked for safety...but no one felt that this was an aesthetic problem. There were also ""smoke trails"" on the walls coming from the air exchange from the central A/C. Since I'm not a smoker, I don't know if this is ""standard"" for smoking rooms...but I didn't find it pleasant.The room was always dark, even with the lights on, due to the placement of the fixtures. The chairs had obvious wear on the seats and you just ""sank"" into the seat...like the support was giving way.The bellboy service was not pleasant. The head bell boy always passed me off to the other bell boys. The other bell boys seemed to know what I wanted, but had no answer. So I was left with the head bell boy who knew the answer, but didn't want to tell me. There was a concierge desk that was never manned and the bell boys didn't fill in! By the way...if you ask, the bell boys have a nice map indicating the local restaurants and what food they served. I went to the two shops labeled ""jap sweets"" and both places had EXCELLENT gift boxes. In the hotel's defense...I later learned that the service at ""The Main"" was excellent. The concierge was always too busy, so the manager always filled in and spoke to me in perfect English and always provided good directions - superfriendly, exactly what you expect from a Japanese hotel of that stature. Another staff member walked me to the ATM since it was hard to find (though she gave improper advice about which one to use...if you have a foreign bank card, you must use the ATM in the Post Office room, NOT the MUFJ ATM). Lesson Learned - if you want to stay at the New Otani before the end of The Main's renovation in 2007, ask whether you're in a renovated room or a non-renovated room. Also, ask NOT to stay at the Tower! All proper service is found at The Main (except bell boys...they were NEVER seen at The Main...). I think that they are selling the yucky rooms to unsuspecting tourists at cheap prices thinking that we deserve less. What they're really doing is ruining their reputation!

We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to anyone. We got a great deal online at Expedia for the flight and hotel together so we thought the rate was reasonable for a ""Luxury"" hotel in Tokyo (this was our first time in Tokyo). When we arrived check-in was easy, they unfortunately did not have any king beds left, we checked in a bit later in the day, but that was fine and we took 2 twin beds. We had opted for the deluxe size room which is a bit larger than a standard. We are glad that we did. The room size that we had was good for what we needed but the standard size might have been a tad too small. I know Japanese rooms tend to be smaller than American hotels anyway, so that's why we went with the deluxe. The room was very clean, and that is most important for me. Also, I know some people have had problems with the Main building (this is where we stayed), but we thought the room was perfectly fine - very clean and nothing seemed old or shabby.As usual restaurants in the hotel were very expensive, but this is to be expected. We had only breakfast twice at Satsuki, was pricey but good, and otherwise went outside the hotel for meals.The concierge was very helpful and booked 2 tours for us during our stay. They also provided us with a great map of the area to fing restaurants and other general stores (drug store, grocery, etc).Staff at the hotel was very friendly and we did not find them stuffy at all.

We knowingly paid a high price for a triple room at this hotel because we knew we would want a comfortable room after skiing. This was exactly what we got, a large 40sqm room (unusually large for Tokyo), well fitted out, with nice furnishings and a picture view of the Japanese garden below, the Shinjuku park in front and the office towers beyond. From the lobby right up to the room, this hotel is definitely one star up on the Akasaka Prince, particularly the beds--which are firmer and have much nicer comforters.My tip is to insist on a room in the ""Tower"" because when we called ahead to ask what is the difference, they told us all the rooms in the Main building were about to be renovated whereas the Tower rooms are still quite new. And if you could swing it, request a room facing the Shinjuku area, which has the best view in this hotel. If you have to pay extra for breakfast, then I urge you to do so. They give you a choice of 3 restaurants but by far the most stunning is the ""Top of the Tower"" on the 40th floor where on a sunny day (which is quite often between Nov to Feb), you would not want to leave.While the New Otani maybe more luxurious and comfortable, when it comes to service the Akasaka Prince wins hands down--from its concierge, business centre and reservations, all were too willing to please and efficient. In contrast, we felt the staff at the New Otani were a bit ""aloof"". My final tip is this, all double/twin rooms at the Akasaka Prince is 37sqm whereas in the New Otani Tower, they are 27sqm.Since I think both hotels are similarly priced and location wise they are right opposite each other (both are in one of the best neighbourhoods in Tokyo), if it's comfort and luxury you want, then choose the New Otani. If it's service and room size which concerns you then go for the Akasaka Prince (say if you have a child for intance, the 3 or you would be more comfortable at the Akasaka Prince since their double beds are 200cm or 79 inches wide). At the New Otani, you would need a triple room which would cost quite a bit more. We had emailed the Akasaka Prince concierge a bunch of questions on where to go, what to see and where to eat before arrival and when we checked in, they had printed out maps and clear directions in English for each of the places we enquired about ready for us, that's service !!",Hong Kong,"Flyer37249</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",22,4.0

Generally we found it to be a good experience but the hotel certainly is in need of a major update.Upon arriving, we were placed in a room in the main building. The room was pleasant but the furnishings are tired and sadly out of date. The TV was very old and the air conditioning did not function well. The ensuite bathroom was very small and again is very much out of date.Generally the public areas of the hotel are in good shape and of course there are many shops and restuarants in the complex. But watch out for the high prices in the restaurants and shops. They are way above what you find even in highly priced Tokyo!Before arriving, we applied for a Membership card for the New Otani group of hotels. This is a free offer and is supposed to provide members with a number of benefits including free breakfast. When we checked in, we were never told about breakfast. It was only when we asked that we were told that breakfast was not included in our rate. We were not satisfied with this answer and again reminded the front desk that we were club members. One staff member then told us that as members we could get a special basic breakfast (reduced continental) in a special room in the tower part of the hotel. They would only give members the regular breakfast if you paid a much higher rate than we had paid. We found this to be a misrepresentation of their part. ( The hotel website clearly shows a more extensive breakfast). Despite discussions with their senior manager, they would not budge and we were forced to accept their basic breakfast which consisted of bagels, pastries, coffee, tea and juice.Although comfortable, the datd decorating and the breakfast misrepresentaion, detracted from our stay at this hotel.","Oak Harbor, Washington","Colin3160</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oak Harbor, Washington</strong>",48,2.0

Although my reservation was for a tower room, I was put in the main building (suffering from jet lag I did not realize this at first and then did not want to bother to change). The main building is about to be renovated and it needs it. The room was slightly shabby, the curtains were drooping and the upholstery stained. Although I had a very good price for the room, you still don't expect that from a hotel of this caliber. The room had both terrycloth robes and japanese cotton robes, slippers, hot water and tea, refrigerator, safe and all the amenities. I could not get the internet connection in my room to work. The dining rooms are expensive and mostly have set meals, but there are other places close by. The tempura restaurant in the hotel was excellent and was very accomodating to my vegetarian daughter, which is a challenge in Japan as they want to use fish broth or bonito in everything.

Even the most basic business hotels in Japan provide you with green tea bags and certainly would never expect you to pay ¥450 for what initially looked like a complimentary bag of M&Ms?!! They also nearly all provide free LAN internet access, which is pretty much an essential when you work and travel, but the Otani's flat rate of ¥2100 (£11) for use of their in-room LAN connection left me slackjawed to say the least.As many other reviews have said, the restaurants within the hotel are very pricey, which isn't a problem with the whole of Tokyo as your backyard of course. However, if you ever happen to be spending Christmas Day in this hotel, be sure to make reservations somewhere else months in advance, or bring a packed lunch. I made the mistake of thinking that, with 11 restaurants, we'd be able to find something decent at a not-too-extortionate price, but it turns out that ¥9700 (£50pp) for an all-you-can-eat Chinese 'Banquet' in the rather dog-eared, somewhat faded Blue Sky Restaurant was the very cheapest option on offer.

To use the other private fitness facility,i.e. indoor pool and hi-tech gym would have cost in the region of 25 pounds for each visit.The location though good is opposite an area full of hostess / strip bars and lacked good restaurants (although in the opposite direction it does contain a splendid Indian restuarant).In summary a very good hotel but is not one I would recommend for a business trip.","London, UK","Culture11544</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, UK</strong>",8,4.0

The hotel is HUGE (lost our way several times) but the size of the hotel didn’t prevent us being treating as very special guests. The staff are gracious, super efficient and simply go out of their way to meet your every need. This was our first visit to Japan and we were overwhelmed by the politeness we were shown by everyone we met and the cleanliness of everywhere we went.We booked through Expedia and got a good deal (flew with Virgin – they’re great too). Our room was large (we stayed in the Main building). We had a walk in wardrobe, big telly, desk, sofa, kettle constantly hot, newspaper ever morning, fresh flowers in the bathroom, turn down service with mints in the evening, freshly laundered cotton robe and a towelling robe every day… I could go on…Here’s a good tip: We booked only 8 days before we were due to travel. After reading other Trip Advisor reviews regarding the New Otani Discount card, we applied online for one each through their website. Naturally, there was no way that these cards would arrive at our home address within a week. I emailed the hotel directly asking if we could simply use a printout of their email confirmation instead. They sent me a prompt and courteous reply informing us that “Your cards will be waiting for you at reception on arrival”. And indeed they were! Now that’s service. The card is worth getting – there are many benefits, but the two we found most useful were the waiver on some service charges in the hotel restaurants/bars and the free breakfast (beverages, juice and pastries (In the Tower - great morning view of Tokyo). The hotel has many, many posh shops and they are dear, but window shopping is fun! The restaurants and bars are expensive, too. As this trip was my birthday treat, we did eat and drink at the hotel on occasions, and we nearly feinted at the bill, but the experience was worth it.The service we received was faultless. Tipping is not expected; indeed the concept is not really understood. But you will really want to provide a tip – not feel obliged to give one because you feel you have to, as with some other parts of the world…I can’t comment on the gym and pool as we never used them. I have nothing negative to say to say about the hotel. If forced, I would say that it was a bit ‘dated’ but I heard it was due for a facelift.

Subways operate on a ""pay per distance"" policy, so the further you have to go the more you would pay..an average subway ride is 190YEN ($1.90).The Japanese garden located on the grounds of the New otani was spectacular, its something that you must stop and take in if you ever stay at this hotel....its simple amazing you could have such calm in the middle of tokyo.Tokyo and Japan is an awesome place, if you are considering it even in the least...let me tell you, GO...its well worth the (14hr flight) trip.Few places around the New Otani worth visiting.Tokyo Tower -- They boast that its taller than the effel tower in paris...we've been to both and Tokyo tower is taller by an antenna's lenght :-), it is however worth the tripRoppongi district --- this is like New York meets Tokyo...they have everything from TGI Fridays and Applebees to KFC and Wendys...among other US retail stores and such...if you are homesick, you can always re-up in Roppongi. If you are into Dancehall and Reggae music, you can check out this nightclub called ""Club Jamaica"" its located in Roppongi, they have a website as well, google it...its a hole in the wall spot but you will NOT be disappointed, the best marker I can give you is that its next to a 7-11, which is one of the only ones in this district (subway gray or purple line)Akihabara -- Electronics galore, take it from me (Im a hardcore techy geek who spends tons on new gadgets) this place will drive you mad...technology overload, serious gadget lusting. But dont get too caught up in the madness...you can find better priced goods on the Internet. Some products like digicams are reasonably priced and you can get an english manual to most if you just ask (subway gray line)Ueno -- You have got to vist the Ueno Zoo...they have some really unique animals you might not have seen before in teh US. (subway gray or orange line)Cities worth visiting around Tokyo:Yokohama - If you love dancehall and reggae music like I do you need to check out the Yokohama nightlife scene, its incredible, I'm a native borned Jamaican and they were showing ME all the new dances.Kamakura - Ok, we all know Japan is not known for its beaches, but I really enjoyed the beach in Kamakura...something about that black sand the and history behind it makes me proud that I was able to just be a part of that. This city is also very beautiful and worth a few hours just walking around and browsing the local crafts shops. The giant Budda statue is worth the visit, but the 40 YEN to enter the buddah is a total rip (even if its just 40cents)...there is NOTHING to see inside the budda...you climb 4 steps and thats it...a big hollow, empy...nothing!My Best advice for first time travellers is to get an english map of whatever prefectures (cities) you vist, they are always available at the train or bus stations. Secondly, dont be afraid to ask for directions...I was VERY surprised to find that most Japanese speak at least a little english and were more than willing to help us navigate. It helped cause we had a map so we would simply just point to where we needed to go...the ones who couldn't speak english would actually gesture to follow them...they would walk us to where we need to be, bow and walk away, Forget what you heard, there is no such thing as a language barrier in Japan...speak slowly and use proper english and most japaneese will be able to understand and help you. Get a Japan Rail (JR) Pass...if you intend to say in Tokyo and its immediate areas then its useless, however if you decide to take the shinkansen (bullet) trains to other cities like Kyoto or Hiroshima you will need this, or prepare to spend a small fortune on rail transportation. Remember your JR pass does not apply to Nozomi (express) trains or Green Cars (think first class) on any train....also note that all Shinkansen's seats are reserved so you must show your pass and get a seat rez to ride the train. The Narita Express (JR train from Narita Airport terminal 2) will run you about $30 per person to Tokyo station if you do not have a JR pass. Japan Rail and subway systems is sooo simple I only wish New York and other major cities would adopt the same standards.

Although it is not a hip or trendy hotel, it has great rooms (superior room in the Tower was enormous - by any standards) with top views either of the 400-year old garden or the city of Tokyo, is close to the metro and the service is outstanding. All of the staff to a person bent over backwards (er, forwards, actually) to help in every way possible. I had originally booked our first 4 nights through Expedia (at an amazing £74/nt rate) but had not committed to the second leg of our Tokyo trip, as I wasn't sure whether we would want to change areas (maybe to Roppongi). In the end, our stay was so nice, we decided to return for our last 2 nights in Tokyo. When I talked to the front desk, they were very helpful and suggested that if I wasn't happy with the best rate they could offer me (with the New Otani membership I got on their website - get one - it's free and you get discounts), I might want to try to get a better rate on the internet, as I had before. They even offered to let me use the manager's PC, as the business center was closed at that time of night!The only ""complaint"" I have is the hotel is so enormous that it takes about 10 minutes to walk from the main lobby to the Tower (the metro is closer to the Tower entrance, anyhow) and you have to change elevator banks to get to the Tower rooms. But frankly, that is nothing compared to the many benefits of staying there.","London, UK","dalstonuk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, UK</strong>",80,5.0

Our room was bigger than many of our past NYC rooms and came with great amenities -- robes, slippers, toothbrush and toothpaste, razors, soaps, etc. We had plenty of space for our two huge suitcases and all the souvenirs we collected over our week's stay. Plus it was spotless. The hotel was sprawling as well. It contained dozens of restaurants (most unfortunately out of our budget), shopping, a pool, a 400 year garden with adorable koi, and many helpful staff members. We also discovered a secret on their website --sign up for the club card. With membership, you are entitled complimentary breakfast (bagels and juice, more than enough to start your day) and free use of the pool (usually over $30). It also had a classy bar and was very close to the metro stop.

There are plenty of other hotels in Tokyo that are less expensive, in a more centrally located area, and have better amenities.I stayed in the Tower and didn't think it was that great. The room was OK, but I didn't think the overall facilities (either the bar at the top of the Tower) or the bar downstairs were that great. To use the workout facility you had to pay ~$50 USD just for the day. Everything else was similary expensive. The hotel is somewhat convenient located to a train station, but to go anywhere fun other than the Imperial Palace you had to take the subway, which in my book doesn't make the location all that convenient.I specifically picked this place because of its popularity index being #3 for hotels in Tokyo, but I was really disappointed.

While it may be true that the hotel is a bit dated, it certainly is still a grand old hotel. Service throughout this large complex was impeccable; everyone seemed to have a friendly, helpful attitude and I was repeatedly touched by many small acts of kindness. My room in the Tower building had great views of the bustling city below, wonderful linens, and a beautiful bathroom well stocked with high-end toiletries. It was immaculately maintained by housekeeping who seemed to have a sixth sense of when I would be out of the room. The hotel's location is superb; the Akasaka-Mitsuke subway station is a few minute walk (mostly via underground passageway) and provides access to 5 major lines: Ginza, Marunouchi, Hanzomon, Yurakucho, and Chiyoda. The Akasaka district itself has some wonderful dining options including a branch of SushiSei where the remarkably fresh fish and the friendly staff make for an irresistable combination.Yes, prices in the hotel's restaurants, bars, and shops can be high. And I was disappointed that the (great) high speed internet access in my room came with a hefty price tag. But this is a luxury hotel in one of the world's most expensive cities. And there are some tricks. Join the New Otani Club online -- (free) membership provides access to a lounge with complementary coffee, juice, and pastries every morning. Find the AM/PM convenience store in the Garden Court building (part of the hotel complex); you will be glad of it. But if you are going to stay here do not deny yourself some of this wonderful hotel's pleasures. Afternoon tea in the Garden Lounge overlooking the 400 year-old gardens. A drink in the Capri Bar whose amazingly polished bartenders also turned out to be remarkably friendly. And a meal in the revolving restaurant at the top of the Main building. While I've had better Chinese food, and the whole thing turned just a bit too fast for my taste, the views of Tokyo are stunning.

On this most recent trip to Japan I stayed in the New Otani, Park Hyatt, and Park Hotel. I must admit that while the New Otani is a very nice hotel and is certainly ""above average"", it was my least favorite of the three we stayed in.Here is my dilemma using the TripAdvisor system, with only 5-stars to work with and no star increments. The Park Hyatt is clearly in a class by itself. I would give it 6-stars as ""beyond excellent"" but TripAdvisor only offers a maximum of five. Thusly, the Park Hotel, an excellent, chic hotel in a very up and coming section of Tokyo should only receive 4 stars, since it is a clear step down from the Park Hyatt. So then, I am thus relegated to giving the New Otani 3 stars since it is a slight step down from the Park Hotel. Perhaps if I could give half stars it would get 3.5 stars but unfortunately, it cannot reach 4 stars because of the excellent company that I am comparing it to.Onto the hotel. The hotel is obviously quite nice but, as previous reviewers have stated, seems a little dated. It unfortunately cannot yet be called historic but is too old to play with the uber-hotels opened in the last 5-10 years. My tower room was adequately sized, comfortable, and offered a great view of the garden and waterfall, arguably the hotel's best feature. The bathroom in the room, while not luxurious was very well put together. All the fixtures were first-rate, the towels soft and clean, and everything laid out and constructed in an intelligent manner. The room had a slight musty smell to it that was not necessarily bad or overpowering but it was present. It wasn't at all strong enough to put a damper on our stay but it was undeniable.My biggest complaint with the hotel is the price of food and other basic services. I had no problem seeing dealing with the prices at the Park Hyatt, arguably the most expensive hotel in Tokyo, but here it seemed there was no relief. They wanted to charge $50 p/p to use their pool, and there is hardly a restaurant among the 20+ on-site that allows an individual to eat a meal for less that $50.00 p/p. I know Tokyo was recently voted the world's most expensive city, etc, etc, but this kind of annoyed me. I thought La Tour D'Argeant was suitable because of the legendary history behind the Paris branch, but $20.00 for a small piece of cake in their Garden Lounge was a little bit ridiculous. Enjoyable, but way overpriced. On the restaurant front, I recommend walking to to BelleView (I believe that's what it is called) building and eating at Daidaiya. The vibe is super chic, with young waiters in sharp suits, and the food is very creative modern approaches to mainly traditional Japanese cuisine. The Buta Kakuni (Braised Pork Belly w/ skin) was a culinary revelation, and this is someone who defines his life by the memorable meals and dishes he eats.","Oakland, California","Stay62681790095</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",55,3.0

Other restaurants, and there are probably 20 or so in the hotel as a whole, also expensive though there were some good deals for hotel residents.As others have said, the gardens are beautiful, an oasis in a crowded, noisy and polluted city.Short walk to the subway from the hotel and since there's not a lot of attractions (restaurants, bars) in the area this is just as well. Took a while to get out of the hotel complex because it's simply so large. Size also made for anonymity.

An unusual feature was a small TV in there too and the electro-bidet toilet (very Japanese!!) was fun!!Service was excellent and attentive in all areas and the staff make one feel like a celebrity. They all speak excellent English too.

It takes about 10 minutes from the lobby of The Main to walk out via the Garden Court and then the Akasaka Underground Passageway to reach the actual Akasaka-Mitsuke subway station and some of the lines at Nagatacho station were even further, but its pretty straightforward and as the two stations have 5 lines in total it makes it a very good base for exploring.All in all it was the best hotel I have stayed in and would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Tokyo for a holiday.","Lichfield, United Kingdom","Kelvin P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lichfield, United Kingdom</strong>",71,5.0
