This is was not the staffs fault what so ever though! My card was being declined because of the purchase being too great, and there wasn't much I could do because my bank was already closed at this point (I live in SC, it was like Midnight there by the time we arrived for check in). I have major anxiety and after the 15 hour flight day, I was exhausted and an a panic attack was bound to happen at the smallest inconvenience. The staff there was extremely patient with me through my breathing exercises and though I felt like the worst kind of guest to have they never once treated me as such (and I know just how ""fun"" it is to work with a crying customer lol). Once all of that was done and we were finally checked in the room itself was very nice! It was a pretty standard hotel room. Two Queen beds, mini fridge, bathroom ect. But the VIEW was amazing! From our room we would see both the Diamond Head AND Waikiki Beach! Since our clocks were way off we were awake to see the sunrise almost every single day we were there. It was honestly breathtaking. Every day the beds were made, towels replaced, and some goodies left of us on the counter. The house keepers even went as far as to fold some of the cloths we'd left laying around! A bit unusual, but appreciated none the less as I'd never had a place fold our clothes before!We got breakfast vouchers with our room for each morning. The breakfast buffet was a favorite of ours! Each morning we'd go down and be seated with a fresh cup of coffee ready for us. There was just something really nice about sitting in the fresh air with a nice cup of joe to start the day. The buffet had a wide variety of fruits, soups (Yes, SOUP), rice, fish, eggs, bacon, sausage, cereal, juice bar, and even an omelet and waffle OR pancake station. Really it had all the works.The Splash Bar was a good place to relax after our days. The drinks they served were *chefs kiss* (this is internet slang for amazing). The Lava Flow was my go to. It was basically just a sugar slushie with some coconut rum in it but dang it was good. They also served food at the Splash Bar too, my favorite of which was the coconut shrimp. I must have had that shrimp at least 4 times while we were staying there. It was so tasty it stopped me from wanting to to other restaurants!Our check out was at 10am but we weren't going to be picked up to leave the island until around 3pm. The front desk let us check our bags for free so we didn't have to carry them around. Since we didn't have our bags we were able to roam the shopping centers and beach for a while longer before saying goodbye. Would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to the island for the first time.","Summerville, South Carolina","teakwondaughter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Summerville, South Carolina</strong>",1,4.0

Not on the beach, but easy stroll across the street to Waikiki Beach, Kuhio Beach (the same stretch of beach) or Fort Derussy Beach Park (personal favorite). It's not flashy, it's pretty standard Sheraton, but that's all you really need. It's comfortable, clean, very Hawaiian in decor of the open-air reception and public areas, friendly reception staff. Bathrooms are on the smaller side, but do the job. They have proper dresser drawers, which I like, as it's a pet peeve when some of the modern properties don't have enough proper storage space. Pool is nothing special, but I don't hang at the pool when in Waikiki (unless it's the amazing infinity pool at the Sheraton Waikiki!). Room types on the website are pretty clear about which room types have the best views. If in the Tower Ocean King (as I'm in now), request an odd number room, as you can just lazily lay in bed and watch the ocean...it is vacation, after all. That said, I've stayed many times at this property, and even a partial ocean is good.For a hotel not specifically on the beach, and having stayed at so many Waikiki properties over the years, I definitely have no issue recommending the property.","Los Angeles, California","leigh732LosAngeles</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",21,4.0

It was my 5th or 6th stay there and it was excellent as always. Perhaps due to my Marriott Bonvoy silver elite status, even though silver is not a high tier, I was upgraded to a ""Premier Oceanview King"" room in the Ainahau Tower, which had been renovated and had a great lanai with an absolutely stunning view of the ocean. You could sit on the lanai and watch surfers, catamarans and outrigger canoes all day. I find the service at the Princess Kailuani is always exemplary. From the General Manager to the front desk to the room attendants and breakfast buffet staff, they are all hospitality professionals, many of who have worked there for decades, and they provide a friendly and welcoming environment and courteous service. The hotel has a lot of history and has a nice Hawaiian vibe. I know some reviews are not great because of the age of the hotel, and I think the hotel acknowledges that it can be a challenge to keep everything up to standards when they are anticipating closing the hotel in a couple of years for a full makeover.... but they certainly try. Other notes: -The gym is decent and well used and has a nice outlook over the pool.-You get 15% off food bills with Bonvoy membership (any level)Overall, Hawaii hotels are expensive and I find this one to be great value. It's right in the heart of Waikiki and although it's not on the beach, on average you save at least $100US per night compared to even the least expensive beachfront hotel. And the pool desk will lend you beach chairs as well as towels for when you head across to the beach, and they bring bottled water to a designated spot on the beach three times a day. I would recommend the place for sure.",,jlvancouverbc,1,5.0

We were on the 15th Floor with a balcony and ocean view. The rooms are a little tired looking but for the amount of time we spent in the room, it was fine. Because we stayed 8 nights, a complimentary plate of fruit, snacks and drinks was in our room. There was no note it was complimentary but we confirmed it was complimentary when we asked staff. We also had to ask staff for the daily activities available, there was no info on this in the room. We are used to staying in a hotel room that supplies body wash (only had soap), ceramic cups (only had takeaway paper cups), spoons (only had plastic straw stirrers), wine glasses and bottle opener. These little extras make life easier when staying in a hotel. The staff were polite and helpful. I feel communication could be improved either when checking in or in the room to explain the activities/amenities available (no info in room), as well as how the resort charge is applied to your credit card (new charge every day for a different amount). This would have meant us spending less time checking with staff.

We are a family of 6, we have 2 rooms with 2 double beds each room. The beds are so small that our feet stick out of the bed and not comfortable to sleep in. None of us have had a decent night sleep since we got here. From day 1, we got here at 9.30 asked for early check in and got told to go sleep on a banana chair by the pool, till the rooms were ready. I asked if they could please contact me when our rooms are ready as my children were asleep on the banana chairs. We hadn't slept for over 30 hrs as we had an evening flight from australia and had been awake since the day before. They said they could not guarentee it would be ready before 3.00. However I kept going back to fromt desk and at 1.45 1 room was ready. The other not until just after 3. Since then we get woken up most mornings cause housekeeping want to clean our rooms. Why not clean the rooms that want early check in, I don't understand? The toilet has been blocked, they took the shower screen and didn't return it, we had to ask for it back. We have plastic glasses in our bathroom no soaps ect on arrival,the coffee cups are paper cups, what happened to glass? I plugged in the hotel hairdryer and smoke was coming out it's so old, it went red but there was no air coming out. I had to take it outside. What happen to 3.5 star and customer service. I did go down to concierge and ask for queen beds, apparently this hotel only have double or king. $80 extra per room per night for a rollaway. After paying a fortune to stay here and resort fees, I am questioning for what? I don't see anything special about the ""resort"" Nothing is included for the bonvoy marriott members, no breakfast, only a discounted price which is still $23.00 from $28.us dollar $35 Aud, due to the current exchange. I did ask what is the point of being a member when i joined in Fiji 3 years ago and they said breakfast included for adults children 12 yrs under pay child prices. I stayed at the Fiji resort and they were amazing. I have stayed at the sheraton on the park in Sydney a gift to my husband, from friends for his 50th birthday. They were both fantastic service and inclusions, here in waikiki however, I'm finding that their member get no benifits. I would have booked else where had i read the reviews. They take advantage of being under the sheraton umbrella, but they don't seem to have the quality the sheraton is known for.

Definitely not a category 5 hotel as per the bonvoy ratings (more like a Cat 3 hotel in any other city).

Boyfriend and I were in Hawaii for a total of 2 weeks, but decided we were going to adventure around different parts of the island and not stay in one place so we had tried out a handful of resorts each for a few nights. These included: Hyatt Regency Waikiki, Ritz Carlton Residences Waikiki, Marriott Ko’Olina, Turtle Bay North Shore, some were certainly better value / service then others, all of these properties were within range of what I had initially imagined/expected. After searching availability in Waikiki across the Marriott website, for the next 2 nights and finding that most standard rooms in any of the beach front hotels (westin Moana Surfrider, Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton Waikiki) were a 1 queen bed 274 sf ft room facing the back of the building.I am Marriott Platinum, but in the event an upgrade at checkin wasn’t offered to us we really did not wish to be stuck in any of those rooms. Instead we opt to book a slightly larger King room with a balcony in what stated was the newer tower at the Sheraton Princess Kaulani (Marriott category 6). Sheraton is a trusted brand under the Marriott chain that sets high standards for properties representing their brand and holding their name. Marriott category 6 properties for example are the W Hollywood or Lexington NYC to give you an idea for comparison as to what I was expecting this hotel to be like. Booked a KING bed for a 2 night stay as we were in Hawaii on a romantic getaway not teenage backpackers trying to squeeze into the same room and each sleep on our own Twin bed. As a Platinum Elite member , I go to elite checkin desk and she’s claiming she can’t find my reservation , so she’ll go ahead and make a new one. I pulled up the confirmation for her on My phone and she said oh sometimes our systems take awhile (I had booked this Atleast 1.5h prior). Oh well , I let her do her thing and all of w sudden I get a notification on my phone that a new reso has been added which is when I open up the app and realize I now have 2 reservations for the same nights. She says no worries I’m gonna delete one of them and then let’s me know she has us in a 2 twin bed room instead of the king I had actually Booked and on top of that no platinum upgrade to a suite. At this point had the presidential suite been available they should’ve rather put us in that VS this front desk agent sneaking around trying to rebook my reservation into a different bed number because they messed up. While all of this was happening another associate was laying out room keys in envelopes with names on them at least 20 ready to hand out , as a ANA flight had just landed on which they had a handful of guests who were gonna be arriving right away. So hold on, there’s guests that are not even present that you are holding rooms for ? And I am a platinum member , booked an upgraded room and am here present right not But you’re not gonna give me the guaranteed bed options / upgrade I’m entitled to? Tired and realizing it wasn’t going anywhere I just took the 2 twins and we proceeded to go up to our room thinking we were would just push them together or something. My boyfriend laid down on his bed for a total of 5 minutes prior to telling me we were leaving because this place was just not what we expected or had agreed to pay for. So he takes our bags back to the car and tells me he doesn’t even care if we don’t get refunded he’s not staying it’s that bad lol so I go back to the front desk politely let her know we won’t be staying as the 2 twin bed option simply won’t work for us. Instead of apologizing or looking in the system and trying to sort out something or even looking the least bit like she cared would’ve been better then her shoulder shrug and cheerful ok no problem I’ll uncheck you in and not charge, bye now LOL. WTFAs per Marriott’s guaranteed reservation program Platinum members that can’t be accommodated are entitled to a $200usd compensation AND 90000 points and the hotel is supposed to pay for your accommodations that night at a nearby property. She didn’t offer any of that and we were left to search for places ourselves drove around for an hour prior to finally finding the Laylow autograph collection, another Marriott. As soon as we arrived the agent was so cheerful and pleasant and just genuinely thankful for our business and welcoming. Such nice staff at Laylow , all marriotts actually. This whole Sheraton behaviour really shocked me. Which is why I do not believe this property deserves to be a Sheraton or be a part of Marriott’s chain. I hope someone from head office sees this and can address the issues with them personally / send in a site audit.

Check in was fast and easy. They provide you with a handheld wifi device that basically gives you access to free wifi all over the downtown strip. Check in staff had arranged to surprise my mother with sweets and a bottle of champagne the day of her birthday. Parking was $25 US a day, which you paid at the end once you’ve checked out of the hotel. Beautifully located on the Waikiki strip. Everything was within walking distance (beach, malls, restaurants). It was very busy with lots of tourists during the day and was safe to walk alone at night. Room- we stayed in a city view double room. The furniture seemed a little dated but the room itself was very clean. Bathroom was simple, a little small but clean. The balcony over looked the strip with a partial view of the ocean. Pool was a little small and would be quite busy with lots of families/little kids, very limited seating/lounge chairs were available. The pool closed a little earlier than I had hoped for, around 6pm. There’s a cocktail bar/restaurant by the pool. They had drink specials for the day and would provide seaweed dusted popcorn with each drink purchase. Overall the hotel itself was nothing special.

DUI assessment few times over if you are a loyalty member they are not afraid to upgrade you. I got upgraded to the top floor. And instead of getting bonus points if you are a loyalty member you can choose to get breakfast which is a $28 Buffet. The good deal. Let's start with the buffet it is a good mix of your normal hot breakfast items as well as some of the local items. They do have an omelet bar. All of this is included in the price or free if you chose to get the breakfast instead of the points. They do have waitresses that will serve you drinks. Is a very nice little restaurant in area 2 that opens up to the pool it is kind of indoor outdoor. The service here is second to none. Whether it's the front desk the cleaning crew or the people in the bars and restaurants they are all very professional but also very friendly. Did you have a nice pull probably one of the nicest ones on the Strip. It has easy access to the main strip in Waikiki. And it's right across the street from the beach. The upper floors have great views of the ocean. They do have on-site parking garage about $35 a day. Not a bad deal for Waikiki. The rims have great Linens and are very modern and up-to-date. They are very spacious and they also have balconies. The upper floors have some great views of downtown Waikiki. They also have high-end toiletries. Egg location of this as perfect as I said it's on the strip and right across from the beach.

This hotel is old and the rooms need updating but it is clean and comfortable. The staff are friendly and helpful. The best attraction about this hotel is the location, it is fantastic, short walking distance to all the good restaurants, shops and the beach. If breakfast isn't included it was $30 per person a day which is incredibly expensive but there are many places to get a good cheap breakfast just a few minutes walk away. The Splash Bar located in between the lobby and the pool is awesome and so easy to grab good quality, not too expensive meals and drinks especially in their happy hours. There is nearly always some form of music or live entertainment going on around the Spash Bar and pool which can be nice but can also be annoying if you are trying to rest in your room as the sound travels up and is quite loud but it does add to the Hawaiian atmosphere so you tolerate it.

When we arrived to check in at roughly 630 pm there was no line at the desk. Two staff members were working with two customers though. We wait for roughly 15 minutes. At this point there were roughly 8 people waiting in line behind me. A third staff member came out from behind the counter asked if we were trying to check in then apologized for the long wait and said we would be helped shortly. At this point one customer was finishing up. A new customer walked up in the important person line. As the first customer finished I walked up to the counter. I was told she could not help me she had to help the person that just walked up. I pointed out how long I had been waiting and one staff member had apologized. I was told I would not be helped and I had to wait in line. I returned to line and was finally checked in after roughly 45 minutes total wait time.Upon check in I asked for two wine glasses could be sent to my room. I was told they could not help me with that and I needed to call from my room to the operator and request them. Getting to the room everything was clean from what we could see however the AC was not turned on and the room must have been close to 80 degrees. Before leaving for dinner I called like I was directed and asked for wine glasses to be sent up. I informed them we were going out to dinner. They asked permission to leave them in my room which I gave them. When we return from dinner the room had cooled off but there were no wine glasses left in the room. We were gone for roughly two hours. I called again and was told the staff is busy and they would be up as soon as they could. We planned to sit on the balcony, which we paid to have a nice view from, and enjoy a very nice $100 bottle of wine for our anniversary. We were forced to drink the wine out of either the bottle or the cheap paper coffee cups they leave in the rooms. Needless to say neither was a good choice and we choose to save the bottle. Over all my point is the customer service of the hotel is extremely lacking and needs to be fixed. There are dozens of hotels in the same price range in Waikiki. We clearly chose the wrong one.

I know the hotel is older and probably ready for some renovations, so I was a little nervous when I booked my room. I’m a Titanium Bonvoy member and used my rewards for an upgrade and started in the larger suite room. It looked exactly like the pictures online- only the view and the size were better than expected. It was so spacious. The customer service was really great. The staff send a bday cupcake up to my 16yr old on our second day. The breakfast by the pool was amazing. It’s the best breakfast perk I’ve had at a Marriott chain. The resort fee is better than most in Waikiki. Last time I was there I paid the same resort fee at a different hotel- all it had was a tiny pool, a couple of beach toys and a redbox machine. I’ve read other comments on here complaining about the resort fee. Pretty much every hotel charges a resort fee in Hawaii & it’s known before booking. Honestly, the water, beach chairs and gorgeous pool area with entertainment was worth it. I was disappointed they couldn’t honor the 4pm check-out time, especially since I’m a titanium but it wasn’t a big deal. They held my luggage and we had a great last day walking around Waikiki.

My husband and I stayed here for a week last month. We normally stay at the other (“nicer”) Sheraton near the Royal Hawaiian and were disappointed when they were booked and we had to “settle” for this one. Can I just tell you that the staff completely and utterly went above and beyond my expectations by providing the utmost in extraordinary service?? It’s been some time so I’m hoping to remember some of the staff by name. Here goes..The two front desk ladies are spectacular! Love love love these two! Their customer service is completely outstanding and they made such a wonderful impression on us. They were kind, funny, accommodating and patient even though my husband made it a point to bug them several times per day (thanks for hydrating us!). Hahah. I believe their names are Erin and Sharen. I should have written this down. Both of these wonderful women have such a good vibe about them and truly stood out!! They made sure to it that our stay was amazing and it sure did work. And a shout out to Gingerlee, at the egg station, who accommodated my strange request of cheese with a little bit of egg. Lol. She’s awesome and she knows egg-xactly how to prep your eggs/omelettes just the way you like them! The hotel itself isn’t as pretty or fancy as the other ones. It’s pretty basic and tucked away off a side street. It’s still within walking distance to everything so that wasn’t a problem. The view wasn’t great and the rooms were a bit outdated. I felt like I was in the Brady Bunch episode where they went to Hawaii. But I hear they’re going to upgrade the rooms so that should be nice. If you’re okay with a decent room, come here.

Upon getting to the room it was of decent size for what we paid. The furniture definitely needs a retouch of sanding and paint or needs to be replaced. The cabinet containing the mini fridge was too difficult to open. It got stuck every time I tried to open it and then open the fridge.One of my main concerns came when I sat on the bed and the mattress popped up (rm 811). I am a man of size, 6'2"" 300 lbs to be exact but I have never had a bed mattress pop in the air to my recollection (It certainly did not at the Westin LAX where we stayed the night before coming to you. The beds were amazing. I chose them because of the great stay I had at the Westin ATL Airport a few months back). After I assessed, the bed frame is actually a double or a full and the queen mattress hangs over the bed on both sides. I did not make a big deal because we were only there for 2 days but we had to make sure not even to lean on the bed’s edge while sleeping or we would have slid off and I am not exaggerating. I ask that you really take care of that issue because someone could get hurt.Moreover, the bathroom in the room was the nicest/newest thing. As for how to turn on the shower, I had to call the front desk to receive instructions on how turn on the shower. I travel extensively. Not a great design choice. The lady that serviced our room was so nice. Shout out to Miss Helen! Thank you.The second concern I had was with the amenity fee. I have no problem paying a resort/amenity fee if what is listed is provided. There were no activities listed for Saturday and Sunday which makes people who book for the weekend feel less appreciated. There was no time listed for ukele and Lai making lessons. When I asked the agent said it happens at the other Sheraton property down the road. I should not have to walk to another hotel unless I have a room to recline in at that hotel in addition to my room at your property. I asked about the fruit at the pool and at the beach. I was told that they bring fruit out at 11, 1 and 2, that was also not on the paper. I looked for fruit at the pool when we went out for the day on Saturday at 11am, none was present, only fruit infused water (not the same as fruit). I was at Waikiki beach and nobody from the hotel was out there with towels, fruit or water asking for Sheraton guests in the section where they said they are supposed to be. It just does not happen and the hotel knows that. The pool concierge were friendly though.Upon check in I was not offered a go pro or the wireless device but I saw them in the display case. What is the stipulation to use them, must a card be swiped for that as a deposit? Never got an answer from management.I want to emphasize that I DID NOT ask for a room move, an upgrade, dinner or breakfast, I am not that kind of person. I just want to get what I am paying for. I EMAILED THE this same statement to a Brian Hashimoto 4 days ago as a courtesy, but he has not responded. Perhaps he was on vacation. I give this property a 2.9 star rating because the carpet in public areas and in the room needs to be replaced. The staff members are all friendly and they outshine the sketchy amenity fee.","Queens , New York, United States","izzyscott_intL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Queens , New York, United States</strong>",1,3.0

Let’s start with the positives... The hotel is very close to the beach, and is a short walk from probably over 100 restaurants. The view from our room on the 20th floor was wonderful (we were fortunate enough to have the corner room). The hotel offers a large continental breakfast which is free if you have a high enough status with Marriott. The check in process was terrific, as was the entire staff during our 10-day stay. The room was plenty spacious and the bed was comfortable. There is a pool and a poolside bar/restaurant on site which many people seem to like. Pretty much everything is clean. The WiFi has been reliable throughout our stay. And now for the neutral facts... The hotel has a parking garage connected to it, which is $35/day. The hotel also charges a daily resort fee of over $30/day as well, which includes several amenities (including the ability to check out towels to take to the beach), though is not quite worth the cost. They also offer a dinner buffet every night for $35/adult. They have a Polynesian-themed dinner show onsite for $100+, which is a pretty standard rate, it seems. And now the negatives... the four elevators were slow. I often had to wait more than a minute for an elevator, and a couple times I waited for five minutes. Maybe I’m spoiled, but I’m used to getting elevators in seconds, not minutes. The hotel itself could use some renovation; it clearly shows some wear and tear from the years of business.

The hotel staff were so polite and accommodating and stopped at nothing to ensure my dad and I had nothing but excellent and professional service. As our flight arrived early in the morning and check-in wasn't for at least 5 hours, the gentlemen at the front desk arranged our bags to be taken and provided us with a temporary key to access hotel amenities while we waited. Not only did he ensure we were notified every step of the way, but he placed us on a priority list to arrange my dad and I a room ASAP. As a result, we got a room at 12:30 pm instead of 3pm, which made the start of the trip so much easier, especially after 10 hours of flying. The Pool staff and staff at Splash bar were such a treat, my dad and I looked forward to going to splash bar every day of our trip for a happy hour drink and meal. It was such a nice place to hide from the sun and refresh ourselves. What made it even better was the professionalism and service of the staff. They were so friendly and loved to chat. A special mention to Herbert, and his awesome bartending skills. The boys and girls running the pool desk were so friendly and helpful during our staff and offered us amazing tips and places to visit while on Waikiki beach.The housekeeping staff did an amazing job every day, making sure coffee and bottled water were replenished as well as making sure we came back to a cleanroom. A major feature we loved about staying at the Sheraton is the Bonvoy discounts and ability to room charge at other Marriot hotel chains nearby. It saved me bringing credit cards and cash to the beach when I could instead go straight to Moana Surfrider and charge to my room. The only criticism I have is the $35 a day parking rate. As my dad and I stayed in a room each and was both paying a $33 a day resort charge, the added cost of parking did manage to eat into our travel budget and prevent us from partaking in some activities. We were wondering why parking wouldn't be included in the resort charge or at least a little cheaper, as renting a car in itself is already a significant investment.Other than the parking charges, the stay was really amazing and a huge thank you to all the staff for their excellent service and friendliness.","Melbourne, Australia","Amara_56</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",31,5.0

I have to say, the Princess Kaiulani really won me over! Are the rooms tired? Yes, absolutely. And I don't see that improving in the next couple of years, because while I was there, Marriott had posted a sign indicating they intend to apply for a permit to tear down the Princess Kaiulani in the next couple of years to build a huge tower hotel complex on the site. (An employee there said they had been told it would be closing in two years for that project.) But if that happens, I for one will miss the old-school, mid-century vibe of the SPK as it is! The location is unbeatable, right on Kalakaua Ave, a half block from the public park where the Duke Kahanamoku statue stands on Waikiki beach. The pool is fantastic -- one of the bigger pools we saw in Waikiki, and saltwater too! Lots of seating around the pool, and live music and entertainment during happy hour. We loved it! The Splash bar was great for post-dinner drinks: more live music, good bar lighting (some of the Waikiki bars seemed TOO brightly lit!) and a great vibe.The service was spectacular. All the employees I interacted with were friendly, attentive to detail and helpful. I so appreciated the upgrade to a partial ocean view room, the birthday cheesecake they left in the room, and the lei I was given upon check-in! Pros: *Great location*Large saltwater pool with lots of seating*Friendly, attentive service*Live music and entertainment at happy hour and post-dinner*Great value for Waikiki*Comfy bedsCons:*Dated rooms*Poolside rooms can be a little loud (pool closes at 7, but live music near the pool happens until 11)","Chicago, Illinois","anne_shesfancy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",49,4.0

The manager Brian, was very dismissive and curtly stated that: "" I should have booked directly with the hotel and that we can move you to another room but it will be in the same booking category."" The toilet in the room (525) was dirty and malfunctioning. To their credit, housekeeping did come up to clean the toilet, but we were exhausted and declined their gesture. The manager Robert, was very helpful in submitting a work order the next morning to have our toilet repaired. I was very disappointed that a member of their guest services team did not proactively contact us to improve our experience. My perception was that; because I used a thirty party booking system (Priceline) that my request was not a priority. I literally had to go down to the front desk the first 4 days of our vacation to inquire if a room with a view/balcony had become available.

The wallpaper was cracked and peeling in the bathroom and there was some sort of damage on the ceiling that appears to have been hastily repaired.

The furniture appears VERY used. As you can clearly see from the photo the broken door on the TV cabinet was very dirty and grimy. Also, beware that on top of your room rate you will be charged a $34 per day “Resort Fee” and you will also pay more to park your car than it cost to rent your car.

Was a business trip, not vacation. We've also stayed at other Honolulu properties in the Marriott family and reviewed those on this site. We had a very good stay, based upon what we paid. For context, our rate included the breakfast buffet each morning and waived the resort fee.Pro's: - Friendly staff. All staff we encountered were very friendly and positive. Front desk as especially welcoming, including a complementary lei. - Room was nicely clean and orderly. Everything worked just fine. - Was part of our room rate...the breakfast buffet was quite impressive. A very large variety of foods, well-prepared. Omelet station, eggs, bacon, sausage, waffle, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, Asian breakfast items...and I'm sure we missed things. Quite a large spread. Our guess is it would retail at about $25 a head on Waikiki. - WiFi worked fine too. - Location is great. Across the street from Mona Surf Rider, diagonally across the street from Waikiki Beach. Nicely, not on Kaulakau Ave, so there is some buffer from all the street noise. Other notes, which some may find a bit of a detractor: - For us, the $35/night resort fee would have been a deal breaker. The photos tell the story about the pool. Frankly, we didn't see anything we'd term ""resort"". It's a nice Waikiki Beach hotel.  - The rooms are about due for a refresh. Everything was clean and functional, yet if one seeks bright and sparkling, marble countertops, new furniture, etc, that's not SPK. For us, it was fine. - We read the comments on noise. We were in the original/shorter tower (building that contains the front desk). We found the sliding door to the lanai did a good job minimizing noise from the pool area, including the live music in the evening. Yet, the walls are a bit thin; we could hear the guys next door pretty clearly. We usually have business in Honolulu about once a year. We'll certainly consider SPK for our return business, and the decision will hinge upon the value. If it's what we experienced this year, sure, we'll be back. If that resort fee sneaks back in, probably will pass for the Marriott property that doesn't have one.","Yorktown, Virginia","FJVLS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorktown, Virginia</strong>",148,4.0

She did get the bread but the waitress made out she was doing some very big special request to the chef. And then after being offended and feeling like you want to cry they expect a tip.

A great member of staff during both my visits was Floyd, a bellman. Does the hotel proud.The bad on both stays. The exorbitant resort fee. Honestly giving me 2 bottles of water a day and the promise of maybe getting some service at the beach does not come to +$30. A big rip-off in my view. The lack of “greenness” of this property. Plastic cups everywhere, toiletries still in small individual containers ( and new containers provided every day despite me still having plenty in the open ones). I would honestly prefer toiletries in dispensers and only paper cups if. They cannot provide glass/ceramic.My first stay I had a partial ocean facing room in the second wing. The room was large with two “king” beds and a lovely balcony. The issue I had with this stay was the staff. My checkin and checkout were awful ( checkin probably a lot worse).On my second stay I was allocated a city view room in the Princess tower. Elevators were slow ( appears only 2 of the 3 were working) and the room was TINY! This time I only had a single “king” bed ( two people cannot comfortably fit into this bed so am glad I was travelling on my own). The TV blocked my access to the window and honestly was not worth the money charged ( cost me more than the first room!). This time again had an awful checkin with the young man telling me “ you are lucky we are letting you have the room early”, 1.5 hours before the official checkin.

My boyfriend and I arrived a little early before check in time and they were still able to check us in. The room itself once we got there was very clean. The hotel also gives 2 free water bottles per day and a water station where you can refill your water so that definitely saved us some money! By the pool you can find more water bottles and some fruits as well! The hotel also offered free beach towels and beach chairs which really came in handy! Right next to the pool was a small little coffee shop that was nice to go to in the morning. Every worker was always smiling and so welcoming at the hotel! Another great thing about this hotel was the amazing buffet! We ate at the dinner buffet on a Saturday night and who can say no to all you can eat crab and prime rib!? Amazing! One main reason I’m giving this place 4 stars is because of the time the pool closes. I’m not sure how late other pools are open until around the area, but I just personally feel that 7:00pm is a little early to be closing the pool especially since the sun is barely setting at that time during Spring. I would’ve loved to end my nights by the pool like I did in past hotels on other islands, but I missed that experience here. Unfortunately, I didn’t step in the pool once in my week long stay since my boyfriend and I were constantly exploring the island and shopping outlets until it was dark. And although the beach chairs are free, returning by 6pm is super early since sunset is around 6:30-7pm during spring time. Keep in mind that parking can also be a bit pricey at $35/day, and sometimes the lot can get full. Fortunately my boyfriend and I got lucky with parking every night but there were some nights where we only saw a couple spots left!Other than that, I had a wonderful stay! Thank you!

Let's talk about the location first, it's close to the main road, loads of resturtant and bars around, beach is by walking distance, airport is like 20-30 mintues around, depends on the traffic. And if you been to Guam, this Sheraton is exactly the same, there's big balcony in every room. As a platimum member, you may expect a room upgrade to suite, but during Christmas period, I think it's impossible. So I got a basic room with a partly ocean view, not exactly the corner room though. So for the room itself, I won't say it speciaous unless you count the balcony as well. The decoration is very old-fanshioned and basic, nothing fancy, so if you are here for a honeymoon, you better pick another Sheraton that located at the beach, surly the time is two times higher during holiday. And there's not much amienty in toliet, you may ask them though. And I'd say the breakfast is the highlight for first few days, but the last day totally ruin our impression. We still here til boxing day and everybody looks so upset and grumpy that morning, we try to ask for coffee, but all the staff just keep ignoring us or pretend they didnt notice us. After 20 mintues we finally get the coffee. For the breakfast, it's baisc western choices, bacon, egg and sausage. And like every corner in Hawaii, you would find rice and soup as well.In short, if you coming here in the peak season like Christmas, don't expect quick service and don't expect much. The only best thing here is the location.

(Please check the two pictures I am attaching). The location of the hotel is great, and the people working there are doing their best to make their customer feel special. The owner is probably making so much money (the room was not cheap), that he has not reason to tear down the property and build a new one (I am afraid that given the state of the hotel, this is all they can do). So the location is good, and the staff is up to par. But they are many other hotels in the area, the other Sheraton is not far, and there is a Westin managed property accross the street...so if you are a fan of Starwood or Marriott hotels, treat yourself to an experience you deserve.

I was also incredibly relieved to hear that I could get a room at 11:00 AM, which is a bit earlier than the normal check-in time. However, I did make this request known to the hotel several days in advance via e-mail, and also via the Marriott web-check-in service. As usual, the front desk has no record of this communication.The room:I booked an ocean view king room, and received exactly the same thing. I was expecting something better as a Platinum elite, but didn't receive any upgrades. Perhaps I should be happy because I was allowed to check-in early? I don't know... would have been nice to be given the choice.Parking:I had parking charged to the room, and the front desk issued a parking permit to show upon exiting the parking garage. Nobody told me I was supposed to have kept the original parking ticket issued by the machine, and I was royally chewed out by the ridiculous parking staff lady upon my first exit from the garage. She demanded my drivers license and recorded down all of my information. I wonder where all of that went?The Bill:The rate that I reserved included a $25 credit that could be used for anything at the hotel (with the exception of the resort fee, which of course, is absolutely ridiculous and should be waived for elite members, but that's another story...)Upon check-out, I was told that the $25.06 charge I had at the bar had not posted to my account, but not to worry, once it did, they would automatically waive the $25.00 leaving me with a $0.06 balance charged to my card.No surprise, the next day I see a revised bill with the ENTIRE $25.06 charged to my room, and also this charge posted to my credit card account.Post Service:My bad, I left a cell phone charger in the room. Let my mistake be notice to anyone staying at this hotel: it is a HUGE hassle to get anything back, so please be careful and do not leave anything behind.This hotel has a lost and found department that has banker's hours, e.g. they are only available during weekdays, during bank hours. You will not get your stuff back during the weekend.I reported my loss in person at the hotel the next day, and was told to simply pick up the ""house phone"" and ask for lost and found. Seriously.. I went physically back to the hotel during business hours and had to pick up a phone! How ridiculous is that!The guy took my info. and said he would call me back if they found anything.

Many of them are old and lack the amenities/polish of newer hotels, but they charge insanely high prices due to their location. The SPK is an old hotel, and if you go to most major cities, you wouldn't consider it a ""4 star"" hotel relative to other 4-star hotels. But for hotels on Waikiki Beach, the SPK is pretty comparable to everything else out there, and it costs WAY less than most of its competition.So here are the details from my early January 2019 trip - rooms are pretty old and small. No real way around it. The swimming pool is tiny compared to the pool at the nearby Sheraton Waikiki. Unlike some other hotels, it's not directly on the beach but you have to cross the street and go half a block to reach the sand. But, everything is reasonably clean and neat. The hotel buffet is pretty good and less expensive compared to other hotels in the area. The location is fantastic - there are lots of great restaurants and stores in the immediate vicinity. The hotel lobby is also pretty spacious, so there's a lot of room for little kids to run around and amuse themselves while their tired parents sip on a tropical drink.For Marriot/SPG elite members, know that there's no club on the property.

We didn't know it at the time but this was a great deal in the Waikiki area. Kids get breakfast for free, 2 bottles of water and a fruit everyday are complimentary with the resort fee which was waived.CHECKIN: Very pleasant, Jason thank you! Gave us a great room with no neighbors on the 22nd floor in the Tower. Fumbled with waiving the resort fee but got the job done with some young manager. Sent a person to help with the luggage, who delivered all our 9 bags to the room! Kids were given a candy necklace which they enjoyedROOM: 22nd floor with a view of waikiki beach, the pool and the road, good but not as good as the Moana or the other Sheraton. Big enough to fit a family of four, central AC works good. Glass sliding door allows some road noise, need some ear putty for a good sleep. We had no immediate neighbors and could not hear any noise from within the hotel!! TV had netflix (that was all we needed), WiFi was fast. The fridge was standard beverage cooler, small but fit a couple wine bottles, food and some milk.RESTROOM/BATHROOM: There was a leak in the tub which was not fixed, no fans and the floor was not very clean. The person that has remodeled the bathroom has done a very poor job. BREAKFAST: Pretty good. Scrambled eggs, omlette station, potates, meats, Asian options and regular bread and other baked goodies. Coffee served at your table. There were a bunch of birds picking up leftovers and another bunch of rude employees chatting at the front and doing nothing. You had to present two coupons for two adults if you booked the room with breakfast, else you pay $30 per adultKIDS: Couldn't eat breakfast without the coupoun or use the pool without adults. The staff is also quite grumpy with children, this hotel is not a good option if you have high energy kids. ROOM SERVICE AND PERKS: Very good, you get extra blankets, hair products, curling irons etc. We also got the gopro camera for free but make sure you have an SD card (we used our phone SD card) else it costs $30 to buy an SD card. You get free beach towels and chairsPARKING: $35 a day which has to be paid upon checkin and spots are always available, if you are in the tower, park higher and you can access the elevator from the 4th floor. There are no elevators in the parking lot. You do have to keep your payment receipt for parking else you get charged $50 and this receipt has to be presented each time you leave, irritating but understandable. Parkling lot access is through a very small road, so it works if you have a subcompact or a small car. LAUNDRY: $5 to was $5 to dry 45 minutes, $3 for detergent. Very expensive but does a decent job. No laundry bags provided. MICROWAVE: $10 per day to rent, but we were not chargedCONCLUSION: This is a very good option if you are staying in Waikiki. Great value if you can escape the resort fee and get a breakfast option. Behind the scenes, management is working hard to improve your experience",,rxrankings,12,4.0

I will get that out of the way first then I can actually review the properly on its merits.So most of the food venues were closed, housekeeping was intermittant and a lot of the usual services were not in operation. This I could deal with, everything was avaliable such as amenities, towels, but you just had to get them yourself. The tough part was the noise of the protestors. My anger is not at the hotel for this, rather the union and the local police. The started as early as 5.50am banging pots and pans and chanting and it went on until 10pm at night. The hotel compensated with no resorts fees and a few other things thrown in. All of the staff we dealt with were pleasant and tried their best. I found Melanie to be very pleasant even though she was there everyday listining to the compliants! But the noise was really hard to get past. You couldnt sit on your balcony and relax because the noise was just too much. The police just stood by and watched the protestors be rude to people, chanting that they will not stop the noise until they get their contracts. This is uterly disrespectful to all people that have saved to go on holidays, celebrate milestones and have downtime. Their beef is with the hotel, yet they contiue to affect the whole of the Waikiki area and all of those people that dont deserve their holidays to be affected. All I can say is they are not doing themseleves any favours by being rude, noisy and generally disrepectful to the public. Now I can comment on the hotel....The hotel has a bit of a 70's Hawaiian feel, could do withsome upgrades but overall its got a good vibe too it. We stayed in an Oceanview Room, these do have a great view over Waikiki. The rooms itself is a little small but acceptable. The bathrrom is a bit crowded also and didnt have any sheleves to store your toiletries on. The room was a little dusty, not sure if this was from the labour strike or just that it needs a little bit of love. The double beds were a bit saggy and small. Pillows were flat and lifeless!We ate at the breakfast buffet and I am sure there were some diferences from the stike but overall the tables were cleared regulary, the food selection was good, the line up for omletes was a long. For a American hotel breakfast it was good. I did find the platic plates and cultery a bit odd but I am hoping thats because of the labour strike.The pool area was really quaint, pool isnt large but I never found it over crowdered. The sun lounges were comfy and you also never had to look too hard for one. They played Hawiian music around the pool which was really nice, maybe a little louder than usual to drown out the protesters! The guys that manned the pool area were really nice. They had beach chairs, water, icy poles, sunscreen and were always helpful when you asked for something.The rating that I have given is largely to the location. This is a great spot to be able to walk to the beach, shops and great resturants. The pricing on this hotel is pretty good compared to a lot of the ther beachfront properties that charge for location. On this stay I didnt need to pay the resort fee but if I had of it really brings down the value of the property. The resort fees are really a waste, what you get is not worth what you pay and I really feel the hotel would have a lot more people happy with the property if this charge wasnt added.The beach chairs can be bought at the ABC store, no childrens gift was given at checkin, the only things that really have a value are the bottles of water (once again can be cheaply bought at ABC) and the wireless interest (which was never even offered).Based on location, price and generally being a pleasant hotel I would stay here again....lets hope with no protestors though!

We had booked a pool view room, but were told these rooms did not have a balcony! As we had requested a room with balcony, we were allocated a room in the ""tower"". Poor choice- our room overlooked a concrete wall from the adjoining International Marketplace, and the constant loud noice from the air conditioning units and exhaust fans on the roof, were worse than the chants from the protestors! At least the protestors ceased at about 10pm, but the noise of the loud air conditioners went on 24/7. After 2 nights, we asked to be moved to a quieter room. We requested a tower room, overlooking the pool, but were told there weren't any available as the hotel was "" fully booked"".

I just want polite staff & a clean room. Neither are here due to the employee strike & one has to wonder how much Sheraton/Marriott are just hoping this will fizzle out.We arrived Sunday & there was no word or warning that 6AM the next day, the hotel staff would go on strike. The hotel has a duty of care to inform guests of disruptions as they become aware of them. The negotiations have been ongoing since June, 4 months now & incoming guests should've been given an opportunity to book somewhere else, now we're stuck for another 4 nights still & cannot rebook because every other hotel now is on rack rates due to the 5 hotels now emptying nearby.We're in a room we paid extra for a view, that has not been updated in 20 years. I thought the Sheraton name was 5-Star (though relooking trips advisor has them at 3.5 star). AND... we still need to pay for the resort fee. Resort fee? What? This is a hotel near the beach, not a resort. Why is this not in the fee I paid when I booked the package through Expedia?Here is a few of my gripes:- Limited staff at check-in, though the next day there was no staff due to strike- We arrived early (12 noon), room not ready which we expected & we're dragging our own bags around the lobby. I suggest that the hotel should take bags to your bell desk not reception & then the bags could've been put in the room as soon as it became available. Instead, we had to dig out a bag tag before the receptionist would then send the bags up- ""I'll be helping you to check in today..."" was what the receptionist said. I know this, I am standing in front of you- Wallpaper is falling off the walls & is dirty- Lifts are being turned off regularly & the lift on the left (out of 3) has only opened once since we've been here causing lines & overcrowding- Pool closed one day due to no staff- Housekeeping closed with our room not cleaned now 5 days with 4 to go. Yes, we are staying near the beach & tracking in sand every day. So yummy- Collecting our own towels & toiletries from the lobby- Woken every day around 6 AM when the protesters start banging drums. This morning they were so loud, my bed was vibrating- No restaurants or food available. Though on the first night, we were served a cocktail by the most loveliest lady, I wish I got her name- Ugly bins in the floors to deposit our own rubbish- Toilets near the gym are those non-water ones in the urinals & now 5 days in without cleaning, are starting to reek. Don't go in, be warned!The most upsetting part is the hotel management. What are they doing during this crisis, & yes it is a crisis to make the stay as comfortable as possible for those guests sticking it out? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We can hear the protesters with the doors closed 24/7& they block the entrances & intimidate the people coming in & out with DON'T CHECK IN, CHECK-OUT! I've even seen them taunting cars driving in to turn around & go somewhere else. We've got nowhere else to go guys.","Sydney, Australia","devildude</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",26,1.0

Forget about opening your window to enjoy a sea breeze, that won't happen unless you want to hear the screaming protesters.. But bring your cleaning skills as it will become part of your holiday fun. Start with making the bed, emptying rubbish but there will be no clean sheets. Get your own towels but be quick as you don't want to miss out. There is no bar open or restaurant so I suggest to bring your own alcohol and food to get through the day. But you will get a resort fee refund - so if you can persevere you could save a few dollars, plus you save a fortune in Tips as there is no service staff. Here are some pictures of the towel bins when we were a bit late to get our towels. My tip is to get there early and grab as many as you cAn so this doesn't happen to you.

I was very excited about using my reward points for the first time and to be taking my mom on her first trip to Hawaii.I booked my reservation via the SPG website for 3 adults in a room with 2 double beds at the Sheraton Princess Kauilani. A total of 140,000 points were redeemed for 5 nights (4 nights with 1 free night) and $172.75 in resort fees ($35/daily). The reservation was for Jan 2019 which is nearly 5 months out. I was pleased to see that I had just enough points to be able to book the hotel stay. I then purchased the airline tickets right afterwards on my SPG Amex card.Checked my account the next day under ""MyTrip"" on the SPG website to forward a copy to my sister. To my shock & dismay, apparently, my confirmed reservation was TAMPERED with and it showed 1 king bed instead of the 2 double that was originally booked. To make matters worse, I was slapped with $400 'extra person' charge ($80/day) which was never included in the original confirmation that showed only the resort fee of $172 but no charge for additional person when I reserved it for 3 adults. All these changes were made (by the hotel) after my reservation was already confirmed and made without me even being informed of any changes. My anxiety level shot through the roof when I saw the additional $400 charge since I had already purchased non-refundable airline tickets. Luckily, I had made saved copies of the original confirm reservation. It allowed me to compare the differences and note what was changed so I could report it. I called SPG member services and spent nearly an hour on the phone with the representative at SPG. She called the hotel directly to checkout the discrepancies. I was informed that a staff at the hotel had made changes to my 'confirmed' reservation from 2 double beds to 1 king bed because I had made a comment under the ""special request section"" of my reservation for an ""Accessible Room if possible"" to accommodate my mom in a wheelchair. Initially, I was informed by the SPG rep that the hotel stated that they didn't have ""accessible rooms"" with double beds which was why our room was switched from 2 double beds to 1 king and that the hotel is not aware of the added $400 charge. (Bogus! ) Also, you would think that such a drastic change from 2 double beds for 3 adults to 1 king bed for 3 adults would require some sort of notification or email by the hotel to the customer. But none was sent to me at all.When I inquired further why a $400 extra person charge was added to an already 'confirmed reservation' at a fixed rate of $172, the SPG rep indicated that she couldn't see the charges on their end in the system and that the hotel could not see it on their system either even though it was clearly evident under the SPG website under ""MyTrip"" reservation. I offered to send both the SPG rep and the hotel staff via email copies of both the original confirmed reservation showing only $172 in charges and the tampered reservation showing $572 in total charges with 3 adults. Eventually, after further discussion with the hotel by the SPG rep, it was discovered that indeed there were ADA accessible rooms with 2 double beds and that we would be putting us in those with the $400 fee for additional person charge removed since we were using SPG points and the SPG points does not charge for the additional 3rd person. To put a smoke screen in all of this by the reps, I was informed that it was a coding error by the hotel since they have only one code for 'ADA accessible rooms' for king bed and the hotel does not have another code for the 'ADA accessible' double bed rooms which completely makes no sense at all since inventories of rooms are tracked meticulously by hotel staff.The SPG rep assured me that she would add notes in my account to make sure that we are given an ADA room with 2 double beds with no additional $400 charge for the extra 3 person.What really upsets me in all of this and what I have learn:a) Hotel staff can tamper with a 'confirmed reservation' and change what you have agreed to purchase ""after"" the agreement is already made without your consent.Lesson learn: Save all documention immediately following your original reservation so you have a backup copy of what you 'agree' to purchase.b) Double check everything before your trip so you don't have problems such as this issue at check-in which would be a nightmare scenerio especially when traveling with a disable elderly person.c) Find a reputable hotel... I realize that I was not given honest answers through the whole process. How are they allowed to tamper with a ""confirm reservation"" without notifing anyone especially when the bed type is changed without consent and the total cost changed so dramatically? How can a hotel with 1,152 rooms not know that they have ADA rooms with 2 double beds automatically? How come the hotel can't see the charges applied on a reservation like the $400 extra person charge that was added to my reservation? Unforuntately, I have already purchased 3 airline tickets so I'm not able to cancel the hotel reservation. And since I don't have enough points to switch to another Sherton property, I'm stuck with this reservation. If I had more points, I would completely cancel this reservation and move elsewhere and not deal with this type of dishonesty for profit.","Kirkland, Washington","Kauai2BE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kirkland, Washington</strong>",8,1.0

PRINCESS KAIULANI:She was appointed Crown Princess of the Kingdom of Hawaii, and was next in line to be queen had it not been for the overthrow of the monarchy. She died at the young age of 23. LOCATION:Talk about centralized. Being smack dab in the middle of Waikiki makes walking convenient and Ubering cheap. It's walking distance to Waikiki's highlights like the International Market Place, Royal Hawaiian Center, and the Waikiki Yokocho. ATMOSPHERE:It's an older property but well-maintained. Vehicular access can be annoying as you have to yield for droves of pedestrians due to the sidewalk that fronts the property. The tower we stayed in rose about 10 stories with another taller tower next door about double its height. The hotel's pool and open-air restaurant greets you with the registration desk off to the side. The small pool harmoniously blends with the hotel's outdoor restaurant along with the businesses and public sidewalk of Kalakaua Avenue giving you great people-watching views but not much ""pool privacy"". While it was busy, it never felt over-crowded. ROOM:Our room overlooked the pool along Kalakaua Ave. via a small balcony with chairs and a table. Bedding was comfortable though a little springy. While no built-in charging ports were available, a handy power strip was found under the bed. A/C was strong. The floors, ceilings and walls are thin, so we experienced a lot of noise from the room above us in the morning, possibly from a small child running around, or a noisy housekeeper banging things with the vacuum. BATHROOM:Shower-tub combo, single basin, good water pressure and drainage. RESORT CHARGE:At $33/day, the perks are multiple (see my pic) but appeals to a certain market. Parking is not included and rings in at an additional $35/day. That's why we Uber!SERVICE:Ziggy checked us in. He was friendly and professional. The male associate who checked us out was friendly but I didn't even receive a simple ""thank you"".A big mahalo to the security officer I spoke to after getting home as we left a CPAP breathing machine in the room. He was very helpful and gave clear instructions on what to do. LOST & FOUND:I've never heard of chargerback.com but that's who they use for lost and found items. Filled out a simple form online, paid for shipping, and received our item via USPS in under a week. FITNESS CENTER:While I didn't use it, I saw it from our balcony. It's on the second level and overlooks the restaurant and pool. TIP:They have a nostalgic mail letter drop, the type that starts at the top floor and goes all the way down to the basement, with access points on each level across from the elevators.

Nice bar too! I stayed here for a week in a nice, very comfortable renovated room that had a terrible view (parking lot) and bird poop all over the balcony, but that didn't matter to me as whenever I wanted to go outside I just... left my room. I didn't try the food here other than the food cart by the pool near the street which sells a great acai bowl and coffee. The common areas of the hotel could benefit from a bit of renovation, and I didn't quite like that the elevators weren't secure (anyone can go up to any floor without a key) but I was happy with my room. Other than the nice room and amazing pool, the real reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because I idiotically left a large amount of items in my closet when I checked out and the hotel not only tracked them down immediately (including an expensive designer blazer) was super duper nice about mailing them to me.

We were in the Kualani Tower Room 1189 on the 11th floor. This tower is so dated and in desperate need of refurbishing. It smells of stale cigarettes and is musty. at first glance our room itself was okay dated with maybe a bathroom renovation done in recent years but the step in bath/shower is awkward and the toilet space is tiny! The towel rail is above the toilet and is loose. There were also no shampoo or conditioner in the room - this was rectified when I asked for it the next day.The biggest problem we had was the air conditioning. The room was so hot and the air conditioning just did not work properly. We had the temp set to 18.5 C (65F) and it was still hot in the room and it was so noisy we couldn’t sleep. After the first night I called reception to ask if there was anything they could do. The lady who answered was very understanding and explained that their systems were down. She said they would get a repairman to come and look at the unit and would let me know the outcome and if there was anywhere else available in the hotel. I never heard another word from anyone. The air conditioner did seem a little quieter but still the room was too hot to sit in. The safe didn’t work properly it was flashing battery when I told reception they said we would have to be there for that to be looked at - we didn’t bother. We went to use the ironing board it collapsed every time you put any pressure on it.I’ve read reviews about mini bars there certainly was no mini bar in our room.One morning when we went out for the day there was a room service tray left out the front of someone’s room - it was still there when we returned at 10pm that night!We stay in Sheraton properties every year and to put this property as a category 5 astounds me. The location is great but there are plenty of other hotels with a great location!! I am sure the rooms overlooking the ocean are better but unfortunately I won’t be back to try them. We travelled with 2 other couples who stayed in 2 different hotels and I would stay at either of those before thinking about the Sheraton again. ,"Greenway, Australia","ColdinCbr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greenway, Australia</strong>",32,1.0

It's nice to feel like a tourist every once and again, so we took the time to drive in from nearby downtown Honolulu to the PK for an over-nighter. First of all, there are 3 other Starwood properties in Waikiki (including the Sheraton Waikiki, the Moana Surfrider and the Royal Hawaiian). Of all the properties in the Starwood family, the Princess Kaiulani is the most value-priced (even though we paid around $300 after the $35 resort fee, $35 parking fee and taxes). Yes, even though it is the most economically priced...it still puts a dent in one's pocket! Enjoy the splurge!!!The last time I stayed at this property was prior to the refurbishment. Happy to report the renovation/refresher packs a huge improvement! The fact that it is less ""lux"" than its sister properties, it more than makes up for in comfort and amenities. To name a few: every room has a balcony (a must in Hawaii so you can enjoy our trade-wind breezes while sipping on a glass of your favorite cocktail...or starting your morning with a cup of java); each room has a mini-frig (to stock up on your essentials like soda, cheeses and yogurt); a water dispenser in the lobby near the elevators (so that you can fill your own hydroflask for the day and do away with plastic bottled water -our ocean honu turtles thank you for that); towels and beach chairs are free for the asking (for when you venture a block down to the famous beaches that Waikiki is known for)!I requested an early check-in (Saturday at 10am) and a late check out (Sunday at 4pm) and both were granted. So thrilled they could do this for the kama'aina (locals)! Much mahalos!While here, we used the gym facility which was quite adequate and offered more machines than most other hotel gyms. But why not get a workout in the pool instead? So we headed to the pool... We enjoyed the pool very much. It is not overly crowded and we did not have any trouble finding chaise lounges for us. We also split a burger and a smoothie with very friendly pool-side service. Never had a roasted pineapple in my burger before, but it was divine! Tip: If you can find it in your budget, splurge on an ocean view. I live here, and it still leaves me breathless!

We also had an amazing view of the pool area and it was lovely listening to the island music from the band in the afternoon and evening. Yes the place is a little outdated but l think it’s still a beautiful place to stay. The bellboys were quick to take our luggage off us to take to our room! The staff were courteous and helpful. The foyer, bar and pool area were great to just sit and relax. We bought cocktails which l thought were quite reasonable. We never had any meals here as we found it more reasonable going to Royal Hawaiian Centre Food court. I think the pool should be opened longer at night as sometimes we would be out all day and still want to have a swim in the pool after 7pm but that’s when it closed so we would have to go over to the beach which lm not complaining about that as the sunsets were amazing on Waikiki beach. We stayed here as part as our Cosmos stop over so had no choice in this hotel but l noticed it’s quite expensive to stay at, so if l was going to come to Waikiki Beach again l think l would go to the hotel next door, the Ohana Waikiki East by Outrigger which looked really good and was quite reasonable for money and still close to everything.

The rooms aren't top-notch in decorating terms, but we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in December 2017 and paid through the nose for a room that was frankly no nicer, and the staff at the Hilton had no interest in their guests except to add extra items to their bills. The central location of the Princess meant we could pop back to the hotel in the afternoon for a swim and reasonably priced pool cocktails, then go out again for dinner and more shopping :) The only complaint is that the pool is really deep with a very small shallow end, so all the kids had to cram into a small patch.

I was supposed to arrive from Big Island and leave for Korea the next day. I spent a lot of money on hotel during in Hawaii(Trumph int'l Waikiki, Disney Aulani, Hilton, Maunakea beach resort), so last day was just a short time, so I chose the Sheraton Kaiulani for the cheap price. But it was a big mistake. With the credit card I used to check in, they were approved for my dinner at the hotel. and it did not cancel credit card approval (approximately $ 140) even though it paid cash for resort fees and dinners when checked out. The cancellation of the credit card authorization was not immediate, so I was waiting believing it would be canceled.However, the credit card payment was not cancelled and was withdrawn from my account. I've sent a lot of emails to Sheraton But their answer to come back -- I don't know because there's no evidence... I should have received a separate cash receipt. I just got a zero bill only. Of course I knew there would be no problem. Because I have been doing this -Use credit card when checking in and pay cash when checking out.- to other hotels. So where did my cash go ....??????? I felt sorry for choosing the Sheraton name. Dinner was good because it was cheap. It was relatively cheap considering the price of Hawaii. I wish I had not paid double the fee for double payment.Anyway, since there is no evidence at the hotel,---They say they have never received my cash. CCTV is at the wrong angle and they can't see me paying cash. Should I waste my golden time just now only for $ 140???I think I should make this issue known so that no one can be harmed.I hope no one else will have problems like me in the future. If you're just going to use a credit card, never give out cash.

We would go out on our balcony to see if it was crowded or not and if you looked left you could see partial view of the ocean, which was also nice. Moving back to poolside there is an opening that leads you to the main strip. In the evening you could see the vendors selling their flash wares. It was such an awesome view from our room - we just loved it. However the only down side which turned it from a 5* to a 4* was the size of the balcony. It was extremely small, barely enough room to fit a small table and two chairs.Take the room with the breakfast. For us it was so worth it. We really loved the breakfast: omelette station, hash browns, bacon, 2 different types of sausage, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, salad bar, fresh juice, coffee, pancakes and French toast alternated days, and they also had a Japanese breakfast too. The food (North American side) was very good!Down by the pool deck, the guys give out beach chairs and beach towels to take to the beach. Mr. Freezies, oranges and apples are offered poolside next to where you pick up the towels and beach chairs. They also go on the beach and offer their guests fresh fruit and water a couple of times a day. Make sure you take the hotel towel or they will not know you're a guest. Also watch out for them in case they miss you.Across the street at Kings Village, there are vedors that set up there in the evening. Go to the very top, you can get pad thai, fried rice, chicken, shrimp, beef, etc on skewers. I took pad thai and chicken on skewers for $10. and it was a lot of food and also very good! Down at the bottom they had fresh salads, fruit and pastries for dessert. These were being sold anywhere from $2. - $5.00. It's definitely worth it and fun to buy from the locals.

The hotel room 622 in the Princess Kaiulani tower was so old the furniture seen better days , bathroom so small with no extraction fans so was rather smelly. View from dirty balcony was not too bad. After first night requested a change in room due to state of bathroom and after 3 days were told they upgraded us to a more expensive room on the tenth floor. Well the bathroom was the same size but with extraction fan so minus the smell. Room furniture was slightly better, comfort of bed and pillows was much better and room appeared more airy, but been an upgrade from 6 to 10 you not paying for a better room but a better view. The pool is not very practical as there is not much room just to stand around in the pool as it gets very deep very quickly. You cannot stand around the sides of the pool either as it so deep. Pool rather small for the size of the hotel. All the social media photos make it look amazing but it is not. Resort fees are a rort, activities offered to guest should be complimentary and getting MiFi and 1 day GoPro , which if you are not aware of, is not highlighted or advised at time of booking would be cheaper to buy yourself.

Having stayed here now literally an uncountable # of nights, I still find myself pleasantly surprised with something new the hotel has to offer with each new stay. The location is quite frankly unbeatable. Steps away from Waikiki beach and right in the heart of all the action. It has solidified itself as a timeless classic among the hotels that flood the streets of Waikiki by maintaining it's old-school charm and allure. And while I can go on and on about the vast oceanic views, the live-music performances, or the insanely appetizing buffets, I'd be remiss is I left out the one piece of this puzzle that makes this hotel such an integral part of my Hawaii experience: the staff. Throughout all of my check-ins, my lost key replacements, or any one of my annoying requests for information, I'd be greeted with a warm welcome and a smile. I can't say enough good things about the people that help make this place run as smoothly as it does, especially Sabrina at the front desk in particular. She has become my go-to fixer for everything.

Ladies, take your own hairdryer with you, don’t rely on the one provided. It was also quite old. The hotel amenities are also quite dated. Pictures you see online are very deceiving.

At check-in, we were upgraded from a partial ocean view room to a full ocean view room for our 5-night stay. The views of the mountains and beach were fantastic, and the patio has plenty of space to hang out and take it all in. Shortly upon settling into our room, housekeeping delivered a complimentary bottle of wine with a note from the guest relations manger for the occasion we were celebrating. This totally took us by surprise, and was an incredibly kind gesture. As SPG Gold, we received two free breakfast vouchers for our stay. There was a mix-up with the date on which they expired and after talking to the front desk, the manager on duty told the person at the desk to give us two more vouchers for the ""hassle."" The hotel definitely could have cured the immediate issue without doing more, and we would have been happy campers. The general management delivers service that is above and beyond!We also received impeccable service from other employees at the hotel. I'd like to recognize Kim, our breakfast waitress, and Eric, one of the bartenders, for being exceptionally kind and attentive. Housekeeping serviced our room promptly every day, and refilled water and toiletries as needed. One of the employees who works at the pool deck even recognized us from our January visit and made a point of welcoming us back.

Staff were mainly friendly. We were in an updated room which was very nicely decorated and booked a partial ocean view. We were on the North side of the tower so could see ocean and mountains. The downside is that you are also overlooking the international marketplace and the (I assume) air conditioners on top are on constantly and are very noisy, the first few nights we had trouble sleeping. The last time we stayed we were overlooking the pool which I think is a better option.I also don’t think the resort fee is good value. Image attached. Last time we stayed we at least got a couple of free drinks at the bar as well as the wifi and phone calls. The Go Pro rental we thought would be great for our helicopter tour, but then we were told we had to purchase the SSD card ourselves (for $US30) and for something we don’t have use for it was a waste of money - Why offer this as an inclusion in the resort fee and then charge for the card which you need to use it? They could easily include this and wipe for the next user.Everything else on the list wasn’t worth anything to us.We had the buffet breakfast included which was convenient and generally pretty good. I like that they employ older workers there.We used the pool a couple of times, generally could always get a sunlounge and while the pool isn’t huge, it’s perfectly fine and flows nicely from the bar and breakfast area.The only thing I really wasn’t happy with was one of the bellhops ‘suggesting’ to a taxi driver that he point out to us a hotel on the way to diamond head that he said Mark Twain had stayed in. We’ve been there before and we know the way to diamond head so lucky for the taxi driver he did not take us the long way around. It did not sit well with me and we did not appreciate this tactic.

We had opted for a city view as it was cheaper but when we checked in our ""view"" was of a brick wall! Seriously six feet or so outside our window (room 327) was another building! NOT ACCEPTABLE. I requested a room change and they were gracious enough to allow this This was by the elevators but a far superior view. The rooms in the photos are NOT the only rooms in the hotel, these rooms are pool view/sea view and the ones on the other side of the hotel have NO BALCONY and are considerably smaller - bear this in mind when you book. There is sufficient space if all you intend to do in the room is sleep. Upon arrival we had a hamper of fruit, juice and dry food snacks, which was most welcome (we were told this was because we were long stay guests - 7 nights). The pool is smaller than I had expected but as we went in March there were always loungers and it was big enough for our needs but I imagine in the better weather it would get crowded. Free towels are available with your room key and I saw many guests take these over to the beach (less than two minutes away). The splash bar has happy hour between 11am and 6pm and the drinks choice is good, many rum based cocktails if you are into that sort of flavour. The food is a bit overpriced and there are better options outside of the hotel, that being said the seaweed popcorn was nice (special mention to Letitia!!). The staff were lovely, all of them and so friendly and helpful. The show is held three nights a week and is well worth seeing - pick up a voucher book from the lobby and you can get 50% of a second cocktail and show ticket so $90 for a cocktail and the show for two people or the premium dinner inclusive package for $120 each or there about. Its definitely worth seeing it was one of my favourite parts of my vacation. The AT&T free myfi option was also very welcome and saved me lots of money in data and roaming fees. It is the little touches like this that made the hotel a great one. . I don't know if its a US thing but the hotel don't provide shower gel like a UK hotel would. They do provide shampoo, conditioner, body lotion and soap so I'm glad I packed my own! They provide flannel, hand towel and bath towel, although the latter is quite small. The room did come with a fridge so pick up a few drinks and they'll stay nice and chilled in your room while you are out. They gave us two bottles of water every day (included in the resort fee). our room had a detachable clothes line over the bath for drying swimwear etc and a full laundrette in the basement $5 for wash and $5 for a dry. Its worth doing if you would rather pack less clothes - it was a popular feature of the hotel.

The good things first:- The bed was fantastic and gave me really good sleeps. - My room was always clean and well prepared by the maid. - Most staff I interacted with were friendly and nice. The tour desk staff is very knowledgeable and provided me with good advice. - The location is very good. Everything in Waikiki is within easy walking distance. Now the downs:- The interior of the room is old and cheap with furniture looking like 1980s plastic. The cups for coffee and water were paper and plastic, which reminded me rather of a youth hostel. To sum up, the room didn’t feel like Sheraton. It clearly needs an upgrade. - Windows aren’t sound-proof. One could well hear the noise from the street and from the pool area (live music in the evenings).- I had to complain twice before the drain in the bathtub was de-clogged. Before, I had to cut my shower in fear that I might flood the whole room. - The breakfast buffet is just ok. Not really many choices. But at least the hotel caters for the Japanese guests. - I’m particularly annoyed about the “resort charge” of roughly $35 per day (see picture for details). In my mind, it’s a barefaced rip off with a number of “benefits” that nobody needs: free breakfast for a child if you don’t travel with one? Let alone if breakfast is included in the rate? A promotion booklet by local retailers and restaurants? I would expect that the things one really needs, like free WiFi, was part of the service without the need of being mentioned, as it is international (=non U.S. perhaps) standard. Because of the “resort charge”, I follow the contributor who wrote about this hotel on 26 March 2018 and deduct one point from my rating.Given the price I paid per night, I conclude that value-for-money is not very good. The hotel doesn’t fulfil what one would expect under the Sheraton brand. Thus and despite the good things mentioned, I can not recommend this hotel.

Not sure where to start but let’s start with the water “spray” that soaked our carpet in our room for two days in our entry way and closet area. The water you know has done that before and the room definitely has a “funky” smell to it. I feel sorry for the maintenance guy who had to fix it and look us in the eye knowing it wasn’t the first time by his explanation of “must be a clogged pipe......again!!!” The pool area is small and definitely doesn’t accommodate all of the hotel guests. We got to the pool early on Monday and got some good seats while waiting for our kids. As the sun shifted, we moved our chairs to capture some sun after two rainy days. We were not blocking access to the pool, walkways or anything, just giving our kids some sunshine to lay out in. The pool “staff” quickly came over and said we couldn’t even move our chairs or, let the umbrella (which by the way was shading ONLY our chairs) down. We asked him how can we get sun and his response showed a complete and utter lack of customer service when he said “go to the beach, there is sun their”. A beach with 3,000 people and waves that will knock you over. There are reasons people lay by the pool versus going to the beach....completely oblivious and quite frankly and obnoxious answer. The check in was with an individual who wasn’t interested in being someone who would make the stay pleasant, but rather someone who seemed bothered by the fact that he had to do his job. Between not being able to move chairs and dodging the little red fire ants along the pool sitting area the day was uneventful...One bright spot was a young man who was working at the desk the next day, who worked with us and provided some info and some good answers to questions. Understanding this was spring break, there seemed to be very few people from the US here, and it was mainly some wonderful people from South Korea and a Japan, many who I had some fantastic conversations with. Great people who tell me they love coming to Honolulu for a vacation and getting away from the hustle and bustle of their lives..Not sure how our check out will be but I am going to assume interesting to say the least. No call from the front desk with an apology but hoping for the best.Do not recommend this hotel if you are looking for relaxing or quiet...noisy main road, terrible views, loud people, parking garage with no space (and a $35.00 per day parking fee added to your bill)....","Happy Valley, Oregon","Kevin W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Happy Valley, Oregon</strong>",4,2.0

It was my 4th stay. The hotel is very central - handy to everything. The International Market Place is next door, Kings Village is opposite with a few take-aways attached (KFC, Subway etc) and also a large ABC store next to that. It's a short walk to the beach and handy to bus stops. The hotel itself has a good atmosphere. The Splash Bar by the pool is great with good happy hour prices. We stayed in the older tower which we found still good. Large room with refrigerator. I think though when booking a room you need to get at least a pool view room as some of the rooms would just overlook the car park which wouldn't be as nice.

The lobby and pool bar etc are unchanged and welcoming, and the staff friendly, but the rest of the hotel is pretty tired, and service is lacking. Our room in the tower over looked the beach and the small balcony is fantastic, but the rooms are tiny - and I mean tiny. The outdoor furniture on the balcony was old and stained, the bathroom barely big enough to swing a cat, and three nights there was no hot water! The beds are comfortable but there isn't enough room for more than one tired old cane chair (the same one as our first visit 12 years ago!) in the corner of the room so one of us was forced to sit on the bed to watch TV in the evening. Add to this the fact our room didn't get made up on three occasions and when it did they still missed things like replacing the coffee, or the cups, or the creamer (It was hit and miss and never once done right) and the fact that they now slug you $35 per day for parking (that used to be included the 33 dollar a day resort fee) and the place isn't the value it once was. On previous visits we had things like complimentary drinks on arrival and a free photo by the fish pond. This visit we were supposed to get access to a GoPro camera and a portable wifi device but no-one seemed to know anything about it at check in and the ""service desk"" staff didn't either so we gave up on it.

But it is not just the location - the open air lobby opens up to the small pool (with great pool chairs), pool bar and the buffet; area artisans set up shop near the lobby. Rooms from the tower showcase beautiful views of the bay and the mountainside.Rooms are well kept and clean. The bed is comfy. Air-conditioning worked just fine. The balconies make the room! The only problem we had was the shower... the water flow was practically non existent. It took me a long time to wash my long hair. The bathroom is in desperate need of updating. And they need better towels.Front Desk staff provided a quick check in and out experience. They offered insights to area sights and greetings everyday. The breakfast buffet was delicious. They presented so many options... an omlette station, pasteries, fruits, salads, country cooking, and Japanese fare. You can’t leave here hungry. In fact, if you are waking up at the crack of dawn, this buffet will keep you growling stomach in check until lunch time easily. Everyone working at the buffet was friendly and we never had an issue being seated instantly. Easily a highlight.We were happy with everything (minus the shower), unless you consider the parking. Parking was another matter entirely. It is pricey - $35/day! That was obscene and the people that run the garage could be impatient and inflexible... do NOT forget your pink ticket or they will make you think the world is ending. The garage is not well marked. Our first trip into the winding monster meant we parked floors away from the hotel access point because there is virtually no signage. Turns are tight. Not everyone that parks there parks smartly meaning that tight spaces are even tighter. Since we sandwiched out Hawaii trip with Oahu, we only rented a car for 1 of our 2 stays this trip. You honestly don’t need a car in Waikiki... rent your car when you need it only. Save yourself this tacked on expense that is not included in the resort fee!

Parking was $35/day which my work thankfully paid for. Parking structure often appeared full, but i was always able to find roof deck spots available. The $16 per person shuttle to and from the airport is actually not a bad deal, since we paid $38 for a taxi for 2 ppl, before tip. At times there were long waits for the elevators, while they were very fast, inexplicably a few would go out of service during peak hours. As SPG gold members, we got a priority line for check-in/check-out, we received breakfast buffet tickets for not 1 but 2 breakfasts ($30 value each) on two separate occasions. I got a room on the 21st floor, some things in the room seemed much more recently updated than the bathroom tiles which seemed very old. Bedding was comfortable. Lanai was a nice feature, but i got freaked out looking down. The city noise/construction site next door is quite loud at night. Fitness center was located in a ballroom with chandelier lighting, but i loved that it was very spacious for free weights, HITT, floor exercise purposes. View of the pool is included. Splash bar will give you free nori flavored popcorn with drink order. Splash bar service was very good at noon on a Monday, but otherwise i did not get to enjoy. Free live music or hula dancing most nights around the pool area. We barely took advantage of any of the resort fee ($30/night) inclusions.Staying this far into the heart of Waikiki, I will say it took 20-25 minutes every morning, leaving at 7am to get on the H1. It took 10-15 mintues to get on the H1 when i left at 6am. Also returning in the evening, the total commute took 1 hour, when theoretically the drive should have been 35 mintues (from East Side/Kailua).

Check-in was busy, but the SPG line moved quickly. Even though we arrived around noon, the room was ready. Room: The room was as expected - clean but dated (there's a reason this place is way cheaper than the other SPG hotels nearby). However, the large balcony and breathtaking view more than made up for an older room. The room has a fridge for personal use, a coffeemaker with tea and coffee, and one of the best hotel hairdryers I've come across. Housekeeping was great.

Surprisingly, this location was really quiet. We never heard the elevator or staff. And when we did see staff in the hallways, they always gave us a big smile and answered any questions we had.Bar: The bartenders were incredibly nice and accommodating, and the drinks are reasonably priced for a Waikiki resort. The bar offers complimentary popcorn with seaweed/furikake that is delicious.Pool/Beach: The pool felt cold to us, so we didn't go in. We either went in the ocean or sat by the pool. That being said, many kids and adults were in the pool everyday. There was plenty of seating, too. The drink/food service at the pool was fast! We rented towels and complimentary beach chairs to take to the beach every day. The chairs were a big plus.

We normally get late check-out as SPG Gold members, but we booked a hotel and flight package through Hawaiian this time. No problem! We checked out at 2 pm, hit the beach and happy hour, and came back to shower. The hotel offers a room for an hour so you can freshen up before your flight.

The property was pretty average across the board.A couple of specifics that did stand out: (1) The gentleman that checked us in was competent but couldn't have been more disinterested in his job. (2) Our room was recently updated, but with somewhat tone deaf design choices. For example, there was very limited counter space in the room so you really had to pick and choose what you could bring out of your bag and the narrow ledge above the toilet was positioned such that the toilet seat couldn't stay up without being held in position.Overall, since we only showed up, slept, and left in exchange for saving a few dollars, I am not sure I would retrospectively change my plan. If this is a real vacation day for you, however, I would recommend staying at one of the much nicer properties within blocks of this one.

After 12 days it felt like the walls were closing in. Would definitely look to get a larger room next time. The room itself was ok, bathroom seemed dated but otherwise comfortable sleep. To be honest when you are in Honolulu you aren't spending time in your hotel room...Had breakfast at the buffet once and while the food was ok, it was very expensive and as we are not big eaters was not worth the money. Sometimes the smell of breakfast/dinner goes through the elevators, should have some air freshness in the elevator as the smell can be off putting sometimes.Splash bar is great to enjoy a few drinks by the pool or after a day out, staff are friendly and service is pretty good. If you don't want a fancy cocktail they will make normal cocktails if you ask. Had snacks a few times and they are pretty good also.Location is ideal. 5 minutes to the beach, restaurants, cafes and shops and ABC right across the road and another 5 within 5 minutes if that one doesn't have anything you need.Overall had no real complaints, just wish I booked a larger room.",,cameronmP8329CN,7,3.0

Good nightly music, however the music at 6.00am every morning through the speakers was fairly loud. Would not hesitate to stay here again.","Mount Maunganui, New Zealand","Judith777</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mount Maunganui, New Zealand</strong>",45,4.0

Our room was a decent size for a short stay, we had a poolview room and from the balcony also had a glimpse of the ocean. The hotel is in a great location, easy walking distance to the beach, restaurants, shopping, bus and tram stops are also close by. Although we did not eat at the restaurant we did enjoy a few light meals at the Splash Bar. Service in this area was efficient and the wait staff were particularly friendly and polite. We tried a few menu items and sampled the daily cocktails, our favourite meals were the Coconut Shrimp and Buffalo Wings. The NOT SO GOOD – we went to bed early on the first night after a long flight from Australia and were woken a few hours later by an emergency evacuation alarm (twice), which turned out to be a false alarm, thankfully. The pool is not huge and there was a shortage of sun lounges at times. There is a guest laundry available but it does cost to use the washers and dryers. The hotel is quite dated and could definitely use a bit of a revamp but our room was clean so we were satisfied. As others have stated the elevators can be slow but we found it to only be a minor inconvenience at peak times.The DEAL BREAKER – we did not unpack our bags as we were only staying a short time before heading off on a cruise but while we were in Waikiki I purchased 2 new dresses to wear on the ship. One was just a beach/pool cover up but the other was a nice evening dress which I intended to wear to our anniversary dinner. I hung both dresses in the wardrobe to prevent them being creased and unfortunately I forgot to pack them when we left. Once onboard the ship I realised that I had left them behind but did not have any phone service at that time to be able to contact the hotel. I called Guest Services when I was able and advised the staff member what had happened, assuming that housekeeping would have noticed the garments when they were cleaning the room and put them aside. Guest Services tried to direct my call to the relevant area but they were not answering and eventually she took my name and number and said they would investigate and call me back. Nobody returned my call that day or the next so I called again and was told that I needed to complete an online form for lost items. I explained that I had already called and left my details and was still waiting on someone calling me back and I was not able to complete the online form.When we returned to Waikiki I followed up with the hotel again and advised that I would be making my way down to collect the dresses. This time someone from hotel security called me back and stated that nothing had been ‘handed in’ from our room but he would double check with housekeeping and get back to me – I’m still waiting. I accept responsibility for the loss as it was my error in leaving the dresses behind but can’t help feeling disappointed that I had to call three times before the hotel investigated (or not) and although the garments were not hugely expensive one in particular certainly had sentimental value to me.Would we stay here again? NO - holiday makers are spoilt for choice around this area and if we return to Honolulu I would not choose to stay here again.","Bundaberg, Australia","KarenLQldAust_</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bundaberg, Australia</strong>",46,3.0

No new shampoo bottles after we used the original bottle from checkin.Termites - in our door which leave us little piles of gnawed wood every day. See pictures! But, better termites than the other, unmentionable bugs! :) We have reported these critters each day to the hotel. But we still have our new ""pets.""While the staff is friendly, upon checkin, there's very little instruction on how the resort works - other than you'll be paying a big resort fee. Are there activities? Where do you get the ""refreshments"" by the beach?

All staff that we dealt with were very helpful and super polite.Splash bar - we spent a lot of time here and I had read some great reviews, they werent wrong, but one thing I would suggest is some background music, there could be better atmosphere there and Im not talking about the live music each night, have some music all the time there, the pool area and outdoor dining area is big enough that if people prefer quiet there is space for that.Tours were organised well altho we were overcharged for the outlet tour, were charged an extra $7 each, doesnt sound much but all adds up, however when we realised and bought it to the attention of the tour desk they apologised and refunded us.Overall a good place to stay, would we stay there again, yes!","Auckland, New Zealand","Jojopopo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",2,4.0

We chose this hotel for location and price. Neither of us are big city/big hotel people but we had a good experience at this hotel despite it being both! Parking is around the corner from the hotel and costs 35 dollars per night. The hotel allows you to park until midnight of the day of your checkout, so if you are planning to walk around Waikiki just leave the car in the garage. Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a room with an amazing view on one of the top floors of the tower. Simply gorgeous. The room was basic but was very clean and did the job. Elevators, as others have mentioned, were not as frequent as they could have been but this is not the fault of the hotel - its an older building and only so many elevators were built.I must give a shout out to one amazing employee - Ziggy on the front desk. He took the time on our check in to answer questions about the island and even made recommendations on where to drive and what to do all with a smile. This young man is a shining example of what a welcome to a hotel should consist of. Thanks, Ziggy - you made our visit.The resort fee of 28 gives you beach towels, beach chairs, and internet access among other things. If you are only staying for one night, really it's just you paying for internet but I imagine if staying and going to the beach, having the chairs/towels/etc provided would be amazing and well worth it.The reason for the 4 instead of 5 rating is that on the morning of our checkout we went out to eat and returned to our room at 10 am (checkout is 11). After waiting for elevators for quite a while, we arrive at our room to find out that keys don't work. Housekeeping was there but would not let us in, nor would they radio down to the front desk. We had to wait again for elevators and go back down. We were then told that the timers on the door locks were not in sync with the real time so we were locked out because the doors thought it was after checkout time. We were also told it was a known problem and they had been trying to solve it for some time. Here's a simple solution. Program the keys with a later checkout to reflect the time the doors think it is. That way, guests will not leave with the last memory of an otherwise great stay as one of extreme annoyance. I truly hope the hotel has now solved this issue.We did not eat at the buffet (as we don't enjoy that style of eating) but did eat twice at the pool bar and it was great!!Overall, I would stay here again. Thanks again to Ziggy for making our stay memorable.","Barrie, Canada","Elizabeth A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barrie, Canada</strong>",119,4.0

There are two Sheraton’s in Waikiki so don't be confused as we originally were. This review is not about the Sheraton Waikiki which is much larger and more expensive. The PK lacks some amenities of the higher priced hotels but offers a pleasant stay at a reasonable price. While walking around we saw some other hotels in the area that we knew were even cheaper but when we visited them we knew that we definitely would not want to stay there.Here are some notes about the Princess Kaiulani.The entire staff was very helpful and friendly offering more service than I expected and made our stay very comfortable.The pool is small and the shallow area for the kids is even smaller. If you have a big family they will probably be bumping into each other.The pool side restaurant bar offered very tasty treats at a decent price for a mid-afternoon drink and snack.Breakfast at the hotel was limited. The main restaurant only served full breakfast buffet which cost about $26. They did not offer an a la carte menu for a simple coffee and a sweet roll or fruit which we would have liked.Although it's not right on the beach it's only a very short walk. You can check out a beach chair and towel in the pool area and take it to the beach. The public restrooms for the beach, snack bar and surfboard rentals are very close. The PK beach crew patrols the area regularly and will offer you cold bottled water and fresh fruit. Not as good as a cold beer or Maitai but it's a nice touch :-)We had a room on the 12th floor with a partial Ocean View. Our room was facing East toward Diamond Head, not directly South toward the water, but we still had a decent view of some of the beach (picture attached). When checking in, make sure you get something on the 12th floor or above or the building across the street will block all of your view.The room was not large but adequate for a week for two people. The bed and bedding were very comfortable. There was a refrigerator and single cup coffee pot in the room but no microwave. The bathroom vanity top was a little on the small side.This is a smaller hotel so there aren't any shops or chain restaurants on the premises. You will have to go outside for those.There are four elevators serving the tower and they were uncomfortably warm and always crowded. I have no suggestions for that. We just had to wait and squeeze in.If you rent a car you will need to pay $34 a day for parking at the hotel. I wouldn't think about trying to park on the street because it's very crowded in that area. Drive your car all the way up to the top level P5 to park it because that's where the elevator stops and it will be easy to get into the hotel from there.We enjoyed our stay at the Princess Kaiulani and found it very comfortable to come back to after a day of wandering through the bustle of Waikiki.

I'll start with the Cons. We booked three rooms for six guests 9 months in advance and paid for them upon booking. I reserved three KING Ocean View Rooms, and we were given three rooms with two queens/doubles (small beds) with ocean view. Upon check-in, I notified the gentleman that we wanted kings, and I even called to ensure we were getting kings. His reply was that I also requested high floors, and they just couldn't accommodate all of my wishes. Had I been given a free upgrade, I would not complain, but I paid for these rooms. Upon entering the rooms, I was saddened to see the same decor that we saw in 2010 when we stayed there. The carpets were tired as was the furniture. I know the hotel is undergoing room renovations, but when I paid for the upgraded room, I guess I assumed I'd get at least a king bed I wanted, but not two negatives so quickly. The room was clean except for the edges of the carpets, on light stain on the comforter, and the dust on the vent. I'll post pictures of that. The bathroom and furniture were all dust-free and well mopped. The positives far outweigh the negatives. The location is unbeatable, unless you're oceanfront, but this hotel is directly in front of the Moana and offers beautiful views. We like to stay at the Moana, but since we brought our parents on this trip, we opted to book the three rooms here and spend the difference on activities. This was a more cost-efficient option without sacrificing location. The hotel lobby is fun, and our parents all really enjoyed the energy with all the people and entertainment. There are plenty of sitting areas where you can relax and enjoy each other’s company in the lobby area. Another positive is the nightly entertainment. You can sit poolside and in the bar and enjoy live cultural performances as well as casual singing. We definitely enjoyed it. The bar drinks were yummy, and service was great! The buffet in the hotel seemed a little pricey for me, because I can't eat crab legs, but for the rest of our group, it was a bargain! :) The food was all fresh, and our dinner buffet included a variety of seafood and local options. Please note that sodas are not included in the buffet price.The pool is one of our favorite thing about this hotel. Compared to hotels in other cities, the pool might seem small, but it's actually larger than it looks in the pictures and large in comparison to other Waikiki hotels. It is a salt water pool (wonderful on the skin) and has a deep end. There are always lounge chairs available, as well, so there is no rush in reserving any. Our housekeepers were so nice and helpful. There is a desk in the hotel where you can book excursions if you'd like.Our parking fee was $35/day, but our resort fee was less than what we usually pay at hotels like Moana, so it was okay. There was also available parking each day for us. We had a large GMC Yukon XL, which is not the easiest to park in cramped quarters, but we managed to find parking every day. The hotel lends chairs and beach towels, which was awesome for beach time. :) There are also stores all around the hotel where you can buy anything you need like sunblock, umbrellas, etc. There is also a show in the hotel now. There is a gym, which we didn't use on this vacation, but it's nice to know it was there.On some days, there are craft vendors in the breezeway, and they have such beautiful handmade crafts. There were also places where the kids could learn how to make leis.I am not going to say I won't be back, because this hotel has far too many pros to push it aside. I will, however, request that my booking be matched as made without any petty excuses as to why I'm less important than any other guest. When I pay for a King upgrade with an ocean view, that's what I get anywhere else we go. Also, the carpet edges should be vacuumed, and the vents should be dusted/vacuumed, as well. My suggestion would be to definitely stay at the Princess K if you are going to Waikiki and it fits in your budget. Just ask for an renovated room. Other than that, I'm sure you will be pleased with the hotel. The location cannot be praised enough, and aside from my small gripes, I was quite pleased with our stay. With a renovated king room, I would have given this 5 stars.",Vegas,"KT702</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vegas</strong>",55,3.0

I was booked into a recently renovated room and really had a great view, but the room still felt dated and old. The same could be said of the elevator and also the hallways. It really feel like you are walking into a time machine of Waikiki in the 1960's.The staff on the other hand were all great and very accommodating. They really seemed to care for the guest and were efficient with check in. Every interaction I had from the front desk staff to housekeeping to the restaurant were all great. Even with the tired looking facility, the staff was pretty amazing.While this is branded a Sheraton, it really feels more like a Four Points. I think having the Sheraton name allows for higher prices to be charged, but if you go in with the thought it is going to be more like a Four Points, you will be fine. As an SPG Platinum, normally I would have access to the Club Lounge. This location did not seem to have a club lounge but they did offer a coupon for both a small plate item in the evening and the breakfast buffet in the morning. Both coupons said that gratuity was included so that was nice also for it to be truly free. Overall, I felt treated very well in a facility that has seen better days. If looking for the true Sheraton experience, then go for the other one in Waikiki. If you have the right expectations going in, then you will have a good experience here.","Chicago, Illinois","R W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",78,3.0

This time I decided to stay in the lower Princess block with a pool view room, I was on the 6th floor, once again I have nothing but praise for this hotel from the cleaning staff up, everyone always friendly. I surprised myself with how much I also enjoyed being at a lower level rather than way up high in the tower, I will say the lanai (balcony) is a bit tighter than the tower but nothing to worry about, you can still sit there and have your balcony doors wide open… a few of my favourite staff (Kathy on the desk, Heidi, Angie and Lei at the pool bar)were actually off on leave this time, however I did get to meet the most beautiful and helpful Gabriella from behind the scenes in HR while she was selling shirts to raise money for the children’s hospital, what a credit she is to this hotel! (hope she still has the kangaroo on her desk) .. also Linda on the desk to help you with go pro’s, portable wifi’s, sim cards etc was so friendly and helpful, as I’ve stated before, I don’t bother comparing other hotels for prices etc anymore, I just book here, so simple. My stay here on my return from the Caribbean was all I’d been looking forward to and hoping for after I had survived being trapped on the island of St Maarten when hurricane Irma hit, I was trapped there for 5 days without power or running water then evacuated to the Dominican Republic for 5 days til I could get back to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to make my connection back to Honolulu via Las Vegas. I had been travelling for 21hrs including layovers, I was totally exhausted and quite sick when I arrived at SPK a little too early for my room to be ready, thank god Kathy was on the desk when I arrived, she organized a temporary room for me, so I could clean up and refresh and sleep til my room was ready, this time on the 5th floor.. I was sooo thankful for that, she went to the trouble of organizing a basket of goodies with a card attached to be sent to my room for me as well. This time I was on the 5th floor Princess Pool View room, which I enjoyed, it was clean and comfortable as is always the case, and it’s nice to have the afternoon/evening music drifting up. As the days passed, Kalei at the pool, after hearing my story also surprised me and had a nice little basket sent to my room .. (I wasn’t telling my story for baskets) what a great guy he is, I also want to mention Gregg and Erin at the front desk, always friendly and helpful, and beautiful little Leonora the cleaner on the 5th floor, always looking out for me and ready to chat. I Got to catch up with Heidi and Angie at the Splash bar who both gave me a great big hug too lol .. Another PC has been added to the business center which is a lot better than lining up for just the single one which was there. I wonder if Gabriella had something to do with that?? .. No wonder I love staying here! … I’ll be back in April/May.","Gold Coast, Australia","rollingstone_au</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast, Australia</strong>",32,5.0

We had 4 rooms for our party and stayed here for 10 days with an average cost of $220. We moved rooms 4 times due to poor room conditions. There are several rooms where the AC does not work. The rooms had a minimum temperature of 78 degrees. One room had mold in it and another room had ants. We finally were moved to a newer remodeled room that the temperature would get down to 72 degrees. I could not believe that the rooms we were placed in were allowed to be utilized.When I asked about compensation for our troubles, we were given 2 adult tickets to buffet only. This was extremely disappointing because the buffet was limited in their food selection especially for those with food allergies. In addition, we would have had to pay for our kids to eat (which kids free was supposed to be included). As far as kids eat free, we were still charged at the splash bar restaurant for our kids' meals. The hotel stated that the splash bar was not considered a restaurant. It had a full menu and over 20 tables to sit at. Definitely would consider that a restaurant.Pool is not kid friendly. The staff restrict any toys and the less that 6 foot deep end is about 1/4 of pool. The majority of splash bar wait staff, with exception to Romeo only serve you when you flag them down. Positives are they offer seats for the beach and free icee poles for everyone. Definitely utilize somewhere else than the hotel's excursion desk. They are over priced and do not provide all details. For example, we reserved for Pearl Harbor. The tour was rushed and did not allow for time to do audio tour plus Arizona memorial. The hotel staff did not tell us that we would have to check bags at gate for a $4 charge per bag. Our tour guide provided misleading information regarding how much effort she had to put into obtaining our tickets. She often had a passive aggressive attitude and was extremely strict. 2nd example was we reserved the luau at the hotel. They told us to be a half 1/2 hour early. They failed to tell us there were kids activities before the event and our kids missed it. We then had very disappointed kids once they could not participate in the activities.I received a survey from the hotel and provided the above information with the disappointment. They provided a template response stating they would discuss with the hotel. I never received any follow up.

Upon arrival we were checked in and given our room key. As soon as we entered the room we were so underwhelmed and disappointed. This was the first night of our honeymoon and we were expecting so much more. We had booked a room with a partial Ocean View. The furnishings in the room were extremely dated and the space was very small. The bathroom was basic, certainly not luxurious as had been sold to us by Kuoni our travel agent. When we opened the balcony door to have a look out to the ocean, I didn't know which way to look it was non existent. To top it off there was a bug on the bed so the room didn't even look clean. We called down to reception and told them about the view and that we weren't happy with the room. They moved us to a full ocean View. I would argue that this was actually partial but at this point it was probably as good as we were going to get. There was no acknowledgement of our honeymoon by the hotel in way of even a congratulations, it was a very disappointing start to the holiday. We didn't spend much time in the hotel as we booked lots of tours during our short stay in Oahu.

Another time there were lots of black bugs, horrible AC and the AC was very loud. Two of those examples were very outdated rooms.-The breakfast is literally almost the exact same thing every day. The omelet makers are ornery and prefer to make omelets the easiest way for them which means a ridiculous amount of oil that you will be consuming so the omelet flips easily for them...there is a salad of quinoa or pasta or rice however it is usually drenched in oil, drenched! The dressing renders the salads useless to me. They seem to cater to one specific demographic.-The electronic equipment in the gym does not work well at all...I spend far too much time trying to get the control panels to work, I end up annoyed and wasting time.- The pool is too small for the property size.-The beds and bedding are not the standard Sheraton quality of the past. They are not comfortable.-The lobby needs more than one computer, it is difficult to find it free to be able to print your boarding passes etc.-There is an on site laundry if you would like to do your own laundry however the machines are front loaders and the plastic rims are always disgusting...I can not believe it is sanitary to do your laundry in those machines.","Nashville, Tennessee","Ann C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",1128,3.0

We particularly love the paintings by Heather who paints and sells her paintings in the hotel foyer 3 days a week. We have been staying at this hotel during our Hawaii holidays for the past 4 years. My criticisms are the beds are double size and would like to have had queens size beds which we have at home, and the rediculous compulsory resort fee (which is a common hotel fee in most Hawaiian hotels) and it's inclusions which hits the hip pocket. Last year the resort fee included free parking where it does not include any more, so now to pay $70USD for parking and the resort fee each day on top of your accommodation fees is very expensive. There is a nearby parking station at $20 per day which is half the price for parking at the Sheraton Princess, so we ended up parking at the $20 parking station.We love Hawaii and enjoy our stay at the Sheraton Princess each time.

The AC, TV, wireless internet and shower all worked well and was sufficient for a business traveler who does not spend time in the room. The hotel lobby is a mix of modern and very dated design - not sure why the whole thing hasn't been renovated. The pool area is decent and gets plenty of sun even until 5pm. Parking is steep at $35 a day. What are the positives? First of all, I would have normally given this a 3 rating, but the staff were above and beyond professional, very friendly, and helped me recover a passport I left in my room safe. If you are looking for a centrally located hotel in Waikiki, close to restaurants, shops, and beach, at a decent price for the area, this is it. The fact that you could walk out the door and safely walk in any direction with so much to see along Waikiki's main strip is probably the biggest seller. Of course, this is not your parents' Waikiki and there are way better areas to stay than Honolulu if this is your first time to Hawaii. Negatives?

The room size was good, the bathroom was okay. Not much counter space but whatever. The balcony was useless, it was so small I didn't even bother sitting out there. One of the beds had a brown stain on the sheet skirt. It was so gross. The fridge had mold. And the bathroom sink faucet smelled disgusting every time we turned it on. Made me want to use bottled water when brushing.My immediate impression was not good. The staff I encountered with was pretty nice, but when we called the front desk and asked to find out where out tour bus would be picking us up, no one knew nor did they offer to help find out. How does no one know? Guests go on tours all the time. Luckily there was one guy that ended up to be helpful and guided us in the right direction.The elevator was slow and stuffy. It would stop and take awhile before actually opening. Parking was $35/day yet the parking lot was a disaster. I can't even explain how to get there and where to find the elevator because it was beyond confusing! Everyone we met was also confused. This wasn't a low quality hotel but it sure fit the description. I've stayed at old hotel before and have never seen mold or stains until this one.The pool was disappointing. It closed at 7pm and was nothing but a regular old pool that had a ton of sand and rocks at the bottom. I did appreciate the free towel and beach chair rentals that we were able to leave the property with.I'm not a high maintenance traveler but I also don't appreciate stains, mold, and weak customer service. I know this hotel has been around for a long time, I highly encourage them to step it up and provided a better experience for their guests. They are in a great location, they should do more to make this place desirable to stay at. Needless to say, I would not go back.","San Francisco, California","ohmygjenesss</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",12,2.0

You can walk across the street, to get to the beach, and you turn left, or right, there is all the restaurants and the shopping to keep all ages happy. Yes, the first floor buffet dining area is definitely very outdated, and badly in need of new face lift.

Still, I will offer a balanced look at my three day business stay last month at SPK. As I live in a city, I was happy when work was over and we moved on to more beautiful and remote settings in Oahu. But, here is a look at the GREAT, GOOD, BAD, and UGLY in my stay at the SPK as I saw them. Then, I will offer some Bottom Line-type comments . . .GREAT* Vibe: The SPK strikes a perfect balance of being a great setting for either a business or vacation traveler (or both as was my case). One would feel just as comfortable strolling through the spacious and modern lobby in either a suit or bathing suit (I did both). It has a 'beach' feel and yet would serve a business traveler who must be able to entertain, etc. * Location - If you must be in the city, this is the location. This might be my first time ever that I have wrapped-up work at 6pm, traveled back to my hotel, and still have had abundant time to go to a beach. Crowded yet beautiful Waikiki Beach awaits two blocks away. From the SPK's front door you have about a minute walk before you are in water. Also, there are a ton of conveniences available in shops just next to the hotel. GOOD* Splash: the on-site Splash bar is terrific and relaxing. They offer a variety of mixed drinks and a competent menu. There is almost always a live music act and a festive feel. * Staff: In limited interactions, I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. They were happy to help with searching tickets and offering information.* View: there are an abundance of pics here that prove you are going to have a great view almost wherever you are placed. And, it's not just a view from a window - your room will have a nice balcony to enjoy it from. BAD (Room for Improvement)* A Tale of Two Hotels: we felt the SPK was almost like staying at two hotels at times. I mentioned the spacious and modern lobby. It will have you feeling like you are staying at a much more expensive hotel at times. From there though, I had to step onto a cramped and outdated elevator that took me to my cramped and outdated hallway and then room, which was also a bit cramped and outdated.* A/C Unit: my room's a/c unit was huge, loud, and old. The temp control box was digital and modern but . . . the unit ran loud and was very weak, meaning it had to be on most of the time. UGLY* Nothing ugly to report in beautiful Hawaii. BOTTOM LINE* If you are coming to Waikiki for work or vacation (I don't know why someone would come to the only city in Hawaii for vacation), the SPK will make an excellent base. All that Waikiki has to offer will be at your fingertips at a price that compares nicely to other properties. I am already dreaming of the day I return to beautiful Hawaii.","Chicago, IL","ShoelessJeff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, IL</strong>",135,4.0

The restaurant has great daily happy hour cocktails and a good menu. The hotel lobby is modern and so was the room we stayed in. Great WIFI in the hotel and also in our room. The beds were super comfy along with the pillows. My one and only downfall to this hotel would be with one of the concierge staff members a lady called Terry. Terry was very rude and disrespectful. Terry greeted us whilst picking boiled lollies from jar and eating them whilst talking to us with her mouth basically full swirling these lollies around. Terry clearly did not want to help and assist us to book 3-4 tours that we wanted some information on and to book. Terry instead slid the brochures across the table and sent us on our way with not even explaining or going over anything. Guy, the other staff member who was also at the desk on the other hand was LOVLEY. Guy is your man to book tours and get helpful information from. STAY clear of Terry chewing her boiled lollies and scrolling through personal Internet sites not wanting to offer any assistance. Overall great location and very clean.

I read various Trip Advisor reviews and selected this hotel. Some people complain about the smallest things... and there's no making them happy. I ignore them. The price was right since we got it on air miles, but their prices were more reasonable than other Waikiki hotels. The only added cost that I didn't see value in was the daily resort fee. There is also a daily parking fee if you have a car. The location of this hotel is great. It's centrally located across the road from the beach right in the center of all the action and night life. It's easy access from the street is also a plus. The pool area is well maintained with plenty of deck chairs and side tables.

I get that price because its Waikiki beach but I also think that my room would have looked like something else then from the 1970s. Mismatched furniture that looked like it was from a garage sale from somewhere in Honolulu and the a/c was horrible. Not what I expected for a starwood property. The lobby area and the pool have been updated so that is fine.

The hotel is appeared nice and welcoming. The hotel is across the street from the beach and you can walk there in under a minute.Upon arrival at the hotel, check-in was very slow around 1:00 PM. There was a line of people and not enough employees. I waited about 10-12 minutes. Once I was checking in, I was told there were no rooms available, but they would notify me as soon as my room was ready (check-in is 3 PM). At 2:15, I had not heard anything so I followed up with another employee who checked and said my room was in fact ready. There was already a lack of communication as I never received a phone call as I was told.Being Platinum with Starwood, my room was upgraded. Also, as a Platinum member I received vouchers for free breakfast buffet and a free appetizer at the Splash Bar/Restaurant by the pool. Also, by staying at the hotel and being a member of Starwood, regardless of status, you receive 15% off at the same restaurant and discounted rates and two of the other Starwood properties (Sheraton Waikiki and The Moana Surfrider (a Westin property)).I was extremely surprised to find out that this Sheraton does not have a Club Lounge (I have stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki and they do as do most Sheratons).ROOM (2956)I was upgraded due to my Platinum status. The room was in the updated tower (I'm told one tower has been updated and the other has not). The room was nice, but smaller than expected. By no means was it tiny. The room had a partial city view and partial ocean view.The room had a king bed, 2 night stands, clock, dresser, TV, small desk and chair, coffee maker, mini fridge, closet with hangers, iron and board, and a safe for valuables. The room had a patio with 2 chairs and a table. The thermostat worked well and kept the room cold. There were 6 outlets and 4 USB outlets available for electronics.BATHROOMThe bathroom did not seem to be very updated. If it was updated, it was done cheaply. The shower-head appeared outdated and small. There was a shower/bathtub combination, a sink, and a toilet. There was also a hairdryer, but it only blew cool air so I'm assuming it's broken. There were 2 additional outlets available for electronics.Splash Bar/RestaurantI ate two times at the Splash Bar. The first time was simply for the appetizer that I received as a welcome amenity. The service was good and quick. The beef lettuce wraps were very tasty.My second experience, for dinner, was not as good. I arrived and was told to sit anywhere. The restaurant was only about 2/3 full. It was almost 10 minutes before I was asked what I wanted to drink. After I ordered water, it was another 8 minutes before she came back to take my order, only after I was making eye contact. Even then, I still had no water. After I placed my order, my water came a couple minutes later. The food took about 20 minutes, which was fine. I ordered a burger and fries which were tasty. I asked for my check when the food came because I was extremely tired and wanted to go to bed as soon as I finished. I had showed the coupon for 15% off food upon ordering as stated on the paper. The discount was not applied. I called her back to the table and told her and she said just put your name and room number on the slip and I will make the adjustments to your bill (I billed the food to my room). I did so, handed it to her and left. 10 minutes later as I'm literally getting into bed, the phone rings and it's the same waitress telling me that I in fact have to come back downstairs and fill out the new slip now. Clearly there was a mistake on her end. I had to get dressed just to go back downstairs and put my name on and sign the new slip. It was not my error. She should have had someone else bring it to my room to complete the new slip due to her mistake.BREAKFASTThe breakfast buffet was very good. They had made to order omelets (or other eggs upon request. They also had scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, rice, salad, French toast, pastries and breads, cereals, and fresh juice. They had no water sitting out. You have to request water if you want it. I'm unsure of the cost because I received it for free being a Platinum member, but if the price is reasonable, I would buy it.OVERALLOverall, I would rate the hotel 3.5 but you can't rate half points. Mainly, the points are being take off due to customer service. Upon check-in I was told I would receive a call when my room was ready. I was sitting in the lobby for an hour and fifteen minutes and I only found out it was ready because I checked myself.The updated room was nice, but parts seemed like they were done only partially.I was disappointed there was no Club Lounge. However, the appetizer at the Splash Bar was good and the breakfast buffet was tasty.Also, the customer service, for dinner, at the Splash Bar was poor at best.I have stayed at The Moana Surfrider (Westin), Sheraton Waikiki, and Sheraton Princess. The Westin property and Sheraton Waikiki are both beach front. The Sheraton Princess is across the street. The Westin property gives Platinum members a cooked breakfast and so does the Sheraton Princess. The Sheraton Waikiki gives Club Lounge access and breakfast is lower grade. The rooms are nicer at the Westin property and the Sheraton Waikiki than the Sheraton Princess.I would recommend the hotel if the price was much cheaper than the other two. Otherwise, based on this experience, I would opt for one of the other two if the price was comparable.",,JonnyBlaze777,103,3.0

Not sure if the resort charge is value but the reduction in tariff from other hotels marginally closer to the beach felt right. Loved lounging in the Splash Bar by the pool, thgough pool did close at 7pm. Happy hour at the bar from 11am to 6pm and very good quality bar snacks food. Staff were excellent generally.

Erin at the front desk made this an outstanding stay.

We stayed in one of the newly refreshed tower ocean view rooms, and it was FANTASTIC. Pool areas were very enjoyable with live music some evenings. Could not beat the location for being in the heart of Waikiki shopping and restaurants, and very close to the beach. I will definitely stay there again and FOR SURE seek out Erin to help us with our stay, SHE WAS OUTSTANDING, best customer service ever! Also they have a couple of rooms that you can use if you have a late flight and want to stay around the hotel after checkout to shower, etc before heading to the airport. VERY much appreciated that amenity, it helped extend our vacation by allowing us to go do things all day with somewhere to freshen up afterwards.

We got a great deal on the hotel given other properties in the area and price so giving this a 5 star rating. However, if we paid more, this would only be a 4 star rating.Room: We had 2 double beds. When we booked it said the rooms were queen size but they were double. The room was a bit tight with the 2 double beds but expected. The bathroom was dated and I could use an update. The floors were small blue 1980's tiles. Dated but functional. Pool: Given the size of the hotel, the pool was small but warm. It was good for us as our baby did not enjoy the waves or crowds at Waikiki beach.Resort Fee: the resort fee included beach towels, chairs, water and fruit at certain times throughout the day. The designated area at the beach was 100 yards from the hotel. Staff from the hotel would go to the area with water coolers filled with water and fruit and look for people with the hotel's beach towels. And odd system.... We only went to the beach once given that there was so much to do / see so felt that this resort fee was not worth it. There was also a $5 relief fund fee per day that was mandatory.....i don't understand this fee but it is on their website that they charge it.Overall, we had a great stay.

The hotel is in a great location, many shopsaround and very close to the beach. The hotel does actually provide shuttles form the airport, which I only found out after reading the information in our room. I emailed the hotel to ask for this information and never got a reply! I would suggest trying to get in touch as it could work out cheaper - $28 round trip depending on the number in your group. Our taxi cost is 46 one way due to traffic and an exit been closed. The room is small and better than I expected. We have a pool view room which does give a small ocean view which is nice. The bathrooms is really small. In the room there are wires which are lying around close to the tv and an extensions cord on the floor for more power points, I have never seen and am actually a bit concerning as we have a toddler with us who we need to keep away from the wires. The pool area looks nice and it seems that there is an allocated area if one wishes to go to the beach which is another nice touch. Overall I only booked this hotel as I was a Spg gold and decide to be loyal to SPG. Even though my agent suggested other properties such as the Hyatt or Hilton. Really annoyed I didn't listen as the other properties look more modern. Would not return or recommend the property. Can get better for the price.

Overall, I thought it was a good value for $127.06 + the $28 resort fee per night.All of the hotel staff was pretty friendly. They offered me both free breakfast + 500 points as a Platinum welcome bonus, instead of a choice between the two, which was nice. Because the resort fee includes free WiFi, and that is a Platinum amenity, they will also give me 250 SPG points, per night as an alternate benefit. They also offered me a voucher for a free appetizer at the bar, which was nice.They did upgrade me from a city view room to an ocean view room, that had a furnished terrace, and the views were pretty good. The walls were very thin, and I could hear people in the other rooms on both sides. The hotel does not provide in room glassware in the bathroom, but rather provides plastic cups, which I didn't really like. There were also not any bathrobes in the room, I'm not sure whether or not I could have asked for one...but I would have used it if it was there.The breakfast buffet included omelets which was great because that's not always included in Platinum breakfast.The hotel is about a 45-second walk to the beach and is well located; unfortunately, beach chairs are not provided, which is particularly disappointing given the high resort fee.Overall, I kind of felt like I was staying at a Four Points, and I'm not really sure how Starwood is defining the differences between the full-service Sheraton and mid-service Four Points brands.I might return if I got a rate of $127.06 per night again, but I probably wouldn't pay much more than that. I think I would be willing to pay 20-30% more to stay at a more upscale hotel next time, and I'll do a more diligent job looking for potential BRGs at other SPG properties.","New York City, New York","donotblink</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",4,4.0

The bell desk staff quickly helps you with the luggage.

The breakfast buffet has a variety of hot and cold dishes, which is very filling. Last year when I was there I could combine two coupons for one dinner buffet, and the selections were good too.

These visits were broken up into a two night, before proceeding on a cruise and then for a further four nights on conclusion of the cruise. While we were guests I can truthfully say that the Princess is a real member of Hawaiian Royalty. being an avid reader of hotels Emergency Procedures I was extremely impressed of how detailed a Plan and Policy had been developed. To me, this speaks volumes of the operational aspect of the Hotel. The Staff, well what can be said other than superb! Always helpful, professional, cheery and knowledgeable. Whomever we spoke to with a question regarding, well, anything, the member we had spoken to was able to give accurate and fast answers. We found the staff very cheery, and even in the face of a mad ""Aussie"" managed to try and understand the lingo. The furnishings and fittings were well maintained and when a slow draining sink was reported a maintenance engineer soon put it right. The ambience of the poolside area was beautiful and calming. The pool itself, was well maintained and evidence that hygiene takes precedence over convenience for guests was exhibited when the pool was closed because of a contamination issue. To me, I would rather not swim, than have a hygiene issue be overlooked. Access to shops, transport and beaches could not have been better.

The hotel is dated as the other reviewers have reported, but recent upgrades have improved it. It was to close, and be part of a complete renovation/demolition a few years ago, but then the developers lost approval connected with a larger project. Thus, I think that until that project did not move forward, the owner did not want to put any money into it. However, the recent renovations have improved the rooms, lobby and pool area. The hotel is located across the street form the beach, and if you pay for a high ocean room, which I recommend, you can see the ocean, part of Diamond Head, the pool, and the main street below. The money you save by staying across the street with an ocean view vs. on the beach with an ocean view is worth it. You can visit the other Sheraton properties on the beach and enjoy their bars and restaurants with room charges. The PK has all types of cultural activities, and nightly entertainment. The people who work there are all fantastic. If you want to go to Hawaii for fancy hotel room go somewhere else. If you want a nice room with a view for a moderate price, a good location, and wonderful staff, come here.

The look of the lobby/pool is misleading. I do not know how anyone would choose to spend 300 dollars a night here. We were just staying here one night coming from Maui; arrived at 7pm so we just needed a place to sleep until we caught our flight home the next night at 8pm. Hawaii to Canada is a 12 hour flight mind you so we were hoping to get a good nights sleep. For a Sheraton and an SPG/Marriot member the room we were given was as basic as you could get. I have never stayed at a Sheraton this horrible in my life. Should have been a Motel 6 more likely. For our last night in Hawaii we decided to go out on the town since we had the later flight the next evening. Came back to the hotel at 2am and was woken up at 7:30 in the morning to a CHAINSAW... at first I thought I was dreaming but then at 8am BANGING right above us with a hammer..... We were in Hawaii for a total of 18 nights and on the most important night to get sleep they placed us in a room with construction above us.... My husband called down IMMEDIATELY and the hammering stopped. I hope I can upload a video because this was absolutely WRONG! We talked to the manager and we could not fall back asleep so they gave us a later check out which was very nice of him. There really was not anything else he could have done to make us happy going on 4 hours of sleep. If you want a cheap vacation hotel this is your place but if you are looking for somewhere decent stay elsewhere (Hilton Hawaiian Village was excellent!).

This is my fifth holiday on Oahu and I thought I would try somewhere different to stay ie.. here at Sheraton Princess Kaiulani, because the price was right coupled with Hawaiian airlines flights. After checking in we weren’t too happy with our room of 2 double beds in the tower (my booking did state “or king bed”). We went back down and we were assured we would be given another room next day. Sure enough for extra money ($AU474) we were moved a few floors up with a king bed. I also want to mention ""Kathy"" on the reception desk was so helpful and friendly. As can be seen with the photo’s we weren’t top floor but our views overlooking the pool and entertainment stage as well as ocean views were excellent, the room was clean and tidy. I didn’t notice too much traffic noise from the 10th floor and it was nice to hear the live music from down below each afternoon. We didn’t hear any construction noise from next door either, but, we did hear our adjoining room neighbours from time to time through the connecting door, but not enough to worry about. Some reviews have mentioned the dated carpet and wallpaper in hallways, I actually like it like that, gives an original Hawaiian feel to the place. We enjoyed the fruit and water provided at the beach for residents of PK and the beach chairs provided are great. In my previous reviews I've mentioned how much I loved staying at Outrigger, which I did, but I now prefer the more peaceful and relaxing resort type feel of PK,... We’ll definitely stay here next year....Another thing I was rapt in, Alamo car rental is directly across the road, made it sooo easy for pick-up and drop-off.. takes about 30 seconds to wander over lol...

The public areas are bright, clean and modern and we had upgraded to a high ocean view and were certainly not disappointed the outlook was fantastic.

Good hospitality tray but only fruit teas so if you're a tea drinker take your own!! The bathroom was a bit of a let down, again very old fittings and a bit cramped it definitely needed a make over!!! The hotels greatest asset is its staff who generally speaking were terrific, attendants in the dining room were fabulous, ditto the poolside servers (especially Heidi) and the housekeeping staff and bell hops - totally excellent!!! Reception I didn't find that helpful I was fobbed off with a few questions (silly things like where can I buy one stamp?). The dining arrangements may not be to everyone's taste, breakfast lunch and dinner is buffet service, which is very very geared to the Japanese, Chinese and Korean visitors although there was bacon and an egg station at breakfast. Buffet never changed once though, EXACTLY the same each dinner service (and it's 42$ per head) ""a la carte"" was available we were told at Splash, the other restaurant. I've no idea what they think a la carte is but in my opinion it's not sandwiches, burgers etc so if you want a really good choice eat out, and the online menu is NOT what's on offer there!!!

(as it is known by all the local taxi cab drivers) on a family trip awaiting a cruise back to Australia. I was very impressed by the professionalism and courtesy shown by the staff members who assisted us in making the most of our 36 hours in Hawaii, particularly the concierge.The location is awesome for checking out the local sights - It is a manageable walk to the beach, and around US$5-$10 will get you to and from a lot of the shopping/restaurants/nightclubbery, although the Ala Moana shopping centre is a bit further out and Pearl Harbour/Pearl City is another story entirely.We were given a fair warning from the concierge that a taxi to the Pearl City shopping mall would cost around US$80 or take somewhere between an hour and a half to two hours to get there on a bus. Seeing that bus stops are conveniently located a short walk from the hotel, we opted to take the US$2.50 bus up to Pearl City, discovering that in rush hour, it certainly can take two hours by bus.The hotel features wi-fi, the price of which I believe is part of the occupancy charge for the rooms, but would seek further clarification. Further, there is a hot breakfast buffet featuring Western and Japanese options, distinctly featuring a staffed omelette bar to cater for Westerners and as well as nattou to cater for Japanese guests, or Westerners who have no idea what they are getting themselves into. I would make a snarky remark on the lack of Vegemite, to cater to Australians such as myself, but the hot buffet options were numerous and delicious and I found myself loading up with a bowl of miso soup (and some nattou) and even jerry-rigging a bagel with salmon and cream cheese using the available options. Top-notch.One last thing. The pool is a very nice one, cocktails are easy to come by and the staff are even happy to whip up something that is not explicitly mentioned on the menu (such as a long island iced tea) at reasonable cocktail-y prices.Tl;dr: Excellent base location for exploring the Waikiki area, little bit of a hassle to go further afield but overall nice rooms, great staff and an awesome island vibe!

A charming older hotel with an ambiance that newer hotels just can’t replicate. It’s open air lobby design takes advantage of the breezy trade winds. The lobby and pool were never overcrowded and the beach is just across the street. We booked directly with Starwood Hotels so got a great deal on a room. From the moment we checked in we were treated with a level far exceeding our expectations. Christina was not only extremely efficient and friendly but went out of her way to be helpful. Great attitude and customer service. She even remembered my name and room number the following day. Christina helped us enroll in the Starwood Preferred Guest program, gave us a box of chocolates on the spot then had our cards delivered to our room enabling us to activate and use them right away. Show the card at the dining room for 15% off, charge the dining room charges (not including liquor) to your room and get 25% off at checkout. The room was decent size, very clean and quiet, and had a mini fridge. Microwave available upon request. Our ocean view room had a large private balcony with a spectacular ocean view. Note to be careful during the day as the cement can get quite hot in the sun. The hotel is built on the former site of Ainahau, the home of Princess Kaiulani, who loved peacocks, hence the peacock theme throughout the hotel. Loved the Princess Kaiulani wallpaper in the lobby. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet, a great deal when using the SPG card. Coffee, juices, toast, pastries, oatmeal, Japanese breakfast (miso soup, natto, tofu, pickled vegetables), breakfast meats, fruits, salad bar and omelets to order. Walking distance to many nearby restaurants, jazz entertainment across the street, and an ABC discount store for snacks located a few doors down. We didn’t want to leave and ended up spending a great day poolside. We enjoyed our stay here very much!

She also called us right after we got to the room to see how we were doing, which I appreciated very much because it shows that she REMEMBERED us and that she CARED. Best customer service I have experienced at ANY hotel. Also, the location is PRIME! You're literally right across from Waikiki Beach, close to fast food chains and convenience stores, and just steps away from the best shopping and dining in Waikiki, including the new and improved International Marketplace which was right next door! The room was well furnished, clean and neat. The bed was VERY comfortable. The bathroom was well cleaned and the shower had the PERFECT water pressure and heat for a nice relaxing shower after a day of running around Waikiki. I also appreciated the AMAZING ocean view we had from our lanai (balcony). It's the perfect hotel for a short term or long term stay in the middle of everything Waikiki has to offer. Plus, the room rates are better than most hotels in the area, which is great for a Sheraton location.

What a rip off.Again, as a SPG member I received no other special service. No special check in, and in fact the staff were very beige. No one was exceptionally special with their customer service. Even walking past the pool towel boys every day there was no greeting. Everyone here is just doing their job to the bare minimum.

Its not a biggy at all. The lobby does not have A/C like most sheraton I've been to.Being an SPG Gold Member, I had a room upgrade to the 21st floor, with the ocean view. If you are not SPG gold and not willing to pay extra, you may get the lower level floor room, nothing wrong with that except from level 19 and below it has not been renovated, so I was told. The newly renovated room is good, the view is awesome :D I love it. You are right there on the strip, if you do not want to rent a car, this is a good location.The bed was very good, I sleep good at night, if I have to nitpick, some guest are a little loud at night, and I got woken up by the cleaners once or twice at 8 AM.Breakfast is $26 and dinner is $46, in room is well...extra. However, you live across the street from fast food restaraunt and down the street (walking distance) Chuck's Cellar is pretty damn good steak! (at a premium price of course) they do have singers come every night to host a show while you eat dinner.Parking is NOT free(most hotel in Waikiki isnt), $25 a day to include resort amenities, such as towels 250 spg point, the elevator for the parking garage is a little bit hard to find, however they do have it. Premium internet is $8 (?) a day for non SPG gold and platinum (you need to tell them its free, the IT guy does not know this, I actually had to point him to the website on SPG where it explicitly says complimentary premium internet) Premium internet is pretty fast, I was playing games a couple time (overwatch) and it dint lag (most of the time) Basic internet...if you want to do anything other than checking email, forget about it.There are no Spa or massage service here, instead they ask you to go across the street to the Westin (this is where you also go for the beach). The Massage service was good HOWEVER what they dint tell you upfront is a 21% service charge, kind of a hidden fees since they dont tell you, I was a little irritated when I saw the bills. the cost of my massage was 205 as stated on the pamphlet, I was able to get some SPG discount, however, after all cost and discount included it came to be $240 for a 75 min sessions, rip-off, considering other places do it for cheaper price.The shuttles from hotel to airport is $16 I dint personally sign up but I inquire about it.I also attended their luau, its a pretty good shows, I am not big into the whole luau thing however I was impressed. I also met the niece of one of the Olympian, she told me her uncle was the shiny Tonga guy that bear the Tonga flags in the opening ceremony.Overall its a good place if you are on a budget and want a SPG experience, however if you looking for a quieter place, with more of a luxurious resort feels, I think the Westin are better, you get what you pay for.so how would I improve this hotel? definitely the resort fees and service fees needed to be emphasize, the activity outside of the hotel need to be cheaper, they want $26 transportation to Hanamau bay (its $5 for first time entrance and other time it will be free) but if this is your first time in hawaii you wouldnt know any better, this is a Sheraton, however they charged like its the Westin, need to lower your prices a little bit for us 90% lower income folks.

On that point, the hotel does offer a nightly buffet for $42 and a daily breakfast buffet for $26, which by all accounts are very good.My room was satisfactory for my stay with two double beds and a very ""industrial"" bathroom, consisting of a toilet and sink like you would find in a gas station washroom (no vanity counter top with the sink) and a bath/shower combo. Maid service was very good and highly attentive during my stay. I don't normally leave a tip for cleaning staff, but I did this time. The furniture in the room is very dated and the hotel apparently has an upgrade plan according to their Twitter account, but I'm unsure what their timeline is. Something I should mention is that if you have a room that faces the pool, don't plan on going to sleep before 9pm due to the band that plays nightly.

We arrived at midnight following a late flight and was very impressed when the lady on check in said she would upgrade our room as we were a honeymoon couple! Great we thought! Until we stepped out the lift on the 18th floor, we were quite surprised by the huge change in decor compared to the modern looking lobby areas. Then we were even more surprised by how outdated our room was, it was clean but everything from the decor to the furniture appeared old and worn, similar to the other reviews, it was like stepping back into the 80's. The bathroom was tiny - you had to step over the toilet to get into the shower. We were then wondering, if this was an upgrade, dread to think what the original room was like! As it was then early hours of the morning we headed to bed. So imagine our horror after just a few hours sleep, being woken at 5:50am by lorries and construction noises. Now daylight, I went out onto the balcony to discover that our 'upgraded' room overlooked the construction site next door! Despite being 18 floors up, the noise was horrendous. After complaining at the desk, we were moved to the 22nd floor to a very lovely, very modern, very recently renovated hotel room on the other side of the building. We had no complaints at all about this room, it was lovely! Once the room issue was sorted, we had a lovely stay and had no other issues with the hotel. The location is great, the staff are lovely and very helpful. They're obviously in the process of renovating the hotel slowly but surely, it just would have been nice to have had some pre-warning about the construction site next door and not been 'upgraded' to overlook it!

When we booked we had requested a room on a higher floor that was less noisy after reading reviews. I followed this up by personally ringing Waikiki, prior to holiday to check my request had been received, yes but when we arrived we were still on the 2nd floor. It took 10minutes before reception could/ would find a room with a double higher up. This was disappointing as we have stayed twice at the Sheraton on Hawaii island - loved it and thought it may be similar here. The location is excellent, close to the beach and the main drag. That I think is it's best feature; it is in the middle of Waikiki and close to everything. Our room on the 5th floor, once we had sorted out the original problem, was fine,the clean and quiet if somewhat dark with not a lot of lighting for nighttime. The bed was very comfortable and bathroom although clean, looked, and was a little tired . There was a balcony for the room which was very pleasant. The hotel caters to numerous large tour groups and on one day my husband was physically pushed out of the lift while 2 other people from the same tour were helped into the lift. This was not a nice look. We did not say anything until the end of our stay when the manager wrote a note of apology, but still it should not have happened. . We asked for the room to be cleaned regularly which occurred; not always replenishing sugars and tea etc, but overall given the name of the hotel slightly disappointing. One could say the hotel is modern in part but plastic glasses in rooms is not really a chic look,nor great to drink out of especially when you are paying a resort fee of $us 25.00 pd We did eat at the restaurant one evening with a group of friends and this proved to be disappointing especially as because there were 6 of us we were automatically charged 20% tip when the meal and service did not warrant it.

Been here so many times I've lost count. This is my #2 go to hotel in Hawaii. I've never had any problems here. This review is an overall impression of the past 10 years and is not about a specific stay. Hotel: I would classify this hotel as upscale business travel or high turnover vacationer so expect crowds, wait lines and not much quiet. To be fair, this hotel is over 60 years old so some of the rooms and amenities are starting to show their age. However, facility is well maintained. Pool area and bar is nice and staff always friendly. Dinner buffet has good selection, never had a bad meal. Service: This is THE REASON why I like staying here. Front desk is always friendly and accommodating if I have a special request. Because of flight schedules I often arrive at 10AM-11AM but they always find me a room if my original one isn't ready. The extra breakfast coupon for being SPG Platinum is greatly appreciated. Room: Older rooms tend to be on the small side but have always been clean. Rooms facing poolside are noisy because of traffic. Linens are always clean and crisp. Five pillows on each bed is nice. Carpet, dressers, chairs, etc. are getting a rather worn and stained, about ready for an upgrade. Bathroom: (mostly) Clean, very small and in need of upgrade. Calcium buildup on shower heads and fixtures is a long running issue and gives a poor impression. Location: Heart of Waikiki. Literally across the street from Waikiki Beach. Walking distance to world class shopping and restaurants. Overall a very good hotel with a staff that makes it what it is. I always look forward to each time I stay here.

The rooms itself are fine! I Didn't have any problems with the room. We had a balcony overlooking the pool. The bed is super comfy and the bathrooms fine. The child's crib though is from the 80's and my son kept getting his foot stuck between the bars while he was sleeping which would wake him up screaming. The tour operator was great! He booked in all our tours nice and easy! The thing that I hated the most was the resort daily fee. Being from Aussie, I totally did not understand this extra charge which was about $30 a day. Not only that but when we checked in they said they needed a credit card to hold $10 in case we mess the room up. Which is fine but they never advised that every day they would be taking out the daily fee from the credit card as well!! I had only brought cash in to Hawaii so I never had to use my card and get charged the fee! After querying it with manager, he said it takes approx 30 days to get the money back off hold !!! What the! Lucky I noticed it after 3 days so only 3 days worth for taken out. I still don't know why the free wi fi and car parking isn't included already in the price and you have to pay this extra fee when you're there. The walls are paper thin. could hear our neighbours conversation very clearly and I'm pretty sure they could hear our son crying when he wakes up :( also the pool is very small!!

But what I could not grasp was how the hotel will not allow their guest to bring outside food and to have it be eaten outside near the pool. Obviously there are tables and chairs, but what makes the employees say to their guests that you can't eat outside food when right next to use there are other guest drinking drinks they purchased from the bar. I wish I got this employees name, but she literally told me to gather my things and to eat in my room! Overpriced food from the splash restaurant and buffet isn't even worth your time.

You will love it as much as we did. Not on the beach, but across the street from it, you can walk through the Moana across the street and enjoy drinks meals on the ocean. Beautiful theme, worth the time to learn the history, wonderful luau show, the beatles tribute was fun as well. Food was great, but the price tag was typical for a buffet on the strip, $24 breakfast, $50 dinner. The best part was definitely the people, ask for Kerry at the check in desk, she took care of everything we needed. Pay for the upgrade to poolside higher floors so you can see the ocean. I told Justin at the desk that we missed the kukui nut necklace making session and he took his own necklace off and gave it to me for my wife. That says it all. Watch out for the free photo session, they want $30 a picture or $200 for all of them. Food in the Splash bar was the best on the beach, small plates were a bargain. Pool was excellent, workout room was available 24-7. Resort fee included parking, which made it well worth it, other hotels fee was $30 and up not including parking.Stop comparing and hit the button, this is the one!","Perrysburg, Ohio","chinstahova</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perrysburg, Ohio</strong>",4,5.0

Our room was not ready when we checked in because the people did not leave the room until after 1pm even thought check-out time is 11am. Room was not ready until after 3pm (which is check-in time). We were given our keys and when we went up to the room -- - the housekeeper was still making up the room. The next day we were out of the room from 8am until 3pm and the room had not been 'made-up'. We had to find a housekeeper and asked if she would make up the room. They used to give you a welcome drink - - but not this time.

Once you fly first class you never want to go back to coach. They feed you a full course meal and you get to watch all the movies for free. Your seat reclines into a bed also they give you a pillow and a blanket. Plus you get to drink free.... Yesssss........ Ok back to the hotel it was really nice with a great view. The bathroom was clean but the bathtub could of used some updating. The location was a dream around so many stores and restaurants. There was a KFC across the street with really good chicken. We did a lot of shopping and if you get a chance to go buy some cookies from Honolulu Cookie. Waikiki is a great place to visit but to expensive to live.

Used the pool a lot and it was great, pool towels available, also beach chairs, water and fruit brought to you at the beach. Included in the resort fee of $25 per day. 2 bottles of water in the room per day and free wifi which worked well. Also included free car park if you needed it.

The rooms are spacious and offer everything you need king size bed, shower, bath, toilet, hair dryer, ironing board (which I found very handy), plenty of hanging space in the wardrobe, bar fridge and a safe which was great so we could store all of our money and important documents. The facilities are clean and well looked after and the staff are all lovely :-) The only thing I would say is if you're coming from Australia and happen to be on the flight that lands at 6am, make sure you get your travel agent to see if you can check in earlier otherwise you have to wait until 3pm which is a long day after you've been on a flight for ten hours, because all you want to do is shower and have a nap.

Noise was not an issue with the construction since most of it was completed and no work after 6pm. The location of the hotel was awesome, we were right across the street from the beach and paid half the price of the Hyatt which was right next door. Our room had a balcony with enough room for a table and two chairs. The hotel rooms are in need of renovation, but the size was fine for a family with two young children. We had a couple of issues during our stay, but each was dealt with promptly by the staff. Overall I would stay at this hotel again because of the location, price, and amenities available. Positives of the hotel:Location - close to beach, restaurants, shopping, grocery store, and anything else you might need or want.Swimming pool - even though it was not a heated pool it was still warm enough to swim in. I would say it was at least 78-80 degrees at the end of March.Lobby - was very inviting, had lots of areas for you to sit at and enjoy the breeze and have a ChiChi (which were delicious).Noise - or in our case lack of street noise in room 1263. Even with the construction and the busy street below we heard very little and no nose from the rooms next door.Staff - gentleman who does the kids activities was very friendly, restraunt and pool staff very prompt and friendly with service. Even with the amount of sand our children dragged in daily the cleaning staff made sure there everything was vacuumed and wiped clean. Bed - love their beds. I have difficulty sleeping on beds other than my one, but these were very comfortable and I was able to sleep through the night.Pricing - after a lot of research they had the best pricing for the location. The resort fee was very reasonable, it includes daily parking unlike other hotels which charges you separately for parking, wifi that worked well enough to stream videos, daily Kona coffee in the room, bottles of water daily and brought to you on the beach at certain times, towels and chairs to take to the beach, refrigerator in the room and safe in room. Negatives:Rooms are in need of a renovation, which I believe will be occurring this year. Pool closes at 7pm because of the nightly entertainment by the pool.Restaurant food was not worth the price. Even with a free voucher for a breakfast and dinner it was not good. The fresh cooked omelette were ok, but there is only a few items to choose from to put in the omelette. Pancakes were awful, boxed pancake mix is better than those served. Juice choices were good as were the choices of fresh fruit.Dinner buffet was so bad I didn't go back for seconds and I love to occasionally indulge at a buffet. The roast beef we had at a luau was better than the Prime Rib served, crab legs were not fresh as can be, sushi was very low quality, and whatever pasta dish they served one night was inedible. Dessert should be the best thing about a buffet and even that was a disappointment. They charge $42 per person for dinner and $24.50 for breakfast.",san jose,"tranberry27</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>san jose</strong>",46,4.0

But what they do instead is have a block of just normal non-upgrade rooms that they will give you till whenever after you check out. This was awesome as my flight was at midnight.

The building we stayed in was positioned side-on to the beach, meaning we had lovely water and city views from our balcony. The rooms were fairly average size for hotel rooms. They were clean but we found the housekeeping a little hit-and-miss as everyday at least one item that had been used wasn't replaced/replenished eg. cups, water, inconsistent number of towels supplied etc.We didn't have any issues with construction noise as we were on the opposite side of the building. We could occasionally hear it, but not enough to bother us. I could imagine it would be much louder on the side overlooking the construction site.Every member of staff I encountered was very friendly and helpful - pretty much every person I encountered while in Hawaii was like this.I would stay there again based on it being a bit cheaper than other places around it, though it would be nice to see the hotel and pool area get updated.

There is also a lot of pictures and items about Princess Kaiulani, which was a nice touch of history and information.We also watched the Polynesian show that was preformed in the small indoor stage, which was amazing. The fire twirler was my favorite part. The buffet was also amazing, with crab and sushi, plus plenty of other tasty dishes and deserts. Wait staff was good too, and kept the drinks coming.Tip: Sign up to the SPG group when you are at reception to get discounts on the hotel buffet. - we both signed up and got a free box of chocolate macadamia :)Our room was just what we needed: nothing too flash but enough to have an amazing night sleep, we stayed for 9 nights so we needed a comfy king bed every night and that's exactly what we got. There is a great little coffee machine in the room, and the TV and plenty of channels to choose from.

I had called a few weeks previous to confirm the reservations and let them know it was a special birthday for my wife and reason for the trip and was floored when we had our room upgraded and a bottle of wine and treat basket waiting for us. The hotel is perfectly located across the street from the main beach at diamond head. It's literally 5 minutes from room to beach. Don't forget to check out towels and beach chairs from poolside big kahuna station. Sadly some comments trash this place for outdated carpets and other small things. My view is that my wife is not giving birth on the carpets so I don't care if they have a little wear to them or were popular in the 80s. Everything was clean and smelled nice and that keeps my wife (me) happy. The room was clean and serviced nicely daily. The wifi was great. My advice is since you are paying the resort fee, take full advantage of the things it pays for. The pool is lovely and gets good sun exposure during the day. We took advantage of the professional photographer (in the lobby). We had called a few places prior to our arrival for family pictures and the hotel service was way cheaper and what I liked best, they weren't pushy trying to make the sale. Other merchants sell stuff daily also in a non pushy manner. My son's favourite daily event was helping the staff feed the Koi fish.

Our flight was coming in late on a Tuesday evening and I had called the hotel ahead of time to let them know my group was coming in late. They were very understanding and ensured me that our rooms we had reserved would be held. I also had asked that my husband and I's room be close to my mom and sisters and that is what we got. We were on the same floor we were just an arms length away. We stayed on the 7th floor room 718 close to the elevators. They stayed in room 702. Although our room was close to the elevators we did not get a lot of traffic noise in the hallway at all. Our room was facing the pool, but from a distance you could see the ocean and beach. I would consider this more of a partial ocean view. Both rooms were like this. Overall I felt the room was very comfortable and clean. You could tell in the the bathroom it's starting to rust in some parts, and maybe it could use an update, but it was functional. The only thing we had a problem with was the safe in the room. For the first few days we were there we had no issues with it. The last couple of days we were there it wouldn't work. I tried several times to reset it but it still would not open. Finally called the front desk and someone came and opened it. We had it reset and tried again, (this time I took all of ours stuff out and kept it with my mother in her room safe) and it still remained shut. Could not open it even after resting it. All I have to say is be careful. Yes, I did know my secret pin/code to unlock it. The location of the hotel was perfect. It was close to everything and a block in and half from the beach. The resort fee that we paid included the beach towels and chairs to carry down to the beach. We would check them out by the pool and carry them down to the beach area. You had to have them back b y 6 pm. If you sat in a certain area down by the beach the hotel staff came down a few times during the day offering cold water and fruits, which I thought was a nice idea.  We loved the lobby of the hotel it was great. The daily breakfast we had could use a tune up. It was the same thing almost every time. The only thing they switched out was the potatoes from roasted potatoes to hash browns and from sausage links to another kind of sausage.

We ended up having to stay 3 extra nights. We didn't want to completely blow out our budget so we chose the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani. The front desk staff are friendly and we were upgraded to a partial ocean view room on a high floor. The rooms are very dated, but clean. We had a balcony that overlooked the pool area and offered us a nice view of Waikiki beach. The building is old, but had gone through some renovations. One thing that has not been upgraded as far as I can tell, is the elevators. They are very slow and you can be waiting a long time. We took advantage of the beach amenities (beach chairs and towels and fresh fruit) and lounged at the pool one afternoon. This is not a beach-front property, but it is very close. There is only one option to eat within the hotel and it is a buffet and expensive. We never ate there. This hotel is very close to many great eating options in Waikiki. The only hiccup we had came on our last day. We had previously requested a late check out and when we got back to our room at 10:50am our key had already been recoded. I had to go down to the front desk, but since I was coming from the beach, I didn't have a photo ID, do we had to wait until security could let us back into the room. They apologized for the inconvenience, but said we should have come to the front desk that morning to get our key re-keyed. I think the system should have been able to be programmed to have our key work until our requested check-out time. Other than the one hiccup noted above, our stay was pleasant. It wouldn't be my first choice when we come back to Waikiki, but it suited our needs.",,Amanda G,15,4.0

The hotel location was convenient, there was a nice view from a sweet little balcony, the bed linens were clean and crisp with comfy pillows, and the TV had my favorite channels. :) The $26.18 amenity fee covered self-parking in the garage, which you do not frequently find in this area, so definitely a plus. However, there was an issue there that made me distrust the staff. Upon my arrival, the valet who met me in my car said there was no elevator to the tower, so he'd arrange for my bag to be taken to my room. Ok, no big deal--I'd expected to give him a tip anyway for watching my car while I was registering. The next day I discovered he had lied to me about the presence of an elevator. As I was driving up the floors in the garage I saw a big sign showing the way to elevator access to my building. Seriously! This made me pretty distrustful of this place as they clearly are more interested in taking advantage of their guests to the point of lying rather than serving the guests' best interests. So, feel free to stay here if you like--it's nice enough and convenient in many ways.

I had read mixed reviews of this place, and was a little worried, but there was no reason for my concern. The front desk staff was wonderful. Yes, the hotel decor could use some updating, but it was clean and comfortable, and after a day of sightseeing and an evening at a luau, we didn't really care about the color scheme. We were there on a Saturday night, and I was surprised to see that the construction site was in full operation, early Sunday morning, but we were high up so we didn't even hear the noise. It was interesting to watch. If we ever make it back, I'd love to stay in the same room to see the completed project. The resort fee included parking and breakfast, which was fantastic. It also included some pictures and other things, but we weren't there long enough to take advantage of those things.","Londonderry, New Hampshire","NHmomUSA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Londonderry, New Hampshire</strong>",64,4.0

The lobby carpet was also extremely worn and frayed and the whole property just had that feeling of having seen better days. The staff was very friendly, however, and they put us in a slightly better room for a small upgrade fee when I requested it.

I would recommend getting a high ocean view room to get the best view. On our return stay here we stayed in the ocean view rooms and there wasn't a lot of difference aside from the room being slightly larger. The main difference is the traffic through the hotel. The ocean view rooms have a separate lift tower and it is so lovely not to have to wait for the lift. The main tower gets incredibly busy and often have to wait for the lift and cram in with a lot of people. The pool area has a great atmosphere as does the lobby.

Yes it needs some refurbishment and currently is next to a building site ( but you cant blame the hotel for that!), but the rooms were clean and the bed very comfortable! The rooms had everything you would need! The staff were lovely! Nothing was a problem for them! Always called you by your name in the restaurant and bars. Service was good! AND every time you came into the hotel we were welcomed home! A lovely touch! Breakfast a bit expensive and slightly disappointing on choice not quality and quantity! Limited choice for American/ European tastes eg no cooked tomatoes, hash browns. Baked beans or mushrooms for the cooked breakfast! But the evening meal.....wow.... Excellent price to get a fresh crab, beef, and a variety of lovely food buffet! The soup delicious and the deserts to die for! The meals at the bar were also good! The local raw fish dish beautiful! And a good price for drinks! At the end of our stay we checked out but had a late flight! The lady on the desk told us to enjoy the resort - we got towels for the beach and pool! Free wifi and then access to a room to freshen up! We also access our cases at any time and never felt that we were pestering the bell boys- who are soooooo lovely! The concierge (unfortunately i cant remember her name) was fantastic!! She was helpful with giving us directions to places and advice on other things! Nothing was too much trouble! Tommy on the tour desk was also brill and he recognised us from two tears ago! Now thats service! So if you want a hotel that that is aesthetically perfect but doesn't care about its customers then this isn't the hotel for you!

Check-in was quick and smooth though the Ainahau elevators notoriously always had a line at the peak hours (checkin time, after lunch, after dinner).

This room has a balcony with a beach / pool view: while other conference-goers who got rooms next to elevators reported rooms plagued with a nonstop metallic clang (1548), mine was quiet and had good light-block curtains. The room temperature was comfortable.The breakfast buffet had broiled salmon, omelettes, broiled white fish, and hard boiled eggs. The omelette chef is amazing, but even with her speed, the line can be long. Most of the carbs are highly refined: white rice, sweet pastries, french toast, pancakes, etc. There is miso soup with a selection of add-ins (tofu, scallion, natto, e.g.). The cut fruit was fresh and thoughtfully cut (small enough to fit in the tongs): standard selection + papaya, for a tropical twist.Major caveat: the elevators are extremely slow. Allot 15 minutes for an up-down trip: sometimes you luck out and three in a row come, but usually you have to wait; moreover, elevators that stop at the lobby close quite aggressively -- if you don't get in them right away, they'll be whisked away to another floor before you can hit the up button to call one again. I have avoided returning to my room (to get something, e.g.) because the elevators could be so slow.Check-in was smooth and the desk was happy to send toothpaste up for me, which was much appreciated. My room key stopped working one evening, and I was able to call the front desk for help: a security person came promptly (he must've lucked out with the elevators) and got me a new key.It's a good room, but I wouldn't pay these prices myself.

We were allocated room 408 in the Princess Wing, overlooking the pool with a great view of the stage for each night's entertainment (the stage view from some rooms on levels 2 and 3 may be impeded by foliage). We even had a small view of the ocean. Each evening's entertainment poolside was different but all very pleasant as we had our dinner on the balcony (lanai). The room itself was comparatively large with a huge king size bed, large flat screen TV, a Kona coffee machine, iron and ironing board. Minimal noise from the Main Street. The furniture was ""beachy"" - just what we expected in Waikii! The room was very clean and well-serviced daily in the afternoon. There was an ice machine on our floor, which was very convenient. The balcony was in shade in the morning, in sun in the middle of the day and then in shade late in the afternoon, which was great. The fridge was the coldest we had experienced at any hotel and large enough for an evening bottle of wine and breakfast goodies from the adjacent ABC shops and street markets. The bath was low-set which meant easy access to the fully adjustable shower. The safe was also quite large and easy to use. Unexpectedly, we were given a lovely fruit basket compliments of the hotel on the first morning. Plenty of lounges under umbrellas poolside. There is a laundromat (washers and dryers) for $3 a load in the basement, with a small sitting area. The resort fee of $26.18 covers parking (we didn't need it), wifi, daily water, phone calls (including 1 hour to Australia every day), beach towels, beach chairs and fruit & water in the Sheraton section of the beach.

You cannot beat the location for proximity of what's happening in Waikiki. I arrived from a private home in Honolulu by Uber at 7 am in the morning of my one night stay. No rooms were available yet for my price reservation(which I made the day before online). I was upgraded almost immediately to a partial Ocean view on a very high floor. I was able to see Diamond Head from my balcony and see the beautiful Moana Surfrider in full splendor right on Waikiki Beach. I had my suitcases delivered and rested for about an hour. I headed down to the lobby and low and behold, an old acquaintance from 20 years prior was still making and selling his jewelry in the lobby. I had just purchasde a ukulele and had it with me, I asked if he played and play he did!! He is 82 years old now, but 20 years prior had taken my friends and I on a tour of the highlights of Oahu, including a great Chinese lunch. Boy we laughed hard all those years ago. Even though he had no memory of us, I enjoyed his sharp mind and awesome ukulele playing. Since I was temporarily alone, I made reservations for the last seating of High Tea at the Moana Surfrider which is also a Sheraton property that I have stayed at several times. Now I was treated like a Queen, seriously. Not sure why. It was a highlight of my stay in Oahu for 3 days.

(It also includes water which we already got daily, and internet which is free in the lobby, and phone calls which we had no need for). The resort fee is $25.00 per day; the same price as daily parking, so the only other benefit would have been to use internet in our room instead of the lobby. Unreal that the policy is to add it to the whole stay...all or nothing. How absolutely ridiculous is that? So we went with the parking fee for the 3 days. They would have charged us and extra $100.00 for nothing!!! The front desk staff have little to no latitude to adjust issues; and have to check with management. When we arrived, our room overlooked a giant noisy air conditioning unit. To move us, a manager was called at 4 in the morning! We were with a group of executives on a special rate, and I could not believe the poor room we got. No foresight for future business with such a group. Our view was a construction site next door and they start work at 5 in the mornning, even on weekends. Aside from the hotel (and this is a review of the hotel), I loved Hawaii. I would never stay here when there are so many views to be had; and so many nice pools with sun.

You can also have use of chairs etc to take across the road to sit on the beach which was close and gorgeous.

Building is supposed to be completed by Aug 2016, so over the next few months noise levels should start to improve, as internal construction of the building will start. Reception did tell me that these rooms are allocated to rooms booked through an alternative source ie: Travel Agent, other booking agent & the Eastern Side Rooms facing away from International Market Place are allocated to bookings made direct with the hotel. However you can call up & ask for a Supervisor once your booking is made & ask for a East facing room. It wasn't always pleasant sitting on our balcony when construction was happening, but we didnt go to Hawaii to sit on our balcony from 7am-5pm & in reality we were away from our room from 10am-4pm most days. Room was fine but felt Bathroom was dated, & in need of updating, along with general mantienance of the room ie -our iron board was broken & fridge shelf broken.My biggest gripe would be the poor ventilation as you neared the lefts located by the Restaurant Area as we were coming & going from our room. It was very overpowering, & a couple of times made me feel queezy.Even though I have said Cons, in the big scheme of things they arnt major.

It had been recently renovated. I was still a smoker back then so wanted room changed to a smoking room. New room was located a few floors up and although it hadn't been renovated like the first room and looked a little worn, it had a great view of the pool area and famous Waikiki [?] Beach . All rooms at the Princess have great little balconies with glass sliders. If other high rise buildings didn't block it, we could have seen down the whole beach area to Diamond Head ! The breakfast buffet was impressive with the usual expected foods plus a lot of Asian specialties ! Dining was either out in the open near the pool or inside under a covered area with view.

If this room was an upgrade, I'm so afraid to know what the other rooms must be like.For those of you who know my reviewing style; I'm detailed- so if you like skip to the info you need.Parking: No valet. Is self-park and you retrieve from a large garage yourself. If you are on a budget, may be a plus for you. Upon check-in they do bring bags up to your room, so you don't completely get around tipping.Received no flower Lei greeting upon check-in.Pool- is small. It seems most pools in the area are small.

Maybe you like that?The Beach: Put on your bathing suit & drag your beach stuff across the street, through the hotel, down around. Come back wet & cold. Get the idea. Staying at the beach is better, then across the street if you can. The Lobby: Not sure what the style is suppose to be. Contemporary, retro, tropical. It's just strange & no working. They have lots of posters for cheesy, magic shows & Elvis tribute shows that no one would attend unless they were part of a prepackaged tour group. The elevators were hot & stuffy.Room: The hallways were so hot, obviously did not have A/C. The hallways smelled badly. The room/suite was straight out of 1950. Maybe they thought it was the Hawai'i 5-0 suite. We were greeted by a harvest gold love seat, avocado green bath fixtures, and formica counters. The kitchenette had a Scotsman mini-fridge. I didn't actually check to see if it was still running. It had really low ceilings, old draperies & old furniture.The a/c unit rattled loudly.We were on the 28th floor. It was super loud, with traffic & construction noise from the International Marketplace, directly next door. There was a large balcony, with double sliders across the room. The huge balcony could be a big plus, except the balcony furniture was rusted & broken. Then someone had apparently tried to repair it with some duct tape. The balcony had a side ways view of ocean.Bathroom: The mirror was so old that the shine had rubbed off it in many places, it was also missing part of the metal. The avocado green bathtub montrostry/shower had a see through window with a retro frosted fern window looking out over the bed.Sleep: Earlier in the day, I took a nap. I awoke to something crawling on me. It was a small ant. There were several ants in the bed & on the floor.

(not working) ... still like the ground floor pool and location its major asset. Troubles from the get go, booked a vacation package from wesjet and room was not what i booked. Long story short they said i booked through a 3rd party and becsuse someone was willing to pay more they got the room. 40 minutes later after arguing i got to settle in. Some days it looked like they started cleaning room but didnt quite finish (pillow left on floor - no biggy) also bird crap on lanai did not get cleaned whole stay, not going to get into everything but certainly did expect more. Tip: when you book a room add 25 dollars a day to it (resort fee) also if you want good view even numbers 48 to 60 (21 floors up) this view will get you beach facing diamond head. really dont know if i will be back there, too bad was a favorite :-(Dont know if airlines care if there packages are being changed or not but will find out.

It had a balcony that overlooked a construction site and the outdoor furniture so filthy I couldn't even sit on it. The room was barely big enough to accomodate both our suitcases and the smell immediately started playing havoc with my sinus. We had when booking asked for a refurbished room as a lot of the TripAdvisor comments had said that parts of the hotel were old and smelly. We had made our booking as part of a package through a holiday group and we emailed them to request it was really important that we didn't get dank smelly old carpeted rooms. My husband planned this trip for our adult kids and their partners as a family holiday and we had been to Hawaii twice before and been so happy with everything. First time staying at a VBRO property on the Northshore and then the Westin Surfrider at Waikiki and the 2nd visit staying at the Hyatt (our favourite). The children's rooms were slightly better in that their furniture appeared newer. My husband asked us all to stay put and not to unpack and he would be back. He came back 45 mins later and said he had managed to get rooms for us all at the Hyatt across the road.

In truth, that's about the only saving quality of this hotel. That and maybe the convenience of the parking garage I suppose.The main lobby is definitely outdated, with odd smells wafting in the air. Staff and service are average. The clean up crew was friendly, very pleasant to deal with, but calling down to the front desk was a hassle every time, consuming five minutes of hold time, even just for quick queries.We had originally booked ourselves for three two queen size bed -rooms, and one king size bed-room. Upon arrival, we came to learn that we had been placed in three king size bed-rooms. When we called the front desk, they stated that when they were booked, the request for said rooms was just something for consideration and not necessarily a reservation. Disappointing, and the front desk person said they would contact us as soon as the rooms opened up. There were other hurdles in just trying to get situated but I'd rather not elaborate. More importantly, inevitably they were able to get us one more room that had the two beds. Now the rooms. they were just subpar, lackluster isn't even a fitting word. The bathrooms smelled, and each room had a differently tiled bathroom, some older than others, definitely not what you'd expect from a place that specializes in accommodations. Rooms were tight as well and the amenities were just old. Having said all that, the company we were with, and the convenience of everyone being on the same floor and the hotel's location made for somewhat of a positive experience.

(I was traveling alone and walked everywhere.) I was very surprised by the open air lobby, but this was my first time to Hawaii. I didn't know what to expect from these big name hotels on the Waikiki strip. I guess the open air setting is common. But the lobby at SPK must have been recently renovated.I would have given this property the highest rating was it not for the outdated room that I had, which also seemed partially ready upon my entering. (Clues such as a chair in the wrong place and the trash & recycle bin were on top of the desk.) IMO - some minor renovations could do these rooms wonders! The other issue was that I had a slow draining tub. My 16th floor room had a balcony that faced the city view. Directly below me was the construction of the new Marketplace shopping center. I could see a tiny sliver of the beach/ocean. Although they did warn me about my city view (versus the beach), they did not mention the construction, which is happening all over Honolulu. I know the noise bothered some other reviewers, but I'm a heavy sleeper, and it really didn't bother me. The construction pretty much starts up at 7 am, but will stop immediately around 5 pm. Besides - you're not supposed to be in your room much... you're supposed to be outside enjoying Hawaii!Overall, I had a great time at the SPK.

We were excited by the presentation of the entrance foyer, it was grand, modern and very impressive. It was from here that the dissapointment began. After an 11 hour flight, 1 hour to get through customs and a 45 minute shuttle service to the Sheraton, we were greeted at reception with ""we don't have a reservation in our system for you"". Shock horror, despite having documentation showing our reservation it took nearly an hour for the young guy to find us a room which was supposed to be equal to what we had paid for. We were put on the 29th Floor in a room that looked like it had not been renovated since the 80's and the bathroom was well in need of some work. The room had a view of the city but the promised ocean view was only visible if you leant forward or looked around the corner. Surprised and DissapointedFor our inconvenience??????, we were offered a free breakfast for two and two free cocktails. The breakfast was dissapointing in that the bacon was rock hard, the juice watered down to the max and birds flying/landing in the uncovered fruit platters on display. I'm glad it was free because it saved the staff further complaints. When we reported the birds in the fruit platters, they were moved but we did receive a smug look from the lady who we pointed this out too. Also during breakfast, we observed and heard two female staff members arguing over who was responsible for doing what at a certain time. This occurred in front of all the customers seated ( about 6) at the time. Very unprofessional. Surprised and DissapointedWhilst looking to confirm a tour the following day with the Concierge, we were advised that this was not her job and we should do it from our own room where it was free. Surprised and Dissapointed.On the positive side the two ladies who looked after the both of us at the Splash Pool Bar were amazing. Lea and Angie (I think) were there to do anything they could to make our stay enjoyable. Great Service ladies.The bed in the room (King Size) was brilliant. With an upgrade to facilities the Sheraton could be a great place to stay whilst in Hawaii.

So happy with the service at the hotel. We were in a pool view room and when we were not out exploring we were relaxing by the pool, swimming and listening to the bands play from our balcony at dinner time. The hotel had wi-fi included in our package which was great. We were always greeted with a smile from Elvie when we were leaving our room. The room that we stayed in had a fridge and a safe. The only thing which I think would have been great would be to have a kettle in the rooms, but there is a coffee place at one of the hotel entrances so it wasn't that big a deal. The hotel is close to the beach shops and places to eat so if you are there just to relax you don't need to go far for a meal etc. Would definitely stay here again.

Except for the lack of tea making facilities. Coming from Australia we kind of expect a jug and tea and coffee making facilities, maybe a packet of cookies, a little carton of milk in the fridge? Not so here. Just a small coffee percolator and terrible creamer - those tiny little pots of UHT milk/cream. So just a tip...brink your own milk and tea bags and ask at the front desk for a jug. They may have one. There was one in the room where you get ice which we purloined for our stay.Beds were comfy - amazing pillows, crisp white sheets as you would expect. We had nice views over the pool area. Balconies are very tiny. Air-con is very cold. Bathrooms nice.Concierge staff were sometimes helpful, sometimes seemed to speak limited English (LOTS of Japanese tourists in Honolulu and so it seems concierge staff are hired accordingly). Don't make the mistake of asking the tour organiser guy questions instead of the concierge. Their desks are near each other. The tour guy just wants to sell you tours obviously so his 'knowledge' is about tours, most of which you could do by catching a bus or even a taxi for less. Ask the concierge about those :)Restaurants and bars are good. Cocktails delicious and food tasty and reasonably priced. Good value 'resort fee' too including wifi, towels around the pool, water bottles in your room and a few other things.Location is perfect for exploring Waikiki and shops and restaurants.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at Sheraton Princess Kaiulani and would definitely consider a return visit.",,Sharon F,0,4.0

We were sitting by the front door, waiting for a bus to take us to a breakfast orientation at another hotel and have breakfast while there. Near the time for the bus to arrive, I had a ""medical issue"" that worried me to the extent that I told my wife I needed medical attention NOW! She alerted the doorman, Melvin, that i was indistress and he immediately alerted the hotel security staff. Within 5 minutes, three security staff were at my side and giving me first aid and gathering information on my condition. They called for an ambulance and EMT's at once and I was in the bus, hooked up to an EKG, and feeling much better within no more than 10 minutes more. They suggested I go to Docs On Call, a walk-in clinic, at another hotel for further tests. I was taken there by one of their cars and got to see a Doctor within 30 minutes. If I had experienced a cardiac event, had it not been for the quick action of the hotel staff, I would have most likely expired. I later found out that the Sheriton hires off-duty fire/rescue people to take care of any medical issues that may come up at their hotels. I am forever grateful for their quick attention and quality care. Whatever emergency plans the hotel has, they were followed to the letter.  Now, to the revue, the only thing we were even mildly concerned about was the ""resort fee"" that we had to pay and had no choice in. We were charged a daily fee for all 7 days for things we would never use, such as, parking on the property, a photograph that they chose the pose to give us for ""free"", and in-room wi-fi. At check-in we were given an upgrade to a corner room for no additional charge, but that room faced the construction going on right next door. This was a mildly annoying thing since they started work around 5:00 or 6:00 AM and worked until around the same time at night. The room was quiet enought hat we slept through most of the noise, but light sleepers would probably benefit from a room on the other side of the hotel. The housekeeping staff was EXCELLENT! Our room was cleaned and made up every day and was always neat and clean despite the fact that we left swim suits and other clothes and items strung all over the room as typical hotel guests do. We received a bottle of Champagne since we were staying over our anniversary and got two bottles of water every day. We had two refrigerators in the room and a nice flat screen TV. The food on the buffet was VERY good with lots of fresh fruit every day and a large selection. The prices were high, but so was every other eatery in the area, so no surprises. The hotel staff was always very polite, very efficient, and catered to our every whim. The beach was right across the street and access was very easy. I would never pay for a beach front hotel when the short walk gets you to the same place. This hotel was worth every penny we spent on it and we will stay there again if we decide to go back to Hawaii. The bad revues others have given this hotel only prove that some people just can't be pleased no matter what you do for them. I witnessed a guest getting VERY ugly with a check-in staff member for a problem that the ""guest"" created, but still wanted them to fix it. Some people are just idiots.","Canton, IL","tlmkr7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canton, IL</strong>",1,5.0

The Sheraton Princess K was one of the more affordable options with good reviews. Location was TERRIFIC. From our pool-view room we could see one of the colonial towers of the Moana Surfrider, just a block from the beach, close enough to feel we weren't stranded in the cheap seats. The lobby sets the aloha tone with its open doors, lanai-style, leading to pool, lush fan palms, pretty pocket grotto garden and street side access. Our room was ready for our 3PM check in and the front desk clerk was efficient and friendly. When we first drove into the parking garage the self-parking sign was posted at $40/night. Ugh. The extra charges of travel started piling up in my mind. I gave my credit card to the clerk at check in and he stressed the benefits of paying for the Resort Fee. Sigh. More charges. However, this sounded *optional*. (We've stayed at a Sheraton in Newport Beach, CA and the resort fee is not optional there.) Do tell! For $26 we get free 24 hour parking, premium internet access ($14 value), 2 complimentary bottles of water, free beach chair rental and towel service on their section of the beach (which we didn't have time to visit) and a room upgrade from city view to pool view with a very nice balcony. Sign me up!Our room was quiet, clean, with comfortable beds, extra pillows, coffee maker, good water pressure in the shower. I withhold one star for grimy smudges on the wallpaper in the bathroom (it is an older hotel) and no elevator in the 5 story parking garage. We had to park on the top level and thump, thump, thumped our way down 5 stories with luggage. Even though we travel light our bags are bulky. I'm fit but also 59. So, yeah. The handicapped access ramp in the hotel lobby doesn't lead anywhere so you can't roll luggage down that into the garage. Next time one of us waits downstairs with the bags while the other person parks & walks down. Live and learn. Overall, I would definitely stay here again!

After a 9 hour flight it was great to use the hospitality room to freshen up, this room has a shower, toilet, and lounge and you have the use of it for 1 hour.As we arrived early in the morning I did not expect our room to be ready, but when I went down to return the key from the hospitality room, Sharon informed me that our room was ready. Had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the pool and to the left we could see the ocean. On arrival to the room it was great to find that the air con had been left on, left this on all night and was never noisy. I work in the hospitality industry and I gave the room a thorough inspection and found the room to be spotless. The only downside was that you could hear the shower/toilet in the adjoining room but this is the norm in most hotels.Daily housekeeping was always great, always had the garbage empty and fresh towels. Included in the resort fee was 60 minutes of long distance calls per day, which I used to call back home and two bottles of water daily, don't know what the car parking was like as we didn't use a car. Didn't eat at the onsite restaurant or order room service either so can't comment on these.The resort is in close proximity to everything, only a couple of minutes walk to Waikiki Beach and there is a Subway, Burger King and KFC across the road as well as a convenience store. Is also in walking distance to heaps of shops, markets and restaurants. We got the local bus to Walmart and the Ala Mona Shopping Centre. for $2.50 per adult each way, and $125 per child, but used a taxi to get home which was only $20 including tip.Spent the whole day at Ala Mona Shopping Centre, which they are extending and had Bubba Gumps for dinner. We also went to the Premium Outlets, which was a waste of time, mainly high end stores and not many of them.Went to Pearl Harbour with Roberts Hawaii bus company for $86 per person which included the bus and entry to Pearl Harbour, the Arizona Memorial and tour of the Mighty Moe, Only downside was that it didn't include time to visit the Aviation Museum, so I would pay extra and do that. Also It is a working naval base and you have to take your photograph ID or Passport with you and you have to put all bags in a locker, except for what you can fit in your pockets.Did an Island Tour with Hawaii Turtle Tours, they take you to Diamond Head, Blow Hole, Makcapu, Secret Beach, Chinaman's Hat, Lale Point, Sunset Beach, Turtle Beach and the Dole Pineapple Plantation. If your lucky you can swim with the turtles but unfortunately we only saw 3 and they were in the shallows on the rocks and due to the sharpness of these we were unable to swim with them. But it was still a great tour in a mini van, so is a bit more personal than being on a big coach.Had a fantastic stay, all the staff were very friendly and helpful and room was always clean and tidy and only have positive memories.","Newcastle, Australia","Mary- Jane V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle, Australia</strong>",8,5.0

If you want to stay smack down right in Waikiki, by the main street Kalakaua Ave, and just need to cross two streets to be on Waikiki Beach, close to the little pier, this is the place to stay. Walking distance to just about everything in Waikiki. And the rooms are ok, nothing more, nothing less. I arrived a day late for my pre-paid room, Tower high floor ocean view, and missed one of my three nights due to delayed long-haul flight from Europe. Knowing the money was lost (hotel gained) I asked if there was anything they could do to maybe comp me a little, as a small token of appreciation for having -given- them my money and not even stayed there. Well, I couldn't get a better room, cause I already booked one of the better one they could offer, nor could they do anything else… So no, they could not do anything… Really?? For the price I paid, and thinking the Sheraton name had a certain standard to it, I have to say I was a little disappointed. The hotel was old and dated, and the friendliest people were the mades and the concierge, not impressed by the hotel it self or the front desk. The day I was leaving I had a knock on my door, and there was an employee with a gift from the manager delivered to me. I was quite baffled about this, I accepted and closed the door. In the gift basket there was a card, and my suspicions were confirmed; this was not for me! So I quickly ran out in the hall and found the guy who brought it to me, and said this was a mistake - this was not for me. Of course he was very happy that I was so honest, but that is just me. Now, my concern is how the hotel did not know that I was still in the room, and not the new guest? I had not checked out, and obviously the new guest had not checked in… Another point off for the front desk who should really keep track on things like that. I had a whole day to spend in Waikiki the day I was leaving, so I asked for a wi-fi connection - cause the one I used got disconnected when I checked out. (It was heavy rain that day so didn't feel like walking around). They tried to give me several codes, that did not work, but they could not give me any other connection, like the one I had. But I could use their computer. I needed wi-fi to get in touch with my friends through iMessage (not having a US cell). So that didn't help me at all. And they were not willing to help me in any other way, and I could not pay for a connection either. Luckily I know Starbucks and Jamba Juice are very wi-fi friendly =) The pool area is a lot smaller than it looks from the photos, and its also right by the lobby, so I felt a bit on display from more people than necessary. I feel in a pool area, there should be mostly pool people, not every single person passing through the lobby…Oh, and just one more thing: right next to the hotel, they are doing construction on a huge area, so if you stay at that side, it might get noisy very early in the morning.","Haugesund, Norway","LadyCeci</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Haugesund, Norway</strong>",18,3.0

The resort fee was a little crazy but it seems everyone has it now. We did appreciate being able to get towels and chairs to take to the beach across the street. All staff were friendly and welcoming and attentive to our concerns (had to call the front desk twice; once regarding the shower head in tub - it fell from the wall when support broke and once when the toilet tank wouldn't fill after flushing). Both times I called someone was there within 5 minutes and fixed the problems. Also got to use a hospitality room for showering the evening of our flight home since we checked out at the normal time.

However, we decided to give it another try on our visit in September 2015. We were pleasantly surprised. They updated the entire lobby/public areas. As SPG gold members, we were upgraded to an ocean view tower room (Ainahau). It was a beautiful room, great view, clean, and perfectly met our needs. The maids took very good care of us during our stay. We ate in the restaurant and the bar and enjoyed good service. The parking structure was easy to get in and out of. Rooms in Waikiki are typically small and parking can be a problem. The Princess Kaiulani is no exception; however, in all of the hotels/properties we have stayed at over the last 30 years, the Princess does a good job at trying to make it easier/better for it's guests.","Newbury Park, California, United States","Teri T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newbury Park, California, United States</strong>",8,4.0

The rooms are pretty standard, but whoever cleans the rooms did awesome- my mom must have brought the whole beach with her one day and left tons of sand everywhere, the room cleaners made the room like new.

From booking to check-in to check-out, everything went well. The ease of everything enhanced my trip. Here’s what I loved: 1. The room – well appointed, balcony with a south facing view, 42-inch flat screen high def TV, private, small fridge, desk and a full-size dresser. 2. Wi-Fi – decent internet speed was accessible everywhere on the property. 3. The location!!! The hotel is caddy-corner from Waikiki Beach. This means the hotel is next door to the best shopping in the Hawaii, and about a 200 – 300-foot walk to Waikiki Beach sand and water. 4. Outside services – the pool and outside services are in front on the hotel but surrounded by tropical gardens, walls, and a black lava koi pond. The outside team assists with the pool, but more importantly you can check out then take your towel and a foldable chair to the beach. This process was really easy, and there was never a wait. We changed are towels 5. The lobby of the hotel is expansive and Lanai style so you constantly get to feel that warm Hawaii air. 6. The pool is warm and clean and there are plenty of chairs. I really liked how the pool had a real deep end that was over 8 feet. 7. My wife and I work out almost daily so having a real gym was awesome. They had high-end treadmills, ellipticals, weight machines, but what I thought was great is that not a lot of hotels have, is free weights. 8. Water! The hotel has a water dispensing service that is sourced from an artisan well off-site. We were able to fill up our water bottles with delicious Hawaiian spring water, so we saved a ton of money on not buying bottled water – we also received 2 complimentary bottles in our room per day. 9. The Elevator – my wife loved this; the elevator close door button works! As soon as you push button or select a floor the doors close and you’re on your way. We probably saved 30 minutes over the course of our trip by never having to wait on our elevator. 10. Parking – parking was convenient and included in our resort fee. The parking is not on the main street that goes up it down, it along with the formal entrance is on a side street which means getting in and out is a lot less stressful. 11. Communication – I communicated with the hotel via email, over the phone, and on Social Media. Every communication was prompt, and courteous. Because they were so attentive on Social Media when I was trying to decide where to stay, I chose this hotel. Shootout to Esther for making this happen. My stay here was fabulous, and pricing was so much less than adjacent properties, and there was so much more included in terms of services than a condo rental. It was a real resort experience, with all the amenities and convenience that comes with it. The only downside is that I didn’t have more time to stay there (we were only in Hawaii for one week), but two weeks or ten days even at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani would have made this Hawaii trip even better.

The balconies are large and feel private. In the evening, when there is a band playing pool-side below, you don't want to leave. - staff is very friendly and very accommodating.- great location As for the cons:- I think your experience of this hotel will greatly depend on the room you get. Ours had updated linens but otherwise needed a major refresher. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the ceiling had water stains, and our bathroom could have definitely used some fresh, no moldy grout. Beside the entrance to our door someone had written on the wallpaper with a sharpee and there didn't seem any effort to remove it. - I think the rooms good use a bit better cleaning or perhaps supervision. A wipe down of the outdoor seating would have been nice. Our tv and lamps were also really dusty and the carpet was in pretty bad shape. - The room across from us ordered room service on night and left their plate in the hall that same night. It was not picked up until almost a full day later. Again I'mnot sure what the process is for room service pick up but a day sitting in the hall seems like a long time.- I understand this is an older hotel and I actually love it for that.

Sure, the hotel is quite a veteran of Waikiki accommodation and the rooms are not refurbished but my room had a sweet sleeper bed, widescreen TV and a clean bathroom.For travellers to Waikiki who won't be staying in their room much during the day it is a great hotel with a great location and you will save lots of dollars!The staff are friendly and helpful, check in was easy and early so that is a big bonus rather than waiting around all day for your room to be ready. The towel & beach chair service is excellent if you want to go over to the beach rather than hanging by the pool.Music every night poolside so good for grabbing a cocktail & relaxing either before heading out for the night or on the way back.Free WiFi, parking,2 bottles of water & phone calls included with the resort fee so I got my value out of it. Also The Link @ Sheraton is great for checking your flights & printing boarding passes or checking your work emails if you really have to.So I can easily recommend Princess Kaiulani for smart travellers who want location, sharp pricing and lots of Aloha when staying in Waikiki.","Sydney,Australia","Coolhand62</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney,Australia</strong>",29,4.0

You are surrounded by all that Waikiki has to offer. Plenty of places within easy walking distance. Seniors that have issues being on their feet for too long will appreciate how centralized this place is. Its not the cheapest place in Waikiki but not near expensive either.-Entertainment by the pool is nice although with so much coming and going of guests and non-guests, it can be a little hard to relax and get into the vibe of it all. But that's ok because you'll be drawn to all the commotion happening just outside and be swept up like salmon in a stream flowing here and flowing there.-This area is pretty much across the street from a police station (next to the Surf Rider) and kept in good shape. Although you still need to be on your guard against pick-pockets and other undesirables (like any big city) this area is fairly clean and safe as opposed to offerings nearer to Kapahulu Avenue (nearer the zoo).-The resort fees aren't so bad and as I said, parking is VERY easy here which is a huge plus.-My one gripe is that the AC is connected to other rooms...Meaning if you have some jerk ignoring the rules and smoking in their room, your room with wreak of cigarettes. A simple call to security however will remedy it real quick. Please, be considerate of others, you don't know if your neighbor has breathing problems, take it down stairs...After all, I'd offer the same respect to you!-Remember, don't let Waikiki consume your trip.

Stayed in the Hilton and LOVED the rooms...but the Sheraton is suited better for those guests wanting a place to socialize. I was in Honolulu for business, so rather have a quiet and clean room. Room was clean. Bathroom very outdated. Grout on bathroom floor needed to be scrubbed...actually looked very grosh around the toilet area. I could hear the guest in the next room talking at 3am...irritating to have an adjoining that the hotel does not place some sort of barrier in between the doors to prevent this. Bed was comfortable. Nice linens. Those in my group enjoyed the pool and party atmosphere of the common areas.

I was pleasantly surprised by the overhaul of the lobby/common areas, which are much improved and definitely emblematic of the ""new"" Sheraton brand. SPG Platinum recognition was great-- upgrade to the Jasmine Suite with amazing ocean views, 4pm late check out honored despite it being a resort, snack amenity, discount at F&B outlets, etc. The resort fee included internet , a souvenir photo (Which we unfortunately didn't take them up on), and beach service-- chairs + water /fruit service on Waikiki. Splash , the pool bar had fantastic cocktails (the Mai Tai and Tropical Itch were our favorites) and the food was really good too (the garlic fries!!!). The check-in speed was a little slow, but thorough and helpful. This is the best SPG paid rate or points value on Waikiki, particularly if you are going to spend most of your time outside the room (which was a tiny bit dated, but spacious and with a beautiful balcony facing the ocean).","New York City, New York","zephyr221</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",42,4.0

We spent 17 Glorious days at the Sheraton Princess Kauilani and we took full advantage of the beautiful Island if Oahu. This being our first trip back in 8 yrs after an accident this trip was monumental for myself. The Island captured the hearts of both myself and my Daughter all over again as if it was our first visit. First let me recommend this Hotel for the kindness and sincerity of the staff, the amazing Ocean View, Clean, Comfortable beautiful rooms, the amazing Lanai that you can sit on morning or night after all your adventures just listening to the Ocean waves, in the evening you can listen to local music being played often by someone on a Saxophone. I never found this individual but the music was nearly nightly and it soothed the soul.Next the Ocean is across the street, you are so close yet you are not trampled by the tourists all running toward the beach. You can walk at your leisure to the beach. There are Hotels with drinks and Appetizers otherwise known as Hawaiian Pupu's right there and right at the edge of Waikiki behind the police Station that looks like a tourist center there is a small window beach cafe with the most amazing lunch items and snacks. Right along the main strip there is a small ice cream shop with the Famous Dole Pineapple Sorbet. The Waikiki Beach is second to none, beautiful and inviting, warm and wonderful.However that's not near all there is to do. We three times took our Rental Car and went around the coast roads taking pictures and absorbing all the beauty of each and every scenic outlook. I wouldn't miss one of them. Although classified as illegal my daughter did the Dead Mans Cat Walk hike with two warm local kids her age. This was well worth the effort the scenery is spectacular. We visited the ONLY Palace on US Soil, originally within the Hawaiian Monarchy, The Iolani Palace, as well as Queen Emmas Summer Palace. We located the Royal Burial Grounds and paid our respects to the former Kings, Queens, Princesses and Princes. Their History is not to be missed within a visit to Oahu. We of course went to Pearl Harbor, not once but twice because one day the boats weren't allowed to go to the Memorial. A trip to Hawaii isn't complete without paying your respects to the men that gave up their lives there so we may continue to visit this beautiful paradise. Moving toward the other shores on this beautiful Island we went to Kailua and Lanikai Beaches. These are more local beaches yet they are filled with beauty less tourists and they were simply amazing. We doing Teddy's Bigger Burgers in Kailua, and the Hawaiian hamburger, with fresh grilled pineapple this was delectable, with Sweet Potato fries and the Chocolate Peanut butter hand dipped Milk shake. After a long day of swimming it hit the spot. The next day we visited the Pali Look out, then the Valley of Temples, another must in my opinion. We were lucky to see the Waterfall in the distance across from the exit of the Pali Look out flowing quite magnificently even though it is far away and it was in the DRY season. The Valley of Temples was absolutely beautiful. There is a Buddhist Temple there along with Many other religious Shrines to many Faiths. This was a peaceful and amazing place to visit and I wouldn't have missed it for the world.The next day we set off on our adventure to explore the North Shore. We visited the Dole Plantation, then a quick first trip to the Historic town of Haliewa. Dole was wonderful yet busy. The pineapple fresh and the Sorbet were amazing. I've often told people until you have tasted Fresh pineapple in Hawaii you haven't tasted Pineapple really. Due to the fact that after being harvested if it is to leave the Islands it is injected with many preservatives, which dramatically change the taste of the Pineapple. After a wonderful visit to Dole and the gift shop where we bought lip balm in tropical flavors you can't find on the mainland we headed toward Haliewa. We quickly observed all the changes in the years we were absent, then made our way to the Coast Road. To visit Sharks Cove Tide Pools, and Turtle Bay. We stopped and took many pictures of Sharks Cove Tide Pools but this trip we didn't make it to swim in them because my back was still hurting. Next we went to Turtle Bay, to say I was blown away would be putting it mildly. We observed 20-30 Turtles coming in and out of the water eating the Algae on the Lava boulders in the water. You are so close to these Sea Turtles, but must remember never to touch them so that you never change their Natural Habitat. After all the Sea Turtle is the ONLY living Prehistoric thing we have left. In Hawaii they call the Sea Turtle the Honu. It's worth your time to look up the Honu and investigate the meaning behind it and how it applies to you. I guarantee you will be captivated with these beautiful creatures as I was... We spent a couple of hours just watching them and taking pictures we were so excited. Loving this so much we came back the next two full days after breakfast to swim with these beautiful Sea Turtles. At this point I must digress, for breakfast everyday we went to the most amazing, affordable restaurant for breakfast. Keoni's right on Kuhio Ave. The food was all fantastic but I fell in love with the Banana Pancakes with Coconut Syrup or the Macadamia Nut Pancakes with the coconut syrup. They also came Banana/Macadamia Nut that were great. On the third day to the North Shore my daughter did the most amazing adventure ever. she went on a free dive with Sharks with no cages. This was a private charter with no more than 6 people. They went to a secluded spot where the water was 650 feet deep, the boat Captain and Shark expert got in the water to make sure of the Sharks temperament .. And then for two full hours they free swam with Galapagos Sharks. They also saw 2 Baracuda that were very afraid of humans and swam away quickly. My daughter used her GoPro camera and filmed this adventure of swimming with the Sharks, a memory she will cherish for a lifetime. ( this was especially wonderful for her because she's starting College to be a Marine Biologist with Shark Studies as a Primary Interest for her.) again after a very long hot day we found. Teddy's Bigger Burgers and we're thrilled. The other day we found a host of Shrimp Trucks that make fresh Shrimp in many different ways and you sit at picnic benches enjoying the tropical environment while you eat outdoors. We enjoyed shopping at the stores especially the Red Dirt Shirt Store on the North Shore, as these shirts can't be found anywhere else in the world, they now have a whole new variety called Lava Rock Shirts that are amazing too. We found the Haiku Stairs, deemed the Stairway to Heaven another illegal hike but we decided to save this until our next visit. Everyday after our adventures we swam in the beautiful waters of Waikiki Beach and sometimes even our swimming pool at the beautiful Sheraton Princess Kauilani that has converted their pool to a salt water pool at some point. Amazing in and of itself. Reconnecting with Hawaii in this amazing 17 day trip and spending it at the Sheraton Princess Kauilani was incredible. I feel like I'm surely leaving things out here like the adventure we had in going to find the shop to purchase the Go Pro the several times I missed my exit and we laughed till we cried. Of course the day we spent at the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet where souvenir vendors are there to sell any thing and everything your looking for, there are over 400 of them. The night we drove to Ko Olina to have dinner but the restaurant was too busy so we took take out and sat at the Marriotts Ko Olina Beach Club Resort and ate a picnic on the beach watching the Sunset. The Afternoon Tradewinds Sail that leaves from the Sheraton Waikiki Beach, (coupon on Groupon), the sail was FANTASTIC!!!Like I said I know I'm forgetting things because our 17 days were packed and sitting here now, I've got tears in my eyes wishing I was back for another 2 weeks right now. For anyone looking to go to Hawaii it's NEVER out of your reach, it's never some where you can only dream about there are ALWAYS ways to make this happen. If you need tips contact me, this was my 8th trip and I plan on making #9 at Xmas. To get me for help thethirdeye08@gmailHawaii is amazing and somewhere everyone should aspire to expierence, the feeling you have after being there is incomparable. ",,Julianna S,60,5.0

Although the hotel is in need of an update and the decor is a little old and tired, it is clean, very comfortable and its proximity to local beaches, shopping and attractions is perfect, basically right in the middle of the Waikiki strip and just across the road from the famous Waikiki beach. The staff are absolutely wonderful, friendly, accommodating and will do all they can to help, even better to,see is they employ a good percentage of mature age people here and this is excellent in this day and age, it's always lovely to have a young staff but there is another whole world of older workers out there with far more experience and superior service skills so,the mix is good to see at this hotel.... The pool is small but well maintained with a great area to relax and the music every night is top notch..... The tours desk and concierge were informative and very helpful.... The only slight negative is the buffet breakfast which is below average in my opinion, the selection is poor, quality is not great and the variety (little as there is) never changes.

I feel like most Waikiki hotels are dated and not nearly worth what you're paying, especially compared to other resort towns. I tend to avoid staying in Waikiki for exactly that reason, but here's what worked and didn't work for us at the PK:+ Cost. Just over $100 a night, we were 'upgraded' to a partial ocean-view that just happened to be adjacent to construction of the new International Marketplace. I honestly didn't mind the noise, it felt far off and I'm okay with the sounds of the city when staying in a city, but I'm sure that's a dealbreaker for many. + Location. Super central, we were able to walk anywhere around Waikiki without it feeling like much of an effort. + Resort fee. While resort fees are complete bull, this one at least got us both wi-fi AND parking, which in a $30-40/night parking city is not too bad. We had no problem getting in and out and about. + Common areas/staff. The lobby and pool area were very nice, and actually tricked us into thinking we were really getting a crazy good deal when we first arrived. I liked the open pool, bar, and ability to walk in and out of the property so easily, and the person who checked us in was very friendly and helpful. - Room. Dated as mentioned, just nothing special, not really a huge minus if you're not spending much time in your room but worth mentioning that the rooms feel less Sheraton than Holiday Inn. We went in not expecting any view at all, so we feel like we came out ahead in the end, and one nice thing about the 'city view' of International Marketplace is that it's very expansive, like you're not right up against another hotel. I would likely return for another value deal at a value resort like this one, and throw the extra dough into food/experiences.","Los Angeles, California","John M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",36,4.0

Greeted by Christina at the front desk who was very friendly, courteous, and efficient and we were quickly up to our room.

Although the beds were doubles (we knew that going in) there still seem to be enough sleeping area. The room also included a small coffee maker, safe and refrigerator that we made use of.While not on the beach itself, it was a 5 minute walk to Kuhio beach. The zoo and Kapiolani park are about .5 mile away AC in the room seemed like it couldn't keep up during the days (mid July 2015) but it was rather humid during our stay. Also, I'm not sure if the sliding door to the balcony was supposed to be so hard to open. I suspect it wasn't as the lock to latch the door didn't work. I would've moved rooms as we have a 3 yr old but the door couldn't be opened (or moved) by him.The lobby seems like it was renovated and the room decor was fine, but the rest of the hotel does need a facelift. Especially the pool, which seems like it was designed as a diving pool and not a hotel pool since the ""kids"" zone of <5' is about a quarter of the pool (who needs a 7' deep pool at a hotel?)

I wish I had checked Tripadvisor before I booked my stay here. It is very easy to understand that this hotel is number 60 out of 82 hotels in Honolulu.Even as a SPG Platinum I felt that I was staying in a dingy and tired roadside motel. You are forced to pay a resort fee at about 30 USD per night. What in the world makes this hotel a resort? There is no beach, and the pool is small and filled with kids, no place for relaxing. The pool area is very small considering the number of rooms.- nearly 1200 rooms. Check in was slow, once we got to our room we were shocked. How can this hotel bear the Sheraton name? It does not appear that this hotel has been renovated since the 70s - when they built the tower. The view was great! That's the only positive I can say about the room. Housekeeping was spotty as well - they did not restock the toiletries fully on any morning. There was always something missing - shampoo, soap, etc. The wifi signal in my room was very spotty. I read somewhere that the whole hotel was due for demolition, I can understand why.I could hear snoaring and the tv from the room next door, poor isolation. The furnishings were 1970s, and the bed was absolutely not even close to the Sheraton Sweet Sleeper bed. No sockets close to the bed - just like any other old hotel. Slow elevators that took forever. The breakfast was okey - but utterly disgusting. Pigeons were feasting from the buffet every time they got the chance. The staff members tried to keep the pigeons away, but as soon as they got busy with other things the pigeons were back. In my country this would be considered a health hazard.The dinner buffet were nice as well, even though the food were supposed to have a different theme each nice we found most of the food to be the same on the two nights we visited. We also found out that two breakfast coupons could be exchanged to one dinner buffet. The dinner buffet was almost 50 dollars, PLUS tip and drinks.However, on our first night we went downstairs at 9:30 PM to get some food. We were informed that the kitchen were closed, and there were absolutely no food to be had. The bar was open, but they weren't serving food. I find that very strange....1200 rooms and absolutely no food to be had after 9PM??? As we were very tired after travelling for 24 hours we just settled for a Subway right outside the hotel entrance.The platinum/gold desk were never staffed. Having 1200 rooms, and two persons working at the front desk meant that there were long ques. Once I had to wait 20 minutes to change my room key (that wasn't working). BTW - I could hear people complaining about the hotel several times when I passed the front desk.I will give one star for the nice room view, and one star for the nice restaurant/bell boy/beach service staff. The restaurant staff were really accomodating. So was the bell boy staff - they also kept parcels for me without any hassle. The hotel don't have any beach stand - but you can borrow chairs and towels by the pool and take to the beach. They will also give you a bottle of water and an apple - but only on certain times. Found these guys to be very accomodating. The other staff we encountered, at the front desk and housekeeping, were indifferent.For the rest of the hotel - zero stars. Location was good.Verditc: I wont stay here again in a million years! Take your money and go elsewhere :)","Oslo, Norway","skrosvik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oslo, Norway</strong>",203,2.0

We didnt mind the fee but please outline it when booking . Also our room while being very comfortable and clean was obviously one of their ""bottom of the range"" being that our view was a wall until you walked to the balcony then it overlooked the pool plus the air cond was very loud from the neighboring tower of the hotel when sitting on the balcony which we didnt do much because of this AND it never had any sun.

It was a good view but if you don't go down by the pool and listen to the singers you'll still hear them really well. The wall paper in my room was peeling off. Towrds the end of my stay I noticed water dripping from the AC vent. I could hear the people in the room next to me like they were in my room. I knew when they opend and closed the closet. I could easily hear their conversations. When I took a shower I noticed the soap dish was not clean and the grout in the floor was dark grey in some places. I asked the maid to clean the rest room really well. She cleaned the tub better but not the floor. The next time I saw her I asked her if she could get the floor scrubbed. She explained that she might but it took a machine. They were able to get the machine up to clean the floor but if a gust wants the floor clean get it cleaned. The bar had good drinks and a good staff. The food was pretty good. The pool closed at 7pm which seemed since the sun was still up. There was a stand to get your towels from at the pool but they had two people there and required you to electronically check the towels (whiç˙ were nothing special) in and out with your room key. The pool staff was not perticularly frindly or welcoming. Guest are allowed to use the pool at sister properties if you want to walk over. I have stayed at worse hotels but I have also stayed at better. I am really suprised Sheraton doesn't either fix this property or at least rename it so it does not hurt their reputation.To end on a posative the bed was comfortable (but there was a dark stain oin the sheet that I noticed near me feet on the first morning.)

There doesn't appear to be any amount insulation between them and you can hear everything going on in the rooms around you. I don't mind a bit of noise until say 11pm or even midnight but as I write this review its 1am and i don't think i'll be getting too much sleep tonight. It took 2 visits from hotel security to quiet them down with the second visit being 2am. There is a lot of construction going on around the hotel and a few of the bigger hotels on Kuhio Ave (behind the hotel) have closed for renovation so rooms are short in this part of Waikiki it seems. The hotel staff I encountered on this trip were very friendly and always there to help.,"Melbourne, Australia","OzFlyer01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",6,3.0

Close to beach, shops and restaurants. Nice rooms and nice pool areas. We arrived very early in the morning on an international flight. Upon asking at check in if we could be given a room earlier than 3pm as we had a tour booked at 3pm and needed to change, we were advised that we were on an express check in list. After spending the whole day waiting around and checking on the progress of our room where we kept getting told there was no room available, we finally got a room at 10 minutes to 3pm. So it took them 7 hours to get a room ready for us that day, but every morning after that we had housekeeping barging in on to service our room at 8am.We had paid extra to get the partial ocean view room. There is a huge construction project right next door and our room was overlooking it. Each morning we were woken to the sounds of explosions and banging coming from next door at around 6 am. Which I guess on the bright side was good because at least we were awake in time for housekeeping.These issues and little things like the restaurant always running out of things made our stay less than comfortable. In hindsight, I wish I'd paid a little bit extra and stayed at the Moana Surfrider across the road.","Canberra, Australia","anne1313</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",83,2.0

We booked a king standard room with city view, but we were given a complimentary upgrade for a partial ocean view room with double beds. Our room was on the 16th floor, the hallway was a little dim and had a musty old smell. When we got to our room it was clean, but when we stepped out to the balcony our view was of construction that was going on, which the check in staff did not mention. The construction would start at 7:30 am and end at 5:30 pm it was very noisy, we were never able to have the glass door open to let breeze come in. The only partial ocean view we saw was when we stuck out our heads over the balcony to see the ocean, good thing we didnt have to pay for that partial ocean view because that would be a rip off. We tried changing our room, but they kept telling us that nothing was available. The lobby to the tower elevator would always smell like fried fish because the buffet was right next to it, which was not pleasant to smell as soon as I came down stairs, they need to put air fresheners around the lobby. Our lock to our baggage was also tampered with. We left in morning to North Shore and locked one of our bags and when we came back to the room it seemed like someone had tried to open the lock because the key hole was pushed in and jammed and we couldn't get the lock to open, so my husband called the front desk and security came to our room and told us that he didn't think anyone was trying to get into our bag as ""if someone was then they would have"" and just brushed it off as if nothing happened. He fiddled with the lock for a bit and opened it, luckily everything was in our bag, so be careful with your valuables.

I mentioned to the front desk at the Ohana East that the Sheraton had sent us here because of an overbooking & he said they had overbooked FOURTY rooms !! We booked our stay on Kayak, I suggest booking directly thru the hotel if you really want to stay here. Better yet, stay somewhere else.","Lanai City, Hawaii","eatmystardust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lanai City, Hawaii</strong>",5,1.0

Great beds. Next to international market (perk in the future) and central location to most of the beach area.Recommend fully and would definitely return.------I've stayed at many hotels and typically book my room solely off of star ratings. It seems like this rating system may be upside down as this hotel greatly outshone those with higher star rating.I grew up in Japan and Hawaii, but it had been years since I had been back to either. I immediately noticed at both that the people didn't seem as friendly as I remembered when I was growing up. I remembered people smiling a lot, having respect, taking care of elders, and just being ""good people.""I could still find a higher percentage of these people the further I got from Tokyo and Honolulu, but it was a genuine disappointment on the whole touring both.------The staff we encountered at Sheraton Princess had great customer service and didn't seem fake: they weren't only smiling for the tourists. I think when you can see them smiling and laughing when each other it's a great sign of where the true aloha spirit is coming from.I also stayed at the Marriott and Hilton; incredibly disappointed by a handful of staff members and the rooms themselves.As someone returning, the Princess was ""no ka oi"" for me","Thomasville, Georgia","Martin102608</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Thomasville, Georgia</strong>",24,5.0

We were a little concerned over some of the reviews as to the age of the place, that it was old and tired, etc., but to be across the street from the beach smack dab in the middle of Waikiki, we figured we'd give it a shot. We were only going to be there one night (off to the cruise ship the next day), so I splurged to give my husband an ocean view for our first night in Hawaii! And it was!!! We live in SE Florida and see beautiful oceans and reefs and sand and palm trees all the time, but we opened the door to the room and said OMG in unison!!! We were positively delighted!!! And we thank Justin, at the front desk, for his sensitivity to our wanting to make this a very special celebration! I can't say enough about Justin! He was everything you want someone on the front desk to be! Understanding, professional, diplomatic, caring, and really really nice, too!!! We were simply thrilled with our view!!! The lobby is gorgeous at this place, and the location is fabulous (for the price), it's exactly across the street from the big fancy hotel on the beach! And right in the middle of everything you could want!! Walk anywhere! We did a little walking, but ended up at the beach for sunset and a fancy drink. Our room was not the most updated we've ever been in, due to the age of the building, it's small compared to the new hotels. But the bed was terrific, and we're annoying oldsters who want comfy beds 'cause sleep can be elusive. I absolutely loved the bed! Average bathroom, good water pressure, clean, clean, clean. We were only staying one night, but they treated us like we were staying three weeks! We enjoyed a super breakfast the next morning (not included) but we thought it was a deal at $24.50.....bottomless buffet of good food, which we enjoyed on the patio. There's a problem with birds in these outdoor spots in Hawaii, and we got the biggest kick out of the employee whose job it is to shoo away the birds with a stick with flowing fabric on it. I'm not keen on sharing my space with birds, but we're eating outside and it's Hawaii. No biggie. We got ourselves into the vacation feel with a photo (we got a coupon from Justin) and we did the picture thing and we're glad we did because the photo on the ship was awful, and they only took one.....these guys - Gerard & Zachary at the Photo Booth, really seemed to care that we liked our pictures. He took us all around the property to various trees and backgrounds and we got ourselves our favorite picture from the trip. And he squeezed us in on his lunch break 'cause we didn't have an appointment. Across the board the folks at the Sheridan were so nice, the place is beautiful, the room although older (very 70's) was spotless and very comfortable and who cares, the view was awesome!!! The bedding was all new, plush white on white. The very best pillows anywhere!!! We were in the tower on a high floor in a corner room looking toward Diamond Head. Wow just doesn't cover it for our view!!! All these hotels have an added on fee for parking, etc., about $25, and we had to pay that, but even with that tacked on, it's still the best deal in town! It was a glorious start to our two weeks in Hawaii. You can stay on the beach for $450 a night, but this was in the $225 range, called a partial ocean view and I can't imagine anything nicer!!! I actually liked it better looking up the beach than to look directly at the beach! If you're super fussy for the to-die-for bedroom, this isn't for you, but if you want clean, good service, gorgeous view, comfortable bed, beautiful lobby, a restaurant, and a good price, we found a winner!","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","EileenHerself</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>",2,4.0

The location is great, right in the middle of Waikiki and across the street from the beach.The lobby is open and comfortable. On the first floor, there's a large area for computer access, a sitting area to read, the pool (no hot tub), a small stage for performances, and a bar/restaurant. I didn't eat at the restaurant, but the buffet breakfast smelled wonderful! There are 2 buildings and I'm sure some had a view of the ocean. Mine did not but that was okay since I wasn't in my room very much. The room included all the standard amenities including a small fridge and 2 free bottles of water. The beds were clean but the room itself and the carpet were a bit dated. The staff was friendly and knowledgable. You need to pay the irritating $25.00 resort fee per day. It includes free parking (I didn't have a car), internet (well, internet should be free), free buffet for kids with paying adult (I had not kids) and a free photo that they choose. So, you need to book your free photo shoot 24 hours in advance. The only time they had for me was at 2:30, which wasn't convenient. But the idea is that you walk around the property with a photographer taking multiple photos for 15-30 minutes. Then, they pick which photo they will give you for free and you can buy the others. The pool is open from 8am - 7pm. If you head to the beach, they hand out fruit and water to guests 3x a day by the statue near the beach, which is a nice added benefit. They also offered lei making and other activities around the hotel during the day. There was a work out room on the 2nd floor that had a good number of cardio and weight machines. The only thing is that I asked for a late checkout for 11:30 and they deactivated my key at 11am. I had to go down to the front desk and they happily reset my key card. Otherwise, it was a very pleasant experience.","san francisco, ca","OandO</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>san francisco, ca</strong>",41,4.0

It can be quite a noisey hotel - both visits we were often woken early in the morning by delivery trucks and traffic. On this latest visit, there was major construction going on in the site next to the hotel with workmen starting as early as 5am and creating a lot of noise. Not the fault of the hotel, but just a nuisance. Check-in or any enquiry at the front desk can take a while. There are usually only a few staff working at any one time and they seem to spend a long time with each guest. We were very surprised and upset that we came back to our room one day and found the maid charging her phone on our charger. She looked embarrassed and left quickly.

The lobby, courtyard and pool are very nice and were not crowded. They offered free music and hula shows every night poolside, which our toddler absolutely loved. However, the rooms are very, very outdated and worn out. We booked an ocean-view room and upon entering were extremely disappointed. We did not expect what we'd find at a luxury hotel, but it was well below the standard we've grown accustomed to at a Sheraton, or even more budget hotels. Though the room was very clean, the first thing we noticed was the musty smell. The room had almost no amenities, the furnishings were very old, chipped and scratched and there was no décor to speak of, aside from one faded painting. The wallpaper was separating at the seams. The bathroom was minute and unwelcoming. It was also next to the noisy service elevator. The ocean view of Waikiki was excellent, but could only be seen by going out on the small balcony. We decided to visit the front desk and see if we could purchase an upgraded room. The gentleman at the desk was very kind and helpful. He offered us a deluxe ocean view room at no extra cost and we took him up on the offer. The room was slightly larger, no funny smell, and in somewhat better condition.

This hotel was actually the cheapest hotel by far given we had a car and needed parking. I must say my rating is given considering the normal prices they charge, not really the last minute distressed inventory price we paid (which was exceptional for such a centrally located hotel, even if we didn't need to park). The first impression is - well, the hotel is VERY old, the mail chutes on each floor attests to its origins in the 1950s. Consequently the rooms are rather small by modern standards, even if they were updated some time in the previous decade or so - so is reasonably modern inside. It also seemed reasonably quiet, but then again maybe it's only because the hotel wasn't anywhere near full. My only complaint is that the air conditioning was either off or waaaaaaaaaaaaay too cold (the system is so old you can only control fan speed). Luckily the temperature was comfortable enough that we didn't need the air conditioning at all. Surprisingly the WiFi works wonderfully well, better than many much newer build hotels. We had a ""partial ocean view room"" so our balcony had the view over the pool, an outlook to the front of the magnificent Moana hotel and a bit of blue ocean beyond. Quite nice to just sit around and watch life pass by in the pool and the street below.It's a wonderfully located hotel, cross the road and you're on Waikiki Beach (which really is nothing special, especially given all the beautiful beaches we'd seen on Maui and Big Island in the week prior). Everything in Waikiki is within very short walking distance, which is just as well because the buffet looks very ordinary. I especially loved having Haagen Daas in the same complex, and Cheesecake Factory being a very short walk away ... The pool area is rather tranquil given the location, I enjoyed that it was a deep pool you could swim in, but never understood why it closes so early. It's the kind of pool you'd want to have a drink or two and a swim after dinner. There's apparently also a beach chair service on Waikiki but only during the middle of the day.Parking fee is included in the resort fee, which is great because other hotels can charge a lot more on top. The parking lot is a bit curious, only the top floor has elevator access, but it doesn't matter because the lot itself is so close and handy.I'll most definitely stay here again if the price is right, but certainly is not what you'd expect from a Sheraton (think Holiday Inn), especially not at its normal prices.","Sydney, Australia","Kitkat271</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",56,3.0

Some things are fabulous, like the location, customer service, check-in, bell station, valet, breakfast areas and speedy elevators. It's these fabulous and wonderful features that tend to eclipse the most horrible feature: the rooms! This is why you'll see such a large range of ratings on here - If you don't care that the rooms are straight out of the 1950's, both in layout and furniture, there is so much else to love that you might be tempted to give this hotel 4 or 5 pts. However, the bedrooms and hallways were dirty, filthy, old and archaic. The bathrooms were old and dingy and tiny. They need more than a renovation they need to be remodeled. I called the front desk upon seeing my full ocean-front room, which I paid $40/night extra for - and just broke down and cried because it reminded me of an old, cheap hotel from the 1960's in Niagara Falls. Of course in the 1960's all the hotels were cheap-o. I mean old and dirty and ick! - right now, here at this Sheraton! Why they have not renovated the rooms is shocking. However, when I called the front desk they sent Elizabeth Rapp up to help me and she quickly whisked me to another floor and made sure everything was as neat and clean as it could be. Once I got used to the idea of having a less-than-nice room, even though the beds were fabulous and there was no noise, everything else panned out. So it's difficult to rate. Sheraton, how could you allow an amazingly-located hotel with your name on it to get run down like this? It's super nice that the open-air lobby and breakfast area has been renovated, now maybe the rooms? Their pool was a salt-water pool and not heated, but it was warm enough and the salt-water felt good. The buffet breakfast is served until 11:00 and has everything you could want. The elevators are super fast and there's a place to fill your water bottles with fresh water from the well off site. There's a place to get your pictures taken around the hotel and on the beach, as well as all open-air lobby which was just delightful. Every morning there were local artists selling their wares also in the lobby. The view from the room was stunning and the beds were as always, comfortable. There wasn't much noise and my room was very quiet. All staff in every department went always, always, always above and beyond to keep the hotel looking as best as it could and always offering to get you anything you'll want. My room was #1750 and I highly recommend it as being one of the nicer, cleaner rooms. If you want to cry when you get in there because it's old, old, old...just remember that 1750 is one of the nicer rooms and floors and even it looks old. But the chairs were comfortable and useable and I was grateful for that. My first room, 2350 ?? even the hallway was dark and dirty. The 17th floor is much better than the higher floors which need new carpet, new wallpaper - steaming the old off as it's already got about 8 layers on it. If your windows/doors shake with the wind, do not accept this because they have someone who can come up and fix it right away. If they would wipe down the safes that might help. There is just dirt and gritty, shabby old lampshades and not even a footstool or chaise lounge. There is so much great about this hotel if they'd just redo the rooms it'd be an easy 5. Unfortunately that isn't scheduled until 2017!! I guess that is the critical mass point at which the ugliness of the rooms supercedes the beauty of the rest of it. I would stay here again and ask for room 1750. That's the only way. The staff was stellar. They can only do so much with what they've got to work with and if you can close your eyes to the room, the bed is comfortable and the view of the ocean outstanding. The air conditioner works quite well, you get fresh water daily, the internet worked well. Lots to love. :-) Just don't go here to get pampered. This is not a spa hotel. At all. It was a nice memory but the rooms, they're bad. It was only the customer service team that helped me move all my things to another room and floor that saved the day. If you don't care about your room so much this hotel will be fine, however, if you need a nice room consider another hotel. The rooms are just not there. I feel like I have to write this because we expect more from Sheraton. Especially in Hawaii. :-(","Englewood, Colorado","lindawJ811LW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Englewood, Colorado</strong>",52,2.0

The hotel is situated on the cornet of Kalakaua Ave and Kanekapolei Street right in the hearty of Waikiki. It is across the road from the Mona Surfrider and no more than a two minute walk from the beach.On arrival my status was noted and I was advised that I had been upgraded to a pool view. The staff were very polite friendly and professional and indeed this was my experience of all the staff I encountered over the two days. I was given breakfast vouchers and briefed on how the $26 a night resort fee worked. (I hate this fee) and is should be abolished by all hotels immediately.The hotel lobby was clean and functional but not particularly interesting.My room, on the second floor was clean, but there was not much else going for it. There would have been a pool view if the triffid like tree had been removed. However the most notable issue was the lack of power outlets and the use of a very large multi adapter on the floor. charging iPods cameras and iPads was challenging and this is not a hotel you would use if in Waikiki for work.the car park is self park and to the rear of the hotel. If you go directly to to the top floor there is direct access to the hotels 3rd floor.There is a self service laundry which was very handy.Breakfast was particularly underwhelming and it was just as well it was free!my schedule did not allow the use of the pool until just before I left when I discovered it was closed due to ""organic contamination!"" I didn't blame the hotel for this but they could have made alternative arrangements but chose not to. I did feel aggrieved at paying $53 fir parking and other than than night the resort fee provided this guest with little else.A late check out was allowed although only after some discussion and finally me pointing out that 4pm was standard. The hotel countered with ""when available"" but I was grateful for them sorting things out in the end.The staff were great but the hotel needs a lot of work. For a very short stay in the heart of Waikiki this is probably ideal for 1 or 2 nights but no more.

When I asked them type of activities that we may be able to do on the island. No one seems like could provide good suggestion. But they answer some of my specific questions. We did not use the hotel restaurant since they are pricy. The hotel is just few minutes away from the Waikiki Beach. It is very very close. There is ABC Store by the hotel and we we went to buy many supplies. However, last day, we learned there was a Safeway grocery store about 5 minutes drive (it may be much cheaper). The bed is comfortable. We spent as much time as we could outside. So by the time we got back to the room, we were very tired. We just slept. The only complaint I have is the construction next to the hotel. If you close the door, it was quiet. However, in the morning 5AM, construction started, you can hear truck beeping sound all the time which is very annoy. We did use the pool once which has very nice setting. My daughter and wife did attend a free art class and they enjoyed it. Overall, the hotel is showing its age but it is still nice. Most of staffs were very friendly. I will stayed here again.","Chicago, Illinois, United States","Jerry W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois, United States</strong>",30,4.0

The salad is a good mix of local vegetables and fruits. The chicken would be better grilled than sautéed to help caramelize the marinade. Rating: 4/5Kalua Pork Sandwich is smoky pulled pork served on focaccia bread with homemade BBQ dipping sauce, a trio of melted cheeses, and served with celery, carrot sticks, and ranch dipping sauce. If you like BBQ pork sandwiches, this sandwich is for you. I am more of a purist when it comes to kalua pig and like it plain or with cabbage. The BBQ sauce is overpowering.

Every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, there is a farmer's market with fresh island fruits and local artisanal foods for purchase. Eat some while you're walking or take back to your room for a snack later.* Honolulu Zoo* You can also purchase tickets for the Waikiki Trolley with unlimited boarding privileges with four different routes and over 30 stops.Ainahau Tower has cozy rooms with balconies and all of the creature comforts of a resort hotel: comfortable beds, air conditioning, mini refrigerator, TV, in-room safe, coffee maker, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, ice bucket and drinking glasses, and internet access. The room itself is a little small but the balcony helps open up the space. In the afternoon/evening, live Hawaiian and contemporary music from the pool can be heard in the High Ocean View, Tower Partial Ocean View, Pool View, and Deluxe Ocean View rooms. Relax on the balcony with a drink, let the ocean breeze erase the cares of the day and listen to music, all in the comfort of your own room.Pikake Terrace has a wonderful dinner buffet with flavors that will make everyone in your party happy. Here are some items you might find on the buffet: snow crab legs with drawn butter, grilled steaks, kalua pig and cabbage, Caesar salad, ahi poke, and haupia for dessert.

I was approached by a security and was told that the area is private property and I must leave the premise. I complied and left. The whole time I walked away I got looked at as if I'm going to wait in the area like a criminal. Family ended up looking for me and was told that I was kicked out for using my computer. Upon calling and speaking with the Guest Service Manager I explained my story. Was told a store had complained about me waiting there. The manager ask why didn't I tell the security I am waiting for family. My question is why didn't they ask instead of kicking me out. It's not my job to ask questions. If a hostile security kicks you out you do it before a cop comes and get charged with criminal trespass.My family did go to the near by business and apologize for me sitting outside and no one said they called. They informed unless we are sleeping, doing drugs, or becoming a neucence then it should not be an issue with any of the business.

This rate was apparently only for employees but the details of the rate were not disclosed at the time of the booking (and i have read all the info!).

After waiting a very long time to get served at reception we were finally given our rooms. The lobby, while decent looking, was packed with people. The elevator took forever and we had to wait 10 ninutes to go up to our room. This is where things took a turn for the worse. Despite us requesting multiple times and being assured (at the front desk just minutes before) our rooms were not interconnecting. This is a problem because we have 2 rooms and having them separate is a huge hassle. When we rang reception they were extremely unhelpful and suggested instead we get given free shampoo as a compensation. I thought this was a very rude comment because we had mentioned one of the problems with not having interconnecting rooms is sharing toileteries like shampoo. They made no effort to help us or arrange a room swap. Another room in our party is also on a completely separate floor, to which the responded ""but they are still in the same building"". I find this to be extremely rude, we book as a party and we are not even on the same floor? What a joke. The rooms are old, dirty, the balcony doors dont lock, we cannot access our wardrobe due to a desk, the safes look decades old and the rooms are TINY. We can barely open our suitcases anywhere. The balcony railings look ready to rust and break off if you touch them. Our ""ocean view"" consists of you leaning our the railing and looking far out to the right. The pool is tiny and has barely enough chairs for everyone and it closes at 6pm for some unknown reason. We waited for ages at the bar and were ignored and then had to wait at our table for ages for the waitress. Overall it is a huge disappointment.

Young, good looking, and Extremely nice and helpful!!! A+++ for Justin. And I knew a lot about the area- but I wanted to double check my plans w the conceigere....and WOW- was Terry a bottle of positivity or what!!!! So so so nice and helpful!!! A++++, she gave us additional plans that were spot on!!!! Hotel fee: read the reviews. Stop complaining people!! Every hotel charges them. And guess what- I drove around the block for 30mins attempting to avoid the garage fee of $25- only to find out the parking for your stay is INCLUDED in your hotel fee. HAHAH- what a deal!!! Hotel fee also included a free 4x6 pic, drink voucher, Wi- FI, and a few other things. Rooms: I have read so many reviews before coming here that I just could not believe some people on here. First off, we must have spent 7 hours each day in our rooms- to only sleep. I have stayed in 100's of hotel rooms for work and OKAY this isn't my favorite room, but it still had EXACTLY what we needed. And the balcony made the room a complete success. A+ room. To do: Eat: Duke's. Great atmosphere on the water. Good crowd. Enter through a hotel. ABSOLUTE BEST food your money- RAINBOWS!! Get the loco moto. We went there a second time for lunch and I ordered the mixed plate. $7.75 and $8.00 respectively. Opposed to my 2 tacos at Dukes for $18.75. - Pearl Harbor is a must! Opens at 7am. Get there earlier and grab your tickets before the allotted tickets for the assigned time slot run out. - Hike Diamond Head! Another must. 0.8 hike. It was not that hard- anyone can do it. Wear sneakers!- bc I see so many people wear sandals. Ugh. :). $1/person fee. Or $5/car. And at the bottom get the shaved ice for $3.25. -Go to the North Shore. Along the different beaches We explored Waimea Bay (beach there). We also went over to the Waimea Park and went to the waterfall for a $16 fee. Bring a waterproof disposable camera for the waterfall. - along the drive was THE Dole main station. We stopped for a few minutes. (Overpriced pineapple IMO). - we ate at Jameson's (before Waimea).

We booked an upgraded room with kayak.com, that included breakfast. The room was ok, overlooking the pool, the bed was really comfortable and the linens nice. The halls were dark and musty. The place needs a makeover, but the location is great. The breakfast was one of the best we have ever had!! The omelettes were amazing!! It was your usual buffet breakfast, eggs, fruit, toast, juice etc. The usual price of the buffet was $24.50 a person, which is ridiculous. Who pays $50.00 for breakfast for 2?? Glad we had it included with our upgrade. The front desk staff were very friendly and efficient. The excursions desk was very helpful. We did The North Shore surf bus at their recommendation.

I will address the reviews of the rooms: yes they are slightly dated and yes they could do with a bit of an overhaul but what I will also say is this : you are in Hawaii - why would you want to spend much time in your room other than sleeping/showering? there is so much to do and right on your doorstep from this hotel!! Location wise it was fantastic - literally right in the heart of waikiki, a 2 min walk to the beautiful beaches, shopping galore and food courts a 5 min walk away.Also it is worth noting that for the $26 a day resort fee (quite low by my findings) you get : Free WIFI - cost me $10 a day at the Hilton AND free parking - again $25 a day at the Hilton.Would I stay here again - absolutely!!

We went for a business trip/vacation during the Christmas holidays This is an older property but, location to all the activities of Waikiki are right around the corner. You go to utilize all the activities of your vacation and should only need to sleep and shower at the hotel. The beach is right across the street thru the Moana Surfrider lobby. You can get beach chairs, towels and water in your room with your resort fee and enjoy the beach of Waikiki. Restaurants are all around the area... use the Menus magazine found at the Concierge desk to find reviews. Cheaper breakfast can be found in the area if you don't wish to pay $25 for a buffet. We walked a few blocks and found eggs, bacon and pancakes for $4.95 ea. You can catch the Pink line trolley for $2 ea. and ride all around Waikiki and back for a very cheap sightseeing tour (takes about an hour). As mentioned in other reviews the property is older but, very accommodating. A microwave and small refrigerator in every room and an ABC store on every corner to stock it with soft drinks and beer. If you check out, you can leave your bags with the Bell Stand and have another full day in Hawaii before you catch a late flight home. The hotel even has a hospitality room for use for 1 hour...that is first come first serve to let you freshen up (shower) before you catch your shuttle or taxi back to the airport for the long flights back to the Mainland. Never ate in the hotel but, there were always people in the restaurant at all times of the day and especially at night. Every night there was a show of some sort with music and dancing (if your room overlooks the pool you can here it all from the balcony) and later another show in the bar area. Great local talent! Overall this is not a 5 Star hotel but like I said if you just want a place in the middle of everything and just use it to sleep and shower then the SPK is the place to do this at.

I went down to the lobby and made a complaint about it. They told me that when the maid came to clean my room the next day, that they would make note of the issue and have her take care of it. That is not really an acceptable response because as a cleaner, if I had made that error - my company would call me back immediately to come clean up the hair. I waited til the next day and sure enough after my room had supposedly been cleaned - the same hairs were all in the same locations! I told them again at checkout and all they did was apologize.

My wife and I stayed here previously and this was our second time staying here (20 nights in total). The decor is still extremely old (we were told it had been renovated however this only applied to reception apparently). We paid for a high ocean veiw room, but we were put in a low floor and wasnt till I complained that we moved to a higher level. Unfortunately the sound of rusty balconys being scraped and painted first thing in the morning was something to get used to (the rust is so bad they must be doing this continually, in desperate need of replacing).However the biggest problem was the level of service in the pool and bar area. As I tried to purchased two drinks at the pool area bar for myself and my wife, he said he wouldnt sell them to me unless he can identify who my wife is (who was by the pool putting suncreen on my 2 kids aged 5 and 8). Ive never had this accusation (of buying drinks for minors) thrown at me before and i felt extremely embarrassed in front of other guests.Getting any table service in the pool/bar area is almost impossible. You only have to walk over the road to the Moana Surfrider bar to find out what service is meant to be like. Its not costly to attend tables and take food orders (you might even make a profit doing so) . Everyday the staff stood planted at the bar walking around only every 30 minutes or so.I wont even start on the rude moustached pool towel bloke, ill be here forever.

The A/C was not working properly and was not cooling me or the room. This room was not clean and I would not remove my footwear. I requested another room. This room did not smell but the the room temparature never cooled off. The A/C was totally inadequate. WIFI connection kept dropping out and was totally unsatisfactory. The staff were excellent and I feel very sorry for them to have to go to work every day and pretend that everything is OK when it is clearly not.

When we first booked our reservation, after requesting a king bed thru Bookit, they had us with 2 double beds, Tammy caught that n gave us a room with a king bed in the tower. I would have liked a higher floor, but we got a room on the 5th floor above the pool n we were quite satisfied. After getting settled in, we got on with our trip. We enjoyed the poolside bar. Debbie, our day waitress, was so funny n just spot on keeping us takin care of. She's definitely a keeper! Now, I didnt think this Hotel was that dated, actually I felt it quite modern. Our room was cozy, the bathroom was a bit small, but beyond that, the bed was super comfortable, the view was good, and housekeeping made sure our room was clean everyday, n we had coffee n lots of water! BIG shout out to ur housekeeping team! The Hotel was perfectly located close to restaurants, stores, n best of all, The Beach!! We didnt take advantage of the buffet...but enjoyed an afternoon meal poolside. Btw, very good food! Mo, ur evening bar waiter was perfect!! He remembered exactly what i drank, so when we stopped by he asked if i would like my drink...now thats service! Arthur, ur Bell Captain..was just superb! We wanted to take a tour around the island limo style, n hooked us up with a super guy..for a great deal! Mahalo Arthur! This was a beautiful adventure n vacation, so much Island beauty! I hope we can make another trip back next year! I wish i could remember every employee that helped in some way or another, but All in all, Princess Kaiulani, was a perfect place to stay!! Thank U for ur warm Island hospitality! ","Vancouver, Washington","H684DQkimr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Washington</strong>",4,5.0

We got two per day, rooms always cleaned daily and 2 bottles of water and coffee/tea replaced every day.Second, staff was friendly and helpful, even found my wife's expensive sunglasses and had them waiting on us when we returned from an outing. Third, yes it is dated a bit, but clean, great location, we were on the beach in 5 minutes, only 100 yards from the property. I didn't have that much trouble with noise, it is a big city, expect some.Fourth, the rooms were laid out and signs posted where your room is when you exit the elevator. just take 30 seconds to read them.Fifth, never have had to have a certain paper, i.e. Wall Street Journal or other delivered to me every day. I am on vacation. if you want one, there is an ABC store 50 feet in either direction.Sixth, you want a robe, take one with you...lol Really? $225 a night in that location? We did get a free drink at the bar, guess I should complain because it wasn't of my choosing, but hey, I'm easy to please. This is Hawaii, everything costs more. Our friends paid $280 a night, plus $36 resort fee, no free breakfast. (valued at $24 by them, but even at $13 each was worth the room fee). if you get a chance, want a nice hotel, stay there.

The tissue paper box was empty and never replaced, no bottles of water as part of the resort fee (two bottles per day). Called about it, waited an hour and still no tissue box or bottles of water.

After one night there we went to the front desk to request a better room as that room seemed more Motel 6 quality than Sheraton quality. To their credit, after a discussion where I emphasised the room was not of the standard we expected, they did move us to a room in the newer higher tower. We were on the 27th floor facing north east.The room was definitely nicer and the patio was larger and the view was very nice. Even though the second room was better than the first, we still don't feel it was up to Sheraton standards.The housekeeping and maintenance staff were very pleasant and helpful. We did have an issue with the lock on the new room. Security came quickly to confirm that we were the right people trying to get into the room and to determine the problem.

The bar is overpriced and they have the ads around the hotel about happy hours that includes some cocktails but on the bar they only offer beer and wine, 2 cocktails would cost at least $20 elsewhere there is always cocktails offered in happy hour period.

It mystified us why Sheraton keeps this particular hotel in its portfolio here.It is absolutely true however to remember that while this hotel lacks the spark and Aloha spirit of its sisters the Moana Surfrider and the Royal Hawaiian, it is much less expensive, and it is still centrally and ideally located.

Well, after walking into room 579, how can you be anything but? View of the parking lot and trash bins; old, worn, dirty grout in the bathroom, small room, door locks not working (not good for a woman here alone). I tried to book a better room but it wasn't available. However from the reviews, I'm probably better off not paying the extra money anyway. Upon check in the young man at the desk wasn't very helpful, even when I told him it's my birthday and I'm here alone because I have to attend some business meetings. I requested a room on a higher floor away from the elevator so I could rest when I got done with my day-long meetings. He could care less. My room wasn't ready at 2pm, all he kept repeating is ""check in is at 3pm""! This is the first time I've ever come to Waikiki one hour before check in time and I was told the room wasn't ready(and I've been here 3 times in the last 6 weeks, but at a different hotel), but maybe they are that busy! I have to say that the young lady who gave me the keys at 2:50 (I decided to ask if the room was ready a little earlier once I saw another desk agent was available) was extremely nice and tried to upgrade me but said the rooms were all booked. She also offered to send a complimentary bottle of wine to my room for my birthday! Now that's Aloha service! Someone train the other kid quick or let him go. Anyway, I digress! Today is my first day here and I avoided coming back to the room for as long as possible so I don't have to sit in this dreary room for too long! Lesson learned- next time I'm going back to my usual hotel! I thought I'd give is a try because someone in my company had said they stayed here before! Maybe they got a better room?

However, speaking strictly regarding the two rooms we stayed in at the old section (not the tower rooms) I was surpized at the level the room was kept. The walls were bare except for a picture on one and a bath robe hook (?) in the middle of another one. The furniture had to be from the late 1970/s and was beat enough to show every year of use. The bed was comfortable and standard for Sheratons, but even the bathroom was of a caliber more associated with a Super 8 than a Sheraton. Again, the tower may have been renovated, but the main hotel rooms were obviously never touched. Keep this in mind if you stay here. Many people say when they visit Hawaii, its not about the rooms but the closeness to the beach. If thats the case, then this might fit your needs. However, usually one stays at a Starwood for the room as well as the location. Not strictly the location. On that note, it is across the street from the Moana Surfrider and in a good location for a quick walk to both the beach and for shopping.

The Honolulu Coffee that is located right outside the pool area is decent but very expensive (Starbucks is cheaper). There are three towers, each with distinctively different rooms. The biggest tower at 29 floors have excellent rooms while one of the other towers have significantly smaller rooms. Rooms are clean, come with lots of towels, hair dryer and lots of pillows. Staff are very friendly and helpful. If I needed anything, it was promptly attended to.There was live entertainment every night. It was usually a band in the evening and a one man show with a guitar at the hotel bar towards the later hours of the evening. You could not hear this from most rooms and did not disturb in any way. I would say this entertainment is geared towards the older crowd and as such would not consider this a party hotel but better for business travelers, families and couples.

This hotel is more reasonable than others in the Oahu Starwood family and affords a choice of various views from individual lanais. Although we love the ocean view, the pool view offers a view of nightly entertainment from the comfort of your own room (request poolview with view of the stage minus palmtrees). The hotel offers a Starwood dine-around option and parking is included in the mandatory resort fee. Rooms are comfy with a frig. Housekeeping is very friendly and helpful. The pool is a good size and the pool guy is great! (The only criticism really was that management should tell the young male lobby personnel to be alot more attentive to the needs of ALL quests...it seemed they could not be bothered to give us directions, say, to a local street two blocks away or address our other questions.) The hotel is nicely located to public transportation (we use bus passes all the time and rent a car occasionally to travel to the North Shore) and is across the street from the beach. It is near the pick up for the free HIlo Hattie shuttle and many fine restaurants and entertainment as well as shopping. The Princess is adjacent to the New International Marketplace, scheduled to open 2015. (We love Saks, but we mourn for the return of the old marketplace vendors and eateries under the old Banyan Tree that were truly a tourist delight....I quess Trump and the Outrigger have started the trend to upscale Waikiki and thus it continues; but we feel it is at the cost of Aloha!) The Princess is a place of abundant history, so ask if they still have tours of the hotel and its sister property across the street, the Moana. This hotel offers a good taste of Hawaii at a resonable price.

While the map did not lie - the location is great, the story told by the pictures was a lot less veracious. The hotel is not horrible, but my low rating reflects as much a disappointment of my expectation as the issues with the hotel.Upon check-in we were told that our ocean-view reservation was upgraded to a handicap accessible room, which would provide a better view. The room was on the 12th floor of the western tower, facing east, with the views of the ocean, east Waikiki, Diamond Head, and the hotel courtyard, and these views were indeed spectacular. It was quite noisy - despite the 12th floor, the noise from the street traffic, the evening shows on stage in the courtyard, and the nightly performances of the street dance crew right outside the hotel measured at 77 dB on the balcony. The sliding door in the room did not do much to block the noise. This door did not do much to block the heat either - coupled with the aging, poorly designed AC system, the room was always hot and very humid, even after running a whole night. The only modern part of the electrical system was the thermostat, which was smart enough to shut the system off while we were out of the room, so we could not leave it running to keep the room cool for when we come back, which made for a very miserable experience.The room was quite small, and the two double beds did not leave much room for the chair and the vicker armchair, making it feel cramped. The bedding was clean and the comforters fluffy, but the pillows were not supportive at all. Both beds were slanted to one side, and the mattresses would easily slide to the side off the boxspring, making the person sleeping on the hanging-off side feel like he was about to fall off. Flat sheets, which were not long enough to wrap around the foot of the mattress, would untuck the moment we pulled out the bed covers to get into bed.The carpets were old and grungy, and other than the view through the sliding door, which was great, the room decor would be best described as 1960s low-end - it did not look redecorated since being built. The room had a flat-screen TV, a mini-fridge, and a safe which did not work. The closet had sliding doors with paint which was beginning to peel off, and the entry door also looked a bit warped and peeling. The real disappointment was the bathroom, which was described to us as handicap accessible. It had a warped barn-style door, with the sliding track on the outside. Because it was not straight, and had layers of peeling paint, it would not seal off the odors or the humidity of the bathroom, which incidentally has no exhaust vent. In service of accessibility, the bathtub was replaced with a plastic enclosure with a straight curtain rod running straight above the edge. With the grab bars protruding from the wall side, there was not enough shoulder room to shower without rubbing against the curtain. The bottom lip did not contain the water inside the shower enclosure, so it was running on the floor, until we thought of barricading it with the towels. The towels were thin and small, so we ended up using pool towels for showering also. The counter was old and worn out. The faucet used to be painted white, but the paint had peeled off from about half of the metal, furthering the dumpy feel of the room. The door couldn't lock, or even slide fully closed.The building has ~30 floors (there are two other buildings which make up the hotel). It had 4 small elevators, one of which was broken for half of our stay. It was hardly surprising, as the elevators seemed in poor condition from the start, with the indicator lights burned out and not replaced (this is a former elevator engineer talking). Still, to get up we had to wait 15+ minutes to fit into the elevators, and to go down during the evening rush hour took even longer. After waiting for 20 minutes, we decided to take the stairs, only to discover that they were disgustingly dirty. We mentioned the broken elevator to the clerk at the front desk, whose reply was ""Oh, really? I will see what we can do"" - nothing was done during the rest of our stay.Our hotel stay turned out to be an interesting multi-cultural experience - other than ourselves and a small contingent of Canadian soldiers on the islands for a military exercise, every other guest at the hotel seemed to be Chinese. They have a higher tolerance for being packed sausage-tight into the elevators, which you pretty much have to do even with all the elevators in service. Not being used to the high-rise living, I found the experience to be annoying, and the excruciatingly long waits to get into the elevator only raised my anxiety levels.The lobby is clean and spacious, but open to the outside, so you feel all the humidity and heat with none of the cooling breezes of being out on the street. The staff were friendly, even if not always helpful. There was a buffet breakfast ($25) and dinner ($40-42) served in the lobby restaurant - I think normally this restaurant is operating in another part of the main floor, which was being refurbished.The main floor opens up on the courtyard, which has a fairly large pool with lounges, a poolside bar with tables, and a stage, where most nights there were live performances. The hotel bills itself as a resort, and charges a little over $26 per day of a resort fee (including tax). This is a good value, as it covers the parking, internet, pool towels, and usage of the pool and other fitness facilities. You can also borrow a beach chair to go to the beach, which is not quite across the street, but is really close. Apparently, they also have a beachside fruit service for the hotel guests twice during the day, though we haven't experienced it. One issue is that some of these resort facilities, usage of the pool, towel exchange, beach chair rental, close very early in the evening - most nights at 7 PM, and some nights as early as 5. This means that you need to tailor your schedule to that of the hotel, rather than it being the other way around, as I feel it should be at a resort. Despite all these gripes, the hotel is in a central location, with the street below full of high-end stores, much like Rodeo Drive. The evenings are full of energy, and the sidewalks are full of pedestrians (mostly Asians), street performers, and homeless people. There is a small stage by the beach, where there are Hawaiian-themed performances. The beaches are packed with people, and the wave-breakers make for a very calm water to wade in, save for all the people splashing. There is an ever-present swarm of surfers a few hundred yards out in the ocean, beyond the breakers.Being in the thick of things is both a blessing and a curse - all the food establishments there, including low-priced chains like Subway, KFC, Burger King, McDonalds, carry a hefty tourist premium. Originally I thought that this was the case everywhere on the islands, but the last day we ventured to the south-east end of the island, away from the touristy areas, and discovered that the same chains were only slightly more expensive than the mainland, and significantly cheaper than Waikiki. Another issue is traffic congestion - there is a lot of it everywhere in Honolulu, and even more so in Waikiki. There is a lot of one-way streets, and the main drag has an interesting arrangement of lights, which favors pedestrians over vehicles. This makes even a seemingly short trip take a long time. While the distances are generally short, going anywhere requires you to make an arduous trek to the freeway (which has a speed limit of 35-45 mph most of the way through the city). This hotel is good if you are after the experience of the tourist vibe, proximity to the beach, and the nighttime entertainment. On the other hand, if you are looking for rest and relaxation at a beachside resort, I would recommend you look elsewhere.","Scottsdale, AZ","PickyBizTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scottsdale, AZ</strong>",89,2.0

Great location, excellent staff, lovely rooms (if not a little dated), genuine all round great stay. There is some modernisation being undertaken right now, which, when completed, can only enhance your stay. We had no problems at all staying here. We had a room on the 5th floor of the main block (not tower) overlooking the pool area. We had a great balcony, if not a little small, with a partial view of the ocean. Yes the pool is a little crowded, and perhaps too small for a hotel of this size, but who needs a pool when you have the entire Pacific Ocean a couple of hundred metres away? The only downside I have is the resort fee. Definitely not worth the money unfortunately, you'd have to go some to get the value out of it. A few bottles of water and free internet access does not warrant $25 per day I'm sorry to say. At least consider a pay as you go resort fee that way people are only paying for what they actually use.

You can find better eating within a five minute walk at a MUCH lower price.The other negative is the 'Resort Fee'. This was, I recall about $12 - $13 per day in 2011, now its $25, a 100% increase, for what they describe as 'valuable extra services'.In reality, these are nothing of the kind....internet access, which is generally free in hotels around the world, parking (great if you actually have a car to park), a couple of bottles of water in your room every day, AND, if you are on the beach at the right time (times vary) an extra bottle of water and an apple or orange (your choice). Woopy Doo! And that's the extent of these 'valuable extra services'.My personal opinion is that that the resort fee is way too much and is simply a grab for extra dollars. We have decided that as a matter of pinciple, and solely due to the resort fee, we will not return to this hotel.That said, apparently the Moana Surfrider across the road is charging a $50 resort fee. Wow! Who's silly enough to pay that?","Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","David L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</strong>",29,4.0

You can walk up and down Waikiki rather easily and it's right across the street from the beach. But the best part is that parking and internet use is included in the hotel's resort fee. OK - all of the hotels charge a resort fee now, so accept it. And $25 to park your car in Waikiki and have internet access is a deal.

Our main complaints are that the rooms are dated, the front desk was not accommodating and there was massive construction next door. To start with the rooms, it was clear that nothing had been updated since the 80's and it was pretty small. The view from our side of the hotel was a giant construction project right underneath us. When I asked to change rooms to avoid the eyesore, the hotel wanted to charge us an upgrade fee because there was nothing of equal value available on the other side of the hotel. In terms of the help, one front desk employee; Jahan was actually terrible. He was difficult to work with when we ordered food to the hotel, refused to heat it up for us and then canceled our taxi to the airport without letting us know. He did all of this even though on arrival we gave the front desk our cell phone number and let them know all of this would be happening.

We asked to move rooms immediately and had the most enormous run-around from the front-desk staff, who came up with various (and ever-changing) excuses as to why this was not possible.

This was in the small block facing the pool, and with an ocean view over the top of the hotel across the road. Our room was comfortable and well-appointed, if a little in need of a refurb.

I remember getting out of the cab and walking Into the reception area and just wanting to cry. It took 35 mins before we were served and another 25 min to check us in. Taking deep breathes I was telling myself it will get better. Again I was so very wrong. The actual hotel is very old and outdated. There is a smell that lingers around the hotel and its not very pleasant. The pictures I saw of the sheraton princess when researching hotels in Waikiki were quiet nice and the hotel did look old but not outdated. When we walked into our room it took me a while to take everything in. The bed was messed up as if some one had been sitting on it, there were stains on the wall and in the corners on the floor there were dust balls with hair,the smell was horrendous, which was coming from sewage from the bathroom, the furniture was so old and worn out it was unbelievable!!I cried and cried. My husband who is a typical male and nothing bothers him was in shock as well. I went straight to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. He was polite but seemed unfazed at the fact that I was so upset and that made me angry. He said the best he could do was give us vouchers for dinner that night and that I should understand that I have not booked a new and modern hotel. That made me more angry and I demanded that I speak to someone who can do something. I then was speaking to another manager explaining everything all over again and said if she could not help me that I would like a full refund and would go somewhere else. She then popped up her shoulders and asked me to wait a minute she then came back and told me she had found us another room that would be a lot more pleasant for our stay. We were moved to another room on a higher level. It was nice, still outdated and old but a lot more cleaner than the other room. The Resturant there is horrible, we used our dinner voucher there and all I could eat was bread rolls the food is just terrible and cold. My husband, who again is the most laid back person could not manage to put anything in his mouth. The pool is nothing like the photos I saw on their website. It looks as if some disease is brewing in their, the colour of the water is quiet scary, needless to say we never used the pool. I would defiantly go back to Hawaii but never go back to the sheraton princess, it really ruined my holiday, it was so upsetting to me that we paid so much for the accommodation and it was really a 2 star hotel. Please just be aware of the photos on their website, they are really deceiving and photo shopped. It is nothing like it seems on the website.",Sydney,"Beka_bs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",10,1.0

I was told by some people at the hotel that the hotel will be remodeled sometime in August. Hopefully, this is going to happen as the status it was in when I stayed there didn't, in my opinion, live up to the Sheraton name.Staff: Extreme inconsistency when it came to the quality of staff service.Let's talk about the good service:My housekeeper Belinda was very thorough in her service. She was also very friendly and helpful. There was a lady at the front desk and I think her name is Erin. She was also very helpful and friendly.The Bad: I was in line at the front desk behind two Japanese ladies waiting to be served. There were two clerks there at the time and one was assisting some other customers. The only lady who was available did not acknowledge our existence in any way. First, she was busy talking with another staff. Then she disappeared into a room, completely ignoring our presence. We were all shocked as to how she treated people. There was also another male clerk (at another time) who was very rude. Again, I couldn't believe I was staying at a Sheraton!There was a Burger King right across the street from the hotel. But the food was very expensive. I recall a combo meal cost me about US$10. There were some other restaurants in the same shopping complex. And, of course, they cost more than Burger King.Fortunately, there was a food court (about a 15 - 20 minute walk) from the hotel. The food was not really cheap either. If you're in a budget and want to try something local and reasonable, I would suggest going to a ABC store (there were several near the hotel) and purchased a Musubi. Some musubi comes with spam; while there are those that come with chicken etc. (Different ABC stores carry different kinds of musubi. Depending on how big your appetite is, one musubi can be a meal. You can ask the clerk at ABC to heat up the musubi for you. Also, go early as choices can be limited if you're late.All in all, if it's not for the few ""nice"" employees at Sheraton, I would have given this hotel a ""poor"" overall rating. Hopefully, the hotel and some employees' attitudes, services... can be improved ASAP.",Oregon,"OregonTraveler9999</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oregon</strong>",92,3.0

It is in a nice location. Close to a lot of shopping and also the many street acts at night. To me Waikiki is similar to Las Vegas with the street shows. On some nights, there was live hawaiian music near the pool which was a nice touch. The koi ponds near the front entrance were small but nice. The kids enjoyed it. For those who are going to take tours with Roberts hawaii/ booked their trips through Costco, the bus pick up is across the street next to the Hyatt. Unfortunately the international market closed down which was only steps away. This was a decent place to go if you wanted to shop and bargain with vendors for souvenirs and other Hawaiian goods. Similar to the swap meet or flea market. Now for the rooms, they were a little dated. After all it IS one of the older hotels in waikiki. We had a partial ocean view facing Diamond Head and it was plenty a view from the private balcony. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and also the Royal Hawaiian shopping area almost right across the street. Overall this hotel is decent because of its location but the rooms do need some upgrading. ",San diego,"Socalcajudo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San diego</strong>",2,4.0

We both have very mixed feelings about all of it, however its best to list out the good and the unfortunate items:Positives:- Location – it really is a 5 minute walk to the beach. I wouldn't even say 10 minutes…perhaps if you are really slow. The convenience and reduction of cost in not being right on the beach is well worth it, as you can even walk through the hotel across the way to get to beach if you want to.- We had a “high tower ocean view” – floor 15. It was a nice view, unfortunately somewhat blocked by neighboring properties, but there’s not much you can do about that no matter how high you go. Balcony is large and it was relaxing to sit and see the ocean, or at night…the city lights up the hills on the other side. The “high tower ocean view” rooms fortunately do not face the neighboring properties under construction, so we lucked out.- Room was clean and housekeeping staff did a GREAT job making up the room each day and replenishing soap, paper, water, etc. They were also friendly and greeted us each morning as we left.- Bell staff was not especially friendly, however they were fast and accommodating. We didn't have to wait much at all for our bags, or for a cab to be hailed. They do an efficient job.- Bed and pillows were clean and comfortable – no issues here. Bathroom was also clean with fresh towels each day.- Fridge was decent. Wish there was a microwave, however you can get one for an extra fee. In-room safe is actually pretty large – bigger than others I’ve seen at other hotels in the past.- Pool and outside pool bar area are nice and inviting. There is a small waterfall and koi pond…the ambiance is nice. Pool-side evening entertainment was also pleasant.- Mandatory Resort fee includes free Wi-Fi and free parking in the adjacent garage – this is helpful and convenient.Unfortunate Items:- When we checked in, we were handed our room cards and a few other things, but otherwise no explanation of anything. Check-in was literally 1 minute, which included collecting payment info for the resort fee. It was only a few days later that I actually looked through the items handed to us to realize we had pool cards that would give us free towels and beach chairs as well as fruit and whatnot…so basically a nice beachside service. This was not explained to us and there’s nothing in the room letting you know about that either. So it’s up to a nice front desk clerk to let you know about that, otherwise you discover it yourself. Also apparently we had a free photo we could have had – did not know about this one either. I have only realized that by reading the reviews below.- The hotel is under some remodeling, most noticeably in main lobby and lobby/street-level floor. During our entire stay, there were painters, people hammering, people putting tarps or drop cloths up, men busting up tile, jack hammering, etc. Pretty much anything you can think of with a standard remodel. Would have been nice to know this, as we probably might have stayed somewhere else. I don’t know why they don’t choose to do the bulk of these repairs at night, when there is little to no activity in the lobby. Furthermore, anytime we wanted to use the “Internet Café” (which otherwise was actually really cool and they have several stations with 2 printers it seems) we couldn’t, because the computers were covered or disabled in some manner so men could work in that area. - Breakfast and Dinner buffet are a joke. I’m sorry to say that but for the price of nearly $30/person, there should be about 4 times more food put out there. Also, it’s disconcerting when there are workmen breaking up tile and pieces of tile are flying around right by the buffet items. Poor planning on this one. Who knows what is flying into the food. It was our last day and we were checking out, so I did not bother to complain on that one. There are several other restaurants around the area within a 5 minute walk that you can eat at – however most are pretty pricey as well, so be prepared.- Front desk staff is a mixed bag – a few were nice, most were not. Only one individual was really nice and helpful, and we did not catch his name. He worked a night shift at the check-in desk and gave us good advice on things to see and where to go. Probably the only really friendly person there. Otherwise, the lady running the Travel/Tours desk is not very friendly unless you want to purchase something directly from her or the hotel. There is also a man who works the same desk – he wasn’t friendly at all. When we asked him how we could get to the North Shore part of the island he just looked at us dumbfounded and told us to use the freeway. I asked for a map and he finally gave us a really bad photocopy of one. Concierge was neither friendly nor unfriendly – we once talked to a young woman and the 2nd time, a young man. Both were just “ok”. Really made us feel like our questions were not that important, but at least they weren’t rude.- Exterior of the hotel needs a facelift, mostly rooms not facing the street…but facing adjacent properties. You can see the deterioration of balconies/stucco and rusted railings from the outside.- Neighboring properties on both sides are under construction. This really isn’t the fault of the Sheraton PK, it’s just unfortunate. The International Marketplace is closed and won’t open again until 2016. There’s a lot of noise and construction from that side. There is also a neighboring hotel that is completely being redone, and quite a bit of noise from that as well, and an ugly view if you’re on that side. The sad part is, this actually could be a nice property if all this junk wasn’t going on and staff were trained to be consistent on friendliness and helpfulness. We loved the openness of the lobby into the pool area and getting that island breeze through there. I think after renovations are done…it will be a nice place to stay. Rooms are a little tired, however you spend most of your day away from the hotel and exploring the island, so who cares if the carpet is a little old and the bathroom tile is a little outdated. And I think if we had encountered more friendly staff than those who were rude, maybe we’d have a better overall opinion here….but since we don’t, we would not stay here again and would recommend others to do their research and find out what’s going on with the hotel you’re planning to book, or wait until the Sheraton PK is done with all its renovations.","Mesa, Arizona","Desert_Kat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mesa, Arizona</strong>",44,2.0

It was a last minute booking via hotels.com as we hadn't planned on staying in Waikiki before flying back home. Checking in was fine, we were even given an upgrade to a 7th floor room with partial ocean view. In spite of what seemed to be constant, chronic chaos in the front desk/lobby area, the front desk staff were professional and courteous. It appears that renovations are underway, as I saw exposed wiring and freshly painted walls in the check in area and beyond. Our room was respectable, my hubby enjoyed the flat screen TV. The two beds were narrow but clean and adequate for our needs. The carpet could be cleaner, but the bathroom was clean so that was good. Complimentary water was provided in the room, and a mini fridge too, which sat atop a safe in the ample closet. Great fir keeping drinks cold for awhile :).We didn't eat here as the dining area carried a weird smell and the food looked less than inviting. So we ate at the Jimmy Buffets a few minutes walking distance away. Be prepared for a chaotic feel at the hotel entrance- there were always dozens of ppl coming back and forth with several piles of bags and suitcases lying around. A bit disorganized. However, the hotel is well located close to Waikiki Beach and all the high end shops. I would not consider staying here again unless serious renos were completed. Would recommend staying in Ko Olina outside of Waikiki, which is where we spent our first 6 nights at the JW Marriott Ihilani. If Waikiki beach and shopping isn't that big a deal to you, then stay in Ko Olina. Rent a car and do a day trip into Waikiki, which is what we did.

We were given an upgrade to a deluxe ocean view which Ihave to day had we paid for it we would have been at the front desk complaining the room was only slightly bigger than the ocean view rooms, the lanai was smaller than those of the ocean view rooms the view was mainly of the moana hotel with the ocean showing above it and also of the swimming pool but at night the noise from the street was loud and you could hear the group playing by the pool with the lanai doors shut. Speaking of the lanai doors they were heavy to move we asked maintenance on two occassion to oil them and it was done on the second request which helped for most of our stay but not all of it as they were sticking again before we left. Can't comment on the hotel food as we only ate breakfast once as we had a complimentary ticket, the reason we didn't use it was all meals were way too expensive, you can get far more reasonable prices outside. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful the female conceige was useless the male was very good and most helpful. The pool staff were great. Housekeeping well whilst being nice and firendly one day our room didn't get made up at all, the bathroom was not cleaned except for changing out the towels, the bedroom never dusted and the lanai wasn't cleaned at all thoughout our stay.

Yes renovations are taking place and as I understand it the hotel will now close next year for extensive renovations, hopefully this will improve the so called deluxe rooms however it will probably mean I will not be able to stay as the price will be elevated way out of my price range.

The hotel is slowly being tidied up - this was happening while we were there but gave us little trouble. We had a pretty good room - sea views. The Moana Surfrider is across the road on the beach side so you have to take into account that there is a lower building in front of yours but hey, when you come from the country, a view of the ocean is something to be marvelled at. The weather was perfect so I am sure that will colour all my reviews but the Sheraton PK is in a great spot for shopping, beaching, and of course all the restaurants that are arms length away. Some people have said that for a Sheraton the PK is disappointing. It's true it's tired and we had a chest of drawers with very dodgy drawers and a fridge that on the first night woke us up. But my husband kicked it and it was fine after that. We were staying at the PK because friends and family were so for all of us it worked brilliantly. The breakfast is great. You can have a full buffet or a continental. I had the continental and it was very very nice. Most mornings though we would get something from the little coffee pod at the front of the gates and have it on the balcony of our room. One of the things I particularly liked about the layout of the hotel is that generally you pass through the pool area and that was where we would all bump into each other during the day and make our plans for the afternoon or evening. It felt very communal. Every time you stay somewhere your feelings will always be dictated by a number of things but I do think the PK is good for what it is.

Our room was so so, but as rates had gone up, we could only afford a partial ocean view, which is very, very partial and more wall view. You would think because we have returned for a fourth year in a row, they would have tried to keep us happy. Also..bar service around the pool was non existant. If you wanted service, you had to jump up and down to get their attention, then do the same for another drink. There were many staff that we remember from years gone by, that were awesome. Debbie at the buffet and the pool staff (Lauren I think) were still great, but as a whole, I was very disappointed.

When security came, they seemed to think that it could not have just fallen off the wall, as if we caused it somehow. So the manager asked us if we wanted to move to another room, which we did (the AC wasn't working properly anyway and had to have maintenance come and fix it earlier in the evening). They moved us quickly to a lower room facing the International Marketplace, which, sadly, is being torn down. Needless to say, I did not get back to sleep because of the construction noise outside of my room. when we returned that night to our new room, it wasn't even made up. The security guard gave us coupons for free breakfast, which was nice of him, but I wish I could say that of the rest of the staff. When I checked out, the guest services guy didn't ask how my stay was. He charged my card, and I asked if I could get some sort of a discount as I had a terrible experience (I explained everything that happened). He waived the resort fee ($50), which hardly seemed enough to me, but I didn't make a fuss. If we had been up and about when the mirror fell, someone could have been seriously hurt, or worse.

Only couple good things about this resort fee is they give you 2 water bottles and 60 min of phone calls if you needed. Remember to call the front dest every time you need to make a phone call. The city view rooms are very noisy because they are near tourist bus pick up hub. Concierge service was not good.

We were unsure of what the smell was but upon investigating the room, nothing was clean! It was horrible to see dirty finger smudges on walls, light switches, bathroom fixtures. I immediately talked to an uninterested local bruddah with pierced ears at the front desk who told me that he'd have housekeeping stop by to freshen the room up. I informed him (let's leave his nameless, i'm sure ownership will deal with this guy) we had a constant leak above our shower, chipped walls and broken furniture. The sheets and pillows smelled like urine. He simply replied ""ok"" with no compensation or room moves offered. We ended up at WalMart to purchase cheap pillows, sheets, and cleaning supplies. When we arrived back, housekeeping didn't show up as promised. We ended up putting a Do Not Disturb sign on our door so that we could keep track of our bedding and belongings. We informed the front desk and concierge of our concerns but nothing was done. Heck I even posted something on twitter to grab the attention of ownership. Upon checkout, I voiced my concerns and frustrations with the Front Desk Agent. She said that she would pass the information along to her boss and took my guest comment card.

Sadly, for a business traveler I cannot recommend this at all. For a family, same thing - 2 thumbs down. The rates were higher than much nicer properties I've visited, the room was a bit of a wreck, and the noise was awful. The staff were very average (a few of the private vendors were friendly, but those were the only happy faces I saw). I heard they're going to be closing for renovations in the near future, and perhaps that explains the dresser drawer that wouldn't stay closed, dust around the middle of the lamps, the stains on the carpet and chairs, the short shower curtain with straight (vs curved) rod that didn't really keep the floor dry. The elevators were often overflowing so getting to/from the room proved challenging time to time, and the restaurants were expensive (there are less expensive places around the area and farmer's markets a few nights a week). A band started at 10P somewhere in the area and kept me awake until midnight each night I was there. The bed lifted in the middle so avoiding a tumble to the floor felt awkward. In spite of the higher rates, this property charges $10 per day for a microwave and $14 a day for wireless internet service in the room. Computers are available in the lobby for those who wish to use them, though printing and time online is limited. The pool looked lovely and evening bands playing near the pool sounded great.

No room service after 10pm, so if you get in late, too bad! No kettles in the rooms only a poor coffee maker, broken safes in both rooms. For a Sheraton it was appalling. Pool closes at 6pm, and needed work. Worst Hotel i have stayed in as a frequent traveler. For Sheraton very very poor. They offer one hour free a day phone calls to any destination in the world, classed as a part of your resort fee, good luck getting a call through to Australia!!!

It had a fairly decent sized balcony and if you looked to the left you could see the ocean. To me the only downside to this was because the area is so built up it reminded me of Benidorm, lots of high rise hotels and plenty of sunshine.

Having read some reviews here I was absolutely shocked how picky and stupid some reviews can be. We knew this Sheraton was only a 3 star property at time of us booking. Yes this did surprise us that a Sheraton does have properties rating at only 3 star so our expectations werent overally high. Now despite this we thought its not going to be anything too special. Check in was very slow but yes its a busy time of year. We asked for a room away from noise and traffic but I don't think it happened. Our room was noisy as we were close to traffic noise. Yes this hotel is dated (like most hotels in Waikiki) and its 3 star hotel but we were told it is getting demolished in August 2014. One thing that absolutely shocked me that someone's review stated that this hotel would be ""like staying in a backpackers"". Oh my god, obviously whoever they are haven't travelled much or ever stayed in a real backpackers. Having stayed in many backpackers around the world this place is definitely NOT a backpackers place. Our room was clean and comfortable but in a noisy spot. Luckily shutting the door helpful a bit. The only thing was the aircon was a bit loud. After the first night our airconditioner stopped working and our room was hot when we returned from our day out. When we rang guest services we had a guy come up straight away to check it out. Within a few minutes we were told we would have to move rooms. OK, that is fine because it was definitely uncomfortable without airconditioning. Within minutes we got a call from the manager telling us that we can move to another room and someone will come up and help with our luggage. OK, you would expect to be moved if aircon wasn't working but I must say this issue was resolved so quickly that we were happy with their customer service. We were surprised just how quickly they did this as a lot of places you would have to wait and wait. I actually rang the manager at guest services and thanked them for such prompt service. Our second room was bigger and cooler which was nice but the safe didn't work. We just didn't bother with it. There was loud music till about 9.30pm each night here but that was not an issue with us. The pool area isn't as big as I thought. The food here was a bit pricey and the quality was ok but could be better for the price. We were given beach chairs and water and fruit for our days on the beach (was included in resort fee). Also this was the only hotel in our Hawaii trip where our wifi actually worked so that was relief. Ok, this hotel is dated, but the rooms were clean and comfortable and well even with our room issue the service was very good. Its in a great location so close to everything. Its not right on the beach but one street away.

This hotel is in such bad shape and has been needing renovations across the board for many years now. The carpets are terrible, A/C never cold enough, popcorn ceilings, outdated furnishings, terrible mattresses, dirty bathrooms, and so on. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra 20-30 dollars or even the same rate and stay somewhere else / anywhere else. Room cleanliness is a must for me and the last 3 times I've stayed here there have been multiple issues.

Sadly, our room was beyond being disappointing--it was disgusting. The bathroom was not clean and had a hole in the ceiling that looked like it was letting in creepy crawlies, the hallway to get to the room was depressing and dated. But what really disturbed us is that the room overlooked the garbage cans. When we opened the lanai door to step out not only was the view unacceptable (even at a budget hotel), but the cans were open. As you can imagine, in a humid place like Oahu, the garbage cans were emitting the most disgusting smells. To make matters worse, the airco was loud and made cranking sounds. But we couldn't figure out how to turn it off--except by opening the lanai! Admittedly, if we were staying longer, we would have demanded to be moved but instead just spent our short time there out of the room.

The parking is included in the resort fee, so that also makes it a convenient choice. We hired a car from across the road in the foyer of the Hyatt Regency, and we did our grocery shopping at the Food Pantry on Kuhio, 1 street behind the hotel. The beach is just a short stroll across the road. The pool is nice and deep and offers plenty of beach chairs around it. The laundry is in the basement and it was handy to do a load of washing, they have change machines located in the laundry room. We had no complaints about any of the services (housekeeping, front desk, room service). On this visit we stayed 4 nights at this Sheraton and then checked into the Sheraton Waikiki for the next week. See my other review for the Sheraton Waikiki. We wanted our children (aged 10 & 14) to enjoy both Sheraton properties.I did visit the hotel next door to do a comparison (Holiday Inn Beachcomber) and did note the rooms are a bit larger and more renovated. The pool at the Beachcomber however is smaller and not as nice as the Sheraton.

We arrived early and we were told that we had been upgraded to a room which a ocean view, because we arrived early we were allowed to leave our bags at the luggage hold facility. The room was pretty good and the view from the room was amazing!! (So glad we got upgraded). We got complimentary bottles of water everyday and a gift basket on arrival which was really great as we went on day tours and didn't have to worry about buying water to take with us. The bed was really comfy and we were able to sleep really well in it each night. The bathroom looked a bit out dated but it was clean. The hotel does look a bit out dated and it was a bit pricey for a three star hotel but for the location we didn't mind it. It was close to the beach, buses to Ala Monana shopping centre and Honolulu, the markets and lots of eateries. The staff were professional and always greeted you when you entered and left the premises. Most tour buses leave from the hotel opposite (Hyatt) so it was confusing sometimes as to where we were suppose to meet but other than that it was a very enjoyable stay.

It is an older hotel in need of upgrades. The location itself is great as it is in the heart of Waikiki just across from the Westin Moana Surfrider so everything is within walking distance.When we arrived at the hotel the reception had a hard time finding my reservation and insisted that it might be another hotel with a similar name. Thank goodness I had the reservation number in my phone. Well he found it due to the fact he did not spell my name correctly ( even though I spelled it out and is only 3 letters long ). He then had difficulties getting my rooms arranged and the CC reader wasn't working well.We finally made it to our room and the rooms were OK. There is no thermostat to control the room temperature. It was AC on high, low or off. The satellite TV had poor reception due to the winds I guess (not that you are going to watch a lot of television when in Hawaii). The balcony is tiny with a small table and 2 chairs squeezed in. There is a small fridge in the closet and that was nice to keep some drinks cold. The rooms have no sound insulation at ALL!! Our neighbours were loud and you can hear all their conversations. They stayed up late and got up early so basically we did not get much sleep. Received a note under the door the next day saying they need a credit card to secure the second room. I went down and the front person was quite rude saying it is necessary. I don't doubt that by why was it not taken care of when I registered in the first place. Both rooms were in my name and registered as such. She could have been nicer saying they dropped the ball and could have been more apologetic. Instead she made it feel like it was my fault that I was trying to scam them.The hotel is very busy with big tours and there is a lot of traffic. Not much to do within the hotel itself.

The main floor lobby and pool of the hotel are attractive, the price to stay here is excessive.Forget about eating in their restaurant, it is not worth it at $39.95 for a dinner buffet with few items other than crab legs. Their other menu for daytime dining was excessively priced as well. Drinks at the bar by the pool were also expensive, without the expected quality of liquor at these prices.There is a mandatory daily resort fee of $23.95 which gives you ""Complimentary"" -ha ha!! Wi-Fi internet access that is extremely limited in bandwidth. I was unable to send even a text email with their ""Complimentary"" internet access.On the bright side, your resort fee does include attached parkade parking so, if you rent a vehicle, that is very good value.The rooms are 'okay' but a little dated. The bathroom and shower have the black mold beginning to appear in the silicone sealant. -This is a normal, frequent occurance that can be managed with more attention to detailed cleaning.This is a non-smoking hotel but some people still 'sneak' smoke within their rooms. I am an 'outdoors only' smoker and still found the smoke that drifted into my suite intolerable, to the extent that it would wake me up in the night. -I can't imagine the revulsion a non-smoker would experience.There was a very nice view from my room, pool plus partial ocean view and Diamond head.The rooms are not sound proof and you hear the constant automatic slamming of doors from other hotel rooms. Even conversations from the next room!!! The patio doors are also not particularly sound proof so you do hear any excessive noise that is occurring on street level, even from 9 floors up!!I found the bed quite comfortable but the pillows were way too soft, even with 4 stacked!!I did submit feedback to the hotel regarding my disappointments but received no reply. To me, this says they don't particularly care. Rumor has it that the hotel is scheduled for demolition in the very near future, like December or early 2014.Location is very convenient but, if you are out after 10:00 pm, expect to see several prostitutes in the area. It didn't feel unsafe but some people are just uncomfortable with the mere presence of prostitutes in the near vicinity.I would recommend staying somewhere else, maybe even with a kitchenette, where you can spend a little less money once in a while by making your own breakfast or whatever.Hope this helps.

I was expecting the the standards of a Sheraton but instead was shocked to find one of the worst hotels I've seen. This is not up to the standard of any of their other properties! Old, dirty, broken and infested!Our first room was extremely musty and the A/C didn't work. The carpet was stained, there were holes in the blinds, and the bed side lights did not work. It was small and old and generally dirty. I called down about the A/C and they said I could look at another room one floor up.The second room looked like the first but the A/C worked. It was slightly musty and the lights worked but honestly it looked like it hadn't been updated since the 80s. My roommate tweeted pictures of our first room and they called us to see at that point if we wanted to see a third room in the tower. The third room was in the tower and seems like it was updated slightly more recently than the others. Perhaps the early 90s. This room had a weird blood-like stain in the bathroom. We took it out of frustration. Upon returning from dinner, I flicked on the lights and found a visitor on the bedside table. A COCKROACH! I tried to kill it but it escaped into the drawer. The hotel staff offered to come spray it or fumigate the room. But I have asthma and don't want to stay in a chemical fog. I just want a bug free clean nice room! We are stuck here because we pre-paid for the two nights through an Alaska Airlines vacation special. I'll NEVER do that again. We chose it because it is a Starwood property an because we wanted our last two nights to be relaxing and tranquil and special. I'll go so far as to say this has ruined my vacation. I've never been so disappointed in a hotel of this caliber.We also found out from the staff that it's due to be torn down next year. I just want to make sure no one else makes the mistake did.

I liked the location and the fact that most (if not all) all of the rooms have balconies. But after my most recent stay, I'm done with this property. I'm a loyal Starwood member but if I can't stay at a different affiliated property, I'll stay at the Marriott (see my review). While the actual room was OK, the bathroom was in disrepair. They should be embarrassed at charging $200+ a night for a room in that condition. I'll admit I'm terribly annoyed by resort fees, but at the very least I expect to be able to use the services provided for by the fee. I think it's ""amusing"" that as airlines unbundle fees and charge for those that passengers ""want,"" hotels are bundling fees together that I do not want and make it a mandatory fee. The only ""bundled"" fee I cared about was the Internet access (which I can get for free because of my status at most every other Starwood property but not here). I had 3 wifi enabled devices with me, and was only able to access the Internet once in 5 days for about 30 minutes before it dropped off. But I know my devices worked (one excuse the hotel used for my inability to connect) was that I was always able to connect in the lower level public areas of the hotel. I asked the front desk for assistance at least 3 times for this and another service issue and was met with either enthusiastic offers of assistance to indifference, but it didn't matter, no service commitment was followed through on (and the one time I asked to speak to a manager he/she was not available). Literally they would promise assistance within 15 minutes and an hour later I would still be waiting in the room with no help (and no note or voicemail apologizing and offering assistance). I started my stay at the Courtyard by Marriott (because no Starwood property had availability) and wish I'd stayed there. Give this property a pass. Oh, and there are prostitutes at the southeast corner of the property in the evening near Kalakau Avenue, annoying for guests that don't want to be bothered with that attention.","Anchorage, Alaska","cadence8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong>",56,2.0

As a result I found the room to be uncomfortably warm during the das and somewhat chilly at night.As for the staff, they were generally quite friendly , however an experience at the end of my stay significantly brought down the overall impression. Having realised that I had left a power converter and phone charger in my room I called the hotel 20 minutes after checking out, at 6 in the morning. I explained the situation and was assured that security would immediately go up to the room to retrieve the items. My friend, who was staying in Waikiki for another couple of days, could then pick them up later in the day. When he asked at reception in the afternoon, there was no record of the incident, and staff were indifferent and quite rude. I then called the hotel - from overseas, as I had travelled home - and also received sub-standard service. After being passed back and forth between Reception and Security, it culminated with the hotel's customer service manager telling me that 'there is nothing else we can do' and 'oh well, that's just the way it is...'.Thankfully the items weren't particularly valuable, but the inconvenience combined with the arrogant attitude of some hotel staff means that I for one won't be going back.","Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","399alexb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</strong>",16,2.0

There are many eatery's in the hotel and even more around it, it is a very centrally located hotel. We were able to use the bell rooms scales to weigh our bags before we hit the airport. The pool is open, only thing I wasnt too keen on was that it was open and it felt like random people could have rocked up to the pool but I guess you need to have a pool card (from reception for guests only) to get a towel. There was WIFI for a cost $14.95 per day cause we didnt need the other deals that came with the $25 combo tht is mostly suited for families with children. and th laundry room was below deck and frikkn hot...but we got through it lol. I didnt like that we had to park 15min away 'cause we didnt have parking in our combo but didnt realise this until we arrived so we paid another holtel around the corner to hold our van for a fraction of the cost that the Sheraton PK was going to charge us-Major downfall for what we were paying and there were always parks available.

It is well known that none of the hotels in Hawaii have AC in the corridors, but this Sheraton has practically no AC in the rooms as well. There is one knob in the room for AC with 3 levels: off, low, and High. Even at High, there is practically no movement of air in the room, leading to a muggy, suffocating, dirty room. I tried everything from opening the balcony door, sleeping on the floor right under the vent, adjusting the vent blades, etc, but could not sleep a wink.This, coupled with a pool that shuts down at 6pm, no lounge, and terrible views were reasons enough for me to pack up and leave for another hotel.

It’s clean and comfortable and the staff are very friendly and obliging but it certainly needs a reno and the soundproofing is practically non existent.

We did find a few tiny ants in our room but maybe only a dozen over the twelve days so more of a curiosity than anything else.

I was fine for us and housekeeping did a good job each day for us.If you're keeping a car there, when you first arrive, you will drop off your luggage with the attendant who will then direct you to park in the self parking structure. You can then check in at the lobby and the bell staff will bring your luggage to your room. Make note of your rental car details (make/model/color) since you need to provide this info when checking in and getting the car permit.For parking, the only elevator access is on the 3rd and 4th floors on the Ainahau tower side. Just look for the signs that show where there is an elevator. For most this may not be needed, but we had a stroller so we always needed it.The hotel lobby is always busy with people, the elevators do sometimes take a long time and get crowded, there is a lot of noise from outside at night time, and the rooms are dated. This all really wasn't a big deal since I know Waikiki and what to expect, especially if staying in that area. If that kind of stuff bothers you, then spend the extra money someplace like the Surfrider or Sheraton on the beach or just stay further away from the busy part of Waikiki or go to another island like Kauai or the Big Island.

Our room 318 had a wonderful view, not of the beach but who cares as we went there every day anyway but of all the action around the pool including night time entertainment on the stage.Room details: Quite spacious, and our extremely efficient housemaid kept our room/bathroom spotless.Plenty of towels, toiletries and bottles of water replenished each day.Our room was directly opposite the elevators but this didn't disturb us at all. (No-one can avoid noisy guests arriving back late at night which only happened once).Lots of storage spaceOur bed was extremely comfortable (although the pillows were too soft for us)The carpet in our room had just been cleaned prior to our arrival - niceThe room appeared to have been freshly painted recently. The large flat screen TV was also a bonus.Bathroom was small and needed upgrading but was functional for our needs.All in all a very comfortable room for the price. We are sad that the whole thing is to be demolished next year to be replaced most probably with something lacking the atmosphere of the PK and costing many more $$$. Go while you can.We've stayed over the road on the beach and really, the rooms there weren't much better as far as size and amenities go and a lot more expensive. I would ask for a pool view room though as rooms the other side of the passageway overlook the carpark etc.I recommend staying in the Princess wing, we haven't been in the others so can't comment",Ballarat Australia,"heatherm43</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ballarat Australia</strong>",15,4.0

True, PK is not such a modern facility as others in the area, but I have no major complaints about my stay. Our room was very clean and well maintained. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was a bit small but ok. Would have really liked some kind of counter by the sink to provide more room for my things.Street noise during the night was sometimes a bit noisy from vehicle and pedestrian traffic. But that has to be balanced against the convenient location of PK, in the center of Waikiki. AC unit was noisy sometimes and took getting used to. I did not have much problem sleeping, even with the noise. Easy strolling along Kaiulani Ave. Easy walk to Waikiki Beach across the street and either through the Moana Surfrider Hotel (no one there seemed to complain about our using it as a walkway to the beach), or through one of the street beach entrances a little further down.No complaint about the resort fee, like some other reviewers seem to have a problem with. It seemed to be reasonable and in line with other hotels. Not sure I understand the rationale for setting is as a separate fee; it didn't seem to be optional, so why not just incorporate it into the final room rate. As part of the resort fee, PK provided beach amenities: towels, folding beach chairs, and even one of those small plastic inflatable rafts to use on the beach.Staff was courteous and helpful. Especially one of the people at the tours table. He spent a lot of time arranging one-day tours to Maui and Big Island for 4 of us. He made a lot of phone calls to accommodate us. Shuttle bus picked us up at PK and brought us to the airport for travel to each island.Tried the breakfast buffet one morning; it was okay, nothing special. Although the woman working the omelet station that morning didn't seem to be in a particularly good mood. Guava juice was good; I now love that stuff!We rented a car.

It's right on the main drag of Kalakaua Avenue, but this particular corner at Kaiulani Avenue is surprisingly less frenetic than other parts of central Waikiki -- perhaps because there's not such a high concentration of restaurants and retail on this particular stretch. This property is definitely showing signs of wear, and some amenities seem a little improvised, like the oddly placed gym that sort of floats between a large terrace and a big open public area where large groups sometimes convene. The standard rooms are on the small side, but the ones on the higher floors of the tallest tower offer great views of the beach and mountains. I was upgraded to Room 2762, one of the hotel's suite accommodations, which was a very spacious open-plan room with a wet bar area in the large entryway; a big seating area with sofa, desk, armchair, and large flat-screen television atop a chest of drawers; a two-poster king bed; a bathroom separated from the rest of the room by a glass wall, good for showering while enjoying the view; and a very long double balcony that really brought the outdoors in when both sliding doors were flung open. This is by no means a luxury hotel, but my room was simply fantastic and, with the great location, made up for all shortcomings. TIP: The self parking is really convenient, especially if you are staying in the tallest Ainahau Tower, for there is direct elevator access from the top two levels of the parking structure to the rooms in this wing of the hotel.","New York City, New York","travelerhnl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",60,4.0

The hotel has arrangements with several travel agencies in Asia so, while I was there, I would estimate that 60% of the guests were from Asia.

For those who have health issues, Straub Medical Clinic is located on premises which should relieve you of any medical concerns you may have while visiting Waikiki. The food and entertainment in the hotel is top notch. Live Hawaiian music permeates throughout the lobby and restaurant during dinner hours. Later, I would recommend the hotel's Splash Bar. On two consecutive nights, while a guitarist was playing tunes, hotel guests and vendors did impromptu hulas. It was fantastic!

The room was--in a word--SHABBY. Old furnishings and stained carpet, cramped quarters, antiquated bath, and dirty lanai were our first impressions. After one night, I went to the front desk to inquire about an upgrade and was told there was nothing available. When I commented that we were surprised about the condition of the room, the staffer actually stated that I must remember this is a 50+ year old property and I should have booked a better room at the Sheraton Waikiki. My adult daughter, who was with me, could not believe the staff member would not even try to defend their own property. I did inquire at the Sheraton Waikiki if we could make a change there. The front desk clerk said he was hearing more of these types of complaints about the PK, but could not give us accommodations for our entire stay. So, we just decided to stay put and not have the conditions ruin an otherwise great vacation. The only recommendation I can make for this hotel is its location and lovely views of the Moana Hotel and ocean beyond.On the last day we were in Waikiki, we did spend a couple of hours checking out other properties and have found better accommodations at better prices elsewhere. If very basic lodging is all you require at a good location, try the Princess Kaiulani.

It has a lot of floors and rooms all built probably in the '70s or '80s. The place is very dated but I must compliment them on their recent renovation to their suites: you could hardly tell they are of that older vintage.Unlike the Surfrider, whose age is part of its beauty, the Kaiulani's birthdate is somewhat from a time when we made some of our ugliest and cheapest buildings. But the property is getting reinvestment and seems to have a cheery feel to it. Very tourista and just what a middle-class Hawaii vacationer should expect. It isn't five-star, nor does it pretend to be.The hotel has a cute little pool that is right off the lobby and feeds a steady flow of Mai Tais and other libations as the afternoons fade toward dusk. There is almost always some kind of Hawaiian-style entertainment going on at this point, and it all sort of blends together into buffet time as the sun sets.Buffets of a downtown Las Vegas level of quality are the standard here.

The location of this hotel is great as it is right across the street from the beach. The hotel room was adequate. It could be cleaned better. The top of the bed posts had a layer of dust. We had to move the dresser out as something fell behind it. There was a lot of dust and even a shirt behind the dresser. We upgraded to a pool side view because of the reviews I read on Trip Advisor. I was really glad we did as it was a nice view and quieter. The street side would have been way too noisy. The staff were friendly and helpful. My son and his wife received a basket of goodies in their room which was really nice. However since I was paying for both rooms it would have been nice if both of us had received a basket. lol The beds were all right, certainly not the quality of beds that I have slept on at other Sheraton's. The pillows were perfect. The room had a fridge in it and there are ABC stores close by to buy food. We did not eat at the hotel as the buffets were too expensive - approximately $40.00 each. I'm not sure if there was a menu or not - no one said anything so I assumed there was only the buffet. I find out now that there was a menu. There is a Denny's and an IHOP around the corner and down the street so I wasn't too worried about where to eat breakfast. There are internet connections in the rooms but no WiFi. However there is a huge area to sit in the lobby and use the WiFi. There was also a T.V. there and newspapers to read.

It did not even feel like a 4 or 5 star hotel. There was a sliding door on the bathroom, which was very hard to close. The toilet seat broke on us-they did replace it quickly. We had to call for our room to be cleaned-after we had given them about 8 hours to clean it. I have been in Sheraton's in other cities and was amazed by the luxury of those hotels. This hotel-no way Sheraton quality. We got a free breakfast. Unfortunately someone had to stay at the table and make sure the birds did not take your food off your plate.Only one time were we given covers for our plates. The pool closed very early-6pm. There was still 2 more hours of daylight! The water was cold-not heated at all. The patio chairs were so close together that you couldn't walk between them. The employees didn't know their own hotel or area-we asked where the gift shop was-they didn't know. We asked whre we could get something to eat-fast food---well there was a burger king, KFC and subway about a block away. The staff told us about a bar about 3 blocks away.

Recently, I spent two back-to-back weekends here with family visiting from the mainland. I think the best thing about the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani, is its location relative to other things in Waikiki, without the much higher price point of hotels right around it. Granted, you are not directly on the beach, so if that is what you are looking for, pay the extra $100+ per night to stay at the Moana Surfrider across the street. The PK is perfectly comfortable for a stay in Waikiki, short or a week, and you will undoubtedly save money from other properties. The hotel is in desperate need of a style renovation and upgrade. I was always waiting for Rose, Dorothy, Blance and Sophia to be waiting on the lanai for drinks. If you can overlook the sad carpet, and awful 70s color scheme, you will enjoy yourself. We had a deluxe oceanview room, which provides great views of the city and the Pacific. Bathrooms are SMALL, which is the case with most older city hotels. NEWSFLASH: Sheraton...it would cost you very little to install curved shower rods in the bathrooms, to give the illusion of more space in the shower, without any major construction.A big mahalo to Gregg and Ping at the front desk. Both were very firendly, and accomodating when we needed to be moved to alternate rooms because the room we were in, though the hotel advertises wi-fi, and charges you in their resort fee, didn't have wi-fi.

The P.K. has a more open feeling in the lobby and I think the staff is better than the S.W. It was easy for me to compare because I had stayed at the S.W. the last week of February and then at the P.K. two weeks later. I do think that the bathrooms at the P.K. needs some work - - our faucet leaked and we needed to put a towel behind the faucet to absorb the water.

We're a starwood member so we used points to book here. We shouldve paid cash for a room and saved our point. If you have an option stay at the Sheraton Waiki- much nicer. Much friendlier staff. Ironically it cost up us more to stay at the Sheraton Princess than the sheraton Waikiki. Unfortunately sheraton waikiki was sold out. If we go back were going to stay over by the Aulani- not at the Aulani but somewhere near it. Waikiki is a mess, traffic is so bad and beaches are crowded- its not a vacation if you have to stay down there. Sorry to be so negative, just got back from five days at the Sheraton Princess and everyday we went to the Aulani beaches to escape the Waikiki. Lastly i met a couple at the computer lab who had housekeeping enter their room at 8:30pm while they were sleeping- they thought someone was breaking in.",San Diego,"jassdsu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",20,1.0

We stayed there from 26 January 2013 for 7 nights. The hotel is in a great location central to everything. The reception area was spacious and the staff were very helpful and always polite.The pool area was good with plenty on lounge chairs and tables and chairs around so if you came back from shopping with takeaway you could sit around the pool area and eat and relax without having to go up to your room.The splash bar was great because you could get a snack or a main meal without having to wait an hour at some of the popular restaurants nearby.We had interconnecting rooms. The rooms lookec tired and were very clean and not very spacious as the furniture was bulky.The rooms definitely need to be refurbished. We stayed in level 27 in the tall tower that was beside the international market. When there was a band playing at a bar in the international market we could hear it and would be playing till very late at night.We had been to Waikiki 18 months previous and stayed at the Beachcomber Holiday Inn.Comparing the two. The Holiday in rooms were more spacious and modern compared to the Sheraton. However the Sheration had the nicer pool area, reception, guest lounge and you could even get buffet breakfast or dinner every night which the Holiday Inn doesn't have.We also hired a car on our stay and had free parking which a lot of the other hotels do not have.If we went back to Waikiki we would stay at the Sheraton over the Holiday Inn as It offered a lot more outside of your room.","Melbourne, Australia","Karen L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",5,4.0

I highly recommend that you get a pool view room. It is a bit noisy, but if you bring an electric white noise ""sound machine"" it is not noisy at all. There is beautiful Hawaiian music from young men singing with guitars starting at 6:30 p.m. until 10:30 p.m. at night and you can sit on your balcony, your ""lanai,"" and listen to the beautiful music. The musicians also have a ""hula girl"" with them performing the hula.The room is a bit basic, but it is nice and clean.The location is the best thing about the hotel. It is right in the middle of Waikiiki with many shopping areas and restaurants nearby. If you are on a tight budget, there is a Kentucky Fried Chicken across the street, and also an ABC Store across the street where you can purchase ""lunchables"" and sandwiches. There is also a Subway within walking distance.There IS an elevator to the parking garage, but only if you park on one of the top two floors.The breakfast buffet is wonderful.I highly recommend that you rent a car and drive to the North Shore of Oahu on your visit; the waves and the surfers are awesome! Also, rent a car and drive to the Pali Lookout-the view is terrific.I would give this hotel 5 out of 5 for everything. The staff are also wonderfully efficient and kind.From-Minnesota Girl","Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States","Ann R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States</strong>",5,5.0

We booked online and flew out that afternoon. The price was great considering we were on a high floor with ocean views towards Diamond Head however did not include breakfast which wasn't a drama as each morning we went to the ABC store, bought a yogurt and banana then walked across to Kona coffee and bought our cappuccino which was alot cheaper not to mention healthier! I do however remember the same furniture in the room from the first visit all those years ago!! The room was sufficient though a little small and decorations a little tired however clean and tidy and in an awesome location just across the road from the sand!

After a few painful weeks of sailing we ported in Pearl Harbor and i could not wait to jump on my mountain bike and see Oahu! I found eventually found myself wanting a place to sleep in downtown Waikiki. I thought it would be a small matter to pick a hotel and get a room. After something like 20 hotels with no vacancy i was getting a bit discouraged! After standing, most conspicuously, in line with my mountain bike in tow at the Sheraton Waikiki I was assisted by the most gorgeous of asian goddesses. She seemed sincerely dismayed in informing me that there was no vacancy. But hold on! She jumped on her phone and began to call every friend she had that also worked in hotel reception. She found a room for me at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani. I wish i could remember her name!About the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani... Absolutely worth the $150 room charge. The room was 4 star american standard. It was clean and functional with every modern amenity including free wifi. The rooms appear to have been last renovated in the early 90's however they have been kept spotless and functional. The bed was extremely comfortable but keep in mind that i just got off a bicycle seat and prior to that a navy bunk bed. The sheets where pure white and smelled sterilized clean. The shower was excellent with a modern shower head.The hotel offers a decent pool that is popular with the kids and those who want to chill out from the bustle of the beach.The famous Waikiki beach is merely across the main drag, Kalakaua Ave. So it is not right on the beach... fine! Those hotels start at 400/night so if adding 60 more steps to your journey is too taxing then by all means you need to be on the beach!!","Victoria, Canada","rdmev</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Canada</strong>",51,4.0

The hotel has a fantastic location very close to the beach. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodated us for an early check in when are son needed his nap. Our room is very clean and has a nice ocean view. The hotel is dated though but I imagine some would find it charming. The one major drawback is that some rooms don't have access to wifi though it is included in the resort fee. This was fairly annoying for us since we are in one of those rooms. I would suggest you are told this at check in to at least avoid the frustration of trying to log-in. All in all I would recommend this place as long as you don't absolutely need Internet access in your room.,"Seattle, Washington","Jason H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",3,3.0

I will preface this review by saying that we stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki which was a different level of hotel...and we were spoiled by the accommodations there. We moved after one day to the Princess to save some money and because the Waikiki was sold out, and having seen some reviews, we were ready for the property to be a slight step down, and in some areas it was. The location is really great, blocks from a main tour pickup and drop off point, the beach is a short walk, and there are tons of restaurants and name brand and boutique stores. The lobby, while dated, was clean (and very busy with arrivals and departures). We did not use the restaurant or bar except for a welcome drink when we walked in, but both were also clean and appeared well staffed. The pool area was nice, and oddly enough there was never anyone swimming, just sun bathing. We checked in after 3 because the room was not ready when we first arrived in the morning, but I understood this as the hotel was full the night before and checkout is at 11 am, so I was unfazed by it. Our check in was made warm and friendly by Kathy, who was great and made up feel welcome. Getting to our room in the tower, it was again clean, but also dated. The view from the 26th floor, however, was amazing! The ups and downs were unfortunately a recurring theme with this hotel. A really nice touch was the fresh flower arrangement that was provided for us as a honeymoon gift. Then 10 minutes later, a complimentary bottle of champagne was sent up. Awesome! Up again! Then the downer came at 11 pm when we could hear a performing band from across the street. The sound echoed through the natural canyon formed by the tall buildings. Not the hotel's fault, but my wife simply couldn't sleep. In the morning we asked to move to a different room, and once again, Kathy came to the rescue! Luckily, she was able to find us a room in the much-newer feeling wing in the building by the pool. No noise, fresher room, and the views were actually just as nice! lastly, the housekeepers were very friendly, making eye contact and saying hello very day we saw them.We continued on with our week of beach, swimming, shopping and touring, and had no more problems. So while the Sheraton Princess could use a facelift, it was truly the face of the caring staff, and Kathy in particular, that made our stay great and just as importantly would entice us to return. Didn't love the resort fee, but we tried to get our money's worth out of it by getting beach chairs and towels, and using the internet which was wireless in the 2nd room we moved to. Also, become an SPG member if you have a moment. This gets you points, upgrades, and other bonuses like discounts at local restaurants applied at check out.","Orlando, Florida","Bookend2505</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",1,4.0

This trip I travelled with my mother (3rd visit to PK) and my 3 year old daughter. Upon arrival at 8am we were made to wait till 3pm for a room after flying from Sydney, Australia. The hotel was not full, but that was too bad. In the meantime we had lunch by the pool and was served a stale club sandwich with black avocado (not fresh). We returned the sandwich and gave lunch a miss. By the time 3pm, we were very tired and checked into our standard room which was tiny, original bathroom (very old) with a view of the carpark and down below dumpster bins. By this stage I was starting to feel like we were anywhere but Hawaii. My mother complained to the bell boy about the room. About an hour later the hotel sent up a fresh basket of fruit apologising for the room. Only to open the fresh basket of fruit and discover the fruit to be green and mouldy. I went downstairs to the reception to thanked them for the fresh fruit, but in Australia the Sheraton is of a high standard and when we give fresh fruit, it isn't covered in mould and that they were welcome to eat the fruit themselves. With that we were upgraded immediately to the Ocean Deluxe Room which was a nicer & bigger room with a lovely view of Waikiki Beach and I started to feel like I had in fact arrived in Hawaii - finally. The only further problem was that the room stunk of ""MOULD"". This hotel is old and is in need of renovations with all bathrooms. The service is a little slow. My mother was very disappointed with her 3rd visit to PK and won't be returning next year. Such a shame to have a regular visitor have such a disappointing experience. Other than the hotel, our trip to Hawaii was lovely. The Waikele Outlet is a shopping heaven. Travel with PJ Plover, they have coach's pick up and drop off from Dukes Statue on Waikee Beach for $10 return. Pearl Harbour was interesting. Alo Moana Shopping Centre was over rated. Once you have been to the outlets, further shopping isn't necessary. The outlet covers everything. The Ross Store has great/cheap clothing for children. Will definately return to Hawaii again for a shopping holiday, other than that, there isn't much to do in Hawaii. The beach is lovely, but it's a long way to travel for a beach when Australia's beaches are just as nice.",,KJJJB,48,3.0
