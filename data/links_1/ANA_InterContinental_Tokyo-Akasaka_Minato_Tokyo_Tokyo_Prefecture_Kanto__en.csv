Its location makes this a good choice for those on business. It has its own subway entrance -- Tameike -- on the Ginza-sen subway line, for fast access to all subways.The hotel is located in the Ark Hills complex of Akasaka/Roppongi, and that includes the beautiful Suntory Hall concert hall; and restaurants on two floors in the neighboring Ark Mori building. The level of service at the hotel is five-star elegant. This is professional hotel management at its highest level. As a result, the hotel is also a popular choice for Japanese weddings: it's a remarkable insight into the culture to watch a young couple in full western wedding attire descend the lighted stairway to the main lobby, to be greeted by family and friends tossing lotus flowers in their path! Dining (and drinking) in the hotel are VERY pricey....drinks in the cocktail bar on the 38th floor (which provides a view of Mt Fuji far in the distance on clear days) averaged over 2,500 [over $20 bucks USD] a pop. The buffet breakfast price was over 3,500 yen a person [over $30 bucks]. But not to worry: there are marvelous French pastry shops nearby -- one in the hotel's lobby or on the plaza of Suntory Hall.We loved the service, the cleanliness and the convenience of this hotel, which maintains super-high standards.

The hotels infrastructure is falling apart, our room smelled mainly in the bathroom it smelled like sewage pipe burst.

This is completely absurd if you provide a service that customers pay for you need to provide the full information. I escalated this issue to Sumumu the duty manager he said would give us a refund for our entire stay, I checked my email he lied and credit only one night. As I called back and said there’s a mistake you said you would refund the entire stay, he kept saying it was not possible even though he already promised we would refund the entire stay.

I just arrived Tokyo having stayed at a hotel at the competing hotel chain in Osaka right before my arrival in Tokyo. It is a difficult review to write, to be honest. There are so many things that the hotel does well, and not, it would be unfair to describe the hotel using one single score.Let’s start with what the hotel does not do well.1. I called the hotel before I made my reservation to find out if my reservation, using points, would include breakfast. The answer I got was “yes”. Then when I arrived, I was told, “you are not getting breakfast since you are using points to pay for your room”. Maybe it has to do with IHG, elite members of the competing chain always get free breakfast. Anyway, the answer I got was astounding. The front desk person saw my disappointment and gave me complimentary breakfast anyway, but this was not what I expected after having called the hotel before my arrival;2. I asked if I could get a complimentary rollaway bed for my 4 year old before my arrival. I could have gotten no as an answer but again I was told yes. Then, nothing happened;3. I booked the room for 3 people, but I was given 2 sets of towels, tooth brushes, slippers... what happens to attention to details that is what Japanese people are well known for?4. This is my second stay at the hotel. The first time was in late 2010. They had minor remodeling since my last visit, but things remain dated from a cosmetic perspective. The hotel still looks like it belongs to the mid-80’s;5. Bedroom has no USB port... none! it says so much about what kind of customers it targets;6. It is a big hotel, and staff is always busy. However, for a brand like InterContinental, staff should not let customers be aware that they are being rushed. It is clear that the staff is busy all the time, and sometimes, maybe because of lack of time, I was brushed off. It wasn't one time when I was brushed off. If I didn't know better, I could have interpreted it as arrogance.Now let’s talk about things that it does well.1. Location - right next to Taimeke-sanno station;2. If you look at their bathroom, it tells so much about how they keep up with their maintenance. Although the bathroom looks like one that came from the 80’s, everything looks new (meaning very little wear and tear);3. “Some” of the hotel staff was great.It is my first time visiting an InterContinental as a Spire Elite member, and I feel quite strongly that the IHG loyalty program is not as strong as the other loyalty program I am also a part of. From the benefits that I am getting to the way I am treated at the hotel properties, I feel that IHG is not so much into keeping their customers staying within the chain. The hotel can do much better with the way they handle customer requests. When yes means no, it can only lead to customer dissatisfaction.This should really be a 3.5 star review.","Honolulu, Hawaii","ononlam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",12,4.0

The rooms are so tired and run down that you never relax in your room. I stayed on a business trip with about 10 other people. I was shocked to discover on the 3rd day that some people had even worse rooms than mine. My room was old and stale, but it was at least spacious. Other colleagues on the trip said they barely had enough space to maneuver around the bed. I find that most hotels in Japan have great bathrooms. The bathroom at ANA Intercontinental must be 15-20 years old, and has a strange glass window with blinds separating it from the bedroom. I returned to my room once in the middle of the day to find the housekeeper cleaning. She was working so hard, and I could tell she took a lot of pride in her work. I was kind of shocked, because the room felt rather dirty. I realized it wasn't because the housekeeping staff are neglecting their duties, it's because the rooms have gone far too long without any investment. Similarly, I felt bad for the front desk team. They seem to spend all day dealing with complaints. The front desk was constantly mobbed with guests begging to move to a different room. I understand there are a handful of renovated rooms that are less grim.The hotel has a wide range of food and beverage options, and the food and drinks that I had were good.

The great part was that the concerie was very good, they gave great directions and guidiance during our stay. We only have two disapointments for the hotel. 13% Service ChargeI was told well before going to Japan that it is a dishonor to tip people in Japan that it is a Taboo. Tipping in Japan without a good reason, or doing it the wrong way, could come across as crass or rude and there are only a few times when a tip might be appropriate. Although tipping is sometimes acceptable in upscale Western hotels, most of the hotel staff that you encounter are trained to politely refuse tips and tokens of gratuity. But this hotel’s restaurants they take it to a new level. At this hotel there was a 13% Service charge added to the bill and a 8% Sales Tax. When you are paying higher prices as it is I do not want to see a MANDATORY Service Charge, 3450 YEN (US$34.50) for the buffet $10 for an orange juice then they add 13% for not doing anything.  The Swimming PoolWhen you visit a hotel you expect to pay more for Spa services but not to use the outdoor unheated swimming pool . This Hotel attacks you. At 4000 YEN per day per person (US $40) it would have cost us $640 in pool fees for our 8 day stay at the hotel. Room rates do not drop below $200 ever. But then ask $80 per couple per day to take a 20 min dip in the pool! When we visited the pool we were not impressed at all. The entire place is set up to promote drinking Mumm Champagne and swimming. I do not think drinking and swimming mix well (drownings happen fast when drunk). Most of the swimmers were kids under the age of 14. They are targeting minors to drink. BAD MARKETING. While there we saw 4 lifeguards, if you can call them that , standing around check out the tan each other had and seeing who had a better tan line. They were chatting with a couple of girls with their backs to the pool. These four were NOT doing their job. In 5 seconds a kid could be drowning and they would NOT have any idea that it happened. It would be better off that they were not there and a sign read “NO LIFEGUARD ON DUTY” because that is what was going on, at least they would know they were the primary watcher. What was these peoples 4000 YEN going for?The Front desk is way understaffed. Only one person was on the desk and one person telling you to wait in line? Why? Get more people behind the desk. There are how many rooms in this place?

Upon check-in we were offered champagne in the champagne bar which was most welcomed following the flight from London. The location is very good with the Tokyo metro directly next to the hotel and there are always taxis outside the hotel. Breakfast was delicious and there is a great range of options for guests. The staff are most friendly, we were very grateful to the concierge team for all their help throughout the stay. As well as this the team in the lobby dining were brilliant - there was one lady who gave great advice regarding Kyoto for which we were grateful. Staff at this property take time to take an interest in your visit to Japan. The bell captain was very helpful in having our suitcases sent to Kyoto which saved us having to take them on the train - this was something we went into use in Osaka and when we travelled back to Tokyo. We could not have asked for a better room. Unrivalled view of Tokyo tower to wake up to for four days was great. The only downside is the fee to use their outside swimming pool. I would have thought that if there had to be a fee it was have been considerably reduced for guests compared to what the hotel currently offers. If staying in Tokyo again I would consider this hotel and recommend to anyone. Overall a 5/5 for the hotel experience but the outdoor pool fee was somewhat disappointing. If it was not for the swimming pool I would give this a 5 as everything else was perfect.

This is let down for me at least by a few things. Some easy to fix, some not so easy.My room was very small, normal for Tokyo maybe but for me, very small. The toilet for example has a half width door that misses the toilet by millimetres on opening and a only had a half sized bath. The decor is dated and a little shabby and in my case, although a non smoking room, stank of stale cigarettes, the carpet too was stained and in generally poor condition. One complimentary bottle of water is provided, with more available in the mini bar at £5 for 500ml.... not acceptable in my opinion. The last ‘equivalent’ hotels I stayed in the last two months provided multiple free bottled water. (Sofitel Sentosa Singapore, Wanda Reign Shanghai). The hotel has reasonable facilities, a free 24h gym (gets quite busy), a sauna and a 20m outdoor pool (£30 a time though, even for guests) so understandably empty. This by the way is the ONLY outside space in the hotel, so if you want to sit outside and read a The water thing and £30 for the pool is a bit of a rip off in my view. Small rooms I get, Tokyo isn’t a big place but for nearly £250 a night I’m not prepared to put up with dated, shabby decor, carpets and a smoky room.

Floors in the lift are accessed by the use of your room key. The rooms were a good size and even though my room was close to the elevator you didn’t suffer from the usual noise. There was a good amount of storage and a large bathroom with in bath shower. The bathroom was a little dated particularly the shower but it worked fine. You received a fantastic range of toiletries just in case you forgot anything and a well stocked mini bar. My room overlooked the swimming pool. Breakfast was daily on the 2nd floor at the main restaurant. There was a good selection of fruit, cereals and cooked options which ranged from local Japanese breakfasts and your more American style pancakes, crispy bacon and waffles. There was also a good range of pastries. They also made a great pot of coffee! Checkin and check out were speedy and efficient.

On arrival after a long flight and transfer via the limousine bus we found the entrance unattended by any staff, there were no bell staff to assist with luggage. The bus drops passengers at the level below the lobby where the reception is located so you need to navigate a large lower level, find the elevators and take your luggage upstairs yourself. This was contrasted with the hotel the bus stopped at before we arrived at the Intercontinental. At that hotel, there were multiple bell staff waiting to greet the bus and passengers with trolleys for the luggage and a friendly greeting. I was quite surprised that Intercontinental didn't have even 1 staff member available. I expressed my disappointment about this on checkin, but the staff member didn't seem to be concerned about this, there was certainly no apology given. As I had a Club Intercontinental room I should have been directed to the club for checkin, however I was kept standing at the main reception for checkin. Again, after a long flight I would have preferred to go straight to the club.The 'other' hotel, the club experience was excellent. The staff are exceptionally warm and helpful, taking time to chat to guests and provide assistance, information and tips about Tokyo. Breakfast was exception with 3 or was it 4 seperate menus. I had the breakfast from the french restaurant which was very innovative, along with a traditional western breakfast. Afternoon tea and evening canapés were available, but unfortunately they didn't vary from day to day. The room was newly refurbished and very comfortable. Blackout blinds ensured a restful sleep, and the room was very quiet. There were very limited English speaking channels on TV and I was disappointed that there were no pay to view movies available. I used the gym one morning, but after that preferred to walk around the local area in the morning.

As IHG ambassador member I was expecting a lot of this property. I have requested the price to take the club intercontinental to the reservation of the hotel they ask me to pay 200€ extra per night and per room for that witch is the exact amount difference between the rate paid and the club room rate. Usually I get 20% discount with my membership status. When we arrived my room was beautiful but the bathroom was too small and they are not doing turndown at night. The sofa of my friend’s room was stained and burned by cigarette and the room furnishings were horrible. After complaining about the second room the first response were « we are aware of the rooms in poor conditions » but they continue to sell it, it was taking two nights of our 4 nights stay for my friend to change room. The second thing is that avoid to go to the cascade restaurant just to have coffee, they charged us 3250¥ for two coffees it’s unacceptable for just American coffee. Then we wanted to book a sukiyaki restaurant we had the name of the restaurant and ask the concierge to book it. Even with a simple restaurant booking we had an issue again they book a different restaurant.The only goods points were the bars of the hotel the Mixx bar on 36th floor with beautiful views is amazing, the champagne bar on lobby floor with very professional and kind staff and to finish the Da Vinci bar and cigar lounge to have a good after-dinner cocktail.In my opinion it will be better for you to avoid this property which is not up to the intercontinental standard.

I was also very disappointed to learn that they had assigned me a room with two twin beds, regardless of the fact that I had stated that there would be three room occupants when I made the reservation. Where did they expect my 18-year old son to sleep? On the floor? Well, in order to avoid this mishap, they made me shell out an additional $100 for a rollaway bed.

The staff at the Club lounge are nice and helpful too. However, the horrible check-in experience and poor housekeeping marred our entire stay. As a Platinum member I had thought that we could get an early check in but we had to wait till 6 pm as the previous guest checked out late. This ruined our plans for the day. We were not offered a complimentary upgrade. In fact, nothing was offered. It wasn't until we voiced our displeasure that we were finally given an extended check out and token points. This is in stark contrast to the Intercontinental Osaka where we were given an upgrade without asking, a welcome fruit basket, a bottle of wine and a personalised note from the GM.Housekeeping too was a disappointment. I noticed fluff from our clothing lying on the carpet after the room was cleaned and the next day I placed a small piece of tissue on the carpet as a test. When we returned in the evening, the tissue was still on the carpet.Platinum members - you'll probably get better value with a regular room.","Singapore, Singapore","Myangz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",13,3.0

Location is good, it’s the Tamieke-Sanno stop on the Ginza line, making it easy to get around. The hotel does not have laundry service but there is a laundromat across the street.

At least 2-3 times the size of lounges of other 5-star hotels. Secondly, the STAFF are extremely friendly and take service to the next level. Staff such as Narita (i hope i got his name right - he said it was spelt the same as the airport) made the experience in the lounge so much more pleasurable. The lounge team was collectively impressive and service standards were consistently high. Kudos to the team and their manager. Thirdly, the FOOD is amazing. The lounge has 3 meal services spread throughout the day: breakfast, high tea for the afternoon and tapas/cocktails for the evening. Breakfast is served ala carte (not buffet style) in the lounge and patrons have the option of selecting the breakfast set from the in-house 2-michelin star restaurant Pierre Gagnaire at no additional cost. If you tend to sleep in or wake up late, don't worry because breakfast ends at 11am. Afternoon service (2-4pm) is high tea and the selection is very respectable. Evening service (5.30-7.30pm) serves free-flow cocktails and also tapas from Asian or Western menu.

Despite this, when we showed up they put us in a room with twin beds, despite the booking being for 1 king bed. There was a gap between the bed and the wall as well so it was impossible to shield the baby from accidentally falling over in his sleep. After bringing this to the attention of the staff, they simply replied with the standard ""Sorry Sir, there is no other room avaiable.""2. The sofa in the room was dirty with visible stains on it! Anyone who has been around a child knows that they tend to try to standing by holding sofas, beds, and other fixed structures and in the process end up licking whatever they're holding. Clearly we expected cleanliness to a standard higher than this given this property boasts about being a premier property. Who knows what those stains were.3. Due to the inconvenience I was told the next day I would be upgraded to a King Suite. Of course when they moved me to another room it was a standard king room (which I didn't mind) but why make empty promises when you have no intention on fulfilling them?!

The bathroom is very dated but it's still a very nice hotel.It has very nice facilities and restaurants. Here are the negatives. This place is obviously mainly for international guests and it's very obvious. It's very true that ihg platinum elite particurly get nothing at this place which is of no fault of the staff or the managers since these policies are set in place by the higher ups. Service was amazing and the tower of macraroons was super cool! So I don't really understand the poor reviews based on the amount of free stuff which you werent supposed to get? The gym is very nice but there is no squat rack or real pull up bar. Here is the negative part of staying at a hotel aimed towards foreigners in Japan. Some of the guests have strange gym behavior. I don't know why. Placing towels everywhere after use for no reason? Someone told me there saving a machine. He wasn't anywhere near the machine for a good 15 mins. Racking weights out of order. Other weird strange behaviors. I agree with the other reviews on corporate alpha males haha. Overall the experience was actually quite nice. Wish the lights were brighter in the rooms. I stayed at regular twin room. It wasn't horrible.However I have to tell you, I specifically choose to stay at three different hotels this week to help me know which brand treats me the best. Hilton treats you the best. Marriot was second, and ihg benefits were the lowest with particularly no benefits even at higher levels. The prince hotels blows people out of the water.

Opened in 1986, the tower is part of the Ark Hills complex in the Minato ward, and is just around the corner from the US Embassy. One of the many entrances to the Tameike-Sanno metro station is conveniently located directly adjacent to the hotel, although it is a good five-minute walk underground until the gate line is reached. Presumably as it was approaching midnight, there were no bellboys outside the lobby, so we headed inside to the reception desk where we were met with a warm welcome by a fairly new member of staff; check-in lacked the usual polish for this reason but was well-intentioned. As everybody has to start somewhere, these things are easy to forgive. As a Platinum IHG member, I was offered a choice of a welcome drink or points; as usual I took the points as the welcome drink is somewhat pointless with Club access included in the rate. We weren’t offered any help with our bags, which again I put down to the new member of staff on the desk; I actually usually decline help anyway as there’s nothing worse than having to wait for them to be delivered to the room, particularly at a late hour.Thanks to my Ambassador status, we had been upgraded before arrival two categories from a Club InterContinental room to a Kaze InterContinental Club Corner Suite. Whilst the majority of the public areas around the lobby and non-Club rooms are looking somewhat dated, Club floors have been extensively and elegantly refurbished and are decidedly swish; it’s essentially a different hotel entirely on the upper floors. As we stepped through the door to our suite on the 33rd floor, the telephone rang; reception had forgotten to give us our pre-ordered (through the hotel concierge) Shinkansen bullet train tickets, and they were sending them up now. Once these arrived I was able to look around the suite a little more. The suite itself was comprised of two principal rooms; the living room was spacious, with a large three-seater sofa, armchair and dining table with two chairs. Oddly there was no desk in the suite; instead, what appeared to be a side table housed one of several telephones and various other items more suited to a desk. The dining table was home to the Ambassador welcome fruit plate, and several welcome gifts of varying levels of interest and taste. The savoury snacks were replaced daily. To the right of the entryway, a walk-in closet provided a useful place to hide everything that is often unsightly in a hotel room, although the space could’ve benefited from better lighting and a mirror. The safe was also located in there. Backing onto the closet was the stylish tea, coffee and minibar station, which included a Nespresso machine. I always think it looks a bit stingy when only one bag of each tea (TWG in this case) is available in a room clearly intended for two people. Walls throughout the suite were exquisitely panelled or covered in subtle wallpaper, accented with art, whilst the floor was a sumptuous patterned carpet. The thoughtfully designed mood lighting and window coverings were controlled via switches, and of course there were plenty of power and USB sockets in all the right locations. The bedroom had an armchair and side table positioned adjacent to the angled window, with a small wardrobe housing robes and kimonos adjacent to the glass-panelled bathroom. Whether intended or not, although there was space for a sound bar below the TV in the bedroom, unlike in the living room there was no sound bar here. Both TVs stayed on their previous channel when switched back on; a minor point, but incredibly handy and frustration-avoiding and one which more hotels should follow. Whilst there was no complimentary Ambassador mineral water anywhere to be found, the normal branded IC bottled water was available and regularly replaced. Through a rather heavy self-closing door, the bathroom was spacious and beautifully designed. As is common with most Japanese hotels, the shower and bath were located within the same mini wet-room, the concept being that one should shower before a bath to ensure cleanliness. Whilst I can definitely get on board with this in theory, the proximity of the shower to the bath means that in reality the bath gets dirty from the shower somewhat defeating the point, as well as being unnecessarily complicated to clean. Amenities were by Salvatore Ferragamo, a nice change from the more usual Agraria products used in non-suites. The separate toilet room featured a bidet toilet; not technically a washlet, since it was a Lixil rather than a Toto, although I can assure you that the effect was the same. This mini room, more a cubicle, was on the small side and would’ve benefited from at least a shelf to improve its practicality.After a comfortable night’s sleep on a typically Japanese supportive but snug bed, breakfast was sought in the 35th floor Club InterContinental lounge, but not before taking a moment to admire the view from our suite. The lounge is arranged with a seating area directly behind reception and dining area in a long thin space to the right. The seating area offers numerous different options for relaxation, including a small library, but doesn’t immediately appear to be particularly well coordinated design-wise. ‘Cosy’ is not a word I’d use to describe this lounge what with its open layout and multiple mirrored or reflective wall surfaces, but it’s certainly not an uncomfortable or uninteresting space, particularly with its expansive views of the city from three aspects. The dining area is the nicest part of the lounge, with well-spaced elegantly-laid tables (many positioned to take advantage of the view) and two sumptuous buffets decorated with fresh flowers. For a club lounge, the à la carte menu is notably extensive, and includes a menu from Pierre Gagnaire, representing what is the only two Michelin star breakfast available in a hotel club lounge anywhere in the world. The breakfast waiting team were always professional and usually efficient and were happy to take customised orders. I enjoyed the Pierre Gagnaire breakfast one morning (which incidentally was not available on the Saturday morning); on other days I enjoyed a selection of other à la carte options. Everything was of excellent quality, although I’m in no rush to demand all my breakfasts in future are made to Michelin star standards. We enjoyed afternoon tea in the lounge on a couple of occasions, although unlike in say the Singapore Club InterContinental, I actively had to seek out a member of staff for service when seated in the lounge area (as opposed to at one of the tables), and drinks were generally not poured at the table. Afternoon tea is entirely waiter-led, something I’m not a huge fan of as I’m more at ease just helping myself to a few items rather than being presented with an entire array of things I may or may not like (although admittedly the latter is usually better presented).My schedule only permitted one sampling of the evening canapés; this was yet another nicely presented buffet offering an excellent selection of both Japanese and Western items. Drinks were made to order at the tended bar (which doubles as the second buffet at breakfast time), and a daily rotating menu of hot canapés was offered table-side. I popped down to check out the gym and outdoor swimming pool that same evening; the gym looked nice enough, but the pool area was rather austere with 1980s tiling in abundance. I also looked around the ballroom and conference area one morning, which was decorated in much the same way as the lobby.When it came to check-out, the lounge team took care of all formalities and offered help with bags and onward travel. Although I might be tempted to try one of the other IC properties on my next visit to Tokyo, the ANA offered a great suite and solid lounge experience, with the added novelty factor of a two Michelin star lounge breakfast. With some further investment in refurbishing the non-Club floors, and perhaps some slightly more proactive service in the lounge, this would have been an even better stay.","London, United Kingdom","James G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",78,4.0

I think it was $35 or $60 per person (per day!) to access the pool. Granted, you got some alcohol or something with it- but families with young kids were not best served by this policy and for a family of 5, that is a ridiculous price. I think the intention was to prevent over crowding at the pool and it worked!The rooms were clean and well appointed- I loved the Toto toilets (which are standard in Japan, I guess). The bathrooms were rather small though, as in, a larger person might have to enter sideways and the toilet was practically in the tub- no lie.The breakfast buffet was great! It had every thing you might need from American to English to traditional Japanese to Chinese breakfast. A+++The staff were attentive yet unobtrusive and the concierge was extremely helpful in helping us chart our course via train each day. This hotel is almost on top of the train station and is central to most of the interesting spots in Tokyo. Don’t look for anything other than a cityscape view though- it is in the middle of a concrete jungle. The bar/lounge in the 32nd (?) floor was a nice touch if you didn’t feel like leaving the hotel.

Our room had a great view of Tokyo tower - so we didn’t bother with going to other viewing decks to see it. We got to see it day and night every single day. Instead we opted to see Tokyo views from skytree. Rooms very clean and beds comfortable. The room size is very spacious by Tokyo standards. The breakfast buffet is amazing; we ordered room service to bring it up. Fresh and very tasty. Prices are what you expect for a 5* in Tokyo. Concierge and receptions always very helpful. Location wise; it’s close and walkable distance to a few lines. No more than 5 mins. The subway leading there is directly outside the hotel. This is a nicer / business part of town. Away from all the hustle and bustle of shinjuku. The rooftop pool is amazing ! Stunning views of the city . ,,swesnab,2,5.0

There are so many things I love about this hotel - it’s very reasonable considering it’s Tokyo, the property is in a great location (close to many restaurants, stores, easy access to the airports, etc.), the rooms are clean and the service is top notch. The two major downsides - in my opinion - are: they won’t guarantee you a non-smoking room (no matter how hard you try) and some of the rooms haven’t been renovated in a long time. There are also a few other odd quirks as well, e.g. they charge you to use the pool. I got upgraded to the club level room given my status, which has the newest rooms. They are VERY NICE and are an absolute steal for the corporate rate I was paying. The bathrooms are very small but I didn’t mind at all given the price I was paying (in particular, I almost had no room to sit on the toilet...take a look at the picture...it was a bit ridiculous). In the end, this property will continue to my choice when visiting Tokyo!","New York City, New York","legacytraveler1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",90,4.0

The reason I haven’t given the hotel a five star review is solely because of the problems we had at check in. As Club Intercontinental Ambassadors we were due a room upgrade to a suite. When we checked in we were not given this upgrade and only realised on getting to the room. We therefore had to go back to reception. The error was acknowledged but we were told no suites of this class were available as the hotel was busy. We said this wasn’t acceptable so we went to the club lounge while they tried to sort something out. In total it probably took about an hour and a half to sort out and we were quite tired from our flight. The best they could offer us was to move to a suite after two nights and some points. This was frustrating and inconvenient. However, this aside, we really liked the hotel. The club lounge staff were excellent and the food in the Club Lounge, including breakfast, was very good. Afternoon tea (table service) was served 2-4pm in the Club Lounge. Evening drinks from 5.30pm until 7.30pm which included champagne. The pool was nice but quite busy when we went. Our rooms were very nice. The Club Lounge staff arranged for our luggage to be forwarded to Kyoto. We also arranged a private airport pick up which was very efficient. Not the best start to the stay, but nonetheless we would consider staying again as the hotel was excellent on the whole.

As central as you can get and just a few steps from the Tameiko-Sanno / Kokkai-Gijidomae Metro Station with Chidoya, Marunouchi, Ginza and Namboku Lines.- The hotel itself very much your ordinary business hotel, albeit with a rather antiquated architecture and decor. Not tastefully old. Just outdated, characterised by low ceilings, overall dark tones throughout the building, dim lights, smelly corridors and baths, and odd bits of broken/worn out furniture. While our room (Double on 12F) was quite large for Tokyo scale, it suffered from nearly all the problems. With poor ventilation, dirty carpet, and a broken nightstand. Not horrible, but also not what you expect from a 5 star establishment. - The hospitality side could also use a step up. While the staff were generally friendly and professional, they also felt somewhat cold and stiff. Cleaners for instance would not return our greetings and instead walks away. Once again, not terrible, but also not as refined as you might find in other hotels.- - - ¥4000 pool charge during summer months (7000 for visitors). In all my time travelling around, I’ve never come across a hotel, and a 5 star nonetheless, that charges guests for pool use. I’ve stayed in quite a few hotels, from 2 stars shacks to Four Seasons, but this level of lecherous capitalism is a first.Conclusion:  + An affordable 5 star hotel in great central location. - Makes you question whether it truly deserves those 5 stars with its outdated hardware and questionable business model.",,billytxchen,2,2.0

No smoking is allowed at lobby. It took me a while to figure out the reason. The air from the top floor bar (or cigar lounge) are channeled via elevators.

The state of the room wasn’t optimal as well, it feels old and not very clean. The rug and bathroom were particularly dirty in our room. The pool area.

The good thing was that it was a hot day outside so we swam that coldness away fast enough but still the dirtiness was disappointing.

It’s grand and beautiful, the rooms are spacious and it’s feels like how a 4-5 star hotel should feel. I would try the steak sandwich in the restaurant on level 2. Amazing and best I’ve had.From a location perspective, Tokyo is a very spread out city. At the surface this place seems far removed from the action, but if you get to understand and use the trains, nite there is a station underground from the hotel that takes you to Ginza in a couple of stops where you’ll find all the high end “western” fashion. Then about a ten minute uphill walk into Roppongi is where you’ll find loads of nightlife and little places to eat. Not sure I would stay there again because I was more interested in seeing Akihabara (gaming district) and then Shinjuku is a MUST - feels like what a tourist wants to see in Tokyo and to get to those I ended up in taxis because I couldn’t figure out which line to change at the stations.

One of the best luxury city hotels we have stayed in! I have selected some photographs which I have taken to supplement this quick review. Service:Top notch service especially from Club associates whom we corresponded daily. Many thanks to Ms Yuka from Guest Relations and Ms Ai who sorted out efficiently the room non-upgrades issue I had faced as a Ambassador member upon checking in. We were constantly checked upon on our overall satisfaction with the stay, and in fact we did! Rooms:The renovated club rooms, even for the standard club rooms, are gorgeously appointed. Room space, which seemed to be a rare commodity in Tokyo, was large. Luxurious amenities such as the Ferragamo toiletries were provided. Beds were comfortable and with the memory foam pillows on request, the sleep quality was amazing and we couldn't hear any noise from outside the room.Views from the Room:First night was spent in the basic club room which provided the jawdropping view of the Tokyo tower especially when it is illuminated at night.Second night was spent in a newly renovated junior suite from which we could see Mt Fuji amongst the skyscapers on a clear morning.Club:The best club lounge we have ever experienced in terms of luxury, space, service and food quality. Of particular mention is the Club Breakfast. It offers a wide spread which you could order alacarte, either the Asian spreads or the Pierre Gagnaire breakfast. Of note were the fruits from the buffet spread are of amazing quality (which very few hotels even sadly bother to offer high quality fruits in their breakfast spread).Due to the large space provided in the lounge, it never felt crowded and also because the hotel tightly controls the access to the club floor.Service from the club associates were 5 stars!! Thanks to Romaine, Bernadette, Ms Kim, Ms Ai and many others who made this stay amazing. Summary:In all, if you want to enjoy your stay in this luxury hotel, pay for the renovated club rooms with the club floor access. If there was a point of consideration in this perfect stay, perhaps the management should relook at providing more competitive room rates, aligned with the prices of the club floors of similar luxury hotels in Tokyo.

This hotel was the worst from all of the hotel I stayed during my trip. Even though you have a Platinum Ambassador, it means nothing when you stay at this hotel. The reason I chose this hotel is due to the location that was closer to the subway station and near major attraction. I was wrong. Even though it was near subway station but it was located at the last exit (Exit 13) once you got out from the train. I bring my mom with me who could not walk so much. To get here, you had to walk so far and lots of stairs. At the end, we used Taxi instead to go to Roponggi (at the same time, to eat at ippudo and ichiran) and take subway from there. Before my arrival, I sent an email request regarding the reservation and the staff, Goro Takechi, replied everything promptly and fast. However, the services were not as good as SPG or Marriott hotels in Japan even though you are a Platinum Ambassador status. I requested for an upgrade during my visit if it was not sold out and I preferred a double bed as I stayed with my Mom to celebrate my birthday. However, he offered me two choices: my original booking (classic two twin bed room) or executive deluxe room (king bed - the next level category room). He mentioned that there was no longer a room with two twin bed room. I thought that even though if I did not ask for upgrade, as a Platinum Ambassador, I should get an automatic upgrade to the next level category room which is the executive deluxe room. I replied him that it was okay to keep my original booking as I preferred two twin bed room. When I checked my reservation again, instead of two people, the reservation changed to 3 people with an extra charge for the 3rd person. I sent him an email regarding the issue and also, told him how disappointing I was as a Platinum Ambassador member and wish I could cancel my booking and stay at other properties. However, I did not have much time left to book at other properties. He then replied that he fixed the charges and upgrade me to Executive Deluxe room with two twin beds. (I thought he just said no more room with two twin beds). Anyway, this will be my first and last time stay at this properties and would not come back if I came back for Japan trip. The services at the receptionist was okay like most reviewers mentioned. However, as I needed to use a Ta.Q. Bin to transferred my luggage to other hotel, the concierge guy was not helpful at all as I could not read Japanese. Even at Grand Nikko Odaiba, the concierge helped me to fill everything. At the end, I asked other concierge guy to help me filled the form for Ta-Q-Bin. The room is dirty and not like most properties in Japan. My mom and I were allergic to dust. While staying here, our body got itchy everywhere. The windows was very dirty and you can see from the picture I attached.Overall, I would not recommend people to stay here. I wish Marriott has more properties with better access to subway and train station which are closer to major attractions.

Tokyo is quite a distance from Yokohama if your doing similar so prepare for an expensive taxi ride of £110/$150 to this or any Tokyo central hotel. We arrived very early at 9.40 am and expected to just drop off bags and head off sightseeing but surprisingly we were allowed to check into our room at 10.00 am some 5 hours earlier than published check-in times - wonderful!Our room was on the 12th floor and was very nicely appointed although the bathroom was a little dated in terms of the bath/shower combination which is tending to be replaced with walk-in showers in similar quality hotels some of which also offer a separate bath and shower! wardrobe and drawer space was a little lacking for a full unpack however, which we didn't need to do but which some travellers might. Ironing board and iron provided alongside japenese style bathrobes and slippers. Toiletries provided in the bathroom were extensive and of excellent quality.House-keeping services were first-class in every respect but particularly in terms of requesting additional bottled water which was complimentary - this arrived within a few minutes on each request!This is a big hotel with 800+ rooms and staff did their utmost to make you feel a valued and important guest. Check-in desk staff were poilte, efficient and supportive as were the superbly informed and helpful concierge team who were there to help until 10.00 pm each night.The hotel offers a wide range of dining experiences bust we only used the Cascade Cafe for buffet breakfast and dinner each evening. Breakfast was superb in terms of the range and quality of food ordered but service beyond the first order of tea/coffee was quite hard to get as the facility was very busy indeed from 7.00 am onwards due to th business/tourist nature of the clientele staying at the hotel. Dinner was again excellent in terms of food choice and quality but again service could have been better bearing in mind that service charge and tax added an extra 20% to each bill and buffet service is not very onerous on staff.Breakfast was included in our room rate but dinner buffet came in around £52 pp on weekdays (more on week-ends) including tax and service. WE chose to eat in each day after long days on sightseeing tours etc which generally got us back to the hotel after 7.30 pm.The weather was glorious throughout and cherry blossom season had already started in Tokyo and had largely finished by April 5th - booking to see this event is impossible as this year it was early and many cruises etc plan for the middle of April. We saw a great deal of cherry blossom around japan from late March and some of the best was at this hotel along the road at the side of this hotel - absolutely wonderful lit up at night so catch it if and when you can.Suprisingly the pool area wasn't open and indeed wouldn't be until June which was disappointing to us given the weather. Our room had sight of the pool area and it looked like this needed a great deal of cleaning etc before opening but it would have been nice to use for a few hours and I note that the Mandarin Oriental in Singapore had iits pool open in early March and the Intercontinental in Kowloon had its pool open in February last year - something maybe for the hotel to think about in the future in terms of guest access in fabulous weather in April!On a negative note, the in room tea/coffee heater was unusable as it was impossible to work out and all instructions were in Japanese! There was very little coffee/creamer provided and no black tea even if we could have heated any water. Thankfully the in-house patisserie/coffee bar at lobby level was excellent but did close at an early 8.00 pm. The bathroom w/c bidet system was brilliant with very clear instructions. The Japanese are fastidious with regard to personal hygiene and we found this so in the majority of shopping malls and even in the many public facilities throughout Tokyo.We chose this hotel mainly for its location and as a pick-up point for all Tokyo sightseeing tours plus we knew and trusted the Intercontinental brand and had used them before. In Japan Intercontinental have a joint venture with ANA airways hence the prefix to the the hotel name. Bell desk services were exemplary and the bowler hatted greeting staff were superbly smart, efficient polite and supportive.The hotel is literally a few hundred yards away from Tameiko-sannay subway station and at least 4 different subway lines - great for your own sightseeing and shopping! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel, will definitely stay here again when we return to Tokyo and overall recommend this as the place to stay in Tokyo - expensive but worth it in our opinion",England,"straightjohnbull</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>England</strong>",103,5.0

I travel a lot for work and being an IHG platinum member for many years my loyalty gets the better of me and I keep making the mistake of staying here. The impression they give is they really don’t care for your loyalty compared to other IHG hotels or other hotel groups. Never a room upgrade or anything for continual visits and loyalty. Then comes the latest issue - I checked in only to be told the room i booked is not available and they would have to downgrade me. What makes this worse was that I was accidentally booked to stay the day before this by my company for my weeks stay and they bluntly said within one minute of me being at the counter that I have to pay for the previous night (which I was fine with as It was not their fault) but that was before telling me about to room downgrade. A lower grade room isn’t that big a deal but generally the rooms here are very old and tired and really need an upgrade to be at Intercontinental standard. The food is nothing special, and the service Is average and having recently stayed at the Hilton not far from here the Intercontinental pales in comparison in terms of quality.

Friendly, helpful, welcoming staff everywhere that will bend backwards for you. Great location, walking distance to Rippongi, we even walked to Ginza one day. World class to casual dinning all under the same roof. We got what we found out later was a non renovated junior suite which looked just fine, spacious, up to date with technology, huge clean shower and bathroom. English speaking staff everywhere, taxi always available, helpful concierge and front desk staff. You'd think that for the size of this hotel it would get away from management, but its impressive how everything is so well tuned.It's no Ritz Carlton or Peninsula, but for someone who usually does stay at those hotels I was still highly impressed. We visited elsewhere in Japan and when we returned from 2 days we stayed here again and were upgraded to the Club Level junior suite which had just been renovated and we were the first guests staying in it. Great upgrade, slightly more sleek and contemporary. They only thing they went cheap on was the automatic toilet seat, it was not a Toto, but some imitation which didn't work as well at the Toto we had in the original junior suite. The club level was wonderful - complimentary tea, happy hour with a light appetizer buffet, ""front desk"" services for club level members only, a light breakfast.

It is within walking distance of tons of bars and restaurants in Rappongi. It is also a short metro ride away from Ginza an upscale shopping district. Other Tokyo sites are relatively easy to access as well since the metro line has a stop right next to the hotel.In terms of facilities the hotel is good but not great. I have stayed in the intercontinental in Singapore, Osaka, and the barclay’s in New York and would rate their rooms all as slightly better than this one. I am guessing this hotel is a bit older. The hotel does have a host of restaurants including two Michelin stared ones which I did not have a chance to try.

Checked in for 5 nights and opted to have my own room. I have to thank Chihiro (I hope I got her name right!) for setting me up in a wonderful room. It really does pay to be part of the IHC club and I certainly felt valued upon check in. My room was spacious, updated, and comfortable - complete with hot water kettle, tea, coffee, and a mini fridge. I had a wonderful view and a quiet, peaceful sleep every single night.The hotel concierge staff were also incredible. We asked a lot of them during our stay. They were always polite, patient, insightful, and attempted to accommodate all of our requests. We made a number of restaurant reservations through them - all of which were fantastic.The hotel is also very convenient. The airport limo from both Narita and Haneda stop at the bottom floor of this hotel, making transportation in and out of Tokyo a snap. You can purchase your tickets from the front desk - my thanks to the staff for making this so easy for our group. The subway is a bit of a hike, but there is a tunnel connecting you underground so it's easy to navigate. There are also a ton of restaurants, cafes, and convenience stores adjacent to the hotel. Perfect for snacks or last minute shopping! I do have to caveat... Since I was vacationing with a big group of friends scattered across multiple rooms, it was interesting to see the stark difference in the quality of the rooms on club levels vs non club. While still comfortable, I must say that I have stayed in business hotels in Shibuya that were in much better shape for a lot less money. I certainly would not classify them as luxurious nor worthy of a 5-star hotel rating. If I had spent five nights in one of those rooms, this review would certainly look different.

One of my favorites world-wide. The Vibe: Classy hotel with modern updates and many dining and lounge options Location: Great location between Akasaka and Roppongi. Best way to reach this hotel from either airport is by Limo Bus (~$30USD). Closest train stops are Akasaka station and Roppongi Itchome station, both easily walkable from the hotel which is in the Ark Hills complex.Room & Bath: It would surprise most people how old this hotel actually is as the rooms are very nice, well maintained, spacious (for Tokyo), and with modern styling. Some rooms have great views of Tokyo tower and other areas of TokyoAmenities (wifi, gym, pool, etc.). Wifi is very good. Gym contains mainly cardio equipment and a universal machine. Pool is outside on 4F of the building. There is a beautiful club lounge which I use to access as Royal Ambassador in years past but now they have excluded this benefit and one can access only by payment or purchase of room type. Food & Beverage: The hotel has multiple dining and lounge choices with great buffet option on the lobby floor and other options on the floor above. There is also a nice two level lobby bar and a brandy/cigar bar on 2F with music most nights. Staff & Service Level: I have stayed here many times and have found the staff to be consistently helpful and polite. Misc. The hotel is located in Ark Hills complex which contains many other dining options and also a performing arts center. During cherry blossom time, the road behind the hotel is awesome in bloom. One can walk to both Roppongi (~10min) and Asakusa (~8min) for many more dining and entertainment options. Would I Repeat?: Absolutely.

My verdict is as others describe it which is: in need of an overhaul/refurbishment. Whilst the foyer may look fine, inside is not. It’s worn out and tired. For one night it’s fine but simply can not compare to equivalent star hotels around Asia. This is more like the Excelsior in Hk standard. I’d give it 3 stars.Location is fine if you have an office nearby and 15 Min walk to Roppongi Hills or 10 mins to Kamiyochi station.Whilst the hotel is getting old it is easy to get here from the Hamamutscho terminating station for the monorail from the airport. Cost ¥1,200 from the station to the hotel. The taxi fares are reasonable here and kept in pristine condition.I’m going to try a different hotel next time because this is just worn out and not very uplifting if you have work to do. Breakfast is normally 4,000Yen however you may get it for 2,900Yen on discount. You can try exiting on Level 3 for Ark Hills to pick up food into an office complex. Saves you having to walk out the front and around to get there, There are no international power points but you can ask for an adaptor. The points are all Japanese 2 flat vertical pins. Iron and board is standard but downside is no free bottle of water so just another thing I have to buy which is standard in other hotels in the same chain.Bathroom has a tub with a shower curtain and I appreciate it’s Tokyo and space is at a premium but it is dated. The toiletries don’t fit in the old tiled soap holder.There’s no bathroom Scale if you wondered.Fortunately there is a 7/11 or Family Mart nearby. The other convenience store but further way is called natural Lawson.Just a bit old so marked it average. The corporate photos are very glossed up compared to reality.

I usually stay in the Okura, which is well appointed and has quite spacious rooms, but just looks about 20 years out of date for a makeover. So this time I went to the ANA Intercontinental and found it pretty much the same.So maybe I'm just at odds with Japanese tastes. But the rooms, in fact the whole place, just seem dark and dated, as if the whole thing needs to be brightened.I should say the hotel staff were very good, and moved us up a few floors after the first room we were in was too dingy and small. It seems there had been some communication gone astray as we had asked for two interconnecting rooms and they didn't seem to be expecting it. So they were helpful and as polite as Japanese staff always are.It is well placed, particularly for any government meetings in Kasumigaseki, or for meetings up the hill in Ropponggi; Otemachi and Marunouchi are a bit further away but just a taxi or a subway ride.","Singapore, Singapore","CWrightMedia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",75,3.0

The rooms were stuffy and out of date, with no ventilation in the bathroom so that an enormous amount of condensation accumulated on the windows, even with the bathroom door shut, resulting in significant pooling of water on the window sill. I would wipe it off with a hand towel, which I would have to wring out four or five times to rid the window of water. I have never seen anything like it in any hotel, much less one that describes itself as Tokyo's best luxury hotel. Also, if you are female, you will not have access to the sauna facilities, which are MALE ONLY. This is not mentioned on the website. Simply unbelievable in 2018. One of our party arrived in his room to find a strong unpleasant smell in the bathroom, although it was promptly addressed upon reporting the issue. Finally, we had a number of issues with our reservations, including one of our Board members who was asked to check out early, despite the fact that we prepaid the room through the following day. This significantly disrupted her day. Another of our party arrived late only to find his prepaid room had been given away. The wifi, another business travel essential, was often slow and spotty.

This one is convenient as it is close to a lot of business quarters, often at walking distance. While it is a good 5 star, let’s not get spoiled, I was a bit disappointed. They had no clue about veggie food. There was hardly any vegetables at their big evening buffet, just a bit of mixed pieces of lettuce that had seen better days. No real vegg dishes. We had dinner also at their Chinese which was supposed to have a Michelin star somebody claimed but I thought service was so and so and non-heg food looked ok but not exceptional. Also no clue about veggie. My veggie degustation menu was as bland and ordinary as it gets. A scandal really. Then we had dinner in their high-end Japanese. Service was chaotic. I got all my dishes at once, in one big pile, which turned them cold of course. One of the others got his first dish once we were all done with our 4 courses. Other stuff arrived at random. Friendly and keen to serve, sure enough, but they could not understand our queries about the food. Again no clue about veggie food. Had to patch it together, half with side dishes. Aoart from the not-so-spicy wasabi, nothing really had any taste. Was outraged because of them taking pride in their sea cucumber dishes. We were just back from the Maldives and the Padi people were complaining the locals were illegally poaching all the sea cucumbers, which is catastrophic for the corals. All of this to ship them straight off to Japan for high prices.The Mixx bar at the top floor had seen better days and was one cloud of sigarette smoke. The rooms were small and must have looked good 40 years ago. Everything smelled of old carpets. This place needs an urgent refurbishment!Fitness was good but outdoor pool needs urgent lick of paint or more - see photo. You could summarize this as a hotel for smokers, as they were pampered in all restaurants, even the lobby lounge, etc. There was no escaping the clouds of smoke anywhere. Together with the brown decoration, It was a timewarp back to the end of the seventies when all places looked and smelled like this. The weekend afternoon tea was very nice though. So different from some of the other outstanding, world-class hotels I have had in Tokyo.

Unfortunately, this property greatly disappoints.Maybe because it was the holidays, the lobby was crowded like a zoo and we waited a little while before someone tended to us (although our luggage was taken by the bell captain before we walked in the door). The check-in itself was smooth, but we didn't get a room upgrade (which can be hit or miss at Intercontinental for Plat/Spire members) or the higher floor I requested two months ago or even the room type I booked (booked queen received twin).The room itself was the worst part. If you stick to downtown Tokyo standards, you can call it spacious. However, it just needs a renovation badly. The beds were less comfortable than the ones at a Crowne Plaza. There were only 4 power outlets in the room, and only two were functional. The Internet was slow (3 Mbps) and unencrypted. The A/C was too cold at 22c and too warm at 23c. If the room was on a higher floor, the view could've been good. But at 15F, all we got was the tip of Tokyo Tower and Roppongi Hills. Also, the lower-floors were only serviced by 2 elevators and we had to wait 2-3 minutes every time.The bathroom was even worse. The shower temperature was unstable, the bidet only has 3 buttons and uses a dial to control the water flow. The sink has a crack and the metal parts were rusty.The hotel was unable to offer us a different room as it was fully booked.Service was speedy and professional. The concierge was able to help us secure a last minute reservation at Bills (which itself was a disappointment) despite the restaurant told us they had no availability.Location-wise, if you are travelling for work, then it's very centrally located. However, if you use public transit, the nearest subway stations (Tameike-sanno, Akasaka or Roppongi-itchome) were 10 minutes away.I would not be wasting 56,000 JPY or 60,000 points at this hotel in the future and neither should anyone who's not travelling for work in Tokyo.

No questions asked, they were happy to do it for free.Upon check-in, there was a minor issue as the hotel was fully booked. Having waited for some time, i was instantly upgraded to the Junior Suite! What a treat!!! The room had an amazing view of tokyo. A separate bedroom and living room cum office area. They had several great restaurants including a 2 michelin star resto (too bad we didn’t get to go and try it). We did try the bar at the 36th floor, that again gave us an amazing view of tokyo at night time. We also tried the steakhouse for some wagyu!!!

Family of 4, 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 6 and 4). Stayed in room 1502 with a king size bed. We asked housekeeping to bring us 4 extra blankets and sheets, so made beds for kids on the floor. Worked very good. The room is very small based on American standards, but we weren’t there too much during the day, just to sleep at night :) the room did smell a bit with smoke, also there wasn’t a lot of lighting, wasn’t too bright. The mattress was very comfortable to our liking. We got nice terry bathrobes and good quality slippers. Amenities in the bathroom were amazing, top notch. We left the cards not to change our towels so we could reuse them, but the towels were exchanged any way. Had breakfast and dinner at Cascade restaurant. Outstanding food and amazing presentation. Cudos to F&B director and the chef. Restaurant was very busy for breakfast, but the buffet line never ran out of food and there was always enough staff to attend to our needs. Don’t know about buffet price as it was part of our group package. Couldn’t find any tea bags though on the buffet, looked like there were small individual tea carafes on the station with tea bags in them. But no variety/choices of tea where you can choose by yourself Had lunch at The Mixx on the 36th floor. One word: WOW. Staff is amazing, food delicious, presentation outstanding, view breathtaking Meeting rooms are nice, a bit hot though. Excellent line and dishes set up for coffee breaks. Small cups though, again, based on American standard. Check in was smooth, Russell from Australia was very courteous and acknowledged our IHG membership status.

The foyer is full of Americans as it is close to the embassy. One gets the feeling it is the choice of business people traveling to Japan. The price for a glass of wine or coffee in the foyer reflects this. The room is typical of a grand hotel that is starting to show its age. It has all the luxury appointments, is full of expensive marble etc but shows the wear signs from years of service. Regardless, its a wonderful room and generous in size for japan. In the court yard next to the hotel, there are numerous affordable cafes and restaurants. This was our last hotel at the end of a two week trip through Japan. Finding a burrito bar in the foyer was a welcome dietary change from noodles and rice. We stayed in Shinjuku when we first landed in Tokyo. I personally found more to see and do around Shinjuku than I found around the ANA. The ANA was our return hotel, coming back from Kyoto to Tokyo, prior to flying out. It's a perfect choice for this purpose as its easy to access by train and has an excellent shuttle bus service to the airport.

This was a business trip, so my booking was handled through corporate and I was reserved in a standard king room. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to upgrade my room prior to arrival because the online system could never find my reservation - long story that I won’t go into here. Upon arrival, there were no upgrades available.After visits to the Peninsula and Aman properties in July for vacation, I certainly wasn’t expecting 5 star accommodations, but the standard king was subpar. The next morning, I checked with the desk manager Russell and he was able to find a king room on the executive level for us. This was a totally different experience - very comfortable, fresh, modern, well appointed, with a fantastic view of the city. The shower was well designed with intuitive operations for the rain and handheld shower faucets (ladies, you know how frustrating it is to accidentally turn on the rain shower). Shout outs to Russell for securing this room for me and checking on my wellbeing throughout my stay - he went above and beyond, ensuring a pleasant stay.The executive lounge is equally pleasant with wonderful meal and drink services throughout the day. The space was well designed and comfortable. Truly a space that you could relax in. The staff lounge staff was exceptionally helpful, pleasant, and genuinely caring.I visited the fitness room each morning and enjoyed the clean, cool space. It was never too crowded, but could use 1 more elliptical and 1 less treadmill. The Mixx bar was a great place to enjoy a cocktail and light meal. A shout out to Kor (I hope I got the name right) for excellent service each time I visited.Overall, enjoyed my stay and here are a few things for the hotel to consider as they evolve the offerings forward -- A welcome email. I didn’t discover the airport shuttle until check-out, too late for me to us. I couldn’t upgrade till I got to the front desk, too late, nothing available.- Update the standard rooms, if nothing more than fresh carpetingand drapes, and a shower door.- fragrance of the enviro and bath product are too heavily cologned. Choose a less polarizing scent.- add and elliptical to the fitness room and light snacks (ie, raisins, fruits, etc.).- the elevators are super slow, not sure if anything can be done about that.","New York City, New York","Advourner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",72,4.0

When asked to make a reservation at a restaurant they didn't come across to happy to have to call up the restaurant, and spent ages on the phone to tell me afterwards that the restaurant did not accept reservations because they were very busy, and just go there and try our luck, most of the restaurants I went to were not as bad as the Concierges told me they would be and we never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get a table. Eventually we just stopped going to the Concierges for assistance and made our own way across town.

The breakfast buffet (according to my guest) was the best during our stay in multiple hotels in Japan. It is large, varied and has convenient hours. My biggest issue was the 4000 Yen per person charge for using the pool. I think that is outrageous - approximately $75 for a couple to use the pool! I complained about this at the front desk. In all fairness, Mr. Nakajima at the front desk listened patiently and then offered us free pool passes for the duration of our stay.

Perhaps it's my lack of experience with travel in Japan (vs. places like China, Singapore, Australia, and US), or perhaps it was just a case of being in the right place at the right time, but I sincerely, highly, and deeply enjoyed this hotel. The customer service was delightful. The room was clean with lots of nice features and amenities. The bed was comfortable. There was ample space for luggage and for moving around. What's more, I slept extremely soundly, as the room (and likely the area surrounding the hotel) was quiet throughout the night. The construction of the hotel dampened out noise from overhead and from adjacent rooms. It was almost poetic to draw back the blinds and to be greeted by the gentle dawn around 5AM in ""The Land of the Rising Sun"". Both the breakfast and the room service meals were delicious. The wifi was fast. The area surrounding the hotel made it easy to dine, shop, have coffee, and take the subway (eg. walk up to Roppongi in one direction or down to the Ginza subway line in the opposite direction). A lot of my previous misperceptions and misconceptions of travel in Japan (based on a lonely trip in Yokohama last year) melted away at this hotel. It required (or perhaps allowed) me to reframe the past to have a whole new picture of Japan. Cannot wait to take a long weekend vacation in Tokyo.

Tameike-sanno subway entrance (4 lines) is less than 5 mins walk away, but then walk to the platform is another 5 mins +. This gives easyish access to most places you wish to visit. NB For the M line it is almost a km through the station. Taxis are a good option cY1300 to get to Ginza.4) Facilities - we were attracted by the pool, and knew the cost, but didn't realise the exorbitant charge is per visit rather than per day (i.e. you pay twice to use it before and after going out. We didn't use it. Similarly children not welcome upstairs to see the view at night. And drinks charges etc are ridiculous. 5) Service - generally very good if a little impersonal. Concierge support was mixed.Overall, would recommend looking at Courtyard Marriott Ginza as a better option for a family stay.Also - 2 key Tokyo recommendations I wish I'd known sooner - use the JR loop line.

Next thing I know, we did get the outdated (classic) rooms! I honestly wouldn't have minded them so much if I hadn't paid that much money and if it wasn't a renowned chain like the Intercontinental.

A couple of days in the hotel, and I guess we just got used to the rooms. All the staff from concierge, to hotel porters and to security guards and housekeeping were super friendly and courteous.

Our room was also spacious (for Tokyo standard) and it was well equipped with high quality amenities. As an IHG member I was entitled to free Wifi; the connection was fast and smooth. The location of the Hotel is perfect for exploring Tokyo as it is well connected with two subway stations. Exit #13 of Takeike-Sanno Station, which is a connecting hub for 3 subway lines, is just in front of the escalators connecting to the main lobby. However one has to allow 10 minutes walk from the platform to exit #13 and there are also climbing steps in between. There is a foot bridge connecting the hotel lobby to the Akasaka Station and the time to walk to the Station is about 5 minutes; no need to walk on any steps as both escalator and lift are available. Taking the subway from these two nearby Stations to Shibuya, Ginza and Roppongi is within 15 minutes. Adjacent to the Akasaka Station are two small but well equipped supermarkets and a number of restaurants for casual dinning. The front desk officer Chihiro Sawada who helped me for check in was absolutely great. She provided us a great overview of the Hotel and the needed information in a highly professional manner. We could not have asked for more. Ymke Simonis and Miho Obana working at the concierge were also delightful and helpful recommending us dinning options and making the reservation for us. Without their help it was impossible for us to have such great memorable dinning experience in Tokyo. Indeed all the staff working in this Hotel were very friendly. We highly enjoyed the buffet breakfast at Cascade Café. There was a great selection of food covering both pastries, cold cut and hot food.

Decided on the ANA Intercontinental as it had an outdoor swimming pool which is an extra I always look for as I enjoy getting by the pool and either cooling off or reading a book to get some sun. To find out that I would have to pay AUD$50 each time to sit by or swim in the pool was absolutely ridiculous and I've travelled to many parts of the world and not encountered this before, so it was no pool for me this time which was disappointing. Next thing that didn't impressed me was that although I arrived late to the hotel (during the night) there were no staff on to greet me, take my bags, usher me to check in etc which I felt again was disappointing and not welcoming at all. There were only the check in staff and thankfully check in was ok. I booked a 2 double bed classic non smoking room and was upgraded to a higher floor or so I was advised. The room was clean, reasonably spacious and looked a little tired to me. The shower seemed a bit grotty as well and I really think that perhaps the hotel could do with a soft furb upgrade to help freshen it up a bit, particularly the bathrooms. What I had booked also included breakfast and whilst it was busy (had to queue before being seen to a table) it was a substantial buffet breakfast so there were no complaints there. You could walk to the subway station (about 5-7 mins) which is handy if you wanted to go everywhere by train. One night enjoyed a walk up to Roppongi Hills (took about half an hour to get there - it's uphill from the hotel) and it seemed a nice area to be in. Felt safe and it was clean everywhere we went.The staff in the hotel were generally good, although some of them, their English was poor which I thought was strange for a large international property. Service was ok as well. I expected better from both, the staff and the service.Lastly, I'm an IHG Platinum elite status member and joined the Ambassador program before I left for Japan. Did all my room bookings via the IHG website (was staying at other IHG hotels while I was in Japan) and was advised that I wouldn't have to pay for my accommodation when I checked out except for any mini bar purchases and anything else that I may have incurred during my stay which I was fine with. So when it came to check out I was given my bill and it seemed that my credit card hadn't been charged when I made the final booking back in Australia and so I was not happy with all that, as it seemed that all my IHG bookings were now not paid and it seemed that I would have to pay for each of them upon check out at each new hotel. This didn't impress me at all. In fact it put a dampener on the stay at the hotel and it wasn't a good start to the holiday. Anyway it was sorted in the end and the hotel made a goodwill gesture of reducing my account which I was thankful for as it was IHG's mistake that nothing had been prepaid. Last time I book anything via a hotel website.Would I stay here again, no probably not. Although having stayed in another hotel in Tokyo on the way back, the location of the hotel was ideal to subway and surrounding area / district.","Melbourne, Australia","Helen W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",46,3.0

A short walk (1.7km) and you're in Roppongi and if you like to walk, another 4km and you're in the midst of Shibuya, although there are many multiple stations within close proximity to get you there. A 20 min walk in the opposite direction and it's easy to explore Ginza, therefore, a great location to base yourself from. The aesthetic of the hotel is quite nice however the bathrooms are slightly dated. If possible, a package with breakfast included is the optimum choice as the breakfast buffet is quite expensive. There are many stores within close proximity such as 7 eleven and Lawson, which offer an array for cheap food and beverage options such as salads, sushi, bento, beer, wine and sake. If in need, they also offer a small selection of toiletries as well as confectionary. Mixx Bar and Lounge on the 36th floor provides quite a nice outlook over Roppongi and the Atrium bar is quite large. The live entertainment was underwhelming, tired and generic and detracted from the atmosphere of each space. This was disappointing considering how creative and dynamic Tokyo is.

Outstanding. Our room was awesome, the location on a long weekend was really quiet but very accessible to everywhere we wanted to go and there were loads of interesting restaurants in the vicinity as well as in the hotel itself.

This recognition transcended language and accent barriers late at night and were helpful after a long flight with my wife and daughter....we just wanted to get to our hotel and rest. I was considering a rival brand with same club access at the Odaiba area but Intercon was better located and the price difference was a wash. We were here for almost a week and truly Intercon was able to anticipate our needs.Room. We upgraded to the Club Intercontinental room. I thought this was worth it considering all the extra privileges that a club level opened up. We got the Premier room which was smaller than most American rooms but in Tokyo expect space to be premium. We got a King bed a love seat with an ottoman which was perfect for me. Though the room was small, the design afforded maximum use of all the spaces available: drawers and extra storage spaces afforded us to store almost one week's worth of luggage with room to spare. An umbrella was inside the closet, a shoe brush, shoe horn, shoe and laundry bag. The room was serviced twice and bottled water was replaced every time. Wireless wifi was strong and a cable data port was also provided which I used (as my work still doesn't provide wireless laptops).Bathroom. Again small by American standard but very well equipped. The seat had the Japanese style bidet wash with multiple control selections. Seat was heated. A flat screen TV was inside. Auto flush sensor. Amenities were standard Intercon which was very well stocked. A basin style sink and luxurious bath were standard.Lobby. It was huge more like a shopping mall. There were 2 levels with a good size restaurant, stores, and meeting places. At least one or two ladies in traditional kimono gown greeted and provided a warm welcome to guests. The rotating (revolving?) doors had safety features that prevented getting clipped. A door man was outside assisting in luggage or opened doors for taxis. At night there was live music on the 2nd level.Club Lounge. Located on the 35th floor, entrance was controlled by key card for club members. Then you were greeted by your name at the reception desk by the hostess. Wait staff will cater to your needs: will arrange tables for your party, provide a menu, and ask what drink you preferred.Club Lounge meals. Though it was buffet style, a menu was handed by the staff for additional ala carte items. Both buffet and ala carte had western and Asian choices. Meal service were for Bfast, afternoon high tea which I believe is an Intercon tradition/standard, and an evening reception. I especially loved the afternoon high tea as intricately prepared sandwiches (small portions) and sweets/desserts were offered. For the dessert they served these local delicacy that included what they called sasa mochi, which were a type of rice cake wrapped in leaf and then tied in a bow. These presentation of desserts I've experienced only in Japan where desserts are so beautifully wrapped and packaged, I almost don't want to open it as it will ruin the visuals. The desserts were also delivered to your table on a multi level tray for an added touch of luxury. The evening reception added alcohol on the all day available beverages. Tapas were added again both western and Asian selections. Desserts, finger foods, cookies, peanuts were available. The drinks beverages that were available all day were your standard Coca Cola selections, Suntory tea, canned juices, and bottled water.Club meeting room. I used the well equipped meeting room for some work items. The office administrator will set up the schedule your office needs and the room. Pens notepads will be provided. VTC was available thought I didn't need it. And by the way the Intercon provided pens were much higher quality than the Marriott pens I've ever received.Club service/concierge. The hostess booked transportation requirements. We availed of the 'romance train' to Hakone and also our departing limousine bus to Haneda. We tried getting the Shinkansen/bullet train through the hostess but the JR office was closed on that evening so we did it ourselves by showing up at the JR train office the following day. They also provided us with detailed itinerary, train maps, schedule and even which exit to take on the train stations.Location. The area is called Chiyoda. It took 25 minutes via limousine bus from Haneda. It was a 2 minute walk (with an Intercon provided outdoor escalator) to a Tokyo subway Tameike Sanno. This was part of the Ginza line which took us on the same line without transfers to some of Tokyo's top attractions. Ginza line terminated on Shibuya (shibuya scramble, shibuya 109 shopping, Hachicko Memorial). Also Ginza line terminated on the other end at Asakusa station (Sensoji Temple and Nakamise shopping street). Along the same station took us to the Harajuku area via the Omote sanno station. Of course Ginza station was the old commercial still vibrant shopping area. Within walking distance was Roponggi. The concierge will say that taking the train will be longer. We did take the taxi. One can see from the Club Lounge floor the Japanese Diet (Parliament) and the Imperial Palace grounds. Tokyo Sky tree was an 870 yen taxi fare. So was Roponggi.When my daughter realized our stay was ending and we were going home she was a bit sad. IHG was that good. Will certainly return again on our next trip to Japan.","San Diego, California, USA","herfer67</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California, USA</strong>",83,5.0

Getting into the hotel from Narita airport, however, is a bit limited with only hourly stops on the airport limo bus.

Once at the hotel, it's reasonably appointed and the breakfast buffet is large and diverse. Other than breakfast, however, there are plenty of restaurant options nearby -- including the Akasaka and Roppongi Hills areas if you don't mind the walk, or even Ark Hills right next door -- that give wider variety and higher value. The hotel is older, that's true, and some rooms could be updated. There's a fee for the gym, but with so much walking to/from meetings, I got sufficient exercise without the gym. My only pet peeve was the delay in getting the room serviced -- which sometime wasn't until late in the day.

The only downer was the Teppanyaki Restaurant (Teppanyaki Akasaka) which seemed a bit over rated considering its status and reviews on TripAdvisor and seriously expensive - cost us more than Yen50,000 for 2 adults and a child with local (not Wagu or Kobe) beef and half a bottle of wine. We had a much better Teppanyaki experience at Mon Cher Ton Ton in Roppongi - much more variety, size of portions, taste, theatre and half the price of Teppanyaki Alaska","Singapore, Singapore","Ben T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",11,4.0

Stayed at the Intercontinental in Singapore last year and it was really nice and luxurious so was expecting something similar here, but it wasn't the case.The common areas of the hotel are really nice but entering the room was like stepping into a different, much less posh, world. The fixtures are not in bad condition but they are just spartan and not welcoming/cosy as you would expect from a top-rate hotel. The bathroom was the old type with shower curtains - I'm used to seeing them at American hotel chains, but not in nice hotels in Asia. It was also very cramped - had to slide in between the toilet and sink or tub in order to open and close the door. The layout could have definitely been designed better.The layout of the room could also be improved as sideways walking was required to access the bed from the side along the wall, while there was lots of space on the window side. Another reason for the spaciousness on the window side is that there is a tiny kid-sized couch. Would be better off replacing it with a comfortable adult-sized armchair if not a larger couch (which there was definitely room for). Sleep quality left much to be desired as I regularly woke up with pain in my hip. At first I was unsure if it was me, however the pain has not returned since returning home to my own bed, so I am blaming it on the bed. It is the cheap type of mattress. The pillows were horrible. They were down pillows but inadequately stuffed - once you lie on them they pretty much disappear into nothingness. I took the extra pillow from the closet which was the buckwheat type and it was like a brick. I woke up one time with ear pain from being squished between my head and the brick pillow. I was wondering if it was perhaps a Japanese thing to provide bedding that was suited to back-sleeping, but remembered that the Grand Hyatt is super comfortable. I will stay there next time.Also, while it may appear that there are several subway lines within walking distance of the hotel, all of these are substantial walks of about 15 minutes, all but one involving uphill climbs. It got tiring after a while.","Singapore, Singapore","Nitpicker011</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",112,2.0

I stayed here a couple times before and as a premier member, I received an upgrade so my room was a bit better, newer with a little more space so absolutely no problem at all. Staff is very well trained and professional, a plus there as well. However, similar to many other InterCon properties elsewhere, you don't get any premier member benefits like free breakfast or lounge access at this hotel unless you are willing to spend a lot more money (the lounge access at this hotel will cost you a whopping 15,000 yen a day additionally which I found it a bit absurd). InterCon group really needs to re-think their policy before losing too much business to Marriott/SPG Group where I get all these benefits free as a premier member.

The size of the room does not compromise on the experience as there is a very efficient use of the space. The hotel has a Michelin starred restaurant on the top floor and in case you don't want to indulge, there is a fantastic bakery by Michelin Starred chef that serves fabulous pastries.

This is a large, sprawling hotel catering to business people. We stayed in a junior suite with club lounge. I was somewhat concerned about booking this room, because the photos on the hotel website were inadequate and the visitor photos I found on the internet were not the best. Anyway, I had reason to be wary. The suite is oddly configured with the bedroom and living room not really separated by a door or room divider----sort of railway style. Room was clean but furniture and furnishings could use an update---or better yet, a complete renovation. There was a curtain---not a door---separating the bedroom and bathroom----really!!! Comfortable bed, but small closet and inadequate storage place for clothes on a long stay. TVs in bedroom and living room. Two swivel club chairs and desk chair in living room Inadequate lighting throughout. Unable to read after dark. The ANA considers itself first class hotel and prices itself that way----very expensive even by Tokyo standards. While the hotel services are first class, the rooms (at least from my experience) simply don't measure up.The club lounge is huge. It is superbly managed by Junko Kano and the staff are friendly, professional and excellent at their jobs. There is a large area for dining and another separate large area for relaxing. Breakfast is superb. Large buffet plus a multi page menu for custom ordered western and Asian/Japanese dishes----all perfectly prepared.Evening drinks and canapes are also excellent. Again, a large buffet and you can order freshly prepared Asian and western set plates, each with three small bite items.There is a bartender who will prepare your custom ordered drinks and the premium selection of champagnes, wines and spirits is quite fine. The only negative about the lounge is the very poor lighting. unless you are using an electric device, it is simply impossible to read after dark.We ate at the hotel's steakhouse as well as the buffet restaurant. The steak house meal was great-----but very pricey. The buffet had great variety, but too many dishes were not replenished in a timely manner and were not available or too stale to eat.The hotel has many other restaurants, but visitors would be well advised to walk a few steps to the complex next door. Tremendous variety of restaurants and coffee shops. Much better pricing as well.The hotel is not in a tourist area, but there is a metro station just a few steps away and you can get pretty much anywhere in Tokyo comfortably and inexpensively.

Appreciated for the upgrade, but it'd feel better if they could've done it right at first place, not until they got call from the IHG ambassador service center.As to the room I stayed, I believe it belongs to the areas which haven't been renovated yet, didn't feel like a five star hotel room for me, dated furniture and design.

From the moment of our booking, the hotel's communications were terrific. An e-mail to the concierge resulted in a seamless airport transfer to the hotel. Stops at at the well staffed concierge desk inquiring about local restaurants, resulted in detailed handouts of a broad variety of recommendations, across all prices ranges and within walking distance. An inquiry about assistance with a train booking resulted in tickets being ordered from a local travel agent and delivered to us at the hotel. The room size was one of the largest we encountered in Japan, mid-way up a 30+ floor tower, with great views, nice amenities and easy access. Room service was quick, menus tasty. There is a small mall of shops within the hotel that offered florists services, a variety of food and beverage and other products. Breakfast (included in our plan), was perhaps the most extensive buffet (both Japanese and Western) styles, all warm, flavorful and for some dishes, cooked to order).

Given that I am a Gold Ambassador and we stayed as a couple for 11 nights I’m not sure why we got ‘one of the smaller rooms’. I guess the lesson is, complain if you want a decent room. Our second room was 4 square metres bigger but the vanity had no space for toiletries for 2 so we needed to use the bath for storage.At breakfast dirty dishes were seldom cleared and being offered a coffee refill was rare. The breakfast queues were exacerbated by lack of staff. At 06:50 one morning when there were plenty of empty tables I waited for 10 minutes whilst the single reception person dithered from receiving guests to collecting payments.Housekeeping was good, especially considering the lack of space in the room and the service line responded quickly to requests for foam pillows.The room came equiped with a Bose speaker but it didn’t sync with my phone - I suspect the bluetooth was broken.

I was so busy that I didn't get a chance to visit any of the hotel restaurants - next time.The staff is super with many English speaking Westerners who are beyond helpful with recommendations for anything - the last day I realized I seriously over-shopped and needed an inexpensive suitcase. Got the best recommendation and ended up with so much more! I took a taxi from Haneda airport to the hotel but upon departure the hotel suggest a non stop Limousine bus to Narita which is almost 2 hours away and $170.00 USD cheaper than a taxi and super comfortable and convenient!

However, the bedroom was kinda disappointing... it was aged and the deco, furniture & carpet was really quite old. I was pleasantly surprised that there are no basic amenities like international charger, complimentary drinking water or bath robes (till we requested) and if u need ironing for your work shirt or dresses; u need to be very patient as the iron needs to be charged for at least a few hours to be fully functional or fully ""heated"" up. The only thing we really really don't fancy was the bed which was soft and the pillows were unbelievable flat and soft as well; totally no support for our necks. We requested for firm pillows on the 2nd night, and was kindly informed that the hotel ran out of firm pillows then. However, the housekeeping mgr was kind enough to pass us 3 in the evening when the firm pillows stock return.On the bed's mattress - it was not firm and not well-supported: example: whenever I toss & turn at night, my partner will be woken and vice versa. aka zero ""motion isolation"" we can feel each other ""tossing"" We went to work not fully rested.We have been to other IHG chain of hotels ard the world, we felt ANA Hotel Interncon may want to put some work on their beds and pillows. Observed that most of the guests are business travelers, a good night rest after a long day of work or conference is only essential. It may really help with better pillows and bed mattresses. (Our room is a std room, perhaps an upgraded room may have better amenities, mattress and pillows.?)

I have always been impressed with the level of service from the front counter staff, concierge, and bar/lounge servers. The Japanese restaurant (not the Teppanyaki place) is also good, but a bit expensive. Not that surprising given that it is a hotel restaurant in the nice part of town. The rooms, however, are getting dated. I have stayed in multiple room types and I must admit that as compared to other ICs that I have stayed at, the quality of the room is lower. A simple thing such as a universal power plug is not available, and USB chargers are also unavailable. Seems strange for such a high-tech country like Japan. On the positive (apart from the service which I am always happy with), the coffee shop is good for a quick breakfast (better value for money than the lounge or lobby restaurant). It is very convenient to the Roppongi, Omotesando and Akasaka areas which are full of excellent food choices and nightlife. From a work standpoint, my meetings are spread out between Shinjuku and Marunouchi so I usually take taxis to save time. I do think of the ANA as my home away from home when in Tokyo but I may look at other options. Saying that, as an IC Ambassador, I'll probably stay loyal....","Hong Kong, China","frijoles213</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",9,3.0

However, Kano-san directed me to a lovely Onsen type amusement facility in Tokyo, not far away, which more than made up for no pool at the hotel.

It was a good stay overall. My room was a Premiere King Room on the 31st floor with a view of the Tokyo Tower. Things I liked about my room/stay:-- the view of the Tokyo Tower was a plus and the hotel honored my preferences for rooms located on higher floors away from the elevators;-- the complimentary 2x bottled water per day; -- electric blinds and bedside control panel for lighting, etc.;-- bath had very, very strong (absolutely glorious) water pressure;-- the water heater just worked;-- this being Japan, the toilet had a built-in washlet (bidet) with the controls located on the wall beside the toilet;-- port hub (that's what I'm calling it) on the TV table featuring USB (powered and able to charge your device), AVI, HDMI and other connectors;-- desk level electrical outlets on the bedside tables;-- the expertly positioned pin light which ensured that a usable part of the bathroom mirror does not fog-up while you're taking a shower;-- complete toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, toothbrush, sewing kit, cotton buds, etc.);-- breakfast was great. Staff were international/multi-lingual (one was absolutely Filipino and another was likely Nordic) and quite efficient in getting diners seated quickly. Requests were also handled quickly. Food variety was great, from American to Continental to Chinese and Japanese breakfast staples. I loved the Museli and juices + the crispy bacon on offer. Things I didn't like, annoyances:-- Combination tub and shower. I think all Intercontinental Hotels should offer a separate bath and shower, even in the lowest room categories (and mine was only a step-below the Junior Suites). But if I can't have that, I'd rather have a stand-alone shower;-- the shower was a handheld unit. (I would rather have both a fixed and hand held hower.)The water pressure was so strong that the torque caused the shower head, if it was in its cradle/holder, to move towards the right (facing the wall), thereby somewhat negating the glorious pressure;-- the sink counter-top didn't exude an expensive feel (more like 3-1/2 star Holiday Inn);-- bathroom walls ring thin/hollow when you tap on them (a pet peeve of mine);-- at 28 sq. meters room size was on the small side;-- pillows sank way too low;-- interior design of the room was ""ehh"", not bad, mind you, but nothing stands out. Notes:-- unlike lower category rooms, my Premiere Room did not have those bolted on shampoo, conditioner dispensers (which I think should never make an appearance in a 4-5 star hotel);-- the in-room safe is built in to a cabinet located below the TV and opens from the top;-- WiFi worked. I got a little bit les than 20 mbps on download, if I recall correctly;-- mattress was firm but not overly so (the most firm I ever had was in a hotel in China) and I slept well enough;-- it was so cold outside at night (compared to the comparably comfortable 22-24C of my room that condensation formed on the inside of my room window;-- the toilet has a small LCD TV and remote;-- Premiere Rooms have Keurig single serve coffee makers and mugs;-- I also had a tea pot, tea cups and saucers on a bamboo mat, if you prefer tea;-- the hotel is close to a subway entrance/exit (Exit 13, Tameike-Sanno) but be aware that it's a long walk (about 300 meters) before you actually hit the first subway line.The hotel is right beside an elevated expressway. I did not explore the area opposite the elevated expressway or, for that matter, any of the immediately surrounding area.

Very disappointing experience, for a relatively luxurious hotel ($250-300 range). After the initial (negative) review, I got contacted by somebody in the customer relations but they did not do anything actively. Just told me to contact them. They should have done more actively if they could do something.I think I was told when I checked out of my first stay that they remember my email, name, etc. so that they can accommodate my preferences the next time. I checked in again a couple of days later, but I wasn't informed of anything. Maybe they did adjust to my preferences without telling me but it would have helped that they actually remembered my name as they told me.In the second time I stayed, the bathtub was sort of clogged. It took about 5 min to drain the water when I was taking the shower. Not feeling well for an expensive room. In general, the furniture, and the interior, is old, for the price range.Once I went running and left my running clothes beside the window to dry them. After the daily cleaning, the clothes were moved away from the window.In the end, I think you can do a lot better for the price range of $250-300 per night in Tokyo. I don't think I would stay again. IO say this for the first time for a luxurious hotel in Tokyo.Pros:(1) Location is great, close to Roppongi, Akasaka, Ginza, etc. A lot of restaurants nearby (like 5-10 min walk)(2) Quiet area.(3) Good service in general.(4) Luxurious feeling in the reception area, with multiple bars/restaurants and piano played in the evening.(5) Large room for Tokyo standard(6) Free wifi (you need to sign up with their frequent customer membership)(7) Nice bar on top of the buildingCons(1) Not superb service for the class (see the beginning of my review)(2) Room interior and furniture feel old and depreciated.(3) In general, cabs going in and out of the hotel drive very recklessly. I almost got hit by a cab which did not stop at the stop sign (to get out of the hotel quickly) a couple of times.(4) Maybe the price is different, but the receptionist did not ask me how many keys I need. I was surprised that they did not ask it.Overall, it's not a bad hotel by any means, but for the class ($250-300), you can do a lot better in many other hotels in Tokyo. For the price range, so far the worst in my experiences so far. I am not sure I would come back. Definitely not my first choice in the future.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Makoto N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",110,2.0

I chose it because it is old school - a hotel with everything, that is oriented to foreign business travellers, and where everything works. Location is good US and Australian Embassies, government ministries and of course, firms in the adjacent Ark Hills complex. The big draw here for me is service -- it is genuinely friendly and really world-class. I booked a junior suite for 2 days of business meetings and was upgraded. I appreciated being able to check in 3 hours early and when I mentioned that I had a conference call about to start, there was no problem getting into the room ten minutes before the 12.30pm room availability. The business centre was also fast and flexible. We entertained a business guest in the Karin Chinese restaurant in the hotel and the food and service were flawless.Feeding the team was easy because the hotel connects through to the Ark Hills office complex, which is fully of lunch restaurants, as well as a Starbucks, Dean and Deluca and small supermarket.Depending on your taste, the hotel decor is either charmingly retro or a bit outdated. My suite was very spacious, but the carpet and furnishings needed an overhaul. The gym is well-equipped and spacious. The Thann Spa is less than a year old; its pristine and the massage I had was outstanding, and well-priced for Tokyo.Low points? The breakfast buffet is a little old-fashioned; surely even travelling Americans don't eat donuts for breakfast these days? It is heaving with people and quite noisy, so not an option for a breakfast meeting. But that shortcoming aside, this is still a great hotel. The prices reflect that, but as the Japanese say, the 'cospa' (cost performance) is really good.","Canberra, Australia","Fushiki_Tea</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",24,5.0

Even we stay for only one night for the 1st stay in this trip. We got a nice room on 20th Fl., maybe renovated one as it looks different from the one we stayed last year.All the hotel staffs are very helpful and courteous. The 1st receptionist (I could not read her name tag) tried to get us a room before check-in time as she knew we may need to take a shower or use the bathroom, quite thoughtful and caring. Unluckily, the room was not ready yet. We told her that we would like to leave our luggages only and then come back in the evening for check-in later. She informed us about the promotion, to get 600 points or 1 welcome drink for this stay which we were in a hurry to JR train station to reserve the seat to Nikko and Hokkaido. She even repeated asking to keep our benefits for this promotion when we told her that we will decide later. Moreover, she also noted in the hotel system that this trip is for my birthday celebration. When we came back to check-in, the 2nd receptionist told us that the room is ready with a birthday cookies (Godiva). This surprisingly exceeded my expectation as I am not the Spire elite holder myself, my husband is. Since I am also another top tier of the other hotel chains like Accor (Platinum) and HHonors (Diamond), only the cardholder would get the birthday gift (other benefits such as drinking water, upgraded room, lounge access, breakfast and evening cocktail here for a free night are not complimentary and automatically provided like the other chains though). Anyway, I guess it is the chain policy, not the hotel itself. What the staffs did is already quite impressive and made me reconsider on choosing IHG for our next leisure trip. We once fell in love with Intercontinental Osaka 2 years ago, by a warm welcome from the door to the room, now we did here again. The room is nice and spacious, compare to others in Tokyo. Only a little thing is the pillows are too flat for us (included a spared one in the closet). If the hotel has a thicker or firmer one or the pillow choices like other IHG hotels in some areas, everything here would be completely perfect. The access from Narita airport to this hotel is quite convenient by Narita airport limousine bus which costs 3,100¥, for round trip only 4,500¥. Just be aware of the subway station access. It is Tameike-sanno, exit 13, the entrance is a few steps from the hotel but no escalator, no lift nearby and the distance to platform is around 500 m. For any traveller who carries a light luggage and businessman who has a pick-up service, this hotel is definitely recommended. Otherwise, should directly checked with the hotel as I may not know the best way.Sadly, we had to check-out in the early morning. So, I have no chance to take the any photo of our room. Will soon do it during my 2nd stay after coming back from Hokkaido.","Bangkok, Thailand","Lastlove</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",37,5.0

The breakfast buffet is pricy at $26 at the discounted rate but as buffets go this one was outstanding.

Decent location with Roppongi Hills up the street a mile or so and there is a metro station right outside. Bus service to Narita is a available right from the hotel.

This hotel provides professionalism with none of the warmth that one expects from Japanese hospitality. The check in service was thorough and efficient but the wait was long and the staff were not apologetic. A lot of the attention was given to the IHG Rewards members (we are not members) so we did feel a little 'dismissed'. Now for the rooms: the size was great - much larger than the average Japanese room. The bed was a little lumpy and saggy, probably needed a new mattress? The pillow was very disappointing - it was literally a deflated lump. There were little signs of wear and tear everywhere so the hotel is probably due for an upgrade. The room wasn't cheap but it is located in the business district so you get a lot of restaurants, cafes, two subway lines (the Namboku line and the Ginza Line) within walking distance and it is also walking distance to Roppongi, for the nightlife.

Our room was a Junior Suite which the perfect amount of space for our family throughout the stay. The bathroom is impressive, large tub & shower area and luxe amenities (bathrobes and pajamas) are provided. I particularly enjoyed the doors which closed off the bedroom to the sitting area, so that if our toddler was napping we could comfortably hang out and watch TV, work, etc in the other room. The only downside for this room is that the bathroom is located through the sleeping area. The sitting area houses a desk, dry bar, small sofa with coffee table and tv. The room is definitely worth booking if you need (or just want) the extra space. We had a view of the pool and general city. Curtains can be controlled by bedside which is fun and useful! The club lounge is really great at this hotel. The breakfast is extensive and you can enter anytime of day for NA drinks and fast concierge service. Additionally, the appetizer service in the evening with drinks is quite extensive as well. There is also a light tea service mid day as well. I highly recommend it, the staff is very friendly and happy to assist with any needs you may have. Generally, service here is good, the housekeeping is a bit different than what you'll encounter in the US. By that I mean that the room is cleaned however, let's say you leave your ironing board out, it stays out. If a half full soda is left out, it will be there when you return. I get the sense that this is normal here as the room was extensively cleaned elsewhere but just something to note. The gym is bright and has a variety of equipment for those traveling. The biggest plus to this hotel is the outdoor pool, great for families as they have a separate kid pool as well. We stayed in August and the pool got very crowded as some locals have a membership. There is an additional fee for the pool, be prepared for that if you plan to use it. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.

It's close to the subway, with Roppongi being the closest station, and there are always taxis ready to whisk you anywhere you need to be in the city. The hotel itself is pretty standard in comparison to any other big hotel. There is a big lobby and check in and everything else seems to be relatively impersonal. Staff were helpful, but as a whole seemed to be missing the warmth that other hotels might focus on. Room was a decent size by Tokyo standards, bathroom amenities were nice and the bed was comfortable. It did feel like the room needed a deep cleaning but I'm not sure if it was just my room though.I did not eat at the restaurants in the hotel, but I will say the prices for a coffee if you were to sit in the lobby were exorbitant. 12 USD for drip and 14 for a caramel latte. That is a little too steep even when considering it's in a hotel. I did grab coffee and pastries in the morning at the french bakery in the shopping arcade attached to the lobby and those prices were much more reasonable; just too bad the hours are limited.

The bathroom is well appointed, though the shower is the in-bath type, albeit of good quality. As befits this kind of international class 5* hotel there are numerous restaurants and shops. It is very well located, about 15 minutes’ walk from the Imperial Palace and, more to the point, just a minute or two from stops giving four lines on Tokyo’s unnervingly efficient metro system. It is also next door to the Suntory concert hall. The breakfast buffet is top class and comprehensive, though a queue can form at weekends. The view from the buffet area breakfast is of overhead roads and passing traffic - but this is central Tokyo. The only reservation is price. If you are being paid for or lashing out then it is a superb hotel. For Europeans on any other basis it is expensive. There is a pool, but like many Japanese hotels this charges even for hotel residents, and at nearly £30 per person per day the fee is ridiculous and prohibitive. We didn’t even contemplate using the pool at this price and one wonders if this kind of pricing is counter-productive, though it is not unusual in Japan.

But what it misses is any real sense of Tokyo or Japanese culture and hospitality. You could easily be staying in any generic city in the world. Upon arrival, you enter a large high ceilinged lobby that houses a lounge, restaurant and reception, with many other restaurants on the Mezzanine and a small shopping area adjacent. There is a very unpleasant smell throughout the hotel...like old cigarette smoke they have never successfully cleaned out of the carpets and curtains. Reception was reasonably efficient, but did not really have the charm of Japanese service. Join the IHP loyalty club for free internet. I stayed in one of the ""classic"" rooms on the 10th floor. The corridors are low ceilinged, narrow, and have worn carpeting. The rooms was fairly small with 2 twin beds (no kings were available) and a view of a small neighborhood shrine. The furnishings were not new, but not terribly worn. There was just enough closet space, a small desk, and a small refrigerator and water heater for coffee/tea. The bathroom was very old feeling, with a small tub/shower with a lighweight shower curtain that clung to me in that creepy way of hotel shower curtains. Overall it felt dated and cramped, but clean. Breakfast was in the lobby restaurant...a giant buffet with many options....but none of them especially tasty. Pastries were rather heavy, prepared eggs wet and rubbery, and all the food tasted the same. On the plus side, there was tasty crisp bacon, which I appreciated. There was a French bakery in the small mall, and they had a couple of good takeaway sandwich options. There is also a good Starbucks and a small grocery store in the building just adjacent.

Reading reviews, blogs, asking friends and investigating way into the night... I have so much I want to share about Tokyo from a practical perspective but I will focus on this hotel during this post.We opted for the easiest ( in our mind ) way to get from airport to hotel and after a very long passport immigration it was almost midnight... we chose a cab which looking back is easy in thought. The line or que was so long. The fair was expensive but to be expected. about $45 USD or 5000 yen (2016). I always use Google maps to make sure the driver is heading in the right direction. We pulled up to the hotel and it was awesome. Most hotels don't have massive curb appeal because of how things are set up here. I am not saying it isn't beautiful just a bit more spatially challenged. We were met immediately with bellmen and doormen at midnight and the bags carefully whisked away. We were met by Russell who is an Australian working in Tokyo for IHG and was an exceptional steward of this hotel. He made sure we had the best option available as we were only at this hotel for two nights. He did everything to accommodate an upgrade to make it special but alas with some rooms being smoking and it late, we stayed with the room we had reserved. The room was normal US standard size but the details were spot on. It is a beautiful hotel room with five star bath soaps and coffees. The bedding was European down and very comfortable. The AC functioned great especially in the summer humidity. Ok so we wake up and head to the breakfast. WOW! It was an orchestra of food set on the second floor of the hotel with lots of light coming in through the windows. Food was Chinese, Japanese, English traditional breakfast (yup limp bacon! yuck) French and everything in between. I had the cold Soba noodles, Chinese dumplings, croissants (excellent French croissants) meats from Europe like Jamon Iberica and fruits and salads. We did this for two days and did not tire of the excellent quality of food and service. It was part of our room package and I would recommend it when booking your room.But wait ... it gets better... around the corner there is a small in-hotel shopping area is a cafe.. not just any cafe. Pierre Gagniare has set up a European pastry shop to die for! His desserts and pastries are a must try... and we did stop in so many times. The ladies that work there are gems... They became family in our short stay. Go for the desserts but the service is special too! (There is a two star Pierre Gagniare restaurant on the top but we did not try as we were traveling with kids!)... But we did try the in-house steak house. We were still tired and jet lagged so we couldn't make the trek out to dinner so we stayed in... It was very good but not exceptional (I think they are shooting for exceptional). The steak I shared with my wife was a wagyu thinly sliced and grilled perfectly. I think it was very tender but this cut did not show off the quality of the meat. And from where we come from we like it big and thick. My kids shared a filet and it was perfect. The service was excellent especially in those awkward moments (granted we don't speak Japanese so I can't complain) but my wife ordered a cosmopolitan to drink. They did not know what she was talking about but they left the restaurant (I watched them) and went downstairs to the bartender and they made one... That is special service, albeit awkward sometimes. Everything to this point is spot on. Here are some stand out things. Russell at the front desk tirelessly checking on us, the concierge who don't take tips but give the best service I have experienced in the world, the staff that come out and wave goodbye as you drive away.

The rooms are different sizes and I got a club floor room so slightly larger and a coffee maker. A shower + bathtub is somewhat of a luxury in Tokyo city center. The bath amenities were great! The room had a queen sized double bed, typical IC comfort and option of pillows, something I always appreciate and really helps the sleep quality! The breakfast spread is more than what you can ask for ( as always ) specially if you have dietary restrictions there's always something. Location is great as well, In the consular area but a few train stops away from shibuya and shinjuku so you can get around or also the roppongi area affords good places to eat or a more colorful nightlife if that's what you're looking for.  However, for everything you get the place is steeply priced. Almost 300€ a night? Okura next doors is equally good ( although a lot of construction on right now ) but at least 40-50€ cheaper a night. If they managed their room pricing a bit better ( for early bookings at least ) would automatically become the best premium option. However they're already always full so I guess they can afford to be the priciest.

This is truly a 5 star hotel, and the level of service in the club lounge made it more like a 6! We stayed here for two nights in June 2016. Upon check in, we were given a complimentary upgrade and had a great view of the Tokyo tower. Unfortunately, when we checked in, our room had a strong unpleasant smell. We spoke to housekeeping and they provided a air purifier which was helpful. We spent a little time exploring the hotel. There are a lot of restaurants, and the buffet looked top notch. We didn't actually eat at any of the restaurants, because we spent most of our eating times up in the club lounge or out in the city. Speaking of the club lounge, the hotel will tell you that they have the biggest hotel club lounge in Tokyo. The best part though, was the level of service. I would argue that they have the best club lounge service! I can't praise the manager, Junko, her assistant manager, supervisor, and rest of staff (including intern, Nao) enough! Besides helping us book a spa appointment the same day, book the airport limo bus, recommend restaurants, what we really enjoyed was getting to know them as people. It was great talking to them about their city, their travels, and what they love about their hotel. When it came to the food and drinks at the lounge, these were truly delicious and presented very professionally! We tried the breakfast, which was almost like a full buffet, as well as the happy hour, which was basically a dinner. There are also snacks and non alcoholic drinks in the afternoon. There were always plenty of drinks to go around, whether you wanted a custom cafe latte in the morning, or special cocktail in the evening. One tip though is to get there early, because the best tables next to the Windows tend to fill up first. However, the couches were very comfortable for lounging. We did book a massage treatment and while not a big facility, it was still very relaxing and a nice way to end our anniversary trip. We also spent some time at the gym. The facility was pretty impressive, and had all the weights and machines I would expect from a high end hotel. We were surprised that there was a fee to use the pool. It wasn't pool weather when we were there, but we did walk around and check it out.I look forward to visiting this hotel again! Tokyo is a fantastic city and I would highly recommend staying here if you can. Oh, and do yourself a favor and visit the club lounge.

The kingsize bed was very comfortable and there was plenty of space to relax. Wifi was included as I am a ICH member but I believe there is a charge if you are not (which is unbelievable now days especially in Tokyo). The hotel has multiple restaurants of which I only tried the Japanese, the food was fantastic but on the dear side, I would recommend eating out. The hotel also has a swimming pool of which, when I looked (in May and very hot) no one was using it.Both Roppongi and Akasaka are within walking distance so you do not need to go far to find restaurants and bars. I did read that Roppongi can be a little seedy or dangerous side but I did not experience this. Ark Hills itself is fairly quite with a few bars and restaurants in the shopping mall.For a base to sight see Tokyo, the hotel is ok, the metro station entrance is right on your door step but as previously mentioned, depending on what line you want, the walk can be rather long as although you may see directions to other lines, you are in fact walking to another station.I would recommend the ANA as it is a lovely hotel but it is primarily geared up for business guests then leisure. The staff are very friendly and will assist you with any questions that you have. The main reason I have not given the hotel 5 stars is that the restaurants are experience and although the location is good, you can do better in Tokyo. My other main gripe is that you can not book club rooms with club access, you need to book club access seperately and at over £100 per person is outrageous.",London,"Jamesxi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",21,4.0

This is a good selection for a business traveler but there may be better options. The lobby areas are fantastically large with many selections of restaurants/dining/bars. The staff is bilingual with good English; service was very good in the restaurants and bars. Beware that the restaurants in the hotel are expensive but there are less expensive options in the office building next door. Also the multiple lobby areas are always full of people...lots of American businessmen, pilots, government workers, etc. The doormen were extremely helpful with cabs and giving directions & addresses to the drivers. Airport limo bus service was easy and inexpensive. Watch your time...it can take up to 1 1/2 hours to get to Narita airport to/from hotel. The pool costs $40 daily fee to use and is only open in summer; the gym is good and free. Spa was nice but they don't speak much English!Now to the rooms; the rooms are small and the beds are hard. The carpet is worn. No bottled water supplied in the rooms like I am used to at luxury hotels worldwide. The bathroom was small but clean. The toilets are Japanese [heated seats, lots of buttons...google how to use!]. Hairdryers & irons in the rooms. I would recommend upgrading to the executive floor and paying the $80 for the executive lounge....the rooms are better/bigger, the breakfast is almost as good as downstairs and if you have more than 1 person traveling you will save money b/c it's free in the lounge. There are also lots of seating areas where you can conduct meetings, unlike the lobby which is always crowded. Wish we had figured this out before our final two days!

We were checked in at a higher floor, so we had a good view at night. Check-in was efficient. There was a slight mistake in our booking, but they were able to correct it without any bother to us. Staff were all very nice, especially the concierge. It was our first time to visit Tokyo and they were very helpful. We made a mistake in buying a Tokyo-wide pass ticket for 3 days only to learn that we won't be able to use it in the metro train stations. The concierge called JR East and arranged a refund for us even though the start date has already begun (we never got to use the ticket on our 1st day). They also gave us access maps of nearby areas in the hotel as well as train maps. I would have made this a five-star review, but on our 2nd day for breakfast, there was a long line already before 6:30am. (Breakfast starts at 6am). Most people who filled the breakfast table were the ""men in black"" mentioned in other reviews here. When we finally got in the buffet area, there was very little food left. For example, typically they have two types of bacon:crispy bacon and simply bacon. During that day, only the crispy bacon was left (at 6:45am). Most of the pastries were gone too. In fact, most of everything was gone. They were able to refill the buffet spread, but that was a lag in their service. It's understandable to some extent since the area is near a lot of embassies. But if this is something that happens often, the hotel should have addressed this already. Other than that, everything else went as we expected in an Intercontinental hotel. It was a very good experience, but it didn't blow our mind or exceeded our expectations.Once you go outside the hotel, Tameike san station of Ginza line is below it.

The staff are very attentive, very professional, and very friendly. I really can't say enough, from Russell at the Concierge to every waiter in the lobby cafe.There are several excellent choices for dining. All are very pricey (par for Tokyo), but none will disappoint. If you choose to eat a meal in the lobby cafe (Cascade), I recommend taking the buffet option unless you don't want to interrupt a business meal. The menu will be much more expensive, and you will not have nearly the variety of food choices (all of which are excellent) if you order off of the menu.The rooms are well appointed, but lacking in light switches. A master controls the room, but then each light is operated individually. There are no wall switches to control groups of lights, which is both curious and a little annoying. There are, however, lots of lamps and wall lights to choose from. There is an excellent desk with lamp, but power is a single wall socket with only two plugs. A major disappointment is the WiFi, which is very slow. any web intensive work will become annoying.The bathrooms are small by American standards, but very normal by Eastern standards. As in all Japanese hotels, most foreigners will want to spend some time with an instruction manual for the toilet, which has as many controls as a small jet. The sink has plenty of counterspace. The shower is a bit tight, but with wonderful water pressure. As in much of the Orient, all bathing supplies are installed in pump containers mounted in the shower. Inexplicably, the bathroom floor is very worn and shabby.Cigars are very expensive in the lobby shop (bring your own), but there is a wonderful bar on the second floor to relax with one and a good scotch. There are a variety of shops and restaurants within walking distance, both to the left towards Rappongi, across the (very busy) street behind the golf shop, and across the street to the right and up the hill (go around the left of the ""ATT"" building, then up and down a small hill to a very ""bourbon street"" area with great food and drink.

When I arrived to check in, I was greeted by a guest relations officer at the check in counter (ambassador check in) , she didn’t bother much to explain my room facilities nor did she bother to explain what my room package was to offer. She told me in a curt way that the room was not available and I should just head to the gym to shower to freshen up should I want to, I asked her what time the room would be available but she told me that she cannot confirm as the guest inside the room was a VIP though I explained to her that I was offered to check in earlier by the chief concierge as my flight to arrive was earlier in the morning. Nonetheless, I agreed that since the hotel was full and I had no choice but to shower at the gym and go out till a later time. I went out to have my meal with my clients.Usually as a priority guest in the other hotels (SPG- my rooms would be ready. KEIO plaza hotel as a normal guest, my room was ready as I arrived in the same flight in the same season).The experience was made worse when I wanted to obtain the luggage form the concierge/ bell personnel. The gentlemen at the counter wasn’t courteous, was rather impatient, he passed off some Japanese remarks at me, which I couldn’t understand. I thought that he was universal in behaviour however; to my shock and disbelief he was very courteous to another person who was American! I found this unbecoming of a hotel!I returned to the hotel at 4pm, I proceeded to the Check In Counter again and my room was ready, I was just passed the keys to the room and I was not directed to the room, and I was made to wait for 45 minutes for my luggage with my clients in the room as the documents that I needed to pass to them was inside my luggage. I have no clue whatsoever on how they are in they set their service quality standards or why they are practicing preferential treatment in regards to the nationality of guest. I am a Singaporean Chinese and I don’t believe that I have been rude to any of the hotel staff at all.This is highly disappointing and unbecoming.","Singapore, Singapore","S D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",4,1.0

Have stayed at the Intercontinental hotels lots of times so am a Platinum Ambassador and as such managed to get a 5 night stay pretty much all on points here. Started brilliantly with my wife asking if we had a refurbished room (had read from previous reviews that this was the way to go) and being told that we had been upgraded and just got better from there onwards. We had chosen to take the Club Intercontinental package as part of the stay, and let me say as a tip it's totally worth it! Breakfasts - fantastic, afternoon tea - lovely, evening cocktails and canapés - outstanding. Not many places give you champagne as part of the Club package - usually good sparkling - but they do here and it's great. The food is beautifully presented and tastes delicious, with a really wide variety to suit all tastes - kudos to the kitchen team. As for the staff in general, outstanding! The concierge gave us loads of ideas for our time in Tokyo and was spot on with where to see the cherry blossoms, the team in the Club Lounge were all excellent and looked after us really well, and our room was always looking first class with the room service also being spot on. The stay was finally capped by a bottle of complimentary champagne being delivered to our room as part of our anniversary / my birthday celebrations. Sounds like I'm raving, but seriously this was a 6 out of 5 stay (and don't forget to take the Club package)!","Singapore, Singapore","DrProg_13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",47,5.0

They told me they cannot give me a complimentary bottle of water. There are also no complimentary bottles of water in the rooms or the gym. Another annoyance is no free wifi, no even in the communal areas. Hotel is extremely poor value given the sub par service, dated rooms and the fact that they scrimp on low value items.

We stayed in a double room. The room was very old style. The toilet was not great at all. I expected more from an intercontinental hotel. The food at the steak house was alright, but honestly, not as good as how much it was cost though. Only outdoor pool and opens only during summer period. It'd be nice to have an indoor one. The room would only give you free wifi if you were IHG member, luckily my husband was. If not, it seemed you needed to pay for wifi. However, they provided with Shiseido shower Jel, shampoo and conditioner, which was nice. Locationwise, it located in Roppongi area right above Tameiko-sanno station which made the trip so much easier (however, you would get to the train after walking through the station for around 5-8 mins, to me it's not too bad, at least there's cover when it's raining). Only a few restaurants around the hotel. But you could find many restaurants when you walk around 10mins towards the Toronmo area. There's a street full of restaurants. it's only one station away from Akasaka-mitsuke station and only needed to change to the opposite platform for the marunouchi line to Shinjuku station. It took only around 15 mins to Shinjuku! Moreover, you could go to Shibuya station from Tameike-Sanno station directly for only about 10-15 mins by Ginza line. Walkable distance to Roppongi Hills and Tokyo Midtown, which would be nice for people who want to do some shopping there ( but these two malls were boring malls for me, as they sold only western brands, not as fun as in Keio/Mylord/Odakyu department stalls). And yes, it was easy to go to Ueno station, again by Ginza line. It took around 20mins only.The hotel staff at the reception and the information area were very nice and helpful.Stayed at this hotel for six nights. Before we left Japan, we went to Hakone for three days. ANA intercontinental hotel was nice enough to let us leave our luggage at the hotel after checkout. This made our trip to Hakone a lot easier.We came to the hotel by limousine bus. Cost around 3100 yen per person. We did the same back to the airport. However, I reseved the return trip limousine bus tickets three days ago at the ticket booth on the second floor of the hotel. I saw the staff wrote down my room number and my name for the reservation and he also confirmed the reservation was made. When the time we got back our luggage and went to the ticket office on the first floor, the staff couldn't find our reservation. Luckily there were still some seats left for us!! But it's a bit annoying. This bus took around 1.30 hours to and from the airport. The first stop from the airport was ANA intercontinental hotel. Very easy.

The hotel is quite dated now and although the rooms are very big for Tokyo, the bathrooms are in need of renovation. The location is not great as the Oedo line which is in the closest station doesn't really go anywhere nice that I would want to go to. Outside of the hotel is a major road with a freeway going over it so it's not nice to walk around. Behind the hotel is the US embassy, so again, not much to do around the area. One positive was the gym which was small but modern and functional. Also, the bakery on the lobby floor was very nice. I would stay in Ginza the next time for all the restaurants, or near a Yamanote-line station which is a more useful line that takes you to all the major areas (Shibuya, Harajuku, Yanaka, Tokyo, Shinjuku etc).

The first room seemed renovated and immaculately made up, and featured excellent bathroom amenities (individual bottles of shampoo, lotion, conditioner, etc). The second room was slightly older but still comfortable--however, the bathroom had a dispenser on the wall for all the shampoo and conditioner, etc. It was not a huge problem, however, it was slightly disconcerting, considering we had paid the same rate for both rooms and I don't usually encounter wall dispensers in hotels of this caliber.

The bathroom was clean (though very small) - the toilet was fitted with the usual electronic features expected in Japan, but the shower screen was a curtain, which is uncommon in IC hotels, which usually have a glass screen (the glass is highly preferable).Breakfast was a major disappointment - there is no a-la-carte option, with both the steakhouse and the buffet in the lobby serving pre-prepared food. There were no live cooking stations and the selection overall was poor. I opted to have a pastry in Pain et Gateaux de Pierre Gagnaire, also in the lobby (shops area), which was much better quality but did not offer any cooked options, as the name would suggest.Overall, I would likely stay here again due to the location and the good bars / restaurants, but I expect the service levels to improve if my business is to be assured.","Balsall Common, United Kingdom","h3nry0</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Balsall Common, United Kingdom</strong>",56,3.0

However I was really disappointed about the rooms and actually most of my stay at ANA intercontinental. Rooms are old fashioned, and really need an upgrade. As an example the ring inside the sink is rusted. Room desk etc is really not nice or 5 star but rather run down, and honestly something I associate with one or two stars less brands. My room was booked relatively late, but the high expense (and knowing the Tokyo market well) was in no way met by a great room. One of my biggest disappointments (apart from the oft occurring habit in Tokyo of breakfast not being included in a 500 dollar night room) was that there was no bottled shampoo, soap and conditioner. Intercontinental in Japan normally provide an excellent brand - called agrara or some thing similar. Here I got from that brand a bar of soap, and cheapo wall mounted dispensers for industrial quality shampoo etc. This is not going to cut it for someone who needs to look presentable in the office the next day. Also missing from any 5 star lineup - moisturizer. Again an excellent brand is provided in other Intercontinential hotels in Japan. Overall I did not feel at all that my needs to be clean and look good was taken care of. The room itself was clean but there was a think layer of dust on the back of the bathroom shaving mirror, and the overall feeling of the bathroom was old fashion, impractical and not particularly clean or at the very least yellow with age. The checkin staff was well presented / looked good / spoke English well, but made little extra effort, despite the over average rate, high IHG status, I guess the place was full. There is a cool bar with good service and great views on one of the top floors.

Imagine feeling like you need to throw up all the time.What I don't appreciate is being lied to.Finally, I asked again and for the third time, was moved to a floor where there were non-smoking room signs. I could settle for the night.I realised that the lowest category of rooms sold are in a bad condition. The non-smoking rooms are in a higher category of rooms.But I had stayed at another hotel in a different district a few days before and paid half the price, got a bigger room with a better view.Is there a better alternative if one has to attend a business meeting there again?

It’s a mega-hotel, with more than 30 floors and built with a convention center in the lower levels. It’s a very upscale hotel. The lobby area is actually two floors, with an elevated bar/lounge that often has live music (piano and sax) player. There’s a large ground floor lounge, adjacent to the main restaurant on the ground floor. Breakfast buffet is about $30, and offers a very wide range of foods, both European, American, and Asian. It’s all very good with a lot of choices. Also on the upper level is a wide range of upper-end stores that are probably beyond the budgets of most people. Just outside the hotel are restaurants and shops that are part of the Ark Hills development. These are much more affordable than the restaurants in the hotel. There are a couple of great stores connected including two coffee shops, a Lawson market, and a small grocery store. There’s even a couple of banks connected. Getting to the Ginza line takes a bit of walk, probably at least 10 mins underground to the get the Metro. A bit long for my tastes. The workout area is good, with two elliptical, six treadmills, and a set of dumbbells. The cardio machines face outside, so it’s a pretty good view. Six weight machines round out the facility. The hotel has an outdoor pool, more of a lounging pool than for swimming laps. In general the gym is good. Not the best in Tokyo, but pretty good. The top floor has a lounge with a great view and great vibe. The concierge team was very helpful, and recommended some nice restaurants that were new. The lobby has a cool money exchange machine. You simply put in a wide assortment of paper money, and the machine spits back money in Japanese Yen. Didn’t have a chance to check the exchange rate, but the convenience of the machine is pretty cool. The room amenities are good. The rooms have more drawer space than most hotels. Rooms have a bathrobe, morning paper, pressing station, teapot, shoe horn, toilet kit, and lots of good shampoos. The shower system is good but wasnt very hot. All in all, a good upper end hotel. Depending on the rate available, it could be a very good. The walk for metro access is a little long, but some travelers don’t use the Metro.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","finestbob</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",60,4.0

The service in this hotel is excellent, from the doorman to everywhere to go in the hotel. I must single out the Club Lounge Manger, Ms. Junko ( hope I got her name correct ) and her team at the Club Lounge. I'm always made so welcomed each time I'm there and Ms. Junko is forever so super helpful and I really think she live in the Club Lounge as I see her in the early hours of the morning and late at night, so hard working and dedicated. The staff at the Club Lounge made me so welcomed, like they have known me for years. It made my stay so comfortable even though it was my trip to Tokyo.You can see Mount Fuji from the Club Lounge. Unfortunately it is not winter yet, so there is no snow cap on it but still majestic.I had a corner room with a great view of the city and like any InterContinental hotels, the rooms are super luxurious with all kinds of amenities such as your own coffee machine. The size of the room is large compared to your average hotel rooms in Japan. The greatest part of the room must be the walk in shower. The shower has an in built body spray and together with the overhead water jet, I don't want my shower to end each time. With the high pressure water together with their shower system, it is like having a water massage, what a feeling.There is a subway station within 2 minutes walk from the hotel and you can get everywhere easily and Roppongi Hills is just about 15 minute walk. The breakfast and evening cocktails at the club lounge is fantastic compared to many club lounges in the world.I have stayed in so many hotels and not many I will go back again because it is my nature to try different hotels in each city so that I get to experienced as many as possible but the next time I am in Tokyo again, I will stay here.

But feel like need to say something. My partner and I stayed in the Capitol Hotel (EXCELLENT HOTEL TO STAY, COMPARE WITH THIS INTERCON), but due to its availability, we had to move to this Intercon on the very last day in Tokyo. Thinking of leaving the hotel very early the next day, I decided to use my points to redeem one night. Sales girl on the phone, said even if the website only provided twin beds, certainly we could manage to ask the reception to change to a queen/king size bed. But when we check in, the answer was no. Ok, not a problem for us. But then we said we would rather check in late, but prefer to have a smoking room. The girl at the reception typed for a while and replied no again, no room available… (exactly like CAROL in Little Britain “No… Computer says on…”). It was like 9am in the morning, just say it you want to keep the rooms for those who pay, and do not care a member who redeems his points (after keeping choosing IHG hotels!!!) Sorry, maybe it is true that that day the hotel was fully booked, but the fact she did not even try to make efforts really make me uncomfortable with the way how you treat your members. The answer was just a No with few words, it was really like you do not pay, you only get what we offer. That's all...BTW, a bit more info. before your decision.For those who say the hotel is nice, the facilities are at least 30 years old. For those who say the hotel has good shops, restaurants, please you are in Tokyo, anything is available.

ANA Intercontinental is a beautiful hotel, elegant, upscale, modern and quiet. Is not a typical tourist hotel, is more of a traveling business executives place. Is very large and with all the typical amenities, spa, gym, pool, several upscale restaurants and shops, business center, etc. Pool is out doors with a beautiful setting, nothing spectacular but nice. Rooms are (to my surprise) very spacious and comfortable, nothing spectacular or luxurious but simple, sufficient, clean and always superb service. Is a top 4 star hotel and it can be pricey but you can shop for good fares though the usual suspects sites (Expedia, travelocity, etc.) and get great deals. Our room is typically $225 US and we got it for $145 US. The service is amazing but this is no surprise as all Japanese people are super friendly, respectful and honest. Their #1 priority is to give great service no matter what store, restaurant, place you are. There is a 7Eleven and a small supermarket about a block away. There are more restaurants about half a block from the hotel and the Roppongi district is only a 15 minute walk with lots of shops and a big night life trend.Overall the ANA Intercontinental should not disappoint you no matter how picky you are. Great hotel! Tokyo is a huge city and very similar to the size and feel of New York. Tourist attractions are spread out through the city so there really is not ""best zone"" to find a hotel. No matter what part of the city you stay, you will have to take cab/ subway, to get to other attractions. Tokyo is a very large city and you can take cabs (expensive due to the large distances) or take the subway. BELIEVE ME, the subway is the EASIEST way to get around and soooooo simple to understand. The Tameike-sanno station of the Ginza line is literally at the corner of the hotel. All stations are named in japanese and have the english translation below that. All the machines have English display information. If you have any questions about subway use, please email me.","New York City, New York","Artied1976</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",10,5.0

Rooms are large by Tokyo standards. The bathroom was awesome, with a great soaking tub and an adjustable height shower head. This hotel is right next to a Metro station that is a hub for many of the lines, so traveling was simple. If you want to be able to get places quickly, this is a great place to stay.Negatives: The beds were extremely firm/hard, which I guess is standard for Tokyo, but it made sleeping difficult at times for us. There really isn't an inexpensive restaurant/food option in the hotel, especially for breakfast (and no ""gift shop"" selling food items).

Our check in was smooth (I was welcomed as an IHG member instantly) at around 830 am and we were given an early check in but on the smoking floor. The room we were told was non smoking but there was an ashtray in the room and the smell wasn't pleasant. The room was only set for 2 people and had tiny beds and when I requested a change in room, the Assistant Guest Relation Manager (Russell) took charge and had a new room made available for us on the 20th floor (with a great view of the city), allowing us to use the smoking room to freshen and rest up. We had a Classic room similar to http://www.anaintercontinental-tokyo.jp/e/room/classic.html and this was big enough for 3 adults.All of the front desk staff staff were amazing and looked after us really well. Concierge and baggage service was first class. Our only disappointment was when eating in the hotel Cascade Cafe Restaurant. Myself and daughter had the buffet which although excellent we felt was very overpriced (as is the wine), but the main problem was the poor service we received. We had to request our ordered drinks on several occasions and used plates were not cleared away, so we were eating dessert with our main course plates still on the table. We had to ask to have them removed. We received zero attention from the waiting staff and had to chase them down when we needed anything. Very disappointing considering the hotel is an Intercontinental and when you are spending a lot of money in a restaurant you expect better. This black mark unfortunately pulled down my service rating.We also went up to the pool which was very nice and very empty. We were wondering why, and when we noticed that it was £20 to use the pool, we realised why.To recap .. hotel was excellent, staff were excellent apart from awful restaurant service (we didn't eat in again), room was big enough for 3 adults and had a great view, location was great due to the metro next door and plenty of good restaurants nearby.

I was having high expectations but upon arriving I was not identified as an IHG gold member. After the process at the reception I asked the reception if she was aware that I'm an IHG member and she said ""i know"".  The room was very compact and small. After the breakfast when entering the room, I noticed the cleaner was coming out from the washroom and quickly left the room without saying anything. When I walked into the room I noticed my bag and my wife's bag were opened. I had a few country currency in my bag. I noticed my Myanmar currency was at the washroom. I immediately went out to tell my brother and I noticed the cleaner was staring at me at one corner. Later I reported to the management and they did some tracking and also spoke to the cleaner but she did not confess anything. Finally my case was just left like that and my whole vacation was spoilt as I was disturbed. I requested the management not to clean my room for the 3 days I stayed as I was worried. Hence I stayed in the room for 3 days without having it cleaned. It was the most unpleasant experience for me and my wife.  Another shock was the swimming pool was chargeable. The hotel was already so expensive and they are also charging for using the swimming pool. I checked and there was no one in the swimming pool. 6 of us rushed to the sky bar to get the happy hour. And we doubled up our order thinking that we are getting our happy hour promotion as the front guy told us that happy hour is still on. Only after ordering we were told that the happy hour is going to end in 10 minutes and we are not entitled for the happy hour price. Most of the staffs don't understand English.

Though I didn't necessarily plan to stay at this hotel due to my previous experiences, I ended up staying here as my other preferred hotel was full occupied during those dates.1. Location : Its pretty well located, quite nearby to a metro station. Decent walk away from Roppongi and nearby to other attractions as well. 2. Connectivity to airport : It has got a direct Airport Limousine (bus) connectivity fro m the Narita Airport, and that is a very good advantage. Its super convenient to connect to the Narita Airport , though as the airport is far it takes around 70-90min if I remember well.3. Rooms : Rooms are decent. They are quite spacious unlike other hotels in Tokyo. I know how small other hotel rooms could be , so this one a big plus point for this hotel. The mattresses are comfortable, and decor is decent as well.4. View from Room : First time the view from my room was very nice, however last 2 times I wasn't that happy about it (even though I was at 21st floor)...maybe because I kept comparing it with my first experience at this place.5. Technology in Room : Wifi was good , no complaints..I had complimentary wifi due to my membership to IHG. The lighting could be controlled by a central panel next to bed, however the curtains had to be manually adjusted. TV didn't have many English channels from what I remember, but still comparably better than what is offered in other hotels. Lighting was proper in the room.6. Bathroom in the room: Bathroom wasn't too big, though there was a bathtub, the whole bathroom seemed extremely small even for one person. The shower pressure, amenities, etc were good. 7. HouseKeeping : Room was kept well whenever I came in, no complaints from that side. 8. Other for Room : This was my only complaint - There were no free water bottle provided in the room. Paying a premium over other hotels, free water bottles should be the least expected from a 5 star. I dont like drinking from tap water, and certainly don't like paying 5 times picking a bottled water from the mini-bar. I didn't like this part of cost cutting from ANA.9. Restaurants : I ate breakfast at the Cafe at Lobby level, and the spread was ok. It wasn't lavish , neither was it too shabby. I would have expected a better variety spread from Intercontinental though, so wasn't highly impressed with the offerings. Some international food items were under cooked and taste of few items brought a shame to the legacy of such items ( such as Tandoori Chicken).10. Gym : Gym wasn't too big , the free weight options were very limited ( there wasn't even a curl bar), had only one bench. I could notice lots of people waiting to use the free weights but there wasn't enough space nor options. If someone just wants to run on trendmill , it should be ok, as I think they had around 5.11. Steam / Sauna : There was no steam room, which is a big miss. Had a Sauna room in one corner. Overall a decent place, however I would look to try another hotel next time.","National Capital Territory of Delhi, India","PuneetB_99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>National Capital Territory of Delhi, India</strong>",5,4.0

Why so loyal: Flawless service, wonderful concierge, comfortable rooms, easy bus/shuttle connections to Narita and Haneda, great location, walking distance to Imperial Palace (good place to run), and nice hotel features (pool, exercise facilities). Downside: Lack of free Internet (unless you are a club member or book a room at top pricing tier); on major holidays, the restaurant may run out of capacity so book a reservation if you plan to be on site for dinner). For non-Japanese speakers, access to an excellent concierge is vital to satisfaction, and Ms. Momoi deserves her golden keys designation. She has good advice (always), makes great restaurant recommendations (and facilitates reservations), and has a good understanding of what tourists can and can't handle with respect to subway/train. She makes visiting Tokyo a wonderful experience, even for travelers who lack local language skills. The hotel is connected to Ark Hills with many shops and restaurants, and is walkable to the lively Roppongi district.

There we noticed how the rooms differentiate and how much nicer it was. Besides that, the service with all the hotel staff was great. They helped us in such a way that was heart warming.

This could be where the local hoodlums get trained on extortion techniques.Finally, get ready for breakfast - long queues, approximate service and fairly average-to-poor food quality make for a very unpleasant experience. If you arrive near closing time, at 10.30am, hang on to your hat - at 10.32am there were already half of all items removed by staff on what seemed to be some sort of race to clear things as fast and as noisily as possible.Overall, a very basic and very large hotel with some flaws...","Singapore, Singapore","apactraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",269,2.0

Shinjuku, a 15 min taxi ride away.

The hotel was able to meet my last minute accommodation request with no issues whatsoever. Prior to checking out of the hotel I was staying at previously, I contacted the ANA InterContinental and requested to check in approximately four hours early. The hotel immediately accepted this request, and upon check in I was instantly upgraded to a suite on the 28 floor with a spectacular view of the Tokyo Tower (which I suspect was due to my IHG platinum status).While headed to my room, I was greeted by several members of the floor's house keeping staff who inquired as to if I required anything to make my stay more pleasant. Once arriving in the room, I was actually impressed with the overall size and layout of the room. When the hotel staff arrived to deliver my luggage, I was again asked if there was anything I needed and if the room was to my liking.After settling in, I returned back to the lobby in search for something to eat for lunch. The concierge staff suggested I try the Cascade Cafe. Upon entering, I immediately noticed they were very busy with what appeared to be the business crowd also enjoying lunch. I had the choice of either the buffet or to order off of the menu, in which I chose the latter. I was greeted by one of the waitstaff members and immediately noticed that he seemed to be stressed by the amount of tables he had; which was also later evident by the poor service I received by this young man. I ended up ordering the carbonara pasta and two Japanese beers, which left me with a bill of about $40. It was pretty pricey for lunch, but I did enjoy the food.After finishing lunch, I decided to venture out into one of the business districts of Tokyo. The advice given by the concierge staff was absolutely wonderful and spot on. The concierge staff is really one of the main reasons that I really enjoyed my stay at the ANA InterContinental.Upon returning to the hotel, I decided to book an in-room massage. The options were either a 60 or 120 oil massage, or a 60 minute Thai massage. I opted for the 60 minute Thai massage which ended up running me well over $100. The massage it self wasn't bad, however the spa specialist who was giving the massage was not the most courteous. Approximately 10 minutes into the massage, her phone ragn and she began to carrying on a conversation try to booking another massage immediately following mine. She stayed on the phone for a little longer than five minutes and immediately apologized. This issue happened twice during the span of the 60 minutes.Upon check out, the front desk staff were extremely efficient and had me completely checked out in less than five minutes. When I walked outside the hotel, I informed a staff member that I requested a Taxi to take me to the Hamamatsucho train station and he ushered me to the taxi that he had standing by for me. Upon entering the taxi, the staff member informed the taxi driver of my destination and thanked me for visiting the hotel.Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here. It is VERY pricey, even for Tokyo standards. However, you will not be disappointed! Make sure that if you're not an IHG member, you sign up for the program at check -in. Doing so will allow you to dodge the $15/ day wi-fi charge.","Okinawa Prefecture, Japan","Z6580MOjoem</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Okinawa Prefecture, Japan</strong>",0,4.0

It's also located adjacent to the Ark Hills complex, which has an impressive selection of restaurants for any budget. For getting around, it's only a short (~1200JPY) cab ride from Tokyo Station. There is a subway entrance right outside the hotel, but it can be up to a 800m (0.5 mile) underground walk to get to the actual train. If you're trying to get to the airport, the airport's shuttle-bus has its last stop here, so it's nonstop to the airport after you get on.The rooms are a little bit worn, but still have a modern style. The rooms are spacious and feels very clean. It's not over-the-top luxury but it is certainly adequate. The hotel's most pleasant surprise is its rooftop bar. Even though the hotel isn't particularly tall (37 stories, I believe), it provides great views of the city.

It is not a five star hotel. Four star is fair. As usual in Tokyo, the management is made up of Australians and the workers are Japanese. Upper Management is very nice, as usual. Workers and middle management seem to nearly all have the ""Tokyo attitude"" that is short, less than friendly, somewhat lazy as they will not go out of their way to help and will tell a lie to get out of something they did do wrong. On this occasion the phone reservationist told me that the limo bus from Narita airport was to be free for our visit when we spoke over the phone the nite before. When we try to get this service at Narita, everyone tells us there is a 3,000¥ per person charge. I call the hotel and argue with them. I finally get a middle manager, that seems to be Serbian, and she tries to talk over me the entire conversation. The woman that told me the lie on the phone the nite before now denies she ever said free limo bus. (Apparently afraid for her job) The Serbian woman is excessively rude. I advised her I will speak to the hotel manager upon arrival. (This is all going on while the two rooms we have are going to cost me over $1,000 USD). We take the bus and pay the 3,000¥ per person for three adults and two children. A manager, Mr Shepherd, greets us as we get off the bus. Extremely nice young man. He personal checks us in an gives me a $30 price break for my problems. I just spent five times that for the smelly bus we just rode that was told to me was to be free, and, I am spending over $1,000 for two basic rooms at his hotel. Nice jester, but, not much of an offer. I needed assistance with an ANA flight change also. He said for me to come back down, after settling into our rooms, and the ANA staff will do this for me. I do, and he does. The young lady is totally full of herself and the ""Tokyo attitude"". She actually just dials the ANA flight agent and just gives me the phone. She said she does not do this for customers. I take care of the arrangements with the flights as the girl does nothing. During all of this going on, another lady comes over to tell me my wife is on the phone. It seems my Okaasan has locked herself out of the room. I am on the phone with ANA flight still. I tell the young staff lady what has happened and that Okaasan is 81 years old. She said to me ""she can just wait outside at the door for me, can't she."" I said NO. I ask that she get someone to go let her in. She reluctantly did go to another counter to ask someone to let her in. This is a nice looking hotel. Clean for the most part. (Although there is mold in the bathroom). It is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE for what it is and for what they give in ""service"".

Tokyo is a huge city and attractions flung across in all directions - having a hotel as well located as this was a blessing. There are many restaurants in the hotel - we tried the sushi one and it was quite good. The bar on the 36th floor has a great view of the city - you can even see Mt. Fuji from there! The staff was smiling and eager to help. It's worth appreciating that even though it's a chain hotel, the staff is mindful of Japanese courtesies and mannerisms.

You can go down a level for a few more seats, but, when meeting tour guides near the concierge desk or meeting friends for the day's outing, it'd be great to have more open seating on the main lobby area. There's a huge sitting area at the Atrium Cafe, but you have to order something in order to sit there. (The soft drinks were around 900 yen! Crazy when you could get one from a little shop inside the hotel for 190 yen!) 2) Yes, the hotel is located near a subway ENTRANCE, but you still have to walk quite a ways to get to the actual subway LINE. I only mention this because, from reading others posts, I was under the assumption that the line itself was very close. With that said, access to the Ginza line was great because we managed to stay mostly on that line for most places!All in all, we'd definitely stay here again, and I'd recommend it to others.",Louisiana,"Hniki234</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Louisiana</strong>",49,5.0

Slightly odd room service menus. I would not stay if not on business as very staid / no atmosphere in the bar etc. I recommend getting the airport shuttle bus (it is the first stop on the way from the airport) and much cheaper than a taxi, and easy to catch the shuttle back.

My recent stay at ANA Intercontinental is a testament of why exactly IHG is such a good brand and why I continue to frequent their business.This past New Year holiday my family traveled to Tokyo and decided to stay with ANA Intercontinental. We were a group of ten, which also included my grandmother who needs the use of a wheelchair to travel long distances. Even before we stepped in the hotel I experienced stellar service from their reservations group through Goro Takechi. Imagine the difficulty of booking multiple rooms of the same class on the same floor at the most competitive pricing during the peak New Year holiday. Goro and his reservation team helped make it possible for me to book the best-priced package that would accommodate our group.We once again enjoyed the fantastic service of the hotel upon checking-in when one of our rooms, not covered by the Ambassador membership, was upgraded. This was definitely a welcome surprise after a lengthy flight. Plus, my handicapped grandmother appreciated the gesture for our family. Thank you, So Hyun Park!

Unlike our home country or some western nations wherein New Year's is very lively, it was a very different type of celebration in Tokyo. There were no fireworks and a lot of restaurants close during this period. It was definitely interesting and a fun time to bond with the family. I credit the concierge team for enlightening us on these traditions. Ymke Simonis and Ai Mayanagi were amazing at assisting my family with restaurant reservations and logistical arrangements. Arranging meals for big groups in Tokyo can be a bit of a task, and doing this short noticed was an even greater achievement. We were able to rely on the concierge team for restaurant suggestions, as well as book places that we researched on our own. The restaurants in the hotel are quite note worthy, but in case you are on a tighter budget the general area of the hotel has a good array of choices. The hotel is also a short distance from Roppongi (Roppongi Hills and Tokyo Midtown) and the subway station is very ideally located. Coming from Haneda you can either take the monorail or a taxi and it takes less than 30 minutes to and from the hotel. So in addition to impeccable service, the hotel is also very convenient and centrally located.

Walking in it looked great and booking into our rooms was easy however from the moment we exited the lift the first thing I noticed was an awful musty smell, when we arrived at our rooms we had a bigger shock in store unfortunately. The musty smell was even worse in the rooms, the carpet was dirty and had hair on it and the bathroom towels had yellow bits stuck on them, yep that was a shocker. My friend's room was not better as her bathroom smelt like a sewer. We showed them pictures of the mess and asked for the rooms to be cleaned and this was basically a guy spraying the air. I could go on forever but basically we spent over 4 hours waiting in reception for our rooms to be cleaned and after all of that plus losing our first day in Tokyo as we had to wait for our rooms to be changed we didn't get an apology needless to say this is one hotel I will avoid on my next trip.","Cardiff, United Kingdom","Safia H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cardiff, United Kingdom</strong>",14,1.0

Our son and his partner were also staying in another room at the hotel and this was a family trip for the 5 of us. As the hotel was full the first night they arranged that we would change rooms for the last 2 nights and very kindly provided an upgrade to a traditional japanese suite room at no extra cost. Our first room was okay for 2 people but our suite for the remainder 2 nights was beautiful and we would definitely think about booking one of these in the future although I know it owuld be quite a bit more expensive. We had a beautiful view of Mt Fuji. THe hotel staff were very polite, helpful and friendly. We also visited the Club floor one evening which we would definitely pay to take advantage of on future visits. Great value, excellent food and lovely cocktails.

The hotel itself is very impressive in the public areas and is conveniently located. We were dressed casually for our entire stay as not there on business and I never had any of the service issues that other reviewers have mentioned. All interactions with the staff were good - I never felt that they were offering me lesser service than the business travelers. Check in and check out were very smooth, any time we called down to the front desk the staff were polite and helpful and room service was quick and friendly.Aside from ordering room service once we didn't eat in any of the restaurants but we did enjoy a happy hour at the champagne bar one night (impressive selection of champagnes) and every morning I got lattes and pastries from the little shop off the lobby - all of which was SO delicious. My favorite was the roll with bacon wrapped throughout, super tasty. I will go back here for breakfast on my next visit to Japan even if not staying at the ANA.There is a good size pool but I couldn't use it as was too cold out and the pool isn't heated, looks great for a summer visit though. The gym is spacious and has really nice, new equipment, definitely worth packing the gym clothes and working off the breakfast pastries...The only aspect of my stay that was just average was the room. To be fair, I was there on a corporate rate and had booked one of the most basic rooms so depending on the room you stay in the experience could be different. My room was a good size, especially for Tokyo, and was very clean. The bed was ok - all beds in Japan are too hard for me - and we couldn't hear any noise from the hall or outside so had no issues sleeping. It did seem like the room hadn't really been updated since the 80s but I wasn't bothered by that as overall it was in good condition. The two main drawbacks were the tv and the bathroom. The tv was a big flat-screen but was in an odd location on the left side of the bed in front of the window. So not only did it block out some of the light from the window, you couldn't really lay in bed or sit on the couch to watch it comfortably. Not a big deal as we didn't spend much time watching it anyway. The bathroom just felt really old - it was very small, had bad lighting and the shower wasn't great. Kind of feels like I stayed in a 4 star hotel with a bathroom you'd find in a 2 star motel. Other rooms may have more modern bathrooms though.Regardless, think this is a solid choice and would likely stay here again.","Tokyo, Japan","T_in_Japan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",64,4.0

The bathroom is great with 2 wash basins, separate bidet room and a shower room with a bathtub( with tv) and a standing shower that has great shower pressure.

It was advertised as mainly for business travellers with great conference and internet facilities. On arrival we entered the hotel through the conference area on the ground floor and had to travel up to the first floor/ reception area to check in. It was an impressive double height space which also contained a large dining area, bar, shops and office areas. Check-in was very straight forward although our rooms were not together as promised. When we brought this to their attention we were upgraded to executive rooms across the hall from each other. On entering our rooms we realised that we were on a smoking floor. The hallways smelt very strongly of smoke and nicotine which came through the air-conditioning system and under the door into the rooms. As we were only staying for 3 days and had already changed rooms we decided to live with it but regretted this when we started to get sore throats after the first night.The room was very clean and comfortable with a modern bathroom that had a large window between it and the bedroom space. The large mirrored wall in the bathroom was heated from behind so that even after a hot steamy shower it remained clear. The toilet was heated and had all the extras that you expect in Japan and the view from the room was beautiful, taking in the Tokyo tower.Breakfast was not included in the price so we paid for the buffet breakfast each morning which was quite expensive although I have never seen such a huge choice of dishes. It was available until 10am and was cleared away with military like speed, so don't be even a minute late or you'll miss it! The outside pool looked very inviting but at an extra charge of about £20 a day we gave it a miss.The Internet is only free to business guests but if you register with the hotel chains reward system online before you travel you can get round this and also use it without charge. Just take your membership number with you.The staff were very helpful and most spoke English and checking out was fast and straight forward. Taxis are always available and there are a couple of Subway stations nearby. I would recommend taking the Underground as it is very clean and straightforward to use but don't be fooled by some of the entrances as once you enter, it can take another 15 minutes of walking before you actually reach a train platform and after double hip replacements my mother found some of them a struggle.

However, I simply thought they could have performed better given their Intercontinental brand and the price I have paid for! 1) Room - The safe box in the room was not functioning well and so their staff literally spent at least half an hour fixing the safe box whilst I have just checked in into my room without having some time to relax. Turned out that the safe box could not be fixed but required to be changed into a new one, and there again spending more time in changing one.2) Washroom - it was user-friendly but could have been more spacious.3) Ambassador programme - I actually signed up for the ambassador programme meaning that I should have been upgraded to executive floor automatically (which was confirmed through email correspondence with the staff prior to arriving to the hotel) but I was told when checking in that they could not do so as all the rooms on executive floor were fully booked.

Facilities were very good and room was excellent as I would expect for a hotel of this standard.Price for the room was reasonably good value for money for the quality of the hotel service and location. However, I felt like the hotel was trying to make up for the good room rate by charging a lot for various extras.As a diamond IHG member I was a little surprised that the best they could arrange for a late checkout for me was 2 pm, and that staying to 3pm would be 30% of the rack rate extra, and 4pm 50% extra. (I was hoping to have a quick shower just before 4pm after some meetings.) Perhaps this is normal but it isn't what I've got used to with SPG or HHonors and the staff seemed a bit unfriendly about it too, as though they were doing me a big favour to even offer me paid late checkout.Likewise, when I checked in I was given an option for using the Executive Lounge. I didn't catch the price very clearly (my fault, I suppose) but said yes and it ended up being 12,000 yen ($120), which I didn't realise until checkout. Again, having become used to free use of exec lounge I felt this was rather a steep charge - though at least the lounge was very pleasant, quiet and spacious, so I ended up doing some work from there rather than in my room.Swimming pool looked inviting from the lounge, so I got changed and headed down for a 10 minute swim before heading for another meeting, only to find there was an additional charge of 3,000 yen ($30) for the pool, which the staff there told me I should feel thankful about since it was ""half price"" of the usual fee of 6,000 yen. At $3 a minute I decided not to swim - but felt quite disappointed since I had specifically chosen this hotel based on the pool looking good, and wanting to swim a few laps during my stay.","Odawara, Japan","MisterPugz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Odawara, Japan</strong>",138,5.0

When arriving I was impressed by the grandeur of the lobby and the greeting given by the employees. The check-in was straightforward and although it might take a couple of times to confirm things, due to English - Japanese translation, generally very good and always willing to help. Was offered an upgraded king bed room as the size I had booked was not available. I actually swapped with a colleague who was there with his wife and ended up with a twin bed, though to be fair the size of each of the twin beds were also very impressive. The room consisted of the normal writing desk, luggage area, Flat Screen TV, Mirrors plenty, coffee bar and minibar area, good sized wardrobe and small bathroom (though adequate for me). The bed was very comfortable and air-con worked well. The shower was powerful and all other amenities were very acceptable. What really makes the hotel stand out is the quality of the bars on the ground and 36th floor. The ground floor bar is very comfortable and relaxing and you can sit with a drink and smoke if you wish, as is the case with the 36th floor bar also. The drinks at both bars are not cheap, but you have to remember that you are in the middle of Tokyo and like any major city you will be paying more than other places. Great to use the ground floor bar (Floor 2 in fact) before heading out for a bite to eat and the 36th Floor Bar for a nightcap or two. The view from the 36th floor is very impressive and especially when captured between two verticals of japanese whiskeys which are great (Yamazaki 12 year old is one to try - or the Hibiki). My friend had a fish and chip supper in the 36th Floor bar when we met also and he seemed very happy with that. Its easy to get around from the Imperial Palace to/from the Tokyo train station, from which you can reach Narita airport in an hour on the Narita Express train, though Haneda airport is closer and I think will also come into Tokyo station. The hotel also sports a mini parade of shops, including a great little one tucked away for very reasonable priced traditional gifts for the family. There are some restaurants also to be located out through the shops. And in fact I just remembered alongside the hotel there is also a parade of shops and restaurants, which I did not get to explore.The Tokyo Skytower (mini tour eiffel) is also very nearby and on a good day you can see Mount Fuji from the 36th Floor Bar.One other thing is that there is also a champagne bar on Floor 3, which is just above the lobby floor and which you can see from the lower bar. Great if you can afford it, but we could not.All in all a great hotel which I very much enjoyed. It is not cheap, but from the large hotels we looked at in the similar area they are very similarly priced and again it is in central Tokyo.Take a look and enjoy.",Emsworth,"Gingamonkey1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Emsworth</strong>",42,5.0

Being an Intercontinental Fan, i scouted for the IHG properties in Tokyo and learnt that the ANA Intercontinental Tokyo is the biggest in terms of rooms in the world. So biggest it was to be and i land up at the Intercon to be warmly greeted by the hostess in a Japanese dress. Not sure what it was at that time, but felt very nice The hotel is BIG, really big. I entered the Lobby which was on level 2 and boy oh boy, the limousine ride unto the lobby was an experience onto itself. Rooms were clean, the japanese sakura touch and lovely flowers view from top of the hotel. My shower even had a TV and it was fun to soak in the tub while watching tv. Another high in life. I was there for about a week, and felt great. The best part is the view of Mt.Fuji from the Club Lounge and some of the rooms. How much more awesome can it get.......The Hotel is so convenient to reach by the train network in Japan (which actually looks like an electrical grid diagram) that i began wondering if ever people walked on the streets in Tokyo. If you are a walking buff, then this place is about a 20 minute walk from the Tokyo Tower. The rooms were very spacious, and yes the USP in Japan is the toilet. You have to see it, feel it, to believe it. Warm experience. Literally. The concierge needed to upgrade themselves, but then the GM of this property, Mr.Markus Platzer was a very cordial and gem of a person.

This hotel has a great club floor with really good food and wonderful views of the city. The club room overlooks the Japanese Prime Minister & Diet buildings. MY issues with this hotel are with the comfort of the beds and pillows. The beds are extremely hard. The pillows are either extremely soft or extremely hard with plastic pellets inside. Nothing in between for the firmness. I had asked on two separate occasions for a medium density down pillow and was given the same extremely hard pillows both times even after explaining the previous pillow would not work. I asked to talk to a manager about this and he listened to me and said “what do you want me to do about it?” When you’re staying in an almost $400 a night room and am a top tier member of their loyalty program, that’s not what you expect to hear and in my opinion you shouldn’t be treated in that fashion. I had to leave this hotel early because I could not sleep in these beds or with the pillow provide without pain. I ended up using a bath towel for a pillow to get some sleep, but very little. Unfortunately this was the worst sleep I have ever had at any hotel I have stayed at previously. That includes the budget business hotels in Japan.

Spacious, no smell. Windows sound-proof. Pool is relaxing. Breakfast spread was sumptuous and delicious. That a dated hotel building can be maintained and sustained after so many years is due to in no small measure to the Japanese team effort and culture to maintain quality. I have no complaints. At checkin, it was a little messy due to the peak hour but hotel staff soon came forward to assist. Their English was fine, and manners were pleasant consistent with Japanese hospitality.. I had stayed in many other Japanese hotels of around the same age, and I would give it 4.5 star instead of 5 star mainly because many upcoming newer hotels have caught up in infrastructure and décor.

We ate at the Tempanyaki restaurant on the top floor which was an experience! There are also great views of Toykyo Tower from the bar on the floor below. The executive room was spacious with good storage. Beds were comfy but pillows were hard. It is a 5 - 10 minute walk to the subway station for the Ginza line with other lines also accessible here. My only complaint is that they charge approx $30 PER PERSON to use the swimming pool!!

The lobby bar was nice and informal and the sky bar on the 36th floor was also good.Breakfast was, to be honest, a little bit disappointing for this grade of hotel. Buffet style and not very fresh with limited western options however plenty more choices so not a big deal.Hotel is very much downtown and is probably excellent for business users but we wanted to get out and find a little local bar and restaurant and it isnt really that sort of area unfortunately - cant blame the hotel for that.Lovely roof top swimming pool but why on earth must we pay Y3000 to use it as residents...

With Ambassador status, the check-in was very easy. We also had full access to the club level which was spectacular. The views overlooking the city were beautiful and the selection of food was always interesting with a variety of continental and Japanese cuisine. The pot stickers were the best I've had! The staff was extremely knowledgeable and polite and helped us from hotel. As it was my birthday, and my husband was attending business meetings, they even came out with a birthday cake and everyone sang happy birthday. It was above and beyond my expectations. They even arranged the best way to get to and from our planned locations. We travelled by Shikensen, Monorail, subway, bus and taxi (with taxis being the most expensive). All are easily accessed expectations. A special thank you to all the staff on club level, Junko Kano and her staff (Yuko, Kenichi, Seiki, Yuka, Kana, Mayuko, Sara and Ayaka) made our vacation a smooth and unforgettable trip.

If this was an Intercontinental anywhere else I would have been seriously upset at the room size. But in Tokyo the room size was actually pretty good. I stay in Intercontinental hotels a lot so I do get upgrades and obviously I expected something more impressive that I got.Apart from that rather lengthy negative comment for a relatively minor issue... The hotel was excellent and the staff were top notch. Had a bit of a problem with the Business Centre (arrived and there was a sign advising us to go to reception; went to reception and was told to go back to the business centre and someone would attend. They didn't. It took another trip to reception to get any assistance. The food choices were excellent (though this doesn't seem to extend to room service which was quite a restricted offering).

Sadly there are a few areas that let the hotel down: the smell in the bathroom of my room was awful - probably because of poor drainage from the wetroom arrangement, and not helped by poor ventilation. The room furniture (except for the bed) is small and the sofa is hard and not very comfortable as it has a low back. The food is just adequate - not as top notch as I had expected. The lobby restaurant buffet was mediocre and set up for snacking from bits & pieces - I didn't feel that I could create a coherent meal on a plate.

We chose this hotel because it was close to our offices and previous apartment. Also my future mother-in-law also stayed here for a few days in a different room. Her room was smaller and cheaper but still nice enough.The overall look and feeling of the hotel is nice, lovely lighting and ok perfume smell as you walk into the hotel. I'm a sensory person in this way and it is always a nice feeling of relief when I come back ""home"". The finishing looks a bit dated though; carpet is not very nice and the bathrooms in the rooms are plasticky and budget feeling for the price you pay.The staff try to accommodate and give good service, but seem limited in their problem solving ways until we went to someone who seemed like a Manager.For example, it took us three tries to check in due to some mixup with our reservation. We couldn't get a double bed, ok, sure, two beds is no problem. They then put us on a smoking floor (19th floor - even though it is a non-smoking room, it was very strong smoking smell...I mean we're on a smoking floor!). We asked to be changed to a non-smoking floor and the room (12th floor, I believe) looked like a downgrade, despite being the same ""type"" of room (smaller room, smaller 2 beds), which is pretty disappointing for the price, actually. We went down again, and being our third try and exhausted, went straight to a very polite manager-looking gentleman and he sorted us out right away with an upgraded room on the 24th floor, nicer view, one large bed for the both of us. The quality, space and room was noticeably better, but theoretically costed more than what we were already paying (and if we had to pay it, just doesn't seem worth it).Location-wise, it is convenient if you want to stay around Roppongi and your office is nearby. There are two stations close enough to walk to if you want to take the train to other areas, and taxi's aren't that painful if you need. A couple things that really bother me: * No sauna for women. It clearly states on their English website that there is a 24 hour fitness room and sauna facilities, yet the sauna apparently is only for men. I asked why and the lady at the front desk said for ""security reasons"" which does not make sense to me. It is false advertising and a huge disappointment, not to mention backwards and sexist feeling. Perhaps there is a good reason why this is, but they should have a better explanation prepared as to why.* Internet is not free and costs over 1600 yen for 24 hours. While our room apparently was included, it was not included in my mother-in-law's room, which I find silly that a luxe hotel like the ANA would make a fuss over something like internet. If we stayed at a budget hotel, fair enough, charge for any little additional thing, but internet at a very nice business hotel? =/* The pool is not free for hotel guests. It costs 3000 yen to enter the pool area for guests and 6000 for outside visitors. At least this is mentioned on the website but I would not bring a family here.Overall, it feels like a nice business hotel that is a bit dated and definitely overpriced for what it is (especially with internet being extra). You're paying more for location convenience if your office is nearby and a gym if you have time. I wouldn't stay here for a romantic or on a family trip (as taking any kids to the pool would be a ridiculous expenditure).","San Francisco, California","hybiscuskiss</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",25,3.0

Its location is fantastic -- close to Roppongi and Ginza -- and has few of the best restaurants (including a Michelin Star one) in Japan's capital city. But I will remember the hotel for a few small things which go a long way...1. I was in urgent need of a adapter for my smartphone charger. I expected that I will face difficulty in explaining the thing to the staff but lo! The lady in question not only understand what I wanted in a jiffy, I had the adapter in my hand within a few minutes. I was relieved because I needed to speak to my family. And the adapter was with me for the next three days. Thank you.2. I didn't eat at the Michelin-starred restaurant. But I had dinner at Karin, the Chinese eatery, and I can say I perhaps had the best dim sums and Sichuan rice noodles outside of China or Singapore. It was really really good. And I didn't pay a bomb.3. The breakfast spread at the fantastic Cascade Cafe was superb, one of the best during my international stays. But I would like to thank the staff at the cafe who always greeted us with a smile, wished us well apart from delivering some of the best sausages, hams, breads and desserts. The smile and greetings made our day.4. I missed my designated bus to the airport on the morning of my departure, though my luggage. The lady concierge assuaged me, placated my frayed nerves, put me on the next shuttle and told me where amd whom to get my luggage from. For an Intercontinental group hotel, it is more than expected that rooms, facilities and amenities will be excellent. What prompts people to recommend friends to stay and repeat stay are these little personalised touches.Thank you",Bangalore,"Chiranjoy S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangalore</strong>",26,5.0

Before my stay I had some issues with their online reservation system. According to the hotel staff, my reservation for two classic rooms (one for me and one for my parents) was confirmed, but whenever I checked my reservation online at the IHG site, only ONE of the rooms was confirmed and the other was CANCELLED per their central reservation system. Of course, I never cancelled any rooms. I brought this up with the English-speaking IHG customer service, and they kept insisting that I had reserved only one room instead of two. The Japanese hotel staff, however, always confirmed my reservation for TWO rooms whenever I called them. Unfortunately this issue was NEVER resolved before my check-in...the Japanese reservation agents on the phone couldn't understand that I couldn't find my reservation online. I got really tired going back and forth between IHG and ANA Intercon's hotel reservation staff, and decided that as long as I had the confirmation letters from the hotel, I would have those two rooms. For me, this issue was a really big minus because it showed a clear lack of communication between the ANA Intercon staff and the central IHG reservation staff. Thye should really work on this and not the guest burden him/herself with trying to figure out why their reservation isn't accurately reflected in the online system. Now for my actual stay. On the day I checked in, there was no problem whatsoever with my reservation. Lucky for them!!! ;) I was allowed to check in before my parents did, well before the regular check-in time of 3pm, which was considerate as I was exhausted from a long week and wanted to rest. The rooms were spacious and elegant, albeit a little dim even with all the lights on. My folks complained a bit about the airconditioning being too weak, but I found it OK. We all had a good night's sleep - great mattresses and linen. The bathrooms were very clean, although the fixtures were a bit dated. Nothing was lacking at all. We had the breakfast buffet at Cascade cafe in the lobby during our whole stay. Very substantial breakfast spread, although I think the Japanese breakfast wasn't a strong point. What we loved were the fresh fruit and veggie smoothies prepared every morning. My only suggestion for improvement would probably be the attitude of the staff at Cascade (the ladies in white uniforms, who were not servers). Sometimes they were slow to catch on to some of our requirements...that or their English listening skills were not very good. Other times they were standoffish and not as attentive as we had expected. A bit more fine-tuning is in order, I think! We ordered room service once and the staff who brought it to our room was extremely professional. The food was excellent too. If I would base my review mainly on my experience with their reservation system, I'd have to give them only two stars. Fortunately, our stay was very pleasant and we were overall quite satisfied! TIP: There's a small 24-hour supermarket (Seijo Ishii) in the ARK Hills complex of the hotel, should you get the munchies at odd hours. Good liquor selection, fresh fruit and microwaveable meals.","Tokyo, Japan","Jenina d</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",55,3.0

The staff at the hotel were very hardworking and the service was excellent. The laundry service was extremely expensive, but very well done. Restaurant breakfast buffet was very nice, and had enough variety to eat every day for two weeks. The only downside I experienced was that my room, while very modern and convenient, was quite small - only about 6 tatami-mat sized, plus a tiny bathroom. I understand that hotel rooms are typically small in Tokyo, but this was smaller than expected for a business hotel.

The rooms are relatively spacious by Japanese standards and very well turned out, all the facilities you'd expect and nice clean bathrooms. (Small moan the corridor outside the room was very warm, but the room was fine and the air conditioning no problem).The hotel has a wealth of restaurants, and if there isn't something you like in the hotel, and you don't feel like wandering too far then there are a good number of restaurants in the complex in which the hotel sits. There are also supermarkets and shops nearby.There's a fabulous roof top bar, and if you want to impersonate Bill Murray in 'Lost In Translation' it's great place to sit and watch the sun go down, and indulge yourself in the 'all-inclusive' cocktail special. Careful though, it looks great value, but after your fourth martini you will definitely decide that having a pizza (extra charge) is worth it!Breakfast is buffet style catering for most tastes, and is very good.My only complaint is the hotel's attitude to Wi-Fi. I think I should state my starting position that all hotels should provide fee Wi-Fi, or certainly those that are charging a few hundred pounds for a night's stay! My booking said that 'Wi-Fi was included' but I was informed when I checked in that it was not. There was an attempt to get me to upgrade my room, on the basis the Wi-Fi would be included, which I refused. I was eventually told that if I joined the Intercontinental Member Club (free to join) I'd be given Wi-Fi free. This I duly did. What annoys me is that the Wi-Fi was not included in the (fairly steep) room price, there was a transparent attempt to get me to upgrade and then a capitulation to sense and reason. Note as well that if you don't stick to your guns technically the charge for Wi-Fi is PER DEVICE, so if you are traveling with your partner both have a laptop and a smart phone or tablet, you could get hit for 4 (or more) charges. At the rate they charge that could be heading north of £50 per day!

Overwhelming excellent service from the staff the knocks out a few small challenges with the hotel.Positive:- staff service level is perfect. They are always available, always smiling, without being in your face all the time. Exceptionally polite. They made the stay. As an example, I wandered up the club lounge when I was exploring the hotel (but I was not staying in a club room.). The receptionist commented quietly that it was not very busy, and invited me to stay for breakfast. (And, by the way, in the future I would recommend a club room for access to this lounge. Very peaceful.)- central location for this part of Tokyo. Easy to get around, and for runners, there is a nice run to the imperial palace. About a 7-8 mile run round trip.- everything in the hotel worked.Areas that were not perfect:- overall, the hotel is old, and it shows it. It feels 1980s in terms of style, and while everything works, it is a bit worn down. It could do with a facelift.- the gym was odd. It was certainly small for a hotel of this size (and was quite busy.). On top of tut, the way it is set up make the gym experience feel cramped and a bit unpleasant. Really needs to be in a bigger, brighter space. This felt more like a ""check the box we have a gym"" type of hotel gym.I would certainly stay here again.","Greenwood Village, Colorado","Goldenbear96</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greenwood Village, Colorado</strong>",21,5.0

There are meeting rooms too but the hotel never seemed to be ""overrun"" by conference attendees. The subway station is close by for commutes. We did not sample the in-house restaurants.

I understand streets don't have names, and that there are lots of restaurants but you turn to a concierge to help provide guidance in these situations. Further, each time I had a question for the concierge, I had to wait while 3-4 other guests were ahead of me in line. Clearly understaffed.

The train station is a little far (about 15 minutes walk) so don't be fooled that the entry to the train station is quite close because you will be walking underground for ages. The location works because you are going against the peak flow of morning commuters so the trains were usually pretty empty. The hotel facilities are 5 star and our room had an excellent view of the city. Definitely more for couples than families.

Service is consistently first class, at all touch points. The little squeaks are things like the water isn't hot enough, and sometimes you can't get the room you want so you're sleeping on a double bed. But, dollar for dollar, can't really beat it if you need something of this calibre in a central location. BTW, I haven't tried the restaurants because there's so much stuff nearby - from fast-food to ramen, so step outside to save a lot of money and probably have a better meal.

I tend to prefer the Minato location over the Strings Shinagawa due to the location.The hotel property is located in Akasaka, and is very close to Roppongi and the ex-pat Azabu-juban area and of course the bars and restaurants of Akasaka. This is a large hotel with a variety of rooms. Its located in the Arc Hills complex so if you get in late, you can make a left out of the door and hit a good sushi bar 50 meters away. The complex has a few (though not notable other than the sushi bar) restaurants and there is a high end grocery next door where you can stock up on supplies.The hotel has a direct airport bus link so you don't have to mess around with the Narita Express if you arrive into Narita.The scope of the hotel is large including a big lobby. There is a nice bar on the top floor which is perfect for a smoke-friendly evening cocktail. The concierge team is top notch and the floor managers are also very good. I'm a repeat customer so I probably get somewhat better service since I know a few of the staff but I would suspect that they handle virtually all requests seamlessly.There are a variety of room types and especially in Tokyo, you get what you pay for. The standard rooms are very nice and big by Japanese standards but are nothing notable. If you spring for a better room you will get a better value. It depends on your willingness to pay, but this is Japan and nice things are expensive. I'm a good global Intercontinental customer so I get some type of an upgrade automatically. The Jr. Suites are worth asking for and/or buying. I'm attaching a panoramic picture - this room looks like something out of a James Bond flick. There are plenty of outlets and the work space is adequate. Plenty of decent water pressure in the bathrooms and of course the obligatory Toto automatic toilet. There is an elevated highway in front of the property, but the building insulation filters out the noise pretty well. The wireless internet connection works well. Top tier loyalty program members get it free, otherwise it's for pay. I do eat breakfast at hotels in Asia and the IC morning buffet is solid. It's on the higher end of whats out there and the room is large enough to handle the number of guests that use the restaurant. Subway stop (Tameike-sanno) is close.Overall the service level at the IC is extremely high and the concierge team stands out. If you chose the correct room, the combination of service, location and room quality is hard to beat unless you spend significantly more money.","New York City, New York","CS_NewYorkCity</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",49,4.0

Rooms are quiet and peaceful, so if you want to sleep in or get over your jet lag then you can close the curtains and you wouldn't think you were in the middle of Tokyo until you open them again and look out your window at the impressive Tokyo Skyline. On foot you can walk to the Imperial Palace in about 25/30mins, likewise the shopping area of Ginza. If your feet can't manage that, the underground is outside the hotel and both places are only 3 stops away. In the other direction past Roppongi you have Shibuya which is 'Tokyo of your Dreams'. Neon lights, the busiest trains station in Tokyo (probably the world) and the famous Shibuya crossing where you should pop up to Starbucks, buy a coffee and watch 1000's of people cross the road when the lights turn red. This isn't really walking distance, but only 5 underground stops away in the other direction. There is a brilliant food market at the bottom of the Station at street level offering Asian food delights. Make sure you are not hungry before you enter or else you will buy the lot!The leisure facilities at the hotel are top notch, but no indoor pool means swimming is a no go in the winter months. The gym area and spa are really good though. Overall the ANA offers everything you will need for an amazing stay in Tokyo. If it's your first time for pleasure or you've been to Tokyo on business before then you should definitely try the ANA, you will not be disappointed. It maybe one of the higher priced hotels on offer, but if you want the location, quality, service and good room sizes it's actually good value for money. Being part of IHG you can also claim your Priority Club points which is an added bonus.",,Tobe80,73,5.0

We booked one room for 2 nights stay (12/10/13 - 14/10/13) and another night on 19/10/13. The booking was confirmed. The first two nights were under “friends & family rate” since one of my friend is working for IHG group. This trip was a high school reunion trip for us with 2 from Sydney and the other one from Indonesia. We were supposed to meet in the hotel on 12/10/13 since we would arrive at different time. The facts are:1. One of my friends arrived around lunch time and found out the room was not available for us on 12/10/13. She couldn’t contact us since we were on 10 hours flight from Sydney to Tokyo. She was asked to be flexible by the GSM Manger since the room was under “friends & family rate”. He told my friend that we would be re-located to Metropolitan Hotel due to “urgent thing” happened in the hotel and I guess we were the “sacrificial lamb” for the convenience of the hotel!!! 2.She was offered breakfast complimentary for the day which finished at 11.30 a.m and she arrived after that! I am wondering whether they know the time! I actually wondered whether they know what they are doing!!! She ended up having lunch and paid for it.3.bShe was then offered the cab charges to go to Metropolitan Hotel and meet us there. My friend told the GSM Manager that we were on our 10 hours flight and there was no way she could contact us then. She has advised him that we would still be arriving in the hotel at night time and he needs to explain the situation to us in person! My friend then heading to Metropolitan Hotel.4. Two of us were then arrived after 10 hours flight and 1.5 hours trains to be told the same thing. “Please be flexible and we needs to be re-located to Metropolitan Hotel. We were standing in front desk having this conversation after long flight! I actually asked them to arrange 2 nights in Metropolitan Hotel instead of coming back and forth since we had tight schedule just to find out NO as an answer. We were asked for our flexibility whilst no compromise offered from the other party??? We were offered complimentary breakfast for the next day and club lounge access which we didn’t get a chance to use!! We were then took the cab to the Metropolitan Hotel.The issues which I considered as insults:1. The Australian GSM Manager told us to be flexible since the first two nights were under “friends & family rate” which were cheaper rate and he assumed we all work for IHG. Did he actually understand the meaning of “friends & family rate”? It doesn’t mean we all are working for the hotel, only one of my friends is!! I would expect a manager to know his working place and policy better than his hotel guests. He gave me an impression of we were the second class of guest since we paid cheaper rate! If the hotel cannot honour their offer, they shouldn’t have given the offer in the very first place!2. We were having this discussion in front desk at night time. Didn’t they think it would be much better to have this discussion in one of the private office? I think this is the very basic manners which all professional in service industry should know. I think the hotel should consider re-training its management team properly! I even feel an insult to write this thing and have to remember the whole bad experience!3. I then asked to arrange us 2 nights in Metropolitan Hotel instead of coming back and forth since we had tight schedule, which we were told it’s not possible. We were asked to be flexible whilst the hotel offered none! The hotel was quite a bit of distance and the room was very small.4. The most important thing was they could have email us notify the “urgent thing” and we then had option to decide!!! This whole bad experience could have been avoided which the hotel fails to do so! If the hotel does not understand this simple manner, then they don’t deserve to stay in the service industry, leave alone to be under 5 stars hotel.5. The GSM Manager should have come with more humble approach while notifying the bad news due to the inadequate of its hotel instead of keep asking us to be “flexible”. It is the hotel who fails to honour its promise not the other way round. I don’t think any of us deserved to be treated in this way.6. When we were back on 19/10/13, we were not receiving any good intention from hotel to restore its image as a 5 stars hotel. As a matter of fact, the GSM saw my friend and said “You are back, is there anything else I can do for you or help you?” I wasn’t there when the conversation happened, otherwise I would have replied “We are back not because of the cheaper rate or because we want to. We paid the commercial rate for the King Bed premier room. We stayed here again because we have made the booking and we are women of our words! We honour our promise and commitment. We say what we mean and we mean what we say. We are all professionals and we used to deal with professionals in a professional way.7.

We even got a bottle of Champagne sent up to us on our first day because it was our honeymoon.The location is good, with an exit of Tameika-sanno station on the Ginza line a very short walk away. Granted, it's then a long walk to the track once you're in the station, but there's a FamilyMart along the way which made supermarket shopping on the way home in the evenings easy. There was nowhere in Tokyo we struggled to get to from here, and we travelled about the city a lot.There are plenty of things in the immediate area as well, with Roppongi and Akasaka in walking distance and plenty of restaurants and bars. A couple of British pubs too, which suited us as we don't speak Japanese.The room we had was a king executive room on the 21st floor. The view was great, not very noisy, well airconditioned with a comfortable king size bed. Internet was free in an executive room, and easy to use. I guess a tiny complaint is that the benefits of the executive room we'd prebooked weren't explained on check in, so although we thought we knew, we had to call and check about the internet. We were a little confused, because we thought executive rooms all had TVs in the bathroom, and ours didn't. This is obviously something we weren't bothered about (didn't need the TV on at all while we were there) but it was odd that the website said we should have it.The only real fault with the hotel is the price of eating and drinking there. Food was very, very expensive, whether you ate in your room or the restaurants. We drank a few cocktails one evening, and you expect those to be more expensive anywhere, but other normal drinks were also very expensive. We had the breakfast buffet for a few days, which was alright, but so it should be at around £22.50 a person. At least it was better value than ordering a single breakfast meal, since you could have as much as you wanted.The price of hotel services is the only thing that would stop be visiting this hotel again. I genuinely thought it was a really nice place and enjoyed my stay. Just not so much the bill. If the dining was better value, I'd have given it full marks.","Scunthorpe, United Kingdom","helengriff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scunthorpe, United Kingdom</strong>",32,4.0

At that time the room was spacious and well appointed,and my expectations, probably far lower. For my second stay, this time around (September 2013) the hotel's age has really started show, especially in the design of the lobby and public areas. It just feels very 1990s or so - the lighting, the design, etc.I got a ""single"" room booked by my travel agent. Warning - in a number of places this just means single occupancy in a regular room and hopefully you can get a king bed. In this hotel (and in other certain countries), this means a much smaller room (my mistake). You get what you pay for (I did get a special rate). So my room was very small as was the bathroom, which didn't have a fan, or much room to ventilate, so things got steamy when I showered.Bed was comfortable, a queen size and the room adequately appointed. Service was nice, check in was swift and smooth. Breakfast buffet was just fine. The bar at the top of the restaurant affords a great view of the city and the bar tending staff is kind. A bar on the second floor is tended by my Yoko Ariga, who was recommended to me by a cocktail specialist bartender in Hong Kong where I live. I was unfortunately unable to try her drinks as I had shorts on and there is a dress code for the second floor bar - though I plan to next time! Location is the key. It's close to a number of subway stations, a short walk from Roppongi, near the US Embassy as well as a number of businesses and there are lots of little restaurants, bars, and cafes near the hotel so that one can explore a fair bit.","Hong Kong, China","Jamoldo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",41,3.0

There was a 300 person line for cabs arriving 3/hr (don't worry, this is NOT typical - only after holidays with typhoons). Anyway...called the hotel to see if they could help. Not a chance. They would not call a cab company nor provide names of companies I could call. I even called back a second time to make sure I did not misunderstand. Nope...they were not going to help in anyway.

This situation probably will not happen to you but I feel as an international traveler I want a hotel that can be my go-to resource.

Second strange thing was the usage of the pool, which costs 30 USD(!!!) for a five star hotel where I paid using advanced saver tariff already €200 for a room (Tokyo Bay was €140 and although they don't have a pool, the Lounge access is included - see my related review to that). Nevertheless we went up to our room (alone) and were really satisfied with the view over Tokyo Tower and that the room was quiet large and clean (besides the floor which came a bit in the ages and had some sort of different dirt on that).Upon making us comfortable in the room we wanted to arrange our Limousine transfer to Narita Airport for the following day (which is 3.000 Yen and runs till 16:30 and I found it comfortable). Once at the Concierge desk I asked if we could make a reservation and they said everything is fine, and we could pay than at the reception. I wanted to pay in cash since didn't want to keep my Yens with me and went to the reception saying that I want to pay our transfer for tomorrow now if possible.

I have never felt such an arrogant answer from a receptionist although have stayed already in a few hotels in the world.I definitely would give for this the terrible rating but since the room, the view and the rest of the staff was kind they get the poor result (I can't give any better since the pool is not included and this I can not accept for a 5 star hotel).All in all it was an experience staying here but as said in the title I would rather take the Intercontinental Tokyo Bay.","Dusseldorf, Germany","Lasze85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dusseldorf, Germany</strong>",49,2.0

However, shortly before we were to depart Australia, my elder daughter was hospitalised and placed in inteive care due to having developed a chronic case of pneumonia that required her to be placed on life support systems and remain in the Intensive Care Unit of Royal North Shore Hospital for 3 months.Obviously none of my family travelled overseas that year. Unfortunately I had not renewed our travel insurance by the time my daughter became ill.Nevertheless, I received refunds from the various airlines and other places that we had booked including some bookings that I had made with the IHG Group in London (Crown Plaza, St James) . I was initially told by IHG's reservations section that as I had pre-paid for the ANA accommodation, I would have to write directly to the ANA Hotel management and request that it provide a refund as it was not legally bound to do so given the terms and conditions that apply to pre-paid accommodation bookings. Indeed the lady from your international reservations office with whom I spoke doubted if I would get a refund.I nevertheless sent a letter to the ANA management explaining my family's position. Not only did I receive a full refund but I also received the most heart-warming message of good wishes for my daughter's speedy recovery and a wish that she would be well enough to one day travel and stay with all of my family at the ANA. That message (from the Senior Room Reservation manager, H. Iino) deeply touched every member of my family and our many friends who I have advised of such a warm and wonderful response.After 6 months of rehabilitation my daughter greatly improved. We decided to therefore travel to Europe last year to visit her younger sister who was an exchange student during 2012 in Italy. Because of the wonderful gesture of the ANA Hotel in Tokyo, not only did we make sure that we stayed at that hotel (where we booked 2 rooms on our homeward journey) but we also decided to stay at your other Intercontinental Hotels in Rome and Berlin.Therefore, Mr Iino deserves a wonderful expression of gratitude. I also should add that when I made the booking at the ANA Hotel in Tokyo last year, I received considerable assistance from Mr Goro Takechi who also deserves praise.Their respective acts of selflessness have not only touched the hearts of my family, our relatives and friends but has lead to many of them deciding to stay at your hotel group and for a number to also become Intercontinental Ambassador Members - including Victoria Sewell and one of my friends from student days, Mr Greg Kelly, to whom I refer in the following postscript. Each of them also made their own reservations at Intercontinental Hotels around the world last year, with Mr Kelly having stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel in Chile late last year and Victoria having booked (& stayed in) rooms at the Adelaide, Rome, Berlin and Tokyo Intercontinental Hotels during the course of last year, in addition to the rooms that I also booked.It has been remiss of me for not writing earlier to express my gratitude to Messrs Iino and Takechi. However, the lateness in doing so does in no way diminish my gratitude or the sincerity of my appreciation of what was done for us by the staff at ANA Intercontinental Hotel in Tokyo. As stated above, all Intercontinental hotels have benefited from those gestures of sympathy and understanding.The stays at all those hotels were special.

If you look at things in absolute, then the pluses are that it is central, easy to get to from airport (bus), and handy for most visiting business people. But if one considers that the price is five star, and paying for what one would expect from a global chain like Intercontinental, then you will be dissapointed. Those who travel often, who've stayed at other Interncontinental hotels, and who expect premium service and ammenities for a premium dollar (yen), then I'd suggest keep on looking. It is obvious that this hotel is on a cost cutting campaign, yet haven't cut the charges. As a long term visitor to the ANA Intercontinental, I doubt I will stay here again. Sad really, as it once had a great charm.","Sydney, Australia","PrugueMac</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",45,2.0

An entrance to the “Tameike-sanno” and “Kokkaigijido-mae” subway stations is located just outside the hotel, this is exit number 13. Note that there is no elevator at this exit, just an escalator that is mostly running in one direction (upstairs). If you are travelling with suitcases and want to make use of an elevator, I recommend to use Exit 11 instead of Exit 13. This exit is located just a 3 minute walk across the road from the hotel and is quite convenient. Note that those exits are nowhere near the subway, the closest platform (Ginza line) is at about 350 m walking from Exit 13 while the farthest platform (Marunouchi line) is at about 1200 m walking; inbetween those two platforms are two other platforms (Namboku and Chiyoda lines) as well. Altogether, most major landmarks can be reached by one of these four subway lines either directly or with at most one transfer. The connectivity from this hotel thus is excellent. We arrived at Tokyo Haneda Airport from our flight from Osaka. There are numerous options to get to this hotel from Haneda Airport but the, by far, most convenient option is, in my opinion, the airport limousine bus (from the company Airport Limousine Bus) since the bus just drops you off right in front of the entrance of the hotel. The bus ride from Haneda International Airport to the ANA Intercontinental Tokyo takes approximately 45 to 60 minutes to complete, depending on traffic situations. A single journey ticket will cost you 1100 JPY, which is reasonable in my opinion. There, however, is one big letdown and that is the frequency that this bus runs: it just runs four times a day which is really scarce. You thus just have to be able to catch the bus otherwise you are dependent on one of the other options of travelling to the hotel. Tickets can be bought at various points in the arrival lobby (at the first floor) of the airport and bus stops are located outside the arrival lobby. There are many options to travel to Narita International Airport as well. You can either travel by subway, train or bus. A train ride using the Narita Skyliner from Ueno station will cost you 2400 JPY, and then you have to travel to Ueno station by subway as well. You can travel to Narita Airport by the Airport Limousine as well, but this will set you back 3000 JPY; one pro is that is runs more frequent that the one to/from Haneda Airport. The hotel offers a shuttle bus, which runs quite frequent, as well but this will set you back 3000 JPY as well, I actually guess that those two buses are the same. Even though the hotel mentions that it will cost you about 3000 JPY, regardless how you travel to the airport by public transport, there is, however, a much cheaper option to get to Narita Airport which saves you about 1500 JPY. There namely is a Keisei train that runs from Shinbashi station to Oshiage, as the Asakusa subway line, and onwards all the way to Narita Airport. These trains depart at .07 and .47 past the even hours (e.g. 10 am, 12 pm, 2 pm, etc.) and at .27 past the odd hours (e.g. 11 am, 1 pm, 3 pm, etc.) from Shinbashi station and are either Access Express or Airport Limited Express trains; however be sure to check Hyperdia.com beforehand to verify your train departure. The trip from Shinbashi station to Narita Airport will take about 70 minutes and will cost you 1280 JPY. You can get easily to Shinbashi station by taking the Ginza line from Tamekei-sanno station, which will take about 5 minutes and will cost you just 160 JPY. Total will thus be 1440 JPY which thus saves you 1560 JPY compared to traveling by bus or Keisei Skyliner while travelling time is about the same. Transfer at Shinbashi is rather easy as well. Accessibility of the hotel from both airports in Tokyo area thus is excellent and quite convenient. Since Tokyo has such an extensive subway system and most needed transport in Tokyo can be done by subway, I recommend buying a PASMO card for simplifying the mass transport in Tokyo. PASMO can be purchased at one of the ticket machines at a subway station. PASMO can be used for the above described journey to the airport as well. The hotel is located in the Akasaka district of the Minato ward. This district is full of offices and accommodates quite a lot embassies and most government related buildings (it hosts various ministries as well as the prime minister’s official residence). The district thus is quite quiet and relaxed, since there aren’t that many tourists in this district. There are various convenience stores and supermarkets (7Eleven, Fresco and Lawson) located at a walking distance of the hotel. Quite a lot coffee shops (Starbucks, Doutor, Tully’s Coffee, etc.) and some restaurants are located in the direct vicinity of the hotel as well. Plenty of the above mentioned stores can also be found at the underpass towards the Tameike-sanno station or at the ARK Hills complex in which the hotel is located. Shopping malls in the Roppongi district (Tokyo Midtown and Roppongi Hills) can either be reached by foot (about 1 to 1.5 km) or by subway. The close location of the hotel to the subway station, shops and restaurants thus makes the location of the hotel excellent.We arrived at the hotel around 03.00 PM, which was check-in time as well. Upon arrival our suitcases were directly taken by the bellboy and an employee welcomed us and walked with us towards the grand lobby. She kindly asked how we were and when we queued for check-in she asked whether we were a member of one of the IHG loyalty programmes. When we replied that we were she directly took us to the Guest Relations desk and she checked us in by herself. We thus were helped directly and didn’t have to wait in the enormous queue at the front desk. The woman checked our reservations and verified our preferences. Check-in took somewhat longer than usual but this was because she wanted to give us a good room that fit our preferences. After about 15 minutes we were checked-in and she handed us our keycards. Furthermore she mentioned that we could make use of the internet connection throughout the hotel free of charge, which will otherwise cost you 1575 JPY for 24 hours per device, since we were Priority Club members which was very nice. I think this is rather expensive for internet access and I even think internet access should be included in every stay or should be available at a much lower fee. During check-in she was very polite and kind. She even directed us to the elevator, of which there were four; there were four other elevators as well which would take you to the executive rooms and swimming pool. In order to get to these areas from your room you thus have to change elevators at either the lobby or at the 21st floor. The lobby was enormous and is really spacious. There is many seating space in the lobby, furthermore there are some small shops and a business center as well. There was such a nice scent in the lobby as well, I loved it. In the evening music was played in the lobby and you could enjoy a drink there. We booked a Two Bed Classic room and, since we are with three persons, requested an extra bed. The room was about 30 square meters in size and featured a desk, two armchairs, a side table, a LCD TV with plenty of international channels (CNN, BBC, etc.) and a closet, which also featured the safety deposit box. There was a minibar corner in the room which featured of course the minibar, some snacks, some miniature liquor bottles as well as a water dispenser (which can either be switched to cold or hot water). Instead of distributing complementary water bottles to hotel guests, housekeeping completely refilled the water dispenser every day. My compliments for that. The hotel provides you with some thermal glasses as well, which are very nice in my opinion. The room featured one air conditioning unit of which the settings could be adjusted in numerous ways. In contrast to some other reviews on Tripadvisor which mention that the rooms look rather dated, the rooms don’t look dated at all. The design and furniture is quite timeless and neutral and don’t give the feeling that it’s there already for many years. Rooms were quiet and neighbors or people strolling through the corridors could not be heard, which is a pro as well. The view from the room was okay, it was not that special, our room faced some office buildings. I think we were lucky that our room didn’t face the highway which is running in front of the hotel as I think this can be quite noisy. Wired as well as wireless internet is available, at a charge, in all guest rooms; wireless internet is available throughout the whole hotel. The availability of wired and wireless internet is of course a plus, however, as mentioned before, the charge for using the internet is way too high which is obviously a con. It’s a pro however that Priority Club / Rewards Club members can use the internet for free. The internet connection was quite stable and internet speed was good as well. Since the plugs in Japan are different from the European plugs, the hotel offers free converting adapters; this is a pro as well. The beds were a little bit hard but were okay to sleep on. The linen was good and was replaced by housekeeping whenever you place a particular card on your bed. Each bed featured two pillows, just a regular one filled with feathers, which was too soft for me. The second pillow was filled with feathers as well but had a central area which was filled with kernels, this pillow was extremely comfortable and is definitely worth a try! Housekeeping was good and the rooms were cleaned and restocked properly each day. Since we were a Priority Club member we received a complimentary newspaper each day, which is a pro as well. The bathroom was quite spacious, and thus offered quite some personal space, which is a pro to me. In the length of the bathroom a large mirror covers the wall and a marble countertop with a sink is put on the wall. There is a typical Japanese toilet which is equipped with a bidet with an extensive range of options to clean the backside, which is a big pro. There is also a bathtub with a shower in the bathroom. The shower was okay, but a little bit low for a tall European guy like me, which is a minor con. Amenities provided by the hotel are excellent, the bathroom was stocked with many different towels as well as a small amenity kit for each guest (which featured a toothbrush, shaving kit, etc.). The bath and shower amenities (shower gel, shampoo and conditioner) are provided by the famous Japanese brand Shiseido and are superb, they smell really good and plenty of amenities are provided in dispensers which are refilled by the housekeeping. There was plenty of room in the bathroom to dry three towels, which is excellent. A con is the fact that the bathroom looks quite outdated in comparison to the room itself. The bathtub, tiles, floor and toilet just look old. If I check the pictures of the Executive and Premier rooms I see that the bathrooms in those room look more contemporary and new, so I assume the hotel has updated those. Maybe they will update the (bathrooms of the) Classic rooms as well…in my opinion this should be done since the bathrooms look quite old fashioned.As mentioned before there is a small shopping arcade at the lobby level of the hotel which features numerous shops. There is a business center at this level as well, which can provide you with various services like internet, printing, copying, etcetera. There is a ATM at the lobby level as well, this ATM, however, does not accept cards with the Maestro or MasterCard, which is a con to me since I expect from a large hotel chain like Intercontinental that, if they provide an ATM, it will take all cards. Note however that many ATMs (except the ones from Citibank and at post offices) do not accept Maestro and MasterCard cards. The fitness center and the hotel pool are located at the fourth floor of the hotel. The fitness center looked very modern and nice from the outside and can be used free of charge as a hotel guest. The hotel pool is located at the roof, and features a major con which is the humongous fee of 3000 JPY per visit as a hotel guest. I think it is ridiculous as a hotel to charge the guests (almost 30 EUR) just for swimming, in my opinion this should already be included in the quite expensive hotel rate. Opening times of the hotel pool are rather limited as well, just from 10.00 AM to 07.00 PM and only in summer season (end of June till half September). I understand that it isn’t reasonable to go swimming in the winter but I assume that it will be nice to take a dive in spring or autumn as well, which isn’t possible in the current situation. Maybe the biggest pro of the hotel is its staff. The staff are so kind and helpful but stay polite at the same time. The staff always greet the guests and try their best to help the guest with any inquiry. Whenever you’re in the queue, either at the front desk or at the concierge, a staff member will come by and ask whether he or she can help you, the staff is really pro-active, which is a big pro to me. Another big pro is the concierge service of the hotel. There are mostly two staff members at the concierge counter, which will give you any information or tips about Tokyo and are glad to help you with your inquiries. When we asked for the location of two airline offices they immediately searched the internet, called to the offices and gave us directions, which is superb. One minor con is that there may be some queues at the concierge desk at some times when various guests have inquiries at the same time. I think that two concierges may be too little at some times. Since we left early in the morning for our flight to Seoul and we were a little bit scared of long queues for check-out, we arranged an express check-out the day prior to our departure. So we paid the bill the day before departure and we had just to hand in our key cards the following morning. This express check-out was quite quick as well, thumbs up for this. So, to wrap up: this is an excellent and spacious hotel with good rooms and a superb service. The staff at this hotel is its main selling point and the biggest plus, the staff are so kind, polite and pro-active. While the price/quality ratio may not be that high (due to the high room rates), it’s definitely worth to stay in this, good located, hotel. There are however some cons at this hotel, which makes that the rating of this hotel will be 4 stars in my opinion. I, however, would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel!Pro’s:+ Good location, close to a subway station with 4 lines+ Easy reachable from both airports in Tokyo region+ Plenty of convenience stores in direct vicinity+ Extremely friendly, polite and pro-active staff + Very good concierge service+ Spacious rooms+ Cleanliness of the room+ Good linen+ Excellent pillows+ Quiet+ Free internet for Priority / Reward Club membersCon’s:- High charge (1575 JPY / 24 h) for internet connection for non-members- Beds are a little bit hard- Bathrooms (of Classic rooms) look rather dated- Ridiculous charge (3000 JPY / visit) for a visit to the swimming pool- ATM that does not take Maestro and MasterCard cards- At sometimes there is not enough staff at the concierge counter","Haarlem, The Netherlands","HJB93</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Haarlem, The Netherlands</strong>",197,4.0

If this is your home for your first visit to Tokyo it will suit you quite well as the staff is extremely helpful and multilingual and the hotel has a plethora of places to eat and drink. The rooms are a typically small and depending on what you get can have a good or somewhat awkward layout with the placement of the bathroom and bedroom. The rooms are a little dated but still extremely clean and generally well appointed. We personally thought the bed was a little uncomfortable compared to another Tokyo hotel we had just stayed at. The views from the room are better higher up -try to get above floor 20 and the higher the better. Below 20 the view can be OK to GOOD but not the nice skyline views you get from the higher rooms which have some redeeming value. The service as a separate note is some of the best I've experienced. Everyone is extremely polite and the front desk is literally amazing. I had somehow managed to mess up the arrival and departure dates and despite being nearly sold out on a night I needed to stay they quickly figured it out. In addition the representative who checked us in seemed to have a deep concern for making sure we were taken care of which was very nice.Normally I would give this hotel an Average 3* but the service level puts it at 4*. I think as a ratio of price to quality it's average, if it was cheaper it's easily a 4* or 5* but it could use a little updating on the furnishings and general appearance of the lobby. It's still a very good hotel by standards of cleanliness and overall accommodation. If you have time be sure to try the MIXX bar on the 35th floor as the views especially as night or on a clear day are fantastic.","Pasadena, California","thebigcafeteria</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pasadena, California</strong>",7,4.0

I also found it to be good value for money as I got an attractive corporate rate - much cheaper than other hotels in the area that are far worse in terms of quality.

It's also within walking distance of several bars and resturants (more as you go towards the Roppongi area, which is within walking distance or one stop away on the metro). From my perspective, the best thing about the property's location is that it is in a more quite area, though you don't have to go far to find the hustle and bustle of the city. You can't really complain!Rooms - The rooms were very clean. Dring my first stay I was in a ""normal"" room and during my second stay I was upgraded to an executive room. The executive room was recently renovated, but was smaller than the room I was in during my first stay. Both were nice. In general, the bathrooms are very small. Also, I should note that the AC worked really well. Service - Top notch...friendly, efficient, etc. when I arrived for my first stay, they gave me a smoking room by mistake. They quickly changed my room when I discovered this and were extremely apologetic. Room service was delivered quickly and it was to a high standard (note: I never tried the resturants or bars on site). General - The wireless works well, though you have to pay for it. There is an outdoor pool, it's easy to get a cab at all times and the rest of property is just as clean / well maintained as the rooms. Finally, all of the staff spoke very good English. In the end, I would stay at the ANA again.

The Room:We were situated on the 29th floor and had breathtaking views of the city. Especially at night. The room itself was quite small but the use of space was very good. The room had everything we needed including a traditional foot massager. Service: Housekeeping and in room dining service was great. The bed linen were always changed when we left the card on the bed and the towels were replaced regularly. the room was always fresh and inviting. In room dining was always prompt and food was very delicious and hot. Portions were a little on the smaller side considering the price. Unfortunately there were a couple minor things that placed a bit of a hinderance on our stay. 1. We en-counted an incident were I was asked by staff to go back to my room and change as a result of me wearing a singlet to the buffet breakfast. I didn't think twice about my choice of attire as we had a jam packed day of tours and sightseeing ahead of us and being summer it only made sense to wear something cool. And must I add, I wore a singlet twice before this incident happened and was not told about the dress attire. Was a little annoyed to have to go back up to my room and change. I wish this was sometime we were told about upon check in. 2. Upon arrival we were advised by the man at the front desk that there was a 1 off fee for the use of the hotel pool of $30 AUD (Which I think is ridiculous, the first and only hotel ive stayed at were you have to pay to go swimming) and then we could use the pool facilities at will. Incorrect information - upon my second visit to the pool I was advised by the staff that I had to pay again, to which I explained the information I was given from the front desk. eventually I was let in and given complementary access to the pool. I didn't use the pool for the rest of my stay as a result of this. 3. last but not least. we were charged for our stay twice. When we arrived the hotel took the money out of our account and held as per usual hotel procedure (Which we were more than happy with) upon checkout they charged us again. which put us out of pocket approx $3000 until the money that the hotel held, had been released back to us 3 days later. VERY VERY annoying, especially when that effected the remainder of our second stay in bali. Tokyo is an amazing city and we thoroughly enjoyed our time and stay at ANA. would definitely stay again.",,Shayne K,1,4.0

Ideal location close to two metro stations (Roppongi-Itchome & Tameike-Sanno) for getting around Tokyo and its sights, We arranged two visits, one to Nikko National Park (Complex of temples and Shrines dating back to 8th century and one to Mount Fuji (returning by the bullet train). Used location to visit other areas of Tokyo, Imperial Place East Gardens, Ueno Onshi Park, Toshogu Shrine to name a few. The hotel is only five minutes walk from Roppongi which is the centre for night life and numerous restaurants.

I was amazed at how welcome I was made to feel. The hotel staff, across the board, were polite, respectful, and incredibly accommodating. I never realized I was missing some portions of a top notch service experience until I stayed at the ANA. They did things to stage my room that other hotels do, but don't do nearly as perfectly (clean up, arrange, set out, etc.) This property was spotless and well cared for.

The gym is small but has the necessary basics. The only thing that was not ok at all is that hotel guests had to pay 35 dollars a day to use the pool. The reasoning behind it was that otherwise there are too many people at the pool..... weak reasoning and I understand that the pool needs control but not in that way with such a high rate. Furthermore, in todays technology, I find it also silly to charge for the use of the internet connection.

There is a mix of leisure and business travellers, as well as flight crew as this is an ANA hotel so the lobby sets an ambient of both luxury and comfort.The room itself was spacious (gorgeous for Tokyo standard), living room had blu-ray player, large working desk, well-stocked minibar and room was well lit. Their duvet was heavenly, I believe you could order one home if you wish to. The location of the hotel is a pity, as it is indeed a 15 mins walk until you reach the train platform, but the nearest underground exit is only 2 mins walk from the hotel. The only thing I can complain about is that they're doing it too perfectly, it lacks the feeling of being in a foreign country. If you're looking for that awkward language barrier when asking for a wake-up call, it wouldn't happen; they all speak fluent english.","Hong Kong, China","mcwai</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",70,5.0

I was definitely not impressed. The first impression is good, the hotel is well connected with both airports and the lobby is nice. However, at check-in a very rude Japanese employee showed me a totally negative anti-gaijin attitude. I booked the hotel through a very famous web site, and set some preferences (such as non-smoking). I was told that a room as I wanted was not available, or it was but with a $60 supplement per night, as the preference setting was non-binding. The attitude of the employee made me feel to leave the hotel at once, but the situation was saved by another employee (not from Japan, this time) that in a flash found a room, supposedly according to my preferences.I spend around 200 nights/year in hotels, since almost 10 years, and this is the first time I had such a bad experience at check-in. The room was modern - in the eighties, maybe. Very cramped for that level of hotels (New Otani, Hilton, Sheraton, I mean ...). There was no place where to put my suitcase, just to tell you. The bathroom was tiny as well. As I minor detail, I couldn't find any English channels on the TV, and the channels did not correspond to the printed notice, where the usual CNN, BBC etc, were listed. Breakfast was decent but not exceptional. Oh, and Internet is $15/day. Enjoy. Overall, a disappointing experience. In Tokyo for the price I paid there are much better options. Definitely, will not recommend.","Juan-les-Pins, France","krotas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Juan-les-Pins, France</strong>",70,2.0

The hotel itself was almost perfect. We had a good sized twin room for the two nights we were in Tokyo. We didn't try the restaurants or gym, but apparently they are of a good standard. We had access to free wi-fi which is a huge plus. They DID ask for 100 yen to print out two boarding passes, but 100 yen is nothing, so it was a minor (really minor) trifle.

That was certainly the case at the ANA Intercontinental Tokyo.We arrived stressed. Our flight arrival time from the UK meant that we'd missed the hotel shuttle bus and there wasn't another for two hours (we got this on our return trip and it was excellent) so we travelled in to Tokyo on train and subway - which was first class and SO clean compared with the UK. However when we arrived at our station we had to walk underground for 10 minutes with our luggage until we re-emerged - thankfully to within 100 metres of the hotel.On checking in however the hotel did not have what we booked - a double interconnecting with a twin. I have friends who can stamp their feet in these situations and get an instant upgrade, I however can't do that effectively clearly as I had a 'groundhog day' conversation with an incredibly polite but not completely multi-lingual receptionist who constantly went back to her manager to reappear with the same message - they did not have what we had booked.We went to lunch in the hotel while they tried to rethink the situation. The first restaurant on the ground floor - an open plan buffet affair - told us there was a 40 minute wait. Stress levels rose. Only one restaurant on the floor above had space for us, and thanks to a very calming manager, a private space and a reasonable burger (not our first choice but hey) we started to relax.On checking in for a second time the manager apologised profusely for not having the rooms we had booked - he could only offer us two interconnecting twin rooms but would push the twin beds together in one (albeit in front of the wall fixture containing the bedside table, severely reducing our space to walk round the bed and making the room look a mess). However in return he gave us complimentary use of the executive lounge on the 35th floor during our stay.What this brought us was complimentary breakfast in the lounge each morning, cocktails and nibbles early evening and coffee of an evening when we returned to the hotel after dinner, free wi fi and fantastic skyline views of the city.I haven't calculated the saving this brought us during our stay, but it was certainly worth the inconvenience of having a scruffy double room!We'll definitely be returning to Tokyo, and to the ANA Intercontinental - only this time booking Executive Rooms with access to the Executive Lounge!Importantly, the hotel is in a great location - there are wonderful restaurants in Roppongi which are walkable (and which I have reviewed separately) and the staff after our initial check-in experience couldn't have been more helpful.","Bath, United Kingdom","WriteInBath</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bath, United Kingdom</strong>",18,4.0

I think where some of the negativity comes from is that we often get so spoiled with 5 star hotels in Asia. Or one sometimes expects 5 stars out of an Intercontinental property. This is not a 5 star hotel. On some websites it is listed as a 5 star property and on some websites as a 4 or 4.5 star property.

The hotel reserves these perks based on room reservation type, not status. Seriously? The breakfast is nice, but expensive ($35 USD) per day. Many companies receive a breakfast discount decreasing the amount to about $20 USD so you may ask for that.

It offers a very nice balance of luxury, location and service at a price much less than some of the premium hotels in the area. The lobby is spectacular with large glass panels with cascading water. It was a great place to relax or visit with friends. As with many Tokyo hotels, rooms were on the smaller side but modern and very comfy. We especially liked the toilet with a heated seat! We never heard noise from the hallway and our city view was very nice. I suggest you book a rate that includes breakfast. It is one of the largest assortments I have seen, and you could choose breakfast or many lunch items as well. I especially liked the juice bar, and they always featured a different ultra-healthy juice made in their Vita-Mix. Croissants were as good as anything I've had in Paris. While available separately, the price is somehow easier to handle when mixed in with the room rate.;Staff were friendly and tried to please. We used the services of the concierge on many occasions, and each we spoke with were helpful and made great suggestions. There is grocery store steps from the hotel which is very handy if you need snacks or beverages. The hotel does not offer any of these items onsite so it was a very handy option. In room wi-fi was very fast, although you have to sign in each day, a minor inconvenience. There is a subway stop steps from the hotel and we mastered it pretty quickly. The concierge was also a great help in teaching us the ins and outs of using this very large and very busy system. Overall, a great choice whether visiting for business or pleasure.A note on getting to and from the hotel: We chose to use the high speed Narita Express to get to the hotel faster,, but the decision on using this versus the airport bus depends on a personal choice. The bus is slower and may be affected by heavy traffic but goes door to door, while the train requires you to take a cab to and from Tokyo Station.","Atlanta, Georgia","Reldim</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",87,5.0

Nevertheless, it was a solid hotel, and would recommend it to others, if it were within their price range.We were also on the 20th floor, and I believe that level 19 is a smoking floor, so, a little smoke must've seeped through to level 20 via the air conditioning vents, which made things a little annoying.

The good: The foyer and F&B offering are truly ""Asian 5star"" The house restaurant was great with outstanding breakfast (highly overpriced but hey this is Tokyo so I won't mention the cost of food anymore). One of my greatest memories in this hotel (and Japan) happened at MIXX bar lounge. As a solo traveller, I took my camera and book up to the top floor lounge at happy hour. I was so immersed in my book that a very polite and friendly Jarek (Bar Manager) came to me and say: With all due respect, put your book down and look out the window - the sun is setting over Mt. Fiji - the weather is always overcast so this is a very rare sight - enjoy it (and here's a complimentary drink). WOW. Not only was the view amazing but the service, seriously.... Apart from that, reception and concierge were always polite and appropriate. The hotel is located on an awfully business-focused area of the city, near all embassies and prime minister residence. Its adjacent to a metro station (you actually walk 1k or so to get to the platform though but thats ok).The Bad: I had a tiny tiny room. Ok I booked the cheapest but this was seriously small. 1-2 nights would have been ok but for 5 it became very claustrophobic. Looking at the evacuation map, I could see that this was the only "" Harry Potter Cupboard""-like room in the floor. To paint a picture, all minibar items were in front of the television as there was no room for a proper minibar display. The bathroom was also quite dated (very dated) and in need of a refurb. The bench tops were made of cheap marble-lookalike plastic...I also found speaking English to the staff a little challenging at times but I am an opened traveller so thats ok - I imagine busy executives to be a little more short tempered.

The immediate viscinity offers a few restaurants in Ark Hills but the greater selections of Roppongi and Akasaka are just 10 mins walk away. The lobby is cool and opulent, if a little retro and the hotel bars and restaurants are good, though pretty much uniformally high-end. Only the Cascade cafe is a bit of a disappointment - quite expensive and mediocre in its breakfast selection. The gym is small but brand new and reasonably equipped and the outdoor pool is a rare treat in Central Tokyo in the summer. The rooms are generously proportioned for a hotel in this location (larger than the equivalent, though more expensive, Grand Hyatt) and in good order if a little blandly furnished. Staff are extremely pleasant and very willing to help wherever they can...but this is Japan so should be taken as read. If anything the service here is a little pared down from that seen at very high end options, for example you will be finding your own way to your room, but that is ok.Overall I rate this hotel highly. I have visited Tokyo tens of times and this is where I choose to stay on business and for pleasure.

Tip: if u go across to the next building (through a bridge on 3/4th floor) there are quite a few places to eat. haven't had anything there so i don't know the quality of the restaurants. however, i recommend that massage place in the complex, it's really good (u know it's good as asahi tv's office is on the other side of the complex). i got a special deal and it was 12000 yen for 2 hours, which i think was pretty decent.",london,"mitmit0401</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>london</strong>",24,3.0

The receptionist said we would have to change rooms after the first night as we had used points for the remainder of the booking and this meant a standard room not a king. I argued this was ridiculous as we were platinum members and would expect an upgrade on the room - as a standard perk so changing rooms was completely unreasonable especially at a rate of 50,000 points per night. I was told that they were doing me a favour checking me in at 1pm instead of 3pm when as a platinum member this would be standard practice. Resolution required me asking for a manager and then common sense prevailed allowing us to stay in the same room for all 3 nights whilst waving under my nose the priority clubs highlighted rules for standard rooms or reward bookings.

It is worth travlling to this hotel by the airport limo service whoch is located at the airport desks upon coming out of arrival. This is a bus service which takes around 1.5 hours to get to the airport from Narita and costing around (3000 Yen= £25). I did notice that taxis are super expensive in Tokyo, unlike many other asian cities so it is best to take buses and undergroend to get around Tokyo. The hotel itself was chosen as we wanted to be near Roppongi area for the weekend. The loaction was bit further out than we expected, requiring at least 10min taxi ride, which equates to £15-20 taxi ride. However during the day time, there are 2 cose underground stations nearby. The hotel lobby is very impressive and the room is of a large size, espically by Tokyo standrads as I was about to fond out later. We went to Kyoto after a few nights stay here and our 2nd Tokyo was much smaller. The hotel room decor was nice apart from the toilet which was very average with a bath and a shower, albeit with a powerful shower. The bed was large and very comfortable. The rooms was very clean, much like most of Japan I suspect.The major negative I didnt like was the wifi charge which for 2 nights was 3000 Yen, which I thought was quite steep, espically considering many other similar hotels wouldnt charge for this.

The weather was amazingly humid although the temperature only read 95 degrees F. Every short trip out of the hotel left us drenched in sweat. We began to enjoy the local customs: paper fans and small hand towels to wipe our faces and necks.Hotel: beautiful and clean hotel well situated for seeing the main sites of Tokyo. The check in was easy although slow and inaccurate. We were checked into a room with a full sized bed - my husband's 6'3"" frame hung off the end of the bed. We we called to report this they arrived with ""bed extenders"" to attach to the end of the bed. The man attaching these devices realized we were booked into the wrong room - we were supposed to be in an Excutive King Suite. After and hour or so we were moved to the new room (a long wait with jet lag after a flight from Denver). The new room was the size of a traditional US hotel room with a sparkling clean bathroom (the housekeeping service was perfection!). Watch out for the slippery tub - nearly fell many times!Workout area: always clean and cool with the best water in the hotel (we fill our water bottles every day at the cooler to take with us into the humid city). Hotel Restaurants: with just a week in Japan we were careful not to get stomach issues. We didn't understand the local foods or language well so we decided to try the local favorite foods in the safety of the hotel. Yes, like other reviewers said, the restaurants were very expensive but we didn't mind paying for the safety those restaurants provided. Also, the food was incredibly delicious. We tried Sushi for the first time at Sushi Kenzan. It was a very intimate setting (at the bar with one chef serving us - he was a wonderful, knowledgable dining ""companion""). The conference my husband attended provided sushi but none was as fresh and delicious as the Sushi Kenzen. The chef said they also have a restaurant in NY city (worth looking for!). Also, we ate traditional noodle bowls at Karin which is supposed to be a chinese restaurant. Again a wonderfully delicious meal in a beautiful atmosphere. Finally, we skipped the buffet because it just looked like way too much food. Instead we ordered curry off the menu at the Cascade Cafe. At the take out bakery, Pains et Gateaux, we had the freshest croissants and pastries we have ever had (including those we ate in Paris)! Watch out - these pastries are addicting! Finally, we had a business reception and dinner at the top of the hotel at Teppenyaki Akasaka. The food was fabulous: small traditional japanese dishes of sushi, tapas and desserts. Beautiful view and they provide menus with a map of the surrounding buiildings.Breakfast: we saved money by going to the Natural Food Grocery store (a short walk toward Roppongi). We bought yogurt, granola and milk for our coffee to store in our big refrigerator in our room. Also, I brought from the US, Starbucks instant coffee packets so I could make the morning coffee in our room (the room is stocked with coffee cups, spoons, sugar, large refrigerator and teapot).Concierge: wow - not enough adjectives to describe their incredible service! We arrived in Japan a few days earlier than the conference to enjoy our 20th wedding anniversary. The concierge made reservations for us at restaurants that ususally require a reservation months in advance. They were always ready with a full description of transportation services, ideas for fun, and advise - using their IPADs to show us pictures of their descriptions. NIce, nice people who are willing to please!Swimming Pool - too expensive for our tastes so we didn't use it.Transportation: the ""Airport Limosine"" was the best way to arrive - they are located at the airport with an efficient queue and accurate arrival and departure schedules. We walked up to the desk near the baggage claim, bought our tickets and waited in a specific line for about 15 minutes for our 1 hour ride to the hotel (this is a Greyhound style bus but very clean and comfortable). On our return to the US we made a reservation through the concierge and the bus arrived at the hotel and took us straight to the airport. The subway has multiple stops around the hotel. WARNING: I, a woman, was in the middle of ""people pushing"" in the subway - a horrible, inhumane experience! Athough the subway car was full, they pushed an additional 25 people into the crowded car. There was a large collective groan and a wave of men came toward me. I turned and braced myself - holding my arms out to brace against the wall. As the train moved and I had men completely jammed against my back and sides, I noticed a man next to me with his face and chest crushed into the wall (he was moaning slightly and the skin on his face was drawn tight against the wall). When the door opened he was thrust out in front of the crowd (all this humiliation and stress while he was just trying to go to work!). Hint: while on the subway keep yourself in a location where you can physically carve out a space for yourself - bracing against a wall worked well for me. All this happened around noon, not even rush hour! Next time I'll look harder for the all women's car. Overall, a wonderful trip and much of this was due to the beautiful ANA Intercontinental Hotel!","Boulder, Colorado","278Sunny2105</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boulder, Colorado</strong>",33,4.0

However this is Tokyo, so we accepted that high prices and small space were the norm. The furnishing / decor was still IC standard and pleasant, although the bathroom was not really comfortable (stand in bathtub shower, very tight on space).However over our short two night stay other things started to weigh down the experience. I went down to use the pool, and was told there was a 3,000 yen (USD 38) charge for hotel guests to use the pool! What!?!

Train is from Tokyo station and not very convenient if you have to carry luggages. in the end took a taxi to the TCAT terminal (costs 40 usd) and took the bus, another 40 usd.. Japan is still not easy in terms of airport and access. ANA needs to get a bit of a warm touch and flexibility to its great service. I would probably not stay in ANA because the internet costs 20 usd a day. its not a big amount but don't think anyone should be charging for internet anymore.",Dubai,"rizmyshariff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai</strong>",14,4.0

So I would like to thank the following, Junko the Club Lounge Manager and Yuko the Assistant Chief, Yuji and Sonoko. The club lounge is going through some changes, there is no more champagne, which is a shame as it was really nice to be able to sip on bubbly as an option while admiring the views from the lounge. I think management should rethink about bringing back the champagne. Initially we were given a nice Club King room but the washroom was very small with one sink for 2 people. The hotel staff kindly gave us a suite with a larger washroom and more room for 2 people. I was also informed that there will be no more Club Access for Royal Ambassadors which is a shame really as that is one of the draws for us to this property as well as the staff.

I much prefered the previous cafe. Oh, and the artwork in the hotel used to be of regional asia artists, but now is more modern and doesn't give the ambience that you are in Asia.

No problem if you're alone like a third of the crowd -- the lounge tends to be busy and you won't stand out.I can't comment on the club floor rooms as the hotel gave me an upgrade to a Japanese-type tatami mat suite with 2 low-rise Western style beds. It looked like a zen temple. The original upgrade was to a executive suite but these were fully booked during my stay and the hotel apologized for the ""downgrade.""

This may be a reflection of traditional Japanese levels of high service and hospitality, but it any case I found the hotel to be very welcoming.The hotel is situated in centrally in Akasaka, usefully its the first stop for the airport limousine bus service making it easy to get to and from Nirata airport. I didn't find much in the way of shops nearby, there are many mini-supermarkets for essentials, a small high end shopping mall behind the hotel and a Starbucks and a couple of cafe bars if you fancy a change from the hotel.All in all, I found my stay here very pleasant.

The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet despite being on a busy highway. The gym was nice and open 24 hours. Internet was free and reliable. My one complaint was checking in. It was very slow because everyone arrived by bus from the airport at the same time. I suggest the hotel consider a way to speed up check-in for large groups of people since this must be a common problem. And, after a 14 hour flight and 90 minute (awful) bus ride to the hotel, I was left to carry my own suitcases to the room. This is the first time in years of traveling that I was simply left at the elevator and no one took my suitcases to the room. Again, I think this was probably a result of such a large number of people arriving at the same time, but a hotel of this quality should find a way to accommodate this.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","bethpindc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",361,4.0

The best thing about this hotel was the air-conditioning - it really functioned well and were really cool~ any frequent visitor to Japan knows that most hotels don't equip with strong air-con and that usually makes the room very stuffy.The biggest problem had to be location. There were 2 subway ""exits"" nearby but they were only ""exits"" not actually close to stations. We had to walk 10 mins underground to get on a train. Walking to Ropponggi takes 20-30 mins, no major shopping/restaurants nearby. Airport limousine buses for this hotel leaves airport every hour (unlike the ones for Shinjuku / Shibuya which leaves every 1/2 hour), so if you missed one you have to wait for a long time. So if you're there for business I think it's fine, but for shopping and having fun, this is definitely not the place.

The location was really what sealed the deal for us when we tried to decide on where to stay. Firstly, it's the dropoff location for limo service from the airport, which makes things a lot easier for us. The fact that it's only 2 minute walk to the metro station with connections to 4 major subway lines also helped (although it does take another 8-10 minutes just to walk from the metro entrance to the platform.)The interior design of the hotel was a bit dated but we found the atmosphere to be quite comfortable. The room was spacious in Tokyo standard though a bit noisy at night since it faced the front of the hotel where there were a few overpasses connecting Roppongi to other parts of the city. The bathroom especially the bath-tub has definitely seen better days and could sure use a facelift.It was disappointing to find that there's no Wifi available in the rooms but if there's any consolation, there was a network cable there just in case you have a laptop computer. If you are using an iPhone/iPad, you can try what one hotel staff suggested to us - stand real close to the business center and try your luck connecting to the Wifi there. We tried our luck but no cigar.There were many nice restaurants in the hotel, ranging from Chinese, Japanese to French but there's a hidden gem at the corner - the pastry store by Pierre Gagnaire. Pierre was best known for innovative French cuisine but we were surprised to find that his little pastry store offered a nice variety of cakes at very reasonable price.

The bamboo foot massager a nice touch and the showers excellent. The Elemis products are some of the best I've had in hotels. The massage chairs on the Club floor were also very welcome.I was a little disappointed with some of the costs. Use of the swimming pool is a rather exorbitant Y20,000 per use and whilst gym is included in room rate, this is extra. For the business traveller who maybe wants a 30 mins swim before work, this is off-putting. Indeed, after being stung once, I declined to use it further. This is a shame, as its a large pool and had hardly any users when I visited. At the Hilton in Shinjuku this is included for example. I was also not impressed at having booked a King Executive room yet finding out upon arrival breakfast was not included. It certainly was not clear from the website that this was the case. The result an extra Y3,600 per day. Considering this does not include a full hot breakfast (no baked beans/runny scrambled eggs/ tomatoes etc) I felt this was a bit steep. Although I appreciate Tokyo is expensive, these elements prevented the hotel getting a top rating. There are not that many reasonably priced restaurants in the area. I would advise hopping on the metro to Shibuya, Meguro or Ebisu.

They happily obliged a cot for the baby and had no issues with our 5 year old sharing our bed (many hotels are strict about the number of people per room). The room was very pleasant - not large when compared to rooms in Indonesia or Thailand but large for a Tokyo hotel. The bathroom was great, if on the small side. The shower was fantastic! The bed was enormous - much larger than a king size. The room was serviced multiple times throughout the day (well it seemed like it as the bed was always made) and turndown service was available each night. A complimentary gift was there on our arrival. The rooms were quiet and the electronic curtains blocked out any morning light. We left the curtains open at night for a great view of the city lights.The Club Intercontinental lounge was fantastic - perhaps the best lounge we have ever used. The staff were helpful, the food and drinks were fantastic. With a 3 star Michelin chef in the hotel, how could the food be less than brilliant? Even with our noisy, messy little ones, the staff were super nice. The wifi and laptops available for use made researching our daily destinations very easy. The lonuge was very big and the Arne Jacobsen-Fritz Hansen 'Egg' chairs made a very comfy rest stop after a long day of sightseeing.The pool was great - the small kid’s pool was a hit with the little ones. The hotel is seconds from a Tokyo Metro exit (Ginza line etc) which made getting around Tokyo very easy. This station had lifts, which was great with our pram. The Akasaka area has many fantastic restaurants and bars if you want to eat out - just head towards the Akasaka-Mitsuke station and you cannot go wrong. Keep in mind that it is a lot quieter on Saturday nights as the Akasaka area is popular during the week with the politicians and bureaucrats that work here.

BUT: one should not expect the “you think it and It happens even before you ask” kind of service of other Tokyo hotels in the same class.In addition to this stay at the ANA Intercontinental Tokyo, I’ve spent extended periods of time in Tokyo at the Conrad, the Hilton, and the Tokyu Shibya. The Ana clearly comes third in terms of service and overall product of the four and fourth in terms of value for money – comparing corporate rates all around.While most staff of Tokyo hotels provides you a distinctly personalized experience and generates the feeling that they would love to have you back, the ANA staff – with the exception of the reservations person – seems to be afraid of their costumers or annoyed by their guests. They clearly had some favorites, maybe long term stayers or very frequent repeat guests, but starting from the check-in experience where none of our personal information had made it from the frequent stay profile or the reservations correspondence into the room records, to the daily struggle to get a table for 5 arranged for breakfast, to the check out process nothing really went above and beyond and out of the box solutions are clearly not part of the repertoire. Same for taking any interest in building the perception of a personal relationship, we weren’t greeted by name throughout the entire almost two weeks of our stay, nobody cared to ask what we were doing, nobody cared to ask when we were planning to have breakfast in the morning so that a table for 5 could be arranged, even after a week we were still stopped at the entrance of the lounge area and asked for our room number.The breakfast itself, ranks third of the three places that I enjoyed breakfast in the lounge. A 100% self-serve all prepared deal, not even a hot beverage served by staff and nothing cooked to order. Same deal for the short two hours of appetizers and bar in the evening.Overall, the lounge product is more what you would expect from a similar place in NYC – sans the rowdy crowd – than any Asian offering. Though I have to say that the fellow guests were a very pleasant kind; no shouting into their phones and only the occasional American who seemed to feel that the entire Club needed to know about their intimate life or the details of their latest deal. Others have already mentioned that the pool is a place with a big likelihood of getting nickel and dimed or at least surprised: loungers and water were initially included in our package until the day when without notice the policy changed and we were asked $12 and hour for it.Finally, although it’s the first stop on the Narita Airport Bus, don’t bring too much luggage, as 1. you are on your own with the luggage at the door step of the hotel – bellmen service only for those who arrive by car (in a country that runs on public transport!) – and 2. room space is very limited, especially storage space. Be absolutely certain to read the floor-plan information very carefully and to picture clearly if those precious few square meters are enough space for you and your money – third smallest footprint of the four hotels mentioned above, on par with Tokyu.","Minato, Japan","Finke</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minato, Japan</strong>",57,3.0

The location of the hotel is excellent for both access from/to Haneda airport (about 30 minutes drive in Tokyo traffic) and also for my office in Ropponggi.I have previously stayed in the Grand Hyatt Ropponggi Hills (which is my favorite hotel in the world - and whilst more expensive is a significant step up from the ANA in my view).Anyway, check-in was (as usual in Japan in my experience) polite, effective and fast. The room (on a high executive floor) was also excellent and had fabulous views over Tokyo. Very spacious room and very clean. A good selection of toiletries, and a powerful shower - overall the room and bathroom were very impressive, if perhaps starting to feel a little dated and tired.I was in town when the earthquake and tsunami struck the NE part of Honshu. Obviously the shaking in Tokyo was quite severe (I was in the work office at the time), but on return to my room later in the evening you would never have known anything was amiss. Everything was perfectly in place, and it is obvious that someone had been in the room to correct everything before I had got back to the room later that same day. Impressive indeed given the number of rooms that must have had the same treatment in the hotel that day.One thing that did rankle with me was my access to the executive lounge. Given my flight was delayed by about 18 hours due to the quake, I would have thought I would have been allowed to use the executive lounge even though I had checked out - but no such luck. Still - a lot of others were much worse off, so I shouldn't complain I suppose.Overall the hotel feels just a touch dated now in my opinion, with places like the Grand Hyatt and the Park Hyatt relatively close by for ready comparison, and therefore I would probably pick those above the ANA, though the ANA is quite a bit cheaper of course.Overall though, I would recommend.","Hong Kong, China","Worldworn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",60,4.0

The air conditioning worked PERFECTLY (I like it cold.. especially in a very hot and humid Tokyo Summer!). The bathroom was well appointed and the shower had great pressure and temperature. The room and bathroom were extremely clean! The hotel was extremely quiet and very convenient to both Haneda Airport and the Tokyo Subway. The concierge happily made a reservation for us at several restaurants and when we arrived, there were no problems. From Haneda airport, we took the Tokyo Monorail to the last station for 470 Yen per person. The taxi ride from Hamamatsucho to the hotel is roughly 1200-1400 Yen. We did the reverse on the return and it was really smooth and reasonable. I believe you can also take the 'airport limousine' which is basically a bus, but there are only 3 pick ups/day.The hotel is located right next to the Tameike-Sanno Subway station (Follow signs for Exit 13 when you arrive at the station which is a walk from the turnstiles, but all underground)All in all, it's a great choice for Tokyo.","Houston, Texas","TechMarauder</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",193,4.0

The location is central, and transfer to and from major transportation hubs (plus both international airports) is exemplary. From check-in to check-out everything runs like a well oiled and efficient machine. This level of service, hardware and location does come at a very steep price, though. Overall, there is nothing 'wrong' with staying at the ANA Intercontinental. Nevertheless, if given the personal choice (I was booked in for a corporate function) I would not come back to this hotel since it simply is nothing more (and less) than a big, impersonal business hotel. Don't get me wrong here: ANA Intercontinental is doing everything one usually expects from a 4-5 star business hotel predictably right; but nothing really strikes as impressively ""above expectations"" in terms of attention to detail and customer service. Frankly, when demanding the prices the ANA Intercontinental does, it is not enough in my opinion to just do things in a correct and efficient way. At this price level one simply comes to expect a true luxury hotel experience, which goes beyond being merely efficient and business minded. This ultimately includes making every guest feel not only welcome, but treated with utmost attention to detail and a very highly customized approach to service - a friendly smile here and there also does help a bit. ANA Intercontinental unfortunately falls quite short on this account , and thus does not register in my book as a true luxury hotel. If you choose to stay here, you will certainly not regret it, but you most likely will forget your stay the moment you walk out the lobby doors.

The restaurants are expensive - there are several restaurants, which provide a lot of options if you want to stay in the hotel, but I have at least one bill that I am not going to submit for reimbursement, the meal was just too much.3. The hotel has a gym, but charges 1,500 JPY for use.

The rooms aren't particularly spacious (a vast different from my experience in the one in Bangkok!), the bed was very comfortable and it had all of the comforts and conveniences we needed. Overall, everything felt like it was a high-end 4-star hotel - so still good but not necessarily what I'd expect from a luxurious 5-star.However, the day after we arrived, the 8.9 magnitude earthquake hit northern Japan and as Tokyo felt the effects (as did we while walking down a street and watching buildings shake like leaves in the wind, in fact!) and it was really after this experience that the hotel showed its mettle as a great establishment. While pretty much all of the people we encountered during that difficult time were kind, polite, calm, courageous and just so incredibly civilised even while their country was going through a tragic disaster, the staff of the hotel were all those things and just went above and beyond what we expected. As we returned that first evening after the quake, the lobby and taxi queue were bursting at the seams with stranded guests and what I can only assume were other people who had found their way in (the whole city was stranded with public transport cut off and traffic completely chockablock). The hotel staff were calm, efficient, helpful, and really made great efforts to make sure absolutely everyone was being tended to, both in the rooms and the lobby and beyond. Water was handed out to people for the next several days and other small comforts were a very thoughtful touch.While we woke up to the sound of the building eerily creaking as it swayed slightly during the strong aftershocks, and there were a couple of cracks in the wall (and a small one on our room ceiling) the building had strong foundations and the hotel only had very minor damaged. We felt very safe there despite the uncertainty of what might strike next. Room service was as speedy as they could have been under the circumstances and adequately tasty. Mostly though, it's the concierge that would have us coming back here. Extremely helpful and patient, all of the concierge staff we encountered were exceptional, both before and after the major quake hit, impressing us in both an ordinary and an emergency circumstance. Location wise, with a city like Tokyo it's not easy to say what's plainly good and bad since it really depends on your tastes and what kind of area you'd like to stay near but if you're looking for something near Roppongi and/or Ginza, this is in a great location and within easy walking distance of a lot of spots. There's also nearby subway stations so even if you do want to go further around the city, it is an extremely well-located hotel that's convenient for getting around and seeing the city. While I'd like to 'shop around' for other places to stay next time I'm in Tokyo and just experience some other places as well, I would be happy to stay here again. The hotel itself was nice and nothing to complain about, it just wasn't anything special to us - the concierge, however, was and if I ever stay here again that'll be what I'm looking forward to again most!","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","partypiglet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",13,4.0

The thing is that Tokyo sybway system is quite complicated, and sometimes it's quite a long walk from the entrance to the subway system from the street to the actual train. So if you're taking only DISTANCE under consideration the nearest station is Roppongi Itochme. But the nearest ENTRANCE to the subway system is for Tameike Sanno / Akasaka.

Also be mindful that Narita Airport is extremely far away from the city, so when leaving for your flight out of Tokyo, allow at least 3 hours prior to your departure - regardless of whether you take a bus or the N'Ex rail system. The subway takes almost 90 minutes from Tokyo station (which is approx 10 minute taxi ride from the ANA Intercontinental), and the Airport Limousine Bus Terminal is at least 1 hour 20 minutes (and 20 minutes taxi ride from the ANA).Tokyo is a great city and the ANA Intercontinental is a fantastic place to stay!","Melbourne, Australia","MC-7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",71,4.0

Regrettably, I don't know, therefore I cannot give a full-fledged recommendation. As usual, The Good, The Not-so-Good, and the BadThe Good1. Check-in process. Fast, very welcoming, informative and professional. What you would expect from a nice property.2. Bed comfort. King size, firm, selection of pillows (be sure to pull the one out from the closet).3. Room size. I stayed on the Club Level, and found the room to be of nice size, even more so because being in Tokyo. Not huge for 1 person, but large enough that I was very comfortable. Had embedded desk, embedded couch, good size closet, safe, clothes drawers, mini-bar...4. Room lighting options. Lovely control panel next to bed that allowed me to control lighting throughout room, establish alarm clock, open/close window shades, etc. And it was simple to use. Well done.5. Laundry/shoe shine service. On time and well done. Had early flight out and asked that my shoes be back at 06:30. I think my watch said 06:30:10 and my doorbell rang. Excellent.6. Bus service to-from NRT. While I assume this is not owned by ANA Intercontinental, they allowed for me to place return trip on room bill which I greatly appreciated.7. The gym. Decent size. Equipment in good shape, both cardio and weights. Open 24 hours.8. Level 35 - The International Club. Offered as a room upgrade and was basically a half-floor utilized as a breakfast/relaxation room with nice views. Room had a wide assortment of chairs, couches, tables, etc. where you could both work and relax. Nice touch with massage chairs. Breakfast offerings were limited but fine. In evening, had wine, beer, etc.The Not-so-Good1. Very musty/mold like smell in my bathroom. I noticed immediately upon entering the room. I had to keep the door closed, and make no mistake - it was each day. Did I complain? No - because I typically vote with my wallet, but it's regrettable the housekeeping staff could not realize the unpleasant odor and either fix the issue or alert management.2. Late one evening my 3 colleagues and I went to the bar on the 37thish floor. It was fairly quiet so we grabbed a table along the windows, only to have an employee inform us there was a 1000 Yen table charge. I laughed and we left. I understand table charges are common in Tokyo. But, we are all on the Club Level, we're all Priority Club members and likely to have a few rounds. They lost business that night and potentially more to come. I informed the employee what I thought but received no solution. It was not the amount (which was reasonable), but the principle that we were hotel guests - and premium ones at that.The Bad1. Housekeeping Training Program. Undoubtedly, if the housekeeping staff had been trained properly, they would have alerted their bosses of the musty smell of my bathroom. Cleanliness scores ""poor"" because of the consistent must bathroom odor. I do not highly recommend this property - unless the smell in my room is an anomaly.","Budapest, Hungary","JeremyBudapest</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Budapest, Hungary</strong>",145,3.0

The room was quite small, but very clean, fairly comfortable and pleasant. The bed was a little hard and the overall space was tight, but this is Tokyo, so I was not surprised. We were in Tokyo for food, art and relaxation. This hotel is very well set up for business travellers and I could see giving it higher ratings and a more glowing review if the hotel were more fun or my trip purpose were more business oriented. We received an upgrade to club level, which I would always recommend at Intercons that offer it for the great added service, snacks, drinks etc. The club is comfortable and quite business like, but you won't feel out of place in casual attire. Service, as you would expect, from front desk to housekeeping, to restaurants is very formal, polite and deferential, if a little cool and robotic. One night after an exhausting day, we decided to ""grab a quick late bite"" at the main restaurant, Cascade. This turned into a torture fest of waiting until our mediocre and astronomically priced food arrived. Location is good, not great. It is very close to Roppongi-ichitome station and a pleasant walk to bustling Roppongi crossing and Roppongu Hills complex. Take a minute to stroll the hidden little terraced Ark Gardens on the hillside behind the hotel. The quiet, embassy neighborhood between the hotel and the Tokyo Tower also contained small cafes and bakeries worth exploring. We had a few drinks at the new Mixx bar on the 36th floor, which is trying like hell to be hip and cool by having a cadre of bumbling, Euro-trendy bartenders doing a clown-car impression at making pseudo-molecular $28 martinis. Fun for a quick visit, but if you are used to no smoking in bars (we are), the heavily smoking Asian and Euro customers will drive you out pretty quick. Awesome view, though!

Club level comes with breakfast, cocktails and snacks and free drinks and also gives you free access to gym, pool and high speed internet. Definitely worth the extra 5,000 yen a night.The location of the ANA is good and it is a well known hotel. The Friendly Airport Limousine (Big orange bus) drops you at the hotel from Narita. This is the easiest way to get to the hotel. Each way is 3,000 yen or if you buy roundtrip at airport for 6,000 yen they give you a 2 day subway pass with it which costs 1,400 yen. Taxis are extremely expensive. Over $300 from airport to hotel. Taxis in general are expensive the flag pull is 710 yen ($9). Luckily the hotel is right next to a subway station with access to the Ginza, Namoboku and Chiyoda lines. These lines can get you all over the city. Since the hotel is in Roppongi, all the night life is a 20 minute walk or 5 minute cab ride away. Not far from Tokyo Midtown or Roppongi Hills.The hotel is a large hotel with a dozen restaurants and bars....all insanely expensive. I would go out to eat. Soo many good options in Tokyo.Hotel is decently priced compared to Mandarin Oriental, Four Seasons Marounochi, Park Hyatt, Peninsula etc. Next time I plan to try Mandarin or Four Seasons.Service at the hotel is very good.

I've stayed at the New Otani (old and run down if you're in the tower), the Imperial (old and run down - period), and the Hyatt in Shinjuku (nice but to far from my office). There are other hotels nearby that are nicer but for the money the ANA is quite nice and sufficient.Location gets a ""B"": The ANA is the first stop on the Limousine Bus which is great after a long flight however it's still about a 20 min taxi ride from Tokyo Station. Also it's a 15 minute walk to Rippongi which isn't bad but it's also a bit of a walk to the subway system. Overall the location isn't poor by any means but just keep in mind that you'll need to walk a little.Rooms are a ""B"": Small by American standards, large by European and Japanese standards. Well maintained and clean. Nothing extraordinary but adequate. Rooms all have high speed wireless internet and flat screen TV's. Television is mostly Japanese although you'll get CNN and occasionally Fox depending on time of day. Also CNBC is available in English when the American markets are open but other than that no other English TV.Service get's a ""A"": This is Japan. Expect to get great service by western standards. The staff at the ANA are excellent, professional, and always available. Frankly if you've not been to Japan you'll be shocked at the focus the Japanese people place on service. Why can't all countries be like this!!!Gym Facilities get a B+/A-: The gym is well kept, clean, and the equipment is in good working order. Gyms in Japan frequently are built for Japanese clientele and this means really ""spa's"" so a Western Style gym is a treat. The facilities are small but house 4 treadmills, 3 elipticals, 3 stationary bikes, a multi-function weight systems and two racks of dumbbells. Also a small area for stretching is available. They also have an outdoor pool but I've not used or seen it.Restaurants get a B: The lobby restaurant usually is buffet style for all meals and the food selection is quite good. The problem is the food here is quite pricey. Frankly I find myself visiting the market to keep my costs down. Breakfast will run you 3000 yen ($35). Lunch and Dinner are more. The hotel also has a few other restaurants - a steak house, a french restaurant, and an Italian restaurant. All VERY pricey. Sky Avenue on the top of the hotel is a great place for evening drinks and to look over the city. Again, drink prices are pretty steep but the view and the decor make it worth the visit at least once while you're in the hotel. The lounge in the hotel lobby is very comfortable and again nice decor, friendly staff, spaciousness, and overall ambience make it a good place for early evening drinks or a place to catch up after a long day.Overall this is a solid B hotel and relative to prices in Japan a reasonable value.",San Jose,"Garys_Comments</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose</strong>",119,4.0

The size of the suite was perfect for us as we had our two children with us. It was immaculately clean and kept so during our entire 8-day stay by an army of Japanese grandmothers who were very friendly despite the language barrier. As Ambassador members, we were entitled to free cocktails at the club lounge on the 35th floor which had a beautiful view of Tokyo and the food and cocktails were delicious. On the 37th floor was a teppanyaki grill where we had Kobe steaks that simply melted in our mouths.

Internet is decently fast in the room. Room service food quality is average and poor value. I ordered a tonkatsu don and it didn't taste nearly as good as the average Japanese takeaway lunchbox. Staff is very attentive and polite. I did not try the restaurants at the hotel so cannot comment on that. Shuttle bus from Narita door-to-door is very convenient if you are like me who don't like dragging luggage around the subway on your own. The closest subway station has elevator going up to the subway exit so that's a plus even if you decide to take the subway/rail to/from airport.If you want to use this as a place for shopping around Tokyo, think again. By the end of the day when you are carrying handful of bags, it's tough walking 15min underground in the subway tunnels before getting back to hotel. There are a few convenience shops and one or two cafes within 10 min walk from the hotel. There is otherwise not much around the hotel other than commercial buildings. Not much choice of food within the hotel area. Felt reasonably safe at night on my own within 5 minute radius of hotel and to/from subway station.

The staff were courteous and helpful when approached, but it felt as though one had to ask for assistance before we got it. For example, on arrival at the hotel we received no assistance whatsoever with our suitcases and we had to bring our own suitcases up to the main lobby on the 2nd floor and then (after checking in) up to our room. Luckily for us, we packed light and were in good spirits, so we didn't make a big deal of it. At the buffet breakfast, the staff did not clear our empty plates and dishes or refill our coffee/tea unless we asked them to do so. We had to resort to stacking the plates and placing them on the table next to ours. When we called the hotel's ""Instant Service"" line to make a dinner reservation at one of the hotel eateries one night , the staff always had to confirm times, info etc. before calling us back. Those were just three examples, but there were others. I had researched hotel reviews on this site before booking, and decided to go with this one when I found out that my first choice hotel (the Grand Hyatt) was full. I decided not to pay for the Club room, because I had read that the lounge benefits were not nearly as good as at other Intercontinental hotels and that the lounge had long queues at breakfast and peak times. All in all, I'm happy that I made that choice.The buffet breakfast was fine, but it would have been nice if they had varied the menu just a little bit more.The hotel had a ""business"" atmosphere and feel to it, so if you're looking to completely unwind this may not be the place for you. Try the Mandarin Oriental instead. We booked a deluxe room with a king sized bed overlooking the city, which was very clean and comfortable. The bathroom, while clean and new, was small. People with larger frames may find it claustrophobic. Only one person could stand comfortably at the bathroom sink at any one time. We ate only one meal at the hotel coffee shop towards the end of a (tiring) trip. The food was average and the menu was extremely limited- was expecting better food based on my experience at other Intercontinental hotels in Asia. We had wanted to try the teppanyaki at the Japanese restaurant, but couldn't get a good time slot as we left it to the last minute. Getting to the hotel from the airport is hassle-free and reasonable if you take the Airport Limousine bus. One single ticket for adults costs 3000Yen and the bus will take you directly to the G/F of the hotel.On the plus front, the hotel was well situated in the heart of Tokyo, which made it perfect for exploring the city. Roppongi is within walking distance, albeit up a gentle slope. Taking a taxi to the major crossing at Roppongi would set you back about 710 Yen (flag-fall price on the taxi meter). Tokyo Tower is about 900 Yen away by taxi. The nearest metro station is Tameike-sanno (Exit 13), which is served by the Ginza line. However, the location of the hotel means that there is an overlap between two metro stations (i.e. Tameike-sanno and Kokkai-gijidomae). This is a definite plus because it means that you will have immediate access to 4 different metro lines- the Ginza, Namboku, Chiyoda and Marunouchi lines. The walk from the hotel to Exit 13 of Tameike-sanno is 1 minute, but the walk to the actual platforms is longer and in certain cases can seem like a trek in itself. That said, once inside the metro compound, you will feel safe and be protected from the elements. If you plan on doing a lot of sightseeing and wish to hop on and off the metro, consider buying an unlimited one-day pass which costs 710 Yen for adults (or 1000 Yen if you also want to use the Toei metro lines).",HK,"Trustfundbaby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>HK</strong>",9,4.0

The steakhouse charging £140 for Kobe and £80 for a normal steak seems extravagant. We opted for 10 mins walks into Akasaka, which offered plenty of choice, from excellent Korean, Thai, Indian and of-course outstanding, Sashimi and Sushi. The Laughry steakhouse across the road is better value at around £50 a steak.The gym was minimal and always full in the AM hours. I was not charged ... but some guests were!!

All of this is served in the lounge where the views are fantastic, especially at night.The room on one of the higher floors (below the lounge), whilst on the small side (though not unusual for Tokyo) was just right with a small sitting area, massive bed, excellent and large shower and bath (combined).

My original choice was ""The strings"", another Intercontinental hotel in Tokyo, but after comparing the reviews (and the price), we decided on this one.The Good:- Great location, 10 min walk from the (in)famous Roppongi bar/club district. On the main Roppongi street, from the crossings toward the Tokyo tower is filled with trashy bars and clubs. However, you will also find some small but nice eateries in the back alley. In the opposite direction, there’s Roppongi Midtown, the luxurious shopping mall with great restaurants and surprisingly spacious park in the back. Toward Azabu st, there’s Roppongi Hills, another shopping mall, but less luxurious than the Midtown.We got off at Kokkai-gijido mae st, but it was a long walk to the Exit #13. Roppongi Icchome might have been closer.-Heavenly bed. The mattress, the Duvet, the softness of the fabric, they were all excellent! There were 2 separate TV Channel guide, which was a bit confusing, but not a big thing. The room was clean, with a big window, which had a great view of Tokyo.-Club Intercontinental Floor. This comes with variety of exclusive services: evening cocktail and canapés, all day refreshments, complimentary use of Fitness Center etc. Note: If you’d like to use the shoe shine, which is part of the above exclusive service, you need to call the front and make a reservation. I thought it was somewhere I could go to get it done on the spot, but they will actually come to your room to pick the shoes up, and bring them back to you.-The bath. Nice size, clean, a shower with good water pressure. Though all the channels were local Japanese program, you can watch TV while you’re in the bathroom. The towels and the robes were nice and absorbent.The Bad-The food. The canapés served in the evening weren’t great, just mediocre. Neither was the dessert. The morning buffet was pitiful, worst 5 star hotel buffet so far. The selection was very limited, bread was really dry, the coffee from the machine was horrible (though they seemed to be using the great illy coffee bean)We’ve also tried the Manhattan Lounge Lunch buffet after check out, but the food was not good either. Its décor was a bit bizarre, almost like 60’s club. They should have refurbished this place as well. Other restaurants may have been good, but rather pricey. Considering the location, you can easily find better restaurants outside of the hotel.-The breakfast buffet. The club room was already close to the full capacity when we tried the evening canapé,even though we arrived there about 3 min after the cocktail time. I suppose it’s because they have too many people for the club floor. So I asked one of the staffs how it would be like for the breakfast buffet. She told us that the it’d be so crowded that people would line up till the elevator, unless we arrive “early” and that she was sorry for the inconvenience . Early, she meant 7-7:30 am. I really didn’t want to get up at 7am on the Sunday morning, but I’m a big hotel buffet fan and had to give it a go. So I woke up 7am and hit the buffet. 8am came, but there were still plenty of seats available. I suppose for the business use, starting the breakfast at 7am is right. But to accommodate all the other client, it would be great if they either extend the breakfast time or appoint bigger space. There are few points that can be improved, but my overall stay was satisfactory.","Rome, Italy","LaSirenaRM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rome, Italy</strong>",16,5.0

This area is famed for its nightlife but it's also famed for as a place where foreign riff-raff and trashy locales meet, often with unsavoury results. The area has gone upmarket in recent years with the new Roppongi Hills and Tokyo Midtown shopping developments, but the main strip is still somewhat trashy. The ANA Intercontinental is a 10 minute walk from Roppongi and it's easier accessed from the Tameike-Sanno Station of the Tokyo Metro (rather than the Roppongi station). The hotel is in ARK HILLS which offers a few dining options, so it's best to go to Roppongi for more options. The American Embassy and the Japanese Prime Minister's residence are all within walking distance of the hotel.THE ROOMAll the rooms in the hotel were refurbished in 2009, a year after the hotel became an Intercontinental. We reserved a Junior Suite which allowed us entry to the Club Intercontinental Lounge. The check-in was fairly efficient, if a bit mechanical and done in the main lobby (although you can check-in in the Club Lounge). We were escorted to our room by the staff, and showed the facilities in the room. The room was big (about 52 squared meters) with two big windows which allowed in plenty of light. The room had a separate sitting/work area with its own 37 inch widescreen LCD TV with an interactive service and iPod connector, a DVD Player, tea making facilities, and two complimentary bottles of water. This lounge/work area also had a big work table, a speaker phone, an in-room safe as well as high-speed LAN Internet service (complimentary for Club Intercontinental) and but no WIFI. The minibar was fully stocked with snacks, alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. The semi-separate sleeping area had a comfortable king size bed, a wardrobe (actually in the bathroom), as well an iHome alarm clock which has a slot for guests to connect their iPods. The bedroom also had a separate 37 inch LCD. The bed was quite comfortable and was given a turn down service in the evening. The furniture and the design of the room had a tasteful modern Japanese look and were well taken care of! The only qualm I had with the room was that there was no real closet space, except the small closet in the bathroom. The view from our room was OK: We had a view of the Tokyo skyline although a huge residential tower blocks most of the good views.THE BATHROOMThe marble bathroom was unique as it was almost part of the room (a sliding door can close the bathroom/toilet area with the bedroom). There were two sinks, a separate bathroom/shower room with a separate bath (with a small LCD TV) and a shower - All in the same glass enclosed area. The shower was great as it came with numerous jets on the length of the pipe as well as being a rain shower - One can get a goat soak! The toilet was in a separate enclosed room and contained a new Japanese washlet (bidet). There were all the usual extra amenities such as toothbrushes and razors as well as REN branded amenities in the bath. There were plenty of towels for use. As mentioned, the bathroom is unique but can be nerve-racking for shy people as it's not really private unless the entire area is closed off with the opaque sliding door.THE EXECUTIVE LOUNGEAs we were staying in the Junior Suite, we had access to the Executive Lounge. The lounge is quite big with its own separate shower facilities for guests who wish to freshen up after checking-out of their room. The food area provides free soft drinks and cookies all day. The breakfast spread in the morning is big with a good variety of both hot and cold options. In the evening, an evening cocktail ritual provides champagne, wines, beer and a variety of canapes, cheese and biscuits, sushi, fruit, olives, pate, salami and the like. The quality of the food was very good and the alcoholic selection was more than satisfactory. The Lounge also had a meeting room, and dedicated concierges as well as complimentary WIFI. Overall, the Executive Lounge is worth the upgrade if you can afford it.THE HOTEL FACILITIESThe hotel offered a variety of facilities for the guests, some of which require an extra tariff. There was an outdoor pool (open in the summer months), (small) fitness facilities, as well as a separate spa/esthetic salon (The pool and the fitness facilities require an extra tariff but this is waived for those on Club Intercontinental floors). We didn't use the facilities. The common areas of the hotel were recently refurbished, and look modern but not really luxurious. The hotel also has a shopping arcade but the prices and quality of the goods are suspect - There are more options near Roppongi. The hotel gets a lot of foot traffic from visitors to the bars and restaurants so the common areas can be noisy.THE RESTAURANTS/BARSThe hotel had 7 restaurants (serving Japanese, Chinese, Italian and buffet selections), 4 lounges/bars and a delicatessen to choose from. We ate at the Cascade (main) restaurant which serves an international buffet and found the food and price reasonable. The hotel will soon open a three Michelin starred chef restaurant – Pierre Gagnaire on the 36th floor. There are countless other food options right outside the hotel in the Roppongi district.THE SERVICEOverall, the service of the hotel was good as everyone was courteous, smiling and professional (with the exception of the surly check-in staff). Communicating in English was not a major problem although the staff's word choice can be a bit abrupt. I don't think that it's intentional, but further training in polite English use can be ideal. It's worth noting that the hotel is actually a co-branded ANA (All Nippon Airlines) and Intercontinental hotel which is unique in Japan. This is not a major problem unless patrons try to convert their ANA Intercontinental PRIORITY CLUB points to Japan Airline miles (ANA's rival in Japan), which is impossible. The point accumulation is also a bit different from other Intercontinental hotels so it's best to check with the hotel for details.THE CONCLUSIONThe ANA Intercontinental Hotel bills itself as a luxury establishment but in fact is a good five star hotel. It is a bit off-located but it has good facilities and service. It mostly cateres to business people due to its location, but it can be a good base for those who are visiting Tokyo as the city's main sights are easily accessible with the Metro (subway). The price of rooms in this hotel are lower than the other newer luxury properties in Tokyo. Overall, a great experience!","Tokyo, Japan","MRIII</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",135,4.0

I got the chance to stay at the Intercontinental Hong Kong and the Intercontinental Singapore before this hotel. I will be honest - I got a great upgrade thanks to my Ambassador status but I did not think the hotel had any atmosphere and lacked a certain something......My room was great - as you would expect in a Suite but outside of that things were a little impersonal. The restaurants were not very welcoming, the prices were outrageous - and I have stayed in some expensive hotels!!!!I had access to the Club Intercontinental Lounge which had spectacular views and free champagne for 2 hours but no atmosphere and the evening nibbles were laughable. Having just come from the Intercontinental Singapore which did not have champagne on tap but had some great evening snacks - I preferred Singapore by a long way. The views are great from the lounge though I will admit. The staff only wanted to serve a few select business men - return travelers I have no doubt.It is not often I feel uncomfortable in a hotel - I have stayed in many many hotels in my time - including lots of Intercontinentals, which is my hotel of choice. Walking around the lobby, avoiding all the Japanese business lunch folks, I had a distinct feeling of not being welcome. No smiles, no hellos no staff to ask directions, when I wandered around looking a little lost no one to jump out and help as in other hotels.I loved the room - the bathroom was superb - but my overall feeling was almost of an airport hotel - I had a cosier feeling in the Crowne Plaza at Narita than I did in this top class hotel. I couldn't tell you one particular incident that makes me think this - just a feeling as I wondered around. Funnily enough - I had just stayed in Hong Kong and Singapore and this was the most expensive stay - and the least enjoyable.I would not stay here again - although it is a fabulous looking hotel, it appears to have lost the ability to look after its guests - they are just an after thought to the conference meetings, business lunches and the like.","London, United Kingdom","aks120LasVegas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",130,3.0

We had a room on the 23rd floor with a great view of the city.

The concierge team in particular were superb: they were very knowledgeable and one even translated a brief written message into Japanese for us.The top floor bar had a great view but was staggeringly expensive, even for Tokyo. As often occurs in Japan there was a high cover charge even if you are just having drinks. All of the restaurants seemed overpriced compared to similar places to eat in the neighbourhood.Transport links are good - the Friendly Airport Limousine company has a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel every 30 minutes, there is a very busy taxi rank at the hotel, and there are two subway stations within 5 minutes walk (although to get onto one of the lines you have to walk 600 metres underground once you've got into the station!). There are plenty of restaurants and convenience stores in a short walk - on our last night we wondered into Akasaka (over the main road) and found several streets full of places to eat and drink. I definitely recommend Ramen Jyangara for hearty cheap fast food, and Ninja for an entertaining meal.The only disappointment was that the pool was already closed for the season, despite it being about 28º C and sunny during our stay.If staying here over a weekend, I would definitely recommend joining the Intercontinental Ambassador programme - they give you a free weekend night voucher which is worth more than the cost of the membership, and you get other perks as well (room upgrade, free newspaper etc.).",London,"mxlondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",109,4.0

A big, ample building with lots of amenities, but the most basic of them, the ones you can expect for the price you´re paying, are available at additional price, not advertised when you book. This is what I call ""hidden costs"".Let me explain. I paid around 150 euros per night from Sept. 11 to Sept 15 booking well in advance, for a double room taking advantage of a special discount rate from Intercontinental via Internet, that cannot be cancelled or modified after you purchase it. The price was right, having into account that Tokyo is a expensive city and the hotel is well located (Akasaka Area). But, as soon as I arrived, I was ofered an ""upgrade"" to my room to have access to the pool, free internet (incredible, since at the Rose Garden Hotel, a modest but very good hotel in Shinjuku, it was free), free drinks and other things that didn´t interest us for around 60 euros per night more. I refused, and immediately I was offered another ""option"" that for 3000 yen per night more granted free internet access and, I want to believe, a better room. The recepcionist spoke very bad english, a let down in a hotel like this.To add insult to injury, the nearest subway station is very near the main hotel entrance, but then you have to walk around 7 minutes to actually reach the trains, a very big disadvantage specially at night when you return with bags and tired of a long sightseeing day. You cannot use your Japan Rail pass, since the Yamanote line, the one that circles the center of Tokyo is a bit far away, and you have to pay ""twice"" to use the subway instead of the pass.My recomendation is that you look for a good price-quality hotel like the Rose Garden in Shinjuku, with free internet access, very well located, within walking distance of a bunch of shopping malls, atraction, subway station (Nishi-Shinjuku), kind english-speaking staff, lots of places to eat for cheap around and nice (a bit small but confy) rooms.",Spain,"Matrod</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Spain</strong>",7,1.0

A standard room was then around 19.000 yen, so the extra 8.000 yen for Club Floor was really worth it !Club Lounge is on 35th floor and our room was on 29th. I think that our room is exactly the same as the Executive Room (without Club privileges). Now, I travelled a lot for business and have seen great and terrible Club Lounges, but this was indeed the finest ever. Fully renovated with expensive Scandinavian and other-good-taste design, very large and - also quite rare - true Champagne as much as you want during 'cocktail hour' (each day from 5.30 to 7.30 PM). During cocktail hour, you could also have many other types of alcohol and fingerfood. At other times, no alcohol was available. Room itself was standard size (around 26 sq m) and we had a nice view of Tokyo Tower. Frankly, I don't understand why others are so keen on having a room with a view on Tokyo Tower... the other side of the hotel tower looked out towards Shibuya and Shinjuku (we saw it from the Lounge) and this was equally impressive in our opinion. Our room was recently renovated, so nice decor and good, functional bathroom. I have to say, though, that lobby was often crowded and looked dated. I suppose therefore that standard rooms are not renovated neither. Our experience would have been less positive on these floors, so.... go for Club in this hotel ! Location wise : not too practical for getting around a lot, but good for local area (Roppongi). Oh yeah, last tip : there is a shower room just next to Club lounge, which was handy for us since our flight was late in the evening. You will need to ask the reception on Club Floor to unlock it when you want to use it.

The rooms are very well designed and although not huge by US standards they feel quite large and have everything you need. And of course Japanese toilets......(for those of you yet to experience these they're normal toilets with heated seats and a number of fancy bidet options accessed by very clearly labeled buttons). Rates were on the expensive side but that seems typical for Tokyo. I wasn't looking forward to getting down into town from Narita but this hotel is on the bus route and it was easy and efficient. All hotels in town are about 60-90 minutes from Narita and this one took about 70 minutes. Taxis are ridiculously expensive so rail or bus are your choices. Check-in was fast and we had upgraded to the executive club. Got a high floor room and rooms were very quiet....no noise issues. Spent two nights here and the first night the club level wasn't crowded but was much busier on the second night. Still, no problems with getting food and the wine selections were excellent. You can walk around from this hotel to a couple of local shrines if you feel the need to stretch your legs.....10/15 minutes walk and nice to see them in the midst of concrete modern Tokyo. The Imperial Palace is also nearby and walking distance but a little further. We didn't make it there this visit but will do so next time. Subway is close and convenient. The ANA is a high quality hotel with comfortable rooms , excellent service and easy transfers to/from Narita.....we would stay here again",Colorado,"David R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colorado</strong>",19,5.0

They were correct.I agree with some reviewers that the lobby looks a little dated. I booked a Club Intercontinental Room which gives you access to the new Club Lounge on level 25. Check in is also handled in the lounge. The Club is very modern and chic, decorated in warms browns and greys with some great views.Check in was a little slow due to some confusing elements in my booking. The porter was very patient and waited with our bags. He was very pleased to show us the facilities in the room.The room itself was of a reasonable size and had recently been renovated so had a great modern feel to it. The bathroom had a shower in the bath and had an odd design whereby some of the water drained over the edge to an overflow. First reaction was to assume flooding but it is designed to channel the water to the drain - quite neat really. The room had all the trimmings you would expect of an interantional five star hotel. The addition of complimentary internet in the room for Club guests is a great touch as is use of the fitness centre.For the first two days the Lounge was pleasant with a good ebb and flow of guests making it comfortably relaxing. On the last two days there was a national holiday and the hotel was fully booked which meant the lounge was full to the brim. This then involved queuing for breakfast and cocktails in the evening - not what you expect. The poor staff where overwhelmed by the crowds and were struggling to cope.I must admit to being dissatisfied with this and made this known to the team. At the time a suitable solution was not offered but on my return in the afternoon the Director of Guest Experience sought me out to apologise. This was very much appreciated and he did well on his service recovery. I do understand that I was not the only guest to have an issue with this!!The lounge breakfast and canape offerings are identical each day. This is clearly not a disaster but some variety may be appreciated if you are there for a few nights. The wine and spirits range in the evening is excellent.We also used the lounge concierge to find us a local high end restaurant and she found us an excellent option in Ginza. We also made use of the concierge on the ground floor to assit with Shinkansen train reservations, she was also excellent.Overall it was a great option for a hotel in Tokyo. Very close to the entry of the subway (although be prepared to do some walking!). I also recommend using the Limousine Bus Service to and from Narita for JPY3,000 each way. It drops you off and picks you up at the door so there is no need to negotiate the subway system with bags.","Sydney, Australia","wockinwod</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",179,4.0

The rooms on this floor have been renovated and are a vast improvement over the lower floor rooms which are very dated. The rooms are a reasonable size for Japan and the bathroom in the second room was nice - wet room type shower, bath tub etc. The gym is small and is to be honest for a 5 star hotel hopeless - a few sad looking dumbells and a multigym plus some joggers etc. I've stayed at the Conrad before and that's got a much better gym plus a swimming pool to write home about. Like many hotels in Japan you have to pay for everything - gym, swimming pool, even the pool chairs. That said if you're here on a corp rate they comp the gym etc.So net-net, not bad depends on which floor.

The lobby was very 1980s We had executive rooms on the 34th floor which were pleasantly modern but small. Wireless broadband (cost included) and a choice of English language channels were available. Tried the gym which was very small, especially for such a large hotel. Gym use is complimentary for those in executive room but was, I think, Y1,500 for others. As there were no staff in the gym the charge relied on an honesty book system. Didn't try the pool as it was on a different floor and as its outdoor I gathered it was only open in the summer months. Strangely there was no lift direct from the executive floors to the gym, you have to change lifts half way down the building.Between 5.30pm and 7.30pm drinks and canapes are served in the executive lounge which we enjoyed but was very busy. The lounge could do with more tables and chairs.We went out to Roppongi for dinner but had breakfast in the executive lounge before checking out. The selection wasn't great and there was a queue to get a table even at 10am when breakfast finished at 11am. Again the lounge needs to be expanded.The area around the hotel is quiet. A 15 minute (uphill) walk gets to to lively Roppongi and we would rather have stayed there.

The bed was large and very comfortable. The bathroom was a bit small, but very clean and updated. It even had a small LCD television with a limited number of channels.

There are countless other restaurants specializing in all types of food. I was impressed with all of the choices.Location - The hotel is located in the central part of Tokyo. Access to the subway system is not bad. There are 2 stations within a few minutes of walking from the hotel. There is plenty of nightlife in nearby Roppongi.

I've stayed here before several times over the last 20 years, and it's a classic good quality hotel, in a good location (between the entertainment of Roppongi and the offices of Akasaka and Kasumigaseki). It's big and sort of international-bland decor, but perfectly pleasant. The rooms aren't big by international standards, but adequate, and well finished, with fast internet, kettle, well appointed bathroom, and a usable work desk. Your business acquaintances will acknowledge it as a good quality hotel, as evidenced by the amount of weddings they cater for at weekends. Service was generally good as you'd expect, an we made full use of the concierge and bell captain's services. An extra plus is that it's a direct stop for the frequent ""airport limousine"" buses to/from the airports.The only disappointment was that although the hotel has a decent sized lap pool, it's open only 10-5, meaning that it's no use for business travellers wanting a workout.Tokyo's currently over-supplied with top-end hotels, so shop around carefully as rates zoom up and down rapidly.

Was good that this was a household name. Reception staff were efficient and gave us a room on the 19th floor, which had an amazing view of Roppongi Hills. The room itself is pretty small, but I guess this was to be expected from Tokyo. Nevertheless, the furniture and decoration were very tasteful, like a typical Intercontinental room.

The closest area to walk to is Roppongi, about a 15 minute walk and worth checking out for the modern art museum, some nice restaurants (Gonpachi - a must! Lots of fun and reasonably priced, great food and Joel Robuchon, the very expensive french/asian fusion chef) and the view from Roppongi Tower.Finally, the staff is very friendly.

The lobby area is inviting with its open ceilings, but once you get into your room, claustraphobia sets in. The location is central, but could be a bit deceiving if you're expecting to walk right off the train platform to your hotel.ROOM (booked the cheapest rate available): Nothing to write home about. Size of the room is ok for central Tokyo, not small but not exactly big either; good size for 2, but will feel crowded with 3 adults. The LCD TV was on the smaller side (probably 19""), expected more for this class of hotel. The views are hit or miss, as the lower floor views will be blocked by the surrounding buildings or expressway... so book/request a high floor if you can. Bathroom, fixtures and furniture are at least 10 years old and could use some updating.DINING: only ate at the breakfast buffet (included in rate we found), very good selection of Japanese and Western food. Expensive if you pay separate (3000+ yen), but probably worth it if you're extremely hungry. Other dining options seemed ridiculously expensive, probably catering to tourists who are unwilling to venture outside the area.LOCATION: The subway entrance/exit (Tameike-Sanno Station) is right next to the hotel, but the actual subway platform is a good hike (5+ min at a brisk Tokyo pace)... might be a bit taxing if you plan on dragging around a lot of baggage. The good news is you have direct access to the Ginza Subway line, great for tourists wanting to see Shibuya, Harajuku (Omotesando), Ginza, Odaiba (via Shimbashi) or Asakusa. Also on the up side, limousine buses bound for both airports (Haneda and Narita) stop at the hotel, making for an easy trip to/from. If you plan on taking a Hato Bus tour, they pick-up/drop-off at this hotel as well.","Tokyo, Japan","foofighter1981</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",63,3.0

We were initially given a 16th floor room with a terrible view of nothing but air conditioning units on roof tops, but complained as this was a special night for us, and we were moved to a 23rd floor room with an excellent view of the Tokyo Tower. The room was great, with a much better bathroom, bigger bed etc. They are building a new tower block alongside the side if the building we were staying on, and this may obscure things for those staying on lower floors. They were working at almost exactly our level on the new building - don't know how high they are going! The lobby restaurants and shops were all very nice and open until 10pm. The food/drink is as expensive as you would expect for a place like this. So this is a nice hotel overall.The only negative side is where this hotel is. It is close to a couple of metro stations, which sounds great but if your aren't Tokyo savvy then you may struggle with getting to them. This isn't close to any of the airport lines etc. Although the Limousine Buses may call there (check their website). The closest area with any shops and restaurants at non-hotel prices is Roppongi, this is a good 10-15mins walk, and not the nicest of areas of an evening - a little bit seedy and full of tourists. I'd really only recommend this hotel for a night or two, and if you can afford to either use it as a base to go elsewhere, or if you can afford the hotel restaurants.","Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","William B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milton Keynes, United Kingdom</strong>",44,3.0

Mind you saying that whilst I was there the hotel held a very traditional Japanese wedding on the saturday and from what I could gather no expense was spared ! So perhaps the hotel is held in high regard by the locals ? ANA is a very clean and modern hotel. I stayed in a basic room on the 24th floor as I was only staying in Tokyo for 4 nights. Last time I stayed in Tokyo I was in the Palace Hotel and I felt that the hotel was in need of an 'upgrade' ...for want of an expression. ANA is perfect for the business traveller....and suits if travelling with your partner. Everything you need is in your room...if not ask and it will be . .. In fact if you need anything at all, the staff are all very eager to help and do more than is required of them. They really did try to make my stay as comfortable as possible and ALL staff were curtious, always willing to please and bent over backwards to help should you need any. For the more 'adventurous traveller' the hotel is located near the Roppongi ..literally a 10 minute stroll. ... Tokyo isnt necessarily the cheapest town in the world and the hotel certainly reflects that. I personally found the eating and drinking ''in house'' was particularly expensive. I had one incident which was most unexpected....got up one morning and there was NO water supply at all to the hotel...it was only off for 30 mins...but if one had appointments it was no consolation. When I returned later that day 2 bottles of red wine awaited me with a letter prefuse apology....which was very nice. I will stay again when I return to Tokyo . I would also recommend other business travellers and tourists ( if it's within your budgets) to stay there too.","Chiclana de la Frontera, Spain","TheGeez</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chiclana de la Frontera, Spain</strong>",518,5.0

It is better known as the ANA. It has a subway station (tameike-sanno) on the Ginza line (colour coded yellow on transport maps and signs) almost outside but this not particularly helpful for reaching either Tokyo or Shinjuku stations which are the two stopping off points for the Narita Express train from Airport. This is because the Ginza line connects directly with neither and you need to make one change in order to get to the terminal points. There can be a lot of stairs too in Tokyo metro, so a problem if you are carrying luggage. We found a taxi back to Tokyo Station cost YEN 1520 (only twice what the 4 metro/local train tickets would have been. A good option, for two or more travelling together.The hotel is a skyscraper of 37 floors with a bar on 36th floor and outstanding views. Worth YEN 900 for a glass of white wine (though watch the extra cover charge after 19.00). The reception in the hotel is not at street level but on the next floor up. Wide open area.We stayed 3 nights from Sunday 5 to Wednesday 8 October 2008.Because of our Ambassador Priority Club card we got quick check in at the discrete desk at left side of main reception and a room on the 21st floor served by the express lift. The fixed advance purchase tariff did not qualify to use the Business Lounge on 34th floor but a chance encounter and discussion with the General Manager resulted in him offering access. Worth having for the free drinks and breakfast there.Room 2133 was a fair size and equipped with comfortable beds. A bowl of fruit awaited us. The wardrobe door was broken but quickly repaired while we went out for dinner. But the room was nowhere near as good as we had got in the Group's Crowne Plaza hotel in Hiroshima. As in 3 of the 4 hotels we used in Japan, there was iron and ironing board. The TV irritatingly had Japanese dubbing of English channels like BBC and CNN. The bathroom had the now familiar electric toilet but without the automatic flush after each use which had caused so much noise after nocturnal calls of nature.. The shower was in the bath. There were supplies as in every one of the 4 hotels of toothpaste/brush, disposable razors, washcloth etc. The soap was liquid in a container so bring a bar if you prefer that.We had breakfast in the spacious 2nd floor entrance area. Lots of business people - almost entirely male, having business discussions. Reasonable fare though as in every Japanese hotel, short on fish and fresh fruit. A bit more bread and cheese but not much. To see what the Intercontinental is capable of offering for breakfast, try its hotel in Warsaw! Here it cost YEN 3500 each. One morning we went across the linking walkway to Ark Mori building and had two excellent breakfasts in Andersens for YEN 2650. We would have done that on day 3 if we had not been given access to Club Lounge. If you are on holiday, want breakfast without a networking meeting, give it a try.The business centre at the side of reception had several PCs. These were good but Internet access was YEN 525 for 15 minutes. About 500 metres down the road past the subway station is a branch of FedEx Kinkos with access at half that price.The hotel pool, which we did not see, as it had closed for the winter two weeks earlier, is outside on the 4t h floor. It was very disappointing. I for one am prepared to swim in unheated pools. Outside temperatures were 20 C + during our stay.The concierge was exceptionally knowledgeable and helpful, and spoke good English. We found this was rare in Japan and you do need to be sure that ""Yes"" in answer to your question is more than ""yes, I have heard your question but not understood it"" as there can be misunderstandings.We did not eat dinner in the hotel as prices are steep. Go next door to Ark Mori building, unless someone else is paying and unless your Japanese client will be impressed by the luxury surroundings. Holidaymakers like us found better value outside.Most guests were westerners and apparently on a business trip or at a conference. You don't get a feel of being in Japan.If you need an ATM accepting Western plastic cards (most do NOT), go to post office ATM on third floor Ark Mori building. It is inside so wait until PO opens at 09.00.We paid an average of YEN 25000 (EUR 175) per night inc tax and service but excluding breakfast. I would stay again if in the area.","Croydon, United Kingdom","alanreynolds</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Croydon, United Kingdom</strong>",1124,5.0

It definitely had one of the best services we have ever experienced. The ""Concierges"" are always available and helpful; although you may have some difficulties to communicate in English, they always solve your problem or answer your question. The lobby is very fancy and ""cool"" with its waterfalls, lights, plants and bars. The rooms are clean and pleasant, with views over the city, improving according to how high floor you stay at. But they remain very ""business"" and quite standard. If the hotel gives a feeling of luxury, it might not be as exquisite and special as you would expect it to be. Of course the panoramic views over the city from the Manhattan Lounge (36th floor) are definitely worth it, (and they have good Japanese steak meat). On the other hand, the inroom food you might order at night (you feel pretty jetlagged :)) is nothing special for the price. You unfortunatly have to pay extra to access facilities such as the pool and the gym, (1000Y to 1500Y per person and per session), which really feels like useless expenses, especially since the pool is pretty average (more of a public pool than a 5* hotel's). The location is ok (10 minutes walk from Roppongi and near a couple of subway stations), but if I should return to Tokyo I'd probably pick something like Shinjuku, Ginza or Shibuya, which are much more lively. The service is really the one thing that made us enjoy our stay at this hotel.","Paris, France","ade9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",8,4.0

Now that may seem quite expensive, but that is less than the average price for a hotel in the same class, eg. the Hilton was ¥28000, Ritz was over ¥50000, Four Seasons ¥40000, Mercure ¥24000 etc. We stayed for a grand total of four nights.We arrived from Osaka in the afternoon and took a taxi from Tokyo Station to the hotel. The ride cost just ¥1600, which is great value for Tokyo. It was a pretty short distance as well. Taxis are quite cheap in Japan, because you don't pay for sitting in traffic. The hotel staff immediately took us to check-in and we went through a very thorough check-in procedure. The hotel wanted to know every guest in every room. A bit much, but it was just so they could make room keys if we lost our one. We were given interconnecting rooms. We asked if there was a view and she said that the interconnecting rooms were very limited. We are Priority Club Platinum Elite, and the only real benefit was a complimentary drink for ONE person. We were also given a quite high level. We had booked to be between the bottom floor to the 20th, and we got the 17th floor. We were whisked up to our room by the bell desk people. The rooms were very big for Tokyo, and had been recently renovated. We did have a nice view looking out over the Roppongi Area. The bathroom was particularly nice, and they had a box of complimentary amenities eg. razor, combs, brushes, toothbrushes etc. The beds were very plush and comfortable. There was a complimentary in-room safe, and the TV had quite a few English-language channels (CNN, BBC, NatGeo etc.) They also had French, German, Italian, Chinese and Korean language if you are interested. Some guests have said that you can hear the traffic on the busy highway running outside the hotel. Perhaps you can hear it on the very low floors, but the windows are sound-proofed, double glazed and covered with a transparent film to stop it. On top of that, you can always pull back the curtains. We didn't have any trouble whatsoever with the traffic. The hotel provided a complimentary English-language morning newspaper (Wall Street Journal, International Herald Tribune etc.) and filtered ice cubes are available. If you need anything in your room, contact Instant Service. They answer the second you press the button and in whatever language you speak, and they are able to provide anything that you might want in your room.The hotel has a business centre equipped with many brand new Sony Computers. The cost is reasonable, ¥525 for 15minutes. However, i think in a business-style hotel like the IC they should at least give you a few minutes free to check email, 10 minutes should be sufficient.Now onto attractions in and around Tokyo. The Roppongi Hills area around the hotel is very nice. There are lots of restaurants, shops, convenience stores etc. The area is popular with foreign tourists and is well policed. The area is quite busy 24/7 and you feel safe. The Akasaka area on the other side of the hotel is also good. In the Roppongi Hills area is the Mori Tower. It is taller than the Tokyo Tower and has a good viewing deck. I think the Mori viewing deck is better because you can see further, and you can also get a good view of Tokyo Tower from the top. Take my advice and go to the Mori Tower if you want a nice view of Tokyo.Around Tokyo are many small wards, such as Shibuya, Ikebukoro, Shinjuku, Asakusa, Ginza etc. We took two days of our trip to go around the city. I recommend visiting the Tsukiji Fish Market in the morning for some fun!Outside of the city you should try and visit Mt. Fuji, Hakone and Nikko. Only go to the Mt. Fuji and Hakone area if the day looks nice. You can go to Yokohama, but I didn't think that it looked very appealing for tourists, more of a business city.The concierge at the hotel is very helpful, and can assist with getting around the city. The best staff member experience we had was with the Director of Guest Services. He was French and was very helpful in assisting us, as he was extremely fluent in English while the other staff were just OK. He came and asked us how our day was going, and was able to give us an excellent restaurant recommendation.There are many dining options I can recommend. The hotel has like 5 restaurants, 3 bars and a bakery. The Cascade Cafe has a dinner buffet for a regular price of ¥7000. However, they were having a July special and we got ¥1000 off. They had a lot of choice, and there were chefs preparing food right in front of you. The only downside at the restaurant was that the staff were slow in taking you used plates away.The Delica Shop in the hotel is a small bakery, and they sell heaps of freshly baked bread and patiserie items at reasonable prices, less than ¥400 for everything except cakes.If you go on the Japanese version of the hotels website they have a discount coupon available. I can't read Japanese, but I translated it and found the coupon. Look in the restaurant section. Note that this is not the IHG website, this is the hotel's private website. You can get 10% off all the restaurants and 5% off at the Delica Shop.I highly recommend going to Precce in the Tokyo Midtown complex. It is a high-end supermarket and you can pick up rice, noodles, tempura, beef, chicken etc. They also sell wines, cheese, sashimi etc. They also have a preparation area so you can warm up your food and they provide cutlery. Prices are reasonable. All of us ate for less than about ¥6000 with drinks, dessert and meal.The Guest Services director recommended Umaya to us for Japanese food. All the concierge people recommend this restaurant because of its high quality food. We went for lunch and had an excellent set menu for ¥1500 each.The hotel is close to the Roppongi-Itchome, Roppongi and Tameike Sanno stations. From Tameike Sanno you can walk underground to another station, so it is basically two stations in one. Ask at the hotel for a metro map and figure out which station best suits you, or ask the concierge for the subway directions to your destination. The JR Lines only run in the Shibuya-Shinjuku-Ikebukoro area and the Tokyo Station area.We didn't use it, but the hotel can arrange a limousine, taxi or bus transfer to Narita or Haneda airport at a fee.If you are going to be using taxis, or asking for directions to the hotel, say that you want to go to the Zennikku. That is how the Japanese say ANA. In addition, you could ask for concierge to write down the name and address in Japanese.I hope this review helps you choose a hotel in Tokyo. I highly recommend this hotel because it is good value and has excellent service. We loved the place except for the slow table service at the Cascade Cafe.

I selected the hotel for its location and competitive room pricing. Since my previous visit the hotel has affiliated with Intercontinental and renovated the rooms. But there was more to appreciate than the new badge and the room reformations. Staff quality has definitely improved -- you'll find foreign faces at the front desk and on the floor. In years past, even some of the best Tokyo hotels had trouble with staff communicating with non-Japanese speakers. Even though I speak Japanese, I found it effortless to communicate with most staff in either English or Japanese. The room was clean, modern, efficient and functional. My only complaint here, a common traveler's lament, was the daily charge for internet in the room. I sampled two restaurants: the sushi bar (no complaints here) and the lobby lounge, where I had the breakfast buffet. The charge for the buffet, I thought, at about 40 dollars, was way too high. There are cheaper eating options in the attached Ark Mori complex. There is no doubt that the entry in the past couple of years of foreign super-luxury hotels into the Tokyo market has forced the traditional second-tier properties to upgrade as well. Being walking distance to Akasaka and Roppongi the ANA is an attractive choice for business and leisure travelers.","Alexandria, Virginia","7J1AIL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia</strong>",308,4.0

Just go visit the bar (which by the way is on the 3F) and watch in awe as your drink is placed precisely in front of you and served immaculately. Or go to the panorama bar (actual name is the Manhattan Room) on 36F and sip a Mojito whilst looking out over the city lights. That has to rank as one of the most romantic locations I've ever been. Pity I was on a business trip!The rooms are again precisely set out with Japanese attention to detail. Every conceivable amenity is there for you (iron, kettle, bar, snacks, very comprehensive bathroom bits and bobs). The style is sort of Frank Lloyd Wright with lots of darker wood. The bed compares closely to the Marriott Heavenly Bed. Actually a bit soft for my preference but luxurious.If you are leaving from here to go Narita the Limousine Bus goes from here. You can buy your ticket from the hotel and put it on your bill. I checked out and gave them my bags, then went off to a meeting for the morning. On returning in time for the 12.30 bus, without any further query on my part my bags were brought right to the point where the bus leaves, and were loaded for me. That was very cool.I only had one meal here, a lunch in the bar. It was terrific and presented with great style (great ""plating"" as they say).

Everything is in good order, but there is not much to wow you. The size is okay for central Tokyo. The furnishings are nice, though a little old (particularly the carpeting). The beds are comfortable but nothing like the fancy mattresses in most upscale hotels in the US these days.The bathroom feel especially outdated. The bathtub and the tiles are right out of the 1970s or 1980s. The shower curtains are quite utilitarian. The towels provided are merely average. I think you should get more from this level of hotel.The gym on the 6th floor is not bad. The equipment is relatively new and well maintained. If you are staying on a corporate or government plan, you can use the gym for free.Internet access in the rooms is provided by Ethernet jacks (not WiFi). Cat-5 LAN cables are in the desk drawer to connect your computer. As with the gym, if you are staying on a corporate or government plan, Internet access is free.Noise can be an issue if you are staying on the side facing the the elevated expressway. Cars and motorcycles zoom by at all hours of the night. I recommend asking for a room on the Tokyo Tower side of the hotel if you wish for peace and quiet.The level of service from the staff is good. They are both polite and helpful. No complaints on this front.Overall, the ANA InterContinental is a solid choice for business travelers. You won't be lacking anything.","Washington, DC","govt_traveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",55,4.0

There are not very many restaurants near the hotel, and the eateries in the hotel are quite costly. Tokyo is a spotlessly clean city and very easy to get around via the metro system. Walking, however, is another matter as few streets have street signs. Although I have a very good sense of bearing and direction, I never was able to discern north, south, east or west....odd!

The hotel is absolutley stunning, the lobby is beautiful. We were originally meant to be staying on the 19th floor, but when they found out we were on our honeymoon they bumped us up to the 24th floor, which i think was an upgraded room. The room was lovely and larger than i had expected from some of the reviews on here, the bathroom was quite small but wasnt a problem in the slightest. The view from our window was amazing, we could see the Tokyo tower (see my photos), i spent ages just sat in the window doing my ''Lost In Translation'' thing, just looking out over the city. The room was so clean, the in-room amenities were really good, really nice shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, plus you get toothbrushes, tooth paste, razor, brush, comb, plus the usual shower caps, sewing kits, stocked mini-bar, tea & coffee facilities etc... we also had an iron and ironing board, hair dryer, fridge, safe, slippers, Japanese style robes and dressing gowns. Nice flat screen TV, 2 english channels (i think they were CNN and BBC world news) we loved watching the wacky japanese night-time tv shows. The closest metro station was Tomeike-Sanno, which was literally a 2 minute walk away, and right on the Ginza line. The metro was so easy to use, we bought open day tickets every day which cost about 700Yen each (you can pay extra for tickets that include use of the Toei line, but we never needed to use this, you can get every where just with the metro lines). To get to and from Narita airport we used the Limousine Bus, which was really good, friendly staff and really clean and comfortable coaches, took about an hour and a half to get to the hotel, it cost 6000Yen each, for one way. The hotel is in a good location, not noisy at all. A few convenience stores close by (we mainly used the 7/11 next to the metro station to buy snacks and drinks) Most nights we walked down to Roppongi from the hotel, which was only about a 15-20 minute walk, which is great for shopping, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants as they did seem quite expensive, even a cup of coffee was over 1000Yen, (but totally worth it, te best Cappuccino i've ever had!) because we were staying for quite a while the hotel gave us ten tickets for complimentary coffees for use in either the Atruim Lounge or the Cascade Cafe. The hotel staff were so friendly and helpful, but then every Japanese person we met were exactly the same, so courteous, friendly and polite. The hotel staff spoke really good english, but not everywhere else did, luckily my husband speaks Japanese so we got on perfectly fine, so before you go i would definately recommend you learn at least the basics or you will struggle when out and about, and in shops and restaurants. I would definatley recommend going to the Asakusa Kannon Temple, Tokyo Tower, Harajuku, the Meiji Shrine, the Imperial Palace and Akihabara. We went on a day trip with the JTB Sunrise tours to Mount Fuji and Hakone (which could be booked at the hotel, but we booked beforehand with Expedia), sadly for us the day we had picked for our trip we had terrential rain and Mt. Fuji was so entirely shrouded in mist and cloud that we didnt actaully see it! We were totally gutted as the day after the weather was beautiful. Overall we really had the best holiday ever and cant wait to go back and will definatly go back to the ANA Intercontinental again. We booked our trip wit Expedia, and it cost just over £2000 for the two of us including our return flights with BA. (we flew from Heathrow Terminal 5 which was absolutely fine, despite all of their current problems).  -- Check out my photos ---","Birmingham, United Kingdom","kaylouise</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, United Kingdom</strong>",31,5.0

All staff are professional, efficient, competent and impeccable. The lobby is airy and relaxing with water effects, plants, etc. There is a small shopping arcade which includes clothing & accessory boutiques, convenience store, flowers, bakery, etc. There are several somewhat pricey restaurants in the hotel. The common areas of the hotel are immaculate.The room had nice lighting, a flat panel TV, small frig, hot water pot, desk, small sofa (some of the ANA room sofas are so small as to preclude sitting), an overly firm mattress, great comforter/duvet and the most wonderful soft fluffy pillows. Two types of robes are provided - traditional western and yukata. The plumbing was excellent. A fabulous shower/tub with superb water flow (wish my home bath was like this!). The mirror was fog free, the toilet the usual many functioned Japanese toilet. There were complimentary toothbrushes, toothpaste, sewing kit, cotton tips, etc.There was complimentary instant coffee, ""plum tea"" (more of a salt broth type flavor), and green tea (bag type) - however, all were of low quality. The hotel location is good for riding the Metro - located between two subway stations. A variety of dining nearby. There is a great little grocery store (Pororoca) less than 2 blocks away that has fresh produce, and a variety of drinks, snacks, chocolates, etc. at reasonable prices. I have stayed at the ANA Tokyo many times, the most recent being after the Intercontinental acquisition of ANA hotels. Prior to the takeover, I stayed on the club floor. This last stay was on a non-club floor. So I'm not sure if some of the changes are due to the new owners or just the difference between the club floor and regular floors. I say all that to say this: the standard room of this most recent stay (after IC takeover) had bulk toiletries in the shower - large dispensers of shampoo, conditioner and soap, all Shiseido brand and smelled nice. There was a bulk soap dispenser at the sink. Conspicuously absent was LOTION. My stays on the club floor prior to the takeover, I seem to remember all kinds of charming little toiletries, including lotions, all individual sized. With the current airport restrictions on liquids/gels, I have come to depend more on hotel toiletries. I never used them before, but now I find I carry only the most unique (to me) items that will fit in the quart size bag - and rely on the hotel to supply the (more common) rest. So the absence of lotion was annoying. Sooo - whether the absence of toiletries was due to non-club floor or the new IC way of doing things, I'm not sure.The only negatives that were experienced with this stay were minor: the pens in the room were cheesy and wouldn't write - they replaced them and the next batch was fine; the hairdryer on the ""cool"" and ""set"" settings was useless unless you have three days to dry your hair - the high setting worked OK; the weight scale didn't work, probably due to dead battery. The used glasses and tea cups were not sanitized - apparently just rinsed off in the sink at best - which often doesn't actually get them clean. For me personally, this is intolerable. Makes me wonder if they are sanitized or just rinsed after the last guest!!! And I do not care to re-use MY OWN glass without sanitizing it between uses. Overall, this hotel is an excellent value. A similar level of atmosphere/service in the USA would cost three times what I paid here. And I have stayed here enough times to find them to be consistently superior. Whether the new IC ownership will change this remains to be seen.",California,"Annh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",107,5.0

However, this hotel cost me $350 less per night than the other places (I booked on a Japanese travel site called Jalan).The Manhatten Lounge on the 36th floor, in my opinion, was just as good, if not better than the bar at the NY Grill at the Park Hyatt.

The multi-lingual hotel staff was quite helpful, and the currency exchange was quite fair, unlike my experiences in other cities where you would expect to take a beating for the convenience.

The process was easy and even though we booked an advance purchase rate, my credit card was only charged upon check-out.LocationThe hotel is pretty well located (Akasaka) with access to the subway within 5 minutes by foot. There are 4 subway lines accessible - the Ginza line is closest (300m) and the others are up to 1km away, all underground. The hotel is not too far from Roppongi - cab fare is Y600 - Y800. It's about Y1,500 from Tokyo station by cab.Check-InCheck-In was a smooth process. We arrived a little early and were accommodated (the hotel didn't seem very full) straight away. Staff were friendly and polite (common theme throughout the country).RoomsThe room was of a decent size. We were able to accommodate 2 full sized suitcases without tripping over them. We were on the 20th floor and had a decent view looking towards Roppongi. Housekeeping was a little slow though, our room would only be made up in the late afternoon which is not optimal when you head back lunch time for a rest.I really struggled with the bed, it wasn't comfortable at all. Furthermore, the standard pillows were way too soft, so I requested hard ones and these were like bricks. I didn't sleep at all well any of the 3 nights we spent at the hotel.The mini-bar was well stacked, but prices were as you'd expect in a 5-star hotel and we didn't partake.MealsMeals inside the hotel were on the expensive side and with so much on offer in a fantastic city like Tokyo, we only ate one breakfast at the hotel. The breakfast buffet itself was brilliant, but a little costly. We certainly attempted to eat enough for value! There are a couple of cheaper places in the adjoining arcade if you're looking to spend a little less, but still enjoy close-by convenience.PoolThe pool looked good (from our hotel window), but we didn't actually use it. We didn't see anyone swimming, although it was quite hot and humid.Concierge / ActivitiesThe friendliness and assistance provided by the concierge was extremely welcome. There was always a knowledgable English speaking person at the desk, who was eager to assist and they provided us with some valuable tips to maximise time efficiency.The business centre was well equipped, although once again, the prices were a bit on the high side. I think Internet access cost approx Y500 for 15 minutes. The lobby was large, airy and elegant.Check-outOnce again a smooth process although it took a while to convince them to give a short check-out extension as we had a time-clash with our Imperial Palace excursion. They were able to store our luggage for the remainder of the day.OverallThere is nothing wrong with the hotel, but my feeling towards it is neutral, considering the price one has to pay. Whilst we got a good deal for a 5-star hotel, I have stayed in other 5-star hotels worldwide where my experiences have been standout and the prices have been comparable or better. I would probably select a different hotel next time I'm in Tokyo.","Sydney, Australia","AussieRhino</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",149,3.0

I’m very surprised someone grumbled it wasn’t up to Intercontinental standards, I’ve stayed in over a dozen Intercontinentals and it certainly is. If you get the right room. We were booked into a standard room (generally floors less than 20) The room wasn’t too bad,but just a little tired looking. The furniture is the same as in the superior rooms, it just appears to have been more used. The rooms are much larger than what we expected for Tokyo. You can get a view of Tokyo Tower if you really want to. The station was a bit of a hike, about 15 minutes, which was a bit of a downside. Also, the bathroom while nice had a shower curtain instead of a glass door, but otherwise the bathroom was top notch. Note that in a standard room, you get the fairly sad Intercontinental own brand of toiletries, but in the superior rooms you get really nice Elemis(a top spa brand) toiletries. This is an easy way to figure out if you are in a standard or superior room. I’m sorry to say but in our second stay, we got put in a standard and we were told it was a superior. If it wasn’t for the fact that we had been in a superior, we would have been none the wiser. So be careful about this. However, we were put into a club room when we complained, which intriguingly was smaller, but it did have a nice view and of course lounge access. Didn’t eat in the restaurants, but I met Iron Chef Hiroyuki Sakai in the lobby so I’m sure the food must have been of a high standard. Meeting him was a big high point for me, and if you are an Iron Chef fan, Chen Kenichi’s restaurant is also nearby. Feel free to email me if you want more Iron Chef information, we went to most of their restaurants. As mentioned by others, the airport bus goes straight there, just under 1 hour if there’s minimal traffic, 1.5hrs if there is. Don’t even think about trying to use the train if you have anything more than hand carry luggage, even if you can find the lifts(we couldn’t) the path to the hotel is still very long. Additionally, everyone in the train and station will hate you. Spend the $30 for the bus.",Singapore,"miltonmao</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",71,5.0

The rooms are large enough - i.e., you won't feel claustrophobic and there is enough room for 2 people to room together comfortably. Free internet access. The bathrooms are nice & clean (I'm very picky about bathrooms). The staff speaks limited English but are very accomodating and polite. Breakfast at the Intercontinental Lounge (for members) was excellent with gorgeous views. Beautiful lobby/atrium. About a 5 minute walk to the Tokyo metro station, with a mall nearby. More impressively, we lost our cell phone (we didn't remember where - train or taxi) and the staff was able to locate it for us within an hour.We also stayed at much more expensive places this trip (Mandarin Oriental Tokyo and Gora Kadan resort in Hakone) and felt the ANA was a better value for the money. Not a super luxurious hotel where one goes to be pampered, but definitely a good balance of price and quality.

We paid 19,500 yen a night for a standard twin room on 26th and 22nd floors (we stayed for four nights initially, and three nights a week later). Both our rooms were pleasantly decorated in a neutral, western style with good lighting, comfortable beds with duvets and flat screen TV. In particular, the beds were extremely comfortable! Whilst not huge, the design and inclusion of a small seating area in front of the large window providing great views across the Imperial Palace and Diet Building from one room, and the Tokyo Tower and Roppongi in the other, gave some sense of space. The bathrooms in both rooms were adequate- unlike the room decor and furnishings these don't appear to have been upgraded recently.Our first room, on the Imperial Palace side of the building, suffered from condensation- the picture window would mist up and in the morning was covered in condensation. There was no sign of damp in the room and the problem seemed confined to the window itself, but still it was annoying as it meant missing out on an amazing view. Looking from outside the Hotel, it seemed this was a problem for some other rooms too.Other than a bit of a wait at check-in for our first stay because of a french film festival being hosted at the Ark Hills concert hall, service was efficient and helpful. The conceirge secured us a great table at the Park Hyatt New York Grill for lunch and booked our spaces on the bus back to Narita without fuss. Communal areas are attractive with lots of comfortable seating.Breakfast (buffet) at the hotel was very good indeed, with a wide choice of Western and Japanese options, and more reasonably priced at than the other hotels we stayed in Japan. In the immediate vicinity to the hotel there are some restaurants dotted around the Ark Hills Complex. Aux Baccanales provides acceptable french standards and has a good range of wines by the glass. The Andersens bakery/cafe provides an excellent, filling breakfast for 650-800 yen.We very much liked the location of the hotel- the immediate vicinity is reasonably quiet, being next to the Ark Hills Complex with its gardens and the American Embassy behind- and you can walk to the Imperial Palace, Ginza and Akasaka within 15 minutes each, and there's a subway station just outside the hotel.

The service is courteous with superb attention to detail. The breakfast is very adequate. The bathroom is tiny and basic but cleanly maintained (and slightly larger than most Tokyo hotels already). They charge hotel guests Y1000 to use the pool and that made my daugther very upset but she was soon pleased when the hotel gave her a ANA children's toy package as a gift (those they give away on ANA planes). The hotel is about 15seconds walk from Exit 13 of the Tameike Sanno subway station,which is around 200m from the station itself. Sadly the station only serves the Ginza line and to go to major shopping places like Shinjuku, Ikebukuro or Ginza, you need to change to the Marunouchi line at Akasaka Mitsuke, which is convenient. Taxi from Tokyo station and Shinjuku costs Y1300 and Y2100 respectively. Roppongi Hills is just up the road but there is no convenient public transport to get there from ANA (except taxis). To walk from Roppongi Hills to ANA Hotel is easier as it is a 15 minute downhill walk.Overall, I strongly recommend ANA Hotel for business visitors to Tokyo. The attention to detail is impressive. I have stayed in 9 other Tokyo hotels and this is amongst the best. However, for family on holidays with a focus on shopping and visiting places like Disneysea etc, the location in a business / office area is not always so convenient, especially if you don't like to walk long distances.
