Please read as this propery manager is a fraud!!!Booked 5 nights in their apartments - wow the most unorganised operation I've stayed at and dark shadow of shame on Hawai'i and it's normally hospitable reputation.We booked for 3 adults in an apartment with a futon. Had to ask the staff for linen for myself - and I mean all sheets and towels. The receptionist responded with 'oh, you want sheets too?'.....um what? I'm sleeping on a leather fold down lounge, yes a sheet would be nice!?There was no Doona or blanket etc - luckily it was too hot to sleep with those anyway because the air conditioning unit is on the floor in the main bedroom and doesn't cool the living area unless you leave it on for hours and cool the bedroom into a fridge.Speaking of fridge, HS401 Apartment is where we stayed and that fridge leaked on the floor the whole time. I reported it but no one came to fix it. So we had to use tea towels to soak up the water pooling on the floor.Everyday I had to ask for a towel as the housekeeper would take 3 and only ever replace it with 2.I will remind you we booked and paid for 3 people to stay.This was so they would get tips to return a sufficient amount of towels to us. Lucky for me, I'm not an idiot.We were never given dishwashibg liquid or cloths to clean. It was so gross.In the end we spoke to Patrick the manager - we had a second booking (Stupidly we booked non refundable rates) to return too and under the poor service and state of the rooms we weren't coming back. Patrick agreed to cancel without fees to our faces but proceeded to tell my mother he was going to 'no show our booking' and for us to 'ignore booking.com's email so booking.com didn't charge'.Again, lucky I'm not an idiot, sadly couldn't say the same for Patrick....So in my 15 years as a travel agent and 5 years as an accommodation manager myself...I knew he was as full of koi poo as I had thought.No show a booking and ignoring booking.com means you didnt advise sufficient cancellation notice. But Patrick wanted us to do him a favour so his 'booking.com ratings weren't affected and he didn't have to pay the 18% commission '.After departing so we could soak to booking.com about the fraudulent claims he was making, Patrick charged our card. We've disputed it but to be honest we literally had such a terrible stay, refund or not we were never going back. So we paid much higher rates at Outrigger Beach Resort and had actual sheets and towels and no leaking fridge or dodgy staff.So, reader....if you've made it to this point I would cross off HS Hotel and their Apartments and head over to a reliable source like TripAdvisor and find something much nicer with someone running the place who doesn't want to build themselves a poor reputation and operates honestly.Surfjack around the corner looked quite nice with onsite pool and coffee shop...all the best for your Waikiki stay!","Gymea, Australia","RGT169</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gymea, Australia</strong>",11,1.0

The rooms have good facilities (kitchenette, spare beds, fridge / freezer etc.) and the apartment is very big. However the air conditioning in the room was incredibly loud, I can usually sleep through anything but even I could not sleep through the sound of this. In the end I had to get up and turn it off and then had trouble sleeping because I was so hot instead. Alongside this the pillows are like rocks, I do not for the life of me know why, but I chose to sleep without one at all as they were so hard. I chose to book a hotel as I had an overnight layover here between my flights and wanted peace of mind and a good night's sleep, however I barely slept at all due to the reasons above so I regret booking a room here.I also suffered the service fee surprise that others have mentioned - I only chose this hotel as I thought it was a good price for a private hotel room (77 dollars advertised) however only after booking and paying did I see that I had in fact been charged 122 dollars. As others have mentioned there are way nicer places you could stay for that price, and I wish I had booked somewhere else now. The fact that I didn't even get a good night's sleep in the end just rubs salt in the wound. The place is still getting 3 stars as as I mentioned it was clean and the rooms were big and the staff were friendly enough, however I wouldn't book again or recommend to anyone else.","Leeds, United Kingdom","Sophie A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",7,3.0

No breakfast and no nothing of services but the borrow-some-surf-gear stuff.BUT the big big problem is the windows that aren't there. Instead they had fixed glass blinds that were uncloseable so you got awoken by drunk loud people in the street or the garbage truck or the constant traffic from the long road next to the canal that is across the street.I would give it 3.5-4 stars for value for money if they put in windows and sound isolation.

Managed to quickly grab this low cost ""surfers"" lodging via Booking.com just over an hour before checking in. It's a decent but very comfortable 3* class apartment-style inn, pretty cheap for Waikiki standards with this level of comfort and facilities provided: 1-bedroom apartment, private bathroom, balcony, kitchenette (complete with fridge, microwave, stove, sink, coffee maker with complimentary coffee packs), comfortable queen bed, extra futon-sofas in the living room that can sleep 2 more people (so that means each unit can house 4, and for less that $150 a night that's an awesome deal). It did have some dated furniture and appliances but the hotel took good care of everything to make sure all is in working order so the guests are very comfortable. Overall I rate it 4* because I was comfy and the location was just convenient for us, shopping and beach in the Waikiki area within walking distance.Note: Later we were upgraded to another apartment under the same company in the next block, due to plumbing issues caused by a burst pipeline on Sept 12 (this is not not the hotel's fault; city was actively working on repairing it).

Behind the hotel about 7-10 mins walk is the shopping area then the Waikiki Beach. The hotel is simple, about 6 floors, clean, friendly staff. We had a room with a kitchenette. Pots, pans, plates, etc. were available. The staff was helpful if you needed kitchen utensils when anything was missing from the kitchenette. Sheets looked clean, the room smelled clean. No problems with internet or water. There was a porch with a good view of the canal. We had 2 beds, which was a bonus for us. Guess the single bed was sold out. Negatives: The slide door could have a safer latch. The curtain was stuck in a closed position. Beware of extra hotel fees per day (service fees), beware of expensive parking fees, beware of late fees when you arrive after midnight (even 3 mins late!). The late night arrival fee is unacceptable! (We have limited control over flight and transportation times. These features are built into their tourism framework.) The attendant made up for the late fee by being kind about the parking fee. The cleaning staff seemed efficient, but I found a GPS holder under the bed from the last guest so that left a question in my mind. If that bed was stripped between guests and the floor properly cleansed there should be no holder there. Nice to know: there is street parking if you don't mind walking 10 mins some nights. I would stay there again, unless I get a cheaper hotel (same rating or better). I like most things about the hotel. The hotel fees were the most expensive part of our trip. If you don't need a fancy posh hotel, this is fine. No pool or gym room, but there's a lovely beach 10 mins walk away and walking paths with fresh air.

We were a little weary because of the resort fees but in the end, with list of priorities of what we want in a property during our 2 week stay, this was the property. Staff were all excellent from management, reception to cleaning staff. Location---excellent. Our room/apt was also very satisfying. Yes, it was a little dated, but very clean and sufficient. Here we found value, cleanliness, kitchen facilities, daily maid service, strong wifi connection, very helpful and friendly reception. We had a neighbour who was did not allow us to sleep, and it was dealt with professionally.Yes, as other reviewers have noted, there is noise from the street below, but it is Waikiki Beach and the windows open for fresh air which is what was important to us. At night we heard sirens, but no place is perfect and in our minds, still deserves a 5 star rating. Parking is expensive, as is at any property in Waikiki therefore we decided to rent every 2nd or 3rd day from morning to late evening, one day at a time to not incur parking fees. There is a convenient car rental across the street, which provided us with excellent customer service (Enterprise). For the added daily fee of being located in the beach area, it was something we didn't mind paying.Finally, do your research ahead of time from home before booking, and take a chance in the end, coming with an open mind (even after 10-12 hours of air travel). Non-refundable means just that in all of Waikiki Beach -- ""non - refundable"" , as we discovered with another property here we were trying to cancel in order to stay more days here.

Not so nice if you have to carry the bags over again for another 300m. The ladies at the reception were very nice and helpfull, one of them even went with us all the way down to the annex to show us where it is.The annex is an old, somewhat dodgy looking apartament building from ( I guess ) the 50s. At first it doesnt make a good impression, especially the lift which is old, very dirty and smelly. To access the building you need a hotel card for the lift so no strange individuals around - the entire building belongs to the hotel.In fact, you don't get a room but a huge one bedroom apartament with a big balcony, fully equiped kitchen, bath, flatscreen tv etc, air condition, etc. much better than a plain hotel room if you ask me. The rooms are dated, the design is a weird japanese style, but very very clean and really functional. The beds were new and quite comfy. The stove in the kitchen is a museum piece from the 50s but works perfectly and I kinda loved that thing :) It takes a few hours to get used to the apartament especially if you have expected a regular hotel room but I have to say that I really enjoyed the apartament, especially the balcony at night from which you get a nice partial view over the canal and the hills. I would prefer the annex to the hotel itself anytime! The location was great - 2 blocks / 10 minutes walk away from the famous Waikiki Beach, one block away from the Kuhio Blvd with all the shops etc. the closest ABC shop is 5 mintes walk away. You can also easily walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre along the canal - that would be a 20 minutes walk. You'll be faster on foot than taking the bus :)The nearest bus stop is on Kuhio blvd a few minutes walk from the hotel - you can the bus to the airport, Pear Harbour, Ala Moana, China town. etc from there. The ride is always 2.50 $ - no change can be given by the driver so make sure you have small notes in your pocket. Remeber - the ticket is valid for around 3 hours so you can hop off if you like and take another bus then ( regardless which route as far it is going in the same direction ) without having to pay twice! Word of advice if you on a budget - you have afully equiped kitchen so use it. Get the bus to China Town, ( 20 minutes ride ) do your shopping there - the grocery prices are like 30- 50% lower than in Waikiki. And believe me Hawaii is the most expnsive place I have ever visited.Over the entire stay, the room was cleaned on daily basis, the towels were also changed daily. The housekepping lady comes in the afternoon, around 3-4pm just that you know ;). The WiFi was not the fastest but still acceptable for internet browsing Etc. NO BUGS of any kind spotted at any time in or around the annex - which is an isue in some of the Waikiki hotels. They keep the property very clean I have to say.Now one HUGE ISSUE for light sleepers - the annex and the hoteal are located right at the Ala Wai Blvd. which is a VERY BUSY AND NOISY STREET. The windows are hawaiian style movable glas panel windows which you can close but the will not cut the street noise at all and you will hear the street 24/7. Solution - ear plugs + the air con running on fan setting at night = whitenoise. That did the trick for me and I am a light sleeper.Overall - would I stay again? Definitely! In fact, should I ever visit Waikiki again I will stay in the annex. It is not the Hilton or Sheraton, it is dated but I really enjoyed my stay here.","Dublin, Ireland","Agnus D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",32,3.0

Also, from the lanai, I had a partial view of Ala Wai Canal, and the land beyond. The real view was out the front door. Did have a decent sized kitchen area with microwave, small coffe maker, and a full sized refrigerator. Excellent wi-fi.The Bad - Minor items are no telephone in the room, no channel guide for the TV, and the room and decor is quite dated, while the stove looks like it dates back almost to the time Hawaii became a state. The ice trays in the freezer really, really, really need replacing. If you are sensitive to street noise you will not like it here, as Ala Wai is a busy street and gets sirens on it at night. I am a heavy sleeper so it was not an issue. There is a resort fee, but I am unsure why, as there is no poo, and nothing resort-like about being down in the annex (which I think was an apartment/condo building).The Ugly - The entire week I was there, there was a toilet siting out by the curb. Technically, sometime towards the end of my stay, someone broke the toilet, so it was only pieces of a toilet sitting by the curb. The general area may seem a bit sketchy, but in reality it is a nice area. Also, the location of the a/c unit is a bit odd (almost on the floor, but as the suite is configured it is theonly place it could go.If you are looking for a place to stay in Waikiki that is not pricey and is convenient to a variety of tasty little eateries and Waikiki in general, and are a heavy sleeper, and you do not plan to spend a lot of time in the room, then this place is fine. i would go back.",,CarlH1540,26,3.0

I was dumb enough to screw up our bookings where we forgot 1 night so had to add on an extra night through online. Upon arrival, to save confusion Edmond helped secure us the same room for both nights (it was even larger than the one we had booked) so we wouldn't have to check out and check back in again. Kudos to the staff who work hard into the late hours - they're still there at 11pm!It's an old hotel that require renovations but who cares! Everything functions well, A/C worked great, bathroom did it's job (although there's no fan), and you have a clean comfortable bed to sleep in which is what counts. You're only 1 block away from the hub of Waikiki main street which is an amazing bonus.TIP: If you're tight on budget and don't want to pay $20 per night for booking, be smart and park on the strip next to the canal. It's hard to get parking, but it's well worth the try (the longest drove around was 45 minutes, but simply doing that saved us 3 days worth of parking ($60 for those who struggle with numbers)). Be wary of the parking rules - it's something like free parking all the time EXCEPT Mondays and Fridays from 8am-11am. So what we did was organise our time around this. On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and the weekend we left our car in the same spot and explored the neighbouring areas - basically anywhere that didn't require a car. On Monday, we organised to get up early and see Manoa Falls and on Friday, Diamond Head. So just be wise, we certainly weren't going to pay for parking for the 9 days we were in Honolulu and, no pun intended, but it paid off! :D",,Lisa T,18,5.0

It's very affordable (the studio priced at $70/night, but with fees and taxes it came out to $100/night). Pros of the place:Has a kitchen (with fridge, oven, cupboards) which is great if you want to cook and/or store food. The studio was huge for one person (had separate bedroom, large living space, and separate bathroom).Centrally located - shops and restaurants are one block away; and Waikiki beach is 10 minutes away.Parking is available on premises; cost is $15/night if you pre-register.The staff is very friendly.However they are some caveats staying here. Cons of the place:It's noisy - they've two buildings on Ala Wai. Ala Wai is a very busy street, with lots of traffic. They put me into the second building initially, but it was so noisy I could barely go to sleep. I was then moved into the main building; and I requested a room on Nonohani, furthest away from Ala Wai. The room was much quieter, but still, I had to wear ear plugs when sleeping (I'm sensitive to noise).There's no amenities - there's no lobby, just the front desk. If you want a hotel with all the nice trappings, this is not the place for you. The building is old; looks like out of the 1970's. There's no elevator to the garage; and the elevator is slow.Basically it's a no frills kind of hotel. If you're OK with that, then you're good.

The hotel is nice and clean with big rooms and staff were initially great - due to international dateline issues we had wrongly booked one night out but staff graciously sorted this issue :)The final price of $135 was much higher than the $92 price on booking.com even taking into account the taxes to add. The big surprising difference? A $29 service charge that booking.com says ""'is not included....(but further down after listing the taxes).....any charges not included in the total price must be paid at the property''. At the property a notice advertises the service charge for 'those desiring a more full service package without having to pay a la carte for selected items''. The staff argued that thru booking.com the fee is mandatory but the wording on booking.com combined with that at the hotel seems open to interpretation to me? I told the staff that I was not happy at being forced to pay the fee but they made no gesture or effort beyond reiterating the mandatory nature for booking.com clients. The hospitality industry is all about customer satisfaction so if a customer says they are unhappy and staff make no effort over the issue (in this case a value of about $20) then how can I rate the hotel any better than poor? :(Since we also came late at last minute, we got one of the last car spots where 3 cars park in a queue. If one of the guests blocked in by you needs to leave early (say at 6 in the morning) then you will get woken up to move your car!In conclusion my stay was spoiled by the nasty surprise of the room being about 30% more than I anticipated . If you are booking online (thru booking.com at least) compare this hotel against others in the $130-140 night bracket ather than those at $90-100.

Reserved through Booking.com. It looked like it was cheapest available ($77/night) .. BUT ...

Book some other hotel instead. For $100 a night you can get free wifi, continental breakfast and possibly parking.You don't really need a car in Waikiki. The bus service is excellent, but we rented one for a day to go on a trip to north shore. Paid the parking fee because impossible to find street parking in the area.No breakfast of any kind, no coffee (except for that cheap coffee maker in the room)A tiny, old style tv.

I purchased the deal in October through Priceline under the going rate. The room was clean and we used the kitchenette for breakfast as another money saving tactic. The only air conditioning unit was in the bedroom, so we left it on day and night with the door open to cool the front room. Several great cheap restaurants were nearby and it was a quick walk to the beach Although the room was not soundproof and adjacent to a busy street, we had little trouble sleeping after a day sightseeing or swimming. My only complaint was that the trundle futon was hard as a rock, so we had to stack the two futons. Parking is scarce in Waikiki, but is available under the hotel for $20 a night.

I'm a light sleeper so used my earplugs every night.

The bed wasn't all that comfortable either.The bathroom also had a few drawbacks. First, to flush the toilet you had to hold down the lever for about 3 seconds (otherwise nothing would happen). Also, the shower head sprayed water very wide and there was no way to adjust the head to spray straight. These things were little annoyances.Another thing worth noting is that they don't offer free wi-fi. They charge $13/day and you have to buy it for the whole length of your stay, which is crazy.

Everyone typically stays at the Waikiki Banyan but when my g/f couldn't make it due to work commitments, I decided to search for a cheaper option that still had a kitchen. Location wasn't a major concern for me, as I've found that everything is within walking distance; from this hotel it's about a 35-40 minute walk to Safeway from this hotel, a 10-15 minute walk to the beach, and about a 20-25 minute walk to Kapialani Park.The Holiday Surf Hotel seemed to meet my criteria, and for the price I paid the room and furnishings were about what I expected...maybe a little lower in standards. The size was fine, and it had everything I needed so for the most part it was satisfactory. The dishes and cooking instruments provided were perfect, and the room and items in it were all clean and well kept. However, the drapes were very thin and since my room was facing Ala Wai Boulevard, with all the street lighting my room was lit 24/7. The A/C was also very weak (I had to pull the mattress off the bed and lie it on the floor right next to the A/C unit) so combined with the light pollution, it was difficult to get to sleep.The highlight of this hotel is definitely the people running it. Anytime I had a question the ladies at the front desk were more than happy to help answer them, whether it was regarding the best shops to get food, which farmer's market to go to, or helping me find a local SIM card for my phone. If they didn't know, they'd find out and call me in my room with the information. Service with a smile goes a long way.The low point of this hotel, and the reason my rating is so low, is the water quality. I'm an experienced traveler and have been to many countries outside North America (India, Africa, Mexico, Europe) where water quality is a concern. But when visiting places within North America, I expect that the tap water should be drinkable and in previous visits to Waikiki -- albeit staying at a different hotel -- this has not been an issue. But at the Holiday Surf it was.I arrived on Thursday and with the heat, I started drinking a lot of water. I'm thirsty after flying and since the lacrosse tournament started the next day, and ran over the weekend, I also needed to hydrate. By Friday night, I noticed some slight stomach cramping; like a more severe hunger pang. Over the course of Saturday and Sunday, it got worse and while I didn't notice it while playing in the tournament, when I wasn't playing it was very uncomfortable. By Monday morning, it was very painful. I suspected the water was the reason because it was the only thing that had changed. I bought the same groceries that I do at home, and hadn't eaten out since my arrival (I like to keep my food intake consistent during competitions). As a test, I stopped drinking the tap water and 6 hours later, the cramping had subsided significantly. The next morning, my stomach was almost back to normal, so to test the theory further I drank 1 glass of tap water. Within 30 minutes, the cramps were back.At that point I simply bought several jugs of bottled water from the store and I had no further issues the rest of the week. I'm not sure if this hotel is just older and has some issues with their own pipes but as I mentioned, I've drank from the Waikiki water supply before with no problems. Draw your own conclusions as to whether this hotel is for you. If you are like many of my teammates and you buy water whenever you travel, then I would definitely urge you to consider the Holiday Surf. I stated the service was excellent, and with a sleep mask to combat the light issue this would be a solid place to stay at an economical price. But I couldn't give it a higher rating based on the issues/concerns I had regarding the tap water.","Surrey, Canada","vrecksler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Surrey, Canada</strong>",61,2.0

While staying here nobody cleaned my room and when I asked to have new towels and sheets they were given to me and was told to do it myself.

Holiday Surf is NOT a Hilton. However, it does have an Hawaiian charm of its own. It is like staying at a friend's house. It is not the most modern, but it is comfy. We had a one bedroom apt in the older section of the hotel. It was a corner unit with a balcony that looked out onto the side street and the canal - and magnificent rainbows. Being diabetics, it was great to have a refrigerator and a stove/oven so we could eat what we wanted, when we wanted. There is a Costco on the way from the airport for stocking up and there are small nearby markets within walking distance. We rented a car for our first few days so we could see other parts of the island. Parking is available (extra fee) at the hotel. We debated whether or not to use the paid parking vs the free parking available along the canal and were glad we paid for parking as we watched cars circling and circling and hovering for a parking space. There was an Enterprise Car Rental office across the street so the next time we will rent a car there for the day or days we want to explore the island. The beach is an easy 3 block walk. The staff at Holiday Surf are outstanding. Always friendly, helpful, professional, and genuinely caring about their guests. The apartment itself was a bit worn looking. While the beds were comfortable, the sofa seemed a relic from a fraternity house. It had a throw covering the worst of the worn bits but it was lumpy and sunken and uncomfortable to sit on. There was another chair but it was only slightly more comfortable. I could see that the apartments were being redone so this may no longer be an issue.The bathroom was clean but could use some paint and grout touchups. Again, this was in the works and may have been taken care of. The AC and ceiling fans were great. The turtles painted on the ceiling always gave me a smile. AC was only needed at times as there was a nice breeze when the balcony doors were open. The kitchen was well provisioned with pots, pans, coffee pot, microwave, etc. There are laundry facilities available at the hotel.

We inquired about this and at the end of the day, the message was, we can't get the room we booked unless we pay more $, even if we booked a certain room configuration through Hotwire. The manager stated that their policy is not to guarantee any room configurations that anyone reserves.  Prior to coming to the hotel, my boyfriend called to make sure they would have dish soap included in the room so we could wash the dishes we use since all rooms were advertised on the website to have a fully equipped kitchenette, with microwave. They said yes, and when we arrived, there was none. We went down to ask for some and the manager said there was a $2 charge! Strange, because my boyfriend made it very clear when he asked whether or not dish soap to provided wash dishes, and the reply he got was that there is a small bottle provided upon our arrival. Even when we brought this to the attention of the manager, he insisted it would be a $2 charge to give us dish soap. Not that we could afford $2, it’s just $2, but the principle that the manager didn’t do anything to correct the misinformation his employees sent out bothered us. Next, we asked why there was no microwave in our room. We got a very long winded and circular explanation on why our room didn’t come equipped with a microwave, and why our solution would be to rent a microwave for $35 (rest of the week) or upgrade our room at an extra cost. I can pretty much buy a new microwave @ Wal-Mart for $35. The bottom line was this: the website describes all their room configurations and all the amenities included. All the rooms described on the website have a microwave included. The manager let us know that their website does not describe all the rooms available and it only advertises the ""deluxe"" rooms. However, they have standard rooms that are not advertised, and apparently those are the ones they allocate to Hotwire, Expedia, Travelocity...etc customers...WHAT?! We had a big issue with this because we frequently had leftovers we wanted to heat, and no matter how much we complained about this discrepancy and misleading advertisement on their website, everyone we spoke with did not care to make us, their customer, satisfied (forget about happy). We even spoke to the manager/owner, Patrick (and his sister Sharon), both of whom were not at all apologetic for the mix up and misleading information on the website, and were even righteous about the whole ordeal. I even posed this question to the Patrick: is it reasonable to assume that we would get a microwave with our room when all the rooms they show on their website have one included? He flat out said no. They were right, and we were wrong. In my humble opinion they should have tried harder to please their customers when this kind of misunderstanding comes up. Parking: there are exactly 7 real parking slots for a 6-floor motel. The first night we came back, no street parking was found so we decided to park in the garage. The parking spaces were small and it made it even more difficult to park because the garage was tiny. There was no space to maneuver your car. It took 10-point turns to park in some of the tight stalls. Next morning, we were pleasantly surprised by the real parking situation we would be dealing with for the whole week we were there...we were blocked by double parking. That was more like a 15-20 maneuver to get out of the space. If we came home late, there was nowhere to park, so we had to be the ones to double park. And in the morning, if someone needed to get out, we get a lovely wake up call to move our car.  Side note on parking: when we booked our room a few months in advance, we called to ask how much parking was… $10/night. We found out when we arrived it had increased to $12/night. Expect to be ripped off for parking if you want to stay in Waikiki. If you want to avoid the crowds and the extreme traffic of Waikiki stay on a different shore. If you want to hang out on the beach and at the resort all day with all the touristy shopping and attractions, no car is needed in Waikiki. Some other noteworthy mentions:1) When we asked for beach towels, we got mismatched old looking bath towels. 2) There were no bowls in the ""fully equipped kitchenette"" so we used mugs to eat our cereal. The mugs, pen, and pads were all complimentary items from medical dispensers Crestor and Zeneca. The dishes were all mash up of mismatched dishware you see at your grandmas.3) We had a Safeway bag used as a trash bag in our bathroom and the towel rack in the bathroom was ripped out. Later, we found it under the sink.4) The general state of repair of the motel was bad, items were well used, trash and lots of dust was found under the beds. It was homey for sure, but not a nice place to stay at for a nice vacation. We will add pictures to show this. Overall, I’ve stayed at nicer motels than this “hotel.” This is what I would’ve expected if I were staying at a hostel.","Cerritos, California","chinvicky</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cerritos, California</strong>",32,1.0

That is what we expected for the rate we got (about $60 a night), which didn't seem too low when it was booked as a package with flight, car and activities, in the off season, through Expedia.We walked in and there was just one thing after another: the lobby (if you can call a hallway with a dirty office and a coke machine a lobby) smelled like mold, or urine, I'm not sure. Then we were asked to pay $50 for the week to park in the hotel's bizzare, cramped parking garage that had no access to the building, you had to get all your bags up a 45+ degree incline, outside, around the building then up another steep flight of stairs, then up to your room, and don't hold your breath waiting for any sort of ""staff"" to help. THEN we were asked to pay another $150 ""deposite"" on the room. At every hotel I have every stayed in, here and abroad, I have been asked to provide a credit card number for them to keep, which would be charged with any expenses incurred on the last day when you checked out. This place has no room service, mini-bar, nothing that you could even incur an expense with, and it was pre-paid, so if they demand $150, up front, to just check into a room you have already paid for, you can imagine what kind of ""clientel"" they usually deal with. So, without our bags, we decide to go up to the room and just see, hoping it was better than the lobby, after all, their website said they had been recently renovated and showed nice pcitures. That is not an understatement, or even a misrepresentation, that is a %100 LIE. The only thing associalted with our room that appeared less than 20 years old was the key card device on the door. The living room had a weird bed (with no pillow) in one corner, the appliances were so old I could not have even turned on the stove if I had tried, and every piece of furniture appeared to be garage sale furniture form the 1980s, nothign matching in any way. And it smelled like the lobby. $150 deposite? For what exactly? Everythign in that entire room might have got $50 on Craigslist.But, asthetics aside, it was FILTHY. If you took the key card and scraped it down the arm of the couch it would remove thick black grime, undoubtedly the result of years of people with sunscreen rubbing elbows on it and no one ever cleaning it. The table was sticky, and even though we had been traveling for 18 hours and were exhausted, we couldnt bring ourselves to sit anywhere. We left immediatly, demanded, and got, a full refund for the ""deposite"" and parking fee. However, the hotel would only agree to refund 3 of the 5 nights we had reserved there. That is why I give the ""service"" a terrible rating as well, not only did they lie about their rooms, and show a picture of a room that was NOTHING like the rooms they had rented out, but they then tried to profit from those lies, even though we stayed less than 10 minutes in that room, never touched a thing, and never even brought our bags in. It was a SCAM, the guy behind the counter didnt even seem surprised that we wanted to check out. We finally got the remaining 2 nights refunded by Expedia, but only after 3 days of trying and 6 phone calls. We walked down the street until we found a place that looked decent- the Ilima Hotel. Great staff, professional environment, comfortable, clean and asthetically pleasing rooms, although we ended up paying twice as much because we were walking in off the street, but anything was worth not having to spend another moment in the ""Holiday Surf"".",Oklahoma,"Txjulies</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oklahoma</strong>",12,1.0

Because my room had a full kitchenette, I was able to save money by cooking in the room rather than going out every single night (although there are hundreds of great restaurants in the area if you prefer going out to eat). The view of the Ala Wai Canal and Downtown Honolulu city lights from the balcony was amazing, and was probably one of the best view possible without the ocean. Finally, the shower head had amazing water pressure.
