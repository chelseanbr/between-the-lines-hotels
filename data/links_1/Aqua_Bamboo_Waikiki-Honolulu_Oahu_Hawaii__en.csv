They need to take that off their site because I didn't hear a sound! Wasn't feeling well the last day and had a late departure and Aqua Bamboo offered to let me check out at 6 pm for a small fee. I wanted to get some sun so I turned down their offer. About 2 hours later I came back because still not feeling well and they had already cleaned my room but STILL let me stay until my flight.

The room itself is quite small with what appear to be very old and dingy decorations. I knew the bed was going to be bad, but was even more surprised to find that the walls were so thin you could hear the elevator every time it dinged on the floor as well as any time someone was speaking in the hallway or closing their door. The construction two blocks away began very early in the morning and continued until late at night adding more noise to an already impossible to sleep situation. The cherry on top were the drapes that were entirely too thin to block out the sunrise. We got about 2 hours of poor sleep and checked out in the morning. However, the hotel refused to refund us for the two nights we didn't even stay on the property. Worst hotel experience I have had in twenty years.",,101brittaj,4,1.0

While the courtyard is lovely and features teak furniture and red cushions, the hot tub was hugely dissapointing as was rarely hot. The staff was unable to figure out how to turn it on. Out of seven days only two days was actually hot. bar does not serve alcohol, friendly staff there though and small menu tasty. The hotel is regrettably much more ghetto than I had expected in reading reviews. I thought would be a little tarnished but not prepared for the trashed hallways and elevator. HUGE disparity in rooms, so beware. renovations not nearly done. 7 th floors up are renovated. learned the hard way that you do not want courtyard views, massive construction going on around hotel and on upper floor, courtyard side you will be exposed to loud earthmovers, not a Hawaiin view. Also we were inconvenienced by having water turned off one day, and workers coming in rooms. No coffee cups to use the coffee machine, no cream etc. the thursday reception was a joke, not poolside and the lei making was limited to two persons allowed to do at a time. VEry disappointing and NOT festive.Also the lower floor courtyard sanctuary view rooms are not refurbished and in bad repair. opt for mountain view room if possible. Disappointed in the luxury suite on 9th floor, There is orange construction webbing and green rope holding tiki hut together, trash dump site at back entrance.

I should have realized this hotel was not up to par when, upon arriving at 11 pm, several locals were working on a car right out front. Then we enter the lobby and hear an employee asking the front desk man what the various room charges are! Huh?! This was probably once a very nice place to stay. Unfortunately, the lack of upkeep shows. The only reason I gave it two stars was because the employees were very nice. Pros: nice employees; centrally located; safe in closet; large room; lemon water in lobby; big fridge and stove in kitchen area of our room.Cons: very loud a/c; bathroom window slats couldn't close so it got very warm in there; no ""continental"" breakfast; coffee machine out of order with only black coffee being free (cream was $1.00); three other entry doors to our room with cheap push in door locks-did not feel safe and told desk clerk; flimsy sliding door locks; kitchen drain plug broken; pool tiles were slimy and I slipped twice upon entry.

The room was a one bedroom suite with a queen bed in the bedroom and a queen pullout in the living area. Perfect sleeping arrangements for me and my family. We had a kitchen and were able to take full advantage of this during our stay. Coming from Canada, the CDN dollar doesn't fair well in the USA so this was very welcomed to save us a little $$$ and we took full advantage of this amenity.The hotel staff were extremely accommodating to any and all of our requests.The swimming pool is an incredible little oasis right in the middle of busy Waikiki! You'd never know you were in the middle of a city. We enjoyed the pool daily as there was always nice shaded areas to give the kids a break from the sun. Once the pool-side bar construction is complete, this will only add to the value of this area of the hotel.Pleasant surprise amenities:- Espresso machine in the lobby. Free cafe americano which we had every day and only $1.00 for specialty coffees like latte and $1.00 hot chocolate.- Complimentary beach chairs, float devices, body boards available to guests to take down to the beach.- Complimentary beach towel service- Movie rental machine in lobby, free of charge and included video games as there was a PlayStation in the room. This came in handy on the one and only day we had rain pretty much all day. Movies were nice to have at night when our day had wrapped up.- Washer/Dryers located on floors 4, 8 and 12 (from memory).The biggest PLUS with this hotel is the location. 1.5 blocks to the beach!! we were there in about 4 mins every day and it is so central we weren't far from whatever amenities we needed. We had rented a car for the week to explore the island but aside from that there was no need for a car. Next time we will skip that expense now that we know the hotel is so close to all we need.We would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone, it suits all types of travelers.",,Cliff K,1,5.0

There was some general maintenance and renovating going on in the hotel but it was all done as quietly and without disturbing you as much as possible.

I felt this was very good customer service and solved the issue of being in a room and uncomfortable. I moved my luggage to my new room which was on the opposite side so both balconies now looked at the mountains.The daily resort fee I feel is high especially if you do not use the dvd/games.

Unfortunately the pool was closed for refurbishing when we went but we did sneak a peek and it is a beautiful setting. The rooms and the hotel interior is very dated, like many of the hotels in Waikiki. The rooms, elevator and lobby are small. Many of the rooms look out onto the busy street or an alley with a brick wall. Ask for a pool view. Location is fantastic for quick and easy access to the bus ( right outside the door) or the beach ( a very easy 5 minute walk). You are about a block and 1/2 from the international market which is pricey but a nice place to walk around. There is a car rental agency within a 3 minute walk of the hotel but no parking on site. We realized that parking for rental cars is almost more than the daily rental. Often 20 to 30 dollars for over night. close Restaurants are mostly local Hawaiian plate or asian food. Burger King and McDonalds are a few minutes walk away for those who want a quick cheap meal. This hotel is for the budget minded who want a nice pool retreat when not at the beach.

They didnt give us fresh towels or replenish toiletries. Just made the bed and took out trash. No breakfast, the pool was under construction while I was there, not enough washers and dryers, also the washers and dryers are old and coin operated ones and I'm not sure how ""clean"" they really made my clothes. All in all it's a great spot for the price in the center of Waikiki/Honolulu. I was comfortable in my room and enjoyed my stay. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Keeping in mind this is by no means a 5 star hotel I would still recommend it as a place to stay if you want to be close to Waikiki beach. A few suggestions I have are updating the air conditioning to central air or something, the overall smell of the building was musty and they try off setting it with ALOT of what smells like off brand fabreez but that's just in the lobby area and elevators not I the actual rooms.

We actually did until they tried to kick us out because their reservation system was awry and we had to prove we actually reserved for the fourth night -- and the desk guy said, ""OK, you can stay."" Um, WHAT?Better stuff first. We're kama'aina and their discount was very generous. The location is superb for the price. The hotel has charm, there's a nice little concierge desk, and the amenities are just right for a moderate hotel. Most interactions with the front desk were pleasant (especially Moana -- really nice guy). The hotel is clean, and I liked the decor and comfortable vibe. The pool is nicest of all.So. The reservation system is seriously messed up, and the customer service unforgiveable. The first day we were there, we were settling in and I got a cancellation notice on my email. ""Your reservation has been cancelled."" Obvs we didn't do that, and a call to the front desk straightened that out. So onward to our third day, and we were relaxing in the room when housekeeping let themselves in. ""Are you extending your stay?"" she asked, surprised to see us. ""Uh, yes,"" we said. Meaning, yes, we reserved for a fourth night. (When I originally reserved, we reserved for three, and I called to add an additional night. My emails reflect it, and my last res email plainly stated four nights. Perhaps this is what wonked out the system. Why, I've no idea.)A few minutes later, I'm on the phone with a ghost tour agency trying to book us something to do that evening, and my husband answers the room phone. He hangs up in dismay, I hang up with the tour guy, my husband says, ""We have to leave."" Apparently the front desk has told us we have to get out.We start madly packing and I'm like, wait, let me find the ressie on my email. My husband calls the front deks back and says we have the email stating we're on for a fourth night. Front desk says he needs to see the email. (Here the onus is on us to prove our ""right"" to stay."" The entire exchange with this guy went this way.) Meanwhile, I call and guy says we won't be charged for the fourth night if we're out in about 30 minutes. Apparently the hotel is full, there's no alternative. Someone else has booked our room.Finally I'm incensed and I go down with my husband, and the front desk guy (this is Saturday 6/8 around 1:30 p.m.) has reviewed the email and just keeps saying, ""My notes had nothing about your staying a fourth night."" OK, well, I'm sorry you had inadequate ""notes,"" but this is your excuse and how you rep your hotel in a major snafu? He kept repeating why he was correct in thinking we'd no right to stay. THIS is what upsets customers. You can make even a major mistake, and if you own the problem and try to straighten it out, the guests are less likely to be angry. We're down there with all our bags, finally, not WANTING to stay (and expecting a chain of emails like the very first one on our first day saying we had to get out) and the guy just once again said, ""I said you could stay.""Yeah, right. I demand he print out the details of our stay so he doesn't overcharge us, quiz him on who he is and who is his manager (oh, and over and over he stated no one in the entire Aqua chain in management works weekends, so there's no one else we can call at the time.) No attempt to rebook us in another of the large number of Aqua hotels, which is what I'd have done. It was a big weekend at Waikiki, Pan Pacific fest, and Waikiki was largely booked. It wouldn't have been easy to waltz into another hotel and get a room. Believe me, I'd have headed straight for the Surfrider.We go outside, hail a cab, go to the airport, get on the next flight to Big Island where we live, pay $200 extra for the switch, and are really, REALLY glad to be home. So here is our experience with the Aqua Bamboo. We'll never stay there again.

The first night we were there it was too late to have the sheets changed after I discovered the stains and the state of the pillows. To avoid using the towels I wiped myself with a face washer. At least that was white. After a complaint to reception the linen and towels were changed but there was little improvement. I was asked how my stay was at checkout and mentioned the towels were disgusting. I was refunded one night’s resort fee.

Additionally, if you want more time in your room if you have a night flight from Honolulu, you would be wise to pay for that night because check-out time is 12.00 pm midday. This latter option gives you more hours to rest, bath, pack, have a drink, go out, etc before you leave the room.The comments which we have made in previous reviews remain and, as far as we are concerned, the only Hotel to stay at when you are in Waikiki from a security, safety, serenity, close proximity to Waikiki beach, very helpful and respectful staff, etc is the Aqua Bamboo Waikiki.Happy holidays and we hope that this review is helpful.Mahalo fromJanet and Richard",Auckland,"Richard L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland</strong>",55,5.0

The staff was pleasant and professional from the beginning to the end of our stay. We were on our honeymoon, so we were telling everyone and anyone that would listen including the staff. I think they heard us because our room was very nice. (Perhaps that's all their rooms) It had a full kitchen, 3 balconies and a huge king size bed. Also, awaiting us was complimentary champagne and chocolates! The only downside was the balcony that was off the kitchen opened to a building that was undergoing construction, so sitting out there was not the best idea, not the hotels fault. Just had to use our other two balconies. We were on the 8th floor facing the beach which I believe is 3 blocks away. This means the view was mainly other hotels with a sliver of beach in the distance. However, it was still nice because of the palm trees and the sounds of the ocean. If you want a view of the ocean you will have to go up to the top floors. You get complimentary towels and beach chairs. Now parking is not included as is the norm in Waikiki, but the valet car service is complimentary! I am not one to usually use this but was trying to maximize the relation vibe on my honeymoon. They have a pool and a hot tub that looked very nice from our room but we went to the beach and other spots the whole time. Pros:1: Location is right downtown. 3 Blocks from the beach and 3 blocks from the heart of Waikiki shopping and eating district. 2: Complimentary towels, beach chairs and valet parking service3: Free wifi (a lot of places charge extra)Cons: 1: Parking Not included (very common in Hawaii)2: No Room Service 3: Limited On Site Restaurant","Brooklyn, New York","Jacob S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",9,5.0

It was fairly shabby and drab. With very little expense, the room could be made to be much brighter and fresh. New towels and bed linen, fresher curtains, and a little more attention to the cleanliness overall. (Light switch panels were dirty, towels discolored, curtains left hanging off the hooks, unpolished bedhead and fridge door etc). A full length mirror would have been desirable, and a torch or light near the safe would help distinguish the numbers, which were in a dark area of the cupboard. On the upside, being a lone female traveler, I felt perfectly safe, the pool area was pleasant, tea,coffee and iced water were available at all times in the foyer and the staff were very pleasant and helpful. An ice machine was available in the pool area, and the cutlery/crockery and microwave in the room were a bonus The location was perfect, being close to the main beach area, shopping and eating establishments. The amenity fee is not something which Australian travelers are used to. However, in this instance it included wi fi, coffee in room, shuttle bus to a major shopping centre and use of beach towels. Considering I didn't make use of neither the shuffle service or beach towels, the fee was on the high side, but it is not negotiable, therefore, something to keep in mind when looking at room tariffs.

We were taken to our hotel ""Aqua Bamboo"" a boutique hotel, which we then were told they did not have our reservation which was made and paid for 8 months prior. To much distress from what we just went through I was still shaken & lost it all over again with this news from hotel guest services, Fe was helping us and was very sympathetic to our experience we just went through, after many attempts to resolve our issue, she called hotel manager Kimari who was as puzzled as the rest of us, she made some calls to get to the bottom of it, with not much explanation to her of why they didn't ever receive our reservation from the 3rd party Kimari offered & put us in their top level 3 room suite. Complete with kitchenette, bedroom & sitting/bar area with large outdoor patio with bbq, high top table, lighted hut with couch's & chairs & view of lighted city. After getting to our suite, we shortly had a knock at the door & to our surprise they brought us a bottle of Chandon Brut & a box of chocolate macadamia nuts, which we thoroughly enjoyed. We were so very thankful for Kimari & Fe for their concern, generosity.

However, the good reviews did not match what I had witnessed. Although our room has renovated kitchenette, there were just too many bulky furniture in such a small space which made it challenging to find a place for the “dining” table for us to eat comfortably. Neighboring hotel balcony has a view of our bathroom window that they could see you shower. I wish the management repaints the walls in white to give the illusion that rooms &lobby are bigger than they appear & get rid of the unnecessary furniture. There were also chipped paints on the wall, noisy AC box & you could hear the heavy traffic from the street. Since there’s kitchenette, better to remove the room carpet for a cleaner look & easier maintenance, have one type of flooring throughout the rooms & replace sliding doors with double pane, old tub & fixtures. The good thing about this hotel is its prime location, just parallel with Kalakaua & 2 blocks to Waikiki Beach. It is situated on a busier road due to public transportations traveling on this street. But, this place is a walking distance to many restaurants, shopping areas, & definitely easy access to bus rides/stops. The main highlight of this hotel is its private pool (I think the jacuzzi had been renovated). There is a veggie Pizza place onsite which I was not able to try. This hotel is old but rich in history. If management only gives it more care & love, this place can be more in demand because it has a nice private pool with paradise ambience, & friendly & helpful staff. Guests: Don’t forget to try the shave ice at Vintage Island Shave Ice (outside Royal Hawaiian Shopping Mall) & check out Longs Store on Kalakaua, & Whalers on Kuhio as sometimes they have more items for those on a budget. ;) Mahalo nui loa for reading this review.

There was a glimpse of Waikiki beach and almost a glimpse of Diamond head. Other than that it was a view of other balconis forward of the hotel. The balcony was nice but the furniture(chairs) were little heavy to the surroundings. Little smaller chairs would be more practical maybe away to be folded if you want more space on the balcony. We had rented a car for two days (that makes a 1 night) parking fee is 30$/night.The room was ok, bathroom tap was dirty and the water didn't come out of it properly. Seemed like calcium from the water. Other than that the cleanliness was good. There was a coffee maker in the room and fridge. Safe was in the room too and free of charge which was handy.The hotel has a swimming pool and jaquzzi.

He was like ok ok so two nights. Than hub again no two day(between two days there is only one night).

Nice to have a kitchen for making breakfast. Cons: underground parking lot is very small and hard to maneuver a large vehicle like a minivan. Rooms have window air conditioners which are loud but it helps with the street noise. Rooms are not soundproof and it's common to hear garbage trucks, emergency vehicle sirens, etc. throughout the night. Rooms and hallways are tired and could use some tlc.

No fan in the bathroom...just an open window with horizontal metal shutters. Tip: Reserve your parking spot before you arrive as there are only about 9 spots and ideally, your vehicle would be smaller than a minivan.

My room smelled musty, but I remedied that by turning off the air conditioning and leaving the windows open. The pool area was an inviting place to hang and many of us chose to sit there rather than in our rooms. The hotel had a pau hana happy hour one of the days during our stay.

The lobby is very cute and they provide lemon water, tea and coffee for every guest in the hotel at no charge. The front desk employees are very nice and helpful. They also provided beach equipment's such as beach towels, beach chairs, floaters, etc which was a nice touch because the beach is very close walking distance, and walking distance to two ABC stores, and numerous other food places around the hotel. The pizza place called The Lovin Oven which is located in the hotel is very very delicious and would totally recommend it. My room was located on the street side, which made it very noisy during my stay and to make it worse their AC is tremendously loud as well. Makes it hard to sleep peacefully at night.My main complain is the cleanliness of the rooms, which i take very seriously, and supposedly the hotel does too. I stood on the 8th floor and the housekeeper did not do a good job at all cleaning both rooms in which i had stood in. There was so much dust on every desk and counter, and obviously showed that it had not been cleaned properly or at all. ( as seen my pictures).During my stay i had dropped some tea on my sheets and went ahead to clean it so it doesn't stain, and brought the sheet off my bed once it dried and placed it on the floor, so i can receive a new set of sheet the next morning. To my surprise, the housekeeper put the SAME sheet that was on the FLOOR! Back on my bed again. That is utterly disgusting!! She didn't even bother to properly fix the sheets on the bed as seen in the pictures i provided. I also had placed a robe that they provided on the floor, so it can be washed and she just left it there, which made me question if these robes are even washed continuously during ones stay. The bathroom, wasn't even swept. I had my doubts that the housekeeper wasn't doing her job properly so i went ahead and left a cap to the lotion on the floor to see if she would actually pick it up or sweep. Which, she did neither ( as you can tell in my picture). The bath tub wasn't cleaned, nor the walls of the tub, and left with hair around it. By the end of my stay, due to the fact that rooms are not cleaned properly, i had a huge COCKROACH come to my room. YES, a roach! I understand that Hawaii has numerous roaches, but to have your hotel room have one isn't right to me, it should be properly cleaned, sanitized, and some form of pest control.I hope that management retrains their housekeeping section and takes it more seriously, because the rest of the hotel is very pleasant.","Los Angeles, California","sorayamortez</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",0,3.0

First things first, we call the hotel that morning(4/20/17) to make a reservation for that night, checking out on 4/21/17. It was a one night stay, thankfully, as we were traveling around the whole island. We get to the hotel to check in around 8:30pm, and we are told they can't find our reservation. After a few different people looking and a few phone calls, turns out they had made our reservation for the 21st, to check out on the 22nd. Strike one. I should have taken this as a sign to go find another hotel, but my wife and I were exhausted from a full day of travel and just wanted to sleep. The front staff was very rude to my wife and I, telling us the mistake was our fault (said I told them the wrong dates, but how could I have been at fault for saying ""we need a room for tonight, only"") Then, the price we were quoted in the morning for a room wasn't even close to the same price we were given when we got there, but nobody bothered to mention that I went from paying $115 give or take to almost $200, plus they charged extra fees, and the valet price was outrageous, considering they wouldn't let us park the car ourselves. The guy doing the valet seemed completely displeased when we asked if our bags could be taken up to our room (Yes, they were 35 lb bags, but there were only two, and I had already pulled them out of the car and placed them on the cart), and took his sweet time doing it. Strike two and then some. Now, I feel the need to say that this hotel is SEVERELY outdated. The whole place looked like I stepped out of a time machine into the 1960's. While on Kauai, before coming to Oahu, we stayed in two other Aqua owned hotels, and they were magnificent, so I was extremely hopeful, based on pictures I had looked at, that this one would be just as amazing, and I was oh so wrong. The front counter woman continued to be rude when I asked her basic questions, like how late is the pool open, what kind of bed is in the room, etc.When the contract was presented to me, I noticed the huge price increase, and inquired about it, as it wasn't as before. I was told that the rates change (which I know and believed) but that also the room that they mistakenly put us in wasn't as nice as the one we were going to be in that nice, and I was also told it was a pool view room. Okay, that's fine, I'll pay the extra for the nicer room and nicer view, I just wanted to be in bed! Here's the kicker, our ""pool view room"" was on the second floor, and when I opened the curtains, there was no pool in sight. So, thanks for the lie! Instead I got to look at the hotel or condos being built directly next door, which workers started coming to and building at about 6:30am the next morning. Not that we got that great of sleep anyway!In addition to being lied to about our view, our room was horrendous. There was a window unit next to the sliding doors that was the loudest thing I've ever heard in my life. We had to choose between AC or the television because we couldn't hear the TV of the window unit was on! Also, there were surge protectors plugged into other surge protectors, and wires all over the floor, and even near the window unit, which leaked and left a wet spot on the floor and made an awful smell! We had to move the wires and surge protectors away from it so they wouldn't get wet! The window unit itself didn't even have glass next to it, to continue the window, (the window unit itself was practically sitting on the floor anyway) it instead had plywood sealing off the hole, and the ply wood was put in so poorly that it made the window unit work even harder due to holes leading outside! First impression wasn't great. The tv reception was spotty, so we ended up renting a DVD from their kiosk downstairs (probably the only good thing about this place is the free DVD rentals) to watch before bed. The room has a Playstation 3 on it to play the DVD's, which is great, except ours didn't seem to want to play Blu-ray Discs, which is what 95% of those DVD's were. Awesome. Called the front desk about it, they said they would send someone up in a few to replace or fix the PS3, and no one ever came. Great. We resorted to the good old laptop and Netflix. This room had a little kitchenette in it, which was nice, except all of the cups and dinnerware we were provided were dirty, and the fridge still had someone else's drinks and leftovers in it. Needless to say we left the kitchenette alone and ordered pizza instead. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, I go to use the restroom, and the toilet wouldn't flush. I took the top off the tank and there was NO water in it! So I called again and we were told that the water may be off, and to turn it on by twisting the knob under the toilet, or to refill the tank ourselves. Excuse me?? We should have been offered another room on that alone. I tried turning the knob under the toilet to turn the water on, and I turned it every which way possible and the tank never refilled. I ended up using the trash can in the bathroom to refill it just so I could flush. I called once again and said that no matter what way i turned the knob, the water never came back on. Again I was told someone would look into it, and no one ever showed. If it wouldn't have been after midnight by this point, I would have packed everything back up and left, but we were dog tired, and I left everything up for the morning, where I planned on telling the next shift of people what happened, hoping to at least get an apology for the lies we were fed and the terrible state of that room. We got up the next morning, I went to make a cup of coffee, and there were two roaches in the sink. At that point, I was livid. I woke my wife up and showed her, we took pictures of everything, packed our things and went to check out. I didn't want to spend another second in that room. We packed our stuff, called down to have our bags brought down and our car brought around so we could check out. We waited about 15 minutes and no one showed, so we ended up taking the bags down ourselves. Whatever. We go to check out, and I explain to the woman ""helping"" me what happened the night before, our complaints, and how uncomfortable our entire stay was there. Her ""apology"" was ""Sorry the room wasn't up to your standards, but we hope you'll stay with us again!"" Why on earth would I stay here ever again? I showed her the pictures, told her about maintenance not showing up twice, the bugs, everything, and I was more than polite considering how unhappy I was with everything. They proudly display plaques behind the counter of their ratings and awards but I honestly have no idea how they earned those. I asked for phone numbers to contact someone higher up to share my complaints with, and was given two non working phone numbers. I went online looking and called, got placed on hold and subsequently hung up on twice. I feel like we should have been, at the VERY least, offered a new room or something for what we went through, but not one person working there seemed to care. I'm still working to get in contact with someone who will take me seriously, and I really want some sort of compensation or full refund for all of this. Completely unprofessional, extremely outdated, and not worth the $200+ we got suckered out of. I hope Aqua drops this hotel, because it is really putting a hurt on their image. They say you get what you pay for but I stayed in hostels on three different island during my trip that were nicer, cleaner, and more accommodating than this hotel, and hostels are less than $40 a night! I hope someone sees this, because the way that hotel is run, the rude staff they employ, and the condition of the room (probably rooms), is NOT okay for a so called ""one of the best hotels in Waikiki"". I've stayed at Motel 8's in the middle of nowhere that were nicer. They should advertise as a 1 or 2 star hotel with a 60-80 dollar price tag, at least then I would have known and expected it to be as bad as it was. Again, luckily it was only for one night, but this trip was for my wife and I's first wedding anniversary. Thank god we were traveling around so much and island hopping, because I don't think I would have been able to stay more than one night in that place, even if we had moved rooms, because based on other reviews, the problems we had seem to be consistent problems other people are having. Way to put a damper on our anniversary. For that price we could have stayed somewhere on the beach, with a working toilet, no bugs, and a quiet AC. Really hope this hotel gets a makeover and either a better trained or completely new staff. It's in a prime location and has potential to be great, but a lot of work needs to be done!

The main doors to Aqua Bamboo lock at around 10.00pm each night and do not unlock until around 6.30am each morning. Guests or people wishing to visit therefore must have a working Hotel access card which they must swipe outside the main doors to get in. There is a night front desk staff member as well as a night security guard outside the main doors guests.Being only a 5 minute short walk from Waikiki beach, the Aqua Bamboo Waikiki could not be in a better position. You are off the main drag and busyness of Kalakuaua Avenue and this, we have found, to be more appealing and cheaper than staying in some of the 5 star Hotels on Waikiki Beach such as the Moana Surfrider, Royal Hawaiian Hotel, etc.There is a well stocked ABC shop one street corner away which opens at 6.30am every morning, so visitors do not have to pay more say at The Pantry which is further down Kuhio Avenue and more crowded to shop in.The Bus is still only USD 2.50 per person and, depending upon the length of your excursion for the day, you can ask the driver for a Transfer ticket (usually they hand these out automatically) which last approximately 2 hours. This means that you can say go by bus to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and back within 2 hours or so (the bus drivers are usually fairly lenient on accepting beyond the 2 hours same day transfer ticket) for USD 5.00 per person - even around the island within the 2 or so hours grace period. You can also walk - takes a leisurely 30 minutes to Ala Moana Shopping Center - if you choose, as we often do providing it is not too hot.In terms of dining and recreational facilities close to Aqua Bamboo Waikiki, there are a wide variety of things to do so you will never be bored in this beautiful God-given paradise that is Hawaii.The front desk staff at Aqua Bamboo Waikiki go out of their way to ensure a very happy and safe stay for every guest. We would particularly like to mention and thank Lokahi, Zenie, Fe and Aja who are such polite, friendly and helpful staff. Aqua Bamboo Waikiki Management and guests alike are very lucky to have them. The housekeeping staff, as on our many return visits to Aqua Bamboo Waikiki, are excellent ensuring that each room is cleaned thoroughly and bathroom supplies are replenished.There is even a special 'Bamboozle' evening put on by Aqua Bamboo Waikiki staff, every Thursday afternoon from 4.30pm to around 6.00pm. This is a great way of meeting fellow guests by the pool/spa whilst enjoying a Hawaiian cocktail, some food and entertainment from a local artist.In terms of room requests, we recommend rooms above Level 5 (more peaceful) with an 01 at the end of the 3 digit room number. These rooms usually have ocean and hotels views, and have generous sized decks for reading, soaking up the sun /views, etc. For those visitors who want lighter rooms with better mirrors, request a room ending in a 10 above Level 5 (e.g. 710).Thank you, Mahalo and Aloha until we return again to the beautiful Aqua Bamboo Waikiki Hotel.Janet and Richard",Auckland,"Richard L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland</strong>",55,5.0

Been there 4 times so that says something if I keep coming back. I like the location- 2 blocks from the beach and around the corner from some good restaurants. They have a nice pool and hot tub, valet parking, and a few other basic amenities. I recently stayed there and by calling the hotel directly, we got an upgraded suite for the price of a basic room. Stayed on the 9th floor and had a huge patio with grill to ourselves, 2 mini fridges, a microwave and a stove. So, call reservations directly as opposed to going on those so called price slashing sites. This is a noisy place though and I have stayed on 4 different floors. You are on a busy street with bus traffic and garbage trucks loud enough to wake my toddler even all the way up to the higher floors. So if you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs! Hawaii is expensive and even some of the cheaper hotels have a lot of tax. This place included with a daily hospitality fee of 18.00 and a ""transient accommodation fee"" of 20.00. Whether you use valet or park yourself at the garage next door, it's 25.00 a night. So, expect to spend at least 50.00 more a day than just the room fee. All in all, for 10 days, using daily valet, we paid close to 3,000 dollars for our stay. I don't remember it being that expensive any of the other trips, so we may have to start saving sooner or figure something out for next time.I would stay here again though ....","Oceanside, California","EMB1760</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oceanside, California</strong>",5,4.0

My wife returned to our room to hear rustling of shopping bags in the main bedroom, she thought someone had broken in to our room. My wife went into the bedroom and was confronted by bellman ""Raymond"", he was standing near an open wardrobe where all our shopping bags were and the in room safe. Raymond made some poor excuse about washing on the balcony, and he was dropping off our departure gift (we still had 2 days before checkout). My wife told him we were not checking out and he should check his list, Raymond then said "" I better wear my glasses next time"" and left. My wife checked our belongings went and checked on the children, and then reported the incident to the front desk. They said that they will report this to the manager and she will be in contact. The next day my wife was asked by the front desk staff to write a statement of what occurred which she did straight away. The only correspondance we have received to date is an email from the area general manager, Kahealani Colon, the day after we had left Hawaii, saying that she agrees that this incident needed investigating and he would be in touch ina few days to advise the outcome of their investigations.

The beds were very comfortable and we enjoyed the robes and our view from the balcony as these amenities helped with relaxation. As a part of my reservation I received a delicious complimentary scone from a quaint little muffin shop next to the hotel. There were also several little stores and shops right next to the hotel that were very convenient. The pool area was very pretty and the lobby was nice and clean.

The rooms were decent, I do not have many complaints about them, however, they really screwed me over when they damaged my rental car during the stay. Upon checking out, valet the rear bumper on our rental car but did not tell us. Since the valet loaded our bags we did not see the dent until we got to the airport. The rental agency charged us for the damage, and even though I filed a claim with the Aqua Bamboo they denied it because we didn’t report the damage on site. They have sleazy kids working the valet, beware. Emails to customer service regarding the valet damage fell of deaf ears.That wasn’t the only issue. The hot tub was broken the entire time we were there. A lot of time there was no one at the front desk when we went down to get towels or speak to someone. They charge an $18 “resort fee” for no reason, it’s a hotel with a pool, that doesn’t even have a working hot tub. AVOID. Much better options in Waikiki.",,Troy M,3,1.0

I had asked my travel agent to request a higher floor since there was supposed to be some construction going on. The front desk fellow, who was definitely gruff, said that my travel agent didn't make the request and that there were no other rooms available anyway. So we took the key. Slept and got up in the morning to go out onto our balcony which was totally screened by bamboo. Honestly, we couldn't see anything. All we heard was the noise of construction from the building being renovated which was right across from us. No natural light was coming into the room and we had to have lights on. Had a busy day that day and following day. Our next day was a free one and my husband and I decided we didn't want to stay there any longer unless we had a room change. I had NEVER asked for a change of room in a hotel before but I was determined on this request (demand). I was very polite and when I explained the problem to the front desk, the gentleman was very accommodating about changing our room. We were only moved up 2 floors -- actually was just above the building being renovated -- but we saw palm trees, sunshine and other hotels... We were just thrilled with the room change and used the balcony quite often during our stay. We could even talk to one another since we were above the construction.Otherwise, our stay was great. Room was clean and comfortable bed and we had kitchen facilities. Grocery store was just a few minutes away. All the other staff that we dealt with at the hotel were fabulous.Pool was very nice. Location was great. Five minute walk to the beach and lots of shopping nearby -- food, souvenirs stores, restaurants...Upon departing, my husband and I said we would not hesitate to stay at that hotel again so I did end up giving it 4 Stars.

So if you want to sit by the pool forget it about it as this swimming area is useless as the hotel blocks all the sunshine that would hit the swimming area.This hotel is on Kuhio Avenue and not set back away from the street. You will hear the weekend traffic till 2:30 A.M. in the morning.Other hotels on Kuhio are set back further from the street and are larger. Meaning other hotels have quiet and loud sides depending on your preference.This hotel is too small to have that preference so it is always noisy !Better off staying at an Aston or Outrigger Hotel as these 2 chains have been in Hawaii longer and are much better hotels at the same costs.Read more reviews and check other hotel chains prices.

The wifi which could only be used has been sorted and you can now access wifi in everyroom of the hotel and pool area. Other than those, it felt like i was right back at home. We arrived super early into honolulu (6am) and the hotel had been booked out fully the day before we stayed. We were advised from the offset that the hotel could and would hold our luggage and that while they couldn't guarantee that they could organise any early check in for us, they told us to arrive back earlier than the time we would have been due to stay (check in at 3pm). They also gave us the opportunity to change clothing and get refreshed before we ventured out again. The rooms were well kept and whilst not the most modern, they were most definitely comfortable. The hotel had amenities that actually worked and it was properly maintained. The lobby area was clean and large enough to accommodate groups waiting to check in and out; the pool and adjoining jacuzzi are the stars of the courtyard and they make for a great and tranquil time. The hotel itself is less than a 5 minute walk away from the hustle bustle of Kalakaua Avenue where the beach and famous shopping strip is. it's the perfect location to just get away from the business of waikiki and to relax. The staff are super accommodating and are probably the most patient and customer focused you could ask for - from those who work in the Lobby to house keeping and maintenance.

A room, reserved two months in advance, is not available. But after a dramatic pause, a receptionist offers you a suite instead.Possibly more luxurious - I’ll take their word for it. But instead of the promised ocean view you get a spectacular overlook of a service area. And most importantly, instead of the promised full kitchen, there is only a tiny kitchenette in a nook. But at least we got a counter-top stove (used as a counter for the lack of space), and a fridge - no, two of them! Two tiny cold bars, tucked in different rooms and working like every cold bar in an economy-priced hotel.OK - room itself (because it is definitely a room, not a suite - a pull-off divider does not qualify as a door). Panoramic windows - oh yeah, but so fingerprinted, it makes me think of a conserved crime scene; but again, it is no stickier than the rest of the furniture, so it might be part of decor; speaking of which - fabulous three balconies! Unfortunately, only one opens (so if you want to air the room - forget it). But the access to that one (accidentally with the view of the service area) is blocked by a huge bed. So to get out, you need to go through the obstacle course. I am looking at it not as discrimination by fitness level, but a free gym included in the package. Naturally the bed closest to the only chance to step outside, is broken by those unfortunate ones who are not fit enough to jump its ample queen size, and bolted to the floor.All in all, we felt on a quest, making do with counterintuitive appliances and electric sockets always just a trifle out of reach. Determined not to let anything spoil our vacation, I compliment the designers and maintenance staff for making our stay so challenging and refreshing (except for the bed sheets, not changed once in 9 days).

We enjoyed our stay very much. I have read many of the reviews of this hotel and sometimes I feel you just can't please some people. They are going to find something to complain about and they expect everything to be perfect. We lived on the island for 3 years and the cost of living is expensive. I understand that this hotel doesn't want to waste lobby space or hall space when real estate is so high in Hawaii. To get an idea of how high it is, we lived in a 700 sq foot apartment and paid $1750 in rent. The hotel is priced just right I feel for being in the heart of the city close to so much and 2 blocks from the beach. Yes there is street noise but what do you expect being in the city. If you don't want the city noise than don't stay in the city. The air conditioner is a normal sounding window unit. It sounds like a large fan. I enjoyed the sound of it because I am use to sleeping with a fan and it drowned out the street noise at night. The thank you chocolates at the end of our stay were a nice touch. We enjoyed the atmosphere of the pool and the lobby. We enjoyed being able to walk to the beach and many shops and restaurants. We enjoyed the lemon water in the lobby. We enjoyed being able to do our laundry on site. We enjoyed being able to cook in our kitchenette. We enjoyed the staff. We enjoyed the smell of the lobby and elevators. Was everything perfect....no, but I understand life isn't. Did the staff do everything to make our stay as perfect as it could be...yes and for that we are grateful.

She was very apologetic, understanding and courteous in handling the matter. This new room was on the 10th floor. It was facing the pool, and we had some views of the ocean. More importantly, it was a big difference to the room we originally had. It was a lot more spacious, had a new air con, 2 balconies, no mildew smell nor damp carpets.

Aja was very helpful, so friendly and always remembered little things about our day that made us feel welcome. She is a star! There is a shuttle that runs between the aqua hotels which is quite good as it can drop you off at Ala Moana Centre for free but it takes quite long and only comes every half an hour to an hour! The best thing about this hotel is the location. Very central location within Waikiki beach, just a block or so away from the beach, that's what you are paying for as its not a fancy hotel. The rooms are quite outdated and could do with a revamp. The air conditioning was the loudest thing I have ever heard, we couldn't sleep with it on because it was so loud, during the day it was okay and necessary to have it on. We slept with the door open which then meant we had all the street noise which is quite significant but it's either that or the air con so it's not the most quietest of places. This might be pedantic but something that would have improved my stay was to have a more consistent room clean. Everyday the towels would be in different places or on different racks, nicely folded or just placed on the rack like normal. Some days we would have a bed full of fancy pillows and then some days they were gone. It would just be nicer to come back and it be the same everyday so you would know what to expect.

IF we hadnt hired a car and escaped Waikiki for one of the days we were staying I'm unsure if I would have coped. Waikiki is a very noisy congested commercial city and its no holiday. Get out of Waikiki if you can but then you see how the whole island of Oahu has been stripped of native vegetation to make way for cropping and development.

This is part of a small group of properties - all with the Aqua moniker...I really enjoyed the location: 2 blocks from the beach, close to several little shops and services and central to so many food and beverage options. The WiFi was good and free, there were complimentary apples in the lobby and daily newspapers. The staff were hit and miss. Aja was a STAR...as was the tall young man with the Hawaiian first name (apologies but I can't recall it) who checked me in early one morning (and did a darn fine job I might add). A few of the staff were clearly just there for the paycheck as they were more interested in their phones, chatting to each other and looking 'busy' which was a shame because staff like Aja made them look really lame given that she was always smiling, 'guest-orientated' & upbeat - like I say, a STAR! It would be nice for some of the staff here to be made aware of the importance of name recognition when dealing with guests and also that most of us have travelled extensively. While standing awkwardly waiting for an elevator, I personally really don't want to hear staff at front desk discussing how dead the afternoon shift can be and how they like it when it is busy for the first couple of hours as it makes the shift go by soooooo much quicker etc etc etc....that's lame. The room (1001 I think it was) was well appointed and I found the kitchenette & fridge fantastic for keeping drinks and treats cold. I loved being able to 'stock-up' at the ABC Store and keep everything in my room for lunch, snacks, etc....There were 3 balconies (!) & 1 of them was massive complete with loveseat, tables, chairs and ocean glimpses. I really was surprised as I thought the door led to a closet but nope, it was a massive, AWESOME little Lanai.....The Queen bed was a little soft but nothing too dramatic. Lot's of great pillows and linens - good towels and washroom amenities (shower gel/shampoo/conditioner/soap). The housekeeping staff were really kind and pleasant- they all did such a wonderful job of keeping this property looking great...The pool was clean and quiet. It doesn't get a ton of sunshine but that can be a good thing some days.I would stay here again, if for no other reason than the location, the safe/clean facilities and of course Aja's smile and presence.Thank you Aqua Bamboo.

We stayed in April 2016 for 12 nights. There were some major pitfalls of our stay here, as well as some highlights. Our fist impression was good, Lobby is beautifully renovated, however our room was not so great. Very dated, also we found things were not to the standard we would have expected, like our bath having rust holes and mould, also the cupboards sliders didn't slide, also the toaster was broken on the centre element, there was paint peeling and the air conditioner, although worked well, was extremely noisy, and the hot water was lukewarm at best on most days, and there were even times there was no hot water at all. They are in the process of renovating and it seems as they are going floor by floor, that would have been nice to know at time of booking, or have been informed of as our travel date got closer. Their pool area while small is very nice and a relaxing environment to be in, the spa is a little too hot I think. They were having issues with the fire alarm, and as such we were woken at least 7mornings at around 4-5am with what they called a ""glitch"" then our smoke detector randomly went off at 4am one morning, to which we had to call reception to have it turned off, these things did not make for happy guests. Upon leaving we had to pay our resort fee of $15 per night of stay, however that was waived for us, so that was something we appreciated, a considerable saving over our length of stay. The staff were nice and friendly and can only do so much with an old building. Would we stay here again? Probably not, not until it was fully renovated at least. ",,Dani G,0,3.0

Not just because the room itself is barely nicer than a 1970's roadside motel, but because everything about the information the hotel provides is misleading. We only had one night in Waikiki, so didn't want to break the bank with a luxury room, but did expect good, basic lodging. Website offers $116, actual rate when we arrived was $179 (""oh, those posted prices are just starting rates"", says the desk) PLUS a hospitality fee, PLUS an amenities fee, which they tout as an advantage for the guests. For the amenities fee of $15, you get Lemon water in the lobby. (YEA, lemon water in the lobby!!) A manager's reception on Thursdays- (Not there on a Thursday, and wouldn't give AF about the reception if I were.) I don't even remember what the other useless ""amenities"" were, outside of the use of a beach towel, which I didn't need.They offer onsite parking, which basically doesn't really exist. The garage next door is $25 a day, and the machine wasn't working and they were ticketing even hotel guests who had notes on their windshields offering to pay when possible. We were directed to a place blocks away which only took cash. A real pain in the a... Because of the misinformation we we given at the desk (see IQ of employees below) about the room rates and parking situation, it literally took us and hour an a half to get into our room. The room itself: size ok, bed comfortable, loud street noise, every surface of furniture dinged up and slightly shabby, kitchenette would be convenient if you needed one, (and brought your own knife that could cut something other than warm butter, and paper towels, and and and). Bathroom: sand in the tub, mold on the caulk, handle of hot water in tub came off in my hand when I turned it on (threads stripped, so no putting it back on), a weird oversized kitchen faucet on the bathroom sink. Low quality everything.Not to be unkind, but the guys at the desk were just plain dumb. Especially one of them, who was so bad as to have you waiting to make sure he wasn't kidding (he can not POSSibly be this slow, you are thinking- but you would be wrong). Overall, this was a very disappointing experience. Granted, it is not a luxury hotel, and one cannot expect this to be equivalent to a W. The location is not bad.

During this week I had two very different experiences. I arrived in Waikiki several days before before joined by a friend. Because I was on my own for the 1st half of my trip, I opted for a 1 bed suite with a kitchen, and a court yard view. They put me in room 710. I wouldn't call that a court yard view, when you are looking down 7 flights at the court yard. It is more of a city view, unless you lean over the railing to look straight down. Room 710 smelled bad. The carpet was horrible, the bathroom looked like it was from the 1970s, and the kitchen was no better. The room was dark, and the AC unit made a horrible noise when it was turned on. If it wasn't Thanks Giving week, I would of switched hotels.1/2 way through my trip I was joined by my friend, and we moved to room 903. This was night and day. This room was beautiful, with an amazing patio. It looked over the city, which was fine. but the rooms itself was spacious, clean, with an updated bathroom and slate flooring (no nasty smelly carpet). The kitchenette was small, but the amazing patio did more than make up for it. The staff was friendly enough. They don't have a restaurant, so I would go to the Sheridan around the corner for Breakfast, or we would go out. No big deal. The parking garage is tiny. But they do have an over flow lot at the hotel next door. I never tried the pool, but it looks a little small (then again, i was on the 7th floor looking straight down at it). I would stay again just to stay in room 903, but I think upon checking out they could of done more. When I was checking out, they asked me how my stay was, and I told them. I was 1/2 expecting that they would of offered some type of comp for the 1st part of my stay in that crappy room, but I was mistaken.","Atlanta, Georgia","116DanielG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",2,3.0

Better view, not so noisey and a much better room. Then we found the toilet was already blocked and took a long time to flush!

It had a very nice feel to it and all staff were so friendly and helpful.Firstly, we were located on 12th floor which at the moment is the top floor (I think!! Maybe the 3 floors above are being redone? They weren't accessible anyway!) and had a corner room with two balconys. This was perfect since it meant we could see the mountains as well as the ocean....and we so loved the view. Our room was compact for sure but it was very clean and well equipped. I think the only thing that was missing in the rooms was a kettle (for our cups of tea!!) but tea and coffee is complementary in the lobby so there's not really a need for a kettle I guess. The bed was really comfy and the blackout curtains were very welcome. I loved the pink orchid blossoms that were scattered throughout the room for us checking in...such a lovely touch. We were able to keep the room on until 6pm since we had a late pick up and later flight which was so helpful and we were able to do this for hardly anything (charge wise) A short walk from the beach and the area seems safe enough!! There is a lot of road noise but the air con mostly blocked this out as it is pretty loud. Neither of these things bothered us though as we needed the air con to keep us cool throughout the night and we chose to stay central so street noise is expected.

I've stayed at really high end hotels and at those near the other end in Honolulu. This was my second stay here. It reminds me of a comfortable pair of shoes that might be a little worn. The location is perfect - off the main strip but close to everything. There are nearby restaurants, convenience-type stores, even farmers markets where you can get some inexpensive, local food - all within a short walk. There is a small restaurant on-site near the pool. There are two car rental agencies around the corner - I found it cheaper to rent by the day and avoid paying for overnight parking. There is a concierge desk in the lobby to help you plan your stay. The lobby has a calming Asian decor - nice to come in from a busy day to serenity, ice water, iced tea, and coffee - all before you go to your room. Free daily newspapers are available in the lobby. The staff are welcoming, friendly, and very helpful. Free wi-fi throughout the hotel. My room had a safe that fit my laptop, camera, and lenses easily. I had a microwave, cooktop, refrigerator, and dish sink as well as dishes and pots and pans. I found it economical to get local 'plate lunches' that gave me at least 2 meals each and eat a 'splurge' meal once a day. The room was clean and my bed was comfy. The bathroom has a non-skid tub and grab bar and good water pressure. I really like the over-toilet cabinet for storage.

When we got to the hotel the receptionist was surprised we were three people. I showed her a copy of the comments I sent a few months ago. She said their hotel did not receive information from Expedia. Fair enough, however we still need a room with two double beds. It was apparent the hotel was not full. The receptionist tried to charge us $40.00 US per night extra. I stated that it did not seem fair as I had in good faith let the hotel know that we were 3 travelers. The receptionist then assigned us a room with two double beds that faced a tenement building next door. We were greeted with a view of balconies filled with junk such as old mattresses, old chairs stacked-up - you get the picture. The apartment building was maybe 20 feet from our balcony. We had a perfect view of all that was going on in the next building. The building had three floors. We were put on the third floor. The hotel has 9 floors.

Our balcony door in room 708 didn't shut or lock properly but we were on the 7th floor so it wasn't a problem. The a/c worked but dripped all over the dresser top, but it didn't affect us. Bed and pillows were comfortable, Close walk to multiple ABC stores.Favorite part about the hotel other than location (literally 2-3 blocks from the beach!) was that you can borrow a couple of the low-slung beach chairs for the day or evening and its really nice to have them on the beach wherever you set up camp. The pool/beach towels were in decent repair and did the job.Least favorite part- we were told in an email prior to arrival that parking was available but that it may be right next door at the sister property, which was not a problem as it was practically the same driveway. However, when we checked in (late check-in, which we also confirmed with the hotel prior via email) the garage next door was also full. So past midnight, after working a full day shift and then flying 6 hours to get there, we had to walk 3-4 blocks then back to park in a garage that was cash only, and the rest of our stay any time we wanted to park we were unable to get access to the garage next door as it was still full. Bonus is, I guess we got some extra exercise and saved a few bucks as it was ""only"" $20 at the other garage. Would have given our stay a 5 star review had we been able to park at least next door, we spent a lot of our trip walking to and from the garage when we only needed to stop and shower quickly before dinner, etc.Overall we were pretty pleased with our stay, and would for sure recommend it and stay again.","Seattle, Washington","GrammySmells</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",12,4.0

The property is showing signs of its age around the edges, and you can see signs of wear on the cabinets, door jambs, etc. But the rooms are fresh and updated, and unique in the fact that they have 2 separate bedrooms and kitchenette. My disappointment is that our room was on 3rd floor, right on Kuhio St, a very active street with buses, motorcycles, ambulances, you name it. The sliding doors must be from the 1960's as they are obviously single paned...you can hear every noise from the street thru the windows. The only saving grace is the noise from the AC units which slightly drowns-out the street noise. I asked to be moved to room on the courtyard side but no rooms like ours available on that side.

Yes it's not 5 star, but because of it's size and location, you don't need all the bells and whistles of the bigger hotels. Some people may not like the street noise but to be honest it never bothered us at all. If you're looking for peace and quiet, you certainly won't get that at one of the big hotels and really, Waikiki probably isn't for you. Maybe try Maui or another island.We found booking directly with the hotel gave us the best price. Kimari from the Aqua Bamboo was just fantastic throughout the whole process.The hotel is 2 blocks back from Kalakaua Ave and is less than a 2 minute walk to the beach. The pool area is just perfect - a real little oasis in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, The advantage of it being a small hotel is that the pool area is seldom busy and you can relax quite easily.Service from staff was excellent and everyone is friendly and welcoming. The US$15 per day Resort Fee is worth it for the use of the WiFi (both in room and pool side) and the endless supply of towels for use by the pool or the beach.We are already planning a return trip and we will be staying at Aqua Bamboo again without any hesitation.Mahalo Aqua Bamboo!!",,Darryl P,4,5.0

The building is showing its age, it is not 5 star, but if you are looking for a reasonably priced placed to stay it is a good choice. It has for us the following advantages over similarly priced hotel rooms:1. You get an apartment with a well equipped kitchenette. It slept the 4 of us comfortably.2. You can use their boogie boards and floating devices at the beach, saving on rental costs at the beach. They also offer free DVD hire from the Lobby.3.

The last was a privately owned unit that had been rented on Air B&B on the third floor. All three rooms had completely different layouts and quality levels. The privately owned unit had not been upgraded in a while and had some issues with too much furniture.

The service was fantastic. I took my mother to Hawaii for our very first time for mothers day along with my nieces and sister. The only thing that bothered me was that online it said that we could all stay in the same room since my nieces are babies but apparently theres a max of two people per room and that babies and small children were included in this. So I ended up having to pay for two rooms. However, the kind receptionist was willing to upgrade us to the penthouse at discounted price so my family could all stay together. The suite we stayed in was absolutely beautiful and clean and very spacious. It was very quiet up there and the staff were kind enough to help us take our bags up to the top floor. I was worried for the relatively cheap price the hotel was going to be shabby but it was very modern, clean, and well maintained. The best part about the hotel was that it was within a five minute walk to everything.

They hadn't activated the room-specific wifi, but I was able to tap into another room's wifi. When I checked out, I told the clerk about these problems, and he seemed totally indifferent. He didn't even offer the routine ""we regret your inconvenience"" line. But the main reason I'm giving them a poor review is that the clerk tried to charge me an additional $15 ""activity fee,"" on top of what I'd already paid through Trip Advisor. I asked him what this fee was for, and he said ""wifi and stuff."" There was no mention of this fee when I booked the room. To the contrary, the Tingo booking confirmation made it clear that $124 was going to be my total cost, including taxes and activities. The clerk asked to see my booking confirmation, which I showed him on my phone. He then ruminated over this a bit, and finally announced that he would ""waive"" the fee, as if he was doing me a favor.","Nordland, Washington","Eric N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nordland, Washington</strong>",13,2.0

We first had a condo booked for our 11-day trip but the place we booked was far off Waikiki and they weren't being straight forward about it on their booking website so after arriving, we decided to find another place to stay. We looked around and called a few places, Bamboo was able to give us the best rate. We came in and spoke with Ian at the front desk. Ian was extremely helpful and nice, he went out if his way (calling his boss) to gave us the rate that we were promised earlier (when we called and spoke to a female receptionist but unfortunately she was off by the time we got there). Besides Ian, there was another employee who helped us with our luggages. His name is Anthony, he always wears glasses, tall guy, he was also very nice and helpful cause he helped us look at a few options for parking garage (we have a rental).Over all I am very happy with the staff service (front desk, bell man, house keepers). The only one I have complain about is the front desk employee who works at night. He's an older guy, grey hair. I've stayed here 10 days and probably seen him about 7 times. And I totally understand sometimes you have a bad day and you just can't be your best self to guests.... But it seems like he never has a good day cause he's always very grumpy. And just last night, when we called front desk and asked if they could call us a cab, he asked where we were going and then told my husband, ""You probably better off just walk for a bit and wave them down cause it takes awhile if you call""..... Ok? First of all if we wanted to walk and wave we would have done it in the first place. There's a reason why we didn't do that. Anyway I called the cab company myself and one arrived only 10 minutes later. But like I said, besides the grumpy & unhelpful front desk person who mostly works at night, I am very happy with my stay here. And will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends.And we got a little departure gift from them! :) very sweet.","Seattle, Washington","Lieu0514</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",2,5.0

The other guests were also quite friendly and easy to talk to.I had Room 1206 which is a corner room on the top floor over-looking the pool and courtyard that came with a mini-fridge, microwave and supplies for tea and coffee. I liked the fact that it had two sliding-glass doors so I could open both and get a pleasant cross-breeze through the room during the day.I loved the location of the hotel on Kuhio Avenue just a close two blocks away from Waikiki Beach and the main shopping area. There were good restaurants close by along with the pizzeria in the courtyard and all public transport was within comfortable walking distance too.The only minor flaw to the room was the noisy air-conditioner and trying to figure out the remote control, but I had ear plugs and got the hang of the controller by the end of the week so just minor things.

Transfer from airport to hotel - We received a wonderful transfer shuttle ride from the Honolulu airport to the Aqua Bamboo hotel in Waikiki and the ride took about 35 minutes. Please keep in mind that even though the actual distance is about 10 miles, traffic is a huge issue in Honolulu/Waikiki. So prepare for longer times while travelling via bus/shuttle/car on the island of Oahu. The driver was excellent and very organized.Check-In - Upon arrival at the Aqua Bamboo hotel in downtown Waikiki we noticed that it is a smaller hotel (12 floors) and only 6 rooms per floor. But when we opened the front doors we found it very clean and first thoughts were that it was perfect for what we were looking for (i.e. a smaller boutique hotel that reflects the Hawaiian culture). There was bamboo everywhere! The staff and concierge were fabulous and welcomed us with almost open arms :). We had booked our vacation with WestJet vacations and contacted the hotel about a month prior to our visit and wanted to upgrade to the One bedroom suite with Kitchenette. We paid the hotel directly for the upgrade ($20 per night extra fee) at the time of check-in. Also note that about 50% of the hotels in Waikiki charge a tourist or resort fee of anywhere from $15 per night to $35 per night depending on the hotel. The Aqua Bamboo charges $15 per night for this fee. We knew about this previously so it was not a shock to us at all. Just be prepared for this extra fee! The concierge took us up to our lovely room (room 1104) which was huge! Room (one bedroom suite with kitchenette)- There is a separate bedroom (king bed) with patio doors to the balcony with two chairs on it with an ocean view. A larger TV and PlayStation 3 (for movies and game rentals...free). The bed posts and rails are bamboo and very unique, not modern at all, which was important to us on our vacation. There is a living/family room area with a bar/fridge and another set of patio doors that showed a view of Kuhio Street. The bathroom was huge with a deep tub and a lovely glass shower stall. Double sink and a toilet. There was a kitchen area with stove, cupboards, sink, table, chairs etc. and yet another patio door with another view of Kuhio Street. The large closet houses a safe which we loved. You can use a credit card to open/close the safe as needed (no charge for this). All in all the room was perfect for our needs and expectations! Well done Aqua Bamboo.Pool - There is a smaller pool area in the back area of the hotel. Don't expect any sun tanning until about 11:30am and the sun lasts until about 3:30pm. The pool is small/quaint and very clean. There is a small waterfall at the shallow end of the pool that was a nice addition. There are 10 large lounge chairs around the pool and about 5 tables with umbrellas and chairs. There is also two large covered areas for those who get burned in the sun (myself hehe). Adjacent to the pool is a wonderful pizza cafe called The Lovin' Oven. The pizza from here is old school (stone cooked and thin crust). We didn't actually buy a pizza from here, but we talked to several people who did and they give it a very good to excellent rating. The pizzas were pricey though at $25 to $30 each for a 16"". But if you like this type of pizza I am sure it is well worth trying it out. There is a manger's reception each Thursday evening from 4:30 to 5:30pm at the poolside where there is a singer with a Ukulele and free pizza from the Lovin' Oven and free Bamboozle's (an Aqua Bamboo alcoholic drink...great stuff) and smaller appetizer type treats. All and all very impressed with the pool area from 12pm to about 3pm for sunning each day.Extras - There is wifi in each room (a separate router in each room) so connections were pretty fast (I timed in 10 to 12 mbps several days). However there were times when the router needed to be power cycled (turned off , then on again) to improve speed. There is central wifi in the lobby and the pool area as well. All wifi is free (at least for our package). There is a PS3 in your room with free rentals (you get a card at the front desk upon check in) for renting movies and PS3 games from a machine in the back of the lobby area. You also get a beach towel card for free and there is a water and lemonade stand near the poolside doors. There is a free Waikiki shuttle (with an ipad at the front desk showing where the shuttle is) from the hotel to the Ala Moana shopping centre. You could walk to the shopping mall, but it is a 1 hour beautiful walk.Check-out - Check out was simple and there were no hidden surprises. The staff were excellent and very helpful. My wife and I celebrated her birthday and our wedding anniversary while were we were there. For both days I contacted the front desk and they arranged for extra flowers on the bed and for champagne and chocolate macadamia nuts....very classy and beautiful!Overall - I give this boutique type hotel a perfect 5 star rating. My wife and I will be returning next April for another two weeks stay for sure! Great job to the staff for making this hotel everything we could ever hope for on our vacation to Hawaii!If you are the type that like a modern type of hotel, don't look here! If you like old school Hawaiian charm and flavour then this is your hotel.

I booked it online on the recommendation of a good friend who goes to Honolulu every year for five weeks in November and who also ran her own B and B in Vancouver for over 20 years. I know from listening to her explain the standard that she had to have her rental suite that room 708 in the Aqua Bamboo on Kuhio Street would never ever pass a Canadian Health or Tourist Board inspection.My husband went out for a coffee, even though there were facilities to make one in the room, on the last day of our stay. Upon his return he chatted with an American couple that were checking out and learned that this was a “Condo/Hotel” not a real hotel. The couple own one of the suites and they said that their unit is lovely.I have never heard of this type of rental and would warn others about checking to see if the place you are considering is in this category.As soon as we walked into the room 708, I was stunned. I thought, what was Jane thinking to think that we would enjoy this dump?” We asked to change rooms but the woman on the desk said I had booked that room and couldn’t change it. It certainly did not look like the room I thought I had booked online. I saw a nice looking room with a king bed and an alcove off to the right with a kitchen and a balcony overlooking the nice courtyard and pool. What we got was a small grungy room with a king bed and a tiny piece of kitchen and a balcony overlooking the balconies of another building. These balconies looked like a slum because they were full of junk.The bed was the best part of the room. The mattress was quite comfortable although it did not fit the bed frame and we kept hitting our shins on the ends and even broke the skin causing it to bleed.Coming in the front door, the room smells damp and dirty. The closet did have a safe in it but it was black and near the floor. I had to turn on the flashlight on my IPhone and get down on the floor to see to set the safe correctly.The bathroom is disgusting. The taps in the tub look as if they are from the 1950’s. The shower nozzle is ugly and nasty to touch to change the pressure. The tub never looked clean. The sink appeared to have a laundry tub drain as opposed to a standard drain that you can open and close so you can fill the sink with water. There was no fan in the bathroom so after a shower the mirror looked like the windshield of my car after I had driven 200 miles. I had to open the bathroom door to let the steam escape so I could see in the mirror. The glasses in the bathroom were neither changed daily as is customary nor even washed and dried. The vanity counter was not cleaned nor was the sink. We began to test the housekeeping staff and sometimes they passed the test but more often they didn’t. One day there were no face cloths left for us and another day no dishcloth. The tea towel was terry instead of linen. The towels in the bathroom were well past their best before date and should have been used for cleaning rags. The Kleenex was so rough that I began to bring home serviettes from the hotels where we ate to avoid using their tissues.The kitchenette was small, beat-up and black. The whole room appeared to be black or brown and so was very depressing. Even the inside of the bar fridge was black. The cutlery was similar to what you would find in a soup kitchen. The cutting board was stained and needed to be bleached. There were no placemats or serviettes provided and the furniture was beat up and damp to touch as were the walls. There was a desk and a chair but you couldn’t use it and have room for anyone to pass.The room was very noisy so we didn’t get much sleep. We could run the air conditioner and not hear the TV or turn it off and sweat with the heat and not hear because of the noise of the traffic. The ceiling above the old -fashioned room air conditioner showed water damage and the walls were damp and cold. The window treatments were shoddy. The blackout curtains were ripped. The sliding glass patio door needed to be replaced and did not have a screen so we couldn’t leave it open for fresh air anyway. If you looked at the edge of the carpet at the threshold of the balcony it was all ripped instead of being finished properly.We spent as little time as possible in this room. As a result we spent time in the lobbies and restaurants of many other hotels that were all much more to our standard. It was wonderful to arrive home on Wednesday night to a clean, fresh, elegant quiet condo.When my friend phoned today to see how we enjoyed our stay she was shocked to hear about the horrible conditions of the room. She phoned the management company who acknowledged receiving my very negative survey and pressed them to contact me personally and offer me a rebate and an apology. A 50% rebate would not be out of line and if you are considering staying at the Aqua Bamboo Hotel in Honolulu make sure that you either don’t accept room 708 or make them prove that it has been totally gutted and redone. I will be sending a copy of this to my friend, to the management of the hotel, to Trip Advisor, and to the appropriate Health authorities in Honolulu. R.

Our 2 rooms were booked approx 6 months prior where the rooms requested were on a high floor and pool facing, due to the fact that this was our 3rd time in Waikiki and know how very noisy it is. On arrival we find we are on the 4th floor and facing a very noisy Kuhio Ave, and my daughter and her boyfriends room faced a brick wall, a view I'm sure they wouldn't want for 3 weeks. The complete opposite to what was requested. I would think when you have guests staying for such a long period and in 2 rooms that you would do absolutely everything you could to meet those requests.When I went back to reception to request a change of rooms, I was told we could go to a higher floor, still not pool facing, but not until the Monday which was 3 nights away. The bathroom was problematic from the start, the shower is in the bath and would not drain so you were standing in 6 inches of water while showering, not very hygienic. My daughter commented a few times that our room stank of sewerage and I was to find out why after about 8 nights in that room. The toilet was blocked up and waste was coming up out of the toilet. A janitor was sent up with a plunger which was absolutely disgusting, the whole floor was putrid while he was plunging! I had to go to the lobby so I wouldn't vomit.That worked for 1 night, the next morning, the same thing. Reception were only happy to move us to another room when I said you need to find us another hotel, until then there were no vacant rooms. We could only stay there a few nights though as the room was booked for incoming guests. We were given a lovely room on the 9th floor, the drainage issues however were the same. I believe they need to strip out all the plumbing and renovate all the pipes.Our last room was again quite good but the drainage was still a problem. So for our 20 night holiday we moved rooms 4 times! I felt like I spent half my time packing and unpacking.We found the staff to all be quite nice when approached, but didn't feel like any of them went out of their way to be particularly friendly.Would I stay here again?

It then resulted in us having to use a 'recommended' third party who was hours late bringing our stuff back with no working phone to contact him on, stressing us out on our holiday. We contacted Aqua Bamboo to get them to help us but they didn't want anything to do with us! Funny that?The room itself was musty and smelled like mould, even with the doors open and aircon blasting. Airconditioning was ancient and incredibly loud (when it worked, I had to reset it several times manually whilst balancing on a chair), both my partner and I struggled to sleep that night. The bathroom was tiny and had weird red stains all over the walls (photo does not do it justice, it reminded me of a horror film!). Also my partner found unexpected 'hairs' in the toilet, which just topped off an awful experience and made us super upset. Stayed one night then got a partial refund for the rest of our stay.

On-site pool is salt water, and smaller size, but great if you need to cool off. Beach towels and chairs are provided at desk.On a side note, If you're looking for great places to eat, there is a place a little ways away called 'Da Spot Health Foods & Juices' - which is an amazing place to eat for cheap (10$ for a huge plate) - they serve many types of chicken & other meat dishes....worth looking them up on google.They offer parking for $25/day or you can park a few blocks down at the Waikiki Banyan for $15/day. Boogie board & umbrella rentals are pricey at the beach (10-20/hr) so we ended up buying some cheap boards and umbrella at Walmart and just leaving there rather than packing home.If you have a car and want an amazing beach with white sand, blue water, and no rocks/coral, check out Kailua Bay (Kailua Beach Park) - parking can easily fill but you can also park down the residence streets or in the back alleys - just park in front of someones house - everyone does.",,Rod B,3,5.0

The zoo is close by and the parks between the zoo and the beach have BBQ, tall trees and beach rest rooms. The staff is outstanding!

But it was clean and comfortable. One of the only negatives is that it sometimes took a long time to have the room serviced, up until 3.30pm, and this was slightly inconvenient with a toddler.The only other thing I would like to bring to other travellers attention is that when I checked in, I was told there was now a $15 a day service fee. I refused to pay this as it was not a cost that was published when booking through my travel agent (all of the motels in the area that have a service fee are listed on the agents system) and I explained one of the reasons I actually chose aqua bamboo was because it did not have this fee. It was sorted out and I did not have to pay for this in the end but was told that it will be a compulsory fee very soon, so this is something to be wary of fellow travellers!

Raymond made some poor excuse about washing on the balcony, and he was dropping off our departure gift (we still had 2 days before checkout). My wife told him we were not checking out and he should check his list, Raymond then said "" I better wear my glasses next time"" and left. My wife checked our belongings went and checked on the children, and then reported the incident to the front desk. They said that they will report this to the manager and she will be in contact. The next day my wife was asked by the front desk staff to write a statement of what occurred which she did straight away. The only correspondance we have received to date is an email from the area general manager, Kahealani Colon, the day after we had left Hawaii, saying that he agrees that this incident needed investigating and he would be in touch ina few days to advise the outcome of their investigations.

By way of background, our travel agent in the UK (DialaFlight) had misunderstood our requirements and the type of room we wanted (something with a separate bedroom with a closeable door) and had booked us a regular room. Luckily we found out about this before we left as we had been in contact with Aqua Bamboo to arrange a crib for our baby son. To cut a long story short, DialaFlight kindly picked up the bill and upgraded us to a ""one-bedroom suite with full kitchen"". When we arrived, the upgraded room was not really what we had in mind. It was on the 4th floor and it did have a separate bedroom, but the living room had two single beds which took up quite a bit of space in addition to a kitchen with a huge refrigerator. It was also facing the front of the hotel alongside Kuhio Avenue which was a little noisy. To be honest with the sound of the AC, we did not really notice the traffic noise, but large vehicles such as buses woke up our little boy which was not ideal. We asked the lady behind the desk if we could move and she said that was difficult as the hotel was full, but she would see what she could do. True to her word, the following morning she offered us the same room on the floor above with two futon sofas instead of single beds which was a much better arrangement with regard to a toddler having space to play, but said if we could hold out another night they would move us to a ""one- bedroom suite with kitchenette"" on the 12th floor. This was an excellent room - lovely tiled floor, windows around two sides (nice views of mountains), huge very comfortable bamboo bed, bathroom with his and hers sinks, living area, kitchenette with refrigerator, hob, microwave, toaster & coffee maker and another fridge in a small ""bar"" area. It also had a huge TV in the bedroom and a smaller one in the living area. The maid who serviced the room was excellent and worked around our schedule with our son to make the place very clean and tidy. The front desk staff moved all our luggage and other items for us without fuss. We were so grateful for their help in swapping us to this room - it really made our holiday and their was no charge for the upgraded accommodation even though we did offer to pay! We also did not need to pay for the crib which I understand is normally $30 per night. As this was on the 12th floor, the traffic noise was much reduced which was great for our son and there was plenty room in the living area for the crib and his toys. A really good result for us - thank you Aqua Bamboo!The hotel is nice - there is coffee/lemonade/flavoured water available for free downstairs in the lobby plus free newspaper. Whilst we were there, they put PlayStation 3s in all the rooms and you could rent games and films from the Redbox kiosk in the lobby for free. The pool is small, but the whole courtyard area is pleasant. On Thursdays, the manager hosts a reception where you get some traditional drinks and snacks and also make a lei or two. The biggest advantage is the location of the hotel. It is two blocks (5 minutes walk) from the beach and the main drag through Waikiki. There is some limited parking under the hotel, but we used the parking garage next door, as it was easier and the same price of $25 per day with in and out privileges.We also saw filming of Hawaii 5-0 both on Waikiki Beach and in the streets around the hotel. We could see all the action on one day from our balcony - it was really cool and an extra bonus of our stay.In terms of other things we did as well as Waikiki beach, we toured the entire island by car, ate shrimp from a van, went to the north shore, went shopping and visited the outlet mall, strolled around Waikiki, went into downtown Honolulu and I went on a day trip to the Big Island to see Hawaiian Hawks (I saw 6 - makes me wonder how I missed them on the previous two occasions I have been there!).We had a great stay and I would recommend the hotel to anyone but choose the room type you want carefully","Telford, United Kingdom","andy_on_the_road</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Telford, United Kingdom</strong>",1,5.0

The staff was pretty nice and helpful and they do a few activities at the hotel that are a nice touch (e.g. free cocktails and snacks on Thursdays for Happy Hour). Our room was clean, but the set up was a bit odd. It was basically set up like a 1 bedroom apt with a kitchenette. The ""living room"" had 2 futons that were comfortable, but fairly no-frills. The cushion on one of them kept slipping down and didn't sit properly. Not a huge deal, but it's that lack of attention to detail that is an issue. Our room faced the street, but we didn't find street noise to be a huge problem and the AC unit drowns out the noise at night. Also, the view we had from our balcony was actually pretty nice towards the mountains on the backside of Waikiki. The decor throughout the hotel is dated, but not really in a kitschy way. We spent little time in our room or at the hotel in general, and we didn't miss much.

If you're looking for something large, corporate and with all sorts of modern touches and flair, then the Bamboo is probably not for you. If you want a reasonably priced room that's close to everything Waikiki has to offer, then I would recommend the Aqua Bamboo.Positives:- My girlfriend & I walk everywhere on our trips and the Bamboo's location is excellent. Less than a 5 minute walk to the beach, 10 mins to the zoo, 15 mins to the aquarium, the main shopping and dining streets right outside the door, bus stops right outside...really everything you can ask for within short walking range.- We got a clean, quiet room with a comfortable bed on the 10th floor, nice sized washroom with plenty of storage, closet with safe and free and fast wifi.- Free use of beach towels with a convenient system of replacement and free use of beach chairs.- Refreshing ice tea and lemon water in the lobby.- This was our 3rd trip to Honolulu and we've definitely paid a higher price at other hotels for a similar experience. I would say that the best thing about the Aqua Bamboo is the value you are getting for a reasonably low price in Waikiki.- Prompt email and phone responses when we made certain inquiries about our reservation.- Received a bottle of bubbly and a box of chocolates since it was my birthday during the stay. Thanks Bamboo!- Secured front entrance after 10:00 pm.Negatives:- Being on the 10th floor, street noise wasn't an issue however the air conditioner was quite loud. If you're a light sleeper, then the a/c in our room would keep you up at night.- Cleaners were friendly when we met in the hallways, but might have been a little inconsistent in doing their job in our room. Nothing major, but worth noting.- Front desk staff were friendly enough when we approached them with certain questions, otherwise they kept to themselves whenever we walked in & out of the lobby. This was consistent with morning, afternoon and evening staff. My girlfriend and I are accustomed to front desk staff being a little bit more openly welcoming. Again, it's not a major disappointment, but worth noting.We would definitely stay at the Bamboo again. It has such an excellent location and as long as you're not expecting a 5-Star hotel, then I believe the many positives outweigh the few minor complaints.","Vancouver, Canada","VanCityChamp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",58,3.0

We booked it as we wanted to use it and it costs more than a standard room because of the kitchenette. It was a sink with a microwave above it... one person only could stand in there... so it was completely pointless to pay extra for a sink and a microwave. when asked is there was anything a little bigger or spacious they told me that it would cost extra. we stayed there for 10 nights and obviously that meant nothing to them in the reason we wanted a bigger room. There are mini ants or bugs everywhere. all in our cutlery and over the table, desks. those the rooms were cleaned well daily these insects returned every day....there were 2 balconies. 1 was complete unaccessable as the bed is bolted to the floor in its doorway. So for staying again 10 days we could only open it by going onto the bed and climbing over it. the other balcony had a door but nothing to go out to. it was 20cm wide this balcony.So this hotel is central and clean but choose wisely the kind of room you book.

Miss Aja at the front counter made the trip exceptionally well, after being on a flight for over 14 hours due to delays, she made sure I had everything I needed and was comfortable. My only issues, and they aren't big ones, were the inconsistent hot water, and the rather slow internet. Hot water is negligible, it's Hawaii and you don't need to take a ridiculously hot shower, and the internet was good enough to check mail and make a few posts to social media so as I said, these are not deal breakers!

We are all 55+. Normally I book all our holidays online myself but since we were taking a one-week Hawaiian Island cruise first and then staying 2 weeks in Honolulu after that, we decided to have a travel agent handle all the arrangements and book flights, cruise, transfers, and hotels. This was all booked early in May 2013. Several weeks before we left on our holiday our Travel Agent called the Hotel to confirm our rooms and request quiet rooms, close together, overlooking the courtyard. She assured us the requests had been put on file at the hotel. On arrival at the hotel late on a Saturday afternoon, we were told we had rooms side by side with a city view. When I advised the staff of our Agent’s requests, they told us that they had no record of our requests on file and that there was a $20 per night additional fee for a room overlooking the courtyard. You would think they would have given our Travel Agent that information when she called!? Although disappointed, we went up to our assigned rooms. As we always do on a holiday, the first thing is to check out the view from the balcony. To our absolute horror, our view was of a brown brick wall just a few feet from our balcony!! We immediately returned to Reception and told them that the rooms were absolutely unacceptable! After booking almost a year in advance, that was the best view they could give us, in Hawaii, at $190 per night plus tax!! They assured us that no other rooms were available but that they would try to get us different rooms in a couple days. That evening they did inform us that they had arranged for us to move in 2 days time to rooms overlooking the courtyard at no additional cost, with one room even having a full kitchen, although they were on different floors. We agreed! Once Monday rolled around and we were actually moved into our new rooms with a courtyard view and no wall in sight, we could finally unpack, relax and begin to enjoy our holiday. Oddly, the new Studio kitchenette room assigned to our friends was much, much larger than either of our original rooms. The first rooms were basically the size of any regular hotel room with a mini fridge and microwave in a short wall of cupboards. Not sure how they could be classified the same and valued the same!?? During those 2 days our friend did visit a few other hotels and found out that we could easily have had equal or better accommodations in the area for a much lower price. After having caused such a ruckus, and just wanting to get on with our holiday, we opted to stay put for the duration. On speaking to other Aqua Bamboo hotel guests we did learn we had been charged substantially more than many others for our rooms.  That all being said, the ‘new’ rooms were large and comfy and we enjoyed our stay and our holiday. The lobby area, and pool area were always nice and clean. The pool was tended to daily. Our cleaning lady could have done a better job. There was hair behind our bathroom door for the entire 2 weeks of our stay, so I don’t think it saw a broom or vacuum once. The beds were comfy and the kitchen was great to have. Wi-Fi was available in the rooms and in the courtyard for Free, and that was much appreciated.We were within easy walking distance to Waikiki beach, many restaurants, a grocery store, liquor stores, a market, and many ABC stores. The bus stop is right nearby so it was certainly easy to get around, and there is a car rental place just around the corner. There is a small restaurant in the courtyard which is open for lunch and supper, with a small menu, but the food was good.Fresh apples were in the lobby each morning, although you had to get down there fairly early to be sure to get one, as they disappeared quickly and were not replenished. Iced tea/lemonade, coffee and tea were available at all times in the lobby, which was a nice touch.The staff was very helpful when we had questions for them, and the Concierge was very good. We booked several of our tours with him. Honolulu is a lovely place, but if I was to visit there again, I would search out a hotel that was closer to the beach instead of in the middle of town, and a little cheaper, especially when staying for a while. Had the wall-view not started off our stay on a sour note, it would have been a much more positive experience, as we had a good time there. It is a relatively small hotel, so not swarming with people, which is what we like...and the courtyard was nice to have.My suggestions if planning to book at the Aqua Bamboo, is to make sure you are getting a good rate and that your requests are on file. Maybe had our agent made our requests by email instead of phone, it would have been better, as I would have had a paper-trail and proof that the requests had been made. Don’t hesitate to stay here though; it is a quaint little hotel, close to everything.","Winnipeg, Canada","LJG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Canada</strong>",49,4.0

Kana was extremely helpful when I could not get the printer to print. As well as when he checked us out of the hotel. It was a smooth experience.

If you are looking for a five star resort, this may not be the property for you. If you enjoy a BBQ, with a glass of good wine, under a palapa enjoying the sound of a waterfall, tikki torches blazing, in a jungle setting then this is the best kept secret in Honolulu. For us, we get to enjoy all the amenities a big city has to offer but then when we choose time for some tranquility we are in the perfect location. Our family has a tradition of what we call ""the dine around"" which means one family member is responsible for one meal over the holiday. It is fun, saves money, offers a few laughs and everybody gets a holiday with the exception of the one day you are, ""on"". One family member even threatened to order in pizza, which would have been a treat had they picked it up at the onsite restaurant called, ""Luv' n Oven"". The hotel is showing its age, the décor is dated but the rooms are exceptionally clean, very comfortable, with great beds. The mini fridge, sink and two burner cooktop offered some manageable challenges for the cook. It was tough to find enough room for the beer and vegetables in the mini bar fridge.Saving the best for last, thank-you Nicole for your understanding and the effort put into fixing my internet diabolical.

We have stayed at Aqua Bamboo Waikiki on a number of occasions and have found the staff to be extremely helpful, nothing is too much trouble - from changing cash to organising a tour. They go out of their way to make your stay the best ever in Hawaii! The room we stayed in was # 1001 (10th Floor) - it was extremely comfortable, quiet, spacious and had generous sized lanais/balconies with comfortable seating and privacy. It was serviced daily, often before 11.00am, which suited us because we were swimming or shopping in the morning and so welcomed coming into a clean and cool hotel room which had been freshly serviced. As far as security is concerned, you need a room card to get into the Hotel Lobby area (and then into your room) from 10pm-6am daily and there is even a night guard who patrols the outside of the lobby ensuring that entry is authorised and guests and staff are safe. The pool/spa at the back of the Hotel is absolutely wonderful and therapeutic with tables and chairs (under shade protection) if you want to rest and/or read a book/magazine. Something, perhaps unique to Aqua Bamboo Waikiki, is the ""Bamboozle"" evening which the Management put on for Hotel (and invited) guests every Thursday between 4.30 and 5.30pm. This is a wonderful opportunity to 'mix and mingle', make new friends whilst enjoying the original Hawaiian entertainment, generous cocktails/food all in the serene and beautiful bamboo setting. We have enjoyed the weekly ""Bamboozle"" evening for a number of years and can thoroughly recommend it. Being set only one block back from Waikiki Beach, and with the Food Pantry, Pharmacies, ABC Stores, Department stores like Macy's and the main Kalakaua Avenue Hotels such as the Moana Surfrider, Royal Hawaiian, Outrigger Waikiki within easy walking distance, the location of the Aqua Bamboo Waikiki Hotel could not be better! Also, the bus stop taking visitors to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre or around the island of Oahu, is directly opposite the Hotel as is the bus stop for visitors wanting to go to Diamond Head, Sea Life Park, the Kahala Mall/Hotel, etc, and is just next to the Hotel, 5 minutes walk down the same side of Kuhio Avenue. This is the best Hotel which we have been privileged to stay at in al the years that we have been vacationing in Hawaii (since 1988).

Pool area has lush plantings making it feel more secluded....you kind of forget you're in the middle of town. - Our room was plenty big enough for the two of us, had 2 queen beds, and we were surprised to see the little kitchenette, which also came stocked w/dishes, pots and pans!! - Nice robes in the closet.- Blonde concierge, she was VERY sweet and helpful. I'm sorry I don't remember her name.- We had street view room but only heard sirens and large trucks, not bad at all- Were always acknowledged when coming and going past front desk- No noise from neighboring rooms or other floors- beds and pillows goodThe Not AS Good, but very minor -- coffee in lobby. Go out door to the left a couple of blocks to The Coffee Bean- A/C was a little loud for me, but I still slept.- Thursday Manager's ""meet/greet"" was ok...veges and dip, chips, popcorn. There was pizza, but not even enough for all 20(if that) ppl there to have 1 of the 2"" x 3"" pieces they offered. Bamboozal drink was pineapple juice, Midori melon liquour and club soda, ok but a bit weak. I was a very nice gesture for management to have this get together, but I didn't see anyone from management ""meeting and greeting."" There were enough flowers for 4 ppl to make leis.Overall, I feel this is a very nice hotel and would consider staying here again.

We reserved the one-bedroom suite with kitchenette, as we were traveling as a family and it is always nice to have that extra space to stretch out a bit. We were very pleased with the room. It was tastefully decorated, clean, and comfortable. We were on the 10th floor and we had great views out all the windows of Honolulu, Waikiki, and the surrounding mountains. Even a nice balcony where we could sit out and enjoy the beautiful weather. We were only two blocks from the beach, which was great, and a quick walk to all the Waikiki shops and restaurants. I thought the room was a very good value compared to many Waikiki properties. It was right on the bus route also, which was very nice as we did not rent a car and we were able to get to Diamond Head and Pearl Harbor very easily. There is a very pleasant outdoor courtyard with a small pool. Not sure the pool was great, but the patio was a very tranquil and relaxing place to sit out and enjoy. Only small complaints were about the plumbing (which seems to be a common issue with many hotel properties). The toilet was constantly running at a very low rate. Also, there was a lot of water which leaked out of the shower stall. As it turned out, our room also had a shower in the tub, so after the first day, we just didn't use the walk-in shower anymore and that little problem was solved.

It's located only a block away from the beach, so it avoids the crowd and hubub of Waikiki shop-a-holics while still remaining a stone's throw away from the ocean! My husband and I checked in to celebrate our anniversary and we got upgraded to a suite on a high floor so we even have a partial ocean view - all we mentioned was our anniversary and the very friendly woman at the front upgraded us right away! The staff is so friendly and they also made sure we had a room on the pool side to avoid street noise so we don't have trouble sleeping. The hotel has a beautiful ambiance of bamboo and our room is so clean and refreshing with three balconies; the view of the city at night is so great! And as if things couldn't get better, on our first day we arrived back to find chilled champagne and chocolate macadamia nuts waiting for us to celebrate our special day! The hotel does not have complimentary breakfast, but it does have a cute little lunch/dinner cafe by the pool that isn't very expensive. The pool is so cool and refreshing, and has a little waterfall to drown out street noise (clever) and also has a tiny two-person hot tub, which is rare in Honolulu (and was important to me, because not matter how hot the weather, I love hot tubs). And to make it even more refreshing, the hotel offers iced tea/lemonade and chilled water as well as tea/coffee all day for guests and you can rent clean all-day beach towels. I will never stay anywhere else in Waikiki. This place just goes to show that you do not have to spend a fortune to have a wonderful vacation.

The good: Great location, very close to the beach, shops, car rental, etc. The staff are excellent, there are free towels and chairs for the beach as well as boogie boards that can be loaned (no charge), good pool area (pool a bit cold and spa a little small, would bother some, but not me), laundry facilities onsite (have to pay) good size room (not massive though) with separate master bedroom (very handy as we were travelling with a 2 year old). Good kitchen facilities.The bad: very, very dated (but TBH I expected this for the price), bench area in kitchen very small. The absolute worst part though is the noise from the street. We started on level 3 the first night and luckily upon arrival, the staff offered to move us to level 8 for the following night (without prompting), which made things better. The noise on level 3 was unbelievable!!! It was like we were actually on the street (which is a major street), there's no noise insulation at all. Level 8 was still loud, but tolerable. The air conditioner units are also loud, though we did manage to sleep through this. I cannot overstate this, you need ear plugs if you anything like a light sleeper.This would be a 2 star review because of the noise factor, but have left at 3 because of the little features like the staff that made the stay enjoyable.I'd still recommend this hotel and would definitely stay again. But... bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.

The pool area is very nice with comfortable chairs. I like that it's not a hotel with 2 or 3 hundred people. The location was great, close to shopping, the beach, and great places to run. The great service extends to the restaurant by the pool as well. The ""Lovin Oven"" has great food at affordable prices and the owners couldn't be nicer.

Sure in the photos they show some great sheets and linens with orange accents with wood trimming in the room, but once you're there it is totally schizophrenic. Sure, they invested in the nice sheets and some new wooden modern styled lamps and clothing drawers, but it was all very cheap so falling apart. The walls were all scratched up and stained like out of a horror movie, wooden furnitures chipped all over the place, the air conditioner was from like the 1960s and emitted an awful moldy smell (that, or it was the fridge), the bathroom was peeling. Worst of all, it was IMPOSSIBLE to sleep if you unluckily ended up with a room facing the street. Who knew for such a small street it would be so noisy. The patio doors barely close so all night you hear speed races zooming by, the bus, people at 2am walking back from the bars. Another thing was the internet didn't work at all the entire time we were there, checking in at 9am until departure at 11am, but well that was just a fluke incident beyond the control of the hotel.The common areas were even more horrifying- the lobby was a bad episode of Trading Spaces. They couldn't replace the old structure, such as the walls and marble flooring, but added some new things and it just makes it look tacky. The elevators were ancient, and the decor on the floors were just totally weird. If this is just to hang out with friends, that's fine but for a honeymoon or something romantic this place will be a huge disappointment.The strangest part was the parking situation. I don't know if they have a normal lot below their hotel, but I guess since it was full you have to park at the hotel next door. Absolutely scary. My god.On the positive side, the pool was lovely, lots of free newspapers, and breakfast had some nice coffees and simple eats. The staff was also great, I mean granted the hotel is what is physically is, but the people were really quick to address any questions and were really helpful.

It is a good location and an easy walk to Waikiki. The added bonus was that we could get twin beds for our kids. I feel that the staff tries really hard to accomodate your needs. We had problems with the air conditioning units in our room. Very finicky though we finally figured them out in the wee hours of the night and they are loud. The restaurant hours are not reliable. There was a notice in our room saying that they serve breakfast but they didn't and the front desk staff did not know what was happening with that. A little odd. We enjoyed going up to the twelfth floor and poking out the back towards Waikiki. The pool area was very pretty. Otherwise we were comfortable and felt safe.

I've read a whole variety of reviews on this hotel, and I honestly can't tell why people have left such negative reviews. I'm not the most forgiving person when it comes to my accommodation, but we found the Aqua Bamboo to be quite good. We purchased in advance for a decent rate (particularly in comparison to other Waikiki hotels!). The reservation agents were very cheerful and happy to answer my queries about our options.The room was a decent size and the king bed was very comfortable. It was also very clean. The air conditioner is a bit noisy but you do get used to it. The only down side is that the noise from Waikiki can be a bit loud at times even with the balcony door closed. The pool downstairs is small but quite nice, and they offer iced water, lemonade / iced tea complimentary to guests. After the long flight from Sydney, this was a blessing!We loved how convenient it was in location to everything. Aqua Bamboo staff were lovely, and the concierge service was top notch. The only thing I will say is to stay away from the in house cafe - it's overpriced for what you get, the lady that runs it is borderline surly and the food was pretty bloody average.All in all, we would definitely stay at the Aqua Bamboo again. I don't agree with their website's description of it being ""luxury"" accommodation but it was definitely a pleasant stay.","Melbourne, Australia","RantingJules</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",32,4.0

We chose this particular accommodation because we needed a unit with a bedroom with two beds (for the elderly siblings) plus a bed in the living room for ourselves. Many Waikiki one bedroom units have only one bed in the bedroom, so we were happy to find this.The Aqua Bamboo is very central to all Waikiki has to offer. It is right on Kuhio, the main bus corridor, and is a very short walk to the most lively area of Waikiki beach. Several restaurants are nearby, as is the Food Pantry, a pretty well stocked small grocery store.The hotel has a welcoming cozy retro vibe. Ceilings in the lobby are very low, which we noticed at some other Waikiki properties built in the 60's and 70's as well. There is a free beverage station (ice water, lemonade/ice tea, coffee) which we really valued. Behind the hotel is a tropical and secluded (for Waikiki) pool area - waterfall, pool, hot tub, comfortable seating, and BBQ. This was a very relaxed place to spend time, an oasis in the city. The pool water was cool (colder than the ocean), and the tiny hot tub was just warm. There is a small restaurant off the pool area - didn't eat there so can't comment.Staff we encountered at the hotel were warm and helpful. As you enter the hotel, it is necessary to walk right by the front desk (also the place where you pick up fresh beach towels) so we interacted with front desk staff frequently.Room 903 is quite unique - I would describe it as a beach cottage transplanted to the 9th floor. It has undergone renovations in recent years so is in pretty good condition. It has a fairly open plan and has a huge (party-worthy - not that we tested that) North facing lanai (600 sq feet I believe) including a table for 4, comfortable chairs and coffee tables under a palapa, 2 deluxe lounge chairs for sunning, and a full sized BBQ. A second lanai off the bedroom (East facing) has a nice ocean view. Although lanais were a bit noisy, it helped that we were on the 9th floor, well above the street. The main lanai was so comfortable that we ended up eating breakfast and dinner there all 3 days of our stay. We saw some great rainbows over the mountains from there.Beds in the bedroom were comfortable, but we found the futon in the living room to be uncomfortable for sleeping - a regular sofa bed would have been a huge improvement. The ""bedroom"" was separated from the living area by louvred doors only (something we new when booking - this seems to be common in Waikiki). The kitchenette was tiny and scantly stocked with dishes and equipment. We discovered at the end of our stay that we could have asked for more dishes etc. but we managed to make do with what was provided and didn't make a request.The bathroom was very functional (2 sinks, a stand-alone shower, plus a tub).We met several other guests during our stay and many were repeat customers of the hotel. They appreciated the hotel's location, comfortable atmosphere, staff, nice pool/BBQ area, and overall value.The Aqua Bamboo is not a new or 5* property, but it is clean, has had updates in recent years, is centrally located, seems to be well-managed, and offers good value. The ""luxury"" suites are unique and worthwhile to stay in - if staying in another room type I would probably request a pool view room to minimize noise and possibly catch a glimpse of the ocean. This hotel is a solid Waikiki choice and I would stay there again.","North Vancouver, Canada","kayteeYVR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Vancouver, Canada</strong>",274,4.0

Our room on the 6th floor faced the road and to be honest, noise intrusion was not too bad despite the reviews here. I agree that the a/c unit was noisy and leaked from the outside when it was in operation but you soon get use to the drone. Beds were made daily with the exception on 1 day and we had to request for shower lotion when it had runout.The location is only 1 block away from the beach, and is in close proximity to convenience stores (ABC and food pantry) and some decent and reasonable eateries including Me BBQ (Korean) and Marukame Udon. It is also situated on a principal bus route into downtown and beyond so there are numerous bus options from the bus stop opposite the hotel.Beach towels, floats, inflatables and surf boards are available to guests upon request to avoid unnecessary hire for the latter.We parked our hired car for several days in the hotel underground parking for $25 a night which is about the same charge as other parking that can be found in the area.","London, United Kingdom","hairylaury</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",18,4.0

Negatives - The locations makes it very noisy, not a great chance of a good nights sleep.Some staff were less than friendly. This goes a long way. When guests return to the hotel look up from your computer screen and say hello. Its this welcoming approach that some staff missed completely.

Unfortunately we did not find it to be so. The hotel states it had a far eastern vibe but we did not catch that, other than a few rather tacky attempts at an eastern feel (a couple of statues and plasticky walls). The area in the lobby has a very 1970s feel to it, with chintzy sofas which leads out to a small pool, which feels like someone's back garden. The room was very clean and good size beds, which were very comfortable, although they took up most of the room so there wasn't much room for our luggage. The room was very basic in decoration and unfortunately the view was of the wall of the neighbouring building. The air conditioning was also incredibly loud. The bathroom was clean but basic again, as was the 'kitchenette', which is a really just a counter. This was fine for us as we ate out the entire time and it was nice to come back and be able to make a hot drink before heading out again. The location is pretty good and the staff provide towels for the communal beach, which is about a 3 minute walk away. We would say this probably just reaches a 3* standard although the look and feel if the hotel wasn't to our taste.

It's only 2 blocks away from Waikiki beach and Duke's statue, and there is a busstop that serves all main bus routes right across the hotel. The front desk staff is genuinly friendly and nice. They would be one of the main reasons I would go back to the hotel.The housekeeping staff is also friendly and nice.

My room was kept clean in a satisfactory manner though, so no complaints there.The hotel has a nice, quiet pool area that is great for chilling and relaxing. I didn't make a lot of use of it, but it was nice when I did.Free use of beach towels and chairs are great amenities. I actually did not know that they also lend out boogie boards and blow up floaties - I just read that on here ... They should promote that more. I think I would have used it if I would have known. Other amenities include free wi-fi (fast!), an i-Pod/i-Phone dock system in the room (I was pleasantly surprised by that), free lemonade or ice tea/cold water/fruits and the manager's reception on Thursdays with free Bamboozle cocktails and snacks.The rooms are nice. The beds are so soft and comfy! As some have mentioned before, the AC do is quite loud. Also, if the hotel would do renovations in the future, double glazed windows would certainly be a good investment.

Staff were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them - they really made you feel welcome. The pool area with BBQ (which we used twice) was lovely, like a little oasis with beautiful tropical gardens and waterfall. Our room, a one bedroom apartment was clean and well laid out if not a little small but still adequate for three adults. Location was excellent and an easy short walk to beach, shops and restaurants. The free use of beach towels & chairs, blow up floaties, body boards & even surfboards was really appreciated and I think unique amongst hotels in Waikiki. The only bad thing about the hotel is the street noise, especially at the front of the hotel where our room was. Of course, we realise we were in the middle of a big city, but perhaps an investment in double glazed windows would help cut down the constant drone of cars & sirens and make the stay more pleasant. I'm not sure how bad the noise was in the back rooms overlooking the pool but I would request one of these next time. If you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs. The price for location is excellent though - it's a matter of budget. You can spend a fortune at the beach front hotels or stay here and have extra spending money for shopping, tours and dining. There is no bar at the hotel but we took our drinks down by the pool & enjoyed at lovely self catered bbq steak & salad purchased from the supermarket 50 metres away. A pizza restaurant, The Lovin Oven opened up by the pool two days before we left. We were going to have pizza and wine by the pool on our last night after a day tour but strangely it closed at 6 pm. It also serves breakfast for $6 which is a great price. I would recommend this hotel and would probably stay here again.

The unit was large, with a bedroom (2-beds), a living room (with a futon), functional kitchen, balcony and bath. Plenty of room to move around without feeling as though we were living on top of one another. My son, who slept on the futon, said that it was quite comfortable and he liked having a TV to himself in the living room. The queen (?) beds in the bedroom were also quite comfortable. We sleep peacefully, through the night. A bit usual for me as I am an incredibly light sleeper. If you have a chance, upgrade from a one-room unit to a suite....you won't regret it.The unit was expertly cleaned each day and the actual décor was pleasing to the eye and comfortable for our family of 3. I've been to Oahu 5 times. This was my first time with a ""city view"", as I've always opted for an ocean view in the past. I have to say, it won't be my last. I really enjoyed the view from our suite. In fact, we fell asleep each night with the drapes wide open....I really loved the lights on one side and the mountains on the other...quite a treat. The staff was friendly when approached, but I would have enjoyed an uninitiated, ""good morning"", ""hello"", etc. I must say, whenever asked, they always answered with a smile and were very responsive to any question or need. The tea, coffee, etc. in the lobby was a nice touch. I asked where I could buy the iced tea mix and the (very friendly gentleman shared), ""it's Lipton with lemons and oranges""....that was a surprise as it tasted wonderful...kind of like a high-end designer tea. We didn't get a chance to get in the pool, but it looked very inviting and clean. If you will have a rental car, be sure to reserve a parking spot at the Bamboo, in advance of your stay. The cost is $25/day. I didn't realize that parking was limited here, thus, due to lack of space, we had to park next store at the Pacific Monarch, which was $20/day. Unfortunately, when directed to the Monarch, I pre-paid for parking for our entire stay... before I actually saw the parking structure. Next time I stay at the Bamboo, and can't get parking on site, I will find parking elsewhere, as the Monarch's parking structure was not optimal. I've heard that the Waikiki Banyan has better parking and it's supposedly cheaper. I think the Wi-Fi was fairly new. The first few days, it slowed down considerably around 6am until about 6 or 7 pm. About the 4th day, it was down (altogether) for some reason. I reported it to the front desk staff, who indicated that the repair person was onsite working on it as we spoke. After that, the Wi-Fi was perfect. Maybe they were just working the bugs out. It was nice having laundry on site. We used it several times and never had to wait. Finally, I loved the location. We were 2 blocks from the beach and 2 blocks from the International Marketplace. In the past, I've stayed at the Aston Waikiki (at the other end of the strip), the Aston Waikiki Sunset and at private residences in Kailua. All in all, I preferred the location of the Bamboo. For the first time, I felt like I was truly experiencing Waikiki. I really enjoyed the Bamboo and would definitely return.",,wannabetraveler45,42,4.0

We had 2 king beds & a kitchen as we would be having grandchildren stay with us for 4 nights. Having a kitchen was a godsend as my husband is on a restricted diet & we were able to make most of our meals. There is a Safeway & Food Pantry nearby so that also helped. Fortunately we had a room that was off the street which proved to be an advantage as the city was doing road repairs on Kuhio. I won't mark the hotel down for this as this was not within their control. They also made every effort to assist those who were trying to drive into or out of the hotel.We loved the pool area. It was a quiet peaceful area to relax. There were plenty of cushiony lounges as well as adequate tables with umbrellas. They were all wood & not the cheap metal & plastic kind. There was also a more hidden area that had a large cushions lounge with pillows & grass roof where one could take a nice snooze. This hotel is located on Kuhio & is only a short 2 block walk to the beach & the activity of Waikiki. I cannot say enough about the friendliness of the staff. They always greeted us when we left & returned. We did surprise them once when we were brought home in a police car. They breathed a sign of relief when we told them that the police man was Ohana. We all got a laugh out of that. We will be in Honolulu again next July for a family reunion & hope we can book multiple rooms for all of our mainland family.

We are a military family on orders and were told there was no availability at the Army lodging, so we were placed in an approved government TLA hotel in downtown Waikiki. The hotel they placed us in was far from meeting even the lowest of Government Standards for military families during an extended stay. After some research I found Aqua Bamboo Waikiki on the Gov. TLA list and thank goodness I did. Nicole, the hotel Manager, was very gracious and accommodating to us during the entire process of switching hotels. We found this hotel to be conveniently located, very clean, quiet and all of the staff extremely friendly. The rooms are very spacious and updated with modern rock/tile flooring and bamboo furniture. We stayed 8 glorious nights in a king suite with a kitchenette with Aqua Bamboo until our on-post house was available. I wish we would have found this hotel sooner and never had the other awful experience. It's sad because our tax money is going to these other less deserving, crappy, run down hotels that have been on the TLA list since the 1980's and probably haven't picked up a paint brush since they got approved. While at Aqua Bamboo we enjoyed the pool, the complimentary towels and chairs for the beach, the free internet and parking for military and the ice cold lemon orange lea in the lobby.

It was the perfect temperature and the entire pool area is just a nice little place to hang out.

The walk to the beach took less than 5 mins and there are dozens of stores and places to eat all around. The hotel also has an on site designated smoking area, so you don't have to go stand out on the street (like in our other hotel). If you are expecting big rooms, big pools and big amenities, then you should go stay at a big resort. The bamboo is small and quaint with friendly staff.

Having contacted Nicole ahead of time (one of the managers) the staff was aware we had a couple of things to celebrate. We were quite ahead of check-in time and were told it'd be about 30-45 minutes...but that we could check our bags in (very secure by the way! they literally tagged everything and locked it up!) So we did just that, and set out to Waikiki for a bit. Not knowing where to go, we walked over to the beach and made our way back...not quite enough time, we were told a few more minutes but that we could surely use the pool etc. So, they opened the door that was keeping our luggage safe (I'm telling you, this was secure!) we grabbed our suits and swam for a bit...no more than 5 minutes later...one of the staff (I think he was security, porter and front desk!--I didn't catch names, so sorry about that!) let me know our room was ready....We dried off and got the keys, including the key swap for the towels (you exchange a card for these wonderful fluffy towels!) and headed to the most beautiful room I've ever seen!The staff had left a Mother's day lei and lovely note, a birthday cake for my daughter, some popcorn for my son and plenty of standard goodies (coffee etc) the room was SPECATUCLAR...we were half facing the city, but let me tell you, YOU CAN SEE THE OCEAN!!! (go out on the veranda!) We were technically on the side I suppose.The room was decorated very very tastefully, it was Hawaiian, and Buddhist? but very peaceful and Zen-like...decorated tastefully in beachy colors/earthy colors...lighting was just enough, and I took note of the efficient bulbs and other things that are good for the environment! There was a kitchen that you could literally cook a full meal! pots, pans, plates, glasses...cups...silverware...fridge, stovetop and microwave (knowing this now...I'll be sure to ""Upgrade"" at the Bamboo and have this kind of kitchen!) because Waikiki food is spendy, it'd be easy to cook some stuff up at this home away from home...The bathroom was amazing, nice big tub...separate shower...great bathroom goodies (body wash, shampoo/conditioner, soap, lotion) ample for the three of us (I made sure I let housekeeping know--more on this amazing woman in a moment!) But the supplies are ample and quality!The coffee in the room is delicious! The water from the tap is fine to drink, I drank a lot of it...no taste or anything (I know in this day and age people are funny about tap water, I am not one of those people and this water was delicious!)Downstairs there was always coffee and chilled filtered water (good for filling up bottles etc!) and lemonade as well as lemon water...one day they made sweetened tea (and I noticed it went faster than the lemonade...maybe i had something to do with that!) There were also apple available all day and there was tea available too!This hotel is central...right there on Kuhio, it's steps to the bus (how we traveled to the further points) and everyone can tell you the fast way of how to get there...(they will mark the short route on a map even!--lifesavers!)At night, there is security out front...we didn't see anything near the hotel of concern...the colorful characters we saw were on the beach (but mostly people just doing things for a tip--making their living) nothing of concern really...and since I had children with me, we didn't venture out much after 930-10...but, the security outside was a nice touch and believe me no one would mess with him :) I'd come downstairs to get on my laptop and he'd pop in and say hello and of course the front desk person always made sure everything was good.When coming and going you'd be greeted like family (""where you off to today?"" or they'd recommend a place to eat (coupons etc) or upon returning ""Did you have a good time?"") etc it was like coming home...The Bamboo felt like home....no, let me repeat that.The Bamboo felt like home.It was the staff that really made this stay...yes, the building and pool/yard was beautiful...but it was the people...On to the housekeeping...the room was IMMACULATE! I believe that service industry people should be acknowledged...it's a tough job, usually underappreciated/underpaid...(maybe I've worked enough of these type of positions to be able to empathize) but, i also recognize EXCELLENCE in work. Housekeeping...she was adorable!! I got to see her the 3rd day, she thanked me for the ""gift"" (tip) and we had a lovely conversation about our kids (her child's bday was the day before! 4 years old!) and I let her know there was another ""gift"" waiting for her in the room...upon coming back that night everything was refilled a-plenty and the room was spectacular...with my daughters stuffed animal placed right on the bed :)Again, it's the people.The one and only thing I'd ask of this wonderful hotel would be to provide snacks, a fuller breakfast or something (more food) for those staying under the Bamboo roof...Waikiki food (eating out) is EXPENSIVE...but, again, knowing about the kitchens...next time we will grocery shop and do some of it ""at home""...otherwise...I'd change absolutely nothing...The air conditioning was quiet and almost too cold lol...sure, there was some city noise...but you are not only in Honolulu...but in the heart of Waikiki...there's going to be noise...You're not in the countryside somewhere...!!!I wish I'd have caught names of people...perhaps Nicole will respond and fill it in with names...:) But my recommendation to anyone that reads this? (I'd read feedback before booking) Stay nowhere else!!!Bamboo, our heart is still there...You guys made a lifetime memory for us!

The hotel also provides beach chairs and towels free of charge. The hotel staff is friendly. The pool area is nice and has a tropical feel. When we were there, the pool area was not crowded at all, so it was great. It's a relatively small hotel, so the pool itself isn't very large which was fine for me. As to the room, it was fine. Not really luxurious, but suitable. I honestly was expecting the room to be a big bigger as we booked the ""Studio Kitchenette Partial CityView"". I wouldn't call it a studio. It just seemed to be a standard sized room with a counter and kitchenette. Our view was a parking lot and balconies of the next-door hotel.

Out the back, the pool area looks lovely but we didn't use it.We couldn't say much positive about the service. It was a bit like amateur hour and the staff seemed disinterested. I think that this hotel also acts as a serviced apartment facility so this might impact on how the staff behave maybe.Our room the first night was in the Moderate room and it was really below par. Pretty crappy looking, extremely tiny and very underwhelming. We were disappointed after reading such great reviews. I've included a pic of the bathroom, which was quite rundown, as an example.The second time we stayed we had a $15 upgrade and the room was SO much better! Heaps of space, room for a family really, with a separate kitchenette. The amenities were much nicer in that room and we had a much more comfortable stay.I would recommend Aqua Bamboo for its affordability and centrality to Waikiki but don't stay in the cheapest room - pay a small amount extra and get an upgrade, it's definitely worth it.","Melbourne, Australia","Heavypetal1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",16,4.0

I do wish the sliding door had a screen on it as we probably would have slept with the AC off and window open if there had been a screen. The hot and cold water faucets in the shower seemed to operate backwards, but once we figured out which way to turn them, that was not a big deal. We had a mini fridge and kitchenette with dishes and a toaster that we used to do our own breakfast and keep left-overs. The location is very convenient and everything you might want is within walking distance. We loved the pool area and spent a LOT of time there. As others have noted, the pool is not heated, but on a hot day that was not much of a problem. It's a little oasis in the city jungle and was generally very mellow. We never had an issue getting a place to sit.

I booked this hotel because I was looking for a 1 bedroom suite which offered 3 beds (all queen), close to the beach, with a pool, at an affordable price. Aqua Bamboo Waikiki offered all of that and had great reviews. When we arrived, we were quite shocked at how small the room was. By using the sofa futon as our 3rd bed, there really was no ""living"" area and the kitchenette was tiny. Also, we were on the 10th floor and the traffic was extremely noisy. Those were the only negatives. The positives made up for everything and I would recommend this hotel to people looking for good value. The room was very clean, the beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was quite large (2 sinks, bathtub and separate shower). The patio was tiny and you had to climb over the bed to access the patio, but we got used to that after a while. The pool area was very quaint and quiet. Most of the time, we had the entire area to ourselves. It was very convenient to grill up dinner (nice bbq beside the pool) while the kids were swimming. Then we would have a nice candlelit dinner beside the pool. The staff were exceptionally nice. One of the staffmembers even tried to refuse a tip. The hotel offers beach towels, beach chairs and boogie boards....which was a huge convenience. Also, the hotel offers lemon water, iced tea and a water filtration system. We refilled our water bottles everyday.....another huge convenience! The location of the hotel is great as well. Only 2 short blocks to the beach, 1 short block to the best-priced surf rental shop, very close to the main strip, but just far enough away from it. The Koren BBQ (across the street) and Ruffage (half a blk away) were 2 great food finds....inexpensive, healthy, and great quality.

A lot of time was invested in researching different hotels and ultimately, I selected this one based on the attractive accommodations, location, and price. Not to mention, I waited until Cyber Monday rolled around so I could take advantage of the discount code, which saved me good chunk of change and made this hotel even more budget-friendly. When finalizing my reservation for a one-bedroom suite with a kitchenette, I requested a room above the pool (based on previous suggestions) and asked for two queen beds so it would comfortably fit a family of four. Although that particular accommodation was unavailable above the pool, the staff was able to provide an amazing room that was high enough to escape the noisy streets. Room 1003 was immaculate. It included two queen beds, a single futon, two televisions, a DVD player, two mini-fridges, a small dining area, and a large bathroom (with two separate showers). Yes, my jaw dropped when I walked into the room for the first time; in fact, I am still stunned by the room and I didn't find any problems like previous guests. The A/C was quiet, the room was spacious, and nothing appeared outdated. An outstanding element to our stay was the hotel staff. The employees were very friendly, helpful, and exuded such warmth--it was obvious they really put their guests first.Aside from the room and hotel staff, the available services and amenities were viewed as perks; for instance, the free beach towels and chairs were perfect for toting around Hanauma Bay. Plus, I would occasionally fill my reusable water bottle with the chilled lemonade and iced tea situated in the lobby. The hotel itself was in a prime location, it was right across the street from the bus stop, a couple blocks from the beach, and near two cheap garages (Waikiki Banyan, $12/day & Pacific Monarch, $20/day). Overall, I am more than satisfied with all this hotel has to offer and I would stay here again.

The wood trim that runs across the ceiling, starts and ends abruptly. Lack of, simple attention to detail. It's like the room was unfinished.The washroom is a bit on the older side. No fan for ventilation. There's simply a hole in the wall with a grill and mesh for air to travel in/out of the washroom to allow air to flow. The problem is, noise also flowed freely. Which means, you can hear buses go by, people screaming, the garbage truck picking up the trash. If you're from a newer trendier city, this washroom would be considered clean but you would only find a similar one in a trashy neighborhood.The rooms all have a more traditional hold in the wall air conditioner. They are constantly on and the problem is they are located right above and beside the bed. The hole in the wall for the air conditioner also allowed noise from the busy street to flow into the room. So not only do you enjoy the noisy streets in the washroom; you also get to enjoy it all while in bed as well.The better?- Location is not bad. It's relatively close to the beach and close to the shopping.- Pool is decently modern. Has a hot tub. It's also very small though.- Parking was only $25 if you parked with them. $20 if you parked in the building to the right of them.- They have a kitchen in the one bedroom with a small beer fridge. Although, pictures we saw had a picture of a full size fridge.- Room was clean.- Staff was decent. They reminded us that we would not get our money back because we booked our stay as a package when we left midway through our stay. Felt a bit like being locked into a cell phone contract but it was either that or suffer through lack of sleep for the rest of the vacation.Cons:- You may not be able to sleep through the night- It's a little run-down even though it's gone through renovation (which I'm only aware of because I've read the other reviews)- Somethings you just can't renovate to make it newer. The building is just older. The rooms are just older, the air conditioning is the type that will be loud.- Internet in the room is wired only. Apparently, it's high speed internet. In this day and age, where you can get a wireless router for $60, needing a wired connection is just strange. Most tablets are not wired. If you had a MacBook Air for instance, you can connect to a wired connection without an adapter. Phones are mini computers these days (surf the web, check your email, ...) and they don't connect to a wired connection. Really, you'll need to bring your own wireless router with you to be able to connect all your wireless devices. There are many travel routers you can bring with you. It's just that, you shouldn't be expected to bring one with you in this day and age.- It wasn't priced as a budget hotel but better hotels on the beach were not that much more expensive if you shop around a bit. Got a better hotel through a walk-in special deal for roughly the same price per night.- The one bedroom unit only offers a TV in the main living room area. The bedroom itself has no TV. Which is usually not the norm since a budget TV can be around $400 - $500 these days.","Calgary, Canada","LazyTravelDude</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",5,2.0

Well, so it said but actually we had 2 rooms and 1 bath, and a full size stove and fridge and kitchen sink squished in. The bedroom had a queen bed, closet and dresser. The main room had 2 very small singles, a TV and those gigantic appliances. Every room is quite different from another. There was no option to have a 1 bedroom facing the pool. CONS:There was no room to do anything but sleep! Tiny roomVery noisy, street traffic is pretty much 24/7 and not muffled at all.A/C also noisy but keeping it on helped drown out street noise at nightFree Wifi only available in the lobby and complicated to connect toPROSgreat staff, all of them.Nicole at the front desk is awesomeLobby has all-day free and fresh lemonade, water, coffee and tea(Another review said these are $1 but that is only if you want cappucino/speciality coffees)pool area is nice, lots of chairs and loungesrooms and common areas cleanthere's a weekly (Thursday) happy hour with complimentary beverages, their signature cocktail and snacks (pupu's)Front desk will provide complimentary beach equipment, chairs and boogies boards for your usegood location in Waikiki, 2 blocks to the beach and 2 blocks to International Market PlaceWe enjoyed hanging around the pool, but other than sleeping we spent all our time outside the room and generally off the property. This hotel would probably be better suited to young couple or single traveller because of the small room size and space.

By booking this package, we were able to save a few hundred as compared to booking the rental car separately. The hotel was very easy to find and is just a block or so from the beach. Upon arrival, we were greeted with smiles all around and pleasantly surprised to find out that our studio kitchenette had been upgraded to a 1BR suite with kitchen!!! Room 1204 was absolutely gorgeous and a few feet from the laundry machines. It also came with two balconies (lots of sunshine and not bad on the noise levels), kitchenette (equipped with microwave, stove, sink, appliances, silverware and fridge), a futon, minibar, 2 televisions (albeit one is very tiny), spacious bathroom and comfortable ""living room"" area. It almost felt like we were living in our very own apartment. Aqua Bamboo location could not be beat. We walked a block to the beach and about 5 minutes to International Marketplace and several other restaurants and shopping locations. Compared to many of the beachfront accommodations, I actually liked being a little bit away from the main strip where it was much quieter and less crowded. Getting to/from the freeway to explore the rest of the island was also more convenient away from the crowds.The service was perfect. Our room was always cleaned spotless with several orchids placed on towels and pillows. Every time we saw anyone from the hotel, we were met with smiles and 'Aloha's'. There was also a small reception by the pool on Thursday evenings where snacks and drinks are served. Aqua Bamboo also lets guests borrow beach towels and chairs free of charge which was also a nice touch. All in all, a great and pleasant stay at a cute hotel. My husband and I spent most of our vacation island exploring, on the beach or doing water sports, so all we were looking for in our hotel experience was a nice place to come home to in a great location within our price range. Aqua Bamboo fit the bill for that. My only recommendation would be to call and reserve parking because the garage is quite small (fits about 10-12 cars) and the uphill driveway to get out can be a bit scary since you have to look out for pedestrians and can't quite see over the driveway.","San Francisco, California, United States","Julie T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California, United States</strong>",0,5.0

I was checked into room 1105 and was immediately disappointed with the size of the tiny room. Not much space to hold our luggage or walk around. We also had an outdated bathroom. It was as if they remodeled everything else and forgot the bathroom. The vanity and the tubs looked like they were from two decades ago with rust stains. I am beginning to think that the inconsistent reviews stem from all rooms not being renovated to the same level of completion. On the positive side, it was a great location. The staff were very courteous, helpful and professional. I was happy to have free drinks, including lemon infused water and iced tea in the lobby that varied from day to day. Coffee and tea in the lobby required $1 vending machine payment and lobby internet station also required payment (but was free at Aqua Waikiki Pearl when I stayed at its sister hotel 6 months ago). Laundry on the other hand is very affordable at this property.","Calgary, Canada","JY_Globetrotter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",194,3.0

Lovely hotel, wonderful Staff and perfect location. We were given a room on the 10th Floor which had ocean views, a nice little balcony and lots of room for my daughter and I. We made great use of the loan beach towels and my daughter love being able to borrow the bucket and spade each day. The only thing that I would like to change is the temp of the pool and hot tub. Pool was very cold and hot tub way too hot... I know I sound like goldielocks! =)The Staff would have to been one of the best assets of the Hotel. They were very helpful, always happy to see us and took the time to make sure we were having a great holiday. Found the washing machine and dryer very handy especially with a toddler who seemed to get icecream all over her clothes everyday. Rooms were very clean and had everything we needed.

We emailed before we arrived to ask if there was any possibility of a 'nice' room as it was a special trip for my 50th birthday. We did indeed have a 'nice' room. It was 1006 and it was at the back of the hotel with views of the pool and the sea. It also had a little balcony at the side with a table and two chairs. I think the rooms that end 001 and 006 are the best rooms and the higher up you are the better the views. The little kitchen was great although we didn't cook a thing!We used the (free) hotel beach towels and beach chairs every day that we went to the beach and these saved a small fortune because on the first day we discovered that if you wanted to hire two sunbeds and an umbrella for the day it was $25!! crazy prices.

We were looking for something a little more local (show your slippers...not bedroom slippers...thongs for you malihinis...for 10% off your room rate) off the ""main drag"". When we arrived we were really pleased that, on their own, the hotel had upgraded us to a suite on the 10th floor! Why? We don't know, but we were VERY thankful! The suite was beautiful with stone floors, a pebble floor walk in shower and huge tub in the Bathroom, kitchenette, more electronic entertainment options (there was a whole drawer full of remotes) than you could possibly use...unless you were staying a week...a sitting room, huge bedroom (the only down side was that you had to climb over one bed to get out onto the lanai!). The property has a sweet little pool and lounge area and it so happened that we were there on a Thursday night when they have snacks, cocktails, and entertainment for everyone staying there. That was a nice social experience! The property is mixed hotel and owners who have units there that they use either for vacation or live there year-round, so it doesn't have the feel of a ""resort"", more like a small neighborhood.

The tiny kitchenette was useable and sufficiently stocked with utensils. The bed was comfortable, furnishings tasteful. The noise in the room was bad from outside traffic on Kuio Avenue.

The rooms are on a par with UK hotel rooms in size BUT fabulous little kitchenette if you want to make lights snacks, teas, coffees etc. Also coffee, teas etc free in reception. No WIFI but you do get free internet via wire connection (wire supplied by reception to fit laptop free of charge). The pool is FABULOUS! Small but beautiful. Warm, clean and private (if you don't mind being overlooked by skyscrapers on 2 sides BUT didn't bother me!!). It is only 5 mins from Waikiki beach and the main street with all of the designer shops and restaurants. Get the bus if you can. Get to see the real island. ALSO GO TO THE POLYNESIAN CENTRE!!!! AMAZING DAY!! You get to experience ALL of the differing cultures of Polynesia. We also took a day trip to the Big Island by plane (Hawaii) - not cheap, around £300 each BUT well worth it. Also took a 1 hour helicopter tour over Maui, amazing sights and well worth the money. I would really recommend this hotel as value for money. If you stay on the main street you will be charged at least £250 to £500 per night for a hotel and you're never in the room because it is such a beatiful place.","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","KarenL699</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom</strong>",35,4.0

The hotel staff is amazingly friendly and helpful, definitely demonstrating the Aloha spirit. Our room on the 8th floor, had everything we needed, as promised. A king bed, a desk, a table, several chairs, a mini-kitchen and a small balcony with a couple of chairs. Although our room was near the balcony on which the washer and dryer were located, we never heard it. We also were not far from the elevator and never heard any noise from there either. In fact, we pretty much didn’t hear anything the entire time we were there except for twice when we heard police/ambulance sirens, which you would probably heard anywhere you were, except maybe a soundproof vault. (They run those sirens really loud!)The lanai (balcony) was small and didn’t overlook anything particularly interesting, but we really didn’t have any time to sit around there anyway, since we were quite busy.The kitchenette area includes a microwave, a small fridge, a sink, two burners, a coffee maker, and several cabinets and drawers. It was stocked with various cookware and dishes. We didn’t have need for any of them except the glasses and one sharp knife, but if you need them, they are available.There was daily maid service, though it usually took place later in the day (I suspect they first clean the rooms of guests who have left so that they can be available as early as possible for newly arriving guests.) The beds were made, the room was cleaned, the towels were replaced (including the little one for the kitchen), the soaps and shampoos were replaced/supplemented, as were the tissues and toilet paper. Just what you would expect from a good hotel.The king bed was comfortable. The bathroom was an acceptable size and the water pressure was adequate.Check-in was very quick and efficient. They have a cart for piling up your luggage. The elevators are smallish, but we were able to get all of our luggage, which was on the cart, and ourselves, in at one time. The elevators were fairly efficient and we never waited long for the elevator.The L-shaped lobby with Bamboo theme has free cold filtered water (lemon water)(the water in the room is fine for drinking too, by the way), brewed coffee (regular only), hot water with a selection of teas, apples and local newspapers.Although the hotel is not “on the beach”, it is a mere 2.5 blocks from the beach. Now, one needs to understand what a block is in this case to have the appropriate perspective. In Manhattan, there are long blocks and short blocks. These blocks in Waikiki are shorter than the short blocks in Manhattan. In other words, the two blocks are really short. Another way to look at it is that it took us longer to walk to the beach at the Hilton Hawaiian Resort from that hotel’s front (when we went to the Atlantis Submarine Ride), which is “on the beach”, than it did to walk to the beach from the Aqua Bamboo. The Aqua Bamboo has a collection of “left behind” beach equipment they are happy to lend you. They also give you beach towel cards which you can exchange for beach towels each day. For my wife and myself we got 3 cards, one for each of us to dry off with and the third to sit on at the beach.Note, too, that the Aqua Bamboo is very close to that part of the beach where the “Duke” statue is and also to the area where the free hula shows are held on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday. (Get there early for a good seat.) It is also around the corner (1 short block) from the King’s Village, where they do a changing of the guards/flag lowering ceremony. There is plenty of shopping in the area, since the Bamboo is located in the heart of Waikiki.One area that can use improvement is the parking situation. The parking is in the basement and there are very few spots for $25 per day now. If you want a spot, you should reserve it in advance. The spots are very tight, it is difficult to maneuver you car, and the ceiling is low or has low pipes in various spots. On the bright side, they valet park and retrieve your car between 8 AM and 10 PM. However, if you have to park it yourself or retrieve it yourself, it is a pain. The friendly staff did help me a couple of times outside of regular hours when the regular valet had left.The concierges were quite knowledgeable, in particular pointing us to Queen Emma’s Summer Palace, which is on the way to the Paali Lookout, Byodo-In Temple and the Polynesian Cultural Center (all of which we did in one day) and to the “easy, new” fork up the final stretch of Diamond Head. The front desk staff was excellent and they were also very helpful at directing us.On our last night we went to the hotel’s pool and Jacuzzi. Although the pool is smallish, it is appropriately sized for a boutique hotel, and the pool area is very nice. There is also bar-b-que equipment available for use.As for Internet, I brought a short cable with me and used the wired internet in the room. It was quite adequate. I’ve read that they have Wi-Fi in the lobby and pool area, but I didn’t test it myself.We’d like to give a shout out to P.T. at the Island Colony Hotel (a sister hotel to the Bamboo), a wonderful warm and caring person who helped us select the right hotel from the Aqua family of hotels.The Aqua Bamboo was very conscious of the fact that this was a trip to celebrate our 25th anniversary trip and they helped to make it a very special trip that we will remember for the rest of our lives.","Edison, NJ","EugeneR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edison, NJ</strong>",9,5.0

We weren't planning on being in the hotel that much while we were there and it was in the perfect location to get to the beach, restaurants and shopping. I had read all of the reviews on here before booking. I liked that it wasn't some huge hotel. The whole staff was very friendly, check in was easy and our room was clean. I had my bouquet included in the package we had bought separately for the wedding, otherwise I would have had the lady at the front desk do mine. I heard from others she is really good at that and she also had offered. On our wedding night they surprised us with flower petals in the shape of a heart on our bed, a box of chocolate covered macadamia nuts and a bottle of champagne. The pool was great after long days out when we didn't want to be around crowds. We didn't have any problem with noise the whole time we were there and they were actually doing work to the outside of the hotel that week. I would definitely go back.

He also recommended where to go and what to eat! Great job GREG! Well done on your excellent customer service! Was totally impressed! The cleaning ladies also left us enough towels tissues to use everyday! They did a basic room service bathroom clean and tidy beds! But they were always friendly smiling obliging to our needs at all times. CONS too noisy!!! On the main road where the bus stop is across the road! The construction work seemed to go on forever nearby with jackhammers! Our room faced the street so sleep was a major issue because the doors to open the balcony were extremely hard to open! We requested someone to come and look at it but no one came! We couldn't stand the air con too noisy DIDNT work properly the one in the next room that the people were using was left on all day and night and it felt like it was in our room so noisy! No soundproofing! We ended up using both hands full force to open both the doors then got a beautiful breeze but unfortunately the noise was just too much plus leaving the door open we got birds coming into our room! I don't think I will stay here again! TIP book 3-6 months in advance for any hotel or condo in waikiki and it will be more reasonable, i cant believe how much the price hikes up when you book weeks before going! learnt the hard way when I wanted to book the trump 6 months earlier the room that we wanted was $5100 for 5 stars with kitchenette 2 queens but before booking the bamboo week before coming the price jumped to $12,000 for the same room more than double so I def won't be doing that again!

I found the hotel to be very well located, a very short walk to the beach, yet much cheaper than the beachfront hotels (though not cheap, nothing there is). They provide beach towels and beach chairs that you can take where you're going.The rooms were very clean. We switched rooms from a 1 to a 2 bedroom after one night only because of girlfriend issues, not because of the room (that's why I said rooms in plural). They were very accommodating with this switch and we could move from one room to another directly, no need to pack everything out and wait.Beware that on the 2nd floor is their laundry and maintenance area, and it can be noisy, all the housekeeping carts move through there, so I suggest avoiding the 2nd floor.The pool and pool area are small but well maintained and very inviting.The parking lot is very small and somewhat inconvenient to get in and out, and its an extra 25 per day.The staff was always nice, fast and accurate.

Thursday night manager cocktail reception with live music was also a nice treat. Very clean everywhere! If there was any problem, it was corrected immediately. The only negative thing I have to say is that the pool was freezing which was odd. When I asked about this I was told that the pool does not get enough hours of sunlight. I would imagine this to be less of an issue in the summer. The other issue which was really the most important has to do with a foul odor in the room which came and went. In all fairness to the Aqua Bamboo, the sewage problem is a city problem and something that is being worked on in several locations. During our stay, several areas near the hotel were having new pipes installed under the sidewalk. Therefore, this may have been a problem for us due to the location of our room.

First and foremost, the location. Dining, shopping, the beach, and the heart of Waikiki are all in easy walking distance. The bus stop was right across the street, too. Staff members we encountered were nice and helpful. The room was clean, our small kitchenette was nice to have, with a mini refrigerator to store leftovers. There were refreshments and fresh fruit available in the lobby lounge area. This was nice to grab after a day at the beach or on the way out to a hike.I had a couple questions prior to our arrival. I emailed the guest services manager, who responded quickly, kindly, and with care that I received the information I was looking for. This was very appreciated. We were there during the tsunami scare and we felt that the staff handled it professionally. They called our room to be sure we were aware of the situation and to let us know where we could get help or answers to any questions. On the other hand, the air conditioner was insanely loud. We had to raise the tv volume up loud enough to hear over the a/c, and we were concerned about disturbing our neighbors. It was even louder if you went to sit on the lanai. We had to keep the a/c going most of the time because the room was incredibly humid. The room appeared a little banged up in places. The somewhat tight quarters and the design of the bed legs left us both stubbing our toes repeatedly!What I felt was needed more than anything was some kind of fan in the bathroom. There appeared to be mold spots on the ceiling (I'm assuming that's what it was?) Clearing out steam after a shower took forever. Towels wouldn't dry, let alone things from the beach. Speaking of which, a clothesline in the shower would have also been very helpful. The room smelled a bit like a musty basement. Even understanding the proximity to the beach and island climate, it was just a bit much sometimes. It was nice to have a private lanai, though people kept smoking on theirs (I thought this was illegal?), which would waft into our room. We could see the city and mountains in the distance, but mostly our view was the rooftop of the building next door. We were able to pay to extend our stay later in the day since our return flight was not until later in the evening. This was very helpful. We were not able to get an answer about whether or not this was a possibility until the day of, which was a bit inconvenient. Hard to plan ahead without knowing if we had to check out in the morning or could stay most of the day. We were able to book this ahead of time at the Ilikai. Reading other recent reviews during the same dates as our stay, it sounds like other people got some nice automatic upgrades and anniversary perks. We saw that the person who took our reservation had made a note of our anniversary. The gentleman who checked us in only noticed it at the last minute and mentioned ""Happy Anniversary"". No upgrades or anything or champagne like others received (maybe they paid for it? no idea.). Not that we expected it, but having read other reviews, now I'm kinda bummed! We've had good experience with Aqua and the nice people they employ. Again, the location was wonderful. I just doubt we would go for this hotel again.

I wasn't too sure what to expect and after a 22 hour journey to Hawaii I was pleasantly surprised with the hotel. As soon as we arrived the hotel staff were more than friendly, they were very informative and took time out to assist us. Our room was very clean. After we checked into our room, i realised that my best friend had been in contact with the hotel and informed them that we were on our anniversary, it was evident that we were upgraded and we were provided with a bottle of champagne and some chocolates. I thought this was a lovely touch and I was overwhelmed...thank you. My only gripe with the hotel is that it would be great to have some ventilation in the bathroom. The hotel itself is in a great location, it's in walking distance to everything in waikiki. The hotel have nice touches like providing beach towels. They also have complimentary ice tea or lemon water which is so refreshing after being in the gruelling heat outside.

I am not in the habit of writing negative or critical reviews, but in the end we had more issues with Aqua Bamboo than we’d like. We were also considering the Outrigger Launa (similar price and amenities) and we would try that next time.Price: We booked via Expedia and paid ~$280/night for the hotel (1 Bedroom + Full Kitchen) and a full size rental car. Before we arrived – Crib Request: I emailed the hotel a week prior to our arrival to request a crib be put in our room before we get there, as we would be arriving late. They responded promptly letting me know it wouldn’t be an issue, and reminding me of the $30/day charge. I was floored - cribs have been offered for free in every other hotel we have ever stayed at! I checked their website and Expedia, and the charge is listed, so they weren’t making it up. I called them, and (very politely) enquired about the fee - surely it must be $30/stay, not $30/day - that would be well over $400. When told it was in fact $30/day, I asked if they thought that was reasonable. ""Well, that's what we charge..."" I asked to speak with a manager, who was not available at the time, so we arranged to have one call me back. Nicole called me two days later and offered to charge me $15/day, and when I protested she offered to waive the charge. I am glad she called me back and took care of it, but it was a hassle as I started looking into alternatives such as taking or buying a Pack N Play. Wait until you see the picture of the crib…Check In: We arrived around 11pm after a long flight and short (20 min) drive from the Airport. I was disappointed to find out I couldn’t park at the Aqua for the first two nights of our stay, and that I would have to park next door at the Pacific Monarch – the price is the same ($20/day) but they apparently are very strict and required me to sign a waver. Strange. Anyway, we were given room 504 and I was surprised to find it was 1-Bedroom with Kitchenette vs. the Full Kitchen week had booked. I went downstairs to ask to be moved into the type of room we had booked, and the woman at the front desk didn’t know that our room did not have a Full Kitchen - she even asked me if I looked everywhere for it (the room is only ~600 sq ft large). She did not want to reassign me because she wasn’t sure which rooms have Full Kitchens, and then she decided they were all occupied, so I would have to be moved the next day. I expressed my disappointment that they did not have the room I had booked months ago ready, and let them know that being moved the next day would be a major inconvenience given we had two small children with us and a tonne of luggage. I also let them know that I planned to grocery shop for our two week stay the next morning and that not having the full size fridge available would be a problem. They tried to blame the problem on Expedia (they mess up room types) and then on me (I should have booked directly with the hotel.) I told them that this was getting off on the wrong foot, I parked in the garage next door, which ended up being a four-story walk-up (no elevator!) and went back to the room annoyed, to find my wife and the kids in a room booked for four that only had towels and bedding for two. I called the front desk and additional linen quickly arrived, along with the promise to move us to a room on the 8th Floor the next day. The next day we got up and went shopping, and were allowed to put our groceries in the refrigerator in the new room (807) while it was being cleaned. By 4pm the next day we were finally situated. Not a great start. Location: The location is great on Kuhio Ave, just two blocks from the beach. Lots of places to eat nearby, as well as a Food Pantry store. The International Marketplace is just a couple of blocks away, as well as all of the shopping and action on Kalahaua. Coffee: Both the coffee in the room, and the coffee available in the lobby, was weak and terrible. They didn’t have a normal coffee maker in our room (it was a single serve one that takes packets instead) so we couldn’t buy coffee and make our own. Strange, as we had heard coffee is Hawaii is great. Parking: $20/night. When we did park inside we found a very small (very old) garage with room for around a dozen cars. It’s really tight down there; we had a full size car and had to be careful parking. I would contact the hotel in advance if you require parking during your stay. Room: Our room was as expected given the photos available on Trip Advisor. We had two twin beds in the main living area with a flat screen TV, office table and chair, and small breakfast table with chairs for two. There was a full size stove and fridge, microwave, single use coffee maker, and stocked kitchen. We had to request wine glasses and a cork screw from the front desk. The bathroom and bedroom had everything you would expect, as well as a safe in the closet big enough for a laptop. There was only 1 dresser for the four of us, so we had to request additional clothing hangars from the front desk as only 5 were provided. Our room was north facing on Kuhio so we did have some traffic noise (especially the bus) which was somewhat offset by the very loud air conditioners in each room. Although we had sliding glass doors to get outside, the balcony was very small and had no furniture. Internet: Wireless in the lobby and pool area, but wired in the room. I knew this in advance and was prepared, but could see it being a hassle for those traveling with ipads. I even found being wired to be inconvenient after the first couple days. Sanctuary / Pool Area: This is the best part of the hotel. A nice-sized salt water pool (no chlorine smell) and small 4 person hot tub, in a well shaded area with palm trees and other plants. There are lots of loungers and a few day beds, as well as tables for people who bring food and drinks. There is a BBQ Grill for guest use, as well as a sink. Bathrooms on the pool deck are always locked, presumably for security reasons, but running to the front desk to get the key for my toddler every 20 minutes wasn’t fun. Manager’s Reception: We attended the first Thursday and had a few Bamboozles and some snacks. The music was nice, and it was the busiest the pool area was our whole stay. It was a fun thing to do before heading out to watch the sunset and have dinner. Beach Stuff: They provide cards for beach towels available at the front desk (lost cards = $15). They also have lightweight beach chairs and boogie boards/floating toys for people to take to the beach. Smoking: The hotel is non-smoking (most are in Waikiki), and they require you to sign a contract on check in that says there is a $350 cleaning charge if you smoke. Unfortunately the guy in the room next to us for ~5 days either didn’t care, and was heavily smoking marijuana at all hours in his room or on his balcony. The smell was so strong it was like someone was smoking in our room. We complained each time we could smell it (4 or 5 times) and they didn’t really do anything about it. They told us he had been charged the cleaning fee twice, and the last time we complained they offered to move us to a different room. I flatly declined the offer as we were not the ones breaking the rules (and law) and that moving would be a major issue given the amount of stuff we had unpacked. They called the room later saying they had threatened to call the police if he did it again. Service: Overall the service just wasn’t great. I sent a case of beer to my parent’s room before they checked in, and asked that it be put in their fridge so it would be cold when they arrived. They found the case sitting on the floor in front of their fridge, and had to go to the store for cold beer. On another occasion I dropped my credit card in the elevator and it fell down the shaft. I alerted the front desk and they told me to cancel the card as it cost $350/hour to have the elevator technician come and retrieve it. I tried again the next day (it was a different lady) and she had the card for us no problem an hour later. Strange. Check Out: I requested late check out at 4pm (our flight was not until 6:30pm) and was told I could only stay until 2pm, although there was no extra change. When I did check out it was quick and easy, the only charges were for parking ($20/day for 11 nights.)","Richmond Hill, Canada","MikeInRichmondHill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond Hill, Canada</strong>",109,2.0

The ""city view"" was really the view of an alley, so having a balcony wasn't a enjoyable feature.

The next morning we complained at the front desk and they were extremely helpful and accommodating. They resolved the problem and provided us with a newly renovated deluxe room instead! We were so happy! Just as a note, i believe there are renovating all the rooms, so if you going now you might be ok. Our new room, was amazing! Overlooked the pool and everything. We could even get a hint of the lobby wifi. The location was great. Within a short walking distance of Waikiki beach and all the shops and restaurants.

Everything was very clean, everyone was super friendly, even the guests. The hotel was not ""perfect"" but that's not what I was expecting. When we first got there the hot tub was stuck on boiling hot, then it was normal. It got hot again later in the week but since we saw how the maintenance person fixed it we just did it ourselves (lol)The staff were extremely wonderful and helpful, in any and all questions we had. They went above and beyond to make the stay wonderful. the guest services manager was so nice and wasent ""hiding away"" in an office, almost everyday we saw her at least once. The only thing that wasent perfect in the room was a bit of paint peeling right above the AC (Which is kind of understandable) they were also in the process of changing out the older AC like ours. Any complaints you hear about loud AC must be from people who have never been around the ""in the window"" type AC, it was not any louder than mine at home. Its like a fan blowing air. I would most definitely stay at this hotel again. The guests were very nice and were just there to have a nice vacation, no one was ""stuck up"" like a lot of the hotels in the area. Just as an FYI there was a family that was staying at the bamboo for part of their trip and then staying at a different one for the other half, they left for the other hotel only to come back to the bamboo.

The staff were hugely accommodating, friendly and knowledgable. We had a missing walker for my mom after our flight, subsequently required a wheelchair and then needed the right transportation to get all of us to the cruise port. Front desk staff helped with all of this. They knew a taxi driver who had a large enough vehicle to take all of us with luggage, a wheelchair and a walker and they ordered it. Both of our rooms were updated with only the windows and a/c being a little tired. Our room was a perfect set-up for a family travelling with any age children. There was a bedroom with queen bed and then two single beds in the open area. Even with four adults plus luggage, I didn't feel cramped. A pool side room would have been great both for view and less street noise though no one in our group was bothered by the street sounds.

Here's my experience in a nutshell....When I arrived, I was informed by the desk clerk that the hotel was out of parking spaces on-site, and I would have to park in the parking structure of the hotel next door. The price was the same, $20/night. So, after dropping my bags off in my room, I had to drive to the hotel next door, park outside in their driveway and go inside to have someone open the security gate which closes at 10 pm (guests of that hotel are able to use their room key card to open this gate - but guests of the Aqua Bamboo have to get this assistance). I parked on the third level and walked down the parking ramps, eventually exiting by way of an emergency exit since my key card wouldn't get me access to the normal stairwell.As for my room, #1002, it was extremely small, but clean. The problem I had with the room was with the air conditioner. It vibrated terribly and I didn't get much sleep. At one point, I even tried stuffing a shoe between the air conditioner and the wall to try and stop the vibrating, but that didn't work. I tried calling the front desk to complain about it, but didn't get an answer, and being tired from a 5 1/2 hour flight over and a long day prior to the flight, I decided to tough it out for the night and address the issue in the morning.I spoke with the desk clerk the next morning and she advised that she would get me moved to another room by the afternoon. I left for work, and when I returned at 5 pm, I was given the keys to room #710. THIS IS THE ROOM YOU WANT TO STAY IN AT THIS HOTEL! It was a suite with a full kitchen. Very nicely appointed. The hotel staff had moved all of my personal effects to the room while I was out.... right down to the bottle of water I had left in the mini-fridge. The room also had THREE balconies...one which faced the swimming pool with chairs and a table for relaxing. This room was perfect for my stay, and made my experience a very good one.The room did lack wi-fi, however there was a cable in the room to plug into your laptop for internet. Unfortunately, I travel with an i-Pad, and there is no way to connect. There's free wi-fi in the lobby, but for some reason, I never was able to connect to it. I ended up going to the Mac 24/7 restaurant in the Hilton down the street where they offer complimentary wi-fi. Luckily my smart phone brought me all of the email and essential internet service i needed while in the hotel.The pool area is nice, with plenty of lounge chairs. There's also a hot tub. The trees and greenery give the pool area a ""tropical garden"" feel.The lobby is nicely furnished, but a bit dated. This is a older hotel, but they've done a good job of maintaining the public areas. From the lobby, to the narrow hallways, to my room(s), EVERYTHING was clean.The staff at the hotel are very courteous and attentive. I appreciated to smiles and welcome I received in the morning on my way out, and upon returning from a hard day's work. A+The hotel sits on the outer edge of the tourist areas so the glamour that is prevalent a few blocks away is somewhat absent, but even so, it's a nice little hotel, with great staff.","Vancouver, Washington","cuffemdude</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Washington</strong>",21,3.0

Check in was at 3pm and we were left sitting waiting in the lobby cause they couldn't even be bothered to let us know or rooms were ready. We finally grew tired of waiting and asked them when our rooms would be ready and they responded that our rooms were ready a few hours ago.....yet they didn't bother letting us know when we're just sitting in the lobby waiting for our rooms. We get to our rooms and aesthetically, it looked nice. The beds were lumpy. the sheets were rough. The kitchen stove and fridge were not leveled and would rock back and forth if you bumped into it. The cabinets would not close properly either. The pool was dirty looking. The water looked cloudy and the pool deck was very dirty. I didn't want to talk around barefoot.

Had I wanted to cook more, the kit was a bit light but, with a local supermarket across the road, the microwave is really all you need.

But we thoroughly enjoyed our trip and our stay at the Aqua Bamboo, and fell in love with Hawaii. We had plenty of room for 3 people, and though the room was not 5 star, we didn't pay for 5 star. Absolutely everyone who worked at the Aqua Bamboo was friendly and helpful. I booked directly with the hotel. We had originally planned for 5 people & would not have expected to fit in one room in Hawaii. If you do your homework, you would realize rooms are small for more than 3 people. Our room was on the 3rd floor and faced the street, but the street noise was not a bother. We did not come to sit in a room, so a view and a perfect room was not a priorty. The beds were very clean & very comfortable. The beach was a block & a half walk and everything you could need was nearby. The pool & pool area were great.The tea & lemon water always available in the lobby was a nice treat. The only thing that I would suggest to make the stay perfect, would be to add a complimentary breakfast. Make your own waffles, cereal, fruit, coffee, juice..I usually chose hotels that offer this. It's a big help to make a vacation more affordable. I looked a lot of hotels and this would have swayed my decision.","Baltimore, MD","j193</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, MD</strong>",19,5.0

When we arrived as someone previously said we were greated very warmly, I was expected at least an ""Aloha, welcome to Hawaii type thing"" with maybe some conversation of if this was our first trip, blah blah but that didn't happen however we were checked in promptly. Room:We stayed on 8th floor facing the street and this was fine. But if you stay there and the construction is done on the pool side i would recommend a room facing that. I was really nervous coming here because of the previous two reviews about cockroaches, so when i got there i was sure to scope out our room. To my dismay I did see one cockroach under the bedside table that was dead. I called front desk and they sent someone up to get it, im really afraid of bugs so didn't want to deal with that. After seeing that I was a bit uncomfertable the rest of the days expecting to see more but thankfully we did not! The room was ok, from a quick look it looked pretty, but generally it was pretty tiny (had to get really organized to lay suitcases out because there wasn't much room). We had a small kitchentte that would have been ample to make food in the room (you can ask front desk for items like toasters, frying pans, etc.). We dirtied only a plate and knife two days and each time housekeeping cleaned those up. The bed sheets had some stains which was kind of gross, my feeling is if theres a stain that won't come out then the sheets should be tossed. There was a large closet with a safe that was nice. The balcony was ok, we didn't go out there really becasue there wasn't any chairs to sit on. We also weren't bothered by the noise from the street too much.The bathroom was also just ok. I guess in general this place looks ok on the surface until you acutally get in a room and then you start to notice the imperfections (stains here or there on walls and/or sheets, a dead bug under your nightstand, a dirty mirror, an outdated shower...). Lobby/pool area:Lounge was nice, couldn't get wifi in rooms only in lobby/ pool area. Only could get connected if you had laptop and ethernet cable. Just ask front desk right away because you need to connect to their wifi then go to a website and create a temporary account for logging onto wifi. The lobby had apples and 2 different types of refreshments (iced tea, lemon water, lemonade, etc.) each day. There was a coffee machine but it wasn't great at all. They also had a computer which seemed pretty expensive to use. The pool area was lovely. Nice lounge chairs and places to sit and eat a meal or suntan. Clean pool and little hot tub. There was a place for getting massages. The only bad thing was there was construction going on, on the balconies facing the pool so there was some noise from this from 9am - 5pm daily...it was definately not that quiet but for some reason it didn't distract me from relaxing at the pool and im pretty senstivite to noise like that...Towels/ Beach chairs:No designated spot on beach for this hotel, but they do offer towels or beach chairs at the hotel which you can bring to the beach yourself. The chairs aren't big or heavy as they aren't the full lay down ones, just little seats. The beach is so short of a walk it isn't a big deal at all like 2 blocks thats it. Service:Generally I found the men that worked there to go above and beyond to treat you well and take care of you. The women were nice but jsut didn't seem as friendly. There is luggage storage and they will even call a cab for you. Note we jsut took genearl taxis to and from the airport, a private fixed rate taxi for 30$ each way would have been our best best as taxis cost more with the amount of traffic you have to wait in. In general I think what this place really needs is a good deep cleaning with touch ups and or replacements of ratty stuff, but the location is great within easy walking to lost of shops, restaurants and the beach. I did not feel this was at all in anyway in a worse location than any other hotel on waikiki that isn't directly on the beach. This is a city so remember you will see some homeless people no matter where on waikiki you go. But the crime rate here is very low and I would not be worried about walking around here day or night really. Of course if walking in the night you employe the same caution as you would in any other city. The pool area is really nice and is enjoyable if your not wanting to get full of sand that day!Oh and FYI they have a weekly managers gathering on Thursdays from 4:30 - 5:30 pm where they ofter their signature cocktail and some light snacks for hotel guests.","Calgary, Canada","LEH85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",53,3.0

We stayed on the second floor. When we first arrived to our Hotel it was already dark out so walking around the area the hotel was at this time looked shady so it seemed like the hotel was in a shady place too as their was a guy who looked to be trying to call someone down from the apartment beside the hotel looking for drugs. But during the day it didn't seem that way. Unfortunely our view was on the side looking out into the rooms of other places of the apartment beside us. Balcony to Balcony and when there TV was on next door, you could hear it. But we never complained because we were only in that room to change, sleep as we were out at the beach or out on the town during the other times. First night we arrived though, settled in and Everything work. We took a walk around Waikiki after we checked in. Came back and some of the lights and TV were not working.. One of the workers came up and attempted to fix it but was unsuccessful. They offered us to move to another room but we had already unpacked and were tired so we said No and we would wait for the AM for someone to come again. The next morning everything worked. There was construction that started at 9am but It didn't bother us and we were out the rest of the day. Staff was friendly. No bugs noticed but they did spray the rooms anyways during our stay. The maids came early sometimes, one time at 830. But if we said We were ready to have a room right then then they would come back later as we were out. The pool was cute but stayed at the beach 6 times out of 7. Kids were always at the pool. When leaving we were catching a night flight so they kept out bags in storage and pre organized a cab for us for that evening for when we were ready to leave. Been to Hawaii twice and I am Hawaii'd out but I would stay here again if I were to return.

We arranged a last minute trip to Hawaii for our wedding anniversary, and I booked the Aqua bamboo luxury one-bedroom suite. As soon as we got up to our room it was love at first sight; you would be hard pressed to tell which has more square feet, the Lanai or the room; honestly the lanai is huge. The hotel staff, who I had advised of our wedding anniversary when I booked the room, had a bottle of chilled champagne and chocolates waiting for us on arrival; a really nice touch, and the reason we keep choosing bamboo properties. We enjoyed both on the lounge chairs of the lanai. The lanai included a BBQ grill, and enough seating for about a dozen people; it would be a great place to entertain. On the topic of entertaining, there is a small kitchenette (2 burners, microwave, small fridge) and a wet bar on the other side of the room with another fridge, stereo, TV, iPod dock, and DVD player. Across the street and one block west there is a large grocery store, where I was able to buy everything we needed for a few nights of grilling food and enjoying cold beer out on the lanai. It was truly a home away from home. Next time we go we'll have to bring some friends with us so we can make better use of the entertainment space.On the topic of construction, yes they are refurbishing the exterior and yes it is loud during the week from the hours of 9AM to 5PM. It is a good motivator to get out of the room and get moving; you didn't come to Hawaii to sleep, right? If you need to get away from the noise, the lanai is almost completely immune, so a nice cat nap in the sun will make you forget all about the construction. Other reviews mentioned roaches, we didn't see any during our stay; I saw one outside, but I'd say that doesn't count. The location of the hotel is great, right in the heart of Waikiki without being right on the strip; Kuhio Ave can get noisy at times, between street traffic and people partying on the weekends; I only noticed it during our stay on Saturday night.

I know in a tropical area its common, but the hotel we had transferred from (Ohana West: wanted a nicer room for our romantic getaway) had no signs of roaches. When we went to front desk they said they'd send someone to spray, so we went for a walk. When we came back it was obvious nobody had done anything (we had wedged a towel under the bathroom door in an attempt to barricade ourselves from roaches). I also want to mention that Raveena on front desk, as much as she was friendly at first, when we came to her with our problem she seemed apathetic and not very helpful at all. She had an attitude like it was our fault, and that we should feel bad for bringing our problem to her (I actually hesitated going to front desk because she might be there) Needless to say, I had to call again and someone came up. Then we killed many more and decided this was not a relaxing place to stay. Dan at front desk offered us the Deluxe Luxury Suite for free, but we just wanted out of the hotel. He accommodated us by sending us to the Aqua Aloha Surf where we were lucky to receive a free upgrade to a deluxe suite. Overall, it was a pretty hotel, but I can't recommend a hotel where you have to kill a roach every 10 minutes.

Stayed here 5 nights pre cruise and 4 nights post cruise. We found things very much as described by others. The location is very convenient to beach and center of Waikiki and we walked most places, The courtyard is very pleasant and has a small hot tub,4 person max to be comfortable, water temperature was hot but not too hot and the staff kept it filled or quickly responded if asked. There used to be a spa in the courtyard but it is closed and I meant to ask if the hotel was planning to use the space for something else such as a small gym room which would be a great idea. I enjoyed the ice tea, lemonade, lemon water and coffee available in the lobby plus the large bowl of apples . The staff was generally very friendly and always responded quickly to any requests. The Thursday night get together was a nice touch.We had two different rooms on the 9th floor facing the courtyard with a little view of the ocean. One of the balconies was closed in one room due to repairs but it was not the one facing the courtyard with furniture and we were gone during the day so did not hear any noise. Each room was a little different with its own good and bad points but both were very clean . There was a bit of wear on some furniture or loose plaster on some areas near air conditioner or patio door but nothing terrible. Beds in both rooms were very comfortable, sheets nice and the towels were very good. Both had single cup coffee makers with pod type grounds supplied daily. The wait between cups was a little irritating. The layouts of the two rooms were different. One had the kitchenette and desk areas in a different small room from the bed area , had a smaller bathroom counter but did have a wall cabinet which was nice. The bathroom sink seemed too small for the fixture and usually oversprayed a bit. This room had two nightstands and lamps which were appreciated. Both rooms included robes which were terry lined and a bit too warm some of the time but appreciated. The other room had the desk, kitchenette and bed all in one room. The kitchen area was nicer than the first, more counter space,larger sink and cabinets but the microwave was on a shelf which I would deem too high. The bathroom had been updated with a nice counter which extended over the toilet for storage but no separate wall cabinet. The sink in this room was a good size for the fixture which was bamboo shaped. The bed was placed right next to the lanai so access was not as easy and there was only one night stand which did not make one person happy.The sheer curtain in this room had a small hole and little tear that I noticed but this was no big deal. We could hear street noise even on the 9th floor but that was mostly sirens. I don't know if having double pane glass would help as somebody suggested but you are in the middle of a city so expect some noise. Some of the floor tiles in the hallway were cracked or missing a piece but this is an older hotel which has been pretty well maintained. We were very happy in general and would return. I have tried to be factual about this report as I felt that I had a good idea of what to expect by reading reviews and feel realistic expectations can only improve an experience.",wisconsin,"WisconsinNewtraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>wisconsin</strong>",8,4.0

At 2:30pm on the day I am flying to Hawaii I receive an email from this hotel saying they are looking forward to my stay and that I should also know that there is construction and renovations going on during the time of my stay. Too late to cancel or make changes to the reservation as I had to be at the airport in about 1 hour so this notice is WAY TOO LATE! I also received 2 previous emails from this hotel (1 when I booked room and then 2 days before my check-in time) that discussed my reservation and upcoming stay but neither one said anything about construction going on during my stay. I feel that charging your credit card 3 days before you arrive, with no possibility of cancellation, and then informing you of construction at the site on the same day you are arriving at the hotel is very deceptive and an unethical business policy.I arrive at the hotel hoping the construction will not be too disruptive as I have no chance to make other arrangements at this late time. I awake the next morning to ear-splitting jackhammer noise on the wall outside my hotel room (at least they didn't start until 9am, but I got in late so needed to sleep in a bit). This noise went on all day long and because the noise was so loud I couldn't stay in the room at all. Couldn't hear the Television even when the volume was turned up all the way. It was driving me nuts. I went down to the front desk and complained about the racket, told them it was forcing me to stay out of my room all day and then asked to speak with the Manager about having to guarantee my stay 3 days ahead but only notifying me of construction on the day I was checking in, leaving me no options whatsoever. They told me the Manager wasn't there so I asked them to have the Manager contact me as soon as possible. I never heard from the Manager during my 1.5 days at this hotel. The noise continued the next morning as well so I just checked out early and left. And please make note of what other reviewers have said in their reviews as well - the street noise at night and early in the mornings (5am garbage trucks!) is very loud and the windows/walls do nothing to keep the noise out of the room. I tried opening the sliding door to see how much louder it was with it open and while it was a little bit louder, closing the doors did very little to dampen the street noise.Overall a disastrous stay. I will never book a room at this hotel again and I will probably not book a stay at any other Aqua properties either. This kind of unethical business practice shows what poor customer service this company shows to its guests. There are many hotels in Waikiki that will do everything they can to make your stay a memorable and very positive experience. My stay at the Bamboo was memorable but there was nothing positive about it.","Seattle, Washington","John R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",35,1.0

What can I say - I like going to the beach on Christmas Day (it sure beats the cold weather on the mainland). I usually go to Waikiki every two to three years and from the reviews I read online beforehand, I decided to try the Bamboo for this recent trip. Of all the hotels I've stayed at in Waikiki over the years, this has so far been the best. I did pay a bit more this time for the room than I usually do, but it was worth it. The hotel is 2 short blocks to the beach, walking distance to everything, and the rooms are updated, compared to a number of other hotels in Waikiki. I was given a room on the 9th floor (and in Waikiki, the higher the floor, the better, due to the noise at street level). The room had an ocean view, which I wasn't expecting, due to it being behind the Hyatt. I originally figured the Hyatt would have blocked the ocean view, but I had a good ocean view on either side of the Hyatt's eastern tower. The staff were excellent on all work shifts. On Thursdays, at 4:30 PM, the hotel holds an informal gathering for interested guests, which included a couple of drinks and a magic show at poolside. For those days when you are trying to avoid the sun for a few hours, the TV channel selection is superior compared to the Ohana Hotel's limited channel selection. I had no complaints with this hotel, but only one suggestion to the owners of the hotel: please trim or remove one or two of the palm trees by the pool to allow in a bit more sunshine. There was a couple of times I didn't feel like walking to the beach, so I reclined at poolside (along with a large rum & coke, LOL). Due to the shade from the palms (and from the east tower of the Hyatt), you don't get alot of direct sunlight for extended hours at poolside. For first-timers going to Waikiki, I'd recommend this hotel, and if you are trying to save a few dollars, then consider staying at the Aqua Bamboo's neighboring hotel a block away (but definitely at this end of Waikiki due to the close proximity to the beach and amenities) and to avoid north east Waikiki due to it's distance to everything, unless you like walking. The rooms are cheaper in north west Waikiki, but I personally won't walk blocks to go to the beach anymore.","Maple Ridge, Canada","Scott U</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maple Ridge, Canada</strong>",4,5.0

We really stayed a short time, so I can't talk about the location of the hotel. Parking was just next door in another hotel's garage, but was an extra charge - $20 for 24 hours, though you could enter and exit as much as you wanted. The ambiance was as beautiful and relaxing as I had hoped, and the staff were very nice.

He called it a ""Gem"" and so do I. It was my first trip to Oahu and I was a bit overwelmed by the size of Wakikii. Hotels everywhere! Aqua Bamboo is not one of those huge hotels. It has a gorgeous private pool area, lovely rooms and it's close to everything. We were lucky and got the Penthouse Suite. We travelled with family and we each had our own private room and bathroom. Loved the Lanai! Perfect place to be for the New Year's fireworks. We were front and center! Our bed was so comfortable. There was a Sauna in the master bath! Chairs,mats or floats for the ocean? They have an area to borrow theirs for NO charge! We were a bit disappointed that the spa was closed, we were going to get mani-pedis, but, there was a great place for that right next door. Maybe they can turn the building for the spa that is next to the pool into a tiki bar.

I do recommend you get a room facing the pool, because I can imagine the ones facing Kuhio can be noisy due to the traffic and people walking by. There was a little noise in our room but nothing major. Parking is very tight and limited down in the basement, but at least it is available in case you need it.

We were on higher floors 8 & 9 which were great. We had purchased moderate rooms with no kitchenettes and were upgraded. It was perfect! clean room & a kitchen we could cook in. The hotel is in the perfect location on Kuhio and only 2 blocks from the waikiki beach, although that beach is super crowded , so go early or rent a car and go to the north shore. The staff at Bamboo was all pretty amazing especially Fe & Anthony. Our housekeeper was the sweetest Philipino lady ! There was one girl who was not great. She usually worked the night shift and she was rude to almost every customer. She also chatted on the phone to her friends or whoever almost every time we saw her. She also freaked out because we asked for earplugs one night and couldn't figure out if the hotel had them or not , when we had read that the hotel was giving them out due to the constuction. I wish i could remember her name but she has tan skin and brown hair and very unpleasant. Nobody else was like her at all. Everyone was soooooooooooo friendly and valued the true aloha spirit. We didn't hear the construction at all on the top floors and we didn't see a lot of workers. The free drinks in the lobby are a great added touch! the rooms we had all had balconys and were great. The hotel isn't totally soundproof , but if you come to Waikiki you obviously aren't coming to a place for piece & quiet. STay out of the city if you don't like noise. The pool area was awesome! cold pool , but no pools are heated in Hawaii. There are cabanas and also a grill where we grilled two nights. Yes the hotel is an older hotel , but it is well taken care of and you never hear anyone who is around you , just the traffic or the a/c unit. Perfect ! we also got to have a peek at a suite on floor nine which was BEAUTIFUL! full wrap around deck , private grill , huge soaker tub and a great view of Waikiki. This hotel is small which is exactly what we love! Great place for families or just couples.

Located just one block off the main strip, it's a perfect location. Even though it has 10 rooms on each of 12 floors, it felt like an intimate hotel. The lobby and pool were never crowded. You never waited to speak to the front desk. And the way the floors are laid out, it almost felt like each floor had only a couple of rooms. Staff was really nice. We felt very safe here. This is not a very kid-friendly hotel, so it's rather quiet and the clientele is very mature (no loud partying). We had a king bed with a kitchenette. There was plenty of room to move around (if you've been to Waikiki you know that many rooms can barely accommodate two people walking around the bed). If people are complaining and expect more, then they should go up one block to Kalakaua Avenue and pay $400/night. There are a few drawbacks: 1) The spa has closed indefinitely. Unfortunately some websites still call this the Aqua Bamboo and Spa. 2) Parking is extremely tight in the underground garage. If you rent a car, try to get a compact and make sure your parking skills are sharp. 3) The exterior of one side of the hotel is under renovation. They are jackhammering the balconeys. Our balconey was off limits the entire time we were there. Wish they'd thought to tell us this before our arrival or even when we checked in. 4) If you make any changes to your reservations, be sure to read the change confirmation emails thoroughly. They mistakenly changed our name and address after we requested a date change. It took us several calls/emails to get it corrected. And still, just days before our arrival, they sent us a confirmation email with the wrong arrival date. Despite all this, we really enjoyed our stay and recommend this to anyone.","Fayetteville, North Carolina","MeloNYello</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fayetteville, North Carolina</strong>",27,4.0

It didn't impact at all, no matter where you were in the hotel.They had laundry facilities which was good, and the pool was nice. You have the beach so the pool is big enough for the few who want to relax there. The room was modern, really nice actually just like the pictures so I was impressed. I have seen a few people have written that it was noisy, but what do you expect? If you stay in Waikiki its going to be a little noisy. My room was on the side so I still got a little street noise, I could hear buses etc driving and stopping but I still had a good nights sleep and was up early enough anyway that it didn't interrupt my sleep really. If you want something quieter stay further out of Waikiki. The room was comfortable, I relaxed some nights for a few hours and had enough food and drinks to keep me happy which i liked about having a microwave, stove and fridge so if I was hungry or thirsty i didn't have to go anywhere to get it. There was a supermarket a few blocks down which were reasonable so I stocked up on breakfast foods and lunch snacks and some dinners so I had something each day and wasn't going back and forth. Overall, I would come back here, it was cheap for the location, it had a kitchenette which was handy and was so close to the beach, like 2 blocks, bus stops and the main shopping street of Waikiki without having to go all the way to the mall.

Don't be fooled. Even though this is not a horrible hotel, they do not give any extra for that extra buck you're spending here, compared to other Aqua Hotels in Waikiki. The rooms are very small. There was not almost any place to put our suitcases, and they were just medium sized. The facade was being painted, so we could not open our veranda at all (it was locked). The personnel at the front door is just fine, but won't give you any special treatment. Besides that it charges USD 20 for the parking- the price is okay to Waikiki standards, but since the garage is for public use, doesn't matter if you're in the hotel or not, you pay the same as any other person who wants to park there, so you have no advantage on that matter.

Our room faced the unfortunate apartment block, but this didn't matter to us - the point of going to Hawaii is to see Hawaii, not to spend your time in the hotel! The short walk to the beach, shopping, restaurants and amenities and value for money made Aqua Bamboo a winner in our eyes. The pool area is lovely, though it was crowded during the day - no matter as we practically lived on the beach. We experienced some noise from the street, but it is to be expected when staying on Kuhio Ave. The decor is a little dated but very comfortable and has been modernised as best it could, but once again, we were not there to spend all our time in the hotel.

I was aware that hotel is on the busy street, Kuhio Ave, so months ahead of time I requested a Courtyard facing room on a high floor (9th or higher) letting the hotel know that I am a light sleeper. We were successfully upgraded to a Courtyard room and my request for a high-up room was noted in the system. Upon arrival, we were placed in room 410, a Courtyard away from the street with a nice view of the pool; however, our side balcony opened directly to the neighboring run-down apartment complex approximately 10 feet away and saw a guy half-naked laying in his bed watching TV. I kept the shades closed and figured it would not be a problem.After returning to our room around 7:30pm, I noticed that it was extremely loud with the apartments right next door...literally. People were smoking on their balconies, that guys was still in his bed now blaring a movie, and another person was blaring music. I tried closing the bathroom window to see if that would help but we couldn't take the constant noise so we called the front desk. The front desk lady was unsympathetic telling my wife she could do nothing about the noise and if she called over anyways they wouldn't turn down their music. My wife asked if there was anything else she could do and she said no. We asked if we could be moved to another room on a different floor and she said no, they don't have any. We asked if we could get the upgrade fee we paid for the Courtyard room and she said no, she is not authorized to do so. She said all she can do is move us to a room facing the street on the same floor. We figured it would be better than this and quieter so we agreed. We were both our pajamas so we asked if somebody could bring up the new key to us and she said no; there is nobody at the hotel that can do that...we would have to come down to the lobby and get it. So I changed, went down to the lobby and let her know I was from room 410. All she said was ""oh, here you go and said nothing else."" She acted as if she could care less about us as patrons of their business.We were moved to room 407 and upon moving our items over, I noticed that is was a 1-room suite. We were confused and not sure if we were going to get charged extra or not for being upgraded to a suite so my wife called back asking. The front desk lady condescendingly told my wife of course she is not going to charge us and that we should be happy because she was upgrading us to a room 2x better than our last room. Sadly, the room ended up being much louder because buses stop right below it and the sliding glass doors are very old and do not eliminate much, if any sound. Moreover, there is a scooter / motorcycle company right next door that blares music non-stop. I used to live in an apartment right next to a busy street and the owner put in sound-proofing windows; the Aqua Bamboo needs to do so on their lower level floors to eliminate this issue. The next morning, we spoke to the supervisor and told her of our issue. She said she could move us to a 9th floor room but after two moves we decided against it...we were tired of packing and unpacking, it is just too much of a hassle. She also waived our upgrade fee and appologized, but by then our experience of this hotel was ruined. Additionally, the pillows are flat. The comforters are non-existent, the telephones and smoke alarms appeared to be 20 years old, and the rooms are not that clean. While the day staff are nice and charming, the night staff is not. Moreover, if you are unlucky to get a room on the lower floors, you will either have a nice view of run-down apartments or hear buses your entire stay. If you are a deep sleeper or hard of hearing, this is not an issue...but being a very light sleeper, it was for me. So beware of the lower floors.On the plus side, the hotel is close to the beach, stores, and restuarants; however, I would recommend paying a bit extra and getting a hotel on or right across the streeet from the beach...it is worth it, especially with all of the new development.","Colton, California","Alton H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colton, California</strong>",14,2.0

I knew also knew that Aqua has been buying up various properties at various price points, branding them, remodeling, and calling them Aqua. Which is fine, because that means the chain has contracts with suppliers for all their little commodities, like shampoo and robes.One thing re-branding cannot change, however, is location. This hotel is on Ala Moana, the main thoroughfare, smack dab in the middle of everything. So my room the first two nights was so unbelievably loud. I stayed last year in a hotel on the 405 in LA where they were doing on ramp construction at the exit and it wasn't this loud. Plus, My room, which was quite large and comfortable, had a lanai (balcony) that overlooked the seedy apartment building next door, where the residents' cigarette smoke wafted into my room each night and made me keep the windows closed. So the first day I requested a room change and I had to spend two nights in that room (boom! scream!) and then was sent ($15 more a night - worth it!) to a full on suite (full kitchen) with a lovely view of the pool (small) and palm trees. Like a different place. Had an excellent massage at the hotel spa, (I get massages regularly -very professional and competent therapist at Bamboo.)

Not the best start to a day to have a few workmen on your balcony drilling a couple of feet from you. The only other downside for me were the floors; for some reason they have unfinished (on purpose) rocks and cement as the floor inside the hotel rooms. Other than it making us very nervous that our 1 year old would totter over and have a hard fall, it wasn't very nice underfoot for me + due to the exposed cement the soles of my feet were frequently dirty. Also our patio windows/doors were all stuck.The plus points are good though... huge and v comfortable bed, we also had a huge bathroom with a nice touch of some flowers in there too.

Great choice!Our room was on the 5th floor at the rear. We chose the 2 double bed option and it meant we had a really good sized room. (obviously you don't have to use both beds!). The Kitchen was separate and was very well fitted out and had stainless steel oven and fridge. Tea and Coffee supplies are included free. Everything was beautifully clean and well presented. We also received a bottle of champagne and chocolates on arrival. A lovely touch.The Bedroom Balcony overlooked the gorgeous pool area. An Oasis in a busy area and very relaxing & inviting,The Bathroom had a shower over the bath, toilet and vanity and was a good size. The room also had a safe which meant we could leave valuables at the hotel.The whole hotel had a comfortable, friendly feel to it and we will definitely go back there next year when we again pass through Hawaii. We've already recommended it to heaps of people.Staff are proffessional (not overwhelming you with wanting to be your best buddy at a moments aquaintance) and extrememly knowledgeable about local attractions and transport.Some previous reviewers have mentioned bugs. We didn't see a single one but that may be because we were not on the lower floors. People can forget that Hawaii is a tropical place and that there are bound to be insects of the tropical kind wherever there are people, restraurants and the like in the area. We strongly recommend you upgrade to a room on the upper floors in any hotel.What did we like best about the Hotel? Definitely the feeling of being in a tropical oasis in the middle of a big city. With regards practicalities, the Hotel location is exceptional if you want access to the Beach (it's 2 blocks from the statue of the 'Duke' on Waikiki beach). A few minutes walk to the International Market, Waikiki Market, the Food Pantry and several ABC Shops. You can also walk along the beach to a number of attractions and a closer look at Diamond Head.Ala Moana Market is a bus ride away. Take the # 8,19,20,23,24 or 42, but the bus stop is just across the road from the hotel.'The Bus' is a great way to travel. A 4 day pass costs $25 and will get you pretty much everywhere including Pearl Harbour (# 20 or 42)and a Circle trip of the Island (Go to the Ala Moana Transfer station then transfer to the #52 or 55).This Hotel is 3 1/2 star but we loved everything about it. We've stayed in dozens of 5 star hotels, but if you want to experience the real Hawaii and it's people then this is the hotel for you. Be independent and catch the bus round the island and jump on and off with your 4 day pass. It's an experience you'll never forget.","Augusta, Australia","tigerlilyoz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Augusta, Australia</strong>",36,5.0

Overall we were hardly in the hotel and the construction outside was not intrusive at all. The pool area was quiet and away from the noise of the main strip.

I really liked this place,but first things first. This isn't no mega, cookie cutter hotel on the main strip. This is a smaller, older, more personable hotel off the beaten path. And when I say older it is very tastefully renovated with it's own classy style. We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite, which I fully appreciated! The room was clean, comfortable and very nice. I really loved the feel of this place, it had the feeling of another time and place (well at least for Waikiki). The staff at the front desk was great, zero complaints at all! I would stay again at this hotel without hesitation and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice affordable hotel off the beaten path. My only negative comment would be the noise on Kuhio Ave. I would recommend getting a room opposite the street. Kuhio Ave is a noisy street! I realize the hotel has no control over the traffic, sirens, the trash trucks or the drunks yelling in the street in the middle of the night but they're there......

I reserved a Moderate Hotel Room under 'Aqua's 10th Birthday Special'. On arrival we were relieved that we were able to check in extra early at 9:30 am after a 10 hour plane ride.Big Negatives: There is construction work on the entire front of the building (facing the street). The website says ""***Beginning September 6, 2011 the hotel will be undergoing exterior improvements."" this belies the true extent of this work. Every balcony facing the street is being worked on and the entire front of the hotel is clad in scaffolding. We could not use our two balconies at all (they were untiled and being resurfaced) and we had to keep the blinds shut from 8am to 5:30pm for our privacy as there were workers going up and down on a suspended scaffold / swing stage outside our window. While the workers were working on or near our balcony the smell of the smoke from their cigarettes filtered through the air con unit and ended up in our room. We could also hear their portable radio blasting out hits and commercials while we tried to have a siesta.The bathroom stank constantly. It could have been really bad mildew but it smelled more like sewage.The air conditioning units rattled very loudly and the noise from the street could be heard clearly coming from the small air conditioning units mounted in the walls.We were sitting in our room on the first day when a Japanese couple barged in with luggage and very confused looks. I guess front desk had rented the same room out twice.A few of the light globes were broken and needed to be replaced.Positives: The pool area is new and pleasant. The actual pool is quite small (impossible to swim laps in). There is also a hot tub, deck chairs and iced tea and lemonade available for free.Free in-room internet with acceptable speed, TV was 32inch Phillips LCD with 36 channels including local and some cable channels (including Discovery) all in 4:3 aspect ratio. Room included a kitchenette with small fridge, plates, bowls, microwave, oven.The location is great, bus stop is straight across the road and it is a short direct walk to Waikiki beach.If you are planning to stay here soon you must request a room overlooking the pool (which is at the rear of the hotel) or facing the sides of the building - there was no construction work going on there. I'd guess that at the rate the work appears to be going (read: slowly) the street facing balconies could be out of action until December.For the price it was acceptable but there should have been a better warning of the major construction work going on and its effect on guests.","Sydney, Australia","Blackjack_123456</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",7,2.0

They also give you shampoo conditioner and body lotion everyday so you dont even need to bring essentials. You also dont need to bring a towel as they supply you with one in return for a towel card.The only small gripe was the refurb work was very loud in the day and we weren't aware of this when we booked.

I for one don't want that sea to extend into my hotel. Walk into most Waikiki high-rise hotels and you will likely have to bob and weave your way past hordes of tourists just to get to the elevator. You may think you have to stay far away from the action to find peace and tranquility in your lodging, but there's a wonderful alternative just blocks from everything: The Aqua Bamboo.First, the location; situated on Kuhio Avenue, it is truly a three minute walk to the beach, a major grocery store and right across the street from public transportation. It is just far enough from the action to feel like you can breathe.This review pertains to the 1 bedroom suite with kitchenette. Keep in mind your room might be different. The Bamboo is only 12 floors which is smallish by Waikiki standards, but inside you will find a collection of standard rooms and suites. Our suite (1104) is advertised at 400 square feet and feels very spacious. There is a separate area for the kitchenette that is not even visible from the sitting area or bedroom. the kitchenette contained a two burner stove, a mini fridge, and a full-size built-in microwave. Sufficient pans, dishware and utensils were provided. A single serving coffee maker seems to be standard, but to our delight we found a 12 cup coffee maker under the counter. A sliding door off the kitchen opened to a railing with no lanai, but is one of three large sliders that can provide natural light and fresh air. A small table for two completes the space. Exit the kitchen and you find a generous closet that contains a safe and robes for your use while you are there. Enter the bathroom and you see a double sink, a 3x3 foot shower, and a full-size soak tub. Gold fixtures accent the black countertop. Two people can easily move about the bathroom at the same time. Back inside the suite, you are now in the sitting room with a writing desk where there is a wired Ethernet connection. I checked it to be 1MB/s download and .33MB/s upload speeds. It is complementary during your stay. If you bring a 10 foot cable, you can surf from your bed, too. At the other end of the sitting room is a futon, which doubles as a sofa where you can sit and watch the secondary TV nestled in a nook with another mini-fridge. In our room, this nook also contained a DVD player and IPod enabled stereo system. Adjacent to the nook is sliding door number two. Impressed yet?After you get over the amenities and spacious room, you notice the floor is all done tastefully in stone. Bamboo is not just in the name, as walls and furnishings are mostly finished in real bamboo and wood. Speaking of wood, separating the sitting room from the bedroom is a gorgeous and substantial louvered folding door, which when closed provides privacy and light filtering for those afternoon naps.Moving into the bedroom, our suite had a massive four-poster king size bed supported by very realistic bamboo stalks at each corner. The entire wall behind the bed was mirrored. Two end tables surround the bed with bamboo wood lamps on each. At the end of the bed was a six-drawer dresser, large enough for longer stays. Above the dresser is your main TV, a large Visio LCD set housed in a tasteful black surround. A sitting bench gives you a place to put on your shoes or set a smaller open suitcase. I found the pillow top mattress comfortable, but the sheets didn't want to stay in place for some reason. By morning, I was untangling myself from them.About the TVs... 30 channels of basic cable are on tap, and are not in HD. You can't plug anything into the main set due to it's mounting, but the secondary TV's inputs are exposed and sport HDMI and composite inputs for your camcorder or media player. Unlike many hotels, the Bamboo has no annoying pay-per-view interface that cripples the sets own remotes. Both TVs use the same Visio remotes so you can pass them back and forth.Speaking of remotes, how about two, count em’, two identical high-tech Mitsubishi air conditioners with remotes? Too cold in bed? Raise the temp without getting up. Fan too high? Want to turn on the motorized vent deflector? All done via the remote. The one in the bedroom sits above the TV. The one in the sitting room is in the entertainment nook and cools the rest of the suite. Some rooms in the hotel may have older AC units, but these were powerful and quiet.Now it's out to your lanai. Only average in size, ours was provided with two sturdy wooden chairs and a small table for your coffee or mai-tais. Our view was to the west. The city views were stunning and fun to watch. Some miscellaneous comments...During our entire stay, I never saw one bug, only one little tiny Gecko (and I mean tiny!) out in the hall. We did see ladies of the night, but not in front of the hotel. They are all over Waikiki and are no reflection on the Bamboo or it's location, which felt nice and safe to us. After 10pm you must use your card key to enter.The two smallish elevators were fast and prompt. We never waited more than about one minute for them to arrive.The pool area is a true Mecca, and if you are not happy lounging in your room or on the beach with the free towel service, you can go out there and rest in peace and quiet on padded chairs and lounges.We loved the staff who were attentive when you needed them and unobtrusive when you didn't.Conclusion: for the price of a standard room in a big name hotel one or two blocks closer to the beach, you can have a private oasis in the middle of the frenzy that is Waikiki. It must be the Zen.","Beaverton, Oregon","sduncanae</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beaverton, Oregon</strong>",40,5.0

Aqua Bamboo is a very nice place. The front desk personnel were all very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. Great with restaurant information, although we (my daughter and I) had breakfast at Denny's every morning (ask for Tina or Mona, they were great). The property is on a busy street, however, every street in Honolulu is busy. We stayed on the fifth floor, facing Kuhio. We were about a block and a half from the ocean. Two to three blocks from Kapiolani Park, where the Zoo and the Aquarium are located. The parking area is very small. Only room for about 8 cars, so make reservation for a space early if you want to park there. I did and I'm glad I did. However there is a garage about a block away if you can't get a space. One incident that I found great. During our stay we had a power failure across Waikiki. I was washing my clothes at the time. The backup generator kicked in while the washer was running and the washer kept on running. In fact the only way I knew that out power was out was when I mentioned to the front desk that our cable wasn't working. Believe me I appreciate that generator.The back yard pool is a beautiful sight. Very nice landscaping. There is massage spa there also. We didn't use this service. In the lobby are two drink stations. One with iced tea and one with lemonade. A very nice thing to return to especially since the trade winds failed us for about three day. A morning newspaper is available by the lobby elevator as an internet connection.

But it's a seriously outstanding hotel for its star rating and price. It's very clean with nice decor. Before we arrived I emailed the staff, hoping to secure a room on the quieter side of the hotel. Not only did they give us the room, but they waived the additional fee it would have cost us for the upgrade because it was our anniversary! We arrived at the hotel early in the morning, and our room wasn't available yet, but the staff were more than happy to hold our luggage while we went exploring. When we came back, our bags were already in our room, the air conditioner was on and champagne and chocolates awaited us! It's the little things about this hotel that make it great - from the free beach towel service to the cold drinks and fruit in the foyer. The staff were friendly and helpful, happy to make phone calls to secure or confirm bookings for us, and the housekeeping staff is wonderful!

We hadn't visited Oahu for 20 years, and it was a good place to get re-acquainted with the area. The first impression when we arrived at night was that it was a bit tired and dingy, but after a good nights sleep (we turned the noisy air-conditioner off), we had a look around the place and were happy with what we found. Our room was fine - had a microwave and refrigerator. It was clean and tidy and the bed was comfortable. There was an ipod station and flat screen tv. Internet was free. The pool area made it for me. We spent quite a few hours there - just sitting in the shade winding down. They had free apples, a free newspaper and iced water or iced tea and a coffee machine in the foyer - nice touch. They don't mind you taking food to the pool area and I saw some people having a beer there, so obviously that is fine too.

The room we ended up in, 11th floor - was very lovely, luxurious and felt like a 'vacation' room - pretty bathroom fixtures, small ocean view, king bed - really lovely. The value for the price was great. I would look into staying there again, but have to say, it was because of the day crew's hospitality. There was a noticeable difference in the care/concern of the afteroon staff. I heard them talking about hotel guests, rolling their eyes when we had to get our luggage twice and just lacking the genuine smile and interest that the day team expressed. Were it not for the service of the day staff, we would not have stayed. My advice? Ask a lot of questions. If you are not happy, tell someone. If you get less than great service (we got GREAT service) - tell someone so those that are invested and care about their hotel can help you.

We arrived after a very long flight via SFO to be dealt with a lovely lovely member of staff called Fe, she advised us that we were been offered a free upgrade to the Penthouse Suite!! She let us have a good look around to make sure it suited our party of 3 and we snapped her hand off!! The PH was lovely, it was clean, well equipped, well presented and beautiful surrounding views around Waikiki.

This hotel kept coming up on Hawaiian Airlines Vacations and I was drawn to it by it's simplicity and price. However, from the initial check in to the moment I left the hotel 6 nights later, I felt like I was with old friends. The staff- everyone included, was exceptionally and most importantly to me, genuinely, nice. I may not have been with old friends, but I definitely left with new friends. I will not stay anywhere else from now on. I've stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Mandarin Oriental and felt nowhere near this comfortable. My housekeeper was truly amazing. I don't know how she did it, but she anticipated the things I liked from the smallest clues and then cleaned my room to my standards every day. (Her name was Josie, by the way.) Ray, the daytime Bellman, was extremely helpful and had the most positive approach to life that I've experienced in a very long time. Nicole, the guest services manager had the same warmth and genuineness that the rest of the staff had. She was very informative about all the hotels offerings, including the Spa. Fe, at the front desk, always had a smile on her face- and could handle any amount of guests with ease. I can't remember everyones name- but I can tell you that this was an experience that I've never had at any hotel before. I truly think that everyone was honestly happy at their jobs- which is what made the experience so good. Oh, the night staff was awesome too! I was up at all hours of the night and day, and the night staff was really nice, professional and yet relaxed at the same time. I used to travel for work and would be in hotels in Seattle, Salt Lake City, Boise, Las Vegas and various cities in California 6 days out of every week. I honestly can say out of all the dozens of hotels I've stayed at- maybe more than 50 different hotels over the years, I have not experienced this rare combination of great people and wonderful service, cleanliness, safety and fun at any hotel- ever.","Portland, Oregon","Josh W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",3,5.0

(We had only 1 night in Honolulu.) From the website photos and Trip Advisor info, we were expecting a cute, little, modern boutique hotel, and that's not really the case.The lobby is an assault on the senses - so much decoration, knick-knacks, and scents! There was an overpowering peppermint smell that had us flying through the lobby any time we had to pass through there. It wasn't necessarily a bad smell, but it was so strong, you felt like you were living inside a York Peppermint Patty. Strange. The pool was also not super appealing. We walked out there to check it out, and the hot tub was tiny, cold, and did not look like water we would want to get in.Our room was run down, and it felt like we were staying in someone's apartment. The furniture is mismatched and not in great shape - The decor looks like a bachelor's apartment who is just out of college and has been collecting friend's furniture (we even had a futon covered in a sheet in the living room.) It was just a little odd. However, it was CLEAN which is critical (except for the random Solo cup under the sink cabinet - again, reminiscent of a young guy's bachelor pad!) The window unit AC does rattle, as I read in another review.It appeared that people individually own the rooms and perhaps the hotel rents them out nightly? Like a condotel? This may be the reason for the rooms not looking nearly as good as the website. Perhaps each room looks somewhat different because of different owners?That said, the good things were: friendly staff, very affordable, clean, and very good location (walking distance to lots of great stuff.)All in all, it was just an odd little place. Not quirky fun odd, just plain odd. We would not return.

We chose this hotel due to the location, price and ratings on TA. The hotel does not include parking like many other hotels in Honolulu. We chose to park our rental in the lot next door because it was cheaper ($15 vs $20 at the hotel). The location is very central for going to the beach and also for the downtown area. You are never more than a 3 minute walk to anything. There are stores on the street, transit etc. Our experience with Aqua began a little bit bumpy due to one staff member who was very rude. We checked prices and availability before arriving and the staff member that was working the night we arrived was actually quite rude. After dealing with this young lady we decided that we would only stay the one night. We had called before hand and were told about gov't rates and CAA rates etc. and the price was good, but when we talked to the staff member in person she was being very difficult and would not give us that rate. She had told us that she has one room available for government rate (which by the way was not government rate!!). We get to our room and it is facing the traffic and is on level 2, right above the lobby. Nothing can drown out the sound. We decided that we were done with the hotel but called down to the lobby and just wanted to see if we could possibly change rooms and get the government rate. We spoke with Fe and she was amazing.We got moved to a temporary room due to a mix up and ended up with a pool view suite for 2 nights at the cheap rate. We then got moved after our room became available. The hotel itself is actually a little run down, but has all the basic things that are needed in a hotel. Washing machines, pool, coffee and juices all day for free in the lobby. They also had a pool party that was free. It included finger foods and alcoholic beverages, there was also food for purchase and the money was donated to charity. The pool was small but nice and clean, the lobby had free Wi-fi and couches all over, it also had some computer stations that you could pay to use. Parking was not free, $15(24 hrs) for next door above ground parking or in the Bamboo itself for $20 per night. Price was good, I would not pay the full-price for the pool view suite as its not amazing but it is nice if you need a full kitchen. Hotel is a little older, staff are alright if you find the nice ones. Good location about 5 min walk from beach. I will probably stay here again if the prices are the same or cheaper.

I want to start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this establishment and would highly recommend it to friends and family. The staff was courteous and helpful and made me feel at home during my stay. The staff exceeded my expectations and made my stay that much more enjoyable.With respect to location, I couldn’t have asked for a better location within my price range. In addition, I felt safe as the beach and restaurants were within close proximity. I stayed at the hotel for two weeks in mid-December and used transit daily, which was right across the street. I also took the bus to Hanauma Bay a couple of times and the transit stop was a block away.I was very pleased upon arrival to be upgraded to a lovely poolside room with all the amenities that were perfect for my stay. Since I was travelling solo, I could not afford to spend too much on a room, but was looking for a hotel that was clean and in a great location and this hotel fulfilled that requirement. I was hoping that my two-week stay would entitle me to a reduced rate, but was happy to receive an upgrade at no additional cost. The Management Reception along with entertainment was excellent. Nicole even demonstrated her talent with Hawaiian dance for all the guests to enjoy. Nicole was extremely helpful during my stay with great advice and directions.The only complaint I would have is that a couple of the families did not ask their children to remove the floating devices from the pool, which in my opinion, is very discourteous to the other guests and staff. I saw a staff member in the morning removing all the toys prior to cleaning the pool and felt sorry for him. He didn’t complain at all, but I was disappointed that the parents/children felt that is was someone else’s responsibility to pick up after them.If and when I go back to Waikiki, I would stay at this hotel again. Thank you very much for my lovely stay and I hope that you continue keep up the gold standard for service and cleanliness.Kim D.","Surrey, Canada","TravellingSolo_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Surrey, Canada</strong>",1,5.0

The management welcomed us with a small bottle of champaigne and a box of chocolates which was very much appreciated.

According to various internet sites, this was a 3 star hotel; the others were 2. We booked a studio kitchenette which turned out to be rather small. One of the others in our group booked the same room type and got a room that was easily twice the size of ours, but for the same price... We didn't spend much time in the room as we spent most of our mornings at the swimming pool and most of the afternoons on the beach, so the size wasn't too constraining. The rooms were decently appointed but were nothing fancy. The three worst things about the room were: 1) the showerhead had probably not been de-limed in a while, so the stream was neither strong nor uniform; 2) there were pockets of black mould on the bathroom ceiling and in the air conditioning unit (which was a bit gross); and 3) the in-wall air conditioning unit was incredibly loud, so much so that when the condenser switched on, it caused a vibration you could feel throughout the entire room. This made it rather challenging to maintain a continuous run of sleep during the night, particularly during the first couple of nights when we were still trying to fight the 6 hour time zone change. On the upside, the place was cheap at $129 per night; the swim meet organizers had managed to get a good deal for those of us flying in from around the world for this swim meet. Unlike some others, I didn't find the area ""seedy"" and my friends and I were not approached by prostitutes at all. My final thoughts... The staff are nice, the rooms are small, there's not a lot of attention to detail as far as cleaning goes and don't expect a good night sleep if you are a light sleeper.","Toronto, Canada","YYZErnie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",41,2.0

When my partner and I got close to the hotel, we called to inquire about where we could park. The staff member who answered the phone kept asking for our name to check our reservation and said she couldn't find my name. That was annoying because I needed to know where to park, and I thought it made more sense to talk about reservations when I actually parked and came in. She then told us that parking was full that night and we would need go to another hotel to park. Whatever, we found street parking and it worked out anyway. When we came in the hotel, she found the reservation under my partner's name and we checked in. She didn't tell us about any features or services that the hotel offers (I guess she assumed we were already fully aware), but just had us sign the necessary paperwork and handed us the key. OK... Her service wasn't bad, but it was good either, hence the title! The location was pretty good and we could walk to shops, restaurants, and the beach. The parking situation was a little stressful, but I assume that most Waikiki hotels have that issue. The room was pretty nice and comfortable. It was clean and I had no complaints on the functionality of anything in that room.

I didn't really like the internet situation as I was bound to the dresser to use my laptop.

The 1-bedroom unit with kitchenette was just right for a couple and a 14-year-old, especially because the solution to the airconditioning problem had led to my being upgraded to one of the units with a beautiful terrace with table, grill, and ""tiki hut"" where we ate breakfast during several early morning rains! We saved considerable vacation expense by cooking simple meals (kitchenette well supplied) after judicious food shopping at a local ABC store and (to save even more) at the Foodland in the Ala Moana Center where some buses between downtown Honolulu and Waikiki stop. We felt very relaxed ""at home"" that way, after busy days out and about. The inner courtyard and spa faciliities are also special--we even treated our teenage athlete to her first professional massage, which she loved-- and the hotel lends out boogie boards and beach chairs and has lemonade and ice water and even apples on offer in the beautiful, calm lobby. Other reports speak of the noise of buses on Kuhio Avenue, but we successfully muted that by requesting a unit on the upper floors and by using the airconditioning (rather than the tradewinds, which otherwise were quite cooling) when streets got noiser in the evening. Having the buses right in front of the hotel was otherwise a great advantage--a number pass frequently that go most places, and we got by fine without a car except the couple of days we explored the island. Then we parked in the public garage at the Pacific Monarch hotel immediately next door (at $15./day the parking there is cheaper than in the too-small lot under the Aqua Bamboo --just follow the instructions and park on as low a level as possible, as there's no access to an elevator or inner staircase at that parking garage for those not staying at the Pacific Monarch).The more basic units may be rather small for more than one person but I had from the beginning also for the days by myself decided that for a week-long stay it was worthwhile to find a deal on a one bedroom suite with kitchenette. Altogether what we saw and experienced was even BETTER than the beautiful pictures you can see on the website--not frequently our experience.

It was just around the corner from the beach. There are so many restaurants near by. The pool area was small but just what I needed to lay in the sun, away from the crowds at the beach, to tan and take a dip to cool off.Our room was not too big and not too small. It had a microwave and mini fridge for our lelf overs from all the great restaurants.I loved the decor of the hotel, all about the bamboo. It's was chill and zen. Our room was on the 9th floor and we could see the ocean from our room just a couple blocks away.I admit we did have some cockroches in our room but when I called down to the front desk and said ""hey I know I'm in a tropical destination but is it normal to have cockroaches in my room?"" they were quick to suggest they move us and deal with the problem. We travel a lot, so we know bugs, they need a home too but not in our room.It was just nice to see how quick they were to find and offer a solution.Distance wise, anywhere you stay in waikiki is close to everything including the beach, it's just a very small community. To give you perspective on the distance, my husband and I were at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (the hotel with the rainbow on the side of it) and we walked from there to Diamond Head, up Diamond Head and back again. People said take the bus it's so far. Uh yeh, it's not. Plus, we got to see a lot of great spots on the way and back again.We also walked from the Bamboo to the Ala Moana shopping mall. Good long walk but again, totally do-able!Take the bus back if you have many shopping bags :)Other tips, I've stayed at a few hotels in Waikiki and admit there are some real dives.

Well I just returned from our stay at the Aqua bamboo and spa and also our first Visit to Oahu and Hawaii. The first Hour on Oahu we were not too impressed, after over 6 hours in Flight 5 hour earlier time zone than what my biological time clock is used too. From the Airport to the Hotel stuck in crawling bumper to bumper traffic in our rental car to the Hotel. Is not much difference of any larger metropolitan area and could not tell at first we started our vacation on the beautiful island of Oahu. We were drained physically by the time we reached the Hotel and I recommend to any one staying in Hawaii add an extra two days to your stay for travel to and from to rest a recuperate . We pulled up in front of the Hotel and I know this is not your valet bellhop resort I did not expect someone to grab my luggage and park my car for us. We wanted a smaller low key Boutique hotel but from the reviews I did expect some type of greeting and directions. My wife stayed in the car I jump out and ran into the hotel to figure out what to do next. No Aloha or welcome to “Aqua bamboo and spa” but I had to do all the inquiry I almost felt like I was ignorant for not knowing what to do that is was expected for me to know the process. Found all the parking area was sold out for the length of my stay had to park next door , Never was offered to park out front while I unloaded our luggage and check in. We ended up having to go next door to figure out the parking actually paid a day to much. My wife and I carried our entire luggage down from the 4th level of the parking garage we were tired and worn out and at this point a little concerned about our stay. Nobody greeted us or open the door when we brought our luggage in. We are used to the Hilton chain “Garden In and suites” Homewood wood suites” on the mainland. Not you’re higher end Hilton Chain but a greeting and caring attitude we did not feel the same extended welcome impression when first arriving at this Hotel.  With all that said once we check-in and made it too our room and figured out the parking. I am thinking they upgraded our room to include a kitchenette. Our accommodations were nice and clean and the fresh flowers strategically placed throughout the room, a box of Chocolate and a bottle Champagne to help celebrate our 30 year anniversary. Although we don’t drink we appreciated the thought and effort that went with the gift of Champagne. The location of the room was good overlooking the Pool area with the tropical setting and I have to say the pool area is beautiful and kept clean and maintained daily. The bed was comfortable and room was quite except for some noise reaching us from the pool area and outside utility area side of the Hotel but nothing not expected for a Tourist Hotel area. All in all in a review I was not totally impressed but satisfied as they always say the first impression is the lasting impression. If the first moments of arrival were better with the staff presentation and help with understanding the process would have made a big impact. Living up to the expectation of the room saved the day and the location of the Hotel like the other reviews was near shopping and restaurants.  Would I recommend this hotel to others that depends on the individuals my wife I was not totally impressed we probably will not. I know this Hotel has several good reviews but if it is your first time to the Island and you do not know Honolulu area and Waikiki I would maybe plan to stay North Shore somewhere away from Honolulu and Waikiki. With the Hotel staff except for a few but it did not live up to our expectations with all the reviews. I could not even tell you any of their names like some of the other reviews did. They never ask as how our stay was going or if we needed anything or even when we left. One night I was even having problem figuring out the coffee machine “Pretty simple process just hit the button” but a staff walked right by us and never stop to ask if everything was ok’ I making it pretty vocal my frustration.

All the rooms looked tired and what appeared to be bad DIY remodelling - missing baseboards/trim, paint drips, holes sloppily cut in the cabinetry, the furniture was gouged up, etc. which would not have seemed so significant if there had not been the cockroach infestation. We had to keep our luggage zipped at all times and off the floor. We stored all food/beverages in the fridge and decided it best not to use the kitchenette at all. Housekeeping could be a little more thorough - you could see where they had not vacuumed under the beds and the shower curtain needed to be laundered.The hotel is located 2 blocks up from Kuhio Beach which was great but there was a lot of riff raff going on outside day or night, including MANY prostitutes and drug dealing at the bus stop on the corner. There were sirens every night and it was pretty hard to get any decent sleep. If I was travelling on my own this would not have been a big deal at all but I was having to herd my 13 yr old around this stuff every time we went out the lobby doors.All that being said, the staff was excellent! Everyone from the front desk to the bellman to the housekeeping was super friendly and extremely nice. The pool area was spacious and nicely decorated. The location was great in that it wasn't right in the middle of the tourist heavy spots and we were able to walk everywhere. If our destination was too far to walk, the bus stop was literally right outside. There were also many very affordable places to eat within a few minutes walking distance.All the negatives combined did not ruin our trip in the slightest bit but the cockroaches are a deal breaker and unfortunately, I would not stay at this Aqua hotel again. I had previously enjoyed staying at the Aqua Palms and had fairly high expectations about the Aqua Bamboo.","Seattle, Washington","Betty K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",8,2.0

However, after staying at this hotel for over 10 days, I don't really understand why it is rated so high. It is not a terrible hotel, but there was a bunch of little things that were bothersome which added up to me being less than satisfied. First of all, my boyfriend and I were initially given a room with two double beds and a balcony that looked over a parking lot. We asked if we could have a room with a queen size bed since we are obviously a couple. They told us it would be $15 per night and we took it. The room we received looked out onto the pool area which is much nicer. However, the sheets and towels looked dingy, the shower was not renovated, and we found two small cockroaches in our kitchenette. As far as the pool goes, it is way too cold and so no one ever goes in it. The hot tub is hilariously small. Only two or three people can fit comfortably in it. Also, they charge $20 a day to park in their garage, which is way too much considering that it is so tight. Every time we entered or left, one of us would have to get out of the car to direct the other so that we wouldn't hit the posts or other cars. Very frustrating.This hotel is okay if you want to save money. But in my opinion, I would rather spend more and have an awesome experience without the little annoyances. Last year we stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and it was amazing. Next year I will definitely stay at a newer, beachfront hotel because I think the extra money is well worth it.","Vancouver, Canada","Back2TheIsland_8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",13,3.0

I could not have been more pleased with our stay. We love Hawaii and this hotel just added to the ""Aloha Spirit""! First, I would like to say that I booked this hotel based on these trip advisor reviews, so I know how important these reviews are, not only to travelers, but businesses as well. In advance, based on comments here, I emailed the hotel and asked for a room above the 7th floor, overlooking the pool. They accommodated our request well! We were very, very pleasantly surprised when we opened our curtains on the 11th floor, room 1101 to be exact, and saw views of the Pacific Ocean and Waikiki Beach and also views of the lovely pool area from our lanai. Our room was quiet, our bed was comfortable and we were greeted with chocolates and champagne with beautiful orchids in the bathroom and with our welcome gift. It was our anniversary trip. Our first impression was awesome!The pool area is immaculate and relaxing. We sat in the pool area and used the jacuzzi in the evening after walking a lot during the day. The plants, flowers and trees are so lush and well taken care of. The walk to the beach is short and perfect for a morning or evening stroll. There are several ABC stores nearby and I felt safe walking by myself for several trips to get water or other items. Everything is within close walking distance! We went to Subway most mornings for a cheapie breakfast and there are two that we know of nearby. Our favorite value dinner was actually the other way, towards the Ali Wai canal at a place called Waikiki Sand Villa, which is a hotel. It was a bar and grill below the hotel that not a whole lot of people are aware of, but their fish and chips and Mahi Mahi over rice was absolutely delicious!! It was away from the hustle and bustle just a couple blocks over in the busy downtown area, which was nice. We were greeted upon every return to the hotel with an open door and an ""Aloha"" which just added to the feel of the hotel. This is a smaller hotel too, so the elevator was never a long wait, there was a current newspaper located right at the elevator doors every day, and the iced tea and lemon water by the pool area was fantastic and refreshing! The free internet wifi service was a major bonus as well. We were able to do a video chat with our kids back home in MN every evening before they went to bed, which we weren't able to do the last time we were in Hawaii. It made being away from the kids much easier to deal with, so we could enjoy ourselves and relax even more. The maid service was great every day as well. It's always so nice to come back to a made bed and fresh towels. Even the lotion and shampoo/conditioner was great! It smelled so nice.Some other items that we did not use but might be important to others is that they have surf boards and a few other pool/beach items that you can check out in their pool area. They also have a sauna that we did not use, and spa services in the pool area as well. We will be back to stay at this hotel. We wouldn't stay anywhere else! We don't need the fancy four and five star hotels on Waikiki Beach when we know about this hotel. It's close enough to everything and in my book it's five stars anyway! Mahalo, Aqua Bamboo!

We had read all the reviews possible & stayed ""on the fence"" about whether or not to give this place a shot. But, we did & do not regret it. We stayed at Aqua Bamboo & Spa for almost a week. We were married in Oahu while we were there. So here's the bottom line-overall Aqua Bamboo & Spa is awesome. No, it's not a 5 star hotel but if you are on a budget & weren't raised with a silver spoon in your mouth it's great. Here are some tips to make sure your stay is nice as well: Ask for a room facing the pool & above the 7th floor. We stayed on the 9th floor in 906 facing the pool & it was a little noisy still but with the a/c on at night & the bathroom door shut (window is thinner in there & noise comes thru) we were able to sleep well. The room did honestly have a bit of a musty smell (that part is true in other reviews) but it's not unbearable. If its unbearable to you, just buy a cheap air freshener from 1 of the tons of ABC stores that are in the area & you won't even notice it. Our room had 3 balconies with tile floors, 1 off the kitchenette, 1 off the bedroom & 1 off the side & the rest of our room was carpeted-bathroom was tile too. Our room was in the corner of the hotel away from the elevators so I think that helped too for noise reduction. Note-they no longer offer the free continental breakfast but they have alot of free beverages in the lobby,(the lemonade is so good!) If you are on a budget ask for a room with a kitchenette. The kitchenettes really are fully equipped with plates, silverware & cooking utensils, coffee, coffee maker & cups, glasses, pots & pans, a pitcher, a toaster, microwave, 4 burner stove top, etc. There is an in-room safe big enough to accommodate a laptap & purse, etc. (It's about 12 inches high). We didn't take our laptop so we used their internet. You swipe your credit card and it is around 20cents a minute& counts down the minutes for you so you know how much time you have used. I can honestly say those on here that have said the hotel does not look like the pictures are wrong. It does to a tee, the only thing we noticed was some of the furniture outside was a little faded. Everything else was like we were looking at the website. A must do tip- when you first arrive be sure to meet Fe. She is the front desk manager & is awesome! She goes above & beyond to make sure your stay is great. (Especially if you are a couple getting married on Oahu or a honeymooning couple ask for Fe before you leave & let her know!) My husband called before we went & mentioned we were getting married in Oahu & she is the 1 he spoke to. She had champagne, flowers & chocolates in the room upon our arrival. On our actual wedding day she tooks pics of us before we left the hotel, made a flower for my hair & when we returned our bed was decorated with beautiful flowers in the shape of a heart & there were flowers strewn all over the floor! The bouquets with our wedding coordinators package were a little pricey so we had planned on getting 1 at a florist when we arrived. We asked Fe where the nearest florist was & she told us she would make me 1! She made me a gorgeous bouquet out of white roses & pearls & gave it to me as a gift! Some of the reviews state the staff was young & acted not interested in general. Yes, they are young but we noticed that they feed off the attitudes of the guests. We had to wait in the lobby for awhile for our limo & watched several interactions with people checking in/out. Smile upon your arrival, say hi each time you walk by to leave/come back to your room & you will get the same treatment. Other tips about the area: The ABC stores are not just liquor stores, they are more like a small store that sells everything including food, clothing, etc. The food is a little high- take the city bus ($2.50 roundtrip) to Walmart. Food in Hawaii at Walmart is around $4.50 for a gallon of milk, around $3 for a dozen of eggs, about $2.50 for a loaf of bread. We asked for a kitchenette & saved a ton of money by cooking some of our own meals. The fresh fish Hawaii has it's a shame not to. There are washers&dryers for $1.50 per load@ on a few of the floors. Make sure you buy a book called ""Oahu Revealed"" by Andrew Doughty. It has honest opinions about everything from dining to hotels, etc. By the way-in the book Aqua Bamboo & Spa was called a ""real gem"". Do everything I recommended & you won't be disppointed. We did eat out a few meals (try Puka Dog & Duke's Canoe Club!) The city bus is called ""The Bus"" & is well worth the fare. The bus drivers are friendly & will tell you which bus to take. The bus literally goes almost anywhere. We even took it all the way around the island. We wanted to see how hawaiians really lived & not just what they want you to see in the tourist trap areas. It took awhile (3 or 4 hours)to go from Waikiki up the Windward side to the North Shore, then it goes down thru central Oahu right past Dole Plantation. The bus ride was alot of fun & cheaper than renting a car,(gas is around $3.80 & parking is expensive, small spaces & very limited).","Saint Louis, Missouri","Newbride020111</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",7,5.0

The room did face Kuhio Ave. which can be a little noisy at night but we do like to sleep with our windows open. There are plenty of ABC stores nearby and restaurants. The location was great for its proximity to the beach, only 2 blocks. The only negative thing was the shuttle service that the hotel uses to get to the airport was late and the operator was a little rude so you might want to make your own shuttle arrangements.

Booked the room for around $140 per night for two adults and one child, including taxes. This is an excellent rate for a hotel in Waikiki which, unlike most of the States, is quite expensive. We had booked a room with two double beds, but were upgraded to a two room suite.... queen bed in one room and twin beds in the other, a kitchenette and bathroom with shower over bath. We later discovered that this was not such a bonus, as these larger suites all front the main road and some evenings the traffic was horrendous. I would definitely stay here again, the pool and jacuzzi area is lovely if not huge, the rooms are clean and every requirement was met. No cafe/restaurant attached, but they're on every corner in Waikiki so this was no bother. It's situated directly on the major bus route, so each day we'd just walk directly across the road to catch a bus wherever we wanted to go. When staying there again I will ask for either a two room suite on one of the higher levels, or go for a smaller room overlooking the pool which we were advised was much quieter.

They only had two queens for us instead of a king, but again, it wasn't as big of a deal. The room was clean and the bathroom was pretty decent too. The view was nonexistent, the balcony overlooked an apartment building. One of the highlights was the kitchenette, it had pots, pans, fridge,etc. Useful to make a quick meal on the go.The staff was courteous, the manager inquired if we were enjoying our stay. The only problem we had with the staff was the front desk people were not very knowledgeable about local attractions and gave us wrong directions which resulted in us getting lost.The location is great, the Waikiki beach is within short walking distance.

Purchased the room on their website and got a great rate with their 60 day advanced purchase pre-pay. After you purchase on their website, they give you an option to upgrade to a higher floor for only $4 more/night if a room is available, which I chose. When we checked in we were told that the upgrade was accepted, and were given a room on the 8th floor that had a view (obstructed) of the ocean. It was a great room, with 2 balconies. Not spacious, but better than expected! The floor has a coin operated laundry, which was nice. Did not use the pool, as it was very small. But did sit out in the courtyard which is nice. The location is excellent - only one block to the beach. The location is a bit noisy, with traffic, construction and early morning garbage trucks, though I suspect that is a common problem for Waikiki. Other reviews have commented on the continental breakfast, but we were told that breakfast was discontinued as of January 1. I did experience one problem that is worth noting: we rented a car for the last 2 days and paid $20 per night to park in the hotel's garage. On our last day in Waikiki we were planning on a leisurely morning as our plane did not leave until 3 PM. We were planing on breakfast, a walk on the beach and doing some laundry, then checking out at noon (check out time). But the night before the hotel put up a sign in the elevator stating that the parking lot would close at 9:00 AM to put up a new gate - no one would be allowed in or out from 9 to 5. Since we were not planning on leaving until noon, I talked to the desk staff about an alternative place to park for 2-3 hours in the morning. The desk staff had no idea where we could park and stated that they would have to talk to the manager, who wasn't present at the time. By 9 AM the next morning the manager was still not present and I had no choice but to check out and get my car out of the parking lot. We barely got our car out, as the crew to put up the gate was already at work! This was inconvenient, as it meant that instead of a leisurely morning at the hotel, we had to rush out of the room and ended up spending the 3 extra hours waiting at the airport for our flight. I was very disappointed that the hotel had not pre-arranged alternative parking for guests (especially after paying $20 per night for parking) since installing the new gate was previously planned work! However, on a more positive note, a week after our stay the Aqua hotels e-mailed me a survey of our stay and I mentioned this problem on the survey. The immediately responded with an apology and refunded me the $40 we paid for parking for 2 nights. So I have to give them credit for trying to fix the problem, albeit after the fact.

The staff was wonderful, friendly and efficient at all times. The rooms were spotless and cleaned quickly and efficiently. They were also roomy enough for a family with teenagers to have plenty of room to manuever in. The pool area was relaxing and tranquil.

It was supposed to have been on the quiet side of the property and they gave us a room on the noisey street side, where people slept on a park bench overnight. It made me nervous and our room door did not lock properly which also made me nervous. The pool was small and crowded. Internet was not free as advertised (the catch is that it was free if you happen to have a laptop computer along with you). I had done a lot of research before deciding on this hotel, but was very disappointed and would not want to go back. It was not a good introduction to our long awaited visit to Hawaii. This hotel seemed unprofessional unreliable, and disorganized.

First, I must say that the location is great! It is within easy walking distance to all of the Waikiki hot spots. The pool and hot tub are beautiful and almost a sanctuary that doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the hotel. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The reason that I give the hotel only 3 stars is for the quality of the rooms. I didn't realize when booking that the rooms are individually owned and decorated. Our room was average, in definite need of some updating. We faced the front of the hotel and as many people mention on here, the noise from the buses is very noticeable. It wasn't something that kept me up at night, but it does take you out of that ""paradise"" mindset at times. One evening, we sat on our balcony overlooking the busy street and felt as though it might collapse at any time. I think it is time for the hotel to do a major upgrade on their rooms. The lobby and pool area are great, but are noticeably nicer than the rest of the hotel. That being said, I would consider staying at this hotel again, due to the location and affordability. I am glad that we only stayed here for 2 nights, I honestly don't think anyone needs to stay in Waikiki longer than that.

We were given a dual aspect room with views to the sea and 2 balconies which was very nice. The towels were all laid our with fresh flowers. After about 5 mins a maid came in to deliver champagne and glasses for our honeymoon treat, which was a lovely gesture. We were only staying one night before moving on to the North Shore so packed in as much as we could as soon as we arrived which involved shopping and trip to the beach before coming back to freshen up and go out again. The location of the hotel was perfect for us as it's just behind the shopping area and spitting distance to the beach so we didn't need to use our car again until we moved on. As we were up and out early the following morning we didn't take breakfast at the hotel; it looked like a basic continental and we were after something more exciting - there's plenty of choice but we ended up at the Shore Bird on the beach which had a huge buffet breakfast and did us just fine (and more!)Our room overlooked the lovely pool, jacuzzi and spa area and although we didn't use it as we wanted to get out and see the sights, there were plenty of people in there, eventhough it was raining!All in all a very pleasant stay, albeit brief but I would definitely recommend this hotel on value and location.",Cornwall,"sunset61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cornwall</strong>",7,4.0

The room we stayed in was 310. It faces the courtyard, so it is very quiet. We asked for a room with two double beds and a kitchenette, as we were two single ladies traveling together and on a budget. The room was HUGE! The main area had 2 double beds, a desk and chair, a large flat panel TV, a dresser and enough open area to fit another double bed with room to spare! The ""kitchenette"" in this room is actually a full kitchen - a separate room with a full size frig, full size stove, and a table and 2 chairs! It's stocked with dishes, glasses, silverware, pots and pans, dish soap and a towel. There is a small hallway between the bedroom area and the bathroom that has a closet on one end (with an in-room safe, ironing board and iron to use). The bathroom is small, but clean and updated. There is a curved rod for the shower curtain, so there is lots of room inside and the shower head has several settings. The only negative about the bathroom is that the new vanity is a little large for the space, and it crowds the toilet a bit. It was OK for us, but if you are a large person, it doesn't give you much room when you are seated! One surprise we found when we arrived was that this room has THREE balconies! Only the balcony off of the main room has furniture on it, but there is also a balcony off the kitchen, and one off the hallway by the bathroom. The beds are extremely comfortable, and there is an alarm clock to use. There is internet in the room if you bring your computer...if not, the computers in the lobby cost to use them, so bring your laptop. The staff is very helpful and friendly. You may get towels at the front desk to take to the beach and use. In the courtyard there is a rack with beach chairs, boogie boards, beach mats, umbrellas, and even some water noodles to take to the beach. There is no charge for this service, and they also have free amenities if you forgot your razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc. There is a continental breakfast served in the courtyard each morning, which is a couple small pastries, juice, coffee, and fruit. There is a weekly manager's cocktail get-together in the courtyard on Thursdays...they had a musician playing guitar, free appetizers and drinks, free 5-minute chair massages, and even a sketch artist! (Although I didn't use the spa during our visit, the chair massage was excellent, so I assume the spa is, too) The Bamboo is on Kuhio Avenue, one block from the main section of Waikiki Beach...directly back from the police station and the Hyatt Regency, so it is very centrally located. Traveling there all the way from Alaska, it was difficult to narrow down the hotel choices. We went to lots of online sites and spent weeks trying to decide, but we actually ended up booking through Hector at Discount Hotels Hawaii. I found his website through a review I read on trip advisor! (http://www.discounthotelshawaii.com/) He got us a great deal on the room at only $105/night. He was so nice to work with and can get the best rates at any hotel you want. He regularly visits and knows the hotels...which ones have problems, which ones are best for whatever you want to do and where you want to be. He also has the absolute BEST map of Waikiki hotels and restaurants, and there's even a map of parking in Waikiki. We didn't have a car, but the Bamboo does not have lots of parking, so that was not an issue for us. There is a bus stop right across the street from the hotel that can take you to Ala Moana shopping center or to any place on the island. There really is no need for a car. The Aqua Bamboo is a very nice, clean, friendly boutique hotel that has lots of features and won't charge you for every little thing like many places do. (Beware of the ""resort fee"" that many larger hotels charge on top of the room rate!) Our flight was late in the evening, and they stored our luggage for us so we could still spend the day at the beach and not pay for an extra night! I will definitely go back to this hotel!","Fairbanks, Alaska","AlaskaSherryJo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairbanks, Alaska</strong>",1,5.0

There's lots to see and do - we weren't really in our room all that much, it was perfectly fine to freshen up and relax at the end of a long day of shopping and sightseeing.Would definitely recommend to others, and we would stay here again when we return to Honolulu.",Australia,"Myca10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",6,4.0

But that is what my husband and I found at this pretty hotel on Kuhio Avenue in bustling Waikiki Beach. If forced to find something negative to say about the Aqua Bamboo, all we can come up with is that the pool is not very large. It is beautiful, though, surrounded by palms and bougainvillea, and there is a lovely spa at poolside where we enjoyed chatting while soaking with a newlywed couple from Australia. The hotel’s entrance is marked by a recirculating glassed-in waterfall with bamboo growing behind it. The pretty lobby welcomes the weary traveler with friendly desk clerks, fresh apples every day, and complimentary iced tea and lemon water in large urns next to the door leading out to the pool. Anthony and the other staff answered our concerns graciously and promptly. They seemed to care about our Oahu experience, and wanted us to have an enjoyable stay. Not to be missed is the Thursday evening manager’s party, where the infamous Bamboozle cocktail is served to hotel guests. When we were there, the snacks included slices of fresh banana dipped under a cascading chocolate fountain. Ono! The lobby was decorated for Christmas, and the party included live music, chair massages, and caricature sketches by a local artist. The building is older (popcorn ceilings) but well cared for, and beautifully located within easy walking distance of the beach, the International Marketplace, restaurants, Kapiolani Park and the Waikiki Aquarium. There really are too many positives to mention in a brief review. Suffice it to say that we hope to stay at the Aqua Bamboo again on our next trip to Honolulu, which hopefully will be very soon.","Whidbey Island, Washington","3Islanders</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whidbey Island, Washington</strong>",66,5.0

The pool area is also nicely appointed and a relaxing area to hang out. There is a spa on site but no other amenities such as fitness room or bar/restaurant.Our room was fine with a fairly comfortable bed - and very spacious as we actually had a separate room with a desk, a kitchen and three outdoor patios.
