Nothing wrong with the hotel. Small rooms but that is standard for Tokyo as I understand it. It’s basically a business hotel (and I have previously stayed in the brand on business) and designed to be ‘long stay’. They pack a lot into a small space and room had a (clothes) washing machine (and you are given detergent upon check-in), microwave, kettle and fridge. Comfortable bed, working wifi, decent shower, etc. There was a coffee machine in the lobby which provided drinkable coffee.Breakfast was included in our rate and fairly basic but staff kept everything topped up and, if it was empty, were happy to top up things upon request. There were a few western options including scrambled egg and bread. I’m not sure why this hotel has had so many negative reviews. We found the staff friendly and had reasonable English, were happy with the location and the facilities in the area (there is a MacDonalds next door, a convenience store across the road and several local restaurants within a couple of minutes walk! When we researched it, it seemed reasonable value and we were happy.",S Wales,"drc225</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>S Wales</strong>",318,4.0

It is about 15 to 20mins walk away from the heart of Shinjuku (and its bursting night life). So we had to walk quite a bit to the train stations (nearest was Nishi Shinjuku about 10mins walk) each time we wanted to travel (and inconvenient with luggage).The room was very small (smallest I have ever stayed) - but that was quite expected in Tokyo I guess and at that price I am not sure if you will get any larger. Bed was comfortable and service was relatively good as they left new towels outside our room when we put a DND sign.They didn't provide mineral waters (usually complimentary) and no safe deposit box. No frills hotel but just didn't cut it for us.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","davidliu14</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong>",54,2.0

But it is the most ”blah” place we’ve stayed at in Japan. The problem is, I trusted the 3-Star rating. This is definitely not 3-Star. This is comparable to a La Quinta Inn in the US. And yet it’s further away from any conveniences (subway stations, etc).The towels are so small and thin and scratchy. The tub/shower is teeny and cheap. I can see this being a nice place to stay for extended stays for business, as it has a suit press, microwave, washing machine dryer. But the room is teeny, the bed is very small, the room is so small, there is no service available.It’s very no frills and would have been fine had I known it was a 1 or 2 star. Then there would be no expectations. But when it claims to be 3-Star, I expect it to be more comfortable than what it is.

Cons:- Transferring at Shinjuku station from the subway line to the JR line is not straightforward. - McDonalds next door, but otherwise limited food options in the area. - Breakfast area was undergoing renovations at the time of stay, so had to get breakfast elsewhere. - Staff did not have great english, but we got by.

I have to say this hotel was the worst. Once I stepped into the hotel, the lobby was being renovated. The hotel itself seemed run down and needed a major upgrade. The service was horrible. I felt at the other two Tokyu Stays the front desk staff was always friendly and saying “good morning” or “hello” every time they would see us, that was not the case here. Everytime we would come thru the lobby we werent acknowledged. The cleaning ladies were friendly though. The staff also seemed annoyed at any questions we had. The coffee machine wasnt working properly in the lobby and my husband tried to use it, none of the staff bothered to help. Also, I am convinced the sheets hadnt been washed because I had a few bites on my body and was very itchy after sleeping in the bed. The hotel policy states they didnt clean rooms or fix beds for less than 1 week stay, the staff would only take out trash/replace towels, however the recyclables were never taken out! We had a whole pile we separated from the trash of plastic bottles that was never taken out during our 6 day stay here. The trash was taken out but not the bottles. I thought that was rather absurd since its part of their daily trash policy and the room was rather small (the bottles took up alot of space). The only plus to this hotel was that there were several convience stores and fast food places within walking distance. Overall, I had a poor experience at this Tokyu Stay location and will not be returning. ",,Vfab1,0,2.0

Seems to be much more busy on week days; not many people had breakfast on Saturday / Sunday so probably more business hotel. Staff is friendly and speak good English.We had a problem with washing machine and although it was late at night we did get help.Breakfast does not spoil you with choice but gives you enough variety and is really cheap so no complains there.Really good value for money.Rooms are clean, average size with electric kettle, microwave and washing machine/dryer.Remember that sheets are changed once a week and the bin is also emptied once a week but that was not a problem.Coffee machine and internet stand in a lobby.Very good location not only to explore Shinjuku and Shibuya areas but also for one day trips around Tokyo.Shinjuku station is 15/20 minutes walk away. Station is huge and not easy to navigate but be patient - after couple of days you will crack it.- Nishi-shinjuku-gochome subway station is closest (3 minutes walk) but be aware that this line (Oedo) is not one of Tokyo Metro lines. It is operated by Toei Subway which means that you can not board with Tokyo metro pass. You have to buy pass for both operators. We did usually walk 10 minutes to Nishi-shinjuku station on Marunouchi Line instead. If you have JR Pass and you don't want to spend extra money on tube tickets/pass it still can be done. There are two JR lines available in Shinjuku station: Yamanote line and Chuo line - both extremely useful. Yamanote line is a loop going to most interesting areas and Chou line will get you quickly to Tokyo station area.- Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building with free observation deck is just 10 minutes away. There are usually long queues (30 minutes wait) but staying nearby has an advantage; you can go early morning or late evening and avoid crowd.- 24/7 shop called Maruetsu Petit is 5 minutes away and is much bigger than Family Mart of 7/11; we haven't discovered it straight away but it proved to be very handy. You can find European style bread there.- if you miss international food McDonald's is in the same building and Denny's is 5 minutes away.Easy transport to/from Narita airport; JR Narita Express goes directly to Shinjuku ststion.From Shinkuku station you can catch direct trains to Kamakura, Mount Takao, Hakone and Nikko (trains to Nikko do not go often so check before travelling) so staying nearby is a big advantage.Overall very good place to stay and explore Tokyo.","London, United Kingdom","MarianW2000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",19,4.0

The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building is also 700m away - go for great views for free.

It's the first time I have stayed here, and I chose it due to a combination of location, amenities and lower cost than other options I have tried.The first thing to note is that it's a mid-range Japanese business class hotel, not a luxury place, so if you have stayed in Japanese hotels before, that should give you an idea of what to expect. If you're new to Japan, then be aware that rooms tend to be on the small side, but are well equipped with most things one needs for a comfortable stay.With that said, Tokyu Stay Nishi-Shinjuku scores highly on room layout. I stayed in a single, but as those go, I found this one to be well designed, with space at the foot of the bed for empty suitcases and other items where they were not in the way. There was also a wooden box under the bed to supplement the small wardrobe, and a good sized desk incorporating a couple of drawers and a small room safe inside. I had no trouble accommodating 2 weeks worth of clothes and stuff conveniently.My room included a washer/dryer (you get one free sachet of washing powder and after that can buy more at 30 yen apiece from the front desk), a hairdryer, alarm clock, trouser press, small fridge, air purifier, large screen TV (with CNN International as the only English channel), kettle and microwave. There was also a plate, bowl, mug and a set of cutlery including a corkscrew and good ceramic knife provided in the room.The instructions for the washing machine are not very comprehensive in English but I managed okay and it was very handy. Any handwashed clothes dried quickly over the bath due to the excellent ventilation in the bathroom.The bed was a comfortable semi-double and the pillows were better than at many other places I have stayed in. The addition of a bolster for relaxing to watch TV was very welcome. Slippers and nightshirts were also provided and changed each week.Bathroom was clean and well stocked with shampoo, conditioner, bodywash, hand soap, toothbrush and toothpaste etc. Again, some of these items could be replenished from a supply in the lobby (for free). I was provided with 2 bath and 2 hand towels plus a bath mat per week, which was absolutely fine. Water pressure and temperature was good and generally the bathroom had a decent amount of space for personal items.If you stay for short visit, the hotel provides cleaning daily. However, if your visit is longer, cleaning is weekly only as standard. This means that sheets and towels etc are changed once a week, and the bin is also emptied only once a week. I made sure to return empty PET bottles to the convenience store where I bought them to ensure my bin did not overflow. Cleaning staff were polite and friendly and did an excellent job. Desk staff told me when I checked in what days the cleaning would be done and the schedule was exactly correct. Note that if you use the in room crockery this does mean that you have to wash it yourself after use. But you can get small bottles of dishwash liquid and washing cloths/brushes from neaby supermarkets for little cost and wash them in the bathroom sink as needed. I didn't find this at all onerous.Check in was easy and fast, as I had paid in advance when I booked. Staff throughout my stay were friendly but unobtrusive and generally had a good working standard of English. The hotel was great about storing my luggage until check in on the day I arrived, and also about receiving a parcel for me in advance of my arrival.There is free wifi on every floor and I found it fast and reliable for laptop and mobile devices. There were also a good number of sockets available in the room for electronics, both on the desk and on the small shelf above the bed.Free coffee is provided in the lobby from 10am to 11pm for guests, and this was a nice touch which I used most days. Access to the hotel proper is gained with the electronic room keys which ensures that only guests can access the elevator area, which I appreciated as a single female traveller.The other thing to note about this hotel is its location. It is NOT in the middle of the busy part of Shinjuku, but rather about 15 minutes walk west of Shinjuku Station, near the border of Hatsudai and the Nakano area, close to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government buildings. The closest station is Nishi-Shinjuku Go-Chome subway station which is a couple of minutes walk away. If you do not know this area of Tokyo well, and expect to be ""in the middle of things"" or don't like the idea of having to walk any distance on a regular basis, you may be disappointed. So please bear that in mind. However, if you want somewhere that's still very convenient for Shinjuku proper, while making a bit of a saving and being a little quieter in general, it's absolutely perfect. Tokyo is a safe city to walk in at all hours in general, and I did not encounter a single problem in this regard,The location is particularly good for access to Haneda airport, as you can get to it easily from the Go-Chome subway station using the Oedo line, changing at Daimon for the Monorail., It takes about 50 minutes. I also find the Oedo line pretty useful for a lot of sightseeing once you're used to the route of the railway line - in particular, you can take it to Yoyogi and change there for the Yamanote, thus avoiding the crowds of Shinjuku Station entirely. Go-Chome station has elevators on both levels from the street to the platforms.Lastly, I found the immediate area great for pharmacies, supermarkets (there are two within easy walking distance) and convenience stores. There are also some nice little eateries nearby, both independent and chain places. I loved the Okinawan place across the road called ""Re:more"". And next door is a 24 hour MacDonalds if you are desperate for hot food in the early hours! The nearby Shinjuku Central Park is lovely for eating outdoors on a quiet day.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would happily book this hotel again.",Lancashire,"Marcia A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lancashire</strong>",51,5.0

We had a semi-double room because we booked it quite last minute and there were no twin rooms left. The room itself was very small and one of us had to open the luggage at the entrance while the other takes the space below the tv in front of the bed. There is only one small swivel chair so the other person will have to sit on the bed. The walkway to the bed from the entrance to the bed is so narrow only one person can walk through at any one time. Once the bathroom door opens outwards, the door blocks the walkway so the door needs to be closed all the time. There is no wardrobe provided. Only a bar with 5 hangers. However, I must say the room makes full use of the space efficiently. Despite its size, the room has a washing machine with dryer function, a microwave, a kitchenette with an electric stove and sink and a cabinet with a set of utensils and cutlery. The room is brand new and clean and the bathroom has a shower and tub. Check-in was quick and fuss free. Location wise, it is a 5 minute walk from Oedo subway station Nishishinjuku-chome.

There are several eateries nearby and McDonald's is just beside it. There are also quite a few convenience stores nearby so it is not quiet. The pillows are quite hard but you can request for softer ones. They change the towels and bathrobes, empty the trash and replace basic toiletries everyday.

We would definitely stay here again.The hotel is located in the quieter side of Shinjuku, about a 10-15min walk (uphill) to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building. It is about a 5min walk from the Nishi-Shinjuku Gochome station, which is 2 stops (approx. 5mins) on the Toei Oedo train line from the Shinjuku station. This station conveniently has lifts from the platform to the street, which were very useful when traveling with a stroller. The surrounding neighbourhood is quiet at night - you'll need to head to the eastern side of Shinjuku for bars and nightlife - but there are still plenty of places to eat nearby. The hotel thoughtfully provided a map with the location of nearby restaurants. There are also a number of 7-11 and 7-11 type stores and a pharmacy within 5mins walk of the hotel.We stayed in a Twin Room B room, which was large and spacious by Japanese hotel standards. There were two comfortable double beds, though the pillows took some getting used to (my husband ended up requesting a different type). Our daughter shared a bed with me at no extra charge, while the baby had his portacot (we brought our own as the hotel did not supply them). The room had a small kitchenette with a sink, small fridge (with separate freezer), microwave, electric hotplate, kettle and a combination washer/dryer (with English instructions). We found the latter to be a godsend - it was used every day of our stay. The first packet of detergent was complimentary, and subsequent packets could be purchased for 30yen each from the very friendly and helpful staff at the hotel reception. The bathroom was compact and was equiped with a shower over a small bathtub and a fancy Japanese toilet/bidet. The shower curtain was annoying but the water pressure was awesome. There was also a large flat screen tv in the room, but only one English-language channel (CNN) was available. The children however enjoyed watching the Japanese children's channel. It was possible to watch movies at an extra charge, but we didn't try this feature out.There was a small breakfast buffet costing 500yen per adult, which was served in the ground floor lounge. The options were quite simple: one type of eggs (scrambled or boiled), a rice dish, a meat dish, a soup, a salad, yoghurt and a small selection of breads/buns. It was satisfying enough, though better-value breakfast sets could be had at some of the restaurants near the hotel.One important thing to note is that for stays less than 7 days, the rooms are not cleaned daily - only the towels are replaced and the bins emptied. We were more than happy with this as the bathroom and room were spotless on arrival, and we were careful not to create too much of a mess during our stay. The cleaning staff took into account that there were four of us staying in the room and thoughtfully provided us with plenty of fresh towels each day.","Adelaide, Australia","PamNord</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",45,5.0

Overall, it's a nice place if you're looking for a quick budget solution. There's a 7/11 across the street for US tourists (ATMs that accept US debit cards). And a short walk to the major areas in Shinjuku, including the station.","Chicago, Illinois","Nelson R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",8,3.0

However, since Toei Oedo line runs in a loop, if you are coming from Shinjuku/ginza /ueno direction, you need to transfer at Tochomae station. It is an easy transfer, but it gets frustrated and tired if you are carrying luggage as well as after walking the entire day at Tokyo. Hotel location is extremely important when visiting Tokyo since you will walk a lot! This is the main reason I only gave this hotel 3 stars.The good side is that the hotel located in quiet Japanese neighborhood so that you can experience local people’s daily life. There is lovely temple called kumano shrine, which is 5mins walk from the hotel. It is local temple without tourists. It is worthy to visit. Most of items in the small drugstore besides the hotel is cheaper than those chain one in tourism spot. However, they don’t offer tax-free to foreigners.

Another reason was because we needed to do a round of washing when we checked in and the washing facilities at Sunroute were in the basement along the carpark the last time I was there (July 2014) which creeped me out so when I found this place that had a washing machine in the room, i thought we'd give it a try.Upon arriving at 1pm, we were told that check in was at 3pm. This wasn't a major problem as we were used to it but being a chain, we thought they would be a little more flexible. We left our bags with them and headed out for some food and a wander only getting back at around 9pm. They had kindly placed the bags we left with them in the room we were assigned which was a nice touch and check in was faster than them trying to locate my booking earlier in the day.Customer service was minimal at the front desk and you are lucky if someone greets you when you're walking in and out. The lobby is always empty but there's an automatic coffee machine if you're after a quick cuppa before 11pm each day.Now on to the pros and cons:ProsAs mentioned, washing machines are available in every room and they provide you with one packet of washing powder upon check in. If you need more, you can purchase it from them or from the shops close by. It is a washer/dryer combi which makes things easier as there is no room to lay your clothes out to dry. Instructions are also provided to tell you which button to push.There are bathroom amenities for you to take while waiting for the lift in the lobby (cotton buds, hair brush, shower cap, instant tea or coffee etc) so you can take what you need as and when.Toothbrushes and toiletries are provided in the room.The room is also equipped with the standard hairdryer, kettle, mini fridge, cups as well as cutlery and a microwave.The rooms are slightly bigger than your average rooms in Tokyo with a desk chair as well as an armchair and side table but also because of that, there isn't a lot of space for two to move around.The bed is slightly bigger than the standard double beds in Tokyo hotels and more of a queen size which was good.ConsThe quality of the toiletries aren't great. Especially the conditioners so ladies, you might want to buy a bottle of your own from the shops downstairs.Space wise, there really isn't heaps of space for you put your skincare and makeup etc which makes it tricky.A few power points but mainly along the desk so I'd advise you to bring a multi-plug so you can save bringing a whole bag of travel adaptors.We were staying on the third floor and I thought I'd check out if we had any sort of view only to see that we were level with the rooftop of what I think is the connecting building. Only good thing out of that is we were able to open the window for a bit during the day to air the room.The room is only cleaned once a week (every Monday) so if you stay for a week from Monday to Sunday, I doubt you'd get your room cleaned the whole time.They provide you with a 'Do Not Disturb' sign which the housekeeper ignores. On Monday, while i was changing in the room, the housekeeper happily ignored the sign and opened my room door without warning which was not a good start to my day. She later proceeded to apologies profusely but it wasn't a big deal, more an annoyance that the sign was ignored.We tried to be very conscious of our rubbish and put the plastic bottles on the side of the bin so it could be recycled when cleaned, but the housekeeper only emptied the bin and left all empty bottles and food containers we were planning to throw out untouched. The room cleaning was also oddly done with all towels replaced and additional toothbrushes when we didn't use any and they were all just sitting there in the tray but our empty tissue box was left unreplaced. So we came back to the room late at night to 10 toothbrushes and zero tissues. When you have a partner with sinuses, you know that is not ideal.The location of the hotel was also (although two stations away from Shinjuku), quite annoying because if you're taking the metro from Shinjuku, you have to transfer trains one stop away at Tochomae because it is the end of the line. It is about a 10-20 minute walk from the main area but while we were there, my partner wasn't well and it was raining quite a bit so we figured we'd take the subway.Also, if you do take the subway with your luggages and get off at Nishi Shinjuku Gochomae, I'd advise you to use the elevators as it goes straight up rather than trying to go on escalator after escalator. Once you exit the elevator, look for the golden arches of Maccas on the same side of the street on the left and the hotel is right next to it.The area around the hotel is ok with some food places open till very late but it is a residential area so the few shops in the area close around 9ish and it gets quiet. So if you're looking to stay in a vibrant area, this is not it. Maccas is 24/7 though so you'll never get hungry. There's Matsuya and Sukiya if you go past Maccas that also opens till very late (I had a meal at 1am) but not sure if they're 24/7. If you're after curry rice, CoCo Ichibanya is a few doors down from the hotel but closes at midnight.All in all, not a bad hotel but not great. Would probably not stay here again.","Perth, Australia","crunchypblover</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",18,3.0

It's also a few minutes walk from the Government Metropolitan building, which is free to go up and get a great view of the city.

We bought some delicious food from the basement of Keio at Shinjuku and heated it up back at our room and sat at our little table and relaxed with a glass of wine from the nearby 7/11 - great meal for cheap price!This hotel is perfect if you want an inexpensive place that has all the amenities and room to relax.You have to make your own bed but they give fresh towels daily and take the rubbish away.I would definitely stay here again because of the room size and location.","Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","Jennifer Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</strong>",11,5.0

We reached the hotel easily by taking the limousine bus from the airport to the Hilton Shinjuku stop and then walked 5 minutes downhill to the Nishi Shinjuku Hotel. The Shinjuku station is about a 15 minute walk away. The Tokyo metropolitan government building was a 5-10 minute walk away and offers a great view of the city. If staying at this hotel its a can't miss option and free entry. The Shinjuku nightlife was mostly on the other side of the station and therefore a 15+ minute walk away. However there were some small Japanese style pubs (restaurants really by western standards) on the same street as the hotel. Also a CoCos curry house was right on the same street plus several convenience stores such as 7 eleven. Right next door was a MacDonald's.The staff were friendly but as we had researched the area before arrival we did not rely upon them much for info. The included breakfast was basic and a mix of both western and Japanese options.The toiletries provided were plenty and in addition to what is provided in the room there are additional items that you can choose yourself from the lobby. As all the reviews indicate the rooms are very small, but this was standard across all rooms we stayed in in Japan. The semi-double has a 120cm bed and minimal space for large luggage, I suggest to pack light. There was a washing machine available in the room as well as a microwave and kettle. Most hotels in Japan had do it yourself laundry facilities so there is no need to over pack. In short, the hotel is exactly as described. It has all you need for a basic comfortable stay in Tokyo.","Basel, Switzerland","JustRose_CH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Basel, Switzerland</strong>",152,4.0

After booking our air tickets to Tokyo, we did a tremendous amount of research and finally picked this hotel because of its good reviews, proximity to Haneda airport, Shinjuku stn (15min walk) and the Gochome stn (3mins). We book two rooms over the Internet - without hassle.After some homework we found out that the best way to get there from Haneda is via the airport limousine bus. Cost is 1230/adult one-way. You need to purchase the ticket at a counter shortly after you exit the customs clearance. Then you take the lift down to level 1 and proceed to bus bay #3. Do note that the bus will take you to Hilton hotel. From there it is a 10-15min walk down a straight road (crossing 2 junctions) to the hotel. We drag our luggages and arrived there without any issues. Check in was speedy and we were given 2 rooms on the same floor. The hotel staff is really very friendly, helpful and communicated effectively in english.The rooms were surprisingly large. I have stayed in Tokyo, Osaka, Fukoka in the past and the rooms were tiny compared to this! The bathroom was also very large by japanese standards.There was free breakfast that we all enjoyed every morning. It was a small spread but they change the main dishes every day. It was good enough for us to start the day quickly and early (there's lots to see and do in Tokyo) and then catch some good Japanese food in the shinjuku or Harajuku area.They also have a washer cum dryer in every room- extremely helpful when you travel light. We did our laundry in the evenings - took about 2.5 hours and they (jeans and sweats) came out very dry. They do provide a starter pack of washing detergent enough for a single wash. You can purchase more at 30yen at the reception.Another thing to note is that the rooms are not cleaned and vacummed during our stay - it is actually stated clearly in the reservation confirmatory email. What they do is to replace all towels, and clear the rubbish. It is not the usual hotel service that you may be used to. But we are very ok with this.Our stay was very enjoyable and confortable.

It was ok. Positives...It is in a good location (by a subway station but not by Shinjuku Station - 30 min walk). There are some restaurants nearby but you will mostly be taking the train to another area or walking at least 30 minutes to the heart of Shinjuku. The hotel was clean when we arrived. It has a washing machine. This is very beneficial. There is a 24hr McDonalds downstairs. The price. This hotel was MUCH cheaper than other hotels in the area. Negatives...We were not advised when we booked the hotel that our room would not be serviced daily. No one will make the bed, change sheets or remove garbage or do a general clean. We stayed 8 days and the room was cleaned once.The staff are ok but not overly friendly and one gentleman was very rude. The breakfast is ok for travellers on a budget that are ok with toast and a small selection of pastries and soup. We only had the breakfast once. Overall I would recommend this hotel to travellers on a budget. It isn't terrible. I probably wouldn't stay here again though (at least not for an extended stay - longer than 2 nights).","Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","Alicia B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</strong>",24,3.0

Sometimes going up to reception you would find someone that doesn't speak english but they would always have someone on that does! This helped us a lot. They were always eager and willing to help out if you need anything.Technology in the rooms were all in Japanese but they have english instructions on the desk so it wasn't that hard to figure things out.The location is amazing too! just a short 2 minute walk to the subway and from there a quick 2 stop ride and you're in the heart of Shinjuku!We decided to go for a walk one afternoon and right across the road was an awesome garden/parkland - spent about an hour in there just walking around and watching the locals do there thing!

As expected, it's a very small room, reasonable for the price. The room rate, about 11500 yen per night, included a simple breakfast at the dining area near the main reception. The room is like a small apartment, with washing machine, trousers iron press, microwave, electric kettle and mini fridge. It has a T&B, a hair dryer, writing desk and a flat screen TV. The only downside is that, if you stay for 6 nights or less, no housekeeping service is provided, but they do change the towels and night robes, and empty the trash bin everyday. Location, good because it's: about 2 minutes walk from the subway station; beside a 24hr McDonalds and a couple of restaurants; and very near 3 convenience stores. It's also about 15 minutes walk from Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building. But the most I love about this hotel is the staff, very helpful and polite.","Metro Manila, Philippines","SunshineYell0w</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Metro Manila, Philippines</strong>",104,4.0

The hotel is a 15-minute walk from Shinjuku station, or a short walk downhill from nishishinjuku station. There is one station closer, but it isn't on the same line and is not worth changing for the sake of 100 metres. The room is clean and compact, but those wanting daily room service should look elsewhere as clean towels are delivered daily, but that's it. Make your own bed! The tv was good but worthless unless you speak Japanese, as there isn't even one non-Japanese channel. Wired Internet is free, but no wireless. Bathroom is small-no tub- but is clean. Breakfast was included for us, or able to be purchased for ¥500, but it really isn't very satisfying--a soup, a green salad, some hard-boiled eggs, a rice dish and a bowl of yoghurt. There are some great Japanese places nearby, a Denny's if you must, and the ever present 7-11 for coffee/yoghurt/doughnuts. Staff are helpful and speak a little English. It's a good choice in a decent location and I'd be glad to stay again.","Melbourne, Australia","rugbymug</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",54,3.0

I caught the limousine bus from the airport to the Hilton hotel, then it's a simple walk to the Tokyustay. I arrived too early to check in and left my bag with reception staff - when I returned to check in, my bags were already in the room, which I thought was a nice touch.The room is pretty small but it's functional - desk, fridge, air con, large HD television with 12 channels (all Japanese), washer/dryer, microwave, kettle. The bathroom was acceptable - not the cleanest I've seen but it was fine. The breakfast was OK - a bit of a mixed bag, as Japanese hotel breakfasts tend to be!It's in a convenient location - a few hundred yards from Nishishinjuku Gochome subway, next door to a 24-hour McDonalds for the jetlagged Westerner, also 24-hour convenience stores. There's also a park just across the road. It was always easy to navigate back to the hotel, as the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office nearby is very well signposted and easily recognisable in the skyline.I enjoyed my stay at the hotel - very reasonably priced, a pleasant room in a good location.","Aberystwyth, United Kingdom","krustysnaks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aberystwyth, United Kingdom</strong>",33,5.0

We even had a working area and a small dining area-all in one room. Pretty sure this is rare for tokyo, especially for this price. The staff were not perfect at English but they definitely tried and that counts. I don't remember seeing any English channels on their TV at all. Maybe there were. We just didn't see any.The only thing we weren't too fond of was the location. It wasn't near the Shinjuku station so there wasn't really much shopping or dining scene around.

Was very satisfied as the washing/dryer machine is in the room which makes it so convenient. THe hotel do sell washing powder for 30yen (small packet) but we opted to buy from the pharmacy nearby. There are several restaurants opened at night like Ramen shop/Izakaya/Matsuya/Sukiya/McDonalds. Matsuya is highly recommended. Very reasonable and tastes good. They serve Japanese curry/gyudon/etc. They have branches throughout Japan. The hotel provides breakfast at the lobby area for 500yen/person. Very basic menus: scrambled eggs/bacons/ham/several types of bread/soup/coffee/milk/tea. McDonald is just next door if you're bored of the menus here. The room was great but the TV location was bad. With the reflection, one might find it hard to watch TV from the bed. Other than that, it was great. The staffs are very friendly and afternoon staffs at the concierge speak English.

The price I paid was certainly good value (though not too sure what rack rate is like). It's a tiny bit further out than some places in Nishi Shinjuku.

I was very satisified and was very happy with the hotel.The location is great. I took the Airport Limosine bus to the Tokyo Hilton and then walked about 3 blocks to the hotel. There is a subway stop close by so very convenient. It is also an easy walk to Shinjuku station.What I liked is that the hotel is very new so everything is clean and modern. I was shocked at the size of my small single room. TINY. Having said that, it had everything I needed and a huge bonus was the washer/dryer. It is free to use and it takes 90 minutes for a wash/dry cyle. Even though I was only in Tokyo for a short stay I used the washer/dryer and it was a real luxury.The staff was always very friendly and helpful and gave great service. An example, when I checked in I noticed there was only one very small pillow on the bed. When I returned from dinner that night I stopped at the front desk and asked for 2 more pillows. She was very friendly and pillows were delivered within minutes.I was happy that the hotel offered a breakfast but I only did it the first morning because I didn't think it was very good and not appetizing for my tastes. There is a McDonalds directly next door and also several traditional Japanese breakfast fast-food restuarants on the same block.The next time I go to Tokyo I will for sure stay at this hotel again.

We would have to book 2 rooms, which would put us at over $400-$500. Then we found out about Tokyo Stay hotels. What a wonderful and convenient hotel chain that is. It made our stay in Japan much more affordable than we ever thought possible. We still needed 2 rooms, but we payed less than $350 for both combined. The website was very well designed, with pictures and videos of the rooms of every location available. All locations are conveniently located near subway stops, in trendy, quiet or busy neighborhoods. We picked Nishi-Shinjuku because of its location. A few blocks from the Oedo subway line and just three stops away from the Shinjuky station, that is crisscrossed by many of the city lines, including the JR line. Going to places was a breeze. To get there from the airport, we took the shuttle to the Hilton Hotel and just walked to our hotel. We did the same thing to get the shuttle back to the airport. The rooms are modern, nice and with everything you need to make your stay comfortable. We were provided with slippers, robes, shampoo, conditioner, hair driers, toothbrushes and toothpaste. There was free internet in the room and lobby, the latter also had printers available for the guests to use. We had continental breakfast included, and it was a generous one with hard boiled eggs, salad, sausage included besides the usual items in this type of menu. The hotel is small, it doesn't have all the extras of larger and pricier hotels, but we didn't come to Tokyo to stay inside anyway...And when we came back after a busy day, we could relax in a beautiful and clean room or if wanted, we could make our hot tea in the microwave provided or even do our laundry in the convenience of our room. And I haven't even mentioned the incredibly gracious staff members, who did everything we needed, even found us information on tours and restaurants nearby. We will never need to look so hard again if we go back to Tokyo.
