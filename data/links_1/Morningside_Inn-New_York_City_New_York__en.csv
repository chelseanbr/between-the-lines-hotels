I'll start by saying that the pictures are not in any way, shape or form an accurate depiction of this place. Filthy bathrooms, tiny, dirty bedrooms with doors that don't close properly, as well as other guests that appear to be using the place as a half-way house would be much closer to the truth. While we did pay less than what other places in Manhattan are charging, the price that we were charged did not give us any indication that we would be staying in a dump. I was traveling with my two daughters, and because we arrived at 3 am, we stayed until 9 the same morning. We slept in our street clothes, with a table jammed against the door and prayed that in the event of a fire, we could find our way out of the maze that is the hallway. Please do yourself a favour, and stay elsewhere. Due to the lack of accommodations in Manhattan, we ended up going to New Jersey. We definitely paid quite a bit for Uber's and PATH, but the peace of mind was worth it; we also found it to be a nice break from the chaos of Manhattan. Having stayed in the city during previous trips, I assumed that the travel time would not be worth staying anywhere else. I was wrong, and my next trip will be booked in either Brooklyn or NJ.

When I arrived, they said they were sold out of rooms with private bathrooms (which is the room that I had a confirmed reservation for). They offered me a room with a shared bathroom or a refund with an attitude as if being sold out is a natural reason not to honor my existing confirmed reservation. There was no apology or reparation. I wrote to management, but received no reply. Unless you do not mind possibly spending a night on the street, do not book this hotel! The person at the reception told me they couldn't help me but that I was free to complain. Overall, the hotel is a dump. Other aspects are just as mismanaged as the reservation system. Rooms, furniture, and toilets are in disrepair (e.g., sign says don't put toilet paper in toilet or it will clog), sheets and floors are stained, the shower walls are yellow with residue that makes you think twice whether you really need a shower.

Spend a little more for a better place. I have learn my lesson the hard way. (stubbornly learned)Keep in mind I travel to NYC roughly 6-8 times over the summer months and have given these people thousands of dollars in business. I book WAY in advance, usually in January.THE GOOD:First of all, its a great location, close to the subway, plenty of places to get food, Duane Reade around the corner. Its generally very quiet. I don't think I have ever had to wait for one of the shared a bathrooms.THE BAD:Most importantly..... YOU MAY NOT EVEN HAVE A ROOM WHEN YOU SHOW UP!!!The people who own and work at this place don't care about you, and are not helpful in any shape or form. Not helpful at all.2017: I usually book though hotels.com but for this particular trip I saw a lower price on Morningside Inns website. I go to check in and that's when the person at the desk informs me ""Oh you booked through the website, you shouldn't have done that, it doesn't work"" and ""Sorry we are full booked"" And pretty much, so what, don't let the door hit you on the way out. He didnt give a damn.You would have thought I would have learned my lesson.....2018: Labor Day weekend, after a long day I was exhausted. I go to check in at 9:30pm, this time I'm informed that the day before there was a flood on my floor, so I have no room. What?!?!? So why didn't anyone call me to tell me? Again the person at the desk really didn't seem to give a %#%. He did let me use his phone to call hotels.com since my cell phone was dying. Gee so nice of him. Luckily this time I booked through hotels.com and after hours and a lot of work they helped me get a hotel by 1am!!!!!!! This is NYC and Labor Day weekend of all times, not easy to find a room last minute (it cost me 5X as much money for this new hotel, but hotels.com reimbursed me back the extra cost, I cant tell you how relieved I was)Again, I should have learned my lesson......big time...but noooooo2019: This year I made it a point to call the day before to confirm my reservation. I called 2 weeks ago on a Friday for the following day, it was confirmed. I even asked if my other reservations were showing. Yup. Everything was fine. However when I got to my room it wasn't even cleaned. Good thing there was a spare available. (even though they claimed to be booked)Now my next trip comes. I called last Thursday I was told my reservation was confirmed an all set. Shortly after I get a call back and the girl tells me no, that my reservation had been CANCELED. And cant give me any reason why. On top of that, she had NO RECORD of my other 6 upcoming reservations!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?This year I have booked through agoda.com and they confirmed that my reservations were active and confirmed. They called Morningside Inn Several times and told me they couldn't reach any manager there and the people they did talk to at the desk were rude. (agodas words) They have tried to reach the hotel manager by phone and by e-mail, and as far as I know now (Monday Night) no one has responded to them.As I said I book well in advance to save money and to ensure I have a place to stay as NYC is such a busy place. They completely screwed me over and now its going to cost me much more money to re-book 6 more hotels for the rest of the summer.If you don't learn from my mistakes, well good luck to you. Perhaps you will get lucky and enjoy it. Or perhaps you will show up and have nowhere to stay. If you like the save money and are a gambler type..... go for it!!!",,The_Cipher02145,5,1.0

You don't need me to tell you that this is one of the cheapest places in Manhattan, almost amazingly so because it's on the elegant upper west side just a few blocks from St John of God. You probably also don't need me to tell you that in the past it got some pretty terrible reviews, which are still coming back to haunt it, because things that people write in 2007 or 2008 seem to stay permanently and rise to the top of the google page when you type in the name of the hotel. We looked at those AFTER we had booked, and, of course, had second thoughts about the whole thing... who wouldn't? Maybe that's why it's still so cheap, because a lot of people might be turned off by a negative appraisal and not even notice that it was written eight or ten years ago. What you DO need me to tell you is this: we decided, with some misgivings, to go ahead with our booking, mainly because we couldn't find anything in the area remotely near the price Morningside was charging, so we turned up, hoping for the best but prepared for the worst. And what a surprise! The people who wrote those bad reviews back then might just as well have been writing about something on another planet. Our room was spotless, the facilities very good, and the staff just wonderful to us, In fact, on leaving I asked both of them their names so that I could mention them in this review. We were so thrilled with Nina and Tanya; I doubt if you'd find anyone in any hotel who appeared to be more interested in, and delighted by, their guests. They treated us like friends, not one-night tourists. Well, the bad reviews were from a decade ago, but here's the story in 2019: my daughter has decided she is going to New York in December on her honeymoon, and the first thing I said to her when she announced this is, ""You just HAVE to go to Morningside Inn, and I will write to Nine and let her know you're coming."" I don't think I have ever said that before about ANYWHERE. I guess if a few more NEW reviews get onto google they will start to put their prices up; so my advice is, simply, don't leave it too long if, like us, you like a bargain!",Sydney,"AlanJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",7,5.0

We arrived around 10pm and were shown into a room behind the reception desk via an employees only door?? Down a narrow corridor that was cluttered with paint pots and cardboard and was full of dust. Could barely get our luggage through.The only decent thing about the room was the bed was comfortable. Other than that I have nothing positive to say. The room was dusty, the heater made a loud hissing noise every 30 mins and lasted for 5 mins (was told by staff this is normal??), TV didn’t work, bathroom was filthy - to the point where I didn’t even shower in the morning. Was woken at 6.30am by some sort of church service going on next door and then at 7.30am the guy in the room next to ours started playing ridiculously loud music and singing at the top of his voice. The lady on reception in the morning was so rude. Couldn’t have been any more obvious she didn’t want to be there. This is marketed as a hotel but I would barely call it a hostel. Even for the price (I think I paid around £60 for the night) it’s not value for money. You couldn’t pay me to stay here again, and I’m so glad it was just to sleep for the one night as if it was any longer I wouldn’t have been able to stay there.

You can walk by without noticing. Inside, you might see a group of European backpackers checking in. This hotel has an excellent UWS location for a bargain rate. Note: bathrooms are shared. I thought I was opening the bathroom door in the room, and it turned out to be the closet. =) Three or four hotel rooms share each bathroom. The bathroom has a lock: it has just one shower stall and one toilet. I never had to wait. My room was clean and quiet. It had a very nice tv and coffeemaker. If you don't mind ""tourist class,"" this is a great place to stay. There is a locked luggage room in the basement to stash your bags before check-in or after checkout. Note to Sabbath-observant Jews: all rooms have manual keys. You can stay here over shabbos and yontif.

I even thought we wouldn't have hot water considering one of the taps from the sink doesn't exist and the one that was there had a C on it.. The room só oooooohhh small! Don't get fooled by the pictures... It's nothing like in the pictures! Yes they were okay they were polite and all but.. Honestly we talked to many polite people in the city during the whole trip so it doesn't compensate the poor quality (or lack of) of the hotel.. It shouldn't even show up in TripAdvisor...,"Lisbon, Portugal","Inês A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lisbon, Portugal</strong>",11,1.0

The hotel was very basic. The elevator was so tiny and so slow. It is best to just walk up the steps. The room and bathroom are both tiny. The hotel is accessible to the red line subway station (few blocks away). It is an OK hotel for a one night stay if you intend to be out and about all day/night. When I checked-in, the front desk staff gave me a room that was not even completely cleaned. I also requested if I can extend an hour for check out and they did not allow that. Wifi stalls at night when everyone is using it.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","SouthPhillyPT19148</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",119,2.0

After driving through the night and going all day around NYC we were looking forward to getting to our ""hotel"" to relax at 2pm check-in. As soon as we walked into the building we were greeting by questionable people milling about and or yelling, and the less than friendly receptionist. We handed over the room fee of $155 in cash along with a credit card to hold as a ""safety deposit"" and we were pointed to our room with the exact words ""just go through that door over there"", an unmarked door that led to a sketch narrow and short hallway. By this point when we even opened the room to the door we were not in any surprise to what we found. The radiator appeared to have been leaking for quite some time covering a majority of the carpeted floor, the room was FREEZING because the bathroom window was open and would not close due to being broken, stains all over the sheets, walls, floors you name it, a door that barely locked and no towels or cloths to be found anywhere. So not even being in this room for 30 minutes we went back to the main desk and politely asked if a refund was possible especially since we paid the fee in cash. The receptionist's response was ""it's not very likely but you can call the manager, he isn't here right now"". After debating what to do for quite some time we decided that we would walk away from the ridiculous fee of $155 that we paid for that dump and try to find something much more clean and safer. Huge waste of money, would never recommend to anyone, unprofessional staff, hardly even a real business/hotel, will 10/10 guaranteed ruin your trip =) ",,emilysN3207QE,5,1.0
