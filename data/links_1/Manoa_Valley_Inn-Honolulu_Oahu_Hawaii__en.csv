If that doesn't appeal to you, the Manoa Valley Inn offers a pleasant and affordable alternative. It's an historic property that's an island of green in an otherwise unremarkable area two blocks from the University of Hawaii. Breakfast was excellent, and was served on a lovely terrace that's nearly overgrown with orchards and other plants. There's a garden area and pool in the back as well, though they're not well cared for. As B&B's go, Manova Valley has some shortcomings. Parking is very tight, so don't arrive in a Hummer and hog a space and a half. The room we had was nice enough and big enough for two, and it had a good bed. But the furnishings were well-worn and the shower/bath was substandard. The on-site management owns friendly dogs and they (the dogs) show up from time to time, which I personally didn't care for. The Inn is walking distance to the University but not much else, so finding good restaurants nearby where you can also park is a real challenge (and a common problem throughout Honolulu). I'm glad we chose this over the Waikiki skyscrapers, but Manoa Valley could use some attention to make it a first-rate B&B experience.",,FarAway583337,1,4.0

A sanctuary away from the brutal( not my words, a locals) high rises of Waikiki. The Inn is not a brand new glossy hotel of which you are in 1 room of hundreds but it does have a comfy bed,a/c and a wonderful substantial breakfast. it is a family home that is welcoming and a delight to return home to at the end of the day. I had a room at the top, my bathroom had a slanted roof so if you are tall maybe mention this to get an appropriate space for you. Given the time of year I visited I didn't even need the a/c as I was able to open the windows in my room for the breeze off the mountains. The staff are very friendly, polite and accommodating.

Our plane arrived late at night and had no problem having our room ready by 11PM. The view, in the morning, was quite nice, overlooking busy Waikiki and the property garden (we stayed on the 3rd floor, Davie room). Breakfast was ready by 7h30 and was very good. Fruit selection varied depending of the day and most jams were of the organic kind. Eggs and waffle were done as we like it and the croissant really good.This is an old style, 100+ year old mansion, that has kept it's charm and while many people inhabit the property, they were very accommodating. Please note that there is no elevator (no problem for us). The garden is a nice retreat if you can find the time to enjoy and the cats and dogs were very well behaved and accustomed to visitor. The few staff we encountered were very good for our special request.While there is not that many places around for diner (this is a residential area), you're never more that 5-10 minutes by car from Waikiki or any other local eatery.

We were immediately taken in by the old-style architecture, a rarity in Hawaii where wooden buildings rarely last long. The home is over a hundred years old, and has been owned by some of the more famous historical figures of Hawaiian history, which added to the ambiance.We were taken to our room on the third floor, and reveled in the view of the Waikiki Beach lights, and in the morning we saw Diamond Head Crater and the vast Pacific stretching out behind it. The air conditioning made for a pleasant sleep, as did the comfortable bed. When we woke, we had tea on the back yard deck, and had a tour of the garden as breakfast was being prepared. The garden is well maintained and full of tropical plants and fruit trees—a virtual private jungle. I was even greeted by a gecko, the first I’d ever experienced that wasn’t trying to sell car insurance.Breakfast included fresh pineapple (the best I’ve ever tasted), several buffet items (bacon!!), and made-to-order eggs and pancakes. The staff were very attentive to my need to be gluten-free, and stopped using soy sauce on almost everything for the entire week, being sure to point out which items that included it—which were few. Not once did I get a Celiac reaction, although I was careful not to order eggs after pancakes had been cooked, as they only have a small griddle for that purpose.The bathroom is sufficient, and the shower adequate. They’ve done wonders with the plumbing considering the age of the house, and I never felt wanting, but if you like your bathrooms luxurious, you may be disappointed. We certainly were not.Later in the week we cooled down in the garden pool, which is well-shaded by trees, and is deep enough for short laps if that’s your thing.The parking was free, although a little tight at times depending on the number of guests. The neighborhood was quiet and pleasant, away from the noise of the touristy places, but not so far as to be inconvenient. In fact, most places in and around Honolulu were little more than fifteen minutes away, and that’s taking into consideration the gridlock on the H1. There’s even parking on the street outside if you need it.Our room was quiet as well, and we rarely heard other guests, even when the place was full. All the guest rooms are on the second or third floor, and there are no elevators, so if you have trouble with stairs you might want to look for something else. But then you’d be missing out on the terrific art work that adorns the walls, including both paintings and sculptures, as well as the antique furniture. Most importantly, you’d be missing out on the terrific staff that made us feel like family.We were very sad to leave at the end of the week, but we will surely be back.","Coquitlam, Canada","Erik C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coquitlam, Canada</strong>",11,5.0

We didn’t see the cats except for sitting by the window, however, my cat allergies did kick in.It’s a bit odd for us westerners, lots of family, but it’s a b& b, families live on site.They share our breakfast etc etc.We arrived on an overnight flight from Sydney at 6 am, we were warmly welcomed by Mark, one of the owners.

I’m not saying this mightn’t happen in busy time but it didn’t happen to us.The breakfast after this was a bit hit and miss. Nothing you could complain about but just different.The house is 100 years old so don’t expect perfect soundproofing,you will hear the people above and below you, and then there’s the the odd quirky bits of an old house.It’s beautifully decorated in period style. The gardens are tropical and lovely. The pool cute but a bit cold for me still in April. The inn is really close to The University if that the reason you’re in town. There’s a great Japanese restaurant an easy walk away.We had the Baldwin Room,on the first floor, and there were no complaints. Huge, soft bed. Clean bathroom . There’s a lovely sitting room down the hall where you can sit, read, indulge in a glass of wine or eat a take out meal and look at the high rises of Waikiki.

The cats do not come out, but the dogs come out occasionally to common areas. The breakfast provided is fairly good. The room was otherwise clean and well maintained. It is also closely located to the main attractions but far enough to offer you a peaceful time for strolls and walks.

We rented a car which we picked up on the airport, it was very convenient and quick. The Location:The inn is located in a quiet residential area just outside of the Waikiki beach. It is definitely possible to walk down to the city center, which we did once and it took us about 30 min, but bare in mind that most of the walk was slightly downhill. We do however recommend to take a car/taxi to and from the Inn if you want to go to the beach or go for shopping. It takes approximately 10 minutes by car from the Inn to Waikiki. We quite enjoyed the location of the Inn, is super relaxing and quiet, no tourists no crowds. The room:We booked the AS Cooke room which we were super happy with, its located on the second floor and was the perfect size for 2 adults. The room is decorated in the same manner as the rest of the house, its victorian, authentic and very charming. The bed was comfortable and the air-condition was more than adequate. The room also has a separate wardrobe and a bathroom with a separate shower room. Unique détails:Don't expect a modern boutique hotel with an victorian interior! This is a historic house with genuine charm, fantastic garden and a salt water pool. The Inn keepers were super friendly but not intrusive. It really feels like your visiting someones home. A big plus for us was the 4 dogs, Peace, Donkey, Yoda and DaVinci. Super friendly, loving and happy keepers of the inn that really added an extra charm to this Inn for us. Good to know:There is free parking on the grounds. Breakfast is both a small buffet and eggs/pancakes on order. The dogs are not in public areas all of the timeThe property is placed on the national register of historic placesThe hotel is organic!Overall impression:Great! we loved it!We would definitely stay here again due to the charm of the house and the relaxing atmosphere.

It is off the beaten path, but only couple minutes from the H1 and perhaps 10 minutes from downtown Waikiki.

Our breakfast was served every morning outside the back door on a very nice veranda. That area was so quiet and tranquil which lended itself to only quiet chatter amongst the guests (library quiet)...Our hosts served a Japanese interpretation of Breakfast - that was delicious. On the first day, the bacon was steam cooked together with kale. Different but very tasty. The second day was Portuguese sausage medallions steamed with cabbage. Again, very tasty. Instead of pan seared, the potatoes were more like baked potatoes cut into quarters and covered in black pepper from a pepper grinder - delicious but different. Our hosts also offered made to order organic eggs and pancakes.Juice, Fresh fruit and pastry options were awesome; coffee and tea were great.

The inn's ownership over the past thirty years has changed a number times. It even faced possible demolition at one point though it now appears to be on a stable track of restoration and upgrade by the current owners. Most b&b and old house lovers understand that infrastructure issues like foundation, plumbing and wiring have to have a high priority in order for the structure to survive. They require heavy investment and patience. That patience likely won't extend to the average guest, hence my current classification of the Manoa Valley Inn as most appropriate for the niche B&B guest or old house lover. One exception to that is probably the couple who are looking for a romantic hideaway with distance from the hustle and bustle of today's Honolulu. Hard to quantify it, but old ornate rooms, beautiful landscaping and intimate surroundings provide a magic that many couples find intoxicating.Lots of seasoned b&b guests will know what to expect, or what not to expect from historic inns. Others, as evidenced by a number of reviewers, will start off with unrealistic expectations based on four or five star hotel properties. Resort enthusiasts should understand what to them may seem stark realities:There is no one waiting at the front door or in the main hall for your arrival. They will have to be alerted by a knock on the staff quarters door or through contact with other guests, if nearby. There is no bellman or staff to help with luggage. This is no small issue for older travelers as all of the rooms are on either the second or the third floor requiring a steep ascent up a lengthy staircase.The relatively peaceful neighborhood isn't far from Honolulu's many attractions, near the University of Hawaii campus. I wasn't too concerned about a lack of signage since I had done some detailed Google Earth searches and I knew what to expect, but not everyone will have done that.The inn's backyard is a verdant garden space of lovely tranquility. Sadly the property has been crowded by additional housing in recent decades resulting in a near total loss of the classic Waikiki / Diamond Head view from the inn's southerly facing breakfast lanai. Rooms on that side of the inn, especially on the third floor, still have that wonderful view. The garden-like surroundings of the backyard have been enhanced substantially, so the skyline of hotels may not be visible from the lanai, but the plantings and green space make for a tranquil haven. The small landscaped swimming pool in back, which was added in a more recent era, is a nice added amenity with an enticing romantic atmosphere.Now a few negatives: Breakfast was a mixed bag, heavy on vegetables and starches. The fruit was very good, but not exactly in abundant supply, especially if you arrive during the latter part of breakfast. The offer of egg OR pancake struck some in my family as decidedly less than opulent. Egg OR pancake? REALLY, at these rates? This could have been the result of a linguistic variation in the accent of our Japanese-American host staff member. Either way, the requested over-easy egg came out fried harder than the pancake would have been. One final note on breakfast: Nothing is more subjective than music and the background music played during breakfast no doubt is meant to enhance the calming, Zen-like atmosphere. We don't think they need a DJ to spin oldies for eating our egg and rice, but our family found the music more than a bit melancholy and heavy-handedly new-age-ish.Be forewarned that some family groups will pay a premium for a stay at MVI since none of the rooms can accommodate mom and dad and two grown children in their twenties. Since the inn makes no adjustment for such parties, you're looking at two full room charges which will put you over the luxury high rise rates for a room with a couple of queen beds.The two rooms we had were clean and met our basic expectations. The bedding and decor are badly in need of an upgrade. The plumbing all worked with plenty of hot water. The shower had some slow drainage issues, but was not a big problem. The classic old, still-functioning fixtures are a great reminder of times gone by. Our check-in and arrival instructions had been basic as well, leaving it to us to figure out by the second of our three nights there, that the rooms DID in fact have a form of air conditioning. The wall remotes in each bedroom controlled a wall-mounted cooler that restored comfort in short order. But you shouldn't have to figure out the controls yourself.There's always a balance at b&b's with too much or too little interaction with staff or owners. Once we had our keys, we didn't see the staff except at breakfast. We never did see the owner that I'm aware of. That would be exactly what many guests would want: near absolute seclusion with staff available if you need them. This is a big difference with a hotel concierge and room service that prospective guests need to understand.Word was that once some of the big ticket infrastructure issues were addressed, the rooms would be upgraded next. Sorry we couldn't have seen the post-improvement MVI interiors. It's heartening to think that the gorgeous Manoa Valley Inn will again shine as it once did.","McKinney, Texas","kenwalters2016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>McKinney, Texas</strong>",15,3.0

Myself & my wife first visited Manoa Valley Inn some years ago & enjoyed our visit. We decided to spend a couple of nights there during our most recent visit.On the plus side - this is a tranquil, reasonably priced Inn overlooking Waikiki & Diamond Head. It has a very zen feeling about it & a peaceful atmosphere - we found it the perfect place to spend our first couple of nights in Honolulu, recovering from jet lag after a long journey. We were not quite ready to face the hustle & bustle of Waikiki. Lovely views accompanied by a beautifully serene atmosphere is what you get here. Very pleasant staff who cannot do enough for you, breakfast included -eggs to order + fresh fruit, juices , coffee , pastries taken in the garden. On the negative side- the Inn does need some tender love & affection- wallpaper , rugs & general decor are past their sell by date. It would not take much to bring this 100 year old house back up to a five star Inn.The decor is a bit kitsch , indeed odd, in many cases. We booked the Davies room on the 3rd floor - I think this is probably one of the best with great views of Diamond Head & Waikiki. Also, we slept with the windows open - lovely, soothing breezes.I can quite understand negative reviews but if you accept that this is a quaint, 100 year old property that is decorated in a rather haphazard fashion but which is a well priced, peaceful , tranquil oasis in which to spend a couple of days then I think you will enjoy the experience",Grand Cayman,"Wayne_Cowan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grand Cayman</strong>",26,3.0

Hotels in general are quite expensive on Oahu. Manoa Valley Inn doesn't have additional parking fees, resort fees, and includes breakfast (which was quite good and free), so it's a great value once you consider all that. But be advised that this place is older. There was ongoing construction when we stayed there at the end of May, which limited parking and during the day construction workers would walk past your windows. Because of this, management gave us a discount, which was great customer service!

There wasn't any front desk to notify (there wasa sort of super's apartment, but they didn't respond to a knock on the door); no phonein the room.

It isn’t for me, but I had made the mistake of passing through Honolulu on the weekend of the city’s Marathon. My preferred lodging was booked, all room rates sky high. This inn is just above the University of Hawaii, which makes it fairly convenient by car. It is hard to find because the sign is invisible and the old house in the website photo is completely obscured now by foliage. The “Dole Suite” was a 3rd floor walk-up. The bathroom was under an eave so steep I had to take care not to bump my head standing up after using the toilet. (I am 5’2”.) There was no shower, but a generous tub (under the eave; duck to enter) with a hand-held shower hose. Which didn’t work.. There was no mirror above the sink. One bedroom was full-ceilinged; the other was sharply eaved. It would be good for a child. Both rooms had double beds (though the suite was billed as a queen) and were generously furnished with 19th-century antiques. The bedding, many throw pillows, window treatments -- everything looked as though it had been there, or elsewhere, for decades. There was no AC, but several fans, which, in December, was pleasant. The lumpy mattress, less so.All-antiques-all-the-time is really not a good formula for an inn. I love the use of well-curated antiques, but this is too much. Less really is more. Guests need to breathe new air occasionally. The owner, according to the inn’s info, is an auctioneer. He seems to have left day-to-day management to a live-in extended family.Service, or lack thereof: No one is on duty after 8 PM, and my room wasn’t touched over a 3-night stay. Parking is an issue. Street parking is highly controlled. The inn has 8 spaces and 7 rooms. I returned from dinner one night to find all 8 spaces taken. There was no one to direct me, and, if someone had a guest, no one to relocate the guest’s car. .About that breakfast: It can include brussels sprouts, gorgeous fruit, red beans and rice, or miso soup, as well as the conventional pancake, sausage and egg.

It is literally hidden away on Vancouver Drive (you'll probably miss it the first time you look for it). During our recent stay in early September, the staff was absolutely phenomenal: very sweet, nice, and accommodating. The facility itself however fell short in several areas. Our hotel room was on the third floor. There were no elevators (expected in a B&B), so be prepared to lug heavy luggage up about two flights of stairs (who travels to Hawaii with just an overnight bag?). The third floor was stifling hot at the end of the summer. Our room (Davies) had six windows: four that opened and faced downtown Waikiki with an awesome skyline view (I had to prop one up with a back scratcher that is probably still there) and two that were on opposite walls perpendicular to the other four but didn't open. Basically, there was no cross breeze; the staff gave us a portable fan, but it was hard to sleep at night and almost unbearable to relax in the room during the day. There are at least two other rooms on this floor (Dole and Dillingham); I would avoid these in the summer months (the temperature on the second floor was at least ten degrees cooler). Oh and one more thing about those four windows: they don't shut all the way (which means ""things"" can - and for us did - crawl into the room).The lack of A/C is the main factor for the two-star review, but not the only one. Our room had a very small bathroom (my wife is six feet tall and could only stand in about one-third of it as the rest of the ceiling was sloping). There was peeling paint, a very old sink with no stopper, a shelf over the toilet that was literally disintegrating, and soap that was very watery that I wouldn't use. The TV is about the size of a computer monitor and there are no individual refrigerators in rooms (though there is a sitting room on the second floor with a community fridge). That sitting room also has a window A/C unit.On the plus side, the back garden was very beautiful, breakfast was good (they will make you delicious pancakes and eggs to order), and yes, they have a pool and outdoor canopy bed that is hidden in the backyard. There is free WiFi, but we had to ask for the password and spent a night without it b/c it was too late to wake someone up for such a simple request. Parking at the B&B is there, but very, VERY tight (which makes me wonder if they ever run out of spaces when fully booked). Park diagonally- there are lines to help but very hard to see. The hot water was great and so was the water pressure. There are ""interesting"" pieces all over the main house with some amazingly beautiful antiques mixed in with dime-store kitsch. Again- the staff was great. I received an email several days prior to check-in to ask what time I would arrive and they were accommodating throughout the stay. One earlier reviewer called this ""An Old Grand Dame” - the dame however needs a trip to Home Depot, Macy's and Sephora for some modern updates. There were workers around the property on the days we stayed (so I think there are some changes coming). With some style cues (bigger TV sets and a small fridge in each room), some elbow grease and TLC (repaint the lines in the parking lot, fix the peeling paint, replace crumbling shelving, replace fading and peeling wallpaper, and adjust window screens so they shut tightly), and some renovations (replace the old sinks and how expensive can window units from a big box store cost?), I think this truly could be one of the premiere B&B bargains close to Waikiki.","Orlando, Florida","dmyrie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",8,2.0

In the evening our hosts were fine with us sitting with a glass of wine on the lanai as well, with glasses and a bottle opener provided.Other reviewers have mentioned the Manoa Valley Inn pets. The three dogs and the cat were just such sweeties! The oldest dog is 18 and a gorgeous little thing. We loved having the pets about and enjoyed their company and playing with them. However, the hosts were excellent about making sure that the animals were unobtrusive and respectful of all guests, particularly those who weren't animal people.Most of all, our hosts were lovely. Upon our arrival we were welcomed by Monica, who was just so, so helpful throughout our stay! On our first night she recommended a restaurant to eat at and made the booking for us (a nearby Japanese restaurant - absolutely amazing sashimi!), and she helped us locate any other facilities we required. Overall, all the hosts and folks who work at Manoa Valley Inn are incredibly welcoming and a pleasure to chat with.We will definitely be staying at Manoa Valley Inn on all our future trips to Oahu.

The house was decorated for Christmas and they had a beautiful great tree on the front porch I smelled/inhaled purposely every day as I came and went. The house itself is a historic structure and it is interesting just staying in a house this old on the island. The house is a little overdecorated in antiques which at times are a bit tacky but in general nice. Do to last minute scheduling, we stayed in three different rooms. The rooms were all spacious with bath attached. Beds fairly comfortable. All the old windows closed easily. No AC. At times the neighborhood could be noisy but not too bad. We just were not used to sleeping with windows opened. Third floor room we stayed in most nites had a 5 foot entrance to the bathroom and I would hit my head a bout two to three times every night despite leaving a light on. Sheets, towels nice. They do not clean the room or change anything unless you tell them at breakfast. They should at least pick up and empty trash every day and make bed. Plenty of good hot water. Breakfast was good. Eggs and pancakes made to order. Fruit was mostly pineapple and strawberries. Breakfast hot food was usually a soup, fried potatoes, greens, rice, and maybe fried spam? or bacon. The japanese (most of the residents) loved the hot food. I mostly ate eggs and croissant. Coffee was great.We did not spend much time in the yard or pool but in the first 15 minutes we were there to drop us off,my three kids got 6 mosquito bites.

A rental car is a must as it is located away from the main centers of activity (which is part of its attraction). Free, off-street parking is available although the spaces are a little tight especially when the inn is full. Our room (the Baldwin Room) was quite comfortable. Yes, the bathroom was a little old-fashioned and had its quirks - I believe reviewer Kerry Cardiff (10/26/2013) must have stayed in this room as he experienced the same problem as we did when turning off the shower. Hint to future guests: Just push in on the main shower control handle when turning it off and it will engage and shut off. Of course, they should get this fixed. As noted by other reviewers, they discourage use of the window A/C unit (they describe it as somehow ""un-Hawaiian"") but we found their location to be too noisy to sleep soundly through the night with the windows open. However, we are ""country mice"" accustomed to total silence at night, ""city mice"" would probably not find the noise level at night a problem. Monica (the owner's daughter) seems to run the place and she is delightful, hard-working, very helpful and wants every guest to be a happy one. We can attest to her strength as she single-handedly carried our two 50lb suitcases up the stairs - for which we were very grateful. I would recommend calling her on her cell phone an hour or so before your arrival so that she or someone will be there to welcome you and help check you in. The family (quite a large one) - including pets - uses part of the downstairs and this makes you feel as if you are truly their private house guests. This may be charming to some and a little too cosy for others. Breakfasts were generally well done although some of the dishes offered were unusual for breakfast. The verandah is a delightful place to sit and enjoy your coffee however seating becomes tight if the inn is full. We did not use their pool which is quite overgrown with trees and shrubs resulting in a ""grotto-like"" feel - again, charming to some and possibly off-putting to others. On balance, we felt this was a charming place to stay - we were there three nights. I feel my true rating would be 3 1/2 stars - it is definitely better than ""Average"" but has too many quirks for ""Very Good"".","Englewood, New Jersey","Nigel W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Englewood, New Jersey</strong>",82,4.0

The grounds are very well kept, and this should be a delightful oasis. There are, however, many details that need attention. Start with the toilet that won't properly flush and got frankly stinky over time, as there is no regular housekeeping, even with a stay of 5 days, as ours was. The absence of any housekeeping also meant that when we left towels to be changed (as the sign in the room indicated), they weren't, and we had to ask for toilet paper when we ran out. The sheets are ancient and pilled, and the room terminally musty. The whole house is overstuffed with tons of ""antiques"" and brick-a-brack. It just has the feel of a place that has been collecting ""stuff"" forever with little attention to style or function.Breakfast was okay, but the staff never seemed to have it fully up and running, and the toaster oven kept dying. What others have noted about space is true -- seating is an issue.The ""hostess"" is certainly not the warm and welcoming sort. This is a registered landmark, but she never offered any stories about the property and its history. No offers of advice about things to see, and I overheard rather unhelpful advice being given to others. No beach gear to borrow. No maps or restaurant guides. She is more interested in selling her organic potions than in tending to the needs of her guests.This is all stuff that can be fixed, and I hope it will be, because I'd like to be able to recommend this place to others.

It is a wonderful old house with a lot of character. It's located a block away from the university (the main reason we chose it) and very close to bus lines - so if you don't have a car, you can easily get to Waikiki, the USS Arizona Memorial, the airport, and so on. Location is great. If you want to walk a bit, there are plenty of coffee shops, restaurants, a grocery, etc about fifteen minutes' walk away.We can't vouch for the pool which is mentioned on their website because we didn't take advantage of it during our stay. The rest of the outdoor grounds are delightful. The bedrooms and bathrooms are decorated nicely, but the ""quirks"" go beyond just ""old Victorian B&B."" Shower and toilet pressure on the whole were good in the rooms we stayed in, but the (replaced from the original) truncated sink faucet (see photo) in one of the bathrooms made the hot water impossible to use - the water ran right up against the sink! There were no bathroom shades (just lacy curtains) in the bathroom, which is fine in the daytime, but really, who wants to be seen in the shower or on the toilet with the light on at night? The inn is in the city, and there isn't any air conditioning - so the noise is a problem if you want the windows open and are a light sleeper. The lack of air conditioning isn't a problem in and of itself when we stayed in January.Breakfast consisted of fresh fruit, eggs, bacon, toast, juices, coffee and tea. The breakfast area is a lovely outdoor seating area, but there are too few tables for number of rooms - so if everyone is downstairs at breakfast at the same time, it is quite a cluster.The proprietors seem nice enough, but they're a bit disorganized, and we completely agree with previous reviewers that it's actually quite difficult to reach them/get information/ask questions/communicate with them. We couldn't really tell who worked there or who was part of their family hanging out, or whatever. For example, we arrived in the evening (as communicated) and walked right past a young woman hanging out on the porch. We figured she was one of the guests as she didn't say anything. We then proceeded into the main hall of the house, with no one in sight, no bell to ring or phone to call - just a few closed doors marked private. After a few minutes of standing around we debated barging in, until the woman walked in from the porch and asked if we were guests...yes, she was the one running the show. Another complaint was that one of the nights we stayed our room wasn't made up, which also seems to be a misstep in communications with housekeeping. So, all in all, if your first priority is convenience to the university, this is a good place to stay. If it is not, we would suggest exploring other options for your stay in Honolulu.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","Simbet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",131,3.0

Breakfast is reliably great -- plenty of fresh organic fruit, bread, cheese, cereal, eggs, and there's nearly always a special hot dish like a curry or rice.

Mark and Jenna recently acquired the beautiful property; the previous owners unfortunately didn't take care of it and Mark and Jenna are working very hard to get it back to its former glory. Mark and Jenna were so warm and gracious; they are new at the innkeeping business and are working out some of the kinks but really seem to be enjoying it and are fun and interesting to talk to. Other reviewers complained about the lack of air conditioning, but it was not a problem for me. It is constantly breezy in Manoa and there are fans in the rooms if the breeze isn't enough. I even needed to put a blanket on my bed a couple of nights because I got chilly. Things I loved: 1 - location. Manoa is a great place to stay if you're not into touristy Waikiki. The University of Hawaii is half a block away, and I really enjoyed taking evening jogs back into the beautiful neighborhoods of Manoa Valley. 2 - the property. The GORGEOUS swimming grotto is fabulous. I swam there nearly every night. It has a lovely waterfall at one end and is surrounded by flowering bushes, which makes it very private. There is also a great view of Diamond Head and Waikiki from the expansive back porch, where they serve breakfast. The yard is lush and Jenna is putting in an organic garden. 3 - Mark and Jenna's generosity. One night as I was heading to an event, Jenna picked a hibiscus from the garden for me to wear in my hair. I often had early morning meetings and had to miss the big breakfast they put out, so Mark asked me what I wanted to eat (cereal) and then went out and bought the kind of cereal I wanted. When I was around for breakfast on the weekends, there were several options (always including fresh fruit) and they would also make eggs to order. Things that still need work: the maid service is inconsistent. It wasn't explained to me when I arrived, so I didn't realize I needed to leave my key for the maid to service the room. Once or twice when I did leave my key, they still didn't clean the room. Once I was also disturbed by a worker (M&J employ 2 workers 7 days a week on restoring and fixing up the property) who was out working on the roof near my bedroom at an early hour (they're putting in solar panels). It's important for potential guests to realize that Mark and Jenna do have 4 dogs who often hang out on the back porch and in the entryway. If you don't like dogs this is not the place for you. Bottom line: The property is beautiful and Mark and Jenna are very nice, and overall it has a casual/laid-back vibe that I think reflects Hawaii.","New York City, New York","MKD73</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",2,4.0

Still, I've stayed in some pretty Bohemian B&Bs and there were enough positive comments to make me think things were improving at the Manoa Valley Inn. They are. Mark and Jena have been working since the beginning of the year and there is a lot to do. (e.g. Big old house, lots of formerly untended gardens, and owners with day jobs). Our stay was very enjoyable and we will come back again. Having said that, you need to know what kind of traveler you are. This is not a pristine B&B with little soaps, vases of flowers in the room, and lots of amenities. But, whatever you want or need, (a knife, cutting board, hot water for tea) is available for the asking. And I loved that the breakfasts were a combination of American standard fare (eggs, yogurt, oatmeal) and some mornings Miso Soup, stir Fried Veggies, and curry to spead on bread like peanut butter. So, if you're the type of visitor who isn't adventurous, doesn't like dogs (they are there but controlled) or expects a pristine place with no surprises, this is not the place for you. It was not musty, did not smell of dog, and it was clean. Yes the towels are old and if you fill your waste basket you'll need to actually carry the bag to the first floor, but I think that's the charm of staying in a cool old place where you get to know the owners. So, if you have a bit of the Bohemian in you, love old houses, old furniture, and interesting people, you'll love staying here as much as my husband and I did.The salt water pool is heaven. And they have a water filtration system that makes their tap water taste like water from heaven. I hated to leave that behind. We stayed in the Guild Room and the shower is awesome! You can exfoliate the tan right off yourself if you want. Lots of hot water with a powerful big round shower head.The view of the nighttime skyline of Oahu is breathtaking. It looks like a long diamond necklace. And you can see Diamond Head too.You're near the college, so the bus line runs close and restaurants are within walking distance.Most of all, Mark and Jena were fantastic hosts. Mark runs an auction company, so he keeps filling the house with cool antique finds. Jena runs a spa and is the chief gardener at the house. She is working hard to revive the beautiful plants that were neglected by the previous owner. There are lots of birds and beautiful flowers everywhere.And I loved the dogs. Especially Tin Tin, who lay down on my feet when it was time for me to go. Not creepy, not dark, not dirty. Oh, and one of the old dogs does have a diaper, but this is so he doesn't lift his leg in the house. Well, he does lift his leg in the house, but he's wearing a diaper, so it's okay. He's very old and blind. Give the guy a break. And he doesn't smell. None of them do.The complainers need to stay at the beach hotels.Aloha Manoa Valley Inn.

When we arrived in January 2012 we found that the guild suite was actually two separate rooms, each with a bath which was wonderful, but the website could list it more accurately so you know what to expect. The website does say that daily maid service is not provided, but we stayed 5 days and emptying of the trash would have been nice. The location near University of Hawaii was very convenient to Waikiki, Pearl Harbor and there are lots of restaurants nearby. The breakfast consisted of coffee, bread for toasting, fresh fruit, juice. One day there were cold cuts (which was odd for breakfast) but we did make a sandwich for lunch during the day. I'm a diabetic, so something beside juice and carbs would have been nice and real cream would have been awesome. There were no ""extras"" - no shampoo, no soap. There were many times during the day when there was not a soul in the Inn and other times when the construction was so loud that a nap was not an option. The high point of the Inn is the pool. It is a salt water oasis that is even lovier than the pictures ... and the outdoor canopy bed is heaven! The backyard is a lush garden paradise and the nighttime view of the lights of Waikiki is spectacular. This historic Victorian Inn is not in the best shape and the owners are restoring it, hopefully to it's original glory. More attention needs to be paid to the customers. We got home late one evening and the and it was so dark we had to use our cell phones to be able to open the door. It was creepy walking in with no lights whatsoever. Then later that night the caretaker kept coming in and out the front door at all hours of the morning letting the door bang each time. I do not agree with the other reviews that the inn was moldy and dirty, but it is old so if you are expecting pristine, this is not the place for you.

No less then 4 greeted us, one in diapers (get the picture/smell). That was all that greeted us. It took several calls from outside the premises to get someone to greet us, show us the room, give us keys. We should have run at that point, but it was late afternoon and we were beat.My husband & I were on Oahu for business and thought the Inn looked appealing and out of the Waikiki hustle bustle. We had booked two nights. We stomached one night. I knew we were in trouble when my husband said he was keeping his shoes on (he hates shoes). When we left the next morning, not wanting to make a scene, we said we had an emergency and needed to leave a day early. A ""so what"" attitude was given and no mention of a refund for the second night (they make you pay at time of booking with credit card). We didn't care. We booked a night at the Hawaii Prince Hotel for the same price and quickly removed our self from the Inn. It was so worth the forfeiture of the second night.Not sure where the ""excellent reviewers"" stayed, but be assured, it was not here!!

Six of us (all adults) arrived on Christmas Eve, and we were initially disappointed by the lack of a greeter and the signs of chaos in some side rooms. We learned the inn had literally just been purchased and the old owner had vacated but a day or two before. Someone finally showed up to put us in our rooms and by the time we returned from dinner, the owner was there. Mark Gwen and his wife Jena plan to live on the property after they remoded their quarters. A lot of construction and general fixing-up went on the whole time we were there, but it wasn't bothersome to us as we were gone most days. Every single day, something wonderful happened while we were gone to transform the place. The continental breakfast on the porch was yummy, and they allowed us to bring our wine and cheese to the same porch in the evenings to watch the sparkling Honolulu skyline illuminate as the sun set. Mark was friendly and helpful; the home is beautiful; rates were great and we had a wonderful 7 night stay.The magnificent firework display was visible on New Year's Eve from the porch!

Plus, I used to live in Waialua and Kaneohe, and so was looking forward to coming back to a neighborhood. Ok, so here's the bad: - The people are strange. They don't seem like B&B people (read: not friendly). They have walled off the lower portion of the house for their own use. I understand doing that for some of the house, but when you walk down the stairway, you have nowhere to go but outside (where they want you, is my guess) because the doors to the left and right are closed. This alone makes this B&B untenable, in my view: there's no real common space to play games, meet other people, etc. The semi-good: - The house is nice, and the backyard, where they have breakfast, is quite pleasant. In sum: nice neighborhood (except for screaming neighbors at one point in the middle of the night), old but beautiful house, but the vibe from theplace is so negative I'd never stay here again.",emoo217,"emoo217</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>emoo217</strong>",12,2.0

We wanted something different yet special, romantic yet secluded from the city life surrounding us. This was a true find of all the many options available to us in Waikiki, North Shore & Makaha areas; we thought this was the best of all. It has such a surprise to it. Once you arrive you enter a world of the past with historic atmosphere & Hawaiian pictures & various touches throughout the inside & outside gardens, lanai, & views. It is so breathtaking to look out at this marvelous view & knowing that the city life is just a block away, but you cannot hear it!!! Then we were able to enjoy the pleasant welcome of the co-owner & were settled into our room, had some refreshment, a beautiful heated salt-water swim prior to our going out for dinner. The pool is nestled in a tropical ambiance of seclusion & beauty. It was very romantic & still remained in wonder at knowing the city was so close by, but felt as if we were in a mountain pool by ourselves. AMAZING!! We were able to return in the evening & go for another swim which was again so breathtakingly sweet & peaceful with romance in the air. The room we were given was so beautifully decorated, which gave it the feel of being in your own home bedroom, but nicer in that you don't have to do the clean-up. We were provided with breakfast on the lanai in the AM & then the option of roaming the garden area in back with foliage & flowers everywhere. We were thrilled & knew we made a most terrific find in this one night stay. We plan to recommend this to anyone who wants a VERY SPECIAL PLACE whether it be for a short stay or a long stay, I promise you. it will be worth it!!

Since I have stayed in B&B's before I suggested rather than the hustle and bustle of Waikki for the first two days of our six days on Oahu, which was for both business & pleasure, to stay at the Inn. After her review I feel compelled to also write a comment.When no one answered the locked front door after at least three tries trepidation set in. Through the front door glass we could see a light on in the hallway and the owner's Jag parked in its marked spot. Figuring she might be out back we called her on her cell, and to our surprise she was in Maui having lunch and John, who we later learned is her boyfriend, was having lunch in Honolulu. Perhaps she forgot we were coming ?? We were given a code to take the key out of the lockbox to our room, but it was the key to the front door and not our room. So the owner's daughter was called to let us in and check the ledger for our room and give us a key -- it is about 1:30 p.m. in the afternoon -- and it turned out her mom had to wake her up to let us in. (She said she was 18). She showed us our room on the 3rd floor. There was no one there to help with the bags, though she did help my friend carry up one of hers. I asked about the provided breakfast and was told we had to let them know because not everyone eats it and they won't prepare it if you aren't going to be there and so we needed to sign in. I asked where to do that and was told that she would put a piece of paper out, but didn't really say where that would be.Once in the room we looked around and finally focused and really saw how dingy it was. Sure, the furniture is antique and the wood a little worn, which can be expected with antiques, but it wouldn't hurt to put some furniture polish on it to make it look clean. The plastic shampoo bottle on the dresser was foggy looking and tacky to the touch. The bedding looked worn and dingy/dirty and the room didn't smell exactly fresh. So we decided to leave. My friend told the daughter that we were leaving and we understood if we needed to pay for the first night. While carrying my bags down from the 3rd floor I saw the daughter in front of her room on the 2nd floor and she informed me that she spoke to her mother and that she would be refunding our money tomorrow as she is in Maui and John doesn't know how to do it. Don't know how John could have helped us since he wasn't even there. Thankfully I have a friend that lives about 3 miles up from the Inn and she helped us quickly find another hotel down by the zoo, which turned out to be just perfect. Instead of crediting my friend's card as promised for the pre-paid first night she was billed for a second night as well and is still awaiting credit. Another thing, we were told we were the only guests staying there which added to the uncomfortable feelings we were both having. That is why I wouldn't recommend this B&B until the ""For Sale"" sign in front says ""Sold"" and there are new owners.

From the pool one can see beyond the flowering shrubs and flowers a view of nearby Wakiki and Diamondhead. Outside our window one could see the top branches of a huge, old mango tree laden with fruit, which the owners picked and served daily with breakfast on the verandah -- one morning we even had mango muffins, which were superb. The Inn is located so that all points of interest can be reached easily by car. The hosts are gracious and helpful as well as knowledgeable about the island's attractions.

Those two things were the key to what it was like to stay there; we stayed six nights.This place has the potential to be a lovely B & B. It has a location near the University of Hawaii, and access to Honolulu/Waikiki is easy, but it's out of the hustle and bustle. It has a wonderful veranda that spreads across the whole back of the house with terrific views of Honolulu, especially at night. It's an old, original, huge Hawaiian house that's on the National Register of Historic Places.But the problem is that this place needs someone who actually wants to run this place to come in and take over. John and Theresa, the owners, have long since burned out on this place, and they're trying to get out. They're nice enough people, but they do everything themselves there, and they just don't want to do it anymore. Hence, the place is dirty, almost no service in your room, and the exact same breakfast every morning. Not only was our room dirty when we moved in, it was never vacuumed during our six days there, even though it obviously needed it. Your room is serviced only when you request it, and then only the minimum service possible. Theresa drives a Jag, and you can imagine how enthusiastic she is about scrubbing your toilet. We came in one day to find the bed made and all the dirty towels still on the floor of the shower.The room itself was not just dirty, the old Victorian furniture is tired and worn and cluttered looking. I never thought there could be such a thing as dead plastic flowers, but there is a vase of them on the landing to the second floor. And, there are no common areas in the B & B except for the veranda. The owners occupy the first floor and you aren't allowed into their areas, including the kitchen.The owners have two little dogs. One morning, as we were having breakfast on the veranda, one of the dogs proceeded to drop of pile of doggy-doo beside our table. Our breakfast was over for that morning. Two nights later we were walking up the landing to our second floor room and my girlfriend stepped in a pile of doggy-doo that one of the dogs had thoughtfully left us on the Oriental carpet. She was almost in tears over that one.Breakfast is served on the veranda and, while it's a lovely location, the breakfast consists of fruit, cereal, and bread, bagels etc., and coffee and tea. It was fine for a couple of mornings, but got old by the end. The owners claim and read the newspaper before they bring it out to the guests; would it really be too much expense to get two newspapers? The owners make no effort to do anything more than the minimum for breakfast. Or anything else, for that matter.At one point John came to me and told me that I had parked my car in ""Theresa's space,""and asked me to move it. There was nothing to indicate in their tiny parking lot, that there was a reserved space for one of the owners, no ""Reserved,"" or ""Theresa's Space,"" we were just supposed to know that, I suppose.As much as I wanted to like this place, it desperately needs new ownership. It certainly isn't a 5-star establishment, maybe two stars at the most, and that's generous. I've stayed in some pretty great B & Bs, and this one is a failure on almost every level.","Santa Monica, California","Incognito-one</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Monica, California</strong>",79,2.0

I thought we might enjoy something a little different than the beachfront resort thing our first night, so I (somewhat nervously) reserved a night in the Davies Room at the Manoa Valley Inn in Honolulu, near the University district. We were not disappointed, and it was a beautiful, peaceful and comfortable one-night stay.The owner, Theresa, met us on check-in and kindly helped us with ice, and with information about the room, the grounds, breakfast, bottled water, etc., and we got settled into the room after a brutal day of travel--about fifteen hours' worth by the time we got to the Inn.The Davies Room is on the third (top) floor of this charming and historic Inn, and it has a private bathroom. (If you're really tall like I am, you need to be a little careful moving around in the bathroom and shower, or you can use the full-sized antique bathtub in the hall bathroom.) This room has a wonderful view of the expansive lights of Waikiki, but from a nice, quiet distance. We found the bed to be wonderful and extremely comfy, and the room was clean and very tastefully appointed. (I enjoyed the Maxfield Parrish print of ""Daybreak"" in our room... it's so full of peace and ecstasy.) The screened windows were all open when we entered the room and we left them open all night long. The peaceful sounds, the soft lights, the gentle breeze, and a nice ceiling fan provided a wonderful ambience that helped us begin our ""decompression"" and relaxation process.Our bodies were on Colorado time, so we naturally woke up at 6 a.m., and everything was still very peaceful, except that the most wonderful bird songs were now being performed for us--it was quite enchanting. I'm an opera singer, and one of the birds sang a song that reminded me of the Queen of the Night aria from Mozart's ""Magic Flute."" (That's my story and I'm sticking to it.)My wife, a professional hairstylist, had forgotten her shampoo, and she commented that she was impressed with the quality of the hair products in the room--in case anyone is wondering.We went down for breakfast promptly at 7:30 and were very happy to find delicious fruit (pineapple, apple and some fantastic papaya) along with delicious coffee, orange juice, hard-boiled eggs and breads for toasting. The beautiful veranda had lovely views of the lush and well-kept grounds. My wife, who doesn't share my ""lumberjack"" breakfast tastes, was happy with all of it (""perfect""), and so was I.Unfortunately, we didn't get an opportunity to try out the heated salt-water pool in the garden (available to discreet guests anytime day or night), but we really enjoyed a short walk around the yard and the gardens. There are some lovely places to relax and smoke outside in designated areas. Unfortunately, I hadn't hit the cigar shop yet, but I regretted not having the opportunity to have a nice, quiet smoke out in the lush backyard.Theresa helped us with directions to local shopping in the neighborhood, and also kindly passed along her insider tips for eating and beach-activities on the island.We're looking forward to going back, and we recommend this property whole-heartedly to anyone who is looking for a simple, lovely and comfortable stay at a reasonable price.","Carmel, California","PJTuff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carmel, California</strong>",1,4.0

And I just couldn’t believe what I read and what I experienced is the same thing. Let me summarize the differences:o. Room – as some previous reviewers pointed out, it’s dusty, musty and fading. You have to keep the fan going all the time to expel the musty smell. Half the windows don’t open, the ones that open are propped up with a stick. It also has the most interesting (or least user-friendly) lavatory and faucet in my life. The spout of the faucet sits against the side of the sink, thus there is no room for your hands underneath. The only way to wash your hands is fill the sink with water, which is time-consuming and wastes water. Oh, and did I mention the big cockroach in the room?o. Breakfast – It's meager. One word to describe the bread is “stale”. Orange juice must be very expensive in Oahu as there is never enough. One morning we were the first to arrive at the breakfast table and the orange juice jar was only half-filled, it didn’t even fill 4 small glasses and it wasn’t refilled even when we left. Yogurt made rare appearances in some days and totally disappeared in others.o. Public Area – other than a porch in the back there is NONE. The owners took up the first floor, thus there is no parlor, no living room, no reading room as mentioned in some tour books.o. Swimming Pool – owners only. The best part of the backyard is closed off with a gate and a sign on the door “Owners only”. Looking in from the gate it’s a lovely area complete with a palapa thatched pavilion and a pretty pool with stone waterfall that you could only drool about.o. AC – again first floor only, that means the owner’s residence only.o. Room Safe – I finally found one in the far end of our closet with its door completely blocked by an old mattress.o. Phone – None. They don’t even have a basic phone, where is the dataport mentioned in the book?o. Parking – not guaranteed. Some nights we couldn’t find parking and had to park across the street.I truly believe there must have been a change of ownership some time ago since it’s very different from the place described by the tour books. It probably used to be a nice, classy place but with the current owners it’s run like a Motel 6.

Since my mom is in a wheelchair my top criterion is wheel chair accessibility. The owner assured me that they have a “lovely cottage” in the garden that’s ground level and wheel chair accessible (not the Alexander cottage, which wasn’t available), “No, there is no picture on the web, it’s newly added and it’s lovely.”, I was assured. Turns out this “lovely cottage” is a converted garage! No, converted garage is an euphemism, it’s the original garage structure with a bunch of cheap furnitures thrown in, or it’s more like a carport since the walls don’t go all the way to the ceiling. The area between the walls and the ceiling is enclosed with tattered screens, with bigger holes filled in with tissues (to keep off bugs?) This “cottage” is reachable by a narrow and winding path made of gravels and paving stones, it would probably fit the wheel chair if I cut the chair in half length-wise. On top of that it’s totally unlit. Since we arrived after dark and it was raining, even I (an avid hiker) had problem negotiating it, not to say my 85 year old mom in a wheel chair. How we stumbled to the room was a mystery. After a careful study I found there were actually flood lights outside the door (as it’s a garage) but it took us even longer to find the switch because it’s taped shut! An un-lit, uneven path is a hazard to anyone, and this is what they called “wheelchair accessible” room??? If their goal is to achieve a “garage theme” I’d say they are very successful. The light fixture in the center of the room is a fluorescent shop light, true to its past. The closet is the plastic kind that hangs from the ceiling. The bedding is the cheapest, ugliest I have ever seen compared with the B&B’s I have stayed (which is a lot, as you can see I would choose a B&B instead of a Waikiki high-rise). There are no windows, but thanks to the screened-in gap between the walls and the ceiling there is plenty of ventilation, maybe too much since every night the wind was howling and it blew from one end to the other and was excruciatingly noisy. On top of that you still hear street noise, this place is in no way “quiet” as described by some tour books. There was no hot water the first night, when I reported the problem to the owner I got blank stares. I had to suggest “Can you take a look” before I got a response.

I wanted to be out of the fast pace of Honolulu, so found this b and b - the website made it look as if the place was in a secluded valley, but it is in suburbia - 1st issue. We arrived to have the owner almost demand our visa as we walked in the door and got a 'you are on the third floor - you have lots of bags, but you're young!'. No help with those, but I still have an open mind. Room was fine - no tv which isn't a big deal, half used shampoos (ok, I'm not fussy, but that's just stingy!). Breakfast the next morning we were down there at 730 as directed. The breakfast consists of a few muffins, coffee that runs out in 5 minutes, had to ask for milk, a bit of fruit. Really, very average for somewhere calling themselves a b and b. We ended up eating at a nearby cafe since we found the whole breakfast thing quite stressful rather than relaxing as a b and b should be. The owners are interesting people - pretend to be super friendly, but are very rude, in what they see is normal behaviour. My fiancee and I have stayed at hundreds of places throughout Europe, the states and Oz, and this b and b was awful. It is very overpriced and while a jaguar sits out front, the owners are stingy in their hospitality.

Upside - in a quiet neighborhood with gorgeous landscaping in the backyard, 1.9 miles from Waikiki. The house was built in 1912 with a massive amount of wood from the N.W. I had no issue with the decorations or bedding, but the bathrooms were not re-stocked daily with simple things like soap, tp and shampoo. We had both a private bath and a shared bath (needs a new shower) on this visit. While the veranda was very nice, everything there was rather dirty. The in-room literature said we could use beach towels, but the owner was very put out about getting us the towels when I (very politely) asked after I had mentioned we were going to the beach one hour earlier. After the second day, I found it easier to talk with her husband (if you can find him) and avoided her at all cost after having more run-ins with her. Not the best host. The 'breakfast' would be considered continental by most standards, not a b & b breakfast. I would recommend different managers to bring the place up to snuff, then it would be fabulous.","Seattle, WA","Dream26752</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, WA</strong>",17,2.0

The place charges top dollar for rooms that are musty, dusty and fading. for our room we had to cross the living area, the hallway, the owner's dining room and the pantry to get to our ""private bath"" which though clean was poorly ventilated. The door connecting to the living room from our unit could not be locked. A fact which Theresa dismissed: ""With oh yes, those old doors."" The other door which led outside was difficult to lock because the handle kept falling off. ""Breakfast"" as noted by another reviewer was so far from the expected standards of B and B's as to be unworthy of the name. The windows were covered with sheet like fabric that did little too diminish the intensity of the searchlights shining through our windows. It was like trying to sleep on the beach. (Which would in every respect have been more pleasant.)There must be something good to say. Oh yes, the verandah is lovely, but since they had workmen pounding on cabinets there , it's loveliness was diminished to say the least.The owners need an education in what even a minimal B & B is.",Hawaii,"Road802724</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hawaii</strong>",20,1.0

Until now. The Moana Valley Inn was a major disappointment. The staff was nice enough but the inn lacked the usual thoughtfulness and care that typically accompanies inns and B&Bs. From the faded comforter on our bed, to the peeling paint, to the can of ""Raid"" ant killer in our bathroom (in plain sight!), to the day old newspaper at breakfast, to the raggedy landscaping, it was evident that no one cared. And we stayed in the most expensive room in the inn - the Alexander Cottage - described as an ideal spot for honeymooners. It did not inspire romance at all.Breakfast, typically a place for B&B's to shine, was dismal. All we got to eat was a fruit plate and piles of white bread with a toaster. That was it. Drinks included some sort of fruit punch, coffee, and tea. The location for breakfast was the back veranda, which had a wonderful view of Honolulu. That and the friendly cat ""Yoda"" were the two highlights of the inn. Everything else was disappointing. Note: They have two dogs in addition to the cat.","Leesburg, VA","Leesburg_VAWilson</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leesburg, VA</strong>",34,2.0

We enjoyed our stay there. The rooms are large and beautifully decorated. The showers are great, very large. We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood that enabled us to hear the birdsong in the mornings. The gardens and yards are beautifully displayed and cared for. Our breakfasts on the lanai were delicious, ample, and relaxing while we enjoyed the view of Diamondhead. John and Teresa were very helpful in making our stay a happy and enjoyable time. They provided us with directions to a specific shopping excursion and provided information on good restaurants for lunch.","Chebanse, Illinois","Getaway25004</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chebanse, Illinois</strong>",10,4.0

Everything was so dusty and dirty, I didn't feel comfortable sitting on any of the furniture! There was a condom wrapper poking out of the bedskirt and other people's clothes in the drawers. I'd say this B&B was in its prime about 30 years ago. When we went, the inn was owned by a husband and wife who were both very bizarre (paranoid schizophrenics perhaps?). The only good thing about the place was the husband told us about a great beach. As it happened, I left my bathingsuit in the shower and called from the big island to see if they could ship it over. After several calls, and giving them our Fed EX number, they finally sent it. It took five days (!!) and it was sopping wet and very ruined. If you like trash, this place is for you.","Irvine, CA","DeirdreC3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Irvine, CA</strong>",15,1.0
