This is the place to stay if you are looking for a comfortable place in the heart of Waikiki. It is a secure condo-hotel with nice views of Diamond Head to the east, and partial view of the shoreline. It is within walking distance of everything in Waikiki and I realized what a great location as you can easily get in and out due to its location. The International Marketplace, and Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and dozens of eateries are within 10 minutes walk.Parking is a bit expensive with limited on-street parking. Having a rental agency attached to the hotel helps a lot if you're doing day trips - you can save the cost of parking and spend it on the vehicle. Otherwise, it's probably better to share-ride it in.My only criticism is the bathrooms are a bit small; but little inconvenience, considering everything else.",Lihue,"Samurai055</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lihue</strong>",0,5.0

We enjoyed our stay here at Island Colony, the staff was nice and helpful, not to mention professional. If there was anything that we needed they jumped on it right away, whether it was getting extra towels, picking up mail, or assisting us with extending our stay which was a breeze. Jaime was the best! As soon as we met him he had this warm and humbleness to him. He helped us get a feel to the neighborhood, letting us know what to do, and where to shop that was family oriented for my husband, kids and I. Of course we were new to the island so we didn’t have a clue on what to to do and where to go. He took a major burden off us, and helped us to adapt a lot faster, he even gave us discounted tickets to the upcoming Circus! I could never Thank him enough.

We had no complaints with our room 4304. The view was good. One elevator was out of order when we arrived, they would need more if they had twice as many. The little restaurant look like it was permanently closed. The hot tub was wrapped with yellow crime scene tape and a stupid sign that said under construction, it looked like a just needed cleaned. The parking garage is practically empty for good reason, I have stayed in cheaper motels, the ceiling is so low our pick up antenna scraped the entire time. It cost more a day to park our vehicle than it did to rent it. Overall, if you must vacation in Waikiki this is not a bad choice, everywhere has a resort fee and a parking problem. We are from Nebraska. After four days we left early and went to California and had a better time for half the money.

Important for expensive and hot Waikiki. Hotel is well located for shopping with the beach a 10 minute walk. Rooms have been updated and a good size but missing a bedside lamp due to the bed being uncomfortably close to one wall. Was missing a TV remote and a HDMI cable for our free DVD rental but was fixed promptly. Air con was present but in a cheap and extremely noisy after market add on. Would benefit from a ceiling fan.My major bug bear however was paying the $200 ""resort fee"" which was non-refundable to then find out from a notice in the lift that the pool and spa would be out of order for our whole stay. No mention of this from the staff or even a reduction in the fees to compensate for this. Resort fee is a joke, considering their free shuttle seldom arrived and the route too complicated, so we took the public bus which was quicker. I realise that the pool needs maintaining but some compensation needs to be made to customers staying there as having a functioning pool is pretty important in a place like Hawaii.A good budget hotel but it might pay to call the hotel to make sure their pool is in working order if this is very important to you.","Melbourne, Australia","highdeez</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",30,3.0

The hotel overall is a tiny bit dated but didn' mind too much as we weren't planning to stay in the room too much but would have been helpful to have a restaurant. We arrived early so room wasn't ready but the receptionist Steven was really helpful and friendly whom requested for us and upgrade us to a room with a view. The room has 2 Queen beds with a kitchenette and balcony. The view was stunning, we have the river/lake on left, diamond straight ahead and the beach on our right. The most disappointing part of the room is the bathroom, was absolutely tiny and you would be squished if there was two people. The water pressure was awful for the shower as well, it was dribbling like a leaky tap. The other thing I did not like was the aircon, was soo loud like an airplane landing and wasn't really powerful either. I managed to ignore it as I was so jetlagged and tired but in general it wasn't as subtle as a more modern AC. The areas I did like about the hotel is that it has a self service laundry area, takes about 45 mins to wash and to dry clothes .You can buy the detergents from the machines (1usd) and costs less than 10usd to use the machines, we did the laundry twice. I also love the mini mart located in the hotel, really useful if you do not want to venture out and needed snacks or snacks.

There’s also a little shop on the 6th floor in case you forget something like your razor or sunscreen, which I did :) Great experience overall and highly recommend!",,Djterry40,1,5.0

I only found out when I arrived at the building.Island Colony manager gave me a special deal so I could afford to stay there.My family could stay at the Island Colony Hotel for 21 nights in August 2019.Hotel was excellent.Great Location (Center of Waikiki, 1 block to T-Galleria/Waikiki Business plaza)Clean and spacious rooms. (Large lanai, good view)Kind and responsive staff.Free 43F rooftop cocktail hour on Tuesdays with amazing views!Great pool.Nice extras and facilities included.Free DVD rental, daily newspaper and PlayStation in room.High power hair drier.Very good security (key cards needed to enter building and operate elevators)Free pool/beach towelsConvenience store on hotel 6F open until midnight.Washers/driers on 6F.Long Story:First of all I want to say a big thank you to Marlon (the manager), Rick (the security guard at the main entrance desk), Mike (at the front desk), and the Island Colony Office staff on the 6th floor. Without their kind help, my 10 year wedding anniversary trip to Hawaii would have been a nightmare.The Island Colony building has both hotel rooms and privately owned condos. I had originally booked and paid for a rental condo on AirBnB 10 months earlier. I always book early to get the lowest prices, otherwise there would be no way I could stay 3 weeks in Hawaii in August. I flew from Japan and got a taxi to the hotel for 31 dollars pre-booked with Charley's Taxis. When I arrived at the hotel and tried to open the lockbox for the room key, the code I had received did not work. I called my condo rental contact and he said ""Didn't you get my email?"" You can guess the rest. He had sent me an email while I was already on my flight to Hawaii saying that he was cancelling the booking. His reason was ""the laws have just changed in Hawaii and this kind of condo cannot be rented for periods of less than 30 days."" It turned out that the law had been changed on August 1st, but the condo I reserved 10 months previously had a 30-day minimum stay requirement anyway. So 10 months previously he knew that rule, ignored it and took my reservation anyway. Cancelling my reservation last minute was ridiculously unprofessional. Then, the condo rental contact gave me a number for AirBnB and told me to call that for more assistance. He basically cancelled me last minute and gave me a phone number.It was at this moment that Rick (the security guard at the entrance desk to the Island Colony building) saw something was wrong and asked me what the problem was, took my name, checked it on the computer, said my name was in the system for that room, and told me to go up to the 6th floor office to get more assistance. He could have sat there and done nothing but he actively helped me and directed me to the office.At the 6th floor office, another staff member kindly let me use their phone to call the AirBnB number. After speaking to AirBnB they said they would find another Airbnb property of similar price for me and that I should wait for their email. The Island Colony Office staff then personally took me downstairs and suggested I try the hotel front desk to see if they had any spare rooms in case we couldn't get another AirBnB place, and also at least to have somewhere just for that night. She explained my situation to Mike at the front desk and he then searched on the computer for what was available. He managed to find a room, but the price was well beyond my means, but I thought I at least needed somewhere for that night as backup, so he gave me a key to go and take a look at it. It was a really nice room, so I understood the price.When I went back down to the lobby Mike had taken the initiative to speak to the manager and had been able to get a reduced rate for me due to my unlucky situation. That was really good of him to make that effort when he didn’t have to. So again, another member of staff at the Island Colony had made an effort to help me without me having to ask for it. That was really great in such a stressful moment. AirBnB got back to me and said they could not find another AirBnB property so I should find a hotel instead and they would refund my reservation and cover some but not all of the extra cost. After looking at the internet, I realized even by paying 50% more than I had budgeted, my family of 3 was going to end up in a 1 star small room somewhere in Honolulu, not Waikiki. I could not afford the Island Colony and my anniversary was going to be a nightmare. I even checked how much it would cost to change my tickets and just go back home.I went back to the front desk and asked one more time if they could lower the cost. I didn’t think they could, but I had to try, and Mike again went back to his manager and asked for me. This time, Marlon, the manager himself came to the front desk and did some magic on the computer and gave me a special price that I could afford. Mike then spent 15 minutes on the computer doing more magic and fixed it to get us a better room with two large beds instead of one king and a rollaway that had been offered before. The manger even added in a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates to helps us celebrate our 10 year anniversary. I couldn’t believe it! They had saved my vacation. Suddenly needing to find a room with 2 beds and a kitchenette for 21 nights on August 5th in Waikiki on a slim budget? Mission impossible. The extra mile that the Island Colony hotel went to really helped get through an impossible situation. A thousand thanks to all of you!The HotelI usually stay in vacation rentals for longer vacations, but my experience at the Island Colony made me reconsider things. I really did enjoy the daily housekeeping, fresh sheets, clean bins, fresh coffee, toiletries, clean towels, prompt support and other benefits that come with staying at a good hotel. With a vacation rental, you are on your own and when I have had problems in previous vacation rentals (blocked sinks, broken fixtures, ants, cockroaches, no hot water, broken internet), it took time for support or help to come and fix things, and sometimes not at all. I recommend the Island Colony hotel very much.RoomThe room was a good size and the three of us had no problems living there for 3 weeks. It had two large beds with space to walk around both sides of each bed. It had a bedside table with drawer, light and socket plugs for phone charging. It had a long drawer/shelf unit in front of the beds under the TV with 4 spacious drawers, 2 shelves and desk area with large mirror. There was enough space to open three large trunk cases on the floor and still be able to walk around the room. There is also a double door closet with hangers, shelf space, security box, iron, ironing board (full-size, not mini).LanaiThe wall with the lanai is all windows to let lots of light in. The lanai was much bigger than my previous experiences in Hawaii. You could fit two king size beds side by side on it. There is a large table and two chairs there so you can eat your breakfast out there or have a drink and stare at the beautiful green mountains on one side. You can also see the beach and ocean through the other buildings on the other side. My room also had a good view of Diamond Head in the distance, too. The hotel is right next to the canal at the back of Waikiki, which gives a nice open feeling. You don’t feel boxed in by other hotels and buildings at all.KitchenIt had a fridge, sink, 2 electric hobs, cupboard space above, cooking utensils, cutlery, coffee maker with daily refills of filter coffee (not instant), both caffeinated and decaffeinated. It had a microwave, rice cooker, toaster and also frying pan and a cooking pot. You can use the coffee maker to make hot water for instant noodles, etc if needed.BathroomThe bathroom was very clean, with shower and bath. Toiletries were replaced daily and included shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion. The hair drier was surprisingly powerful which was good. (In other hotels I have had the problem of low power hair driers taking ages to do the job and twice actually shorting out the electrics in the whole room.) There were plenty of towels with extras on the shelf under the sink.HousekeepingThe room was well cleaned and housekeeping was very responsive to our requests. Due to jet lag we were sometimes up late and a quick phone call to the front desk made sure our room was cleaned even if we went out at 3pm. On the second day the housekeeper asked me what coffee I liked and then gave me my preferred caffeinated coffee for the rest of my stay. A small but nice personal touch. When my child left his soft toy on the floor, we returned to find it cutely waiting tucked up in bed. Again, a small but nice touch. When I mentioned the DVD player skipped a few times, the same day it was replaced. In all cases there was fast and courteous responses to our requests.StaffI found the staff to be very polite and welcoming. You can build a nice hotel, but you need the staff to make it a great place to stay and this hotel is lucky enough to have that. At large resorts, it is hard to feel that personal touch, but in the Island Colony some staff quickly remembered my name and helped create a welcoming atmosphere. The hotel had an event each Tuesday where from 5-6pm there were complimentary cocktails and snacks on the rooftop (43rd floor, I think.) with some staff members and the manager. The 360 degree views were amazing and it was nice to have a few drinks up there. It all added to a relaxing, friendly atmosphere.LocationThe hotel is in a great location. I have previously stayed at both extremes of Waikiki, near the Marriot on one end and at the Hilton Village and Ilikai at the other. The Island Colony is right in the middle of Waikiki. It is just a short walk (1 block) to Kuhio Avenue and T-Galleria, The Waikiki Business Plaza, Nordstrom Rack, Ross, 24-hour McDonalds, ABC marts and so on. Then just 1 more block to the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center. You are close enough to easily drop off shopping bags in your room and go out again or even take an afternoon rest and go back out again. The location really changed the feel of trip since we were right next to the center of Waikiki. There also major bus stops just at the Kuhio Avenue so you can catch the E bus to Waikele, or the 42 to Pearl Harbor or 13 + A to Pearl Ridge. If you have a JCB card, you can ride the pink trolley for free which also stops nearby.BeachYou can walk to Waikiki beach and the quickest way is actually to walk straight for 2 blocks, past Ross, through the Royal Hawaiian shopping center, through the pink colored Royal Hawaiian hotel to the beach. We could walk in our flip-flops from the hotel to the beach and never felt it was too far. In fact, we went to the beach more times than we have done on previous holidays because it was so easy to pick up fresh towels from the hotel, walk down to the beach, enjoy it, come back and hand the towels back. Very little hassle. I don’t think the Island Colony can advertise to people that they can walk through the Royal Hawaiian Hotel to the beach, but it is the quickest route.Other DetailsTaxi from airport to hotel 31 USD with Charley’s Taxis. Took less than 30 minutes to get there. Can make online reservation.Bus to Pearl Harbor Museum 5.50 USD one day adult ticket. (Children 5 or under do not need tickets). Take the No. 42 bus direct to the museum. Took about 1 hour with no changes.Bus to Waikele Premium Outlets 5.50 USD one day adult ticket. Took about 1h20m with 1 change. Take the E bus, then change to the 433 bus.Bus to Diamond Head 5.50 USD one day adult ticket. Took about 20 minutes with no changes. Take the number 2 bus to Kapiolani Community College (KCC) and walk from there. Takes about 1 hour to walk up and down the main trail once there. There is a 1 USD entry fee per person including children.Pink trolley is free for JCB card holders. Before you go to Hawaii, see if your credit card provider can give you another card with JCB instead of VISA. Then you can get free trolley rides when needed between Ala Moana and Waikiki.(If you found this review useful, why not take a look at my books available on Amazon ""Hanatoki: Japan Flower Shop"", ""Winning Sports Betting Strategies"" and ""Big Data Betting"" by Tom Whitaker.)Once again, thank you so much to Marlon, Rick and Mike for saving my anniversary trip. I highly recommend this hotel for anybody considering staying in Waikiki.",,GoPlaces526866,2,5.0

First off, why 3-in-1? That's because our group consisted of 3 families all with small children and we stayed at 3 different floors/rooms. Therefore, I will include the experiences of what I've seen and heard from the 2 other rooms plus our own. The building/rooms: The building went up in 1979 and depending on which room you get, you might feel like you walked into the era when it's built. The furnishing, decor, bathroom fixtures all seemed like the original. The wife wasn't happy when first walked in however, the view won me over pretty quickly and her the next day. There are 2 types of rooms, studios with kitchenette or 1-bedroom with full kitchen, our party opted for the full kitchen. Full-size fridge, oven/range and microwave was present along with full supplies of dishware and utensils. All the rooms that end in 20 & 21 and in 00 & 01, are in my opinion, are the BEST. They are 1-bedrooms with the best views especially 21's as they face Waikiki in the living room and Diamond Head in the bedroom. Our room was 3621 and you can check out the photos below. The building has a mix residence, other than unit owners, the front desk also help manage short-term, long-term as well as AirBnB, therefore you will see people with different keyfobs/access cards. Rooms ending in 00 and 01 faces Ala Wai canal in the living room however 01's can see Downtown in the bedroom. Our friends stayed in 2801 and 2501 and their units were upgraded to more modern furnishing with new kitchen, floors, bathrooms etc. 2501 found 1 cockroach on day one and that was the only our entire group saw for 10 nights. You need a keycard to get access to the building, elevators as well as the pool and gym. Enterprise is located within the same building around the back which was super convenient as they share the same car park. Parking was $25/night for hotel guest. The resort fee was also $25 a night (yikes). There is a convenient store ran by some friendly Korean ladies on the 6th floor and bottled water is cheap there.Grab beach towels and chairs from the lobby before you head out and return it at the end of the day as they do track who and how many. Our unit 3621 had drainage issue upon check-in and their maintenance guy had already gone home for the night. However, they made the effort to send someone at a specific time the next day and the issue was resolved.Housekeeping did a good job every time we needed them and lady stocked lots of towels at least 10 pieces of mix sizes. However they knock early, like 9 AM early, I guess we were used to the afternoon ones like in Mexico. The location: Although it located at the ""back"" of Waikiki alongside Ala Wai Bvd, it only a 5-7 min walk to Kalakaua Ave, and it's located in central Waikiki via Seaside Ave so you are right in the middle to food/shopping and away from East Waikiki where things can get more sketchy. At no time did we ever felt unsafe around the hotel. Biki Bike rentals were located across the street along Ala Wai.The staff: WOW is what I have to say, prob one of the friendliest team of staff I've ever seen and they take ownership of your problems and questions. Special shoutout: Dan, Michael and Steve (I think that's what Steven Aoki will look like when he's older). In conclusion: I rate this hotel 3.5/5 because our suite was old, however, the view really made up for the shortcomings. Had our unit been fixed up like 25/2801 then I would bump up the score to 4.5/5. The price itself isn't ""cheap"" for what you get, but that's the price you pay to stay in paradise unless you want to fork out 400-600 for upscale hotels. The staff really is what made this place special!","Vancouver, Canada","NeoChaser</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",61,4.0

The hotel was in a great location with balcony views to the mountains and only minutes walk to shops/ Waikiki beach and a lovely coffee shop in the lobby.With the mixed reviews of the property we were quite sceptical. However, from arrival until departure the hotel front desk staff were always very helpful.We did encounter upon checking in, there were further charges of a daily hotel fee we needed to pay of which was not stated or charge at the time we originally booked through Agoda that had already been paid in full.We stayed in a Studio Kitchenette room on the 19thfloor. Our room was surprisingly large with plenty of space which was great. House keeping serviced our room daily, no issues with cleanliness. The room was equipped with a fridge, microwave, stove, kettle and utensils which was very useful.The only downside to the room was there was no ceiling light in the bedroom. We relied on the bedside lamp, floor lamp and entrance light to light up the room once sun went down. There was also no kitchen sink, we’d had to use the basin in the bathroom as a sink as well.Other than that, we didn’t have any major issues.   The property has just the amenities you need, a pool and spa, a gym, a convenient store and a 24/7 self service laundry room all on the one level.Overall a pleasant stay.","Sydney, Australia","xl0rrainex</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",5,3.0

The staff are helpful and friendly. If you are looking for a quality and comfortable hotel, then the Island Colony is just for you. However, if you are looking for an expensive fancy hotel, you should probably try the Ritz, Trump, or Hilton Hawaiian Village. This recently updated hotel sits back on the canal (so it’s a little quieter at night), but, it is only 2 blocks from the beach and right in the middle of Waikiki's best shopping and dining. The Island Colony is the tallest building in Waikiki, 44 floors. The updated, clean, and comfortable studios and one bedroom suites offer well equipped kitchenettes with spectacular panoramic views of Waikiki's skyline, Diamond Head, and the ocean. There is a coffee shop located in the lobby with limited hours. Hotel registration is open 24/7. The 24/7 maned security desk is in the elevator lobby. You must use your room key to enter the hotel/elevator lobby and to retrieve an elevator... this made me feel safe. There is an on-site mini market, laundry facility, Gym, barbecue area, pool, Jacuzzi, and sauna. This hotel has Free WiFi, free movie rentals, and free newspapers. On-site parking is available for a daily fee. Honestly, you won’t even need a Rent-A-Car. But, if you want to venture out of Waikiki, may I recommend just a day use rental car at the enterprise located just downstairs. Everything is pretty much within walking distance. Or, the Aqua Resorts offers a free 30 minute shuttle with several stops in Waikiki and at the Ala Moana shopping center located just outside of Waikiki. Just down the street from the shopping center you can find a Super Walmart and the Convention Center is located about a block away too. Otherwise, The Bus system is very convenient. This hotel does have a Resort Fee now. Also worth mentioning is that the Island Colony management offers guests access to the roof top once a week for free cocktails and appetizers.

My wife and I were visiting Hawaii for 10 nights as part of our honeymoon and after 5 nights in Singapore, we made the long 16 hour flight via Manila to Honolulu. On arrival we were informed we couldn't check into our room until 15:00 (frustrating after a tiring flight but fair enough). After returning to the hotel at the instructed time we were checked in and given the key to our room. Now bearing in mind we were paying $187 per night, upon entry to the room we were horrified. It was clear on first impressions that the advertisement from our accommodation provider was in no way reflective of what awaited us. Firstly, what can only be described as bodily excretions were splattered up the rear of the curtains and while on the subject - they looked like someone had taken a samurai sword to them. Despicable. Following on, the decor was old and battered with scuffs and scratches visible on every surface. The balcony was filthy with floor Staines everywhere, the sliding doors felt like were going to collapse and the less said about the wardrobe doors the better (Off the runners). Bathroom was absolutely ridden with suspicious looking staines and marks. Dusty old games consoles underneath the television?? Do me a favour. After our complaints about the room we were offered another but suffice to say it was as bad if not worse than the initial one. If there's a silver lining in this cloud, the gentleman on reception was very apologetic and understanding, and was very quick to provide us with a full refund. After our brief visit, its clear this hotel appeals to a particular type of clientele i.e. young groups/backpackers and it should be made abundantly clear when advertised that couples or families are not suited. I cannot stress how disgusted I am with this place and if I were in a position of authority within the accommodation/hospitality industry i'd be coming down on this establishment like a tonne of bricks. False advertisement laws are being broken on a colossal scale. I intend to pursue the matter further with our accommodation provider in order to prevent this happening to other unfortunate holidaymakers. It very nearly spoilt our visit to Hawaii and honeymoon on the whole.This is advertised and i quote as a 'clean, spacious and modern establishment' however this couldn't be further from reality. How dare they charge such an extortionate rate for a hotel bordering on a hostel. In fact, I've stayed in hostels across Europe that are cleaner and more modern.Avoid at all costs, pay the extra $20 a night and stay down the road.

So I am not surprised to see roaches in hotel rooms equipped with kitchen or kitchenette. This time, I bought yesterday a roach killers (not a pesticide) at a Long's Drugs to make our stay better, and set them around kitchen and bathroom because I don't like to see them. I hope they will work soon. I killed some roaches after that.Next to my room is a trash chute and so noisy until 10 at night, but it is closed since yesterday for an emergency repair, which makes us inconvenient but calm.I think the trash chute is one of the cause of roaches.Anyway, I come to be afraid to continue staying here because I don't want to take roaches back to my home packed in our baggages. How awful![TV story]They have cableTV tuners in guest rooms, but it is so difficult and takes time to understand how to use.Moreover, I could not watch TV's because of a signal loss until the second morning. I reported it to the front desk and they sent a room keeper.The guy said that not just our room but many are the same. They don't seem to have solution to this problem, so we still cannot watch TV. OMG!I'm afraid I can't watch TV until we check out. Too silent!I'd like to request a room change if it won't get better tomorrow.They should refund part of the amenity fee because we can't use them. We pay twenty-five dollars for the amenity.[Kitchen]Small fridge cannot stock many foods, so we can't protect our foods away from roaches.I don't want to place foods on the kitchen board.The sink is located in washroom which we should use for both kitchen and washroom, which makes us inconvenient to cook.[Air Conditioning story]AC is fantastically! noisy as someone reported before.Water produced in AC is collected in a bucket placed at Lanai (balcony) and become full in a several days... so far, so good.

Getting already frustrated from a long flight and then to this. Security gaurd was very rude I believe his name is Todd.He was very RUDE!! how can you have someone like that work there? anyways he rudely almost like shouting at me to go back to the front desk to check in. I told him that I was told to come to see secruity he said ""NO GO TO THE FRONT DESK TO CHECK IN NOT HERE WE DON""T DO CHEK INS HERE"" now i'm pissed3) I went back to the front desk and told the lady there in a very mad voice that someone better know something about my reesrvations because i'm getting sent here and there and no one wants to check me in , I paid for my stay and this is BS!! the lady at the font desk Teri was nice enought to ask me for my confirmation and help me check in. she called the numbe that was on my confirmation and she got someone to come downstairs and help me check in. Sy or Si came down and checked in me. Finally i'm checking in. 4) I get to my room and it's a nice room, nice view. Loving the the view that i'm getting. 5) middle of the night my AC stop working and my kids and I are buring in the room, I open the sliding door to let some air in the room but it doesn't seem to work. I call the agent about 10 times and leaves voicemails on every phone call that I made. it got to the point where I had my kids sleep on the chairs on the patio as I keep calling this people about the AC. The next morning still no one calls me back about my messages. I called and a guy name Zack answered and i'm already angry from the night before and I tell him about the ac and that we had to move the couch outside and in his defense he says that he doesn't work 24/7 so that's why he doesn't answers. I angrly tell him that when you have a business your phone should be on 24/7 regaurdless if your off or not. My kids had to sleep outside on the patio sitting up on the chairs because I couldn't get any help from them and he tells me ""well ma'am what do you want me to do? by another ac unit because your unit's ac is broken? how do we know if you didn't break it and trying to pin this on us?"" I was really surpised with what he told me I told him to refund me the rest of my 10 nights here i'm going to another hotel I don't tolereate this BS especially from someone that's getting paid a paycheck becaue of us. He tells me that he only can refund me for 8 nights because I used up 2 nights already. I demanded my refund and asked him to speak to manager because he needs to be fired to written up. He transfer's my call to a woman name chelsey and she's even worst then Zack. I packed up my things and went to their office on the 6th floor and demand my refund for 10 nights. I waited for them for about 1 and half in their office. Finally get my refund, my kids and I tells them that they are the worst and will not refere anyone to them, they just shrug their shoulders and laugh. VERY VERY VERY RUDE PEOPLE!!!

They also took forever bringing up at metal yes metal baby crib. No way would I let my one year old sleep in that thing and possibly get hurt smh.In another note the parking there is a separate company which is equally as terrible.

He cannot do anything about it as the hotel manager doesn't arrive til 11am.

In saying this, you are getting accommodation at a cheaper rate. Our room was clean and spacious with a small kitchenette to allow you to self cater. The bathroom was ridiculously small though and the shower head low but overall clean. The front desk staff are helpful but the ridiculous 3pm check in is a joke, especially when your flight gets in at 0600, but this seems the norm in Honolulu. Would recommend you book the room for the day before if your flight lands early. They did allow us to store our luggage during the day, allowing us to explore Waikiki. The bed was a king size but I found it along with the pillows, firm, but that is an individual thing. Aqua Skyline is ideally located being within 2 minute walk of places to eat and drink. There is a convenience store located on site which is a bonus along with a cafe in the lobby, be warned though, it's expensive. Car rental available on site and parking which is also expensive, park on the upper levels as the car parks are tiny on the first level and we came across numerous guests unable to get out as their vehicles were boxed in by bigger cars and pickups. Ask for a room facing the golf course and higher up as the noise is horendous in Waikiki. The pool and Jacuzzi were nice and towels were available at the pool, you could also get towels from the front desk if you were wanting to go the beach which is about a 10 minute walk. I don't think asking guests to pay a $25 USD resort fee is fair, considering we weren't able to use any of the facilities on the first day and last day considering we couldn't get into our room until after 3pm and were picked up at 0400 to catch our flight home. Would we stay here again? Well that would depend if I ever returned to Hawaii which I probably wouldn't, I found it to be overpriced, noisy and to be honest I could find 20 beaches in Victoria that are as good, if not better than any l had seen in Oahu never mind any number of beaches in Queensland that in my opinion are better. If I was to return though I would probably stay at the Aqua Skyline Island Colony for its price and location, if you are wanting that full hotel experience though were someone takes your bags to your room, room service etc, this is not the place for you.

Its got a nice coffee shop in the lobby and the general store on level 6 was well stocked and reasonably priced (similar to ABC pricing). The pool and spa were very good as was the furniture in the pool area. The bed was comfy. The negatives .... it didn't have that holiday fun feeling to it. Most of the people around the pool were residents in the building and appeared to be largely retirees. Nothing wrong with that and I spoke with many who were lovely people. The biggest issue for me was the AC in the rooms. I was in room 1007 and it was painfully noisy. I thought many reviews were exaggerating, but this was the noisiest AC I have heard.

Bed was comfy and if it wasn't for a very very noisy air con unit (that didn't seem to pump out cool air despite it being on 52 degrees, it was nice enough. If you can get on a higher floor I imagine it would be much quieter. We were on floor 8 overlooking the pool and it was noisy. For some reason they have slatted glass windows, meaning you can always hear what's going on outside. We had a group on a nearby Lanai and they were up until the early hours being loud and we had noway of escaping the noise. Pool looked nice, but had lots of families down there so we didn't use it, but were only here for a night before a flight out.Parking is $25 which is pretty standard for the area, easy to find a spot and park yourself.

I only have all good things to say about this hotel and its front desk staff Ms. Suki. The hotel offers amazing views and a great kitchenette that came in very very handy for us. The Front desk and guest services were very accommodative of our requests and provided us with Utensils etc. to suit our needs. Ms. Suki at the Front Desk was extremely courteous, remarkably nice and friendly to the hotel guests, and the hotel management should be very proud of employing such excellent staff like Suki who made our first Hawaii trip very memorable. Ms. Suki is one of the reasons I would absolutely go back to this hotel again on my next trip to Hawaii/Honolulu. The proximity of this hotel to the Waikiki Beach is perfect for the price, and the parking at this hotel comes at a very nominal rate of $25 per day compared to exorbitantly high parking prices that prevails around this neighborhood. The rooms are clean and well maintained. We loved the balcony, especially at the higher floors. The hot tub is quite big and is very nice. The Pool area is at the sixth floor level and has some nice shades and cushions to enjoy a sun bath. The laundry (washer/dryer) is very nominally priced and there is a convenience store on premise. The parking lot is integrated into the hotel, though operated by a third party. It is a covered multi-level parking facility. We walked to Waikiki beach through the International Market Place Mall and it takes just about 5 to 7 minutes to get to the Waikiki beach from the hotel. The hotel room key card is sensitive, so remember to keep it away from other electronics or magnetic stripes such as credit cards, chargers etc. I would strongly recommend this hotel to any type of travelers such as individuals, couples and families. The Kitchennette comes with a Two-top electric range, electric Rice cooker, a microwave, refrigerator, with utensils such as frying pan, boiling pan, tea mugs, glass cups, bowls, spatulas, spoons, cutting board, knife, Can/Opener etc. The room has a window A/C, which may look smaller but was able to cool the room very chill – more than what we could ask for and comes with a AC remote so you don’t have to get up from the bed to adjust it. if you are lucky you may get free public road-side parking along the Canal by the side of the hotel - make sure you read the parking sign as there are certain days you need to remove your car at 7 am after an overnight parking. This hotel also houses private condominiums, so some of the rooms with a hard lock in some floors are privately owned.

Reception staff were all friendly and helpful, especially Teri who checked us in and organised the upgrade.AC unit was old style through the wall and a little noisy but did its job of cooling well. Condensation drained into a bucket on the balcony/lanai and we needed to keep an eye on the amount of water and empty it a few times before it overflowed across the floor and would have cascaded down the building!Handy to have small convenience store on site and pool area and bbq facilities great.

It's like living in a condo yourself ; if the condo management council wants to upgrade, they have to raise an assessment and nobody wants to pay.This is obviously what's happening with this place, it could be so much better if it was run as as a hotel but that's not going to happen.I enjoyed my stay but my comments below will flesh things out.Everything is dated from the 70's and the pool wouldn't be out of place in one of those minimum security prisons. The water was cold and I could have got more agitation out of the jacuzzi if I used a swizzle stick!Don't expect a Hawaiian type welcome when you check in, it's just a vertical motel, the staff aren't paid to put on any form of show and so they don't.They're very pleasant people but they're like Government employees, they just do what's necessary to make sure you get settled in.But for $150 a night at an all inclusive posh resort in Mexico or Spain you get ten times the value, plus a warm pool and nightly entertainment (and food).You can't put that down to low wages in those countries, as I'm sure the hotel staff here in Hawaii are at the bottom of the scale too. There's two other things that are off-putting about this place .The first being that the reception area has all of the atmosphere of a Greyhound Bus Terminal, it's dated , forlorn and the furniture could have come straight from the Thrift Store, just sitting on it makes you feel a bit icky.The fact that the cafe is closed adds to a general impression of neglect, you feel like making a bid for the kitchen equipmentThe second one is the imposition of the daily ""amenities fee"" something that the profiteers dreamed up in Vegas that has spread like a virus to Hawaii.Why should I pay an extra $20 a day for stuff that should be the bread and butter service of a resort hotel? It's imposed like a ransom fee at check in (cash only) and if you don't want to pay it, then sleep next to the hobos on the Waikiki beachfront !Include it in the overall price for goodness sake! ( they probably can't do it because of the condo nature of the ownership- each room has a separate wifi access code)Despite all of these shortcomings it's still not a bad place to stay, the housekeeping staff did a good job, the sentry/receptionists at the front desk were very nice, if a little lacking in tourism skills and I'll have happy memories of staying there.With a little bit of dynamism from Aqua's management strategy this could be a much better place, for very little outlay they could spruce up the reception and pool areas and they could get away with charging a little bit more , everybody could be happier , staff, management AND guests","Vancouver, Canada","William C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",167,3.0

We booked two rooms on higher floor and to the back of the hotel. We got exactly what we had asked for , but after the first night my friends who had a beautiful big corner room found it to be a little noisy because of road traffic. We mentioned this at the front desk the next day and it was no problem at all to move them to another room. All rooms and balconies were fairly large , modern and clean, as was the overall whole hotel. Great pool area with bbq's and a convenient little shop that sold everything ! Lobby area was huge with comfortable lounges and seating with a nice cafe'. Hotel security was another one of those extra little things , at night security were at a desk watching people entering and exiting and you had to use your room card to enter the foyer and then the lifts to your room. Location was fantastic and close to everything yet far enough away from the noise and action on ""Kuhio"". The best part about this hotel is the friendly and more than helpfull staff , nothing was ever a problem. An example of this was when one of my friends had trouble with her phone and was wanting to contact home as her father was in hospital having an operation. The girl at the front desk actually let her use her personal phone , rang the number and passed it to her so she could talk to her family. I was amazed by the girls concern and help !

However, I had provided some constructive feedback regarding my stay. Not often does a hotel care enough to follow up on feedback, but surprisingly Aqua Skyline at Island Colony did. Their hotel manager Brian Kovaloff promptly contacted me in response to my feedback, addressed the issues and requested I try the hotel again. Brian then promptly put me in touch with Guest Services Manager Marlon Henobio. Management clearly care about the reputation of their hotel and the satisfaction of their guests. I am so glad I gave this hotel another chance because my stay was superb. We received superior customer service and great level of communication. We visit Hawaii every year and will certainly be returning to this hotel. I can't thank management enough for making this trip one to remember.

I got sick during my flight from Florida and arrived to an undesirable hotel. I had a weird feeling before my trip and thought I should change my hotel, but decided against it because maybe I was overthinking. I should have followed my first instinct. The hotel was not up to my standards. I booked this hotel based off the pictures and the few good reviews, but those pictures must have been taken over 10 years ago. The first room had a full kitchenette which would have been fine, but everything looked unclean, and the a/c unit gave no directions for turning it on. The curtain was broken so I couldn't even close it all the way and the tub was Nasty. I called the front desk and was told that I could move me to another room. Once I got into the second room, the sheets were spotted and nasty. I got a call from the front desk asking was it okay, I told him no and explained the sheets and again a nasty tub. He sent housekeeping who said that it looked fine and they should have changed the sheets, but she would. She left and I called Delta to find another hotel, I would not touch anything but the chair at the desk and the phone (probably what made me worse). The housekeeper came back up and only wanted to change the top sheet until I asked was she going to change all of them, she said it was new, well I looked at her funny and then she pulled off all the sheets, there were crumbs, possibly bugs, and hair on the sheets. I was DISGUSTED. I knew I could not stay there one night, let alone 5. Needless to say, Delta found another hotel close by and I left. To think they also charge $18.95 a day as a resort fee.

I was bringing my 18 & 22 year old children and anything less would not work. I am use to staying in two bedroom villas since I'm use to staying in timeshares. When you first walk into the reception area, you'll notice it outdoors but covered. It was very nice. Check in was easy. There was a problem because our second room for my sister and nephew was not next to ours. Because these are rented condos, you are not guaranteed rooms, only views. In other words, if you thought you were getting a two queens, city view with only two people....you may get a king with city view. That's what happened to my sister. But the next day, she was switched to a two queen bedroom. But, we still were not together. I was on 31st floor and she was on 37th. I will say, the view was excellent. We got the view of the mountains and the ocean in the distance. We were only two blocks back from the main street and smack dab in the middle of EVERYTHING. This is the best location for pick ups for most activities. No need to have a car. We used uber (which was reasonable) for everything we felt was not in walking distance. Although...most things are within walking distance. The pool was closed most of the time we were there but we didn't care. We jam packed our trip with activities that included the beach. We walked to the beach which took 10 minutes due to the lights. My fridge did not work the first night but it was replaced the next morning. The elevators were hot and the hallways to get to your room was a little sketch but, not enough to deter us. Again, not something I'm use to. The bathrooms were tiny. I'm 5' 8 1/2"" and I barely fit under the shower. My other family members could not fit. It's made for a way shorter person. They do have laundry facilities on-site which is really nice.

I have been to Waikiki several times and found that many of the hotels are fairly average (due to their age) for the price you pay, unless you stay at a 4-5 star at hotel with a very high price tag. I was looking for a reasonably priced hotel so we could save our money for shopping! The Aqua Skyline at Island Colony had everything I was looking for. It is located on Seaside Ave, only a few minutes walk to Kalakaua Ave (main street) and close to the Beachwalk, Victoria's Secret, Sephora, Macy's, Footlocker and lots of other great shops. It was easy walking distance to The Cheesecake Factory and California Pizza Kitchen (2 of my favourite places to eat with teenagers). It was also a short walk to Bills Sydney to get my great 'Aussie' coffee each morning. There is also a pick-up point for many of the day tours just around the corner in front of IHOP, and easy access to the The Bus (local bus network).We stayed in a Studio Kitchenette room with 2 queen beds. This was great it you want to have toast/cereal for breakfast. Mc Donald's is also just around the corner if you want to grab a quick breakfast. The room was just like the pictures on the website. The only issues were the air conditioner was quite noisy and the shower head was quite low. Not a real problem though as you got used to it, and the other benefits outweighed these issues.The hotel has a great pool/spa area with a convenience shop on this level. It is open till late and prices are the same as the local ABC stores (including alcohol) which is really convenient.The rate also includes DVDnow. You select a DVD or PS3 game from the self-serve machine at Reception and play it in your room, which was great.There is also an ice-water dispenser at Reception which is great to grab a drink when you walk in from the beach. Don't worry about bringing your beach towel because the hotel provides these for you, clean daily.Every week they have a complimentary 'Welcome Cocktail' on the rooftop which I thought was a very nice gesture, and also provides a great photo opportunity.They also have a regular complimentary shuttle to Ala Moana shopping Centre which leaves from a sister Aqua hotel around the corner.The staff were friendly and helpful. Arriving from Sydney on a flight at 6am, Reception was happy to store our luggage.

It wasn't terrible but it wasn't really great either. There is plenty of construction going on in front which was a little inconvenient. The parking garage is convenient but also $25 a day so make sure to add that on to your budget. I am guessing, the higher up you go, the nicer the rooms are. We stayed on the 11th floor which surprisingly isn't that high. We were right next to the trash chute so the hallway always kind of smelled of garbage. The room was fine but falling apart a little bit. The view is pretty decent (mostly a city view) and it's nice to have a large balcony. The best part of the hotel though is the location.

(Very minor, but don't promise if you can't deliver!)There was a lot of building renovation going on in the front entrance, which was very noisy and started early in a morning, you couldn't hear a thing when walking through the lobby! This was a let down as there was a small cafe in the lobby but I couldn't see them doing much business because of the noise. We were on the 31st floor, not good if you suffer from vertigo!!! But the views were amazing.There was a small shop on the 6th floor which had loads of essentials. We didn't use the pool, but it looked nice and clean, this was also on floor 6 along with a small fitness centre.We did use the laundry, which was a total rob! It costs $5 to buy a swipe card, then you have to top it up with a minimum of $10 to be able to do any washing or drying! We didn't realise this until we had already bought the card but hey-ho, you live and learn. It made for a very expensive wash and dry.The room was quite pokey with old fashioned dark green carpet which was a bit threadbare and dark olive green walls and a bath room which was no more than 5ftx7ft with a shower which was so small we had to bend down to use it (me and husband are both 6ft+) not brilliant for a family of 4 really. There was a tiny sink and fridge in the 'kitchen' which was no more than a worktop really, but it was handy for keeping the water bottles in.The A/C was very noisy so we had to switch it off at night and leave the door onto the balcony wide open instead.The location was it's saving grace as it was only a 5 minute walk from Waikiki beach and the shops. Lots and lots of very expensive shops to walk around and the beach was amazing, but we wouldn't go to this hotel again unless it had a serious makeover and upgrade.A bit disappointing considering we spent so much.","Wakefield, United Kingdom","Liz S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wakefield, United Kingdom</strong>",16,3.0

There were 4 adults, 2 teenagers and 1 pre-teen so we booked 2 rooms for 9 nights in a Studio Panoramic Ocean View room. We were on the 36th floor and the view was great. We faced Diamond Head and also easily viewed the beach and the waterway on the other side. The balcony was a good size. Unfortunately the coffee shop in the foyer was rarely open but the food market on the 5th floor was excellent. The bathroom was very small. You couldn't put the bathmat on the floor and open the door at the same time! The towels were of a good quality but the size was not what we had been used to in our other hotels. The rooms were very hot and the air conditioner was way too noisy. Ceiling fans would have been a better option because you could not say that the rooms were air conditioned when the air con was unusable. Bedding was comfortable and clean. Our major problem was that when the booking was made I stressed that we would be paying cash for both rooms. When we checked in, again I stressed that we would be paying cash. We were told that it would not be a problem but by the next day, upon checking our credit cards, we noticed that we had been charged on our cards. I pointed it out to the staff and he said that they would reverse the entry if we paid cash then which we did. The problem is that with the credit card conversion and fees we are out of pocket $114au for each room! The hotel sent us a survey when we arrived home asking about our stay and I pointed out the difference and the manager wrote back and said his staff had been made aware of the problem so that it didn't happen again but didn't help us in any way. We would not stay here again and our other family members who were considering this hotel have now changed their minds.

My faves were booked and I didn't want to spend a fortune on 2 rooms for 2 nights. I also knew it would be good to have a kitchenette and possibly a grill as the men going love to cook. Plus, we didn't want to be at the mercy of Waikiki restaurants if we wanted a snack.I Yelped all the Aqua's as I heard they are family friendly and reasonable. Some were ultra cheap and apparently for that reason. So when I came upon the Skylight, the reviews were good, the price reasonable (although all the service fees did add up) and yes they had a kitchen and grill. Perfect.Check-in was easy. There is a security area that I initially thought we check-in there, but alas, it's through another set of sliding doors. That was a tiny bit confusing. I rang the bell and was attended to promptly. One of the rooms was ready early so we checked in. I ended up extending a day and although the room I was in had owners coming in, there was another room available for me and even higher up. The room was wonderful and just as expected from Yelp pictures. The lanai's are much bigger than typical hotels. I was told out of the 400+ rooms, only 90 are rented out as the rest are owned. This would explain the pool area having a spacious amount of room with lots of tables for what I would assume are visitors/owners having parties. There were about 6 grills. The only downfall is that if it rained, there was no coverage. There are canopy lounge chairs but again, if it rained, you'd get wet. There is a small work out area (we didn't utilize) and small convenience store. No restaurant although there is a coffee cart next to the check in area. However, they are open only for a short time in the morning. There are free movie rentals from a box similar to Redbox also located where you check-in. Parking is steep with it being $25/day. You must inform the desk as they will charge you $30 without the parking slip. And the parking is not affiliated with the hotel. You pay the parking directly to the parking attendant.

We used Air BNB for our months stay and booked two rooms, one on the 18 th floor and the other on the 14 th floor.Views from both rooms were very different, one over the Ali Wai canal and the other over the hotel pool area and city, both enjoyable and relaxing.Loved the pool area, large pool, nice and deep, plenty of sun loungers and several day beds which you need to book through the security team which is on the lobby level as you exit the lifts.The pool area also has a large jacuzzi and adjacent to this area is a bank of Webber barbecues, which also need to be booked through the security desk. Enjoyed shopping at the local supermarkets for bbq meat and salad items, and found cooking in the evening a really enjoyable experience.The hotel is couple of blocks back from Kalakaua Avenue, but is within a easy 25 minute walk to Ala Moana Mall, the walk to the main strip of Kalakaua Avenue is about five minutes, so not a chore at all.Very peaceful looking out over the canal, always some water activity going on especially early morning, evenings and weekends, lots of outrigger canoes etc.The daily room tariff reflects the somewhat dated decor of the hotel complex, but we did not mind this at all, our rooms were clean, comfortable with a kitchen, good sized lanai, main area indoors consisting of a queen size bed and couch which also doubles as a extra bed, bathroom perfect for our needs.There is a shop on the 6 th floor as you exit the lifts, recycling bins here for glass, plastic and aluminium, and a good sized laundry. The hotel gym and sauna is also located on this floor nearby.Rubbish shute at the end of each corridor is a easy way to get rid of rubbish from the room, each floor has this facility.For the price of the rooms that we had for our month, hotel is great, extra dollars to spend of clothing and the like, if you want to spend $600.00 a night, don't come here, far less than that by far, a comfortable and clean hotel with all amenities that we had hoped for.We would not hesitate to return, mahalo Olivier.","Mooloolaba, Australia","Gibbo23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mooloolaba, Australia</strong>",15,4.0

Once in front of the building the hotel staff told us that it was a false alarm and we should go back to our rooms. It took a while for all guests to use elevators to go back up to their rooms. Later I noticed that fire alarm handles in the hallways were taped up, which seems unsafe. I do not know how this lax safety standard can stand for a high rise hotel in the Waikiki area. Otherwise the hotel was 'average' in terms of its quality (small not-too-polished rooms, but nice balconies, good pool, nice location). Given that we were not exactly paying little (nearly $200 per night), I would not have stayed there if I would know how it will be. Overall, Honolulu is one big giant disappointment.

The guest pool and BBQ on the 6th floor was great! Also, the internet was decent (look for user name and passcode under the router in the room). The Free Shuttle to the Ala Moana Shopping Center leaves every 30 minutes and from there I took the City Bus 20 (you can also take the City Bus 19 as well) to the Honolulu International Airport for $2.50; good deal! Now the Bad News: This is a hotel, a residential condo and a rental. I was renting a very dated lodging...since the Aqua Skyline at Island Colony was built in 1977, I can safely say that my accommodations were not touched since then! My particular room, #3915 had stained bedding and towels, broken fixtures, an air conditioning unit that barely functioned, doors missing off the cabinets and an overwhelming Pine Sol smell hit you as you opened the door to the room. To make matters worse, although there is no smoking in the common areas, guests or residents smoked on the balcony/lanai, so if you have breathing issues (I have asthma) opening the windows (which whose latches were broken as well) was out of the question.Now here's the truth; I got a deal for this room, but I did note that the studio apartment next to mine was modern, clean and looked very inviting when the housekeeping staff were there to refresh it...so here's my advice BEWARE! Different owners who rent out these accommodations have different standards.

The Island Colony is wonderfully situated to all and the view from here over the canal is amazing,plus the buses.Admittedly the old Waikiki is virtuly gone but one can still find signs to explore especialy on The Bus which is just so good if you have the time, you can fill in any day just on the bus, the #14 Malalani Hgts is a must the view is great on the steep narrow roads, this bus leaves around 15 past the hour takes you near the Kahala Hilton Hotel a nice walk in to see the Dolphins have a swim and lunch close to the beach, on the top floor of the Hotel the view is great I do this every year, back on the bus to the Kahala Mall not big but a nice visit, the easiest way to plan this trip is just ring The Bus they are very good at explaining all. The Interntional Market place is no more but the new building will be lovely to wonder around if out of most peoples range. Outrigger West is now a Hilton and quite nice, it is still magic to walk along Kalakaua on the balmy nights,down by Queens Beach there is an eating place outdoors that have very good Fish and Chips plus other food also there on Tuesday Thursday & Sunday nights you can listen to the locals play and sing, real Hawaiian feeling. I personally can't believe how safe it is to walk out on the main drag at night when alone, I have done this solo for most of my time here and enjoy every moment just cruising. Also walk along the beach at night, go through the hotels just to look see the beach ones are lovely. Lots of people complain about what is happening, just forget that and look beyond,walk on from the Police Station along the promenade and enjoy the thrill of being in Waikiki, the days at the beach are simply gorgeous.Lots of nice places to eat so enjoy.

The bathroom was designed for disabled guests, which is great if you are disabled but we are not so, the hand held shower was too low so it had to be held by hand during the whole time in the shower, and there was no where to place our usual bathroom cosmetics apart from on top of the toilet, not ideal. But the main problem was the noise - The air-conditioner is ancient, and when turned on it sounds like a truck driving through the room, so to allow some cool air the only choice was to open the sliding door to the balcony & the problem with that is that being on the 38th floor you hear all the noise of the city rising up, there seems to be a lot of police and ambulances around at night!

Located on the 43rd floor it has one of the best views of diamond head from waikiki. The building has some of the fastest elevators I've ever been on which I found impressive. They have 4 elevators to service the many residents and tourists, and usually you won't spend more then 1 min waiting for an elevator unlike some other hotels I've been to. I hate waiting for elevators. There is a pool, and hot tub located on the 6th floor. As well as a convenience store, bbq's and picnic tables, and coin operated laundry facilities(you can also use a credit card). I would avoid the convenience store unless there is something you actually need or can't get it from somewhere else. As you will end up paying more for the convenience. This is a non smoking building but there is a smoking area located just out front. Left of the entrance if your looking at the building from outside. They also provide a free honolulu star newspaper to everyone, which you can grab from the stack on the front desk. I can't really comment on the rooms since my rental was through a private owner but ours was about the size of a bachelor pad and had a nice sized balcony(big enough to accommodate 8 people comfortably) overlooking the east side with a perfect view of diamond head. I'd say once you get past the 38th floor you start getting an unobstructed view. This is a great place to stay and every year I come, I book this hotel. It's only a couple blocks away from waikiki beach. Conveniently located close to bus stops, shopping centers, restaurants and bars, and a food pantry grocery store. I would recommend going to Don Quijote's and Walmart for groceries though(about 20-25m walk). ","Calgary, Canada","29zombies</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",18,5.0

The maid makes the bed and straightens the bathroom towels. That's it. My husband and I are very neat people. We cleaned the stove and sink every time we used it. But we didn't have the equipment to vacuum the crumbs or wash the floors. When walking barefoot, I could feel the sand that we brought in from the beach the day before, still on the floor near the bathroom. One evening I saw a cockroach walking along the counter top. The next morning I went to the reception desk to complain. The man asked me what specifically I want done in the room. I replied that I don't require anything special, I just want the maid to do what maids usually do. Then, at that moment, to prove my point, a roach walked across the reception desk!!

I decided I didn't want to spend that much money for 2 nights only. Went online and found decent review and price for this hotel and decided to book it. I was not expecting anything fancy or nice as I knew it was not on the main strip of Waikiki. The hotel has an interesting layout, including the bathroom has its own window inside the room. The bathroom is very cramped and small. Overall, it was easy to get in and out of the hotel in terms of getting to places I needed to go.

Once my flight came in I took a cab to the hotel, and I loved the lobby! It was open to outside, and my room was ready two hours early, so they let me check in right away which was perfect. I got to my room and it was so clean and bright, and spacious for what I was expecting! It was a lot better than the Aqua Bamboo rooms, which were small and very dark. The rooms kind of aura just gave so much natural light and the brightness just made you always feel happy! And the lanai was huuuuuge! The Aqua Bamboo lanai was small but there was two of them, Aqua Skyline only had one but it definitely made up for in size. I had breakfast out there every day! And the view was crazy beautiful. If you look to the right you see the canal and mountains, and to the left was the ocean. I can't praise it enough for the views. The parking was also a lot more easier to get into than the Aqua Bamboo's parking lot! This one was a lot bigger and had a lot more room to it. It was better too because you paid for parking after you left the parking lot, so say you only parked there for half the day, you don't have to pay the full 25$ parking for the day, my boyfriend only ended up paying like 7-12$ most of the time! I really really liked the hotel, the people that worked there were very kind and got me a taxi right away when I needed one. The housekeeping lady was very very sweet too. It was very welcoming and definitely the best time I've ever had in Oahu. It's literally an 8 min walk to Waikiki beach too, it's a couple blocks away and it's a really nice walk there. I kind of liked the short walk too instead of being right right there, it was nice to see Waikiki! The only tiny downside I would say about the hotel is that the elevators take forever to get up! Because there's so many floors and so many stops that people make on the way up and down, you could end up waiting for the elevator for over five min. Not that big of a deal though! And it was forever away from Schofield, not that that's the hotel's fault lol, just a bummer to me. For the price of the hotel, I think it is way under priced and definitely beyond worth your money. And not to mention it saves you a few bucks compared to the Aqua Bamboo, and it is a lot nicer in my opinion! I don't think this hotel deserves any bad reviews! Loved my stay!

I booked a 2 queen bed, on the high floor with panoramic ocean view i was told 36 floor and up. Paid for it in full before flying to HI. Checked in, our room is ""having a plumbing issue"" really did not believe it for a second, the front desk was very nice, has this wide smile on her face, offered me 2 options, they are basically upgrading us to a bigger room, but without the ocean view, we took it, as it is too late at night to argue, and it looks like we do not have any other options. Went to that room, unpacked, the phone rang. we have to move out of that room on our last night, apparently they double book it. I remained calm, it was still the same lady that help me at check in, offered me 2 days worth of (resort) fees which is $30, i said i want 2 days of parking ($50) for me to pack and unpack again, we have 4 luggage, i have 2 small children under the age of 6, i was a tired mother who works full time lol. Anyway, the night before we were to move to the other room, i started packing, packed everything. My huband got a trolly to move our stuff. The phone rang, it was the front desk saying we can now stay in that room. I thought my eyes where going to pop out of my head LOL i was not happy. I took the phone and said that i need to vent, i mentioned that i spent the last 2 hours packing, now for nothing since we are not moving anymore. The front desk apologize, i said i want to keep my $50 refund, they said they will give us $60. Although i would have preffered not to get the $60 refund and to just have the room we originally booked. We think that their booking system is not very effective. Not sure if i will be back. Theres all sorts of arrangement in this hotel, some people owns a suit, some rents, some parts are hotel, try to figure booking all that, good luck. Other Issues we had:You can hear the vehicles on the road, we were on the 14th floor. The bathrooms are really small. About 7ft x 7ft.Only 1 mirror available if you need to put on make up or do your hair.The hallways need a major face lift. Kind of creepy.Getting out of the parking is crazy, they do manual check in check out at the parking. No machines. Took us 10 minutes to get out. Insane.Shuttle is not reliable.

The location is really good and within walking distance of anything you want to do in Waikiki. The room itself had a bad odor when we first entered -- it was as if someone with bad body odor had staid in the room before us. We kept the sliding door open to air the room out. The studio had a twin bed, full size bed and futon, along with a table, but there was still enough room to maneuver. Also, the kitchen was very minimal -- two burners (no oven) and a very small sink, mini fridge and microwave. Our bathroom was of medium size and I have no complaints about it as per other TA reviews. The room faced the front of the building and overlooked the canal, so really no view to speak of. However, I enjoyed sitting on the patio each morning to take in the warm air. Being in Waikiki, I didn't intend to spend much time in my room, so it was acceptable. I'm very glad that we didn't rent a car for this portion of our trip, as you can get around by foot or bus quite easily. Pros: On-site convenience store that sells beer and alcohol, as well as medicine; liked the pool and hot tub; Enterprise rental car is at street level if you need a car for a day; close to many bus routes; and overall good location to explore Waikiki.

But would I stay here again - short answer, no.The good - Location wise, it's not too bad. While a 10 to 12 min walk from Waikiki beach itself, the's pretty centrally located on the Waikiki strip. It always seemed to be the same 10 to 12 min walk to either end of Waikiki (as in it took the same time to walk to Hilton Village end from this hotel as it did to walk to the Moana Surfrider end). Straight down the road (Seaside Ave) is the Royal Hawaiian Mall along with all the shops you'd want to visit like H&M, Sephora and the DFS Duty Free mall. The room itself was nice enough for this price range, actually surprisingly well appointed. Bed was comfy, bathroom was reasonable (apart from shower, see below) and cable TV with reasonable selection of channels. They also have included movie rentals and a small selection of PS3 games should the rain be unrelenting (if you paid the hospitality fee which was included when I booked anyway). Parking is, in my research, on the cheaper end for Waikiki hotels ($25/day when you get a slip from reception upon check in). Although, strangely, the sign outside the parking lot said $30/day with the slip, so I'm guessing the $25/day could be increasing in the near future - just make sure you check if this is an important part of your planning. Parking is unlimited entry and exit - a big plus AND I never had a problem finding a space - it seems to have enough capacity for now. The view was also very nice from the 34th floor. Their pool and pool deck area is nice with BBQs and tables. There's a minimart open from 8am to midnight which is handy - they sell cup ramen, snacks, drinks (including alcoholic drinks), basic household items, sanitary products and basic first aid stuff along with sunscreen. Other residents there seem friendly and respectful. Free wifi in room - although it didn't work, I couldn't be bothered calling reception as I just plugged in my travel router to their router and it worked. Internet was fast enough for me! Room rates were very reasonable and competitive - but read the bad points before deciding!The bad - Noise. We had to sleep with earplugs. Street noise even on the 34th floor was unbearable especially on Friday and Saturday - emergency services and stupidly loud motorbikes. Why - the room has glass louvers that don't seal closed. Also the air conditioner seems to be a cheap box window type. How loud is the air con unit alone? 67db, not at the unit, but at the bed! 71db at the unit itself. 67db is the same noise level as having someone talking to you according to OSHA. If you can't sleep with someone talking to you all night long - then good luck. Housekeeping was inconsistent in giving us the amenities, some days no shampoo or shower gel, other days no lotion or hair conditioner. Seriously?? I even left the empty tubes out so you'd get the hint! Ants - not many, but there was a minor trail that never went away even after their attempts at cleaning. Yes, they didn't directly bother me too much, but it is an indicator of quality overall. Shower was tiny and very low. I'm 5'7"" and I just fit under it. Hope to tilt the shower head to accommodate a taller person, nope, sorry no luck. It's a water saving rain shower. Tilting it does nothing.Overall, I'd stay elsewhere even if it did cost more. Accommodation was okay. Staff were nice though and they do supply beach towels and (heavy) beach chairs. Noise level and housekeeping consistency was a big let down. There's lots of improvement to be made and might I add, I think a small amount of investment would improve the quality of this place significantly.","Brisbane, Australia","enjoychewy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",74,3.0

This is actually not a hotel, it a condo building with a few rooms being managed as a hotel, but it still has all the amenities of a typical hotel.Just a heads up for people planning on booking this hotel. There is a resort fee of $15 USD per night that has to be paid up front when checking into the hotel. They also charge for parking which is $25 which can be paid daily or you can pay for the total cost upfront, the first time you exit the parkade. We booked a room with 2 queen beds and kitchenette. When booking, we requested a room on a high floor, which we got (22nd floor). The rooms were clean, and recently renovated. The kitchen was stocked with cookware (a pot and pan) and plates, bowls, utensil and mugs. The room also had it's own wireless router but the speed were erratic (sometimes 11 mbps download, other times 0.4 mbps download). There were times where the internet was so slow, I had to use data on my phone. A PS3 was available in room, where you can use it to play DVDs or games which you can rent from the machine on in the lobby. I did not rent anything because the movies and games available were not that great (same games/movies you would find in the $4.99 bin at Walmart). I brought my own Chromecast so I could stream Youtube and Netflix to the TV.We liked the fact that this hotel had a large lanai with 2 chairs and table. Our biggest gripe about the hotel is that there is a motion sensor and a door sensor for the air conditioner. The door sensor is placed on the lanai sliding door and if the door is kept ajar, then the air conditioner would shut off. This is understandable, but the motion sensor would shut off the air conditioner if it did not sense any motion in a given period of time. On the first night, we did not know about this and family woke up, drenched in sweat to find the air conditioner has switched off some time ago. The nights afterward, we had to wave our arms and legs periodically to trigger the motion sensor and keep the air conditioner on. Also the shower head in the bathroom is not designed for tall people. I am 6ft and my head hit the shower head so I had to slouch in order to shower.Other than that, I would recommend this hotel since it is so close to the beach (5 min walk) and to Kalakaua Avenue, the staff are nice and helpful, the hotel is reasonably clean.","Calgary, Canada","Andrew H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",12,4.0

Oahu was the first stop on a two island trip. We looked at other reviews on Trip advisor and decided to book a one bedroom suite through the hotel. When we first walked into our room it was very hot in the living room. We looked around for an AC but didnt see one. We looked around and we were shocked to find that there was only 1 air conditioner unit in the bedroom. The bedroom is to the back of the room seperated by a long hallway and it would take about 2 hours to cool down. We called down to the front desk and they told us that none of their one bedroom suites have air conditioners in the living room but we can give you a fan. A FAN?!! Any customer booking a one bedroom suite at any hotel would expect an A.C at minimum in each room or better yet central air. The unit in the bedroom is a plug in unit that also required someone from maintenance to come and empty water from a bucket on the balcony everyday! (See attached pics).The hotel says it's remodeled and that is true but don't be fooled into thinking that you are getting something better if you book a one bedroom suite. Another thing to mention is that the air conditioner automatically cuts off if you open the door on the balcony or if you leave the room. Everytime you come back to your room from being out in the hot sun all day you come back to a scorching hot room that takes 2 hours minimum to cool down.It was just me and my husband but if you were a family of 4 and you had to stay in a hot living room for close to a week that would be one horrible trip! There were some pros-the room was clean,housekeeping was very friendly, and the staff I did speak to at the front desk was friendly. Overall, this hotel needs to be more clear about what they are offering when you upgrade to a one bedroom suite. Don't boast that the rooms are newly remodeled but not mention that there isnt any air conditioning in both rooms of a 1 bedroom suite. This is my first review on but I felt compelled to let others know about this issue so they wouldn't be suckered into the mess we're in right now. Thank God we're on our way to stay at the Westin in Maui otherwise this trip would have been a bust!","New York City, New York","mhobgood</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",13,2.0

It has decent, fresh and clean rooms with amazing lanais, a kitchenette and a nice bathroom. The garbage chute outside our door worried me a bit, but once the door is closed there was no problem, although I would suggest some kind of air freshening system in the halls. The pool area is huge and very, very nice. There are grills and cabanas available free of charge, and a hot tub as well. This hotel also boasts a large laundry area and a small cafe and a convenience store. Parking, as anywhere in the city, is pricey, but at $25, it's not too bad, plus you have in and out privileges.

This time we opted for a hotel that was more for a family and a little closer to the main avenue. Aqua Skyline fit this exactly. Most of the hotel is occupied by permanent residents, mostly students. We were in one of the rooms facing the pool and a side view out to the mountains. Even though the building is the tallest in Waikiki, we found (after actually checking them out), unless you are in the top rooms facing Diamond Head, you won't get a great view. Only the top floor offers that as so many buildings block the view of the floors below so we preferred to stay on our 8th floor room, overlooking the pool area. The room was perfect for us with a small kitchenette so we could have breakfast in the room without having to be up and ready by a certain time - it was a holiday so a couple of days to sleep late was good. There was a HUGE balcony. We sat out there most mornings and had breakfast. Used it to sit out and have dinner on a few nights too after using the hotel's bbq facilities. The pool, hot tub and sundeck were all great and we used them several times. Generally just a handful of people around and sometimes we had it all to ourselves. The hotel was VERY conveniently located. Just a few minutes walk from Kalakaua Ave so we were close to everything we needed. Absolute perfect location. The hotel's front desk staff were so friendly and accomodating. 100% service whenever we asked for anything. We used the concierge desk to organise car rental on two occasions and that also worked well. Numerous lifts so you never had to wait long. Most of the hotel had recently had a makeover and our room was spotlessly clean, fresh and modern. Beds were oh so comfy with great linen and pillows. We really couldn't have asked for more, but they provided it anyway - free hotel shuttle all over Waikiki!! That saved us SO much money. We didn't have to use the trolley at all. If we weren't walking somewhere, we had the use of the free shuttle. Last pick up was around 9.30pm. Great for going back & forth to Ala Moana, down to the beach at HHV and my husband even used it to get to the trail for the Diamond Head hike. It pretty much did a circuit and had different pick up locations. There was no pick up at Skyline so we just walked to the corner and waited at Aqua Wave. It really was a bonus. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit. The ONLY downside was that I neede the AC to beon during the night, but it was quite noisy and disturbed the kids. I think it was probably an older unit and did give out quite some noise even when we put it on low. Kept switching it on and off during the night as temp changed. Otherwise, couldn't recommend this hotel more.","Melbourne, Australia","ozmum3152</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",38,5.0

No issues here. This was my second and last stay at this property. Check in was smooth and we reserved two rooms with an airline package. Room standards differ between rooms as these are rental pool accomodations. Had Booked two rooms with an airline package as we travelled as a family b Staff here are pleasant and eager to please. Check in was smooth and timely. Room one was acceptable but worn despite us being told it had been ""renovated"". Room two was far from acceptable- dirty with foot prints on the walls and doors, small cramped bathroom with long black hairs on the tub walls, dust on baseboards that was permanent and just plain in need of a major cleaning. Linens did not look clean and were stained even though the beds were properly and recently made. Upon our insisting and after some confusion and delay the front desk moved us the next day. This second room was a nice clean updated room but after two nights of all of us waking with sore throats which disappeared after we left the room, I checked the AC and saw it was filled with black mold. This is something to consider for those who have allergies. The Island Colony from what I was told has 150 privately owned rooms in a rental pool, the remaining 700 or so rooms are owner occupied homes. This lends itself to a very different feel compared to a sole hotel vacation property. General freshness/cleanliness and room quality needs attention - and not by air fresheners. Housekeeping services are minimal but adequate. We had to notify the front desk to remove garbage in the hallway from a owner occupied room however this was promptly delt with. It is a 15 minute walk to the beach so something to consider for those wanting closer to the beach. In general this is a dated property, probably quite swanky when built in 1979. A thorough clean and some refurbishing to bring it up to today's current vacation standards would improve the appeal. The staff already represent the hotel favourably. Having a regulated standard for the rooms they rent and advertise as being renovated would be beneficial for those vacationing here to prevent any surprises. The photos advertised do not depict most of the rooms accurately which is why the reviews could vary.","Edmonton, Canada","Andrea J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",52,3.0

Check in was super quick and all the staff were very friendly any time we encountered them. We ended up on the top floor room 4407 (YMMV). The hotel is located at Island Colony which is a condo unit so there are hotel guests as well as residents in the building. There didn't seem to be any issue with the mix and it was quiet and the place was clean. Our room consisted of two beds, large flat screen tv, desk area, small kitchenette with basic utensils and settings for 4 and the bath. There was also a large balcony with a table and two chairs for eating since there wasn't a place to eat in the room. The breeze and views (and no bugs) made the balcony a perfect place to eat lunch when we were in the room and to eat dinner. The beds were very comfortable and the air conditioning worked great. Even though you are up so high, you can still occasionally hear the noises from below (sirens), but it wasn't too noisy and with the a/c on, you couldn't hear anything from outside. The place looked like it had been recently remodeled and the finishings had been upgraded. The bath was kind of odd though with a frosted window into the room for light. It wasn't a problem except for in the middle of the night if someone got up to use the restroom and turned the light on in the bathroom, it flooded the room with light as well. Also there is a bulkhead in the shower that prevents the rain shower head from being positioned at an appropriate height. I am 5'9"" and had to turn it sideways to be able to stand under it. Someone didn't do the math. We had 2 minor issues in the room and we called the front desk and maintenance came up right away to assist. Both times they were friendly, quick and attempted to rectify the issue. The hotel was supposed to have wi fi , but it was almost non existent. I don't know if it was a router issue or the wifi service itself, but we could not get anything to connect with any type of speed so we used our 4G instead the entire time. The hotel was advised with a follow up questionnaire and they advised it will be addressed. The pool and hot tub deck was huge and there seemed to be enough room for everyone that was using it while we were there. You can get pool/beach towels at the front desk so there is no need to take the room towels with you. The hotel also has a gym, sauna, and laundry facilities available. Parking was $25 a day in the garage and you need to let the front desk know so you get the discounted rate. The neighborhood is great being a couple blocks from Waikiki, but not in the tourist path and there is a grocery store about 3 blocks away to get essentials for the room and lots of restaurants and take away places close by. There is also a walking path along the canal side that is great for walking or jogging. Overall I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again and with a couple of tweaks this place could be a 5 instead of a 4.","Tampa, Florida","tadjr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tampa, Florida</strong>",72,4.0

Based on the many good reviews and the cost it seemed like this hotel would be a great find for cost and location. My experience was with the hotel was terrible and if I could provide a lower rating I would. Upon arriving to my room I found that it was not cleaned very well at all. I had to call down to the front desk and request that cleaning supplies be brought to my room so I could wipe down the furniture and vacuum the floor. The maid service had obviously walked through the room, straightened out the bed and fluffed the pillows leaving dust, dirt and mess behind for the guest to deal with. I had really been looking forward to my escape to the sun so I put this behind me and got myself unpacked. It was very warm so I turned on the Air Conditioner when I arrived in the room and while unpacking was having a hard time breathing. I am allergic to dust and was astonished to find the filter on the in-window air conditioner had not been cleaned for a very long time based on the amount of dust and dirt that was on it. I was surprised any air could get through at all. Again I notified the front desk and washed the filter and replaced it in the unit. At this point I was getting frustrated and was surprised by the fact that the front desk staff and manager on duty did not seem to care about the fact that these things were going on. Another bump in the road was that the Wi-Fi in the room was not working. After calling they did send someone up to fix it and it did stay on and work for the rest of the stay. So dirty room, dirty filter on the AC unit that was crazy in the amount of crap on it and the Wi-Fi was not working all within 30 minutes of getting into my room. This room was definitely not customer ready as it should have been. The next day as of 1pm my room had still not been cleaned. I got ready to head out and locked my computer and iPad up in the safe. I later realized I left a white gold and black coral ring that I had gotten on a previous trip on the table in my room. Unfortunately when I returned the ring was no longer there. I spoke with the front desk and again and did not even get an apology. I took it on myself to call the police and they came to get a report. When the police were there we realized the door did not fully engage in locking when I left the room unless it had help and was either all the way open and slammed closed or was yanked from outside as I was leaving even though it looked secure. I spoke to the hotel manager who was surprised that any of this had taken place as his staff did not share any of it. This is shocking since I would think a theft of a guest would be something to be communicated and also followed up on. Again the manager fell short of an apology or trying to make any of this right just as he staff had done. I was contacted by Jessica Lani Rich of the Visitor Aloha Society of Hawaii and found them to be very supportive. They too were surprised by the lack of response from the hotel and followed up by calling them directly. I received a gift bag from the Visitor Aloha Society of Hawaii with a card which apologized for my experience and wanted to make sure I should return to the island. I was very touched that a group not connected with the hotel in any way took action to help me and try to make things right when the hotel could not even apologize for the events they were directly responsible for or the fact I was robbed in their hotel from my room when I was not there. I would definitely suggest avoiding this hotel.","Willoughby, Ohio","Ejay R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Willoughby, Ohio</strong>",32,1.0

My room was a good size with two queen beds, a small desk, a comfy chair, a large flat screen, and a medium size balcony with a table and two chairs that could easily fit two more chairs. There was the standard iron, ironing board and functioning room safe. The room had its own wifi router. The micro kitchenette was the most well appointed one I have ever had in a hotel room. It had the standard small fridge, and coffee maker but it also had a two burner electric stove top, toaster and full dish set for four people. The bathroom had been recently renovated and had new fixtures including a rainfall shower head, The staff was super friendly and helpful at all times. I forgot my watch and I arranged a fedex pickup to ship it to friends at another resort to bring it back for me. There is full laundry facilities on the 6th floor, as well as the tuck shop, pool and hot tub and I think sauna which I never used. If I have to list the bad points they seem relatively inconsequential. The hotel is a dual use hotel and condo bldg so occasional there are cooking odours in the hallway. My room happened to be beside the garbage chute so I occasionally heard garbage come down. The tub was a small four foot one so essentially this is really just a shower stall unless you have small children. The view from the room is unimpressive. Too far from the beach and mostly looking at other buildings but I was on a lower floor. The air conditioner is an old school window unit built into the wall and drains to a bucket on the balcony. The hotel is not on the beach but it is only a 10 minute walk away as is the shopping for those so inclined. Actually unless you like really crowded beaches rent a car and go to the north shore beaches. They are gorgeous and far less busy. All in all I was very impressed. It's not a 5 star resort but it gave me everything I needed including friendly staff for an inexpensive price.","Brampton, Canada","Brampton_Peter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brampton, Canada</strong>",9,4.0

Air conditioning is very noisy. We were fortunate that the following day, that we could change rooms.Rooms with king beds have a tiny bar fridge, while a room with two queen beds has a large fridge with a real freezer.The term kitchenettes should be used loosely at this accommodation. As for dining in-room, not going to happen, you have to eat on the balcony, that is quite large, with only two chairs and decently sized table.Note: this is a mixed use building that is also owner occupied, therefore people are permitted to smoke in their own units.And if you are unfortunate as we were, the neighbor next door was a heavy smoker, so if you left your balcony door open, then you got a good whiff of the smoke. And not the ordinary tobacco either. Should mention that we are all non-smokers, and some have allergies to tobacco and the funny tobacco as well .The difference between owner occupied units and that of those that are being rented out as a resort hotel, is that the owner occupied units have standard residential key lock on the doors, and the rental units have the electronic pass key locks.Internet, shuttle service, newspaper, etc., are not really complimentary, nor are the other services that they offer as complimentary. Those so called complimentary services are all covered by the additional $15+/night U.S. resort fee that they charge, that is payable on arrival.Another issue is that the front desk is manned by only one individual per shift, so it appears. Therefore when registering in the evenings, there can be a rather long wait time.As for the staff from the front desk, house keeping, maintenance, and shuttle drivers, they are very nice and friendly, and will do the best to assist even when short staffed.In other words, give these people a break, especially when there are numerous guests waiting for assistance.As for the management of this hotel, well, they will not even reply to e-mails directly addressed to them, nor will a representative from the Aqua chain respond to e-mails.High-speed internet is available as part of the mandatory resort fee, though unpredictable, from fast to snail pace.Bed linen changed every 3 days, and towels may be changed on a daily basis. Housekeeping will come around daily and freshen up the room. Housekeeping will not do the dishes, and the only dishwasher is your hands.There is a gym available onsite on the 6th floor, only for guests and residents, that will incur an additional one time fee of $5 U.S. in order to use the facility. The hotel is located on the canal, and is approximately a 10min walk to the beach. BBQ's and utensils are available for use on the terrace (6th floor), one large outdoor swimming pool and outdoor hot tub. Also on the 6th floor there is a small convenience store that is reasonably priced, when compared to those at street level in Waikiki.Local phone calls are complimentary.Limited choice of DVD rentals are available free of charge.Additional charge for parking and laundry facilities.Included is a shuttle service (capacity 13 guests) from the Aqua Hotel chain to Ala Moana Mall and return, whose schedule can be anywhere from every 30 minutes to over 2 hours or more for pickup. Officially the schedule is that when only one shuttle is in service - expect a wait time of 1 hour, if two shuttles are in service, the the wait time can be 30-45 minutes. From personal experience we have experienced a rather unreliable service, with unacceptable wait times regardless of the number of shuttles in service. The shuttle service can be overwhelmed on a daily basis as there are only two vehicles in service. And don't get upset with the drivers, if they are late, or indicate that the shuttle is full, that results in many a guest to be passed up on. It is beyond the control of the drivers, it is up to VIP Trans and Aqua Hotel chain management to increase shuttle capacity. VIP Trans is operating this shuttle service, and based on the reviews on tripadvisor to date regarding VIP Trans, the quality of the shuttle service is self-explanatory.There is a Weekly Manager's party (17:00 - 18:00) - no managers here (?), if so they did not identify themselves.Nachos, with cheese and crackers, spiked punch, rooftop view is quite impressive. Unfortunately they do not keep the roof top open so that you can view the sunsets. This weekly Managers Party is open to all guests and residents of this establishment.By the way if you have a late flight and require the use of a complimentary suite/room to change and freshen up - not here.Would we recommend this establishment: NoWould we return to this establishment: No, there are many hotels in the area within the same price range (including resort fee) that do not charge a resort fee, with the same or better services.","Toronto, Canada","Divevoyager</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",262,2.0

The room was spacious and clean with a well appointed kitchenette. There is a small grocery store on the 6th floor, but if you really want a variety, hit any of the nearby ABC stores or Food Pantry. There is a coffee shop (Jagger's) in the open air lobby but it was closed the entire weekend. When we left Tuesday, it was the first time I'd seen it open. We called the hotel directly and got a much lower rate that posted on any travel site. Many of the rooms are actually condos , so the feel is more community, less transient.

We booked a deluxe ocean view studio and when we checked in, we were ""upgraded"" for free to a 1 bedroom. Our room was on the 28th floor and the living room faced the ocean, but with so many other buildings in the way that you could only see little peeks between buildings. The bedroom with lanai faced diamond head (but again, only peeks of it between buildings) and we could see the canal well from the lanai. Wifi only worked in living room, not bedroom or lanai, which was a bummer. The room was clean and relatively newly updated but somehow felt dirty, which I suspect was due to the mediocre workmanship of the remodel (ripples in the carpet from it not being stretched correctly, floor tile unevenly laid and grout not sealed so it was brown in higher used paths instead of the original cream color found in outlying areas, dings in wall that were not patched before paint, etc). It felt a lot like my first apartment in college. Front desk was great and very helpful and responsive with issues, maid service was very thorough each day and security at elevators was helpful in locating the closest grocery store (Food Pantry on Kuhio, 2-3 blocks away). The building is mostly condos, many of which seem to be rented out as well, and there are a diversity of languages being spoken on the elevators. The parking garage is tight and the garage attendants were rather confusing about how the in/out privileges worked (it seemed to change with each shift). Parking is $25/day.We slept with windows open and it was very noisy, but I suspect that would be the case pretty much anywhere in Waikiki - buses, trash trucks, drunk people hollering on the streets, etc. It definitely sounded like we were in a large city. Waikiki wouldn't be my first choice of places to stay in Hawaii if we weren't here for business - all the locals kept telling us to stay on the island of Kauai or the north shore of Oahu, both of which are much lusher. Waikiki is mostly concrete and buildings and throngs of people on a small beach and lots of stores.","Tacoma, WA","CommencementBay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tacoma, WA</strong>",18,3.0

I'll start off by noting that if you are wanting a vacation resort right on the beach, this is not that place. However, if you want a comfortable place to sleep, with great views and a nice pool area, along with good service, then this is a very good option. When our friends come to Honolulu, they are usually not looking to stay inside a resort their entire time---they will often go to other islands for that. In Honolulu, they want to take advantage of the beaches, the restaurants, the museums, the historical sites, and the shopping...while having a nice hotel to return to for a good night's sleep. If that's on your agenda, too, then you'll like this hotel. First, both times we've stayed here, the rooms were very convenient, with a small kitchenette, coffeemaker, and coffee that was replenished daily. The kitchenette had a fridge, electric burners, and a microwave, so if you feel like cooking, you can do so. Secondly, the lanai (balcony) was spacious, allowing five adults to comfortably sit outside and watch the New Year's fireworks. Thirdly, the location really can't be beat. A higher floor room will have views of both the ocean and the Ala Wai canal, along with the Honolulu skyline and beautiful mountains. In this hotel, you are right along the Ala Wai, which is a lovely place to go for a morning or evening jog. You are three short blocks from Waikiki beach. You are a five minute walk (or less) to downtown Waikiki's wonderful restaurants. You are only two miles from Ala Moana shopping center. And finally, the hotel itself is nice. The room was comfortable and quite spacious for Waikiki. (The bathrooms are very small, but they are serviceable, and the showers have good water pressure.) The convenience store on the sixth floor has a wide assortment of things you might need for your stay. The pool area has been renovated, and it is really a nice pool, with a large hot tub and lots of lounge chairs in which you can relax. Even over Christmas, there were enough lounge chairs for everyone. The sauna is small, but it is clean and works very well. The gym is also small, but again, very serviceable, with enough cardio and weight machines to allow you to get a complete workout. If you need laundry services, there is a laundry area on the sixth floor, and the machines there take credit cards, so you don't even need to find quarters to do laundry. The staff is very friendly and helpful. I've now stayed here twice, and I would gladly do so again.","Honolulu, Hawaii USA","AEKBS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii USA</strong>",72,4.0

This hotel is a mix of rooms, condos, and live in apartments. There are some permanent residents. It is a very tall building and we had a room up high on the 37th floor with an astounding view of Diamond Head, the canal, and the ocean. We loved waking up to the sun beaming in through the sliding doors in the early morning, however they do have black out curtains if you want to sleep in. The room had a small kitchen area with small fridge, 2 burner glass top stove, and microwave with some attractive cabinets and granite counters, which is well equipped with dishes, pans cutlery etc. The sink was located inside the washroom though, so you were brushing your teeth in the same sink you did your dishes. It was awesome though to have a place to cook an occasional light meal to save money from going out every night. And to be able to have our fruit and toast and kona coffee on our lanai gazing at Diamond Head in the glorious sun was a dream come true. We could even watch the surfers and whales! The hotel is located about 3 blocks from Kalakaua ave. and all the fancy stores for shopping, delicious restaurants like Dukes and of course iconic Waikiki Beach. The hotel also has a very nice swimming pool on the 6th floor with washrooms and change rooms and showers. There are screened areas also to lay or sit in if the sun is too hot. There are lots of loungers for sunbathing. There is also a very well stocked store on this level with all sorts of items, both food and pharmacy and souveniers and their prices are very reasonable. The beds are very very comfortable, the room is very modern in design with some nice decorating touches. The trouble we had with our wifi at first was taken care of immediately. The area seems to be undergoing a refurbishment, and while there is still the occasional sketchy shop on the way to Kalakaua, we always felt very safe walking whether day or night. There is a little bar The Seaside Grill, one block down that does not look great from the outside, but the drinks are very good, the staff was awesome, and the garlic shrimp lunch plates we had were amazing!! we got the to go a couple of times to have back at the pool.

Really? I've stayed there for as low as $110/night!), I decided to try something different. I took the chance to splurge a little for the supposed added value of Aqua Skyline's big rooms and kitchenettes.The hotel is not that close to the beach. I am a pretty fast walker and it took me 10 minutes to get to the beach. Not a problem for me as I'd rather stay near the canal and away from the craziness of the beach, but others expecting to be super close to the beach may want to look elsewhere.The room itself was beautiful, very modern with a perfect size shower/bath combo (I think designed for the Japanese tourist in mind, which was great because I am only 5'6""). The kitchenette was great with an induction cooktop, sink, fridge and microwave. Having the kitchen handy was helpful as I was able to cook breakfast and dinner some nights, saving $$$. A/C worked well. Perhaps my favorite feature of the room was the balcony facing Ala Wai canal and the mountains. It was great for watching sunsets!Negatives:- I'm not convinced the $15/day ""resort fee"" is worth it. I realize the property is bigger, with quite a few amenities, but I've seen several of these amenities offered at hotels without a resort fee.- Bed was just slightly uncomfortable.- The TV with digital cable had about one gazillion channels but the room did not have a channel guide. - I was traveling alone, so this didn't impact me per se... But as I live with someone who has a physical disability back at home, I couldn't help but notice that the bathroom did not have any accessibility features like an anti-slip mat or surface in the tub, grab bars on the shower walls etc. I've noticed this at other Aqua properties and will continue to point it out until it is fixed. Suggestion:-Aqua should establish a frequent stay program! I stay at Aqua hotels 7-14 nights a year. Obviously I love the chain but would love it more if there was some sort of frequent stay/incentive program.All in all I really like Aqua Skyline but probably won't stay there again due to the overall higher room cost and hospitality fee compared to Aqua Pearl or Aqua Aloha Surf (at normal room rates). For my needs, it's not quite worth it.","Seattle, WA","Laura W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, WA</strong>",8,4.0

This hotel is situated on seaside avenue which is really convenient to Waikiki and down town Honolulu. If you keep walking south (towards Waikiki), it's where all the action is. The beach was a nice 10 minute walk. It's also located near many other busy avenues with tonnes of shops and cute little restaurants. The staff were friendly; the hotel room itself was very clean and nicely renovated and new. I believe they are all equipped with a kitchenette so that helped us out a lot. We were able to cook breakfast all week instead of going out to eat. Our only downside was that we were located right beside the trash chute (we could have request to move but didn't want to go through the hassel and the rooms were all fully booked) and the smell of rubbish would occasionally be known. Other than that, the room was fantastic. We were facing the east side, so we could see the mountains and the Ala Wai canal and part of the Diamond Head Crater. The hotel hallways are in need of a face lift; parts of the hotel are pretty dated. Great that the rooms were renovated first. As a heads up for those of you who will be renting cars while in O'ahu - parking is NOT free. They charged us $25 a day for the first five days until the last two days, they upped the price to $30 a day for hotel guests. They had a coupon for hotel guests for the full 7 days for a reduced rate of $25 a day. So beware - parking is not cheap!On the 6th floor, the pool is located there,along with a convenience store if you wish to purchase some quick items. We never went to it as there were so many ABC stores along Seaside! There's also a place for you to do laundry - you can also purchase small packets of laundry detergent.

Pay to upgrade your room, though. We were with a large group that had a total of four different rooms (different sizes, different views, etc) and we had the nicest room by far. The rooms are small, even the penthouse room (43rd floor) one of my family members had. Our room on the 19th floor was bigger than theirs (but their view was breathtaking). We had a 1-bedroom suite panoramic ocean room. My husband and I had the room with the lanai and our two preteen daughters slept on the hide-a-bed in the living room. Beds were very comfortable!! Even the hide-a-bed. The shower was very nice sized with a “rain shower” shower head that worked pretty good. We had a nice kitchenette with a full sized fridge, oven, microwave and sink (my brother’s room didn’t have a sink with their little kitchenette). It also had a nice granite island. Our room had built in a/c units in both the bedroom and the living room. Apparently most rooms do not come this way, so that was worth the upgrade right there. A majority of the rooms have an a/c unit through the balcony wall and there’s a bucket on the balcony that the water run off goes into. You have to call housekeeping to come and dispose of the water. A bit of a pain. Pool, hot tub and sunning area on the 6th floor were great! Probably the best part of the hotel! Though we spent time at the beach, the kids really enjoyed having the pool to swim in, too. We spent more time there than we thought we would. The laundry room on the 6th floor was convenient (and the washers and dryers actually worked well!). The BBQ area was nice for our large family dinners, but the hours to access it need to be extended (they kicked us out at 9pm). Having the little store on the 6th floor (hrs 7am-midnight) was very nice, as they had most everything you would be looking for, including alcohol, but it’s spendy, as you’d expect. There’s also a little coffee stand on the 1st floor that also serves sandwiches and snacks. Was expensive. The building itself was dated, but our room had clearly been updated in the recent years. It appeared as though they have been working to upgrade the rooms and were still in the midst of it. Hopefully they’ll be investing in updating some of their hallways, too. They were pretty worn down.The hotel has people that actually make it their home, hence the extra amenities like the laundry room and store. Was nice meeting different types of people who could also recommend places in the area.The front desk people were very friendly! So were most of the onsite staff. The security team, however, were extremely unfriendly to the point of rude. Just because you're security doesn't mean you necessarily have to be unpleasant. Unless you're dealing with people who are being unruly.The parking garage for the hotel was $25 a day to park in. Was a bummer, but basically a necessity if you rented a car, because there really wasn’t any free parking that we could find in the area. For people who are NOT staying in the hotel – they have to pay $35 a day to park in the garage! It was a rip off, but with no other options, what are you going to do?The surrounding area was busy, as you’d expect in Waikiki. Was easy to walk where you wanted to go whether it was the beach, one of their many varieties of restaurants or clubs. There were also places to shop, but they were all pretty expensive. I didn’t bother buying the cheap stuff, because we were going to visit Maui prior to going home and didn’t want to travel with all of our gifts until the end.Quick notes on restaurants: Went to Duke’s. WAY overpriced, but a beautiful view in of the ocean in the evening. You’re basically paying for that. If you can afford it, it’s nice. Marukame Udon is awesome food if you’re into Udon noodles! The line is long, but it actually goes faster than you’d think. Waited 25 minutes, but was worth it! Cafeteria style eating. Rainbow Drive-In is good local food, but is outside of Waikiki a little. You can walk there or it’s just a quick drive. Just past Rainbow Drive-In is an old bakery named Leonard’s Bakery. Get a box of Malasadas!! Again – There’s a line you’ll have to stand in, but once you take a bite out of the hot doughnut, you’ll forget about the line!Traffic on Oahu is horrid. If you need to travel anywhere on the highway system, give yourself double the estimated time! It’s a bummer to be stuck in your car creeping along at 25 mph on a highway while on vacation. We’ll probably stick to the other islands next time, but if you’re looking for a busy, crowded and fast past experience in Hawaii, Waikiki is the place for you!","Nine Mile Falls, Washington","TKColeman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nine Mile Falls, Washington</strong>",23,3.0

The front desk was always so helpful at all times and really treated me as i was very special over my entire stay.A special shout-out to Steve.Lelani, and a gentleman whose' name I just cannot remember- much less pronounce:-). He assisted me with a very late checkin as my flight from Dallas was almost 5 hours late. However I was totally thankful for all of the time they spent with me during a somewhat eventful checkin- again, thanks to Lelani and the mystery male agent who worked with her during my checkin- still cna't remember hiss name:-)Rooms were very clean and maids do excellent work! One special suggestion for all who may visit the Island Colony in the future, please checkout Jagger's Cafe which is located next to the front desk and is owned by a gentleman named Jason- No! Not THAT Jason of Friday the 13th fame- this one is the nice Jason:-) The menu is quite appealing and prices are very good. Pay him a visit and you will surely be pleased!Have stayed here many times and as aforementioned, will visit again-it's my favorite place to stay when on Oahu. By the way, their reservation agents are also excellent- the res agent who help me saved me quite a bit of money on the cost of my great room. Ok!

We arrived very late due to flight delays and I strongly suspect we'd been moved slowly down the floors as other people checked in ahead of us, c'est la vie. Our studio room on the 17th floor was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed for a short stay. The kitchenette was pretty tiny but had a microwave and stovetop. My tall boyfriend also complained about the chest height shower head and the water wasn't as warm as I would've expected in a hotel. The wifi got pretty slow in the evenings but early morning was good enough for a Skype call. Overall I think this is a good place to stay.

The front desk staff were courteous and speedy. There was no enthusiasm for their job.The negatives as I found them are the bed was a mattress on a board (no box spring), but it was not uncomfortable. My room was not at all like their ads claim. Cooking facilities were a sink and two-burner hotplate side by side - it was optimistically 30"" wide. No other counter-top or food preparation area. The electric coffee maker stands on the hot plate cooking surface! The bathroom had a stainless steel kitchen sink, not a bathroom wash basin, and was larger than the sink next to the cooking surface.

It is old and tired, and the brown plastic shelving with dusty ornaments for sale didn't help. The area for hanging garments was about 15"" wide and incorporated the iron and ironing board. It has a very noisy location because of the proximity to the main road next to the canal.","Vancouver, Canada","Rocheshunt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",33,2.0

I was surprised the it was only 2 stars, but that should have alerted me to what this place really was. I agree with another reviewer that the renovations looked like a brother in law did it. The renos felt like they were slapped together, and you could still get a sense of this being an older hotel. With a little more effort it could have been beautiful. The hallways are dingy and smelly. It just feels like there is no pride taken in the up keep of this place. The Aqua brand itself to me is not a trusted company. I stayed at another Aqua hotel for one night in Waikiki, and while the lobby was nicely updated and beautiful, the room was not. This is one time where the reviews on trip advisor let me down. I will never stay at an Aqua brand hotel, nor recommend one. The only plus side to this place was the impeccable customer service we received from the front desk staff.","Vancouver, Canada","Maria R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",11,1.0

I stayed in Waikiki in October and it was my first trip. Having had no guidance as to where to stay, I sought out TripAdvisor. Glad that I chose this hotel. All the staff (Front Desk & Houseekeeping) that we encountered during our stay was very kind, anticipated our needs, and always exceeded our expectations. The Front Desk representative acknowledged our special occasion and we were very appreciative of that. He even had a special amentity prepared for us. He made us feel like we were the only guests. Unfortunately the Front Desk representative moved from Aqua Skyline to their Lotus property, but what a great gain for them. The only downside was the elevators were a bit too slow during their peak times.The room offered the necessary accommodations. Small kitchen area, but was sufficient. Had to use the bathroom sink to clean up as that was the only sink in the room. The bathroom was just fine for us, but there were only 2 of us in the room. If we had a larger party, this may have been a bit small. The rest of the room was very spacious and the patio with table was an added plus. Great views!I would definitely stay here again.","Las Vegas, Nevada","Michelle M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",3,4.0

Room was clean and recently updated with a modern vs. tropical decor. Nice, wide lanai too on the 26th floor. The view was superb as this is the tallest hotel in Waikiki. The rooftop cocktail party on Tuesdays offers fantastic views. That's around 44 stories high! The service was very friendly from checkin to security. The hotel offers free wi-fi and free in-room safes, which were both important to us. Many hotels charge for use of the in-room safes but not this one. The only disappointment was the kitchenette area and the fact that the stainless steel bathroom sink is the only sink so we had to use it to wash dishes too. I would prefer a separate sink. So if I stayed here again I would probably spring for a full kitchen unit if it's affordable. There are also many Webber grills and picnic tables at the pool level, which would help with the cooking. Otherwise the kitchenette utensils and pots and pans were rather sparse--one frying pan and one medium pot. We had planned to do more cooking but the kitchenette was in the narrow entrance area so not much room to maneuver. Otherwise no complaints. Many units are privately owned but cannot be rented through the hotel. You would need to go to VRBO.com or Craig's list for those. The hotel itself is very nice and I'd stay here again.

Check in was a little slow as there was only one operating kiosk/desk that is outside near the tour sign ups and the small cafe downstairs. It was little painful to watch her operate in an inefficient set up (walking back and forth to the back room for the printer), in the humidity, but she was still very professional and upbeat just the same. Your room key is also a fob to access specific doors and the elevator.It looks like they're still finishing renovations in some of the common areas, but I think once it's done it will be beautiful. Unfortunately, the almost done phase of the renos gave me a sense that the previous state of the hotel was a dump, and I should watch my back. I don't know how else to explain it, other than I made sure to lock ALL of the locks as soon as I got in the room. I ended up with a studio kitchenette, which is plenty of room for two people -- two queen beds, a small but efficient kitchenette and a small bathroom, with a closet including a safe. The room decor is very modern, very sleek. The bed to me, was very hard, and I didn't sleep for more than a few hours at a time. The balcony is huge with a table and tow chairs making it a great way to enjoy breakfast, or to be breakfast for those pesky mosquitoes. I didn't use the kitchenette, but did see that one pot and one pan was available, along side the tiniest bottle of dish soap I've ever seen. Glasses and mugs are also provided and stored in the kitchenette cabinets. The bathroom sink is also your kitchen sink, and for this room I had, it looked like somebody cooked something and tried to clean their dishes, and somehow ended up splattering food up on the ceiling. Why that wasn't cleaned is beyond me because that was the first thing I saw walking into the bathroom. The shower head is a rain shower head, which made me very happy, but if you're taller than 5'5"" you probably won't like it as much as I did, because you'll have to squat... very low.The little stuff.... The soap and stuff came from Paya Organics, which is was really nice, except I had a used bottle of lotion in my room. This line is known for using papaya as their main ingredient, is eco friendly and organic based, and made in the USA. Safety first must be this chain's motto - there were four fire sprinklers in the studio. The decorations - candles and such - were pretty, but there is a reminder not to light the candles, and also if you are prone to stealing stuff from hotels, there is a charge list for you kleptos. I don't know the official name of the binder or book that is left in hotel rooms, but I can tell you Aqua does not skimp out on this little detail. It is a beautiful coffee table book, fully in color with a lot of great information in it, plus there are more magazines to provide you with things to do and see. Room service is based on a $8.95 fee, on top of the cost of your meals, operated by a third party. Or you can order super expensive pizza from Round Table, with a minimum of $20. The location is very close to restaurants, shops, crowds and more crowds at Waikiki beach, if that's what you're looking for. Sign ups for tours to local attractions is very convenient at the lobby area, next to the cafe. My view was of the ""city"" which really means I had people out on their balconies who could see me on my balcony, and I could creepily spy on people in the pool and jacuzzi area, located on the 6th floor. However, if I looked to the left, there was a nice small view of the Ala Wai canal.","LA, CA","funnymoney</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>LA, CA</strong>",60,4.0

It was our 25th anniversary, and so we knew that the location that we stayed needed to be truly special. We experienced firsthand the friendly embrace of the Aqua ohana as Amosa--the most friendly, charismatic, front desk receptionist--checked us into our room. We were truly blown away by his hospitality and welcoming attitude. And speaking of rooms, we were kindly upgraded to what must have been the best suite in the building. Every morning, we were graced with a sunrise view from the bedroom balcony. At night, we enjoyed the sunset from the living room window as we sipped on coffee brewed in the suite's kitchen. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the bathroom featured a modern waterfall showerhead.Now, as constructive feedback for the hotel, I must mention that the bathroom was slightly small in proportion to the rest of the suite. The elevators were somewhat hit-or-miss as far as wait times were concerned, but this comes with the territory of a 44-floor building.

Also a convenience store with reasonable prices is right on the premises. Walking to the beach took us 10 minutes and we had two kids in tow.

Harmless enough, but might disturb some folks.Wi-fi is only available in some suites, depends on the owner of your suite. They should make it mandatory for all owners to have wi-fi for all guest. We had wi-fi and it worked very well.The reno's…well…to fit in a kitchenette it was obvious they took space from the bathroom, however for the price it was great having a kitchenette for some meals.Also to be honest it looks like someone's brother-in-law did them. Carpet was bunching a bit in our room, tap too big for small kitchen sink etc. That said it did the job.If you aren't wanting to spend much and expect much, then this place will work.We enjoyed it…to a degree.","Vancouver, Canada","Rustproof</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",65,3.0

We’d stayed at the Aqua Park Shore a few times before but found since it’s been renovated the prices are on the upper side of what we wanted to pay (and really what it’s worth), so were pleased to find another Aqua hotel, the Skyline Colony Island with a great price.Over our 3 weeks we technically had 2 separate stays as we checked out to spend 2 nights at the Trump Waikiki for our wedding anniversary. For both stays we were able to check in early which was a great surprise, especially for our first stay when we arrived about 8.30am expecting to leave our bags and return around 2pm to check in (like at the Park Shore and other hotels we’ve stayed at). However we were pleasantly surprised that our room was ready and we were allowed in with wine and chocolates awaiting our arrival to celebrate our anniversary courtesy of the hotel.The hotel has recently undergone some renovations and the rooms do reflect this. They’re stylish and modern and larger than a regular hotel room in this price bracket. Pros• Large tv with cable and so many channels your thumb hurts just doing one round of channel changes checking what’s on• Large room for the price• Great views if you’re on the upper levels (our first room faced out to the sunset, the second room faced Diamond Head)• Quiet (with the exception of our second room which was on a lower floor so we could hear the garbage removal trucks early some morings)• Great location, close to the bus stop, shops and restaurants• Everything you could need on site (small grocery store, café, laundry, pool)• Kitchen is good and has all you need• Shower head is massive• Balcony with table and chairs• Great value for money• Staff are really friendly and niceCons• Sometimes we would have to close the balcony door due to smokers• Air con unit was a little loud (but you got used to it)TipsFood Barn around the corner is great for stocking your fridge to avoid the ABC store pricesGo to the Mangers reception which is on Tuesday evenings, it’s a great photo op if you’re on a lower floor as it’s on the roof and one of the best views of Honolulu (and there is free cocktails!)","Sydney, Australia","SydneyKate08</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",38,4.0

The view from our room on the 43rd floor gave us the perfect view of the fireworks at Magic Island (on the 4th of July) and of the fireworks at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (on Fridays). The hotel has a nice-sized pool/jacuzzi/recreation area on the 6th floor, this is where we spent the majority of our time - the kids loved swimming in the pool. Also on the 6th floor is a small store which is convenient. The location of the hotel was ideal for us - a short walking distance to the beach, the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center, and Kalakua Ave, but yet it was away from the noisier and busier streets. And lastly, the staff at the Aqua Skyline was helpful and curteous, especially the hotel manager, Mr. Kovaloff.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Kaile K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",1,5.0

I think we paid something like $130/night including all taxes, fees, etc. To be honest, before arriving, I was a little scared that it might be a ""you get what you pay for"" kind of experience. We arrived late at night, and our airport shuttle dropped us in the alley (more of an issue with the shuttle drivers than the hotel), so I was afraid my fears were being realized. However, once we were in the room, I was pleasantly surprised. The furnishings are updated and clean, even though you can see the traces of the older shell of the room (door fixtures, layers of paint). There is a kitchen area that provides dishes, pots and pans, a sink, microwave, coffee maker, etc. The room has an old fashioned wall/window type air conditioner that is quite noisy, so if you are a light sleeper or not used to such sounds, that may be an issue. Our room was not on one of the high levels (I think we were in the middle), so our view was not fantastic or of the ocean (overlooked the canal and golf course), but we didn't really care. It was high enough to be quiet! The bathroom is tiny, but manageable. So, there were a few small issues: the key cards kept becoming deactivated, which required multiple trips to the lobby; the concierge was less than friendly/helpful (isn't that his job?) but the front desk staff were very friendly; the lobby mysteriously smelled like garbage sometimes; our room was not cleaned one day; the A/C was noisy; the other rooms at our level were privately owned vacation rentals, which was kind of weird. They offer free replacement items (toothbrush, sewing kit, etc.), but when I asked for a sewing kit around 8:30 pm to fix an item of clothing that ripped, they said that housekeeping provides those items, and they had already left for the day. Overall, the issues were small and didn't make us regret our decision to stay at this hotel. However, it appears from other reviews that not all rooms at this hotel are created equal, and I can believe that. I think we were lucky.","Farmington, New Mexico","chuparosa412</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Farmington, New Mexico</strong>",46,4.0

We reserved 3 rooms. We were very unhappy with the experience for the following reasons:1) Pool & Jacuzzi were both SHUT DOWNa. We were not told of this to have the opportunity to potentially book at another locationb. No mention of this at check inc. We learned about this when we went to the pool itselfd. No options at other properties madee. In JUNE? In Hawaii? f. How could this NOT be a priority clean up2) We did not know this hotel was also a rental property so there are people who are NOT travelers mixed with guests – very odd and there were lots of very “different” types of people coming and going and intermingled with guests on floors. This gives unknown individuals access to guests. Extremely unsettling.3) The air conditioners are outdated and had BUCKETS which would fill with watera. The buckets overfilled and water was spread ALL OVER THE TILE BALCONYb. My adult son slipped and fell on his backside on the balconyc. The bucket in our room overfilled twice and required my husband to have to carry the bucket into the room, empty and replace. d. All buckets required the maids to emptye. NO ONE said anything when we checked in of this condition – WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WARNED. There are no signs or messages on the balcony or sliding glass door4) All the card keys for ALL the rooms kept demagnetizing, this required several trips. This is all unacceptable conditions and seems to be contrary to all the promises of the type of experience we were promised. We were very unhappy and wish that the Aqua Colony Skyline was not at all proactive in advising us to mitigate any of the above conditions. We could have moved and made other arrangements.

Our room was much nicer and more stylish than the old room we had last year. New mattresses were good. The room safe is included in the price at this hotel. Bathroom, while nice, is small. I would prefer my space in the main room, so a small bathroom is fine with me. The bathroom was all new except for the bath tub, but everything is nice, clean and new. The shower head is different, a big square ""rain"" type. It was nice, but I'm not going to put one in my house. The location is either good or bad depending what you want. It's as quiet as it gets in Waikiki, not too loud. It's a bit of a walk to the beach, but not bad. One block you are in the center of Waikiki. In room internet is new, was fast and all three of us used it at the same time with no issues. The one problem we had, and it seems to be common everywhere is getting enough towels. Check in we had three sets for three people. Some days we had two sets and had to call. Never got replacements for the kitchen towels. I know all I had to call to get more, but it got old after a while. It wasn't every day, but it was too often. That was my only complaint. (minor). The whole hotel is very nice, in a basic kind of way, not like a newer mega resort in Las Vegas. Was I glad to stay here: yes. Will I come back next year? Don't know. The price increases have been huge in the last few years and to be honest, Waikiki isn't as nice or as affordable as it used to be. But that is another issue.Prices are way up this year in Waikiki.

Misleading signs and not unintentionally.The parking costs 25$ per 24 hours and every time we got out the cashier tried to convince us to prepay for the entire period of our stay at that hotel. Why to prepay if you have the possibility to find free parking outside? What if you change your mind and leave earlier?In the lobby there are 2 computers but it's not free for guests. In the simplest motel it's free nowadays.The hotel is a renovated high rise, but cheaply renovated.We stayed in a suite where the living room's windows were far from being sealed. The wind entering the failed window seal was so noisy that in order to sleep we had to close curtains well, so that they stopped part of the wind from entering from the low quality windows. And the windows were ""closed"".The phone's red light in living room was flashing, but there were no instructions on the phone how to listen to the messages. We had to call the front desk and they told us to dial 55. We did so and listened to old messages that were left for former guests. Complete violation of former guests' privacy by that hotel.In the bedroom, the bed was so close to wall on one side, that I had to stick to wall in order to get in bed. There were only 31cm (12 inch) between bed and wall. On that side of the bed there is nothing : no lamp, no bedside chest, not even a shelf, nothing. The person sleeping in that side doesn't have even where to put the glasses, not to mention reading.The bed has a prominent frame all around it, which makes you get injured every time you get in or out of bed. Why do they put in such a small bedroom, where on one side there is only a 12 inches space between bed and wall, a bed with a prominent frame? Who is the genius that decided that poor decision?On bedroom's balcony there was no light at all - no light switch and no lamp.The phone in our bedroom didn't work.There is no clock radio in the suite ( basic item in the simplest motel in USA), so you cannot see what time it is at night.The bedroom's door was terribly squeaky. We couldn't close it at night because every time one of us opened it in order to go to bathroom, the terrible noise waked the other one. It took the maintenance service TWO DAYS to send somebody to grease the door hinge in less than 2 minutes.In the bathroom, the small shelf for soap above the tub was dirty and long dark hair was hanging from the tap.Above tub there is a shower with a ""forest rain"" head, but the water flaw pressure is weak, so all you can feel are scattered drops.In the wall between bedroom and bathroom there is a window, I can't see why. Every time one of us went to bathroom at night, the light from bathroom waked the other one - one more genius idea.Noisy ventilation system in bathroom.There was absolutely no place to put the cloths one takes off before taking a shower, no shelf and not even a hook.The hair drier was not hanging on the wall although it was made for hanging. It was just on a shelf under the sink and next to the sink there was not enough space for the whole appliance. So I had to take it out of the bathroom , to look for an electric outlet and to use it close to it in a completely uncomfortable way.The kitchen island's counter top was dirty.Noisy fridge.The hotel has trash chutes, one of the trash chutes' doors was next to our suite door and the stench was impossible and penetrated our suite.Waiting for the elevator took forever. There are only 4 elevators for that huge building, one of them was out of order during all our stay and nobody fixed it.The elevators are too small for the number of guests that have to use them and there is not enough room for luggage.Not only tourists stay at that hotel, all kinds of workers and persons actually live there and this hotel is definitely not a place for a woman alone to stay at.Among all TV channels, there was no weather channel - the most important TV channel for a tourist in Honolulu.We wasted 3 days of our vacation on getting angry, on conversations with the front desk staff and with the hotel's manager about the endless list of problems and inconveniences we encountered. And they take 325$ (!!!) per night for that outrageous hotel, no breakfast, no free parking, not even free computer for guests.Mr Brian K - the manager of that hotel, please do not thank me for taking the time to write that, I did it for future potential guests in order to warn them.And do me a favor, do not offer me to be your guest again.

I'm quite certain that all the rooms are not all being cleaned at the exact same time. That was the first dissapointment. The second dissapointment was that the pool was closed (I have a 12 year old child). The deal breaker was the room itself. The lanai was great, but couldn't get past the room itself. Just too old and dated. The paint was fresh, but there had been no updating to fixtures and such. So, after waiting for 3 hours and looking at 3 different rooms at Aqua Skyline, I scrambled to find us an acceptable room.

My wife & I were very impressed by the newly renovated room & bathroom, which was well styled, comfortable and spacious. Our room had all the amenities to make our stay comfortable: Coffee-machine/kettle, sofa couch, study table, electronic safe, iron, kitchen facilities (stove, pots & pans), laundry facilities and a veranda. From our room on the 24th floor, we had views of the Waikiki buildings & canal. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. At the price we paid we’d definitely stay at the Island Colony again.Pros:* New renovated rooms, kitchenette is great for eating in for breakfast or dinner (we get a bit sick of eating out everyday). Big comfortable bed.* Close to the main attractions on Waikiki beach (under 10mins) and to the shuttle/bus stops (about 5 mins). Being 2 blocks away from Waikiki beach also means that the food & shopping is slightly cheaper! * Convenience store on level 6 (items cost about 10-15% more than ABC stores, but it’s convenient) *Individual wifi router in our room (was able to connect 2 phones and 1 tablet to the internet )*Great value for the price we booked at.Cons:*Noise- as more of the building is being converted from condo to hotel rooms, renovation work is ongoing. Unfortunately for us the workers would start work in the room directly above us at 8:30am during weekday mornings, with their hammering, power tools and things being dropped onto the concrete floor. Not ideal for us when we wanted to sleep in. We raised this with the front desk and was offered a room change, though by that point we had spread all our shopping & belongings over the room, making it too difficult to move. I wished they would start renovation work later in the morning considering that it’s a hotel for people on vacation. *Housekeeping – was a bit average. They did the minimum which was to change the towels, empty bins and tidy the bedsheets. Some days, our coffee & sugar supplies were not replenished. There was also no sweeping/vacuuming done during our 9 day stay, and the floors were getting a bit dirty towards the end. *Parking is a tad bit expensive at $25 a day, compared to $20 a day at other hotels in the area.Tips: If you need to buy bulk groceries there is a large supermarket 2 blocks away (Food Pantry)",Sydney,"Simon_Reeves34</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",9,5.0

Tip 1: Try hotels.com & expedia daily to score opportunity rates that pop out once in a while (always good to refresh the offer - this one came up suddenly). We arrived in the morning & official check wasn't until 1500 hrs but we wanted to shower and hit the Arizona memorial at Pearl Harbor. So the nice lady at the desk offered to store our luggage and the shower and changing facilities. Tip 2: I asked whether there were any rooms available at the moment. She said there was one on the higher floor that was currently being cleaned, that we would have to wait for a while, which wasn't a problem - waited about 15 mins to get the room just below the 40th floor.Room was large enough for my family, loved the balcony but the toilet was a squeeze but sufficient given this price point -definitely still value for money. Near Waikiki Beach, International marketplace etc. Tip 3: Don't forget to visit Marukame Udon nearby for excellent udon (go early or at breakfast to avoid long lines) and the newly opened Ross just down the street. Tip 4: Ask when are the fireworks on Waikiki Beach and whether your room can see it. If you love a fireworks show, a high floor and the nice balcony would be beneficial. By the way, don't leave unsecured items to dry on the balcony - they may just be blown away.Loved the wifi too.

Location was good, close to shops and restaurants. Its a 10 min walk to Waikiki beach. Area is safe to walk around. Pay the parking in advance, will save you time every time you leave. Our room overlooked the pool (12th floor) it was quiet all day and night. Extra: We had a car so we would visit beaches around the entire island. You need a car, you'll miss way too much if you stay only in Waikiki. Hanauma bay was great for snorkelling. Hawaiian shark adventures tour was really cool, the sharks are peaceful! Diamond head was great, the hike worth it. I found it rough, but I need to hit the gym :( go early we started at 8, finished at 10, it was getting busy already. Went to a gun range, easier than I expected. Stop at the lookouts along the highways, good way to find nice beaches that you would have missed. Dole plantation was boring, but if you visit the area be sure to stop for a dolewhip ice cream with pineapple juice. Went to Polynesian center and luau for my bday. Food was ok, 2nd half of show was really good!!Be prepared to see lots of homeless people. I'm used to seeing this in Montreal but I was shocked by how many there were in Waikiki and surrounding areas.","Montreal, Canada","cuba_siiii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",1,3.0

Our room was on the 42nd floor, and had amazing views of both the beach and downtown; Diamond Head and Molokai were visible in the distance, and the sunrise and sunset from our spacious lanai was an added bonus. To top it off, despite being centrally located, we did not have difficulty with noise disturbance from traffic, other guests, or tourists in the area. Parking was available and affordable on several streets nearby, as well as within the hotel garage for a reasonable fee. Further, the hotel had various security measures in place to ensure that guests felt safe.

You get to the room and fiddle with the cards until the door opens. 15 minutes at leAst bad if u had a couple of drinks and/or need the bathroom.The hotels solution print more cards. They said they were awaiting for the locks to be fixed. Asked for another room but they would not accommodate finally met with the manager Mona and she was nice and apologized she said she would refund 1 night (out of 4 no bad). But she said i paid via agoda so she said she would refund via them. 6 months no refund! Called Agoda no idea what im talking about. Other than the hotel is OLD! Rooms have been refurbished and nice but lobby pool hallways look like they were 20 years ago (i know because i stayed there twenty years ago - reading on their website remodeled thought be fun to stay there!). But it is only the rooms with broken door locks which have been remodeled.10 15 minute walk to the beach.I would've recommended if trying to save money but the manager promising a refund and not delivering left a bad taste in my mouth. ,"Vancouver, Canada","Michael A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",13,1.0

All the rooms have been renovated with modern touches and I believe there are plans to upgrade the common areas soon .. we enjoyed our stay here, no complaints whatsoever ..",Seattle,"travelmusings</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle</strong>",36,4.0

We were placed in room 2412 and was disappointed. No one can hardly call a glimpse of the ocean a panaromic ocean view. The room however was clean and functional. The beds were good enough to sleep in and spacious lanai. The bathroom is a different story. It was quite small and if you are taller then 5'6 it would be hard to take a shower. It is in a good location and within walking distance to all the shops. The elevators are quite slow and you never know which one will be opening up. I would recommend if you're only staying a short while like we did which was overnight but for longer stays you may want to go elsewhere.,"Oshkosh, Wisconsin","smh102</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oshkosh, Wisconsin</strong>",24,3.0

Spectacular view of Diamond Head, Waikiki, Ala Wai Canal and the Pacific Ocean. It was a functional room with two double beds, full sized refrigerator, stove and kitchen sink. The bathroom was so tiny the door couldn't be completely opened. Not good. We booked a room the last two nights our family was there and were put on the 15th floor in a renovated room facing Diamond Head. Nice view also but lots wrong. First we found a pair of shorts hanging on the shower rod, the shower head was very fancy but so low we had to duck under it to get wet, the vent was falling out of the ceiling and had to be pushed back in, the sink was a small kitchen sink, very deep and the stopper was like a kitchen sink. At least we could open the door all the way. The beds were queen sized and the mattress sat on a wooden frame which was too big and we often ran into the corners. Moving the mattress didn't help because if anyone sat or laid on the bed it moved and the corner was exposed again. The toilet seat was so cheap it bent when sat on it and had a sharp point on it and the air conditioner was so loud, even with just the fan, you couldn't hear the t.v. if it was running plus our room was next to the trash shute and when we opened the door the smell would permeate the room. Yuck. The front desk folks were actually very nice especially PT and Marynoll. The pool area is on the sixth floor and it is extremely nice. It is also keyed, in and out. They have a hot tub, showers, bathrooms, sauna, washers and driers and several gas barbeque units that are available for use. There is no WiFI except in the lobby and it costs. Also local phone calls are $1. The hotel is convenient to restaurants and only three blocks from the beach. It is the tallest hotel in Waikiki, however, the elevators don't always work and the convenience store on the 6th is very expensive. Pool towels are available on the 5th floor parking area and a separate elevator goes there, then back to the lobby and on another elevator to the pool. All in all, for the money we paid, it was average in some ways and very disappointing in others plus the price is going up for the renovated rooms. By the way, the room keys are terrible and we had to have them rekeyed three times, a pain.","Honolulu, Hawaii","weggerzz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",38,3.0

We had booked for a pamoramic ocean view room, but instead, were given a city view room. At check-out, I was charged for the OV room and when I asked the front desk about it, they gave me the credit. So, recommend that you always check your bill.Recently remodeled, clean place. Feels like a apt/condo bldg, not a hotel. They have a pool, mini-mart, and bbq area on the 6th floor. About 3-4 blocks from the beach, but really a short walk.Not bad for Plan B since the Sheraton Waikiki wasn't available.","San Francisco, California","maverickgirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",17,4.0

We opted to stay at the Aqua Skytower as its location on the Ala Wai provides convenient routes to out-of-area restaurants without being stuck in traffic. Brian Kovaloff handled our reservation requests professionally and promptly. We were greeted cordially and warmly by Leilani, who despite being the only person at the front desk, managed to juggle phone calls, check-ins and guest requests with an unflappable and calm friendliness. Our door keys failed to work after three attempts and on the last, Leilani accompanied us upstairs to help. My husband dislikes the Waikiki area to the point of winding himself into an angry frenzy anytime he he is in the area, so we drove out of Waikiki to have dinner. When we returned, Leilani informed us that the lock, rather than the keys, was broken and that we would be moved to another room. The first room was very comfortable, but the second room was a better upgrade. My husband, a geographer, even relaxed and was able to observe and point out the Kaimuki Dome and its place in the volcanic rift zone from Leahi to the Kaneohe Marine Corps area from the lanai of our new room. He thus lightened up a bit and was able to gain something from our stay. The only drawback for me was the lack of central air-conditioning in the second (one bedroom) room, which kept the bedroom cool, but left the living and dining area warm. Both Brain and Leilani were super! Accommodations in the hospitality industry have everything to do with how one is treated and I loved the cheery and efficient customer service provided us by these two outstanding professionals.",Honolulu,"Claire S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu</strong>",1,5.0
