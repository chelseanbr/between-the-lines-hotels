We were at Haneda Airport- Tokyo International Airport - for a 12 hours 25 minute layover before our 5 hour flight to Manila. After the flight we decided to stay at this property to freshen up and catch some sleeps before the upcoming flight. This property was what the doctor ordered. Yes the rooms are on the tighter side but, when your objective is resting and freshening up for your connecting flight, the size of the room is not an issue. They had all the bath amenities that was needed with a bath tub a complementary water in the fridge and they even had a lounge with drinks (orange juice, water and coffee) and, to my surprise, cup noodle for a little snack. All these and efficient service from the Night manager(?) for $141 was definitely worth it. We’re adding this property for a long layover pit-stop at Haneda Airport. Also, if your layover is not as long, we’re talking about few hours, they also have a refresh room starting at 3,000 yen (roughly $30) for an hour.","New York City, New York","Japandroid89</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",9,5.0

Recommend booking ahead, it's not a large hotel and sold out quickly when we got to the airport. We opted for six and was great to just get a quiet place for a solid nap in a real bed and a shower before taking off next day. (I spent 9 hours on the floor in Singapore and was NOT doing that again!) Rooms clean, staff friendly, also they give you a sleeping gown so you don't have to sleep in travel clothing. Nice touches like extra toothbrush, hair dryer, clothing refresher, in the room.

However, they do have a small freshen up room with a shower, tv, internet (no bed, no toilet) for ¥2,000, that turned out to be just what I needed and worth it.

I arrived at almost 11pm at night and passing through customs and immigration was pretty quick. After doing a little research on this hotel online I was able to find the hotel easily at the far end of the check in lobby of the international terminal. Look for a travelers review with good photos on how to get here if you find it difficult. There are also signs directing you to the airport hotel. The hotel is outside of the security check point so you do not have to worry about that step in trying to access this hotel. Just go through all the check points, pickup your luggage and after you get to the arrivals lobby, go upstairs one level and walk to the end of the check in lobby on the left side (by the ""L"" counters) and follow the signs.I had booked a standard single room for a pretty good price considering I was staying here the night prior to Christmas Eve. I booked the room in October and was able to get the early bird rate. Check in was easy and quick despite a slight language barrier and the nice woman at the front desk gave me a room on the premium (8th) floor at no extra charge. She did this on her own accord, I did not ask her for an upgrade. I am not sure of the difference in a standard or premium room, but for this type of ""single"" room it was pretty nice and roomy in comparison to other single rooms I have stayed in during past visits to Japan.The room was neat and clean. There were a set of pajamas and house slippers for my use. All the needed amenities in the bathroom. The bathroom has the usual Japanese bidet type toilet, sink and bathtub/shower. The wall separating the bedroom and bathroom is all glass so if you have a room with more than one person, there is absolutely no privacy if you are on the toilet or in the shower. Not that I looked for one, but I did not notice even a curtain to pull shut. I was there alone so no problem for me there. The bed and pillow was comfortable enough for me, and I slept good. The door doesn't do a good job of blocking noise coming from the hallway outside the room as I could hear some children and their parents talking as they walked by. There is construction going on outside at this part of the airport, but I believe since it was the day before Christmas that morning, they had the day off so no noise problem.I checked out at the designated time of 11:00 am that morning and since I paid for the room when I checked in the nice lady at the front desk said I was good after I turned in my key. My flight was not until 9:00 pm that evening so they let me keep my luggage stored there. I took the monorail into Tokyo city and went exploring and shopping for souvenirs before coming back at about 6:00 pm picked up my luggage and checked in for my flight.I would definitely stay at this hotel again in the same scenario. I guess it would be good for a longer stay if you like staying in the airport environment for an extended period.

The price is almost 10,000 yen above other Japanese business-type hotels with similar room sizes and amenities. We chose a double-room on the 7th floor with a view to the west. Be forewarned - on a western scale this is more like a 3-star hotel, only the premium rooms on the 8th floor could be described as 4-star. They include breakfast in only some, not all of the rates, and there are no complimentary English-language newspapers and such (and BBC is the only English TV channel despite being located at a MAJOR INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - a proper airport hotel should have CNN, Al Jazeera, ITV - there are SO MANY CHINESE GUESTS at this hotel and they don't even have CCTV etc)The rooms are decently appointed but storage space and the desk provided are small. My wife had to bring the mirror over to the windowsill and sit on the bed because the desk was too small and poorly-lit for doing makeup at. They do provide a small table and sofa in the corner near the bed, and this was nice to have meals at. The carpeting is soft and nice to walk on.The bathroom is good-sized, with a decent bathtub and German fixtures in the sink fittings. One major disappointment was at all times of day the water temperature fluctuates WILDLY in the shower, which makes no sense considering the fixings and construction are new within the last 5 years! The best feature of the rooms overall is the soundproofing - very difficult to hear outside traffic, airplanes, etc (only high-pitched childrens' voices from the hall can be heard - but that's true in any hotel). Housekeeping did quite a good job seeing as they are cleaning up after travelers, but the towels are the same miniature size found in other Japanese hotels and are a little rough to the skin. Larger and softer towels are a must if this hotel wishes to satisfy customers from overseas. Check-in didn't take as long as at other Japanese hotels, but the hotel does not seem very flexible about checking in before 3 pm, and this doesn't make sense at a major airport. We did not try the restaurant as there are more inexpensive (and likely far better) options a short walk away in the terminal (and highly recommend the Turkish kebab place on the 4th floor of the terminal).Overall, because of the location and good soundproofing, I would stay here again, but probably only at a discounted price.",,Harold L,3,3.0

We arrived, bedraggled, at 11.45am and were told that we could not be checked in until Noon and were asked to take a seat in the lobby. Having been traveling in Japan for the last two weeks, we had realized that their nation is very efficient and rule driven in every aspect so we understood the request. However we felt a little more leniency with 15minutes and travelers that were so obviously worn out would have been welcomed. A little 15 minute breaking of a rule would have given this hotel a better star rating. Their inability to be flexible and make an independent decision based on what they saw was not good and my husband retaliated by setting his phone alarm to ring loudly on the strike of Noon. At which point, a staff member told us that we could now check in. As with most Japanese hotels and staff, the rooms cater for every need and we could not complain. The choice of food in the restaurants in the airport is very, very limited. However, a great spot if you will be in our position of having to travel early the next morning or connecting.

Just enough room to walk around the bed and pretty much nothing else. But the room has TV, kettle, robes, all bathroom amenities you could want (including flannel, hairbrush as well as the more normal toothbrush, soap, shampoo etc). Bed is very comfortable (on the hard side, but this is Asia). The pillows are quite interesting - one half is hard (buckwheat I think) the other half is feather. So you just use the side you like best which is pretty cool. Plenty of plug sockets (two flat prongs). Overall very convenient hotel for airport stopovers, late arrivals or early departures.

The furnishings and amenities seemed new and well-maintained and the bathroom included the standard high-tech Japanese toilet that are common in Japan. The shower also gave off great water pressure. But even so, I found the room not particularly well-designed for international travelers. There were no USB charging points, for instance, and the lack of space made it difficult for two adults to move around easily.

The funny part about our room is that the bathroom had the only window, in this case a picture window onto the runway, but it was bright and well organized. Excellent wifi and water pressure. A steamer trunk bench and globe table set the travel theme. Considering what is on offer airside Sound was the only issue. There is no sound communication between rooms, but the door onto the hallway captures all the conversations of people coming and going. Most guests probably don’t stay long enough at the hotel to realize how much the sound affects everyone in the rooms until they themselves are in bed at night.There are a ton of offerings for food adjacent to the hotel, on levels 4F and 5F above the departures level of the terminal.

Beautifully presented and just steps away from the arrivals hall. On booking in it became apparent that my request from 3 weeks prior had not been read, as my friend and I had booked a night each and I wanted to ensure we could stay in the same room.What we had not realised is, I had booked a superior twin and she had booked a Hollywood twin which was half the size and not on the premium floor. We were told because of this we would have to move. I wasn't happy with this because although the mistake was ours, had they of read the email, they could have told us this and we could of made arrangements or changed the booking.However I didn't need to worry as the hotel, through good will, waivered any additional charges and allowed us to stay in the superior room.The room itself - 100% worth the extra money. It was spacious and beautifully decorated. Extras that were missing in the 4 Star Grand Prince were all here including large and small bottles of water, coffee machine (lovely coffee btw) and even a facial skin care pack including cleansers etc.Bedding was perfect, as was the mattress and as a lovely surprise along with our breakfast voucher (which you can use for lunch or dinner too instead, of which I would recommend using for dinner unless you enjoy a Japanese breakfast) we also got a drinks voucher for the bar! That was a super lovely treat and we both enjoyed a 700yen sparkling wine.Highly recommend the Royal Park as first/last night of trips and you can use the monorail in your JR Pass Thank you for a lovely few nights Royal Park.","London, United Kingdom","TheBudgetTravellers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",8,5.0

Our rationale was since we were scheduled for an early morning flight we would not have to travel to Haneda during rush hour with all of our bags. We took the train to the monorail and the monorail stops right at the terminals, domestic or international, with extra sections set aside for your extra luggage. We arrived too early to check in but like many Tokyo hotels we were allowed to store our bags, since we had reservations, until it was check in time. A big plus since arriving early might work best with ones schedule.The hotel is at the south side of the International terminal with plenty of signage showing the way. You will walk along the side of a restaurant on the way there, just so you don't feel as if you are going the wrong way. The staff at the front desk were the usual Japanese perfect example of greetings and assisting. Always gracious hosts and very efficient while doing it. The hotel is immaculately clean in the public areas and the private rooms. It is well maintained and everything worked.If you are staying here on your journey home then you should already be familiar with the Japanese heated toilet seats, if just arriving it will be easy as the instructions are also in English. The television had three channels that were either broadcast or closed captioned in English, which was a change for us as it was the first TV we had watched in the nearly five weeks we had been in Japan.The beds were very comfortable and the room nicely laid out.There is the fore mentioned restaurant just outside the hotel doors and near the center of the terminal there are a multitude of various restaurants available on the second or third floor.There is also an English speaking medical clinic in the terminal just in case.There is a walk out area on the back side, behind the restaurants that you can go outside and watch the planes arrive/depart. There are picnic tables and the usual vending machines.The only problem we encountered was the location of our rooms, the floor below the lobby. Since the lobby has hard tile floors each and every time a guest rolled their suitcases across the floor it transmitted that noise along our ceiling waking us a couple of times during the night. If not for this I would have rated the hotel a five star.So beware if you are on the fourth floor back towards the terminal.","Venice, Florida","RickHLihue</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Venice, Florida</strong>",75,4.0

It's right past the last row of check-in counter (Row L).Checking in was very easy; I'd booked and prepaid so it was very easy. I thought it was interesting that they did not ask for a credit card for incidentals.When I got to the room, I realized why: there is no room service nor mini bar(PICK UP SOME WATER AND/OR SNACKS AT THE TERMINAL BEFORE YOU HEAD UP YOUR ROOM--otherwise it's a long walk back).The elevators are at one end of the hotel. The higher your room number, the longer your walk will be. The room was fine; comfortable bed, but pillows were odd. Pajamas and slippers provided.

Modern clean bathroom with good amenities (shaving and dental kits, too).Check out time is strictly 11:00.From Haneda, it's very easy to get to Tokyo for the day. It's much closer than Narita.

I highly recommend a stroll across old Nihonbashi Bridge which takes you back to old Edo! Beds were comfortable and the included buffet breakfast was excellent in selection (not huge but tasty) and quality. Great for a overnight stay after landing, a layover, or a night prior to leaving.

I booked a Double which, by Western standards, was still quite small (18m on up) but was very well-appointed and comfortable, with basic toiletries provided and those terrific Toto toilets. The hotel also laid out complimentary cotton pajamas (cut for a more traditional Japanese frame, though, so a bit short on me). My rate included breakfast, which was a nice buffet with a mix of Japanese and Western items, hot and cold.

Unlike many airport hotels, the Royal Park is only steps away from the departures hall. The monorail (you can use your JR Railways pass) stops at the International Terminal and is also just a short walk away.Apparently there is another entrance to the hotel airside – so connecting passengers don’t even need to clear customs and immigration. Both sides are obviously kept separate.We stayed one night in the landside half of the hotel as we were flying out of Haneda the next morning.To be honest I wasn’t expecting much, perhaps a small basic room with a small bed. And that was fine for the price – just somewhere to sleep before our flight. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the hotel was actually pretty good.Check in was smooth and the man on the desk said he’d given us a larger room. We took the elevator to our floor and realised that our room was at the end of a long corridor.When we arrived the room had a large bed and a small separate lounge area.Pyjamas were laid out nicely on the bed.The bathroom had a typical electronic toilet, shower and washbasin with multiple amenities, including toothbrushes, razors etc.We went for a walk around the terminal as I’d heard there were some good restaurants there – in fact there was an entire Japanese-themed walk, with plenty of great restaurants.We ate in Yaki Niku Champion 焼肉チャンピオン 羽田店 which was excellent.Back in our room, the pillows were a little strange – they felt like they’d been stuffed with small rocks. The bed was maybe too hard for some. But we had a good night’s sleep and were ready for our flight the next morning.We didn’t have breakfast in the hotel as we were expecting to eat this in the ANA Lounge – sadly that was a mistake and the ANA lounge had the same food as in the evening.I’d definitely recommend booking a night at the Royal Park if you are flying out of Haneda early – or even arriving late and want to rest before starting your Japanese journey.","Prague, Czech Republic","Feagz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Prague, Czech Republic</strong>",192,5.0

This is by far the most convenient hotel. It's located on the 3rd floor (departure floor/ check in) all the way at one end. FYI arrivals are on the second floor, so just take escalator up one floor. I booked hotel thru hotels.com. There was an additional ""tax"" of 100yen that I had to pay. Otherwise check in was quick, and receptionist spoke friendly English. The hotel has its own dining area and bar, but you can easily access the great selection in the airport area. The room was good size by Japanese standards. Bathroom had everything you would need and great quality and smelling shampoo/ body wash/ conditioner/ face wash. The bed was comfortable and the pillow was ingenious. Pillow could be soft or firm, higher or lower. There's a small card that explains its features. The wifi is fast. I rested so well and was appreciative that it was so conveniently located because after those long flights, I just want to lay down as soon as possible. A little information about transferring to Narita. You can buy a ticket on the limousine bus on the second floor (I prefer this to taking the train because worried I'll get lost and this is the most direct). Cost for me was 3100 yen one way, or you can ask for a round trip about 4500 yen. Ticket place opens at 5am. Line looks long but moves quickly. After purchasing ticket, ask for a small map that will explain how to get to bus stop (essentially it's on the first floor). I have nothing but good things to say. I will definitely use this hotel again. ",,airamyh,60,5.0

The hotel is located in the departures lobby, so if you're coming in off an international flight you'll need to go up to the third floor. The hotel gets a huge amount of use from travelers and airline crews, so the rooms definitely feel a bit dated and used. They are clean, and appointed with basic amenities you'll want during a layover. Wifi is fast. Check in was extremely quick every time I've been there, despite a large number of people coming and going. The rooms are not totally soundproof, so you can hear things in the hallway if people are being very noisy, but the rooms are quiet enough for me. Ther was a bit of a smell in one of my rooms, probably someone had smoked there (which is against the rule). Ultimately a fine hotel if you need a place to lay your head during a 10+ hour layover in HND and aren't interested in going into the city. Prices are good for what you get. Rooms are small, but I only come here to sleep. Breakfast isn't included, never ate there. Room service stops at 22:30, which isn't good. Ideally it would be overnight for people coming in late.","Hanoi, Vietnam","BanhRan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hanoi, Vietnam</strong>",109,3.0

Sometimes they sleep with all of their travel belongings next to them in some corner thinking it's safe? I discovered that Haneda Airport has a Transit hotel for times like this. This particular hotel especially needs this type of hotel because many of the flights to the US leave after 11 PM (some as late as 2 AM). I was prepared to be unimpressed and to pay too much, but I really needed to get some sleep prior to my flight to the US and wasn't up to dragging my luggage around tokyo trying to see some things at the last minute. My flight departed at 12:30 AM and I arrived at the airport at 4 PM.To my delight I found the room to be very clean, efficient, and equipped with everything I needed for a good rest plus free high speed Wi-Fi. The room itself was quite small, just big enough for the bed and walking room a dresser and small closet and luggage storage area. It also included a TV, AC, small fridge with complimentary water, clean PJs, and a fully functioning bathroom and shower. I got comfy, cleaned up, turned out the lights and was surprised how dark the room was. Because of this, a very comfortable bed, extreme quite (great soundproofing), I fell asleep quickly, and woke up to the requested wake up call from the desk. They also have a lounge with bottled water, snacks and decent coffee all included in the price. The only thing disappointing was the price. There's one price for 1 to 12 hours, but it would be nice to have this in 4 hour increments. The price was $100 USD approx. For me it was well worth the price for this very restful sleep considering my circumstances and that I find sleeping on airplanes very difficult. Something else very important is that the hotel is through security, so when you depart the hotel you are close to your gate with zero delay. I even had time for the many excellent duty free shopping stores at the airport! I was refreshed for my flight and was able to get some good solid work time and movie time in the flight instead of being a zombie. Solid 9 out of ten star for this place. Marked down one star because of inflexible pricing.","San Diego, California","Michael M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",41,5.0

Great location, great service, great room, great bed, overall is an excellent experience. The only down side about the place is probably the price, it is kindly expensive. This property is by no mean designed for any stay longer than 1 night, if you're here other than transit, look for another place.Location:This is an AIRPORT HOTEL, not an airport near the hotel, but a hotel that is actually part of the airport. So you can walk directly from baggage claim to the hotel without the need of ever needed to exit the building. Pretty important time saving if you only really have 6 hrs of sleep until your next flight.**NOTE**The hotel is located inside the International Terminal, hence if your connecting flight is a domestic operation, you'll need to exit the terminal and catch a free shuttle bus to get to the Domestic Terminal. The bus operates every 5-10 minutes, and the trip is about 5-10 minutes. You'll need to allow yourself about 5-10 minutes to walk from the hotel to the bus stop. Overall, please allow yourself about 30 minutes to get from the hotel to the Domestic Terminals.Japan doesn't require a 2hrs advance check-in for domestic flights (except for LCC), you can literally walk up to the counter for check-in 30 mins prior to departure (not recommended), I'd suggest to be there 45 mins prior to your flight, doesn't have to be 2 hrs, it will get you 90mins more sleep.Room:Typical tiny Japanese room with a queen bed. The room barely have enough space to open 1 full size suitcase, let alone two. But it serves its function, the bed was comfy and large (in Japanese Standard), room was spotlessly clean, all round excellent. The window inside the room is sound proof, so you won't hear a thing from outside.Dinning:Your rate might include free breakfast, mine did, but I didn't have the chance to try it as my flight leaves at 6:30am. If you're arriving into HND late, you may buy some food at the fast food restaurant located on the same floor as the hotel, actually buy whatever food you need while you're walking towards the hotel, as it is along the way, that'll save you time from walking back and forth twice.Service:As always in Japan, excellent. Is a transit hotel, all you need is a speedy check-in and a good night sleep.Tips:- WiFi is Free.","Hong Kong / Kelowna, BC, Canada","Crossingtheglobe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong / Kelowna, BC, Canada</strong>",244,4.0

Arriving late on Saturday and the flight to Ube being at noon on Sunday, the idea of waiting almost twelve hours in a business clasas lounge was not appealing. So we decided to check-in to this airport hotel.The front desk staff looked fresh (it was almost midnight) and attentive. Their English language skill were sufficient and our check-in process was completed within ten minutes. We were given verbal directions to our rooms but there was no bellhop service. We were also allowed to wheel our airport luggage trolleys to our room but the elevators were large enough to fit only one trolley.The rooms were tiny by my experience. Too small for my liking There was no way to squeeze in the luggage trolley. Suitcases need to be unloaded into the room and the trolley wheeled back to the elevator lobby on the same floor.Even though the rooms were tiny, they were clean and modern, well-equipped, with LAN, Wi-fi, and typically Japanese toilet automation. There were two electrical wall sockets (100V US-style twin slots), which was sufficient for my use at that time. I had to also use the air-conditioning wall control pad by trial-and-error was the language of the LCD was in Japanese.Each floor had a small room for an ice dispenser and drinks vending machines and I found this an added convenience. The team were hungry and we went out of the hotel to explore, where we found two cafes just fifty metres on the same floor that served hot soup, noodles and sandwiches, both meat and vegetarian. Having Google Translate on our mobile phones came in handy,The single bed was comfortable and I had an uninterrupted six-hour sleep.In the morning, we went out again looking for breakfast and found the hotel's coffee house called Tailwind and it looked nice. But instead of going there, we went exploring into the airport's shopping arcade (that was designed to look like the streets of a town) and found several other outlets. We settled for a short-order place called Expasa Cafe that faced the exterior and had outdoor tables.The check-out process was quick too. For smokers, there was a small smoking room next Tailwind. We used the same luggage trolleys that we found at the elevator lobby on our room floor. There were LED screens showing flight schedules in the lobby.Even though the rooms were tiny, Royal Park Hotel The Haneda was clean, modern and convenient, for the price of about USD150 per night (which may be regarded a bit high for some travellers).

The bathroom has one of those glass panels that divides the room from it. So if you are planning on sharing the room with some one you dont regularly share the shower with,my advice is mail them in advance so they can give u a more private ""salle de bains"" if u may. As far as the hotel was concerned the noise level was the only issue I encountered. Since the walls are pretty thin and the rooms are quite small, the noise from the corridor might keep u up . I am NOT a light sleeper, I am proud of my ability of been able to sleep through basically any noise. But boy! did this hotel prove me wrong. But all in all.. Meh.The toilet has one of those perpetually warm seats, which, oh my god feels so good during winter.The operating instructions are in english and in Japanese so if you mix up the bidet with the intensity of the spray u my friend, need some help.ehem.

But you can turn left just outside the lobby and find a designated smoking area for the hotel guests.There is a train station on the second floor of the airport so u can get to anywhere during your stay here.

I originally rated this hotel a five and actually had to officially withdraw that review because I submitted it just before check out and the experience during check out was what made me change my rating. Overall, I still think it's a great hotel but unfortunately ruined by one person, sadly it was the manager on duty last Tuesday, Feb 23 at around 12nnGreat things about this hotel1. Convenient location for transit and short stop overs. It is accessible through airport and connected through train lines. If the intent is to stay connected to airport and transport this hotel is a good choice. If Tokyo is just a day tour, this hotel is perfect 2. The room is small compared to standard but well kept, modern and elegant3. Staff was polite,helpful during check in. Check in was a breeze4. Breakfast buffet included and has a wide range of options even for vegetarians 5. Wifi was fast enough to watch Netflix without interruption 6. I would stay here again if the intent is to connect through different parts of Japan. If Tokyo is the main location I recommend to stay right in the heart of Tokyo 7. A bit pricey but I was willing to pay for the convenience and the efficiency of transit -- that made it well worth it****** my original review ended there ...but please read on Check out became a horrible experience because1. We asked if we could leave a set of clothes (a pair of pants, dress shirt and a coat) because we were trying to travel light for our onward journey in Nagano but was told their policy won't allow that. We were coming back on the 29th but we won't be checked in so that -- to me was understandable. I wasn't going to mark them down for that. I understood concerns of logistics, storage etc. it's just that most hotels would allow for it. We travel a lot and that was a first decline to such request. But like I said, that's understandable 2. The real unpleasant experience was when we were looking for our local driver and asked the staff politely if he could be kind enough to ring a local number .. The answer was a flat NO. A blank expression, no apology NO. When we asked to speak to the manager, he said, ""I am the manager"" and so we thought to avoid the drama, we'll use Skype and move on. Just like that, the hotel left a bad taste in customer service for us.","Manila, Philippines","PinayExplorer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",64,2.0

After having visited the airport clinic (at which time I was running a 40 deg C fever) I thought it would be best to check in at Royal Park since I could barely walk and carry my luggage.The helpful airline ground staff told me that there are room availabilities at Royal Park Hotel Haneda, so when I arrived there and explained my condition I was told that they had no free rooms I was surprised and worried. After resting in the lobby for a little while, I decided to check online and saw that indeed there was an availability, to which the Royal Park Hotel front desk said yes there is but it has to be booked online, which is fine with me. After I've made my online booking (10:30am) I was told that check-in is at 3pm. Instead, running a fever and visibly ill, I had to sleep in the lobby for about 2 hours until the airline ground staff came around to check on me. It was only at this point that reception approached me and informed me that I can check in early.I think they should have explained in the first place:(1) That there may be availabilities online that I could book since there are no free rooms on their system; (2) that I can check in early and just pay an extra fee.Apart from that, the hotel room was beautiful, quiet, and the amenities are well though out. Most of the older staff rostered in the evening during my stay are very nice and hospitable. I'm unsure if it was because I turned up without a booking but surely those are not grounds for receiving the cold treatment?","Sydney, Australia","M C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",0,3.0

Though you slept a bit on the plane, you are really tired. You walk a few hundred yards to the Royal Park Haneda Hotel, IN the international Haneda terminal! Check in is easy. There are always THREE people manning the front desk.The rooms are expensive, though the fees change almost daily, depending upon a specific date. I found using the internet to rent the room a few months in advance got me a significant discount. There are many varieties of rooms. My wife and I don't travel light...we went for the premium superior twin. The room is narrower than we find in the US, but we could find room to place 4 suitcases either on the furniture, a case holder, or in a corner of the room on the floor.  The beds are super comfortable. The bathroom is quite large...there is a walk in shower. Toilet seat is heated. The toilet fills up when one is sitting on the john, and flushes when you stand up. Of course there is a bidet function, with a variety of spritz types!! The wifi in the room worked better than the wifi in the terminal. The place is well insulated. We are IN the airport, and never heard a plane! Nice view from the large window. There is a restaurant right next to the lobby. Our room came with breakfast....which was absolutely fantastic. A myriad of choices, buffet style, both Japanese and American foods. Omelets cooked on demand...were great! Much fun experimenting with the Japanese offerings! There are trains and busses right outside the airport. Train into central Tokyo takes about 45min to an hour. Bus up to Narita airport also leaves right outside the terminal.

My family of four and I decided to stay here for one night because we were arriving into Haneda late at night from the US. Because we were traveling with two young children, we did not want to spend too much effort going to an off-airport hotel, or even worse, trying to get into Tokyo proper and potentially missing the last trains if our flight was delayed. The Haneda met my needs completely, and enabled us to get a good night sleep on our first night and potentially minimized jet-lag for the family. It was a good start to our holidays.The hotel lobby is literally located next to the check-in counters at the airport – super convenient even with luggage. We had booked a Deluxe Twin for four people. As other reviewers mentioned, the room is not spacious, but they did manage to put in four beds into the room, which was great. It was wall-to-wall beds, but if the goal is to get a good night sleep, it was perfectly fine. The room was very modern and clean, with a Japanese style bath, and a separate toilet / water closet room.The one surprise was that I did find a harder time than expected finding takeout dinner late at night. There is a restaurant at the hotel, but I just wanted something quick to bring back to the room. Although there are a lot of restaurants listed to be open 24 hours inside the airport, it turned out that most of them are “airside” after security, and only a few outside security.Other tips:- There’s a JR Rail office right at the airport to exchange your JR Rail Pass. I found it to be super crowded first thing in the morning, but not so bad if you come back an hour after the office opens.- Take advantage of the many luggage delivery services at the airport to send your bags ahead to your destination. Save the effort to carry your bags on and off trains .. it’ll be there waiting for you in a day or two, and it’s a relatively economical service.","San Francisco, California","PoodleRank</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",107,4.0

My room was tiny but very efficiently laid out, clean, quiet and comfortable. The glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom can be a little disconcerting, but as I was alone, it didn't bother me and it did allow some light into the room from the bathroom window (there is a blind to pull down to block the light and the non-existent view). Bed was comfortable with the conveniently placed light switches that one finds in Asian hotels. The low credenza that holds a flat screen TV also contains a safe and a small refrigerator. My favorite (though minor) amenity--TWO boxes of tissues--one in the bedroom and one in the bathroom. Shower/bath easier to use than some and the toilet options are in both Japanese and English (and on a wall panel so easy to read/use). I would stay here again any time.

I had a 850am international departure flight the next day2. I had children and elderly passengers with me 3. I could do a last minute shopping at the airport for souvenirs4. I could pack my bulky winter clothing into my luggage and checked it in with the airline. The hotel was at the side of the international terminal. It was on the departure floor, hence I could wheel all my luggage on the airport trolley into the hotel, their lift, right into my room. Very handy when you have quite a bit to carry and tired. And when I checked out, right to my airline counter!Check in was strictly 3pm onwards. I arrived at 2pm. They gave me an option to check in 1hour earlier at a fee of Y1,000 per room (I have 3 rooms). I would expect it to be free if rooms were available. But it was a reasonable amount. Rather than to wait or leave your luggage with the bell boy I supposed?Front desk staff could speak English.Room was big, modern, functional but not as luxurious as the one in Shiodome,Tokyo. I had a family room that could fit 4 beds, a sofa and still space for us to move around freely. My room faced the main road leading to the departure terminal, so it wasn't much of a view. The other side of the hotel faced the runway. Better view I supposed? But you do have an open/enclosed viewing gallery at the departure hall on level 5, hence the runway view might not be necessary.Sleep quality was good. In fact the pillow had two sides, one which is hard and the other soft. The pillow can be extended too. Yes, extended. At a loss on how to describe. See it yourself.Stable wifi in the room.There was a dressing room with a separate shower and bathtub. WC was in a separate room near the main door, so someone could be having a shower and another in the WC at the same time with no privacy issue. The hotel's water tank was made from wood, supposed to be anti-bacterial, eco-friendly and would last longer than 30 years. It gave the water a slight sweet taste and a nice wooden smell. Look out for that. There were ample restaurants, Mos Burger, Yoshinoya and a convenience store in the airport. The shopping at the airport -- before clearing immigration...it was adequate for last minute gifts like snacks and souvenirs. But just barely. It was no where near HK, Spore or South Korea's standards. Strange. After passing immigration, there were the usual plus some luxury brands offerings - but not much, Hence you might want to buy your gifts in Tokyo if you came across any.

There's more space outside Tokyo and it shows with the room size. The hotel provided a cot at no extra charge, which was wonderful. The only oddity was that they could only provide a twin room, i.e. two separate single beds, if we wanted the cot. If it was a king bed, the room would be much smaller and not able to fit a cot.There was a separate bath and shower area as is the norm in Japan. They also had a separate cubicle for the WC, which makes complete sense. One downside was that we had to our toddler even though they obviously would have known, given that they set up the cot.The location was great, just off the check in area at the airport, and it was possible to push the luggage cart into the hotel lift and directly to the room. The corridors were dark and depressing, just like what airport hotels are expected to be.My main beef about this place was that reception staff were not well trained. One in particular didn't have good English and was not trained to hand us over to someone else who could. He came across as rude and standoffish, basically saying no to everything (when all we were asking about was details about how early we should checkout considering our flight departure times, and the details involved). We had to be firm about asking for another staff member to take over before we got someone with better English to take over. This would be fine in any other hotel in Japan except an airport hotel. Staff should at least be trained to hand over any language issues to someone who could understand and answer appropriately.

FacilitiesThe hotels offers free fast WIFI that is secure and can be used for multiple devices. There is a restaurant near lobby plus a smoking room and art gallery. There is also a massage service as mentioned in guide. Staff Staff are pleasant polite but regimented with struct guidelines that check-in is only allowed at 3pm with check out at 11am. I left at midnight so was allowed to check-in 30 minutes early, but with persuasion- she initially tried to charge me for 230pm check-in which seemed a bit over the top. They also charge a 100 yen tax despite a pre-pay booking as some form of city tax. Overall a perfect location for between flights as no need to leave airport, HND has lots of nice facilities and shops, restaurants etc on 4th floor (one level above) so a nice spot without having to wait for a shuttle service meaning can maximise sleep as check-in area is on same level as lobby. However slightly over priced for what you get, when say compared to Hotel mystays or Excel- which both offered a working desk at around the same rate or less. However it was 3 days prior to christmas so perhaps prices were unusually high. However as mentioned very convenient for international departures in between flights and comfortable room.

I've used this hotel as my ""pied-a-terre"" for short stays - usually at an Expedia rate of about $150 USD. At that price, it is very good value. Once you clear customs, you walk through the terminal (which has not been very crowded when I've been there) to the opposite end and check-in to the hotel. Getting to sleep in a nice clean room right away, instead of having to take the train into the city allows you to start the next day raring to go. It is a straight shot into Yokohama or Tokyo (about 35 min to the latter). I like being able to recover away from the city crowds at night, back at the quiet airport. There aren't a lot of options for eating in the airport (or anything much to do - although there is a cool flight simulator that you can pay to play on, on the top floor), so you'll eat before returning to your room at night. I love the view of Mt Fuji from the terminal and the fact that I can walk leisurely in the terminal to the train station without having to navigate crowds. I notice that the price per room has crept up well over $200. Probably won't stay here more than one night at that price point. But, if you see a good rate, it's great value.

First day from airports often takes extra hours to get settled in, with a train or cab ride, or a wait for the shuttle for pick-up, while tugging multiple suitcases. After a long flight it was a delight to have a shower and a comfortable bed to stretch right away with minimal walking with suitcases and duffles. Considering the time we needed for settling in a hotel and ways to get there, this hotel was well worth the cost because it is just the left of the departure area. Because Haneda Airport is inside the city of Tokyo, I think the next morning one can get to any part of Tokyo with a short commute. It is also close to Odaiba for family travelers and shoppers - from Haneda Airport a bus ride is about 18 min, for 500 yen.Despite the proximity to the check-in area of the airport, the noise was surprisingly low and thoughts that went into to ensure security without intimidating guests were impressive. There was also a nice mall at the airport on the same floor too, which was worth spending a few hours itself (things were a bit pricey there but the mall was modeled after an old Edo-city, which was neat). When we asked for our suitcases to be stored for a couple of hours as we checked out to go to those shops, we were also nicely surprised. When we came back for our luggages, they were ready to roll out on a single airport cart (with no tip necessary, of course). The staff were truly professional; they knew how to keep appropriate distance from guests but ensure their stay would be comfortable.

Needless to say, I was tired and cranky and my husband was equally as tired (but much less cranky). We disembarked from our ANA flight into a long hallway of gates (and nothing else - literally, this hallway was just exit gates to planes). Very little english. And NO direction on how to get to the Transit Hotel.I had done my research and I knew the transit hotel was within the secure area and I would not have to go thru customs and immigration to get to the OTHER Royal Park hotel at this airport. But we still wandered around this long hallway with dozens of passengers for about 15 mins. The ""helpers"" and security in this area speak very very little english and none either knew or understood what I was talking about when I asked where the transit hotel was. A fell passenger from our flight mistakenly directed us down to the end of the hallway. In order to find the transit hotel, you must go through the transit area to the international departure terminal. Since we arrived on an international flight, I figured that was where we were, but the departure and arrival areas are completely separate. You must go through security again in order to go UP to the international departure area. Once you figure this out, the transit hotel is easy to find on the departure level. The room was small, but we knew this going in. Its perhaps the cleanest hotel I've ever stayed in. They provide literally everything you will need for a layover. Pj's, toothbrushes, toothpaste - you name it. The beds are hard and the pillows have instructions (read the instructions), but the room was worth its weight in gold for the fact that we could sleep before our 9am flight out to Hanoi. Having done the relatively same route-ish before (Vancouver - Seoul - Bali) all in one shot, I found the ability to be horizontal for 6 or so hours to be wonderful.There is no restaurant in this hotel, but the departures terminal was open when we made our way down for food around 8pm. the food selections are - odd, to say the least, but its nutrition that didn't come from the back of a plane, so its fine.Its pricey and if this hotel was in the middle of a city, I would have been outraged at what we got for the price, but the fact that you don't need to exit the secure area and hell, its a bed and washroom, makes it worth it on a long, overnight layover.","Edmonton, Canada","WanderingBrunette</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",99,4.0

The room is super clean (built in the Fall 2014) and amenities are luxurious (crib for infant and Mikimoto shower elements). Breakfast option is well worth the price.

The entrance of the hotel lobby is just a 2-3 minute walk to the check in counter at Haneda Int'l Terminal. Connected to the terminal lobby. The monorail station is also located nearby in the terminal and only about 20 minutes to downtown Tokyo - Hamamatsu station. So all very convenient. My primary reason for staying at this hotel was due to a morning Int'l departure that I didn't want to fight the crowded train to get to Haneda and staying at the terminal was perfect!I have one negative comment about the hotel check in policy. I arrived at the front desk just about 2pm on the day of check in and had to pay ¥1,000 ($10.00) to be able to go to my room prior to the 3pm check in policy. Coming in from a domestic Japan flight I figured it was worth the ¥1000 yen and paid it. The odd thing is I had a suitcase delivered to the hotel when I arrived at Narita a few days before and that bag was already sitting in my room (which is a good thing) but to having to pay to access a room 1 hour prior to check in I thought was unacceptable and a little ""nickle-and-dime"" for a Japanese hotel. I travel extensively and this is the first time ever having to pay extra for a room that was already ready for me just to abide by the 3pm check in policy. So be sure you check in on or after 3pm or be ready to pay even if your room is sitting available and ready should you arrive early.Wifi is very slow but it works. Aside from the check in policy/charge and slow wifi this property is very clean and well kept for a 1 year old hotel.","Seattle, Washington","SeattlePoidog</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",13,5.0

Sadly there is a mirror in front of the window which blocks the view and condensation builds on the window which also blocks the view when you take a shower. So sadly I didn't get much of a view except for a hazy JAL or ANA jet parked outside the window. The shower is fantastic with a decent flow through the shower head and the bath is a decent size. The usual amenities and shower toilet are provided. I found the bed comfortable and I didn't mind the pillow, I managed to get a decent sleep for every night I was there. Premium floor rooms come with a better view (probably better out of a room that doesn't have the window in the bathroom only), a pod coffee machine, free bottles of water and vouchers for various other facilities at the hotel. I didn't try the hotel restaurant but I did search around the food court next to the hotel and there is a decent range there. However Haneda is about 15 minutes from both Shinagawa and Hamamatsucho stations which all have restaurants and take away too. Access to and from the hotel is fairly easy. If you are arriving at the airport it is found in the international terminal on the departures level. If you are arriving from elsewhere you can transfer at Shinagawa or Keikyu-Kamata and take the Keikyu line to the terminal. If you are using a JR Rail Pass the Tokyo Monorail is included in the pass so head to Hamamatsucho on JR and then transfer to the Monorail and hop off at International Terminal. A very nice hotel and it is recommended especially when transiting and you don't wish to travel too far :-) ","Canberra, Australia","ToddM971</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",24,4.0

Okay, after browsing both English/Japanese reservation menu, found two things, 1). He was wrong, Japanese web site indicate no extra charge for kid without additional bed, 2) English menu always show higher price than Japanese. So I booked a room for 2 adults.We have checked in around 10:30 pm and a receptionist also say no extra charge for kid who does not use extra bed. I felt his respond was little bit rude somehow.

For starters, the hotel has a modern minimalist appeal. It is conveniently located on the 3rd floor inside Haneda Airport’s International terminal which is near the departure area. The subway system was also nearby so it was easy and cheap to get to areas like Shibuya, Shinjuku, etc. It was about 45 minutes of travel time during busy hours. Considering it was at the airport, the noise level was not a problem. The customer service was good overall. The receptionist was super friendly and spoke good English. Plus, there was no lineup during check-in making it super-fast. In terms of room features, the free Wi-Fi worked flawlessly, the lighting system was high-tech and their toilet system has enhanced capabilities. I’ve never thought I’d get excited using a toilet until I’ve used this one. Room amenities also included a safe box, fridge, kettle, alarm clock, bathrobes, slippers, tooth brushes, combs, shavers, shampoo and conditioner, soap, body wash, etc. Another great feature is the vending machine on our floor which sold beer for about a dollar or two (100 – 300 yen). Now for the caveats, the room was fairly small and the mattress was too firm for my liking so I had trouble sleeping. Also, only two pillows were provided and I need a side pillow. For this reason, five stars will not be rewarded.

The staff was very helpful and transferred our reservation so we could stay at the transit hotel instead of schlepping through immigration and customs to get to the proper hotel.Though the full hotel is cheaper as reservations are by full day vs transit hotel which is by hours, the cost came to about the same as we only had about 10-11 hours for stay due to transit security, etc.The rooms are very clean and comfortable, though on the small side. The hotel also provides free snacks, tea, coffee and hot soup, which is nice. In addition, there are plenty of food options on the airside terminal. Some shops are open 24 hours. It was definitely a fun experience to leave the handbags, etc. at the hotel and explore the airside terminal leisurely without having to worry about catching a flight.

No place to set up your laptop and work in room. Just work on bed. -Difficult to find an electrical outlet.-Weird ""appliances"" in the room.

Actually, this hotel is literally a part of Haneda airport terminal itself. So if you want to go inside, you have to come up to the 3rd floor of the terminal and enter. As far as I know, there's no entrance on the ground floor which is a bit annoying. If not, my bad. However, rooms of this hotel is quite big when compared to hotels with similar room fare that are located in the middle of Tokyo. And, because it's the Haneda airport, so connectivity to downtown Tokyo or anywhere near is not bad at all. You can use cab, train or bus as you want. Morning buffet was so and so but not bad. And surprisingly, I couldn't hear any noise from outside. So took a good rest. All in all, a better choice for the people who has some knowledge and experiences about metropolitan Tokyo and wants to stay near airport with a bit bigger (relatively) room.","Seoul, South Korea","helldivers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong>",27,3.0
