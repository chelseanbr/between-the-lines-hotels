Bedding and toiletries provided including pajamas and slippers. Only downfall is other customer snoring and talking. Eye masks are ear plugs provided. If youâ€™re a light sleeper this may not work. Perhaps opt for your private room. ,"Ayase, Japan","hoaimyw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ayase, Japan</strong>",28,5.0

I can point out a lot of good things about this hotel. What I was excited the most was that there were a lot of beauty appliances such as face massager, head massager, foot massager, face steamer etc. They were so nice and made me reluxed. As hotel is only for women, I felt safety during my stay. I should come back to syay for using more appliances!",,ANN_TYO,0,5.0
