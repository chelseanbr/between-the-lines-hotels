My husband and I and our 2 closest friends came up for 2 nights to see Hugh Jackman at the Garden. Vanessa, the hotel concierges was so helpful in arranging a driver for us. Our friend fell and broke her elbow on the day of the concert and had to go to hospital. The front desk clerks and Vanessa did everything to accommodate them. So kind and compassionate. Seth the doorman was extremely helpful also. He directed us to The Blue Bar after the concert that proved to be what we all needed after her accident. It ended up to be a fun evening. Kudos to Lenny our driver too. This man went out of his way to help us. I give all of them a huge high five. We will always stay at the Iroquois!

As a bonus, we were greeted warmly at reception and in our room with congratulations on our birthday/anniversary with a bottle of Prosecco -- a very nice touch. Every morning when we left the people at the desk wished us happy exploring and were happy to see us when we returned, asking us about our day.

Let’s start with the good things. The location is phenomenal. The hotel is between 5 and 6 Ave right by Bryant Park. The lobby smells wonderful. The doormen are very nice. The suite was big. The bathroom was also very large,I love that it had a little window and that the floors were heated. The room temp. and cleanliness were a 5. There was turn down service in the evening. Large windows in the suite. The reasons I won’t give the hotel above 4 stars- the elevator was tiny and took a very long time. We were on the 5th floor and often took the stairs. The lobby is small and the elevator is by the front desk and the people atthe front desk rarely spoke to us as we waited for the elevator or as we came in. The Lantern bar was open and popular, Friday night when we arrived, and we never saw it open again. I liked the room a lot, so if you are looking for a really good hotel room, I highly recommend it. If you are looking for more amenities and movement in a hotel this one isn’t the one. ","Miami, Florida","ACairoU</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",32,4.0

The staff is excellent(JJ at the door is awesome),the rooms are spotlessly clean with great beds, VERY quiet room, heated bathroom floors, and the most amazing shower ever! I’d give this property a strong 5, but the ventilation system(or smoking policy)needs improvement. When we returned from dinner last night, it smelled like someone had been smoking in our room. I notified the front desk so that we wouldn’t be charged a cleaning fee. Tonite as I’m laying here in bed, there is cigarette smoke coming through the vents from another room. The front desk says they think they know which room it is coming from, but that room won’t answer the phone. They offered for us to change rooms, but I’m not going to wake my husband at 11pm to change rooms. I do think a strong knock on the culprit’s door is in order.

Searching for a hotel in mid-winter, I was delighted to find that the Iroquois was a bit more flexible regarding cancellations than the others -- coming from the northern snow belt, that could have been very important. Not only that, but the Iroquois has been recently renovated, and also offered a three-night special package. The hotel was convenient (well, we knew that), the staff were courteous and helpful, and we found the lighting and climate control in our room to be well designed and functional. Really, there was nothing to criticize, although we were sad to discover that the former restaurant in the hotel had been closed.

I found the Iroquois on line and the location was excellent for our needs - mid town, quiet street, lovely facility, great area for anything you wanted to do. I called for a reservation and have never found a receptionist as helpful, resourceful, and patient as the woman with whom I spoke. We were not disappointed when we arrived at the Iroquois - in fact, it exceeded our expectations from the moment we entered the lobby - We were greeted warmly at the front door by the doormen every time we cane and left for the day - to the desk personnel who registered us and showed us to our room, to the concierge who recommended some of the most wonderful restaurants - 3 of them on 44th Street - the room was very quiet and the bed comfortable (would love to have one for our home) and the housekeeping was impeccable. Our room was small and at first we thought we would like to move to a larger room, but actually decided not to do that - we were comfortable and it was cozy. The widows actually open to allow fresh air if you want and the heating unit was responsive if we wanted more or less heat. Upon arriving home, I discovered I had left (or lost ) a sweater and upon contacting the Iroquois, was informed not only had they found it but were mailing it to me.

Quite enjoyed the heated bathroom floors and in the Iroquois Suite the steam shower. It's also nice to have windows in the bathroom for the natural light.I agree with most of the reviews that the absence of a coffee maker or tea kettle does dilute the overall guest experience, but we did bring our own kettle and mugs, so it wasn't much of a problem for us. We did have a Nespresso machine in our Iroquois Suite, but there were no capsules or coffee cups provided, so the device served no purpose. Also, there was a dining room table but no tableware, so we made do with paper and plastic from take-away places.Appreciate the chocolates left on the bed each night during turn-down service but would have to say housekeeping needs to pay more bit attention to service details as we had a couple of hiccups, but none severe enough to elaborate here.We've enjoyed our last 2 stays so much that we've already booked our stay for 2021 and look forward to returning then.","Atlanta, GA","jayandglenn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, GA</strong>",0,5.0

It has been completey renovated in a contemporary style although I miss the library off the lobby, which has been turned into a small space for relaxing. The restaurant was under renovation when I was there but there is a bar adjoining the lobby.Pros: I stayed in a ""Superior"" room. It was small but adequate for one person. It may be cramped for two. The furniture is attractive and very good quality. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom is an adequate size with good shelf space. The bathroom floor is heated (nice touch!) although there was no instruction card and I couldn't figure out how to work the controls (I had to ask at the front desk). There was a walk-in closet with an ironing board, iron, safe, bathrobe and slippers. The front desk staff is exceptionally friendly, polite and caring, knowledgeable about nearby restaurants and always willing to help. I was offered a glass of prosecco or a bottle of water on check-in. There was wine and cheese in the lobby for guests on the Thursday night I was there. Cons: I asked for a quiet room on a higher floor away from the elevators. My room had a small window over the bed with a view of a fire escape and the back of another building. I asked if there was a room with a better view available. None of the rooms have great views because the hotel is sandwiched between buildings. I was told that any other room wouldn't be as quiet so I stayed where I was. Heat throughout the space was not uniform. The window in the walk-in closet was old so the closet was cold and my clothes were cold when I took them out. The window in the shower stall also was old so the stall was cold until the hot water warmed it up. The heating system was loud when it cycled on. None of these were deal breakers for me and I would stay here again.","Albany, New York","37dianah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albany, New York</strong>",3,4.0

We upgraded to a Superior King Room which had an absolutely enormous bed. The room and bathroom were a good size and very well soundproofed, we didn't hear any other guest's TVs, showers, conversations or footsteps unless they walked directly past our door. The internet was strong and we had usb chargers in our bedside tables-a great touch, as was the heated bathroom floor. Our room was at the back of the hotel so we didn't have a view like some people have said but we really only used it to sleep in and prefer peace and quiet so it didn't bother us, neither did the lack of tea or coffee making facilities in the room, although the front desk staff did say we were welcome to come to the lobby for complimentary hot drinks and water. We thought this was a really good compromise by the hotel considering their bar and restaurant are still under renovation.The staff were all very friendly and greeted us with a smile.

The newly renovated suite was nice and definitely value for money. Also the other rooms we booked were great. But like the suite, the entire hotel was boring in design and hard it is to understand why you would make such poor choices in color and furniture when you are updating your hotel. Amenities as a coffee maker, bottles of water in the room and fresh flowers were missing. Bathroom was tiny for a suite but functional and a had good rain shower.Staff was friendly and efficient and location is great. So far so good and a reason to come back.The hotel is renovating and we knew that, and we tried to be flexible and understanding when elevators were blocked or working crew was irritated and not very friendly when we got back after dinner. I was understanding when they wet vacuumed the hallway on the 12th floor, had noisy heat blowers in front of my suite to dry the carpet and that we were informed that the sauna and fitness was also undergoing maintenance and not accessible.This review would have been positive regardless that the complimentary wifi is not working very well and sometimes not working at all.This review turned bad when on the last night I received a letter under the door. This letter was informing all rooms and suites on the 12th floor that someone had been smoking and that management was investigating and that you would be confronted with a $350 fine if you had smoked in your room. They also asked to report if you saw someone smoking.I am a non smoker , I don’t like it when other people smoke, but I also think it is a huge mistake of management to decide to approach the issue the way they did. You sort of Make everybody a possible suspect. It leaves me with a bad taste and it is a horrible customer experience.Especially when you consider that the whole day they were wet vacuuming the hallway and then had noisy massive heat blowers in the hallway without any written heads up from management. Apparently the hotel is more busy policing the guests than they are interested to ensure the guests have a flawless experience.So purely based on this letter I most likely would not choose to stay at Iroquois in the future. I don’t like to be considered a suspect! Solve guest issues in a different way. #unprofessional #1203",Maine,"ENIAMASU</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maine</strong>",47,2.0

Old-fashioned in all the best ways - no hip trappings and funky lighting, no undisclosed 'facilities charge' (a currently fashionable scam among NYC hotels which I can only hope one day results in a class action lawsuit), just a good honest concern for the welfare of its guests. It feels like a slice of an earlier NYC.The staff are excellent - friendly, informal, always ready to help and creative in dealing with unforeseen issues. Seriously, you can ask these people for anything and they'll find a way.My room was recently refurbished and immaculately appointed in retro 1960s brown and beige, Norman Parkinson 1940s/50s Vogue photographs, enormous and wonderful tiled bathroom (with a tub - hooray), plentiful towels and thick bathrobes. Much attention has been paid to the bed (it always amazes me that so many hotels skimp on what is, after all, the main point of staying in a hotel) - it is huge and wonderfully comfortable.NB. Renovations are currently underway at The Iroquois, and so the hotel is running at half speed - no bar or restaurant. The desk staff were apologetic but clearly excited about what the place will be like once the work is done - and I share their enthusiasm. Meanwhile, the sheer charm, value, efficiency and comfort of this place is enough to merit a 5* review even without the bells and whistles.I visit NYC a lot, and have tried a lot of different hotels. In its philosophy of care and evocation of an older NYC, the hotel which the Iroquois most recalls for me is the The Mark on 77th/Madison but at ¼ the price. My only reservation is that the Times Square radius is not my favourite area of NYC, but The Iroquois can't really help that and it's going to be my regular bolt hole in Manhattan from here on.","London, UK","Crowsbill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, UK</strong>",22,5.0

Previously we’ve stayed farther out and when the theaters let out its a long, crowded haul back. Hence the decision to stay here: quick walk to and fro. We like a smaller hotel with old world charm and enjoyed our stay. As other people have noted, the renovation work makes the lobby look like an apartment building and there’s no restaurant or even drinks available (as was stated on the website). We missed having a coffee maker/tea kettle in the room. (The fridge is full of costly things we don’t drink.) A few times we had hot water brought to our room so we could make our own tea~adequate but hardly luxurious.The room itself was of good size, comfortable and quiet with a generous closet with shelving and a safe. Bathroom was exceptionally nice: very roomy with useful shelves and extra long towel bars. A make up mirror and windows that open also a bonus. Staff we encountered seemed friendly although some were new and not that knowledgeable. I wanted to try the sauna but it was closed. To print boarding passes I had to email the front desk so they could print them.Location was great. Easy to walk or take the bus and/or subway to places of interest. Found nice (but expensive) restaurants close by to eat. I look forward to seeing the renovation of this lovely place completed to provide a more comprehensive hotel experience.

We wanted to stay in a different location a few blocks way than our first hotel. A couple of days before we arrived we checked trip advisor for location & nearby restaurants. We discovered there was building work. Upon arrival met by the doorman who accommodated our luggage. Checkin smooth.The lobby was very small due to the construction and only one elevator. There was no water or coffee facilities reception. Our room on the third floor was two queen beds. Very tastefully decorated and a nice compact bathroom. However we did have a lot of luggage this proved tricky as the room was quiet small. There was a stocked mini bar & on top a tray with snacks. However no coffee machine or free water. I feel that a hotel of this standard could take away the snack tray & provide a krups coffee machine and water. The room was at the end of a corridor and therefore relatively quiet.We were not notified at all by our third party booking agent Hotels.com that this hotel was under renovation. I would recommend this hotel when the building work is complete. ,"Swinton, United Kingdom","shell048</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Swinton, United Kingdom</strong>",6,4.0

Also noted, if you needed a fridge in your room for other items to store, guests would be accommodated. We ordered one and a small fridge was delivered to the room and turned on.Other comments about the room include shades and drapes that kept the room quite dark out when it was light outside. This was very nice. The beds were very comfortable with 4 large pillows on our king bed. The only small inconvenience was ice needed to be ordered each time vs. having a machine located somewhere in the hotel for self-serve. Also, there was a lobby / restaurant renovation going on while we were there which only allowed for one elevator to be in service.

On arrival the staff could not have been more helpful and welcoming, so no complaints whatsoever with the staff. The hotel itself was not at all as was expected. The details here on TA suggest that the hotel has two bars and a restaurant. Well it might have had a while ago, they’re currently under refurb. Not just one of them. All of them. So if you want breakfast then you need to book with their ‘partner’ hotel next door, remember to chat to your mortgage advisor before leaving home though as you’re going to need the cash. Also, when you get back late at night from enjoying a show on broadway or the best Italian meal ever in Greenwich Village, don’t expect to grab a night cap, there’s NO bar, except the mini one in your room of course (don’t forget to consult that mortgage advisor). So never mind, there may not be a restaurant for breakfast, at least you can make yourself a coffee or tea in the morning with the ubiquitous tea and coffee making facilities in the room......oh hold on...... there’s none of those either..... really? ..... really?

But the shower was fine with good water pressure. The heated bathroom tiles were a nice touch. Each afternoon they'd put out a free alcoholic beverage...bottle of wine or a rum punch. My main gripe is I'm a big coffee guy. No coffee maker in the room and they only put coffee out in the morning (which wasn't very good). Free coffee all day is always a nice perk I like at a hotel, but not a deal breaker. Front desk and door staff were very kind.

Our booking made on 1st February for a 3 night stay commencing 24th July gave absolutely no warning that the hotel would be undergoing major refurbishment. No subsequent message was sent warning us that aside from a gym, there would be absolutely no facilities available on site. The breakfast advertised at additional cost had to be taken at another hotel nearby. There was no functioning bar or café and the restaurant had a sign saying “Re-opening Summer 2019”! There were sounds of banging and drilling during the daytime. During our stay, the hotel had only one functioning elevator for guests over 12 floors leading to waiting times of several minutes. We have stayed in New York on many occasions and our “Deluxe King Room” was one of the smallest of our many stays. The bathroom was tiny. Perhaps the clue is in the first word of the group title “Small Leading Hotels”. The room had the smallest closet I have ever seen which held precisely 9 hangers sideways on. No adequate room for setting up suitcases and no room to store clothes if you’re staying more than a few days. I used my case situated on the floor as a wardrobe taking care not to trip over it.

We were 1 of 2 couples traveling together for the 4th of July weekend. We finally decided on the Iroquois because I called in and had the pleasure of speaking to Kristoff. It is difficult to find someone willing to answer your questions and act as though they want to be of assistance. I booked this hotel based on this interaction with Kristoff and how nice and helpful he was.We arrived and were greeted warmly by Kristoff and another lady. They promptly checked us in, Our rooms were ready, They had even put both rooms on the same floor. They also offered us a glass of prosecco (Which they had available at the front desk 24/7).The room was very clean and recently updated. I would not say it was spacious, but it certainly was not small and there was plenty of room for the 2 of us. The decor was stylish and the heated tile floor in the bathroom was a nice touch. The linens were high quality (Frette) and the bed was comfortable. Our room was also nice and quiet on the 8th floor. I would definitely recommend a room away from the elevator because it might not be so quiet there.The location is very close to Times Square and the theater district. Fantastic location really, because you could walk to so many attractions in just a few minutes, but not have to deal with the shoulder to shoulder crowds on the sidewalk or the street noise.The real highlight here is the employees. As nice as the hotel was, the staff out-shined all the other wonderful attributes of the Iroquois. I wish I would have written this as soon as I returned home, because I am unfortunately failing to remember some of the other names I wanted to mention.The concierge- sweet girl who offered our friend her Blink182 ticket which we could not take her up on. Very friendly and engaging.Night time desk clerk- Oliver maybe? Always smiling and greeted us so warmly when we came in late in the evening and always offered us bottled water to take up to the room. There was another employee, I am not sure what his position was but I think his name was JJ, also always chatty and smiling. In fact, we did not encounter one single employee there that was not doing a great job and making us feel welcome.In the lobby, they always have something out for the guests. In the morning it was coffee and tea, throughout the day it was iced water and juice, and in the evening it was iced water, juice, an alcoholic beverage of punch or wine, etc. They also had fruit and Hershey kisses. Speaking of the lobby....yes, the main lobby, Lantern's Keep, and restaurant are being remodeled so the makeshift lobby is small and unremarkable. That being said, it was still fine and designed well to isolate the construction which we never heard or saw. I do hope I get to go back and see everything once it is complete.Great job, Iroquois..... you guys are definitely getting it right!!!!","Richmond, Virginia","350kellyr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",86,5.0

Recently my wife and I made our semi-annual visit to New York City to see a Broadway show (Come From Away), attend a concert at MSG (Billy Joel's 70th birthday bash), eat some great food (Oyster Bar at Grand Central Station and Keen's Steakhouse) and tour a few museums (911 Memorial and the Natural History Museum). The one thing about The Big Apple is that it never disappoints and is the very definition of world class. With that in mind I wanted to stay at a hotel that would live up to that billing without forcing me into bankruptcy at the same time. We found it at The Iroquois. Here's why.Manhattan is a big island with a zillion things to do and see. You can take the subway quite reasonably to get anywhere on it and we use it a lot when we are in the city, but if I have a preference it is to walk. Only by walking can you really appreciate why New York City is, like London, Paris and Rome, a city that has a unique vibe of its own. That is why my first choice is always to stay in Midtown Manhattan. That's where you'll find Times Square, the Broadway theatre district, Madison Square Garden, the famous shops of 5th Avenue, etc., etc. etc. However, the last thing I want in a hotel is to be too close to the swarming crowds that can be claustrophobic at times. The Iroquois has a perfect location on West 44th between 5th Avenue and The Avenue of the Americas, two blocks from Times Square. The street is relatively quiet, but only a few minutes walk from Broadway. I've stayed in well over a dozen different hotels in NYC and none has had a better location than The Iroquois.I also like a little history in my hotels and The Iroquois has that as well. It is just coming up on 120 years of age and for most of its existence doubled as an apartment/hotel with a number of luminaries as residents. James Dean lived here for two years. For a while in the 1980's it featured a cabaret restaurant run by the legendary Jan Wallman who jump started the careers of Woody Allen, Rodney Dangerfield, Barbra Streisand and Joan Rivers among many others. More recently the larger apartments were converted into what is now a 120 room boutique hotel.The rooms at The Iroquois are quite typical of most New York City hotels, or at least the ones that ordinary mortals can afford. They are not large, but they are luxurious.Like all SLH hotels, the mattresses, linens and toiletries were excellent. I wasn't cracked about the minibar which had virtually no room to store our own beverages, but that was easily solved by having our own mini fridge brought up at no extra charge.The bathroom had a heated marble floor and a really good shower with a great flow of water. That should be a given in any good hotel, but believe me, it's not. Also, I liked the fact that you didn't need to be an Einstein to figure out how to work the darn thing.You can have the best built hotel in the world with the greatest amenities, but it doesn't mean a thing if the staff are not up to snuff. If they are surly or treat you as if you are an interloper or obviously expect huge tips for the most nominal of tasks, it will ruin the experience. The staff at The Iroquois were none of these. Many of them have worked here for decades. They were uniformly exactly what you would expect from a quality hotel - polite without being obsequious, friendly without pretense and there when you needed them. As an example, after checking in I could not locate my cell phone and figured I'd left it in the car which was now somewhere in the offsite valet parking garage. One of the guys on duty accompanied me the two blocks to the garage and we had a great chat about the city and life in general there and back.On Tuesday's and Thursday's there is a manager's reception from five to six. These are not uncommon these days, but usually they are quite parsimonious with the spirits. Not so at The Iroquois where the glasses were refilled by the chap in the picture above as soon as they were half empty. He seemed genuinely determined to make sure everybody was having a good time and by six we definitely were.One thing The Iroquois has that is quite unique is complimentary walking tours six days a week in conjunction with Streetwise New York that start at six different hotels in Manhattan. On Sunday's the tour starts at The Iroquois and features highlights of Midtown Manhattan including Bryant Park, Grand Central Station and the New York Public Library. On other days you can make you way to other hotels and visit TriBeCa, Hell's Kitchen, the Upper West Side, NoMad and Times Square.One thing I should mention for anyone who might be thinking of staying at The Iroquois in the next few months is that there are renovations taking place on the ground floor. The hotel's restaurant and lounge is currently closed.  That's not a hardship because there are tons of great eating and drinking places nearby, but the hotel is also offering a food service from famed chef Daniel Boulud's db Bistro Moderne which is literally right next door. For cocktails try the Blue Bar at The Algonquin which is just two doors down. Finally, if you want more than just a coffee for breakfast go just a few steps farther to The Red Flame Diner which is as New York as you can get and could easily be mistaken for the fictional Monk's from Seinfeld.I've stayed in many hotels that are under renovation and it can easily ruin the vacation if the noise and construction dust are not controlled. I can honestly say that if they didn't tell you that there were renovations going on, you wouldn't notice it. There was no noise and no dust. In fact, for a New York City hotel The Iroquois is extremely quiet. I now have a reason to return when the revamped restaurant and lounge open in the late summer or early fall.So, in conclusion, The Iroquois easily lived up to my expectations as an SLH member hotel","Nova Scotia, Canada","maritimeexplorer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nova Scotia, Canada</strong>",1060,5.0

The Iroquois is an historic hotel located on a quiet side street in the heart of Midtown. Times Square, Bryant Park, and Grand Central are all an easy walk. The building itself is a beauty, twelve stories tall with a great facade. The service was awesome; Vanessa the concierge reached out prior to my trip via email and offered assistance. Upon entering my room I was surprised with a basket of beer and some cupcakes! Vanessa had wrote a note and provided the welcoming gifts. This kind of service makes a difference! My room was clean and well organized. The toiletry products are supplied by C.O. Bigelow. The size of the room is comfortable by Manhattan standards. The beds and linens are of high quality. The windows open partially which allow fresh air. All of the staff at the front desk, doormen, etc. were extremely professional. There is complimentary coffee & tea in the common area every morning. If you are looking for a classy stay in NYC check out the Iroquois. ","Delray Beach, Florida","bartg586</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Delray Beach, Florida</strong>",14,5.0

We knew the Iroquois was perfectly located, being very close to Times Square, Broadway shows, restaurants, Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave. and main lines on the subway. However, we hadn't expected the Iroquois to be a place of great warmth and kindness, after losing my wallet in the cab on our way into the city from the airport before 9 a.m. The Front Office manager, Christoph Duerrbeck, was so gracious and helpful, showing us that all the banks connected to our credit cards were a few blocks away, having housekeeping get our room ready quickly so we could relax, and even asking days later if the wallet had been found. He has a wonderful staff which truly made us feel like the hotel was home.  They have recently upgraded the rooms, which have very comfortable beds and beautiful spotless bathrooms. We appreciated how they set aside a small space in the mini fridges for guests to store their own water and how efficient and unobtrusive the housekeepers were. Since we were out most of the time, we did not mind that there is no view from the windows, and it was extremely quiet.The Iroquois would have undoubtedly been more pricey but we got better rates due to a remodel of the lobby, which does not affect the guests at all because it has been walled off. We would recommend getting a slightly larger room if you are staying for a longer period. We thought our Premium King was worth the difference. We loved being able to walk to our 2 Broadway shows and the restaurants nearby. The only places we used the subway for were the 9 11 Memorial and Hudson Yards, which were very easy to get to from the subways nearby. New York can be a impersonal place. We have stayed in many different areas of NYC in our many travels there.

I subsequently stayed at several excellent properties who then decided they would build on their growing popularities by adding a “resort” fee or “amenity charge”. I have made it a matter of principle to refuse to stay in these hotels always letting them know that they should be ashamed for charging what they should be including in the first place. I find it the worst of scams.Happily the Iroquois, which I must admit to missing staying at, does not indulge in such subterfuge (and hopefully never will) and I am happy to report that not only now does it compare as favourably with many of those same hotels, but it provides an even higher standard overall and at a relatively lower and more reasonable rateThis was my second visit in the last 3 months and both times my visits were excellent and very comfortable. First the staff are exemplary and make you feel welcome and appreciated in every encounter. Being a light sleeper I always request a quiet room at the back of the hotel away from the street. Though the view is non-existent from the windows, it still allows you to see what the weather is doing but more importantly you don’t hear a thing except maybe on the rare occasion in the evening or morning when thoughtless empty headed entitled fellow guests slam their doors when entering or leaving their rooms or decide to screech at each other while they are awaiting the elevators in the hallway in what they think are normal speaking voices. Happily the refurbishment of the compact rooms includes the ability to control the temperature in the room where before it was centrally regulated. Also a great improvement is the fridge in the room which allows you to store your own beverages as it is an honour bar (how very civilized as opposed to those monstrosities that charge you in a heartbeat should you make the mistake of jostling anything) . The lighting in the room is also greatly improved and the bathroom with its rain shower head and great water pressure is a joy. The crowning achievement is the incredibly comfortable bed in which I sleep like a rock in with its wonderful linens and pillows. Also the internet is solid, consistent and strong. There are still no coffee or tea making facilities in the room ( one would be hard-pressed to find room for them though the room does not feel cramped at all) however there is delicious fresh coffee available in the lobby every morning which can be brought back to the room.I am so happy to have rediscovered the Iroquois after staying at pretty much every property on the block where it stands going all the way back to my first stay at The Royalton back in 1972 then after its makeover where the large spacious rooms were transformed into trendy little dark boxes, at the Algonquin before its myriad takeovers and renovations, then The Sofitel…etc. However now that I think back overall I still prefer the Iroquois as, pardon the clichè it really does feel like going home.",Ontario,"Loudlyintrepid</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ontario</strong>",382,5.0

Most recently we have been given the opportunity for extended back to back annual visits. (2018 and 2019.) Each time I have enjoyed my visit but as noted by other travelers, the pattern of on-going property renovation is beginning to wear. I appreciate the management's/owner's efforts to stay current and relevant but I am beginning to wonder about the advertised qualities of ""quaint and historic."" Yes the building is old but everything else seems to be going by the way side. There is currently no on-site library, restaurant or Lantern's Keep bar. Photos have been displayed for upcoming new facilities but everything from the past appears to be rapidly disappearing. Quite honestly, one of the reasons I was drawn to the Iroquois was its ability to appreciate the past. Now, as I look at the artist renderings and ponder the Iroquois' future, I am unable to understand how the changes will continue to make this property ""quaint""? The displayed artist's renderings show a design style which can be found in a lot of other New York and world wide properties. Even with all of the changes, the service at the Iroquois is generally fantastic. John is fabulous at getting you a taxi, Vanessa knows her city, and the front desk maintains a smile at all hours of the day! The room cleaning services, however, are not exceptional. With each of my past stays, my family has experienced the phenomena of finding items on the bathroom floors from previous residents. (Gross.) Each time we have been graciously offered an alternative but really, when will someone in upper management deal with the bigger issue of quality control? I have recommended the Iroquois to family members and would not hesitate to do so again. I would hope, however, that the powers that be will regard their visitors with a touch more respect. The renovations and sprucing up are splendid but please have the courtesy of giving your guests, especially those that book well in advance, notice of pending interruptions to service. I would also like to think that a facility such as the Iroquois will treat their employees in a fair and gracious way but I am not sure this happened with the sudden closing of the on-site facilities.

No request was too big or too small. Christoph is an unusually caring and knowledgeable man, and our daily conversations were a highlight of our stay. We usually choose the Sofitel, right next door: a grander, more modern hotel but distinctly lacking in the warmth and care we enjoyed at the Iroquois.

So close to everything (Times Square, Theater District, shopping, restaurants) yet the minute you walk inside you feel removed from it all. Throughout my stay I was greeted with friendly smiles and helpful service from everyone I encountered (doormen, front desk, concierge, housekeeping). I stayed in a premier king room. It was smallish but clean, updated, tastefully decorated, and had everything I needed (except for maybe a coffeemaker). The bed and pillows were amazingly comfortable and I never heard ANY street noise. After long, hectic days running around and nights at the theater, my cozy room was a welcome relief. Ahhhhh..... Loved the ""library"" room for morning coffee and perusing the paper. I had the ""breakfast package"" as part of my SLH membership. I would not recommend it. There are much better breakfast options (service, food quality and value) right in the neighborhood. But other than that, I loved everything else about the hotel: the boutique size, wonderful staff, comfortable accommodations, and perfect location. After staying in countless large and small hotels throughout the city, the Iroquois is definitely my new home away from home in NYC. I look forward to coming back soon (minus the breakfast package).

I would say the bathroom is small, but layout is very well designed so it does not feel that way.Breakfast menu was not extensive, but food was well prepared and restaurant staff very amiable and helpful. The Lantern bar is cosy and worth a visit.My biggest gripe is the extensive use of brown in the bedroom decor - carpets, woodwork, and even the wallpaper had brown stripes. Perhaps that contributes to the feeling that the room is a little small.2 other gripes is that the closets are hard to get into and although a mini bar is provided and there is a cabinet for a fridge, there is no fridge, and therefore no cold beer while working on that later night report.A colleague had noise issues in his room, but I had no such problems.

I always sleep well here, the beds are super comfortable and I rarely hear traffic noise. The other reason I always pick this place is because of the location. Bryant Park/42nd Street Subway is just a couple of minutes walk away so it is easy to get Uptown/Downtown or to Brooklyn. Times Square is about 8 minutes walk with a large amount of Subway lines. 5th Av is right at the end of the street for all the fancy stores. Herald Square (Macy’s and less expensive stores) is 10 minutes walk. Breakfast is good value at the Red Flame diner a couple of doors down the road (opens 6am) for those who are jet-lagged!

What can I say that hasn't already been said. One thing is for certain the Americans certainly know how to do customer services and hospitality - The Iroquois staff were nothing but great to us. As a family visiting from the UK we were greeted with and treated with nothing but kindness and friendliness. This started the second we pulled up in our taxi where we were greeted by Seth on the door. On hearing our accents he pointed me in the direction of all the nearest bars where I could watch the champions league final. We checked in with a smile from the reception staff who arranged for our bags to be taken our room. The rooms could be seen as a bit on the small side but that was far from an issue for us; It had 2 comfy double beds, a TV and bathroom. It was comfortable, clean and well looked after - what more do you need. You don't travel to New York to sit in your room and we didn't; it was simply somewhere to rest your head.We didn't use the facilities; bar, restaurant, gym etc but what we saw of them they seemed spot on. We took advantage of the free Wi-Fi (no need to pay for the superfast; the free one was fine). Despite there being a coffee shop on virtually every corner in New York the hotel provided coffee in the library every morning.On our last day we checked out at 12pm and spent our last day sightseeing. The staff looked after our bags (locked away) and let us use the gym to shower and change before arranging a taxi to the airport.Quite simply this hotel was excellent which is down to the staff.

These are the reasons why: 1) Location, location, location. The location of the hotel is fantastic. Times Square is two blocks away, Rockefeller 3 blocks away, the Grand Central station is around the corner, Whole Foods Market at the corner of Bryant Park plus many many more shops and eateries. Just Google its locality and see it for yourself. 2) ServiceThe staff is warm and friendly, in particular, the Doormen. They are always smiling, helpful, friendly and professional at the same time. The hotel offers a free walking tour like most of the hoteliers but not on every day hence check with the receptionist. 3) RoomsThe room is modernly furnished with fantastic bedding and pillows. The soft lights in the room are warm and welcoming. Unfortunately, I had a room on the 3rd floor and with no view, it faces the back of another building, up close. My window shutters were shut the entire time hence no natural light as office workers can see right into the room. I had no fridge too hence if you get a room on the 3rd floor, perhaps ask for a room with a view and a fridge. The WIFI connection in the room is a little sketchy, not good enough for video voice call.

On top of the customer service, the location is outstanding for NYC. The hotel has a great bar which was exceptional. The restaurant was great as well. We had dinner one night and breakfast each morning. We stayed in a Premium King, which I thought was a little small, but for NYC, it was probably large. Enough room for the two of us. Room was quiet as I requested. No problems with elevators as I have heard others complain about a other location in NYC.

Upon arrival -- my second visit -- I was given an upgrade on my room, which was a lovely surprise. The room was wonderful, and I can only hope to get it again sometime! The toiletries in the bathroom were very nice and came in handy. I wish the mini bar stocked scotch, but that would be my only complaint!A big plus is the concierge, Vanessa. I don't think there is anything she doesn't know or doesn't know how to obtain. I needed new shoelaces that wouldn't keep coming untied, and she directed me to a tiny shoe-repair place down the street that fixed me right up. She is a gem. The restaurant staff are also wonderful -- friendly, attentive and professional. I finally got to have a drink in the tiny Lantern Keep cocktail lounge -- it's expensive to drink in New York, and it's very expensive to drink here. But I had to experience it at least once!! Glad I did; the bar staff were also very friendly, and the room is lovely. I had drinks before the theater, and that turned out to be a good idea because the lounge gets crowded later.Everyone on the staff deserves a nod for their great attitudes and friendliness. From the bellmen to the front-desk staff, everyone conspires to make your visit a great one! They succeeded as far as I'm concerned!

They know our names, our preferences, and they go so far beyond anything we could ever expect of staff members. These are special folks with an unyielding commitment to satisfying their guests. They have never failed!Over the sixteen years and more than twenty five stays at the Iroquois we have known more than a few General Managers, but none have been as thoughtful, focused and professional as Breandon Gallagher. Leadership counts and his is at the top.Again, a great hotel, but again, to paraphrase and old saying: it is one that makes you feel that you at home in a place away from home.Jim B, SSI, GA",SE Georgia,"jim b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>SE Georgia</strong>",6,5.0

Everyone made our stay feeling like ""coming home"", because everyday there was big dispenser of ice water with fresh mint or lemon, and every evening there was a bowl of fresh strawberries at the front counter. The Concierge manager Bill was very helpful and knowledgeable in recommending nice restaurants and attractions to visit around Manhattan, as well as very thoughtful in helping us organizing our fine dining experience. One night, my mom and I had a a late dinner reservation and were worried about getting to and back from the restaurant at that hour.

You really are in the middle of everything so whether you rate shopping, museums, or the shows as your holiday priority, it is all on your doorstep. The nearby subway stations of Port Authority and Grand Central take you up or down town when you want to venture further afield or the walking is too much. Amenities wise, the beds are very comfortable, nice linens etc, essentially all the refinements you expect from an SLH establishment. The hotel has a quaint period feel to it and you are treated warmly by all the employees which adds to the charm. We didn't need much from anyone whilst we were there but any issues or queries were dealt with promptly. A big shout out has to go to Seth, one of the doormen, who is a real credit to the hotel and manages the balance of attentiveness and just getting on and doing the job very well. Apparently the hotel is in the process of refurbishment and I will say that it needs to as in places it is showing wear . Our room, a Premium King, was roomy enough with a nicely appointed bathroom (gorgeously hot shower!), but clean and well maintained as it was, the general furnishings and carpets are tired and in need of a lift and I would expect more from an SLH property.All said, a great stay in a classic Midtown location allowing New York to weave it's festive magic so many thanks to all at the Iroquois!","Aberdeenshire, United Kingdom","ocean66</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aberdeenshire, United Kingdom</strong>",22,4.0

We previously stayed at a hotel across the street, but wanted to try a different one for this stay. The check-in staff was kind and helpful, very welcoming. There are two elevators for more expedient service to and from your room. The hallways are quiet, as is the room. We had almost no noise, save for the occasional, muted siren. We had no difficulty sleeping. For a NYC hotel, the room was adequately large. The bathroom had heated floors, the guest towels were luxuriously thick, and there were plenty of in-room amenities. The hair dryer was full-size and had 6 different options. There was an in-room mini-bar fridge and they left a small bit of space for guests to use OR you could call the front desk and they'd bring a fridge just for you. Turn-down service was excellent and everyone who worked in the hotel went out of their way to ensure we had a good stay. We didn't eat at the restaurant, but we did have a drink at Lantern's Keep. It was something we'd only do once -- the cocktails were $19 each (we each had a Gin & Tonic). The drinks were good, but $19 each was a bit steep. Overall, it was an excellent experience and we'd definitely do it again. ","Damascus, Maryland","LdyluckUSA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Damascus, Maryland</strong>",0,5.0

It is perfectly placed as it is literally in the heart of everthing, but still feels like a cosy little bolt-hole as soon as you're inside. It's calming, comfortable, convenient and stylish.You can keep to yourself, or wander down to the very good bar (there's actually two, and we liked the restaraunt bar best) and chat with many guests who are on their third, fourth or fifth stay at this well kept secret of a place.Gregory's coffee right across the street and the red flame diner a couple of doors down make it easy to set yourself up for a day in the city, while the complimentary hot drinks in the lobby make it the perfect place to come back to when you've worn yourself out.We had room 908 (family room with two double beds) and it was perfect for our needs.The beds are comfy, the bathroom was amazing and the room itself was well sized and looked fantastic (we're actually still here! I'm writing this review lying in bed after a great nights sleep and waiting for my my wife and daughter to wake up!)You don't really get a view with this hotel, and in our opinion that small fact isn't enough to detract from the many wonderfull things that this place has to offer.We looked at lots of hotels prior to trip, and we've spent the last few days walking past the other choices we rejected and just nodding at each other because we know we made the right choice!To all the staff of the Iroquois (Amanda, Joanna, Billy, Seth, JJ, Bill and Thomas to name but a few)Thanks for making our trip really special.We'll definitely be back.","Staffordshire, United Kingdom","Steven K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Staffordshire, United Kingdom</strong>",0,5.0

The hotel is a classic boutique hotel in mid-town Manhattan. It's location on West 44th St. between 6th and 5th Avenues is ideal for exploring all that Manhattan has to offer - close to Times Square but far enough away from its craziness. The Iroquois belongs to the Small Luxury Hotel group and is consistent with the group's high standards. Of particular note is the staff's friendliness and willingness to serve. Seth, the Doorman/Bellman addressed my wife and I by name the second time we saw him. The front desk staff were quick to say hello and offer us water or fruit whenever we walked by. Mid-Manhattan hotels are famous for small rooms and when we first arrived our room was recently remodeled but definitely on the small side. When we mentioned the next day our disappointment with our room size the Front Desk staff (Billy and Front Desk Manager Amanda) arranged for us to move into a much more spacious room of the same category. Instead of a window overlooking an alley and the back of another building, the new room had a street view which also allowed us to see the top of the Chrysler Building (which lit up at night). The room interior (both rooms) was very clean and the remodel was quite pleasing. The bathroom was well lit (a big plus) and the turn down service was an an added benefit. There was the classic mini-bar with just a little space for personal items to keep cold. The hotel did offer (if requested) a separate small refrigerator to be brought to the room.Overall, the Iroquois was an ideal location for a Mid-Manhattan stay. The proximity to the subway allowed us to get around the city easily (we used a weekly subway/bus pass to go all over) and the theater district/Times Square was an easy stroll. We will definitely consider the Iroquois for our next Manhattan visit.","Irvine, California","rdear1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Irvine, California</strong>",9,5.0

From these experiences a strong pattern emerges. These people genuinely care about their guests. Yes, the rooms are great and the newly renovated ones are spectacular, but the staff is the key. Alex, one of many on the front desk mangers, is a signature example of how to treat a guest but that is also true of Bill, the concierge, and John, Malik and JJ who handle the doors, bags, and cabs, and it extends to every maintenance technician and housekeeper as well. They all make the stay extraordinarily personal. To us this is a Our most recent visit was in early October and we brought a thirteen year old grandson along as well. From the time we arrived until this very moment he has been persistent in his staunch praise of the hotel and the people working there that he met. He keeps asking how so many people there knew who we are and how did they remember who he was with and his name. We told him to thank the General Manager, Breandan Gallagher, because it is his leadership that ensures that such things happen.The Iroquois’s location is remarkable. It is a few blocks from Times Square, Grand Central Station and Rockefeller Center but because it is on a “Street” rather than one of the heavily trafficked “Avenues” it is not overwhelmed by tourists and an endless parade of vehicles.",SE Georgia,"jim b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>SE Georgia</strong>",6,5.0

If your activities are in midtown, this hotel provides you with a super convenient access to everything. The room decoration is sophisticated. Chic and nothing loud, but not boring. The lighting in the room was nice. Many spot lightings (vs. few large lamps) so that we could adjust the room brightness/darkness easily and just right. There is a good sound proofing on the wall. We could not hear anything coming through from the next door. However, there were noises coming through from the hallway. We heard a couple of short conversations. Not a huge problem because there are not too many rooms per floor, and the kind of people staying at the hotel are not exactly late night club goers type. The hotel cares about the guests' special occasions. At the turn-down service, they sent us a lovely plate of chocolate-covered strawberries and a bottle of red for our special day. A big thank you for the thoughtfulness! The door staff was swift with our luggages. The coffee service during the day and the infused water in the late afternoon were a nice touch.

Great choice for us. Pros:The location is nicely situated for most of what you'd like to see and do... close to theater and 5th Avenue shopping, and certainly a long pleasant walk to most everything else. Plus the street it is on is a lovely one, with several interesting buildings, clubs and spots to visit.Newly refurbished rooms provided space for everything we needed. New AC system gave us nonstop 65 degree climate our entire stay - even in the bathroom. The room looked fresh and clean and quite nice. Bedding was great. AND we adored the discreet system on the door with a small toggle that allows a housekeeper to know you wish to be left undisturbed without a sign out front or a knock on the door -- we loved that!Nightly turn down, even when we didn't leave the room until after 7:30 pm. Morning papers on the door. Breakfast delivered right on time - HOT. Plenty of towels. Quick elevators. Quiet hallways. Lovely iced water in the lobby to take with you. This seems to be a small business hotel, with nicely dressed people that were professional and orderly, which we appreciated.Cons:Not much of a view from our room, but it was very quiet!The much ballyhooed ""feeling of famly"" wasn't anything we felt, but not sure we needed it. No one knew our names, but they were friendly and helpful for sure.We'll definitely recommend and would stay again when we visit the city. We hadn't been to NYC before, but our stay here was certainly part of the successful trip. Next time we'll find time for the sauna and Lanterns Keep!I should also say that we checked in under difficult circumstances -- our credit card had been used fraudulently and was going to be closed. Front desk staff were kind enough to deal with our CC company and make arrangements allowing us to check in before closing the account.... and they helped make sure we got our replacement as soon as it arrived.

I booked online and chose the premier room, which stated it was bigger than the standard rooms. I proceeded to call the hotel after booking on their website and they advised that I had booked an accessible room, which no where on the website did it state this. I was advised many people book this room and we would be happy. Later I was told at check in, by the front desk clerk herself, that the room isn't nice and we wouldn't have been happy with it.We arrived at 9am to check in and were aware that we would not be given a room until 3pm, which is the standard check in time. The clerk at the desk took our telephone number and advised she would call if it was ready sooner. No call was ever placed and we arrived back to the hotel around 4pm to obtain our room keys. Another front desk agent now advised that the room was not yet ready and that it would be about another 10 minutes. Considering the check in policy is 3pm, I am not sure how that was even possible. We advised her that we were exhausted from travelling and waiting any further was unacceptable. She then proceeded to try and give us another room which was a lower quality then the premier room we had booked. I certainly was not going to receive a lower quality room and pay a higher price for it. The room we received was tiny and had a view of a wall and ventilation system. We were also unable to control the temperature in the room which made for a terrible sleep because it was extremely stuffy and hot. We decided upon initially entering the room that we would be checking out the next day and going elsewhere. Upon check out the price for the room did not match my quoted price given upon booking, but the clerk was unable to figure out a break down of what the 2 days we initially booked would cost.

Overall condition of room was excellent possibly down to it being recently refurbished. Small room with a massive bed didn't leave much room for accessing luggage. We were there for a 8 days and it was evident that room wasn't really dusted much if at all, imagine they'd have used the excuse of not touching our stuff if It bothered me enough to complain, can't fault the cleanliness of bathroom. Usual noise during night to be expected for New York. Mini bar over priced especially the water, doesn't matter how many stars your hotel has the bottled water shouldn't be $10 a bottle. Lack of complementary tea and coffee in room was a bit unusual and disappointing never experienced that in any other hotel I've stayed in. This review may appear a bit nitpicking and I rate our experience as very good none the less, if they address these things they'd get 5 star reviews all day long I think.

Close to Times Square, Rockefeller Center. Not too far from the Empire State building and Grand Central Station. The nearest subway appears to be in Times Square 2 blocks away. It is on a well lit street & we never felt unsafe even late at night always seemed to be a few people about. The hotel has 12 floors, 2 lifts (1 was intermittently out of service all 5 days of our stay). Some of the rooms are apparently still to be refurbished. 1207, our room had been done & it was very nicely done to. Very comfortable room, huge bed, very clean & tidy. No tea & coffee facilities in room, which would have been nice.DVD player listed but not in room, apparently removed when refurbished & replaced with option to buy new releases via the TV. DVD list of 150 films weren't new but were free. We asked for the list of films & the DVD player & both arrived by lunchtime the next day. The room details did state a fridge could be supplied upon request & we did request it before our arrival, but it did not arrive. There was a little space in the mini bar which we used. We were offered a morning paper, which never arrived until our last morning. Just so you know in case it effects your choice room 1207 has no view, office buildings & fire escapes all within a few feet of the window, but as you spend most of your time out in the city it's not a big thing to me. It cost me just under US$1400 for a 4 night stay, Thursday to Monday, seemed a little expensive. There were a few slips in service and I don't expect this with a smallish hotel, that prides itself on service & that is this expensive. I must say all the staff were very friendly, informative and tried to be helpful. The ability to safely leave our bags at the hotel all day while we were out after we had checked out was very useful. Also being able to use a computer and printer for printing boarding passes for the return journey also came in very handy. I must also say they did recognize my birthday with a complimentary dinner plate full of chocolates & strawberries along with a small bottle of red wine. We did not eat in the hotel, there are always plenty of choices nearby and we particularly liked the diner about a block away for breakfast on the way towards Times Square. Overall though a very enjoyable stay for my birthday, more I think to do with the city than the hotel.

I recently stayed again early this month, and I while I would ay the staff and the overall experience is still top notch, the hotel is in the midst of a renovation and I am not keen on the shift. The colors seem decidedly dark, the furniture more modern rather than traditional, and gone are the apricot colored coverlets. Instead, just the standard white down that every hotel has. Frankly, it reminds me a lot of the Empire which another hotel I stay in a lot in NYC. I am not crazy about it. I liked the luxury and the lightness of the old decor. And since the rooms are conventionally NYC tiny, dark furniture and carpeting really makes them smaller. Still, I understand that after many years renovations must be done. And I understand that the new rooms have more electrical outlets. Mine certainly had plenty and that was a plus. One negative was no coffee in the room and the free coffee in the lobby (a plus!) didn't start until 7am. Too late for an early riser like me and I HATE having to get dressed to go out and get coffee. And all the rooms I've ever had are pretty small. On the plus side, the staff could not have been more helpful and attentive. the minibar was not stocked when I first arrived and the management corrected this the next day. On my arrival I received a plate of chocolate covered strawberries and a ""welcome back"" note. That was spectacular! I was surprised that the hotel staff remembered I had stayed there in the past. But they did. Every time I exited there was someone to hail a cab or help with luggage or offer an umbrella. The coffee and water in the lobby was a wonderful plus and that little library was a wonderful haven! It is a great place to relax. The bed was comfortable. Wonderful that I got a NY Times delivered daily! A huge plus for me. Housekeeping was always prompt and perfect. I never had that experience of coming back at 3pm and finding my room not done. Another plus is great fluffy bathrobes!! This is one of my number one requirements! Love that. This is a small, boutique hotel find. WONDERFUL location. Right near Saks 5th Ave., St. Patrick's Rockefeller Center, theaters, Times Square (but away from the noise). It is really an ideal location. And perhaps because there is so much competition in NYC, the Iroquois really does try harder with its service. I would say the service is 5 star. amenities and room more like 3 1/2 to 4 star. But maybe when renovations are complete it will be more like 5. Coffee in the room, please!","Tulsa, Oklahoma","tamarap3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tulsa, Oklahoma</strong>",3,4.0

The beds were comfortable, the pillows nice and plentiful, there was an MP-3 deck/stereo, and the room was less noisy than most as it was overlooking a courtyard. My only gripe was that I couldn't get the room as cool as I like it (not really that big of a deal since it was mild out and I tend to like a meat locker temp).

We have definitely found our New York base for upcoming visits to the city . This charming boutique hotel ,perfectly located half a block from Fifth Avenue and just minutes from the Theatre District , is run like clockwork . Small Luxury Hotels Of The World can be justly proud of maintaining this property within their very select group. The ever-present , ""hands on "" General Manager , Breandan Gallagher can boast a staff that, without exception , have been hand-picked or perfectly trained. They understand that a smile , combined with informed guidance , create the ideal atmosphere with which to commence each day . We certainly learned and laughed a lot !At 'Front of House' , Amanda , Anna , Kelly , Christoph and Billy worked together as a well-run team , along with others whose names we fail to recall . Seth , Liriam ,and JJ were positioned on the other side of Reception to ensure that our needs were met , and that we were starting off in the right direction. At the Concierge desk , Vanessa and Bill made sure that reservation requirements were met , and that we knew how to reach our destination . All of these people , plus others , represented the team on hand to satisfy your daily needs. There were undoubtedly numerous equally skilled people behind the scenes , who contributed to the running of this ""jewel"" which is unpretentious, but which carries the correct level of sophistication.Whilst we were there , the hotel was undergoing a complete renovation. This could cause disruption , but not once during the week were we disturbed. We enjoyed the luxury of an Executive Suite on the twelfth floor . Apparently we were the first to utilize this accommodation following its total overhaul . The comfort factor was complete, but to us , the total lack of noise was the most important aspect. The new insulation eliminated any noise from adjacent rooms , and one would never realise that West 44th Street was directly in front of us. In this beautifully decorated suite we had just one complaint. The only mirror, located in the bathroom , was not long enough to reassure us that we looked good enough from top to bottom , in order to compete with the rest of Manhattan !! This was mentioned to Seth on our first morning. By the time we returned , a full-length mirror had been placed in the living room.We ate breakfast at the hotel each day. The delightful Samantha was there to seat us each morning , and showed genuine interest in our daily plans and activities . Manus and Pinto ensured that our requirements , and occasionally fussy needs , were fully satisfied at table. Again , they were all fully aware of the value of a smile.We apologise to those people whom we have failed to mention , but stress again that we never experienced anything but genuine courtesy from all of the staff. We thank all of these people for their positive contribution to our vacation , and strongly suggest that readers of this review can book with confidence at The Iroquois when next visiting New York . We cannot wait to return .Thank you all , Ron and Peter , Port Hope , Ontario , Canada .","Port Hope, Canada","TRAVELHAPPY022</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port Hope, Canada</strong>",36,5.0

It's quite an old fashioned hotel which adds to the charm and small enough that the staff quickly get to know you and cheerily greet you at every opportunity by name. James Dean was a regular guest once upon a time and you certainly get a sense that this is a place with a history.Our Premium King room was spacious and well appointed although the elderly lifts were a little temperamental during our stay and we occasionally had to use the stairs (which was interesting being on the 8th floor)! Location wise, W44th is about a central as you can get, in the middle of everything but just far enough away from the craziness of Time Square.We are SLH members and were pretty well looked after as usual. No upgrade this time but a nice bottle of wine and some chocolates in the room on arrival as well as a late check-out on the day we left. The high speed Wifi was complimentary as was a decent breakfast every morning. We never ate at the restaurant with so many options elsewhere but did finish the night in Lantern's Keep on a few occasions and enjoyed some very imaginative cocktails and - I'm not kidding - admired the nicest ice I've ever seen in a drink anywhere.

We were so looking forward to our stay at the Iroquois as we had done our homework on the internet as well as visiting the hotel several months before to check it out. An old elegant hotel in the middle of a refurbishment and in a great location. We were greeted by warm and friendly reception staff. Feel compelled to mention the staff in the restaurant bar, the concierge and doormen. They were all exceptionally friendly, efficient and a joy to deal with. With beautiful bathrooms the rooms were well appointed but didn't feel clean enough to walk around without slippers - an acid test of any hotel for us. Had some major issues which the front of house manager eventually sorted out and made a reasonable adjustment to our bill. I do not feel as if it is fair to state what the issues were since some recompense was made. However another big disappointment was a broken promise made by the front of house manager. Several months before we had been promised a continental breakfast for our stay but this offer was withdrawn when we checked in. This was very disappointing and a real let down in terms of trust and respect for the establishment. It also embarrassed us with our friends as we had organised the hotel stay for them too. We were shocked at this approach to customer service by an establishment in the SLH group. So for this very very shoddy approach we would not want to stay there again.

We booked the suite, as we needed the extra space for the 4 of us. The rooms in this hotel are not large, but we knew that going in and space was not a huge issue. As expected the rooms were very classy and clean. The bed was large and comfortable (although my mother in law did not love the pullout couch). Turn down and maid service was always reliable as was the WiFi connection. The staff here are really top notch. There is always a doorman to greet you upon entering the hotel, and the front desk staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. The library room with coffee in the morning and infused fruit water the rest of the day is a great perk. Location is fantastic if you want to be close to the main touristy action of Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue shopping, The Empire State Building, etc. However you are tucked away from the action enough to avoid most of the noise and crowds. Highly recommended Bryant Park is just around the corner and is a great green ""oasis"" in the busy city.

It also had much better ambiance than chain hotels. My three suggestions for improvement would be:1. Provide complimentary water. If your room rate is US$250 per night, don't charge your guests $9 for a bottle of Fiji water in the room, especially since the hotel is a bit old and the tap water probably not healthy to drink. 2. There is an excellent diner next door with a 4-star TripAdvisor rating. Suggest you price your hotel's breakfast accordingly, or better still include it in your room rate. I had a great breakfast next door at the diner for $10. 3. The shower is a bit of a trickle. Would have been nicer to have been able to shower with a better water flow.

I stayed at the Iroquois Hotel in June 2016 for 4 nights. I booked it through their own website during a promotional anniversary sale. The hotel is not too far from Grand Central Station where I got a shuttle bus to and from JFK. Check in was quick and easy. I had requested a quite room on a high floor and that is what I got. I thought the room would be smaller than it was but I had plenty of room to walk around & there was sufficient storage. Room was spotlessly clean with turndown service each night with a chocolate left on my pillow. The bed was very comfortable. I could hear very little street noise in the room and therefore slept well each night. The bathroom was a decent size also. Molton Brown toiletries were supplied which I just love anyway. I didn't eat breakfast in the hotel but there was a diner a few doors down from the hotel which was good. Complimentary tea and coffee were served in the hotel lobby every morning. This hotel is in a great location in midtown on W44th St. between 5th Ave & 6th Ave. I was going to see a play in the Belasco Theatre which was a block away also on W44th St. so it was very convenient. Near subway at Grand Central & Times Sq. I love New York. It's a great place to visit. This hotel was great.

We liked the hotel, it's location and service. Unfortunately, this time it was NOT a four star experience.This time on arrival, we noted that our room was far too hot. We lowered the thermostat to 60F and opened the bathroom window, then went out to visit NYC. On our return, we noted no change in the temperature and had to call for assistance in order to open the 2nd window in the bedroom. No relief. It remained too hot to sleep well ALL night.FAR more bothersome was the mechanical device that was frequently rattling and banging in the wall directly beside the bed at 20 minute intervals ALL night long! The combination of both these things meant little rest for both of us on our first night in NYC. The next morning, Kelli, Director of Front Office at the hotel, immediately expressed concern when we related our issues and upgraded our room at no charge, arranging for our belongings to be moved while we attended our convention. Our new room was a definite improvement, with two exceptions:1) the bathroom while gorgeous,had no thermostat and with NO windows open was FREEZING 2) there was no hot water on our final morning, which necessitated a change in our plans for our final morning. Eventually, hot water was finally restored. As we checked out, another discussion with Kelli about our latest issues, lead to the cost of one night's stay being deducted from our bill. That was fair and done proactively by Kelli.While we remain disappointed with our experience, we were most appreciative of Kelli's proactive efforts, professional and empathetic attitude and her personal involvement to redress the situation. She also escalated our concerns to the General Manager, who did contact my husband via email twice to apologize. We have been travelling to NYC for almost 30 years, and we have never chosen to stay at ANY hotel four times. We love this section of 44th St. and have stayed in 4 other hotels on 44th.

Our meeting point was Penn Station as my friend took the train up from the DC Area and I flew into LaGuardia and took the train into the city. We both had carry-on bags and it was an easy 10 block walk to the hotel. Of course, the only challenge was navigating through the heavy Christmastime crowds but that's to be expected during this time of year. Check-in/Check-out: The staff from the doorman to the front desk were professional, courteous, attentive, and friendly. They greeted us immediately and check-in was fast and efficient. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready yet so the doorman checked our bags and we were able to grab a libation and bite to eat in the hotel's restaurant. As promised, our room was ready after we were done with our meal. Our early checkout was fast and painless. Again, staff was professional, friendly, and peppy, even at 6:00am in the morning! Doorman was there to help us with luggage and a taxi but we ended up walking back to Penn Station, too. Room: We stayed in a room with 2 double beds on the 9th floor. It was cozy and clean with enough space to move around. Beds were firm and comfortable. Bathroom was clean and loved the toiletry selection. The room didn't face the street but you could still hear the outside noise at night. We never heard other guests on our floor. It was nice to get turndown service at night with the chocolates. My only complaint was the lack of an in-room coffeemaker. I'm an early riser and the coffee service in the lobby downstairs didn't start until 7am which was definitely too late for me on Monday morning when I had to be at the train station before 7am to catch the train back to the airport. What I liked best: Location: You can't beat the location. It's half a block away from 5th Ave and a short walk to all the mid-town sites and conveniences: Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Center, NYC Public Library, Bryant Park, mid-town dept. stores, convenience stores, ATM (corner of 5th), small local eats, subway station, etc. Staff Customer Service: The front staff and doormen were always professional, courteous, friendly, attentive. They always greeted us when we were either leaving or coming back to the hotel. They also have a great knowledge of the area restaurants and bars. On Friday night, the hotel's bar was still busy so the doormen suggested the bar across the street which turned out to be an excellent choice-great vibe and atmosphere and it had a fireplace, too! Perfect to sit by on a cold night. On Sunday night, we had planned to eat at the hotel's restaurant for dinner but it was closed so the front desk staff suggested the restaurant next door which also turned out to be an excellent choice-it wasn't crowded at all and the food and service were excellent. I definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in the heart of mid-town Manhattan. You can't go wrong with the Iroquois Hotel.

Staff is lovely, gracious, professional and welcoming. Special thanks to Anna and Amanda for making our visit extra special. They were so nice and helpful when we arrived after Delta rerouted our luggage. They immediately gave us toiletries to get us through the night, complimentary drinks at the bar and delivered chocolate strawberries to our room. Nice touch ladies and greatly appreciated.

They are my favorite! The elevators were pretty slow and there were only 2 of them on the floor. The best part is the hotel was 2 blocks from Time Square where the play was. My fiance and I walked straight to the play and it was great when there was a huge crowd trying to leave.

On average, we stay in the City three to five nights per month for work,and leisure. This trip was booked late the week before and the hotel that where we typically stay was booked solid with several holiday events, so, I chose the Iroquois. We welcome a chance to try a new place, so I tried to select a room with a couple of upgrades vs the lowest level. The deluxe king is advertised as 300-325 square feet, so I was a bit surprised to be given a 15'x12' room on the second floor at the back of the building; must be a ""rentable"" vs ""useable"" area calculation there. The room itself was very clean and the bed was quite comfortable and with the exception of the creaking metal door in the service alley one floor below, the room was as quiet as a cave..and the level of outdoor light was similar. The bathroom was also very clean and at around 5x7, your belongings won't get scattered about. The three stars are based upon a room cost that is more typically around $225-250 per night. If $450 were the average, I would lower that rating to two stars. The location is very good and staff at the desk and throughout the facility were always courteous and helpful. So, an extra star for that.","New York City, New York","GoneOutNow</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",22,3.0

For us, it meant a quiet night's sleep, as all street noise was inaudible. Some of the furniture in the room was starting to look a little tired, but this did not detract from our experience whatsoever. Molten Brown bath products were another nice touch.

The location is perfect – just two blocks from Times Square and approximately 20 minutes’ walk from Central Park.We booked a superior room with a queen bed. We were given a room on the 12th floor and it was a decent size. Our room was also spotlessly clean with a lovely bathroom with a shower over the bath. We were also pleased to find that the bathtub had a full length shower screen rather than a shower curtain (I personally dislike shower curtains in hotels). A nice little touch was the free newspaper that we found hanging on our doorknob each morning when we got up. There was a large safe inside the closet – plenty big enough to house a laptop if needed. Our only minor gripe was that the closet didn’t have a light which meant that we had to rummage around in our suitcase in the dark. We opted not to eat breakfast in the hotel. There are plenty of restaurant choices for breakfast a few minutes’ walk away. There is a small library just off reception with complementary coffee during the morning and hot cider during the afternoon. There are also two PCs and a printer available for guest use in the library so we were able to print out our boarding passes for our return flight. We found all of the staff to be friendly and accommodating. A special mention must go to one of the doormen (sorry, but we didn’t get his name). After a taxi that we had booked to take us to the airport let us down during an extremely busy Friday evening rush hour, the hotel doorman ran up and down the street flagging yellow cabs until he found one that would take us to the airport. After initially beginning to panic, thanks to this young man, we were finally on our way. The Iroquois Hotel was perfect from start to finish.

Mind you, I visit the city 4-5 times a year so I have tried MANY hotels and consider myself to be very easy to please. Upon arriving, the staff was very helpful; they opened the doors for us, took our luggage, and were very warm and polite. However, every time we entered the hotel after that, we did not receive the same A+ treatment. I felt as if they treat you amazingly well at the time of check-in but then say ""screw it"" afterwards.When we entered our ""double bed room"" we were SHOCKED by how tiny and musty it was. I won't dock points from them because of the size because come on, you're in Midtown... you can't expect a huge room if you're paying around $300 a night (ridiculous, but true). But come on, there was barely any light at all and it was SUPER warm in the room. We adjusted the A/C but it didn't seem to work. We spoke to one of the staff and he adjusted the thermostat in our room (the same thing we did) and he said it would definitely work now- 45 minutes later, still sweating. So, I went downstairs and spoke to someone else. It was then that the lady up front explained to me that the air conditioning is controlled DOWN STAIRS and that the customers cannot adjust their own room temperature- WHAT THE HECK?!! I know people who freeze at 75 degrees and others who like their room at 60 degrees- leave it to the customer to decide if they want to freeze or burn, lol. She said she would adjust it... 1 hour later... still sweating. While we waited for the a/c to kick in, I checked the hotel rates online and noticed that although they were charging me $341 a night, the rate online was $297.. I was LIVID. You're going to overcharge me for a crappy room with no light fixtures, no a/c, and a tiny bathroom? No way. That's when I went downstairs and spoke to the manager and requested that I be charged the FAIR and POSTED daily rate.. I also requested we be moved to a room with a working a/c (they refused to admit that the air conditioner in our room was faulty). After speaking up, our rate was reduced and we were moved to a more modern room which allowed us to control the a/c temperature.I shouldn't have to pull teeth to get BASIC amenities. I think the hotel is gorgeous on the outside but I am very, very, very disappointed with the interior and the amenities. Spend less money on making the lobby look ridiculously high-class, and allot that money to improving the rooms.On a small positive note, the cleaning staff was very sweet, they left chocolates in our room every day, and you really can't beat the location (1-2 blocks from times square).

We were looking for a good central location for exploring the city and seeing a show. The Iroquois fit the bill. The hotel was surprisingly quiet given its central location. Noise was not an issue at all. I had read other reviews that called this hotel a ""port in the storm"" and I feel that's a very accurate description. After long days of touring, trekking through the streets and hot subway stations, this was a very welcome place to return in the afternoon and unwind before dinner, drinks, shows and nightlife. The beds were very comfortable and we slept exceptionally well.The staff at the Iroquois really set it apart, though. We arrived very early and they were quick to assist with secure storage of our luggage, ready to make suggestions through concierge, and provided a place to freshen up before heading out for the day. They were able to accommodate our check out needs as well, which was greatly appreciated. They were quick to arrange transportation and were super approachable and helpful throughout our stay. We'd probably skip the breakfast package next time, but definitely did appreciate the coffee in the morning.The bar was a comfortable and convenient place for a drink.We had considered some larger hotels in the theatre district, but this was definitely more personal and more our speed.

Room - large living room with comfy sofas and large TV, nice big bedroom to spread our stuff out in again, a large TV. The bathroom was probably a compromise for such large living spaces but for us average Brits, we had no problem ;-) My ONLY grip is that I wanted a cup of tea as soon as I wake up and as no facilities in the room I was unable to do this. Guys, a kettle or something in the room wouldn't go a miss. I was tempted in making a point of this and wondering down to the lobby in just my underwear to make myself a good old cuppa..... But then thought better of it. It was irritating having to get dressed and thus my wife had to put up with Mr grumpy pants each morning :-) That said, if the only thing I can moan about was not being able to make a cup of tea in my room then we are still on a winner.

Yes location is great and the staff are helpful but the floor we stayed on (11th) smelt musty as soon as we stepped out of the lift. Our original room was small, dusty and we couldn't fit all 3 suitcases in the closet (as it was tiny) but would have done us. Unfortunately on our return from our first nfl game and first night in new york the discovery of a blood trail down the sink made for an uncomfortable sleep when added to the general state of the room...the hotel was fully booked and as it was late (11.30pm) they couldn't move us. They did however send someone up to clean it...albeit asking if we knew how it happened!!! (Not impressed with that!) The hotel did move us to a one bedroom suite but again the cleanliness standard was low. The double sofa bed for our teenager had a stained mattress and was incrddibly dusty when pulled out. The experience from the first room just heightened our look out! The bathroom was larger and had a spa jet...BUT when our daughter used it black bits came out of the jets presume it hadn't been used in a while.

The Iroquois New York provided the best customer service experience I have ever received at a hotel. The entire team were extremely professional, attentive, knowledgeable and friendly throughout our stay. The hotel is perfectly located. Although The Iroquois is situated right in the heart of Midtown (2 blocks from Times Square), West 44th Street between 5th & 6th Aves is quiet, clean, historical and safe. Important nearby amenities include: the Red Flame Diner a few doors down (highly recommended for breakfast), a Duane Reade convenience store / pharmacy at the end of the block, drop-off laundry across the street and several main subway stations a short walk away. The Iroquois hotel boasts free tea/coffee in the library, excellent free WiFi, a complimentary DVD library (great selection!), a complimentary newspaper delivered to your door each morning (NY Times) and daily free Walking Tours. The adjoining hotel bar is a relaxing place to unwind with daily 'drinks offers', including a good selection of premium bottled beers, wines, spirits and cocktails. Stop by for a chat with bartender Thomas if you get a chance. We all felt that the entire hotel staff went above & beyond to ensure that we had a great stay, a memorable wedding experience and made things very easy for us, especially caring for our 6-month-old baby boy during his first big trip. Even the General Manager Breandan Gallagher made himself known to me and took the time to congratulate me on my wedding day. For the attention of the management, the following members of staff should be commended for their professionalism and kindness throughout our stay: Amanda on the Front Desk, Vanessa and Bill on the Concierge Desk, Seth and Lirim the Bell Staff, and Thomas the bartender. I would especially like to highlight the fact that Seth totally enhanced our experience from start to finish.

With it's centrally controlled air conditioning that is either too cold or not cold enough, its old slow elevators, its mostly cramped and outdated rooms that are noisy on the street side and quiet but dark and dingy at the back of the building, it's complete lack of in-room coffee making facilities or ice availability (you have to order ice from the front desk)...etc.I have to point out that the service cannot be faulted however that should be the norm for a four star hotel.

We had a suite on the top floor (12th) facing West 44th Street, with our children sleeping on a fold out bed in the sitting room.Check in was at 3pm. We turned up at 2.30pm and were told that the room wasn't ready as house-keeping had to check it. However, at 3pm on the dot, we were allowed up to the room, so I'm not sure whether we were just being made to wait until the allotted time.The room, and sitting room, were both of a good size (for NYC) and the bed in the bedroom was large and comfortable. The sofa bed was also a good size. The bathroom was fairly small, with a 60cm x 60cm shower cubicle and separate bath (which was not full size), but was fine. Like the rest of the room, it was clean.There was free wifi in the room.We didn't eat in the hotel's restaurant. For breakfast, we went locally to Pershing Square (just by Grand Central Station) and the Brooklyn Diner (just by Times Square), both of which we would recommend. (There is also a diner on West 44th Street called The Red Flame, which I have eaten at previously and is perfectly fine.) For dinners, we went to the West Village - The Spotted Pig, Spice Market and Cafe Cluny. I would recommend all of them, though be careful not to order too much food at the Spice Market. Also, you cannot book at the Spotted Pig and have to put your name down on their list (in person).While we liked the hotel, if we were to go again, we would probably stay in the West Village, which is a bit quieter and more 'boutique-y'.","London, United Kingdom","Londontripadviser</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",115,4.0

Rooms are the usual New York City small, yet a strategic bay window, room mirrors and spacious and well-appointed bathroom give the small room depth. Queen beds are really doubles -- so get prepared or ask are there any king-sized beds in the hotel. My search online yielded none, but call. Calling, also, yields the best rates -- better than any online consolidator. HOW'S THE FOOD?The hotel has a famous bar with resident mixologists serving up specialty cocktails and a place in the history books. The bar is part private club-ish, and part bar for the urban sophisticate. There are no hipsters in sight.Room service is very costly -- even moreso than usual. - Tip 1, order room service breakfast in bed for one and you can most definitely feed two. After two heaping plates with at least six pieces of bacon a piece for my partner and I arrived, I then understood why the attendant asked twice if I meant to order two breakfasts!- Tip 2, there's an American diner about five businesses down boasting its TripAdvisor certificates of excellence where many guests on the block of refined hotels savored the fare and saved their funds for other delights of New York.ATTENDANTSEach person encountered is genuine and hospitable. Expect elevators to be held and greetings for a great day and pleasantries upon return. You will not have to wrangle luggage. Eagle-eyed attendants quickly determine if stowage is needed or a cab -- with luggage taken off your hands for whichever transaction quickly and with ease. Upon reaching your room, expect tips on room devices and inquiries of whether additional assistance is needed in shows, reservations or directions.COZINESSThe hotel has a comfortable library with books, fresh fruit-flavored water, hot water and tea choices, computers and newspapers. This area is easily accessible through French doord right off the reception area and towards the entrance/exit door. The decor includes dark wood floors, large-paneled wood walls, room-sized rugs, lamps and the warmth of a den. The reception area is kept replenished with perfectly ripe and sweet strawberries, good for grabbing on the way in or out. The entryway and library are inviting, spacious as well as cozy. SUMIf you seek a nicer place to relax while in the busy hub that is NYC and near Times Square and Broadway theaters, you have found your quiet NY home without having to go to the Upper East Side. The hotel is best suited for couples, solo travelers and perhaps those with business near the area. Rooms and ambiance seem more suited to the adult traveler moreso than the family fun outing. The Iroquois is the sort of place where once discovered, you are bound to try it again.

The drawbacks here are that there are no great views and there are no ice machines so you must always call down for ice to be sent up - and with no mini-fridges it makes it challenging to keep drinks cold in the room.Overall it's a pretty good spot that I would consider again in the future.FYI - there is a parking lot across the street with a decent rate ($45/nt).",Toronto,"Jshifrin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",17,4.0

The reason I picked this hotel was because I'd read the reviews that had mentioned how helpful the staff were, how welcoming there were and how it was a little more intimate than some of the larger hotels. As I was travelling alone with children I felt this would be the ideal hotel and I wasn't wrong!! When we arrived after a long journey, there were no mad queues or bustling to find where you were going, we just went straight in, got a lovely friendly warm reception and Seth took our bags, showed us our room and gave us loads of tips and helpful information without overwhelming us, brilliant! Now don't get me wrong, the room was a little small and there are no tea/coffee facilities in your room but you do have free tea and coffee in the lounge in the morning before you head off out if you wish. However, another fantastic thing about this hotel is the location! Turn right and in less than a 2 minute walk and you're in Times Square and turn left and in a minute you're on 5th Avenue and 5 minutes off the Empire State Building! Top location!!! I wish I'd understood the location before I came to New York because i have to be honest and say that we booked a hotel directly in Times Square for our last night (I hadn't realised how close we were!) and when we got to the other hotel the hustle, bustle, queues and 15 lifts and the impersonal nature of a large hotel made me want to run screaming back to the personal touch of The Iroquois! Plus I could hear every beeping taxi driver and police siren and I can normally sleep through anything! I'd just got used to the quiet of the Iroquois!

Although I was several hours too early for my guaranteed check-in time, the front desk staff offered me an opportunity to shower and change in the workout facility on the third floor which is a converted bedroom with a small bathroom off the gym area. It was a bit awkward to bring a small roller suitcase into the bathroom while other guests worked out, but I was so grateful for an option to shower and refresh knowing I would be gone the entire day and likely late into the evening. Additionally, there was coffee and mint-infused water in the lobby that was much appreciated to help adjust from the overnight flight. Arriving back at the hotel around 11 pm, I was pleasantly surprised to have a room on the twelfth floor with windows looking directly at the Chrysler Bldg...a special landmark I never tire of seeing even after years of having an office directly across the street. The bathroom had a full shower over a tub, a large pedestal sink and a sizable window ledge to store make-up/toiletries. This was also a pleasant surprise since I've been in several New York hotels that have much larger lobby and bar space, but the bedrooms and bathrooms are out of scale to the rest of the pubic spaces. This room had a nice-sized closet with door, a desk with great light and view during the day, and comfy bed with really nice linens. The staff were all pleasant without being solicitous. There was a glitch with the guest computer on the day I was leaving, but the front desk staff helped out with computer needs while the server was being fixed. This hotel has a distinct old-world feel, indeed it's a historical building on a centrally located street in Midtown. Because it's 44th street, it's not as busy a thoroughfare as 42nd or virtually any other crosstown street because Grand Central blocks the cross-town traffic, so the street has a quieter vibe. The Iroquois shares the same block at the Algonquin, Royalton and Sofitel hotels, and the Harvard Club of NYC. Two blocks from Bryant Park and NY Public Library and three from Grand Central Station which is a destination in and of itself and certainly the most universal launching point for all subways and trains to upstate NY and beyond.

The present for our daughter never materialised either(!) so why offer ?!The rooms were large and the beds were so comfortable but the rooms were very dark and very cluttered with items they wanted you to purchase.

The concierge not so - he never introduced himself to us and was usually sat talking to the same lady (with a dog) every time we walked past.On returning to the hotel every afternoon we telephoned down for some hot water and cups (we had to purchase milk and tea bags) and this was duly brought up ....but we got charged for 2 out of the 5 times (disappointing).We didn't use the restaurant and only used the front bar on 1 evening - which was pleasant but had no atmosphere.The location is superb - everything a 10-20 minute walk away or subway stops nearby and taxis stopping outside the hotel. If the ground floor was configured more for guests and not drinkers/diners it would be much better as an open plan layout, with lots of sofas and informal sitting areas. The restaurant was large but we never saw more than 2-4 tables used, the back bar was small, dark and very loud.

You can imagine our disappointment. That said, the hotel did everything they reasonably could to make amends. They booked us into their sister hotel, arranging transport of our luggage both there and back. On return to the Iroquois they upgraded us to better rooms at no extra cost and they arranged for each couple to have a refund of one night's accommodation. All in all, they couldn't have done much more, given the initial problem (we never found out what it was).The hotel is a historic hotel on West 44th Street, a few doors along from The Algonquin (of literary fame). It's very handy for all the tourist must-sees - Times Square, Empire State, Rockefeller Centre. We walked to most places including the High-line Path (although I have the blisters to prove it!)

The location is perfect. 5mins from Times Square and by 6th Avenue so you can walk to the Empire State Building, Library, Rockefeller Centre and all the way up to Central Park (I recommend walking, there's some great places to grab food on the way). A couple of doors down is the Red Flame Diner. Brilliant tasty food at a reasonable price, ideal spot for breakfast.The hotel itself is lovely and I cannot fault the staff at all. The doorman always greeted us with a smile and the reception staff and concierge went out of their way whenever we needed help or advice. We had a twin room which had 2 double beds and an en suite bathroom. It was a lot bigger than we were expecting and had a dual sided storage cupboard/wardrobe which was great for stashing our clothes, suitcases and shopping. Beds were incredibly comfortable and black out curtains were very welcome. Room was always completely spotless too, I never found a single speck of dust.The bathroom wasn't huge or super modern but I loved it. There were brass taps and marble-like sink. It was the perfect size and there was always a great supply of fluffy towels and robes. I also didn't notice any issue with the shower pressure which I was expecting.The only downside to our room was the lack of a main overhead light. When we had all the lamps on and it was daylight outside the room was bright enough (lighting in the bathroom was much better) however it did mean the room could be quite dim. As we were only ever there at night and first thing in the morning this didn't bother us but it's something to bare in mind.Lantern's Keep is the cocktail bar in this hotel and it is incredible! Drinks average about $16 each but they're worth it for some prohibition era cocktails. This is not the place to come if you want a cosmopolitan or Long Island iced tea. It is however great if you want to try something new. It's small and intimate with a great atmosphere and very knowledgeable bar staff. We didn't try the restaurant so I can't comment on it other than to say the breakfast smelt amazing.The hotel provide free coffee in the lobby and whilst we were there we also had free spiced apple cider which was lovely. There is a small library area with access to computers and there internet as well as a live flight information screen which allows you to check your flight details and check in without using the regular computers.We asked the hotel to arrange a car to take us to the airport when we were leaving and a huge suburban turned up! We were able to charge this to the room account and it saved dealing with taxis. I would say though we had to be at JFK for 7.30pm and booked the car for 5.30pm (an hour earlier than the hotel suggested) and we got there at 7.45pm due to the traffic. Take this into account when booking but this is otherwise a great service.I would suggest this hotel for anyone who doesn't want to stay in a carbon copy modern chain hotel but still wants to be in the heart of Midtown.","Manchester, United Kingdom","Sophie R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",17,5.0

However, we did have an initial issue with our room and politely asked the next morning if anything could be done. The response was somewhat predictable 'we will look into it'. So of we went to catch up on the day's NY sights . When we got back my expectations were not high and expected a response along the lines, 'sorry, there is nothing we can do'. But to our very pleasant surprise they put us in another room and shifted all our belongings while we were out. Full marks to the staff for handling the issue so well. They listened and responded. I have read other comments that the rooms are small. Well, we found our room (deluxe queen) very comfortable and roomy enough to cater for our needs.The location is superb - so central you can walk anywhere. We walked to the MET, MOMA, all the iconic buildings, Central Park and even to the 9/11 memorial.Couple of tips for those who like good restaurants and decent coffee. 44th Street has four superb restaurants the Strip House (pricey but the best steak ever eaten), the Triomphe (part of the Iriquois - has fine dining), Killani provides great greek and mediterranean cuisine, The Modern has great French food. By the way there is also a typical NY diner at the corner if you want some good basic food. Right across the Hotel is Gregory's - they serve great coffee and fresh muffins etc.We will finish off by singling out the staff at reception, concierge, doormen and cleaners - they always acknowledged you and had a smile.Based on our experience, highly recommend the Iriquois.",Adelaide,"AdelaideElma</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide</strong>",2,5.0

I had emailed this information ahead and it was good they recognised this by giving us a bottle of wine and chocolates. Our first room was ok, small by usual standards but we were so tired from our trip from UK that we accepted it. This room 410 was on a high floor (4) as we had requested however the noise at night from the air conditioning or something else was just too much. So we asked to be moved and told the front desk, the man said he would pass this onto the day manager as we were up really early on our first day. We had breakfast at Red Flame came back and saw the day manager and confirmed all of this. We went out and returned about 4:00 pm to check our new room only to be told that all rooms had now been allocated and we would have to remain in 410. After a lot of complaining - no one told us we needed to be back at a certain time to secure a change of room, they eventually and somewhat begrudgingly moved us to a better upgraded room. This was better thank you. The front desk attitude did let this hotel down, fine when you check in but somewhat frosty if there's a problem.As far as sights to see this is a great location, ask the concierge for advice -Alex was great, she even helped out with medical advice. We used Red Flame for breakfast and some evening meals, it's only half a block on the same streets towards 6th Avenue.

The guest room was compact - normal for Manhattan -- but sufficient and all the room amenities were top drawer. The fitness center is smallish but adequate for both a full aerobic and weight workout.

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, especially concierges Bill and Vanessa. Vanessa took the time to teach us the subway system, and Bill was full of great advice on activities, unique locations to visit, and even coordinated us with his restaurant connections. I know those are normal concierge expectations, but their sincere interest in our first time NYC visit was exceptionally genuine and personal.Prior to the trip, I invested at least 8 hours in reading hotel reviews and researching our options. With “normal” priorities: safety, cleanliness, friendly staff, location, sleeping conditions, price, atmosphere/vibe, (basically in that order), we determined that although most hotels in NYC are expensive (compared to our Midwest U.S. upbringing), it was worth paying a bit more to stay at the Iroquois. We were absolutely correct! We have nothing but good things to say about everything we hoped for and received from the Iroquois. Perhaps it was due to our extended stay, but we even enjoyed our conversations with the bellhops: JJ, Carlos, and Marick. We were fortunate/unfortunate in being snowed out of returning to our home state, and the front desk staff were extremely accommodating in coordinating an additional night for us at the most discounted nightly rate from our prior reservation.The location was convenient for walking to Times Square (2 blocks), a diner and also “Blue Bar” on the block, and the great Brooklyn Diner about 5 blocks away. Easy walking access to subway entrances, reasonable walking to the Empire State building, Bryant Park, and Rockefeller Center, a bit further to Central Park, etc. The attached French restaurant Triomphe and the Lantern’s Keep lounge were nice romantic treats. We felt central to everything that we wanted to do, which included using the subway to travel all around Manhattan (WTC, Intrepid, The Met, Cooper Hewitt museum, Javits Center, “The Friends building”, Chelsea galleries, Madison and 5th Ave shopping, The Roundabout Theater, Grand Central Station, St. John the Divine Cathedral, The View rotating restaurant, The Rum House for live music, etc). Bottom line, we easily walked about 1 mile anywhere around the hotel, and used public transportation to get to all of the tourist and business locations. There were only brief moments walking late at night when we rushed from one area of Times Sq to another, or decided to take a taxi, but overall, we felt very safe in this area.Other reviews say that the rooms were small, but we were actually happy with the size. Perhaps our expectations were low in reading people’s description of other NYC rooms. My only constructive criticism was the need for additional wall outlets or power strips. The front desk said that they would soon be replacing the desk lights with those with outlets.The free morning coffee was some of the best I have had, and if not, there is a coffee shop just across the street. Although there was no real view from the hotel windows, that feature was not a concern or high on our priority list anyway.Safe, Beautiful, Convenient, Friendly, Comfortable bed, Quiet room… We couldn’t have asked for more :) Thank you for making our NYC trip a dream come true!","Longmont, Colorado","24TimK24</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Longmont, Colorado</strong>",2,5.0

It's located only a couple of blocks away from beautiful Bryant Park and also Times Square, but on a quieter neighborhood. The closest subway is in Bryant Park, so it was very easy for us to go anywhere from Central Park to Memorial park.Everyone is very nice and helpful. It spooked my husband a little bit one the first day, he was wondering why everyone was genuinely attentive, something that we usually didn't get on other NYC hotels.The hotel offers fresh strawberries on the front desk, complimentary coffee in the morning and hot cider/iced flavored water in the afternoon. There's also complimentary walking tour that leaves from the hotel which is on every Sunday I believe for Bryant Park/Grand Central walk, but if you are interested in different neighbourhood walks, I think you can check out their sister hotels on their website. The walk runs about 1 hour, and it was a lot of fun. I've been to Bryant Park and Grand Central many times, but it was good to see them in different perspectives.The hotel room is average size for NYC, but very clean and the bathroom is beautiful. The bed was fairly comfortable. The view was not good, or should I say no view at all? But all I did is just closed the blinder and problem solved! Especially when the room comes with a complimentary red wine, who cares about the view? :) We spent most of our time outside the hotel anyway. But if you care about a view, maybe just ask for the ones that are facing the 44th st. My fave thing to do in this hotel after a long day is to pop-in into their Finnish sauna within the gym that is open 24-hour. You just need to give the front desk a heads up 15 minutes prior so it will be ready for you.

With the Red Flame Diner a couple doors down, a parking garage right across the street, a pharmacy/convenience store at the end of the block on 5th Ave., and Times Square a short walk, it can't be beat. I find the Iroquois a better overall value vs the Sofitel. The room, Premium King, was clean, comfortable and quiet. It was small, but it was configured in a way that did not seem small. It was well laid out with a good size closet and plenty of drawers for clothing. The bathroom was very well done. Spacious, clean, plenty of room. A couple quirky items of note: Only 1 elevator was working during our stay. It really was only a slight inconvenience during normal peak periods like checkout or dinner time. It was unusually hot during the stay and the A/C seemed to struggle a bit to keep the room cool. The speaker on the TV kept cutting out. The room was cool enough and I was able to ""fix"" the TV on my own, so no real issues. Overall a great stay. I would recommend the hotel and I will definitely consider coming here again.","Boston, Massachusetts","MATravelerBOS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",78,3.0

More good vibes! We had a quiet room with a comfortable queen bed. It was updated and well-maintained. The bathroom was nicely appointed, clean, and stocked with Molton Brown bathroom products. As with most of the older NYC hotels, the room was quite small, but we expected this. We appreciated the free WiFi and turn down service with chocolates.

The bathroom had Molton Brown products and there was sufficient storage, although we had travelled light. The hotel provides complimentary tea/ coffee downstairs and all the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Surprisingly, there is no ice vending although guests are allowed to use the mini bar as a fridge. There is a nightly 'turn-down' service where you return in the evening to find your duvet turned down and two nice Belgian chocolates on your bed. The concierge service is excellent. They go out of your way to help the hotel guests. I was fortunate to receive a surprise cake delivered to me which one of my party arranged seamlessly with the concierge. The location is perfect, a short walk from Times Square, Empire State, Macy's etc. Central Park us approximately a 10-15 min walk away. There are subway stations within walking distance.

So a room higher up or/and at the back of the hotel. I got to the hotel very late due to my international delays. I had been awake almost 24 hours so it was not until I had unpacked and went to see my Mum in her bedroom that I noticed my room was not on the 3rd floor and very noisy with no wardrobe. I asked to be moved and I was to the 9th floor. A lot quieter and although the room was downgraded to a queen bedroom, the room was bigger and had a wardrobe unlike the King room. My new room was very cold but the porter brought me a plug in fan Heater which helped. My bedroom would take 3-4 hours to warm up, but my mother who was on floor 11 had no issues. Apart from the bedroom issue and the heating issue which I then knew how to get around each day (I would simply turn the heat to full when I went out for the evening so it was warm upon my return) the hotel was enjoyable. The location is superb. The staff are extremely helpful too. It's not a large hotel, but personally I like that. The rooms were tidied each day, but the turn down service is very early so if you are still in your room around 7:30pm getting ready for an evening you will miss this service. This did not bother me, but I wanted to mention it. I would return to this hotel, but book their Queen room as its a bigger room and has a wardrobe and also ask for a higher room or a room at the back and ensure to re ask when you check in as my request was not followed through. Times Square is literally a 5 minute walk, 5th Avenue even less and you are right by the New York Library. Also wait until the hotel had a sale. We booked and then the booked when by chance we saw they had a sale. If you can get your room in the sale you should definitely stay.

Excellent location, obviously: just outside of the hustle/bustle of Times Square, but near enough to walk easily to theater, shows, restaurants and subway. Two small quibbles kept it from being five star. One is that although the library is adorable and the coffee good, I really don't like padding down to the lobby to get my morning coffee. The addition of even a tiny coffee maker in the room would be a big improvement. In addition, we could not get the heat to go down -- I believe it is centrally heated.

There's something nice about the familiarity of walking into a hotel where you've stayed before and in this sense I was pleased with the hotel even though there were missteps by the staff along the way. Per my request we had a room on an upper floor facing inward so as to minimize street noise (saying courtyard is a misnomer as there is no courtyard, just other buildings to view as well as fire escapes). The room is small like most NYC hotels but comfortably furnished. The beds and linens were wonderful, as were the plush towels in the bathroom. High quality toiletry items were another nice touch. The room was super clean and our room was promptly cleaned each day. Lighting could be better in the bedroom (bathroom lighting is excellent) and for two people (I traveled with a friend), there isn't much room to unpack and store clothes. The hallways are beautifully furnished and lighted. Coffee is served each morning in the downstairs ""library"", and warm cider is available in the afternoon, which was very welcome given the cold weather we experienced while there.Taxis are not easy to find there given the number of hotels located close by and the front door staff was not at the top of its game in helping secure them. I noticed several of the doormen preferred to remain inside to escape the cold weather so we were pretty much left on our own to get a cab. I do like the location of this hotel -- 44th street is lovely and enough removed from Times Square as to not feel like you are in the midst of the frenzy. Also, the bar across the street at The Royalton boasts a lovely fireplace area and cozy seating so it was easy to find a good place to go for a drink and conversation since the lobby of The Iroquois is very small.

So here's the not so good qualities :1. The restaurant food was ok. Went there for breakfast ...and ordered a egg white omelette. The waiter kind of looked at me in surprise at that request and although it was cooked without any major issues, it was a bit runny. I had to ask for butter to come with the toast and received an herb infused butter for my toast. What happened to plain butter and jam or fruit spread of some sort? I wound up not eating most of it and just left with enough fuel to get started on my walk about the city.2. The rooms are incredibly small. I knew this prior to coming as I read a lot of the reviews on here, and it was just myself, so no big deal. If I had a traveling companion, then it would have been a less than optimal experience, practically being on top of one another. Again...just myself, so it wasn't a big deal.3. Rooms were stuffy. I had to open the windows for air flow, and the thermostat wasn't really helpful...probably because the hotel was on heat. 4. Bar area was incredibly packed! All the time. So if you're not there when it opens, forget about it. Next doors hotel had an awesome bar that I wound up going to 1 of the nights I stayed. 5. The doorman, except for the young man that was on duty when I first arrived, weren't very hospitable with the opening and closing of the doors and just the occasional greeting. Eh...again, no big deal to me personally, but if these are things one judges and overall experience on, then, well there ya go!Ok...so the positives:1. Front desk staff was very very nice. I checked in later as my flight was delayed and they welcomed with a smile...easy fast and efficient. AWESOME!2. The doorman who was on duty that night helped me with luggage and was very kind and gave me some ideas as to what to do that evening...very friendly and talkative.3. Room was very clean....it actually exceeded the norm on cleanliness for hotel rooms...seriously it was impressed.4. Room was cute and efficient. ..No frills which was ok with me, and it was quiet (4th floor by the elevator too)!5. Love love love the location of this hotel in proximity to whatever you really wanna see. 6. Heating in this hotel is not an issue and I was extremely happy about that after seeing some reviews of that being an issue at other hotels. All in all...this isn't a bad hotel to stay. Just be sure you know what you're looking for and understand what you'll be paying for. If you're traveling solo..I recommend it. It's not a party hotel ( more of an older crowd)...having a queen superior room is fine...it's a place to rest your head and weary feet!","Los Angeles, California","stellao929</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",18,4.0

I had emailed the hotel before arrival to arrange some packages to be delivered before we arrived and they stored them for me and then brought them up to our room when we asked for them. My absolute favourite memory of this hotel was being brought up to our room, opening the door, and they had the radio playing on a christmas channel. Such a nice moment to walk in to! The room itself is quite small, as per most hotels in New York, so it was a bit of a squeeze for 3 people who like to do a lot of shopping, but we managed just fine! We had two double beds which were super comfortable and I would love to have taken the pillows and duvet home with me. The room was cleaned every day and fresh towels left. There was also turn down service every night were a little card was left on the bed to inform of the weather the next day, and also some chocolates left. There was also a paper left on the back of the door every morning, although we didn't really use this. There was free coffee every morning in the lobby, and then hot apple cider in the evening, which I loved. On Thanksgiving day they had apple cider donuts (which unfortunately we missed out on) and also hot chocolate with marshmallows, as well as the hot apple cider. We literally stepped out the door on Thanksgiving day and the parade was going across the top of the street so we were able to stand there with the rest of the crowd and see the balloons go back. We stood there for an hour and the went back and watched the rest in the hotel room. The location is great. Its about a 10 minute walk at the most to Times Square if you want to go there, and there is a subway stop right around the corner that will get you everywhere else. There is also a Duane Reade at the top of the street which is 24 hour so that you can get anything else that you need. We ordered some food to the hotel one night as well which the hotel were completely fine with. The staff were so lovely and helpful with anything that we needed and there was always someone there no matter what time of the night it was.

I called this trip my sacred & profane pre-Christmas weekend (Messiah & Mormon). For a woman traveling alone, the Iroquois provided a safe, cozy basecamp for lots of happy walking to the following desitinations: Birdland on 44th on Friday night (1940's style supper club with great live jazz, cocktails & a well-lighted slightly-tipsy return on foot at 10:30 PM no hassles); Handel's Messiah at Lincoln Center on Saturday night The Book of Mormon (lmao for 90 min straight) at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on 49th - then treated myself to street vendor falafel near Times Square on the walk back on Sunday night; next day over to Rockefeller Center to see the Christmas tree and Salvation Army dance teams on my way to the Museum of Modern Art (thank God I joined MoMA online before my trip!!!!). Also on this trip: 15 minutes walk to the Hell's Kitchen Flea Market on 39th between 9th & 10th (crazy selection - I bought a slim volume of Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay, ""Self Reliance"" and a Tibetan devotional hanging). From there to Macy's on 34th/Herald Square. On my way back to The Iroquois stopped by Bryant Park skating rink & holiday festivities and bought the cutest hat at a kiosk. Walked to The Frick Collection at 70th & Central Park (still breathless at the unexpected close encounters with masterpieces and Gilt Age opulence). So happy on this trip I discovered Uncle Paul's Pizza on Madison & 46th - most delicious veggie slice and a great bottle of red to go! (a bottle of wine to go is a big deal for a Southerner). On my last day I walked to Oasis Spa on 1 Park Ave for rejuvenating Swedish massage. HIGHLY RECOMMEND: DIAL 7 car service for to- and from-airport (and cross-town) sedan service. The dispatchers can try your patience but it's worth it - the drivers are sweetly reliable, kind, and wonderfully friendly & professional. The Iroquois Hotel stands at the warm center of another totally enjoyable NYC visit. I sure had myself a time.

From the doormen to the attendants and desk staff, we really sensed that they were awaiting our arrival and were genuinely excited about it. Our room was clean, comfortable, and relaxing, especially after 20 mile hikes around the city during 100 degree weather. The place is also pretty much in the center of Manhattan, so you really can't go wrong with the location. On the last morning we were there, we decided to dine at the restaurant which adjoins the hotel, ""Triomphe."" All I can say is that I wish we had eaten there sooner because I would have made it a point to eat there every morning and I'm not even a big proponent of breakfast. Pancakes are pretty generic, but I think these were sent from pancake heaven. They were really that good. I mean, they could win awards. And I'm not even exaggerating. Back to the hotel. At times, it felt like we were some of the only people staying there, which was a plus because you seemed to lose the bustle of the city while there - sort of like a refuge. I say that, too, because, while in our room, we couldn't even tell if there were any others in the surrounding rooms. One warning though, their ""black out"" shades made us sleep almost too well! I'm continuously planning our next trip to NYC in my head and would be delighted to stay at the Iroquois again.

The amazing Vanessa is the Chief Concierge, and she is truly the heart and soul of the hotel. I was in New York for a reunion and birthday celebration with three friends from England. Vanessa helped me plan all of our theatre engagements, tours, and dinner reservations months in advance, and was involved in coordinating every aspect of our 4-day visit so that we could maximize our relatively short time together in the city. Upon arrival at the hotel, Vanessa greeted me with a warm, welcoming embrace as we had become good friends via email over the months. I didn't feel like a traveler, but a true ""guest."" In honor of our birthdays, the hotel had cards and gifts waiting for us in our rooms, and as an added treat, was kind enough to upgrade my room to an executive suite. It was awesome, and we were all so appreciative of the thoughtfulness of the staff. The hotel is conveniently situated near everything we wanted to do and see: Broadway shows, Rockettes!, 5th Avenue shopping, Rockefeller Center, city tours, fabulous restaurants. All of the hotel staff was courteous, helpful, and efficient -- even though it was often very busy in the lobby with check-ins and holiday parties in the restaurants, etc. -- we were always treated like VIPs! In addition to Vanessa, I must also mention the wonderful, Seth -- who was our go-to man for so many things: greeting us in the lobby, getting us in and out of taxis, taking our bags to the rooms, advising us on local news and events. He was a bright spot for us, and we looked forward to seeing him every day. I travel fairly frequently for work and fun, and usually always stay at the big chain hotels where I have memberships and reward programs. I'd originally planned this New York trip at one of the big Marriott hotels, and changed it to the Iroquois at the request of my British friends who'd heard good reviews about it. Who knows -- the Marriott might have been excellent....but I will surely never forget our stay at the Iroquois. It was a beautiful and memorable trip for all of us.","Arlington, Virginia","smacgreg0r</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",4,5.0

After a lot of looking we settled on the Iroquois. It had good reviews, was in a good location in midtown near to Times Square. First impressions were good, we received a warm welcome and although we couln't check in, as we arrived at 0930 AM, they stored our cases, offered us facilities to freshen up, gave us maps and directions to all local attractions, told us who would be on later when we returned and really looked after us. The receptionist was from London and sorry I can't remember her name but she was great. We returned at about 9PM and again had a good and friendly reception. Our Porter, JJ, was great. He showed us all aspects of the room, how to use the shower, the TV etc. When we booked the hotel, I had indicated that it was our 20th wedding anniversary and they had supplied chocolates, strawberries and wine so that was a really nice touch. The room itself was nice, not overly big but everything you would want. A king sized bed, which was extremely comfortable, we had no problem sleeping. Although fairly close to Times Square, there wasn't any noise. The toiletries in the bathroom were Molton Brown, which my wife informed me were of a very good quality and with nice bathrobes supplied too, she was more than happy.Our two sons had their own room, both had a double bed each.We were in NYC for 4 days, 3 nights and had a very busy schedule so we didn't really make use of the facilities there. The bar was always busy and lively and the dining room looked nice. There are also gym facilities there too. We didn't realize the history behind the hotel before we arrived but found out that James Dean had an apartment at the hotel for 2 years in the 50s.We would definitely recommend the hotel for your visit to NYC. Friendly staff, good service and good location. Nice Irish Bar just down the road called O'Donoghues too.Oh yes just one final thing, thanks to all staff for my daily morning visit to them to enquire about how to get the various attractions we were visiting that day.

The rooms are well appointed, the restaurant is quite good, and the location is great. That said, I have had several challenges with the hotel's reservation/front desk staff and after my most recent experience today, I will not be staying at the hotel again. I called the hotel this morning around 7:30 am to cancel a reservation for tomorrow (11/11) and was told that ""we don't open until 9:00 am but let me see if I can find someone to help you."" The woman put me on hold, and then the line went dead. I figured I would call back later in the day when I had more time. Around 6:30 pm I called and spoke to a reservation specialist who told me I would have needed to call by 3:00 pm to cancel and that my stay tomorrow would be filled at the full room charge. I mentioned my call to the hotel earlier on the day and was told ""No one here would have said that. We are all trained to help guests."" When I assured her it had happened she asked who I spoke with since she would need to verify my claim. I reminded her that I spoke with the staff person in the morning for about 30 seconds before I was put on hold and the line went dead and never got a name. The staff person insisted that without being able to verify the conversation there was nothing she could do, since there is no one at the hotel that she knows who would have said something like what I was told. After much back and forth she offered to check with the main office to see who was on duty in the morning but again insisted that no one would have said that they open at 9:00 am and that they could not help me.

We don't have one complaint about this property. As others have stated, the location couldn't be any better. This was our first visit to NYC and I wanted to be within walking distance to everything...we pretty much were. The staff are amazing! Everyone from the desk clerks to the concierge to the bell boys to the bar staff to the housekeeping staff were wonderful. They have a high level of security. We ordered a pizza one night and the front desk called our room to ask if we ordered delivery and then one of the bellmen escorted the delivery guy up to our room and, again, asked if we ordered delivery. I suppose the rooms are not the largest but after visiting Paris anything has to be larger then the room we stayed in there. There is enough room. You won't feel cramped. It is a boutique hotel. The shampoo is the best shampoo I've ever smelt in my life! We were there the week of the Canadian Thanksgiving/American Columbus Day. I wanted to go this time of year to take advantage of the fall foliage. Boy was I disappointed! Not only were all the leaves still green but our first couple of days there it was 23 degrees Celsius! So if you want cooler temps and fall colours you may want to go towards the end of October or early November. We will definitely return to NYC and won't hesitate booking this hotel again. Tip for the ladies: don't worry about being a fashionista. Wear comfy shoes and clothes. I got six blisters our first day wearing a pair of ballet flats. I had to go buy a pair of sneakers and literally wear them out of the store.

On arrival we had a friendly greeting and help with our luggage to our room, then a easy check in which was made all the better when we were offered a free room upgrade to room 903 on the ninth floor. This turned out to be the Presidential Suite with a large bedroom, separate lounge, dinning room and kitchen. The room was clean and well presented with fresh linen and towels as you would expect. The room was cleaned every day with an evening turn down service.The bed was huge and very comfortable. One point we missed was that if we wanted the bed linen changed during our stay we could have used a door sign to inform the staff we need the bed changed. However, our stay was relatively short and this was not an issue. The en suite had a separate bath and shower room with a Jacuzzi bath and gallons of hot water. The only grumble would be that the shower pressure was a bit feeble and not as good as other hotel showers. Hotel staff can make or break a hotel and the staff we encountered were all a credit to the hotel, always friendly and helpful. Vanessa on the Concierge desk helped us with a transport problem and was frequently heard to be arranging theatre tickets and restaurant reservations for other guests. Doorman Seth was a great help with luggage and was a great source of information for places to eat. The location of the hotel was ideal. One block and a short walk to Times Square and well placed to walk to most of the other must see sights of New York. Close enough to Times Square but far enough from the main bustle and noise. There was still some noise intrusion but not enough to disturb our sleep. We did not use the bar or restaurant so we cannot comment on these facilities. I could go on but I think I will conclude with a positive recommendation that visitors to New York would be well advised to consider the Iroquois Hotel as a place to stay. If we return to New York we will book into the Iroquois without any hesitation. We would also he happy to recommend the hotel to family and friends.","Choppington, United Kingdom","ChopsyNorthumbria_</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Choppington, United Kingdom</strong>",62,5.0

While picking a hotel for this stay I saw the Iroquois and was interested until I saw it was in Times Square. We decided to pick another hotel closer to Arthur Ashe stadium since we were coming for the U.S. Open. The second night of our stay a wedding party woke us up at midnight and continued to keep us awake. After repeated calls the hotel staff did nothing even after bringing the front desk clerk up to witness it for himself. We decided that in order to get any sleep that night we would need to find another hotel. That's where the Iroquois came in. The front desk clerk got us a room right away and we checked in around 4 am. He was very compassionate and understanding. We couldn't have asked for better service. The hotel itself is very nice and very quiet. It was like we were the only ones there. We never heard noise from any of the other guests. I wish I had realized when planning this trip that while the Iroquois is in Times Square it is not in the main part so it's a lot less crowded and noisy.

The suite was very spacious, the queen a bit compact but perfectly adequate.The location is excellent for a city break with many attractions an easy walk away and subways nearby to reach those further afield. Staff are friendly and helpful, always available without being intrusive. Free high speed WiFi worked well, the air conditioning was effective (and very welcome in the heatwave we experienced). Coffee is available in the library in the morning and iced fruited water in the afternoon but it would have been good to have a coffee maker in the room and some complimentary bottled water, although there is a 24hr shop nearby which sells water at a fraction of the minibar price!This hotel and its nearby partners offer complimentary walking tours (from Streetwise New York) - we took two and would highly recommend them if your schedule permits.There are many excellent hotels in new York but based on our experience we would definitely recommend the Iroquois and would be happy to return.","Aberdeenshire, United Kingdom","Scotbank11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aberdeenshire, United Kingdom</strong>",23,5.0

SO glad we did. My husband contacted them in advance and asked for a room with natural light and informed them of our anniversary. We were given a room that looked across to other hotels and had a view (just) of the Chrysler Building. With two windows, we got light streaming in first thing in the morning which was lovely - previously we've had to stick out heads out and up to see if the sky was blue!It was nearly midnight when we checked in and were greeted with a complimentary plate of chocolate-dipped fruit, chocolates, a bottle of wine and a lovely card wishing us happy anniversary. A welcome touch after our long flight.The room was spacious by Manhattan standards, with a good-sized and well kitted-out bathroom. The bed was so comfortable I didn't want to leave it when it was time to come home. All in all a very pleasing room.The position of the hotel is good - only a couple of blocks from Times Square but it was far enough for peace and quiet. Ideal.We didn't eat at the hotel as it was soo dark in the restaurant. However, it was always busy so presumably the food is good.For breakfast, the Red Flame Diner a few doors down was good food for a good price.

We found it very easy to get to anywhere from the hotel. The street itself is quite quiet, and we had no noise issues in the room, despite the proximity to busy areas. Our room was just the right size, although anything smaller might be a tight squeeze. This is Midtown Manhattan, however, where rooms tend to be on the smaller size. The room was kept very clean and had all the amenities one could need. Any small requests (ice, extra hangers) were fulfilled quickly and graciously. The air conditioning worked very well - an important plus, as the heat and humidity were high that week - and the bed was extremely comfortable.We didn't have a chance to try Triomphe, but the menu looked great.

I cannot speak highly enough of he bellman, Jason or Josh, I believe his name was. Unfortunately, the hotel restaurant is not open on Saturdays. I am a diabetic, and needed something immediately to eat. So, the young man went to the kitchen, and made me an egg salad sandwich. It cost nearly $20. When I told him I really didn't want to pay that much for an egg salad sandwich, he reached into his pocket, and offered me $20 to pay for it. He knew I was diabetic, and didn't want me to have to wait for a delivery to my room. I, of course, declined the offer. But, his kindness filled my heart. Never has something like this ever happened.On the iffy side, the room was quite small. However, I was only in the city for one night; so, I suppose it was not a big deal. I like the fact that there are doorbells for each room, and the there is a do not disturb switch attached to it. When you flip the switch, it mutes the bell, and flashes a neon sign saying do not disturb. Thought that was cool. There was an issue with my first room, but that was resolved in a matter of minutes, and I was given another.Overall, my stay was extremely pleasant, and I would most definitely recommend this hotel.","Potomac, Maryland","bytheby2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Potomac, Maryland</strong>",31,5.0

The hotel provided everything you could think of - coffee in the lobby in the morning, strawberries in the afternoon. Quick suggestions from the concierge and fantastic service from the door man.At night, the best part was the room quiet - you literally blocked out the noise of NY when you closed your door (now - we had an internal facing room - so no view, but dead quiet - that's a trade off I would always choose).There was a personal touch to the visit very quickly (desk staff, doormen and concierge were the same through the weekend) - warm hellos without being in your face. The best part was we were there for the Puerto Rican day parade (staging right on 44th street). We received a letter the night before from the concierge, warning us if we had travel plans and offering to help - the hotel staff was both 'into' the New York moment and yet kept the lobby quiet and clean.

My partner and I having stayed before in Manhattan, at various locations, found this Midtown hotel to offer the best position for our family's needs. We had a room with two Queen beds, for two adults and a large 12 year old and it was fine. The beds were really comfortable. The room wasn't big, but if you want a large room then you have to pay a lot more (from experience) to get that, especially in New York. If you book a two Queen bed room, that's what you'll get. Also, unless you check into a high rise block hotel, you know you'll have no great view, unless of course you pay for it. This again was not an issue for us. The only real issue I had was the lighting, it was very low.We ate out every day simply because our 12 year old wouldn't have eaten in the main restaurant, but this is easy as there are so many places nearby. A diner is about four shops down from the entrance lobby, just after The Algonquin Hotel. This was a convenient choice on day 1, before you get your bearings.We didn't really use the Concierge much, just to purchase bus tour tickets, but the two staff we saw were really friendly in a genuine way and weren't pushing for business. In fact, the hotel was great in that it was so understated you could come and go and feel like you were in a small apartment building, so unlike one of these 1000 room establishments! Extra highlights are: papers left hanging on your door each morning, umbrellas, a turn down service, flight check in screen in the library, heavy weight bath robes, coffee in the lobby. All in all compared with previous hotel stays in Manhattan this hotel had the most personal service I've noticed, if you so wish to ask for things of course!","Devizes, United Kingdom","Cat E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Devizes, United Kingdom</strong>",47,5.0

I travelled with another 2 females in my family. Upon arrival at the hotel, my first impression was the reception being small/dark/worn, and I noticed the runner carpet was taped up with duck tape! I was a little more than dissapointed.We were checked in quickly as there was no queue - by a friendly receptionist, and we caught the small lift to our room on the 3rd floor. The hotel is described online as a 'boutique hotel', but in my opinion it is far from this status (it was small yes, in a good location yes, but it was not a high grade hotel).Our room was in the far corner of the hotel, and our view was of the back of other hotel rooms which went up so high we didn't have natural daylight coming in. Considering we paid for 3 adults, I was not particularly amused to see 2 small double beds in the room. I immediately went back to reception about the bed situation, but was told that to upgrade to a bigger room with a kingsize bed and a camp bed, it would be another £400. No thanks!The room itself had 2 beds, a small desk, a small minibar - which didn't get cold, a very grubby brown carpet, a small wardrobe, and a tv. it also had a tiny bathroom, and due to lack of natural light in the room and there only being 3 dimly lit lamps (no ceiling light), we couldn't see very well when we wanted to do hair/make-up. The plug sockets were also in a bad position, and i had to crank my neck to get under the desk, onto the floor, to plug in the hairdryer.We didn't let the hotel/room bother us, we had a fantastic time in NY regardless of the small, dark hotel we had booked into because of the great reviews on this site. On the plus side, the hotel is in a perfect location. right on 5th avenue, just a few blocks to the left to rocker feller, and 11 blocks to the right to the left for empire state, 2 blocks straight up to times square, and 7 blocks straight up to the harbour (statue of liberty cruise). The receptionists were all extremely friendly and helpful, the bathroom was stocked with Molton Brown goodies and fluffy robes (but the bath towels were tiny), and the bed was very comfy.We also had umbrellas when it rained, and free coffee in the morning.I would definitely recommend using the hotel airport shuttle for $80 as the car was absolutely luxurious, and the driver was wonderful.I know this review sounds very negative, but I have been to NY before, and always had a much higher standard of accommodation so i did feel let down by this hotel. I would recommend this hotel for small parties/couples only, and for the great location. I would not personally stay here again though as I expect a better standard of hotel accommodation. Finally, if you are going to NY, look into buying city passes (i bought mine on costco for £55 each), as they get you fast entry into top of the rock, empire state, 9/11 memorial museum, statue of liberty cruise, moma, natural history museum. I would also always recommend staying in Midtown to be in walking distance of almost every attraction. And lastly, go to woodbury common outlet centre, via a bus from port authority station for $42, for all your designer shopping needs!",cardiff,"helen l</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>cardiff</strong>",19,3.0

What separates The Iroquois from many other hotels is its wonderful staff. They are warm and inviting individuals who fully understand the words ""customer service"" and they do their very best to assure that their guests are well taken care of while at the hotel. I appreciated the fact that the staff were not little cookie cutter robot types just going through the motions of being nice....they were 100% sincerely nice people. That alone will bring me back to the Iroquois on future trips to NYC. We had a beautifully appointed, spacious one bedroom suite on the 7th floor that faced 44th Street. While some street noise was audible, it was not a negative factor at all. I enjoyed being part of the bustling street activity and I only wish we could have stayed longer at The Iroquois. Excellent bath products, fluffy robes, and a shower with no shortage of hot water were also perks we enjoyed during our stay.","Manchester, Connecticut, United States","Yuki626</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, Connecticut, United States</strong>",61,5.0

I was not as impressed as other guests, although it is a nice hotel. We had a Deluxe King room. The room was of an acceptable size, not tiny but not that big either. There was a desk on one side of the bed, a chair on the other side, and just enough room to walk comfortably around the bed, but barely. The bathroom was very small, with a small bathtub, tight next to the sink, and the sink tight next to the toilet. I carry many bathroom products (perfume, cosmetics, contact lenses and rinser, etc) and I had nowhere to place them. Room decor is very traditional, in very good shape, but somewhat boring.Location is just fantastic, close to so many attractions, and with several subway stations from different lines at walking distance, it is convenient for going everywhere in Manhattan. I found it annoying that they put a sign on the room refrigerator warning that you cannot use it for your own stuff or they will charge you. It is unnecessarily rude, and an unreasonable restriction.Service personnel at the front desk and concierge were polite and professional. The elevators are a bit slow which can be annoying if you are always on a hurry, but not an issue if you are relaxed on vacation time. Our room faced the back of the building, and it was very quiet (as requested) but had limited natural light and ugly view. If you would rather trade a bit of street noise to improve on these, ask for a front room.Good wifi, included in the room price.","Buenos Aires, Argentina","Maria A A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Buenos Aires, Argentina</strong>",56,4.0

The driver arrived and was waiting with a smile as we left the customs hall at the airport so we had door to door service. The cost of the car was simply added to our room account. The rooms were both lovely, different views, but both spotlessly clean and cosy. They made an effort so we were on the same floor but not next door to each other (what we had requested). The beds are very comfortable and everything worked well in the room. Neither room was huge but both perfectly able to accommodate us and all our luggage (and shopping!).We spoke to the concierge on a few occasions and he was so helpful with both suggestions for where to eat/directions/ideas etc. So please do chat to him if you visit as he is a real font of information. The reception area is small but again lovely and the hot complementary drink in the lobby was great both morning and arriving back after a hard days sightseeing.On one evening my husband and I ate in the restaurant and then had drinks in the cocktail bar.

We travelled from Washington DC via Amtrak. Although the hotel appears small from the outside, it's actually really quite large. The hotel is warm and inviting, not like some of the ultra modern hotel that are around. I chose this hotel based solely on location and the fantastic reviews. It is rated highly and is certainly worth such a high rating. When I booked it was number 19 out of over 400 hotels in New York!!We were super impressed by every aspect of the hotel. We loved the evening turn down service. It was lovely to come back to the room and have a little chocolate placed on our pillow. Also we loved the facility whereby you could borrow movies. Although we were on a huge sightseeing trip, we aren't drinkers or clubbers (my mum and I) so there wasn't an appeal to be out late in the evenings. Therefore each night we would come back and watch a movie. Really sweet extra!We had breakfast a few times in the hotel restaurant. It was lovely, calm and high quality. I fancied cereal and even though it wasn't on the menu, a fanatic bowl of cornflakes arrived for me! A much needed thing from home.The toiletries in the room were Molton Brown and were constantly being replenished. The rooms were perfect size for us and had all we needed. I only felt I wanted a ceiling light to do my makeup in the mornings, but that's nothing majorly important as I simply did it in the bathroom instead.All the staff were lovely and polite.Two people went the extra mile for us and definitely deserve mentioning!! Bill, the concierge, was fantastic. He helped sort an issue from our previous city and helped booked a visit to the 9/11 memorial, he also gave us advice about where to go and eat etc. i.e the New York pass verses the New York City pass (we chose the prior). But more than the help was his genuine and sincere kindness. I felt that nothing was too much trouble and this means so much generally, let alone in an unfamiliar country/city. The other person was Seth, the hotel porter. He was such a friendly welcoming face at the end and beginning of our days. He remembered who we were and asked about our day etc. Although New York isn't on the holiday agenda for many years now, I highly recommend staying and utilising the skills and expertise of the people who work and live in the city. If we win the lottery, we will certainly be back soon.

What really got me was this one guy that was working there, after a decent conversation, he recommended that I check out a few places around the town and sure enough they were great places to visit. A tall, Im guessing Indian fella named Sagar, but I think he used another name. But after much talking I got the appropriate name. Good suggestion of what to visit, and enjoy my stay, great detail on the location and good reccomendation on the drink aswell. If he reads this, he should know ""not to be a lemon"".

(For these rates, I'd have expected a bit more of the interior, particularly the rooms, to have been updated.) My big complaint, however, came 4 months after my stay, when a staff member at the hotel contacted me, claiming that I still owed an outstanding balance that they'd never even sought to charge me for when I was there. She blamed it on Expedia (through which I'd made the reservation), claiming that Expedia had originally given them incorrect information-- which, after a long time on the phone with Expedia, I found out to be blatantly untrue (and thus just an attempt to avoid taking responsibility for the hotel's own mistake). When I brought this deception to the attention of the general manager of the Iroquois, I didn't even get an apology (sincere or otherwise). I've paid the amount they claimed I owed, but with so many other hotels in the area, I can't comprehend why I'd ever return to one where the staff has such a cavalier attitude toward the truth.

We stated no, so eventually they found a room for us. The room i had reserved was Superior Queen. I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT THE STANDARD QUEEN ROOM LOOKED LIKE. Our room was so tiny, that if you went to answer the phone, you woke the other person up, because you could not get by the bed to reach for the phone, if you went to the bathroom, the door opened into the bed, once again waking anyone sleeping at the time. The bed was a DOUBLE, not a queen. When i asked the gentleman at the front the desk on our way out, he insisted that there are different kinds of queen beds. I am 63 years old, and never knew that there were queen size of various measurements. If there are, please show them to me. This was definetly a double size bed, and believe me there is a difference, when you are 6 feet, 2 inches tall. So this will be my last time staying here.

Picked it for the low corporate rate, proximity to the office I was visiting and TripAdvisor reviews. Small room had two double beds (as a practical matter, really only big enough for one person), a rolling office chair in front of the small table between the beds, and one easy chair. The room would be suitable only for two people and one open suitcase at a time. You would have to make an effort to find a place to stash a second suitcase - possibly in the small closet. Bathroom was arguably nicer than the room and there were enough small shelves to hold a shaving kit and toiletries. The hotel makes good use of limited space in the bathroom. I slept well and had no problem with noise, but did hear people from the narrow hallway outside my room.A couple of issues keep me from giving this hotel a higher overall rating. Shortly after I got into the room I heard a noise I couldn't place. I then heard the doorknob turning and before I knew it the housekeeper was in my room with a chocolate and the next day's weather forecast. While I appreciated the offer of the turndown service, the time between ringing the bell on the door (that's the noise I did not recognize) and entering the room was far too short. In addition, the room was stuffy on a 50-degree day (fortunately I was able to crack open the bathroom window to cool things down - windows that open are an advantage of an older hotel), and a number of TV channels would not come in. I had a mixed experience with the WiFi - I was able to connect my tablet but not my work laptop.Shop around and if you can find a good rate, this hotel could be a good value in a prime location in an extremely expensive city.",North Carolina,"ExWriter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Carolina</strong>",34,3.0

I had mentioned, when I made the reservation, that we were celebrating his birthday, and there was a fruit and chocolate platter and a split of pinot noir waiting for us in our suite - complimentary! The furnishings were comfortable and generous. Everything was a bit on the dated side, but still very usable, which enhanced the comfortable opulence of the place. There is nothing garish here: you get the same feeling as you do when you slip on your favorite pair of slippers.We were so glad we opted for the suite - which gave the four of us plenty of space. The girls said the pull out couch was comfy - with a memory foam mattress. Our king bed was amazingly comfortable. The place was spotless and well stocked. I do wish they had given us two more water glasses, we had two and then two wine tumblers, which were rather large and hard to handle - and I'm sure we could've called down and had them sent up; but we didn't bother, since we were there such a short time.We returned from the show to freshen up for our dinner downstairs at The Triomphe, to find our beds pleasantly turned down and the room spruced up. The next day, we left our luggage with the bell service and kept the car with the valet while we went to the Guggenheim. We were impressed the doorman remembered us each and every time, and asked after our day, if we were enjoying our stay - just very caring. It was the same with the bell service. And they never hung around for tips. They helped us and then were immediately helping others. We would turn around to tip and they would be gone. It's these little touches that added to our comfort and made us feel so well taken care of.This hotel is small and clearly knows their niche.

My room was fairly roomy (considering the pigeon holes I've stayed at in the past in NYC) and well-appointed. The queen bed was comfy. The room came with a decent-sized work table and a chest of drawers to put away clothes. There's also a small closet to hang suits and jackets, which also holds the room safe and a steam iron (VERY handy when you have to run for meetings right after check-in). Can't say much for the view from the room's windows - they looked out into an atrium of some sort between the hotel and the next building. There's a 32-inch LCD TV with a DVD player. Didn't use this much as US tv channels annoy the hell out of me with an overdose of ads. Oh, and there's complimentary high speed wifi that works on at least 2 devices at a time. My only possible gripe about the room was the low levels of lighting. There are no ceiling lights and you need to turn on all the standing lamps (bed-side, on the table) to make the room seem a little lively. The bathroom (sparkling clean) has a tub/shower cubicle combo, Molton Brown bathroom products and lots of towels. Service was quite good. The staff was friendly and extremely helpful, This was evident from the fact that my boss (who was traveling with me) is a tyrant as far as keeping hotel staff on their toes is concerned, and he left feeling very satisfied. Housekeeping checked in twice a day to tidy up the room and to carry out the evening turn down. Food was excellent, although the Iroquois doesn't have a very large in-room dining selection. The in house restaurant, Triomphe, is really excellent though. The best thing about the place, of course, is that it's in the heart of Manhattan (West 44th st.) and a few minutes' walk from Times Square and Central Park. While it's not exactly cheap (my room went for an average of USD 300 a night), it's also not ludicrously expensive like some of the bigger chain hotels in the vicinity.

She fulfilled our request for a quiet room on an upper floor, and arranged for a treat of wine, chocolate covered strawberries, and chocolates to help us begin our anniversary celebration. Lisa assigned us room 1210 which was on the top floor and located away from elevators and stairs. The room and bathroom were spacious. The room was tastefully and comfortably furnished and well-maintained - no marks on walls; no chipped, peeling, or stained furniture. It appears that the hotel may recently have been updated or renovated. The bed was very comfortable. Even halls were tastefully decorated with sconces, mirrors, paneling and borders; again, not a scratch or mar marked the walls.We enjoyed a special meal at Triomphe, the hotel restaurant. It was excellent, but I save more comments for the restaurant review.We also were very impressed by the attentiveness and helpfulness of the staff. I apologize for not remembering names of the doormen, but someone always was at the door to wish us a great day or to welcome us back after our forays into Manhattan. The concierge was always available if we had questions.The location of the Iroquois was perfect for us. The main reason for selecting this location was proximity to Broadway theatres without staying in the midst of the noise and commotion of Times Square. Bus stops nearby provided convenient access and routes to museums on Fifth Avenue, to restaurants in lower Manhattan, and to shopping. Finding taxis never posed a problem. Also, we walked to St. Patrick's Cathedral, Saks, the New York Library, and other nearby venues.Reservations gave us excellent rates; they honored lower rates even after I booked the room.The Iroquois is an older, elegant, and refined hotel, the kind that we prefer.

This is our fifth stay in the hotel over as many years - we've tried others in the City but keep returning to this boutique hotel as we love it so much. Why??1. Location - not even 5 minutes walk to Times Square yet in a quiet street you wouldn't know all the neon and bright lights are just by. It's also the same distance from 5th Avenue and about 8 minutes walk to Grand Central Station.2. Staff are friendly and polite. Very helpful. 3. Hotel itself is lovely - small and boutique, luxurious rooms, chocolates at turn down, towelling robes, molton brown toiletries, lovely beds and bedding. Quiet rooms. The last couple of times we've got a good price for a suite which has a kingsize bed and double sofa bed in the lounge area. 2 TVs, I Pod docking station etc.There is complimentary coffee served in the foyer in the morning and hot apple cider in the afternoon..The only thing that's disappointing is that I they don't provide complimentary bottled water in the rooms. It's available but chargeable along with a well stocked fridge of chargeable items. However on my most recent visit they provided a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates and on the previous visit a complimentary breakfast for us all. I think this was because we've visited so many times - oh yes, this time we were able to check in at 9 am on the day of a arrival and were able to check out 2 pm on the day of departure which was really great. I guess these things depend on the room situation.I would highly recommend - you won't be disappointed. Also visit the Red Flame Diner which is almost next door - great for a traditional American breakfast.

First of all the staff: both the housekeeping and front desk staff members are incredibly professional and most importantly, friendly. They are very helpful and really are a welcome sight after dealing with flights, taxi’s and traffic outside. The hotel itself is small and charming. This year, they treated us to an upgrade, which was very kind of them to do. Our room was larger than the year before when we stayed, with a much bigger bathroom and closet. The location of the Iroquois is perfect. It’s close to Bryant Park, Grand Central Terminal, the theater district and the Subway. It’s the perfect spot to start a walk towards Central Park just to take in the sights and sounds of Manhattan.

Boutique hotel with a gym and sauna, I never used it but it is there if you need one. Beds were very comfortable, and you have a choice of foam or feather pillows. I usually travel with my pillow but I used their feather pillows and they were great. Rooms are clean, quiet, staff was excellent and two elevators is a perk. We stayed in a room with two double beds and it was quit large for New York standards. The location is 2 blocks from Bryant Park/NY library so you are smack in the middle of many things to see. Theatre district is 3 blocks away, Macy's is a 10 minute walk, Rockerfeller Centre is about 10 minutes the other way. Subway stations close by depending on which direction you are going. Great coffee shop across the street called Gregory's, good breakfast/lunch spot 4 doors down called The Red Flame, and if you want a late night drink (hotel has bars but they close pretty early) there is the Blue Bar a few doors down. You can't beat their location. Free WIFI which is rare in NY.

The hotel is perfectly situated a short walk from Time Square and 5th avenue, and only 15 minutes walk from Rockerfella Centre, Central Park, and the taxis are fairly cheap and reliable for other distances around New York. The staff made us feel very welcome and comfortable, and went above and beyond as we were visiting as part of our honeymoon on this trip. The hotel has a charming feel of a classy traditional hotel with a warm feel from the dark wood, and you feel like your at home or staying with friends. Our Room was spacious for the cost (NYC is often expensive for small rooms, not the case here), bed was excellent, rooms well equipped and the Molton Brown toiletries were another luxury touch. The staff could not do more for you as guests and are extremely friendly and smiley. One time we asked for a cab when the road was solid full of traffic, and the doorman went off to 6th avenue, and fetched a cab for us. Concierge also had no problems organising us a towncar transport to Newark at 4am. The ONLY slight thing was that the hot air heating system made a little noise when on, but thats the only down point throughout this hotel!Hotel also provides free coffee in the morning, and free hot apple cider in the afternoon (note that this is American for nice warm apple juice, not the alcoholic version)We will happily make this our hotel when visiting New York again in the future as we had such a lovely stay this time.Just a word of warning for any new visitors to New York, be aware of taxi touts at airports, who come up to you and offer taxis to the centre, these are unlicensed and will charge you a stupid amount on your arrival, make sure you stick to yellow cabs which are available right outside the terminals (yellow cabs are $52 plus tolls and $0.80 surcharge from JFK to Manhattan fixed the touts ask for $150), or official licensed towncars, or hotel arranged shuttles or transport.

There were about 5 on my final list, all in various areas of the city, but all in this price bracket. We finally decided on The Iroquois because of the location and also the positive reviews it had on Trip Advisor.The location is great. Located down a fairly quiet (for NYC) street, it's only a couple of minutes to the hustle and bustle of Times Square and the theatre district, and the fantastic shops up and down 5th Ave. This suited us perfectly, and we did a lot of walking as a result, and didn't have to worry about cabs or the subway. The room itself was very comfortable but there wasn't much space around the bed (we were expecting it to be small, as most hotel rooms in NYC are said to be). The only lights in the room were 2 bedside lamps, and a standing lamp in the corner. These didn't provide a huge amount of light for the room. There was very little natural light from the window as there was a large building directly outside blocking it, but as we didn't spend a great deal of time in here aside from sleeping, it wasn't a real issue. The bed was very big and extremely comfortable. I slept very well, until being woken in the morning. The bathroom was spacious and comfortable. The service team were very friendly and polite, and were very happy to help with suggestions and recommendations on things to do and the best way to get to places. They were happy to store our luggage for us when we checked out as we had a late flight, and they arranged for a car to collect us from the hotel and take us to the airport for a reasonable rate.There were however a few downsides to our stay, and these were:Whilst we were there, renovation was taking place on part of our floor. This meant that most mornings at 8am, we were woken by workmen starting work. One morning, they were laying a protective sheeting along the floor, which was quite noisy.The hot water in the bathroom sink came out in a dribble which was a nuisance. Also, the plug in the sink didn't actually stay down properly, so it wasn't possibly to fill the sink with water without keeping the tap running. Finally, as mentioned previously, there wasn't a lot of light in the room.Those few things didn't come close to ruining our stay, we had a great time, and will certainly be back.",London,"Mark S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",84,4.0

The location was perfect, near everything in midtown, time square was a few minutes away. The hotel as a New York charm that really complimented the whole experience. If your looking for an hotel in New York, you won't go wrong here. They made us welcome, they kept our cases until we were ready to fly after checking out. They also booked us a car to the airport for 80 dollars, this in my opinion was worth every penny. The driver arrived in time, took care of the luggage. He was very friendly, polite and very safe, the car was far superior to a New York taxi and by far more comfortable.Honestly I can not recommend the Iroquois enough, it just enhanced what was a great experience of a great city.

There is a also a convenient subway station nearby. From the minute we arrived the staff couldn't have been more helpful. We had suites in the hotel and they were both very spacious. There was a living room with a sofa bed in and a bedroom with a king size bed in. We travel a lot and I can honestly say that the beds, pillows and linens were the comfiest I have experienced. The room was kept very clean and the chocolates on your pillow at turn down are a nice touch. The bathroom was kept very well stocked with gorgeous Molton Brown products and the shower was powerful and there was plenty of hot water.

If you try to ring the bell on the door, it will light up and say ""do not disturb"". A nice and thoughtful touch. We did ask for a wake up call at 6 PM because we were going to see the show which started at 8 PM. The only thing is that the Front Desk called earlier and asked if everything was to our expectations. This was a nice touch, but, not necessary.

Check in was fast and friendly and the room was very nice. NY rooms tend to be on the small size for obvious reasons, but the room here did not feel cramped at all. The one complaint of the stay was the bar. We went down for a drink before dinner and even though there was only one person sitting at the (smallish) bar we were stopped at the door and told we needed a reservation to sit at the bar at that time. The person who stopped us and informed us of this was not particularly friendly. Later in the evening (11ish) we tried again for a nightcap and were once again stopped at the door and rudely told they were closed. So we took our business to the beautiful Blue Bar at the Algonquin next door.

Everyone from the front desk to the door people were easy to get along with and quick to respond to our questions and requests.The Concierge (Bill) is the best guy for the hotel to have up front because his knowledge of the city is excellent and he will help you with places to eat, and more specific things that will make your experience of the New York more full.

The room was of a good standard, if slightly tired, but very clean. The frequently replenished Molton Brown in the bathroom was also a nice touch, as was the free daily paper every morning. We didn't eat at the hotel, but did manage to squeeze a few cocktails in during our stay at Lantern's Keep (the in-house cocktail bar); the cocktails were fantastic but very expensive. The hotel is in a great location, not far from Times Square (10 minute walk), but don't let that put you off either as the road is quiet compared to others (and what I expected). Along the same road there is a breakfast restaurant called The Red Flame Diner that provides the best American breakfast sandwiches I've ever had, and it's cheap. We also enjoyed an evening at the Taverna restaurant just along the road, a sophisticated location for dinner, and I must say the house red was really good. Above everything though, the single best thing about The Iroquois, in our opinion, was Vanessa. Vanessa is the lady who helps guests' book and arrange everything from cab journeys to theatre and tour tickets.

Check in isn't normally until 3pm but I had emailed a few weeks earlier to advise of our early arrival and they told me that they would make every effort to sort us an early check in but could not guarantee it, however in the event that the room wasn't ready they would happily store our bags so that we didn't have to wait around. As it happened when we arrived at around 10:30am our room was ready so we were able to check in. One of the Doormen (Carlos I think he was called) brought our bags up for us. The room was lovely. Not the biggest but still plenty of space and very well looked after. There were complimentary bottles of water for us, Ironing board and iron in the wardrobe as well as a large chest of drawers and a writing table. The Bathroom was a decent size and the shower was great. Complimentary WiFi in the hotel, you are given a code in your check in paperwork. There isn't a fridge, there is a minibar however we were advised that this is not to be used as a fridge as moving things in there would trigger sensors which would lead to us being charged, but if we wanted a fridge, they would provide us with one. The room didn't have a view, however this is a 12 storey building in Midtown Manhattan. There are no views in this part of town!The Front desk staff were very helpful, on check in I asked if there was a map of the area he could give me. He obliged and opened it up and marked on there the location of the hotel and then asked if there was anything specific we were hoping to see and marked those on the map for us as well. Just a little extra touch but was greatly appreciated.The next day we were going to the Statue of Liberty. On leaving the hotel we were greeted by Carlos once again who pointed us in the direction of Times Square Subway station and told us that we needed to get on the Red Line. Every time we left or returned to the hotel we were greeted by Carlos or Ezra with a smile, and always asked what we'd been doing and how we were and if there was anywhere we needed directions for. I know it's their job but it really was appreciated.For our departure, the hotel has an airport transfer service which I would highly recommend using. It cost us $105 (roughly £65) to go to Newark airport, which is probably near enough what it would cost you in a Yellow Taxi but a hell of a lot more comfortable (and again with a complimentary bottle of water) This was arranged the previous day with the Concierge desk who are also very helpful. At the front of the hotel there is a small library with a computer and printer which can be used to print off boarding passes (Or in my case tickets to see the Knicks at Madison Square Garden after a last minute decision) There is also in the lobby a machine which in the morning dispenses coffee and in the afternoon and evening Cucumber water (again complimentary)The best feature without a doubt of this hotel is it's location. 44th between 5th and 6th. 10 blocks to the South, you have Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden and Macys. 15 Blocks to the North you have Central Park and Bloomingdales (Rockerfeller Center and St Pats Cathedral will be passed on the way) less than a minute out of the door and you're on 5th Avenue in the heart of the shops. 5 minutes walk to the East and you are in the middle of Times Square. The majority of the major Theatres are all within 10 minutes walk. Subway station is 5 minute walk, Taxis are relatively easy (dependent on time of day) to flag down on either 5th or 6th. The doorman will do his best to flag you one down, but you don't really get many coming down 44th and the ones that do are usually flagged down by doorman at hotels further up the road. The beauty of it though is that whilst you are so close to the heart of everything, you are just far enough away for the noise and madness that is Times Square to not be an issue. On the corner of 44th and 6th there is a Duane Reed convenience store which will have any essential supplies that you may need.There is a restaurant attached to the hotel, however we did not use it so I am unable to comment. There are a large number of restaurants, cafes and sandwich shops all very close by and we ate out throughout or stay. To conclude we thoroughly enjoyed The Iroquois and ""WHEN"" we go back to New York we will most definitely be staying there. Its not the cheapest place to stay in New York by any stretch but it's well worth it for the location, the friendliness of staff and the fantastic service that is provided here.

It’s extremely convenient if you want to go updown or downtown and drop off your shopping mid-day so you can go shop some more without being weighed down. The hotel is situated in a busy area of Manhattan, even if you are walking back to the hotel late at night (i.e. 12am), there are still people on the streets and lots of cars on 5th Avenue, so you don’t have to be particularly concerned about safety issues. db bistro modern by Daniel Boulud (3* Michelin chef) is just 2 doors down, so if you’re too tired to go out for dinner, you can always try their delicious burger!The Superior room is a bit small, but that was expected from reading all the previous reviews. It was adequate for a single traveler like myself. My room was facing 44th Street, so there was no view, but I wasn’t planning to spend much time in the hotel. The hotel is elegantly furnished and the room was clean. Lighting was adequate in the room, which is great as many hotel rooms are too dim. The bathroom was decent sized and you don’t feel too cramped. Molton Brown amenities are provided which is great, so I didn’t have to bring my own shampoo, conditioner, body wash and body lotion. Some hotels don’t provide good amenities hence you have to pack everything in your suitcase. One problem I had with the bathroom was that there was nowhere to put all my toiletries and make-up as they have a pedestal sink, hence there is no counter for you to place your personal items. They do have 2 tiny glass shelves above the toilet, but it’s hardly enough space to put all your stuff properly without having to worry they will drop into the toilet at any moment. Housekeeping provided more than enough towels during my stay and it was probably too much (should be more environmentally friendly) as I had 4 small towels (which I didn’t use) on the shelf above the toilet and I was a single guest in the room. The air conditioning in the room was a bit cold and as the temperature is centrally controlled, there wasn’t much the staff could do about it. But I guess it’s better that the room is slightly too cold rather than being too hot, else you really can’t sleep during the summer months (I visited end of June). There is free wifi throughout the hotel, but I had problems with the signal strength in my room and in the hallways. I was staying on the 4th floor and I couldn’t make calls on Skype as the connection wasn’t very good. I had to go down to the library/computer room at the lobby where I got a better connection and was able to make my calls. I notified the reception of my problem and straight away they tried to call their internet service provider and try to sort out the problem. Although I couldn’t get a better signal in my room at the end, it was great to know that the staff really care about the guest’s needs and provide immediate assistance.There is a platter of fresh strawberries by the reception desk which you could help yourself to. This is a great treat to the guests, every time you pass by the reception you couldn't help taking a couple of strawberries. They also have ice water infused with orange and lemon slices in the lobby during the day, so it’s great to be able to quench your thirst as soon as you walk into the hotel after being outside in the summer heat. The small library/computer room at the lobby is a great place to relax/wait for your friends. They have 2 computers and a printer which you can use, free of charge, which is great for printing out travel itineraries/boarding passes. Other hotels often charge you for printing (even for 1 page), which is very annoying.Before my arrival, I called the hotel asking if they were willing to keep a package for me prior to my arrival and they said it was not a problem. This was extremely helpful for me as I had to send something to repair in the States and they could only send back the item to a US address. Hence I had the item sent to the hotel prior to my arrival. After I had checked-in and arrived in my room, a member of the staff knocked on the door and delivered the package straight away. So if you want to do a bit of online shopping prior to arrival, rest assured it will be safely kept until you check-in. But do call ahead just to let them know so they are expecting your package.All members of the staff are extremely friendly and helpful which is clearly the best asset of this hotel. I’ve travelled worldwide and stayed in many hotels, but I’m truly impressed with the level of service at Iroquois. I did not have a chance to interact with all members of their staff, but one person in particular was extremely helpful – their Concierge, Bill Heinrichs. He’s absolutely the best, even better than other Concierge at 5* properties elsewhere. He’s friendly and can help you with anything. Do remember to look for him during your stay and just let him know what you would like to do/see/eat/drink during your stay and I’m sure he will give you great advice that even the best guidebook won’t mention. Another staff at their Concierge desk, Vanessa was also very friendly and helpful.The hotel is not cheap, but you’re paying for the location, quality and great customer service, which is all worth it. I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to New York. If you are like me and trowel though pages and pages of reviews on Tripadvisor before booking any hotel, you will understand why there is consistently such positive reviews for this hotel after you have experienced it yourself.

After stepping out the front door, within a couple of minutes you can be at Times Square if you turn left, Grand Central Station if you turn right, Rockefeller Center if you go uptown and the Public Library if you head downtown. Yes, Empire State is a few more blocks and a few more minutes further away, but this is Manhattan and everything is ... but nothing's too far away. But I'm not here to sell you on New York. The shuttle bus driver knew exactly where it was, how to get to it through the one-way system and that he'd be able to readily park right outside to drop us off. The reception team welcomed us like it was our hundredth stay, not our first. There was hot cider in the lobby to take the edge off the chill from outdoors. We had an inside room on one of the higher floors away from the lifts and never noticed any noise. Yes, the room was a little more compact than it might have been and we had a panoramic view of absolutely nothing, but it wasn't a concern. No disrespect to the Iroquois, but we weren't there to spend hours admiring their hotel.

Our room was large for a hotel room in the City - the bathroom was palatial for New York. We did complain that the room was a little too hot, however the front desk adjusted the thermostat immediately to make us more comfortable. The bed was good and they had a selection of a firm and a feather pillow for each person. The closet was fine. The desk in the room was narrow enough I wouldn't have wanted to spend any time working at it. The lobby is nice and they keep coffee out in the mornings and iced water in the afternoon and evening which we always really enjoyed after coming in from walking around. The staff was incredibly professional, friendly, and accommodating. The hotel bar is also pretty cool. The only reason it isn't 5 star is because it's not a ""luxury"" hotel like some other (much much more expensive hotels) you could find. We like a mixture of luxury and value and in my opinion the Iroquois is a great value. You'll be comfortable during your stay and the staff will make sure that your stay is a pleasant one.

Ditto for the view. We're just there for a comfortable place to stay. Which leads me to the big sticking point with the hotel. The temperature control is centrally handled so we could not adjust the a/c in our room. Comfort is important to me and the room was just too hot for us at night. We were able to fall asleep because we were tired from being on the go and having had several drinks. However, if not for that, I would have had a hard time sleeping. Hate to say it considering everything else was great, but I would not book with this hotel again because of that. When traveling, I need to be comfortable.

First, the positives. The location is fantastic--it's an easy walk to Times Square/theaters, to many restaurants, Rockefeller Center, and several museums. The rooms are immaculate--we booked a Deluxe King--and the staff is very friendly. The woman working at the check-in desk was helpful and when the first room we were given was on the second floor facing a dark wall, she moved us to a higher floor with no problem. Turndown service is also incredibly friendly. Knocking first (some hotels are terrible about this), chocolates for your pillow, and a card noting the next day's weather. Now, the not-so-positives. The room was freezing...the AC was cranked up, but changing the thermostat didn't seem to help. It's also quite dark. Even with all the lamps turned on, it's not too bright in the room. Great if all you need is to sleep, not so great if you need to work. The bathroom, while very clean and boasting luxurious fixtures, is tiny. There isn't a spot to put your toiletries, as the glass shelves are narrow and already contain extra toilet paper and towels. If you have a makeup bag, you'll have to put down the toilet seat and set it there. And a biggie: no plugs in the bathroom. We couldn't believe it and searched high and low, but nothing. If you want to use a heat appliance for your hair, you have to do it in the main room. Overall, I'd give it four out of five stars, because it's clean, safe, and the staff is extremely friendly. Not sure I'd choose it again, though, given the other choices nearby at a similar price point.","Boston, MA","NicB70</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, MA</strong>",41,4.0

We were so grateful when reception unexpectedly told us we could check in immediately. Very impressed with that and being able to get a few hours sleep before venturing out into Times Square meaning our first day was not a write off.Being on our honeymoon they also brought wine and chocolates to the room which was a lovely touch, although I'd forgotten to put the Do Not Disturb button on and as I staggered out of bed to answer the door still half asleep and dressed only in my underpants the poor hotel staff were probably not as impressed with their view as I was with their kind gesture!The room was very compact but well laid out given the space, the ""view"" from our window was of an alley outside and the sky was hidden by an enclosed high rise in every direction so you couldn't even tell if it was day or night but it meant the room was very quiet despite being in the middle of all the hustle and bustle. The carpet was a little worn and dated but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean. We'd been warned not to expect too much from NYC hotel rooms but considering the reasonable price and the location of the hotel we were satisfied. We were on the 3rd leg of our honeymoon having visited Vegas and Hawaii so the hotel room was always going to be less extravagant but the point of New York isn't staying in your room anyway.We booked a Broadway show through the ever helpful concierge Bill and this hotel is the perfect location for the theatre district. We saw Les Mis and my wife enjoyed it but I must admit although I love live comedy, music and entertainment, musical theatre is never going to be my thing. I tried to look for other husbands who'd been dragged along but they all seemed to love it. I swear the guy sat next to me actually cried and they weren't tears of boredom like mine. Maybe it was the $30 dollars you had to pay for double whiskey and coke! Luckily the concierge Bill had more wine sent up to our room free to help us celebrate! Top man.The hotel is the perfect base to explore Manhattan. We found the subway quite easy to use but to be fair as long as you have a reasonable pair of shoes you could walk around all of NYC and there's so much to see. We spent an entire sunny day in the beautiful (and free) Central Park, went to the top of the Rock for the outstanding views, took in live (and free) musical performances in Greenwich Village, walked the (free again!) High Line, took the (free) Staten Island Ferry to see the Statue of Liberty, visited the humbling 9/11 Memorial and we paid in to the visitor centre which was well worth it and very emotional, and were taken out in New Jersey by friends we'd met in Hawaii for stunning views of the Manhattan cityscape, there's a great bar called Nevada Smith's for the football (soccer!) during the World Cup, just a shame about our England team being a let down as usual, but our favourite night was The Comedy Cellar in Greenwich Village followed by great live music at Cafe Wha. We were so impressed by how much you could do and see that was free like Union Sq or Washington Sq and I will definitely return to NYC.By the 5th day all I would say is I was a bit over Times Sq. As a first timer in NY I'm glad I experienced the beating heart of Manhattan but after a few days battling the crowds, touts and hustlers I was a bit sick of the area. We found Greenwich Village and the Meatpacking District much more to our liking and will probably try and stay there next time.If you do want to stay near Times Square though then the Iroquois is a great base at a very reasonable price with nice little complimentary touches like the best tasting, fresh strawberries on the reception desk every morning and iced water garnished with oranges, lemons or cucumbers which was very welcome after another day pounding the city streets!The lobby area is nice, we didn't go into the bar The Lanterns Keep but it looked a great little hideaway, the rooms are adequate but best of all the staff made our stay great with the early check in, little gifts and helpful advice.We did come back to an unexpected minibar bill on our credit card that we hadn't signed for and certainly hadn't used $102 worth of items. We think we did use some mini bar but it was a lot more modest figure than what we had been charged. Again though credit to Iroquois, one email to the reception and Jazmin wiped the bill to apologise for the confusion and refunded the credit card. This was above and beyond what we expected and again all credit to them. The ""can do"", helpful attitude of the staff is certainly the highlight of The Iroquois.","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","GeordieDave</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom</strong>",3,4.0

The hotel is located between 5th & 6th street so there're amenities close by, not to mention shopping on 5th. There is, 'The Red Flame Diner' 3-4 doors down on the right as you exit the hotel. This is good for a cheap breakfast. We mainly ate at Times Deli on 44th but closer to 7th on the left. Good breakfast and a good place to stock up before you hit the subway.

I had meetings in the area, have regularly stayed at a good hotel nearby but wanted to find another mid-town hotel for regular business use.The traditionally-styled lobby is small (a good thing) allowing quick entry and exit. Front desk staff were very helpful and attentive without any of the artificial fawning found at a lot of boutique and would-be boutique hotels these days. Check in was quick and easy and the two small elevators are just a step away from the desk.The small ""Executive"" room was both fine and a disappointment. They got the most important thing very right: the room was very quiet and the bed exceptionally comfortable. The musty smell on entry was not so welcoming.As a very frequent business traveler, details that may seem petty to an occasional traveler count.  - The desk lamp was not plugged in. Not a big deal. Just move the chair aside, get down on the floor at the edge of the desk and plug it in.  - There was no hair-dryer. Having unsucessfully searched, I called the front desk and was politely told it was in the second drawer of the dresser; except it wasn't. Another call to the desk and a dryer was courteously delivered 10 minutes later. Perhaps a prior guest stole the dryer but why isn't the presence of a dryer on the housekeeping checklist when turning a room after a check-out? - there was no luggage rack in the closet, leaving the top of the dresser the only place to place my roller-bag (BTW, thus partially blocked the TV; see below). I could have easily called for one but didn't bother. - TV isn't important to me and I didn't even turn it on so I don't care about this but one so-often wonders whether people designing hotel rooms ever actually stay in mock-ups of the rooms they design. The large-screen TV, mounted on the wall above the dresser and facing the bed, was not visible from where the single easy-chair was placed and the room was too small to move the chair to a place where the TV was comfortably viewable.The property is attractive and well maintained. The room decor is very nice. The staff are very pleasant and helpful. The location is great for mid-town business or access to the theater district. Wi-Fi was stable and fast. The price was reasonable. So the Iroquois has a lot to offer.

Taxis are easily available right outside the door. The front desk, concierge, door, and bell staff were consistently kind and polite, greeting us each time we walked in from the craziness that is NYC, and providing any assistance needed :) No, really...you will not believe how tranquil and welcoming the Iroquois really is until you experience it. Our room was on the 10th floor and very quiet. There are two elevators, so we never waited more than a minute.The rooms was small because this is NYC, where space is a premium, but room layout was maximized by furniture placement, etc. We never felt cramped, and believe me, we did not pack light! Plenty of drawer and closet space to store our ""millions of clothes and shoes,"" and even the proverbial kitchen sink! Comfortable beds! The bathroom was also small but quite sufficient for our needs; great Molton Brown products for use. Housekeeping was awesome, and nightly turndown service, with chocolates on our pillows, made the whole experience even better. There is free in-room wifi for guests, and when it's time to leave, the Library off the lobby has computers with printers for guests to print boarding passes.

It is located very close to most attractions, yet just far enough from the Times Square madness that you can avoid the crowds. The last hotel we stayed at we had to fight the crowds every time we wanted to take the subway. The rooms are not big but they are tastefully decorated and have wonderful bedding. I didn't love the pedestal sink because there wasn't a lot of room for all my toiletries. They do have a few glass shelves to place things on so it makes up for it. Nice bathrobes for guests which I would definitely use in cooler weather. Our room was on third floor facing the street and was extremely quiet. We were there over July 4th so that certainly helped with the noise factor. They have coffee available in the lobby in the morning and fresh citrus water during the day that I looked forward to daily. It looked like it had basil leaves in it. The entire staff was friendly and warm. My only critique was our closet was very shallow. It was fine for summer clothing but would have never fit winter clothing in it. If you are going in cooler weather and need to bring boots, coats, etc, just ask for a room with a bigger closet.

The Iroquois was the most traditional and charming and probably the nicest hotel I have tried in NYC. I got a good rate, on a Sunday night.The Iroguois is located in midtown, one block from Times Square and between 5th and 6th Avenue (Av. of the Americas). So it's well located for shopping and access by bus or subway to most places in Manhattan. When you walk into the lobby it feels like an oasis in midtown. Reception staff are nice and helpful. The very pleasant lobby has free refreshments at various times, fruit or iced lemon water. Off the lobby is a small library, with a couple of desktop computers and printers, so that you can easily print out boarding passes or reservations for your next hotel. There is also free wifi in the lobby and the rooms.My room was very small, with a window looking out to a fairly large light-well. The room was traditionally and pleasantly furnished with a good bed, small desk, good sized bathroom and a separate walk in wardrobe, that had hanging space and the safe.Unfortunately the flat screen tv didn't work on most of the channels in my room.I didn't try breakfast in the hotel, but walked up the street for a minute, past the Algonquin Hotel to a reasonably priced diner/coffee shop for breakfast.

There is a highly rated french restaurant attached to this hotel but we did not get to use it as they are closed on Sundays. Room service to a limited degree is still available on Sundays. The one and only problem we had with this hotel was the street noise. If you have a room over the street expect to hear EVERYTHING all night long. Trash truck emptying dumpsters at 3:00am, sirens, horns, people yelling, entire conversations like the people talking were right next to you. Something about the buildings along this street traps the noise and sends it upwards. We did not get any sleep as the noise levels were constant all through the night.

When I mentioned my feedback to the staff member called John, he wasnt that interested and later didnt even bother to say goodbye. Although got arrogant apologies from him.

The staff was friendly and helpful when we needed additional towels or ice (you have to request ice brought to your room, which we did about twice a day). The appeal of this hotel for me was the location and double beds. The room was small, but that is to be expected in NY. The beds were comfortable and the room/bathroom was very clean.

It is right in the middle of tourist city. You are very close to Time Square and Broadway. The streets are always busy and you will not find too many unique/ off the beaten path stores or restaraunts. The rent is too high so you will encounter a lot of chain stores.

I stayed at The Iroquois in May 2014 with my mother for a girls' weekend to pack in as many Broadway shows as we could in three days. The hotel is lovely. We had a room with two full size beds. As you'll find in most NYC hotel, the room was small but they truly did make good use of the space and I never felt cramped for space. There were some shelves added in the bathroom and a window ledge that provided enough space to set toiletries & cosmetics. My only complaint is that we had a bit of a hard time getting the dresser drawers to stay closed - it seemed that the dresser was slightly tilted forward so you had to make sure the drawer was stuck in place or else it would just slide back out. I'm sure this was an issue just with the particular room we stayed in. Though there were not coffee makers in the room, the hotel had coffee service in the lobby each morning and a particular national coffee chain has 3 shops within about a 2 block radius. The hotel also offered infused water later in the day which was so nice to have if we were stopping in to change or drop off bags in between sightseeing and shows. All of the agents and other employees we interacted with were professional and courteous.

Walk down Fifth Avenue one way for Rockefeller, and the other way for Empire State, Macy's and the Chrysler Building. Grand Central is nearby and you can get the big red tour bus (recommended!) from Times Square, a ten minute stroll away. For the keener walker, Central Park is not too far up Fifth Avenue, and for the very keen (us!) you could walk right down to the very tip of Manhattan - but better to get the bus or subway! Restaurants all round, a great traditional diner next door but one (Red Flame Diner) and plenty of places for coffee/dinner.

In a word, we felt genuinely welcome. We booked a deluxe room, which I think means it is a corner room with a slightly bigger floor plan and two windows. Our room was very slightly tight, as you often find in these older buildings. I don't really take that as a negative, just part of the deal. Our room was impeccably clean, with very nice linens, towels, a wonderful king mattress and superb quality feather pillows. The bathroom was generously sized, and completely tiled in marble. The bathroom could use a bit of a freshening up, as it was decorated with gold accents which do not feel terribly contemporary, and these fittings were also showing their age. A small quibble. High points: Really wonderful staff, very comfortable room, lovely charming old historic building. Also you must try The Lantern's Keep, the on-site ""speakeasy"" bar. Absolutely amazing cocktails.Less high point: I found the street noise a bit annoying. I have stayed in NY on a number of occasions and the big city noise is always present. Having the room on the front of a nearly 120 year old building meant the noise at night was a little more present. This is one of those ""it is what it is"" things, certainly not a deal-breaker, but if you are sensitive to street noise, perhaps pack some earplugs.","Deshaies, Guadeloupe","Ritchard F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Deshaies, Guadeloupe</strong>",77,4.0

Personnel, Value, Bedding, Classic old-style personal attention to one's comfort. Much prefer it to the anonymity of the Hiltons or MariottCons: Eliminate source of banging at night near back rooms.Location: Heart of theater district. Easy walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center attractions and restaurants.The Iroquois is what one expects from a sophisticated hotel in Manhattan: stylish, classic, chic details like the library with free computer access and good natural light to read by. The service is warm without being overly familiar. More Mrs. Hughes than Thomas. The comfy bedding invites snuggling down and lingering past the alarm. Nice to have gratis tangerines instead of the ubiquitous apple at the front desk and the complimentary coffee in the lobby is perfect when one must grab a few quick gulps on the run. Only slight annoyance was some banging around in the back of the building - or was it the floor below? that woke us up a couple of times in the night. A higher floor might eliminate that distraction. (We were on 2). The Iroquois enjoys a fabulous location so near the theaters and restaurants we only had to walk a very few blocks and this was most appreciated in the freezing weather. Hotel personnel are the stars of this place and the custom liqueur Brandy Alexander nightcaps in their Speak-Easy era bar are a guilty pleasure as well.

Another friend had recommended the Iroquois. The hotel was PERFECT! Great location just a few blocks off of Times Square. We were within walking distance of both venues at which we saw plays. We were also walking distance to Rockefeller Center, the NYC Public Library, Grand Central Station, 5th Avenue shopping, and plenty of restaurants. Besides feeling so ""in the middle of things,"" the hotel was remarkably quiet. We had nothing disturb our sleep.The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Our room was tiny, but quaint and very clean. The beds were not as comfortable as I would expect in a small, boutique hotel such as this but the linens were amazing. The room was stocked with all of the necessary toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap, body wash, lotion) as well as ironing board with iron, hair dryer and bath robes. The hotel gets a big KUDOS for having a lighted magnifying mirror!! As anyone who has read my other reviews knows, this is a BIG plus as I feel it is an item all hotels, no matter what star level, should provide as it is a necessary grooming tool.My only complaint, and this one is soooo minor, is the hotel uses those pressure sensitive trays for the room's minibar. The minibar is a nice touch but, given that it was on the dresser where clothes were stored, items can easily be bumped and all of the sudden you have a room charge. In fact, I had a charge for a soda show up on my bill and I believe this is why. There is a sign on the dresser warning you, but that really isn't sufficient. I understand why the pressure sensitive trays are so nice for the hotel, but it seems there should be an easier method. Why can't there be a case or something where you have to use a credit card swipe to open it, or a special code given to you upon check-in? Then there's no mistaking your intentions. Anyway, I digress. I do have to say that the staff took care of the removing the charge from my bill without question.I highly recommend The Iroquois for your NYC stay, especially if you will be hanging around the Times Square area for most of your trip. We did not take the subway at all during our short weekend so I cannot say much about access to subway stations. Taxi cabs were easy to obtain on Sunday morning for our return flight and we were at the airport in about 25 minutes.When I return to NYC I will definitely be staying at The Iroquois again!","St. Louis, MO","Lateralbee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Louis, MO</strong>",59,5.0

And I received some unexpectedly stellar customer service, which I'll get to in a minute. But first, a summary of the hotel experience: it is everything you want in a hotel. The entire staff is professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. We chose an upgraded room this time and it included a proper bathtub, which is quite the luxury for a Manhattan hotel room.The bed was super comfy and luxurious; lots of pillows, which I love. The room was quiet and the lighting was subtle. They offer turn down service in the evenings, leaving chocolate and a weather card on your pillow. Such a nice touch. In the mornings the lobby serves good, strong coffee and in the afternoon they switch to hot cider; so nice to come back to after walking through bustling Times Square. Which brings me to location: The Iroquois is very centrally located, just two blocks away from Times Square and steps away from the theatres where we were seeing Broadway shows. Just perfect. And now to that bit about customer service that went above and beyond: we had booked our room during a mega Boxing Week sale, pre-paid and non-refundable terms. When I informed the front desk that we'd unexpectedly be leaving early (due to a health issue, which I didn't tell them), they offered me a refund, which was totally unexpected. I couldn't believe that they did this even though I didn't ask them to.

We didn't eat at the hotel so no comments there. We did aim for the bar on our first night but it was fully reserved. We were a little disappointed with this. My advice is to make a reservation at check in. It is a very small bar. We reserved a table another evening when the bar was quieter. The creativity of the bar tender is to be admired! The only other negative comment is about the bathroom. There is no heating in there so with marble floor and walls it can be a little chilly and also being on the 12th floor the water pressure was a little below par. I don't agree with some other comments here about the lack of hot water. There is a delay whilst hot water arrives, but only about 30 seconds so no a problem really. Overall, a very enjoyable 4 nights. Lasting impression? Staff. Exceptional.","London, United Kingdom","mgarn33</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",174,5.0

It would struggle to be anywhere better.The rooms are very clean with extremely comfortable bedding and a well appointed bathroom. Robes are included.The deluxe room didn't feel small but certainly didn't feel big either. The room we were allocated was on the 4th floor and suffered from noise from an adjacent engineering room. We were moved as soon as this was mentioned to a quieter room on the 11th floor (with a view of the Chrysler Building). You could still hear the New York hum of air rooftop air conditioning units but it was by no means intrusive. There was no noise from other rooms.We were let down by the concierge (or the Lantern's Keep bar - not sure which) when a booking for the Keep wasn't actioned. However, fortunately space became available and we were accommodated. In essence the keep is a room that sells cocktails, not as poetic as the descriptions suggest, but nice enough.Staff were polite and all in all we had a very pleasant stay in a hotel that felt nice.

The room was fine but five minutes after I had unpacked, I heard a loud noisy vibration. I went into the hallway to see where the noise was coming from and traced it to the stairwell beside the elevator. A housekeeping staff member greeted me and agreed with me that the noise was loud and said that it was the air conditioner and that she would mention it to the hotel engineer to have it fixed. As I had an appointment I thought nothing more of it and ran out. When I returned to sleep that evening, to my dismay, the vibration continued on and off throughout the night giving me a fairly sleepless night. I mentioned it to the front desk clerk in the morning and she quickly and graciously offered to change my room which she did, but not before mentioning that had I asked the night before, which luckily I hadn't, she wouldn't have been able to change my room as the hotel was sold out.The inconvenience of having to repack and unpack was worth it to get a good night's sleep, however I couldn't help but feel that my experience has been devalued by this and in the future I might think twice before returning.

The Iroquois was a pretty decent, clean hotel. All of their staff was friendly, hotel rooms and bathrooms were clean; however, our ""premium"" king deluxe was small, very dark and hot. Although there were two windows, there was no view...just emergency stairs and a brick wall. By far it was not the worst hotel experience, but a room with a comfortable temperature would have been very nice. When I called to front desk about the temperature they sent a very nice gentleman to open our room window. Thanks, I guess!! Their gym is also small, with limited workout equipment. At greater than $300 per night, I would expect that I would not have to sleep in a room with an open window to keep cool. This was very disappointing, as was the fact that the restaurant and the bar were closed in honor of Yom Kippur. No biggie, but it would have been great to follow our original plans and have a nice dinner in the restaurant that I've heard so many wonderful things about. For travelers that are looking for a decent hotel that is close to Times Square and Broadway shows, the Iroquois may be the ideal location...just do not expect an abundance of space, room controlled temperature, a fantastic view, or luxury!","Washington DC, District of Columbia","FrequentTraveler1973</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",2,3.0

My husband never travels without a couple pairs of earplugs and we both needed them. However, that's my only complaint about the hotel. The beds were very comfortable, the linens, towels and toiletries top quality. I appreciate the free wifi, which should be standard in any 3 or 4 star hotel but isn't in NYC.

I used to work at the Rolex Tower, one week a month from Toronto and, on business, would stay at the St. Regis. I confess to have been badly spoiled. On personal trips over the last few years, I have travelled without an expense account and stayed at various hotels in Midtown; however, none has been entirely desirable ... until now! I received a notice from Asia Miles that Small Luxury Hotels have joined the awards program. There was an introductory offer that included bonus miles plus a first-time upgrade. Decided to give it a try at The Iroquois.What a terrific find! Located on 44th West, between 5th and 6th, it is within a five-minute walk of Times Square, the Theatre District, The Avenue, and shopping on 5th. Our room on the 9th floor faced to the back of the hotel and was wonderfully quiet. We went out daily, from 8 am to Midnight, so view was not important; not hearing the garbage trucks all night was most appreciated.Lovely Frette Italian linens, Moulton Brown comestibles, deliciously comfortable beds with big puffy duvets and deep pillows, evening turndown service, morning newspaper. Non smoking room was fastidiously clean and odour-free. Complimentary morning coffee in the lobby, to take into the front lounge, and enjoy with the newspaper. Computers available; there is also free wifi throughout the hotel. Lovely front desk, door and concierge staff.We were not able to get a complimentary upgrade for two separate beds (two doubles in a room are the maximum size available); instead, we were gifted with a bottle of wine and a box of truffles.This hotel is in a ""vintage"" row with most buildings dating back to the late 1800s. There are historic plaques on the building fronts that provide architectural details. Also, the street was home to the literati (playwrights, critics, writers, actors and social gossips) of the 1920's: Hemingway, Faulkner, the Marx Brothers. Fascinating history.New York has become quite an expensive city in the past five years, even more so than London and Paris. The Iroquois is comparable in price to the Hilton Garden Chelsea but oozes charm, class and amenities far beyond.We'll be back at the first possible opportunity!

Nice fluffy towels and gowns (had to request slippers), Molton Brown toiletries, a 'proper' hairdryer, and very quiet despite being on 44th...however I get irritated beyond belief by hotels that don't supply tea / coffee in the room. Why? You get an iron - give me a kettle! I don't always want to ring for room service just to get a cuppa!

A beautiful old gem for a decent value.Location:The hotel is quite close to both Penn Station and Grand Central. Just a short walk to Bryant Park, Times Square and Rockefeller Center and just a little longer walk to Museum Row, The Park and Madison Ave. This location is also very close to Broadway. For a typical tourist it's nearly a perfect location. However my personal opinion varies a bit. I've been to Manhattan a lot. Midtown no longer does it for me. In fact my belief is that nothing differs from ""real"" New York City more than Manhattan. I prefer Brooklyn or one of the villages. This opinion however does not effect my rating.Rating: 4 StarsAppearance/Condition:The building is roughly 113 years old. It's a gem that has been restored beautifully. The street is clean and the condition of the building is very good. The lobby is classic and clean. It reflects the style of the building in its heyday and is in very good condition. The elevators are a bit small, slow and old, but it is not an issue.Rating: 4 StarsService/Check in:Efficient, polite and without issues. A new person was being trained and she did very well. No issues here. They referred to me by name and gave me a welcome packet.Rating: 5 StarsRoom:Small but comfortable. Nicely furnished although a bit dark. The one window in the room opened up to basically a small shaft in the center core of the building. No biggie because when one is in New York one shouldn't be spending time in the hotel room. The only problem I had with the room was the AC was REALLY loud (so were people int he hallway from time to time...don't people know to be quiet?) as was the mini-bar and the fridge we had put into the room. We didn't get any exterior noise however. The room has a mini-bar (don't touch anything or you'll be billed) but they will bring up a fridge upon request.Rating: 4 StarsBed:I rate the bed separately, since a great room can have an awful bed and an awful room can have a great bed.

While all boutique hotels claim to specialise in personalised service, stylish decor, great dining and a unique atmosphere, the Iroquois is one of the few that actually gets all of these things right. I had been to New York before and as the hotel is right in Midtown I was expecting a tiny room with limited amenities. Boy was I wrong! We were upgraded from our King Premier room to a suite which was double-the-size of an already good-sized room. The suite included a large living room with two couches, TV, bar and desk and a bedroom with King-size bed and bathroom with separate shower and bathtub. The bed was well appointed with large, squashy pillows and pillow-top mattress akin to the ultra-comfy beds one finds at 5-star hotels. Bathroom amenities included Molton Brown accessories and nice quality towels. Beyond the physical size of the room, I was impressed by the quality of the design. This is what a boutique hotel should be. Both the living room and bedroom had giant floor to ceiling windows and warm coloured tones in the furniture, window dressing and bed dressing. The couches, bed, and seats were all very comfortable. It was a wonderful cozy feeling to return to after a day of pounding the pavement sight-seeing in New York and considering the size, it felt incredibly luxurious and indulgent considering we were in the heart of Manhattan. In addition to the room, I was very impressed with the service. One measure I always use for service in a hotel is whether all of the staff great you when passing (including housekeeping and doormen). The Iroquois certainly passed that test. Of course, evening turndown service is provided and doormen were quick to offer umbrellas when it rained. I must single out Vanessa, the concierge as superb and one of the finest and most efficient concierges I've experienced. Her Mexican restaurant recommendation was spot on and she never had to rely on books or maps to help us along the way. She is a true asset to the hotel and compliments its fine style and rooms. One other surprise, was the quality of the dining. I'm not usually one for dining in hotel restaurants, but we looked up reviews of the Iroquois' French restaurant and they were very favourable, so on our first night we decided to give it a try. Again, excellent service and superb food all round. The bar too, has great reviews and was packed each night such that we didn't even try to go down for a night cap. Usually, in these small hotels, the dining and bar is seen as an after thought, but not at the Iroquois!And finally, the location right in Mid-town is ideal for any tourists to the city. Located along a street lined with the private clubs of Ivy League universities, the Iroquois is a short walk from Times Square (and all the key subway lines), Broadway shows, Grand Central Station, Union Square, 5th Avenue Shopping and Central Park.All in all, the Iroquois has to be one of my favorite surprise hotel finds on my travels. Very few properties can tick all the boxes from room, decor, service, dining and location but the Iroquois does it. Further, to find such a hotel where the atmosphere is so warm and service oriented in mid-town was a welcome surprise. I loved my stay here and could not find a single fault. I would not hesitate to return when I am next in New York and recommend it whole-heartedly for anyone looking for some luxury, great service and warm atmosphere in Midtown.",South Pole,"Tanagan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Pole</strong>",109,5.0

All the staff were very friendly and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble for them. We rang down almost every night for a bucket of ice and within minutes, a large bucket was ready for us at out room. The hotel also offers a DVD library service. There are nearly 200 films to choose from. It was great because they are free and handy especially if you like to watch the tv before you go out in the morning or before you go to bed a night. Vanessa (the concierge) was also great. If we told her where we wanted to go that day, she would plan it out, tell us the best way to get there and arrange any tickets needed for the attractions. She also convinced us to get the New York Subway which we thought would be complicated when in fact it was quite straight forward. The room we stayed in was The 'Superior Two Double Beds'. This room was located on the fourth floor and was lovely. Very quiet, however it was a little bit dark because of lack of lighting and the bathroom was a little bit on the small side.

We had never been to NY before and wanted to see as many of the sights as possible whilst there. The problem was; which hotel and where in NY should we book? So I turned to Trip Advisor for help. Eventually I settled on 'The Iroquois'. The choice proved well founded. The Iroquois is perfectly located; approximately 5 minutes walk from Times Square and 15-20 minutes walk from both Central Park and the Empire State Building. The hotel staff were very welcoming on our late (1am) arrival and when we awoke the next morning we experienced our only, very slight, grumble. Due to the surrounding high rise buildings, there was no natural light in the room and it was necessary to have the lights on all the time. However this is the only very petty grumble and certainly never detracted from the rest of the plusses of the hotel which included: free wifi throughout the hotel, a free daily newspaper delivered to the room, free coffee in the morning and free cold fruit water in the afternoon; available in the lobby. Unfortunately we never slept too well the first 2 nights; this was due (in our opinion) to a far too soft mattress. We therefore asked at reception if it might be possible to change it? The reception staff were most helpful and said they would speak to maintenance to see if anything could be done. That night and the rest of our stay was spent in perfect slumber!! This incident was typical of all of the staff throughout the hotel, who we found to be very friendly and helpful. For first time visitors to New York; 'The Iroquois' is perfectly located. It has great facilities with friendly helpful staff. For returning visitors to New York; you would struggle to find a better value for money hotel and my wife and I would highly recommend it.","Bristol, United Kingdom","476GaryK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, United Kingdom</strong>",23,5.0

Rooms are well presented, have high end finishes, quality towels and toiletries and the beds are the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The housekeeping team do a great job maintaining the standards set. The shower is a bit weak and room lighting a bit too soft but they are really minor points.The thing that set this hotel apart for us was the service; which was outstanding. From before we arrived both Vanessa and Mark; the hotel concierges had answered many questions via email. On arrival our room had a complimentary cheese platter, chocolates and wine as a birthday gift. Also the first restaurant we visited knew it was for a birthday and the whole experience was slick. During our stay every trip, restaurant and activity was organised from start to finish by the concierge team. They really did make sure we got the most out of our trip and experienced the some of the best restaurants in New York. They were both excellent and we were greatly appreciative of their assistance!The whole team at the hotel were professional, reception was a great first impression of the hotel; always friendly and efficient they would make sure they spoke to you whenever you were in their vicinity. John the porter was knowledgeable on our arrival and Bill who we often saw on the door was a really cool character- always chipper and really friendly.Great stay, excellent service, thoroughly recommend this hotel.","Rainhill, United Kingdom","NeilA85</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rainhill, United Kingdom</strong>",7,5.0

I love places with a history, so this was right up my alley.The Iroquois is located just two blocks from Times Square, the NY library and Grand Central Terminal, but it is on a quiet block. The hotel itself is very sedate with only about 8 or 10 rooms to a floor so you don't get foot traffic past your door all night long. Although our room backed up to the elevator shaft, we could not hear the elevator at all.The staff is very gracious and helpful, athough we really didn't avail ourselves of their services too much. From a service standpoint, everything went as it should have.The room itself was very pleasant. Of course, this is New York, so it was not spacious, but we did not expect it to be. It did have ample space, a good closet, desk, king bed, quality flat screen TV and a very spacious marble bathrooom. There were two large windows in the main room, plus two windoews in the bathroom. Considering there was no view to the street, the room was very bright. Except for Sunday, there was an NY Times on our door every morning.There is a small restaurant and separate bar downstairs. We had dessert in the restaurant one night after a show and it was nice. The kitchen does close at 11 and we barely made it. One night we had a drink in the bar, Lantern's Keep. I must say the bartender was very entertaining as the bar specializes on cocktails using fresh juices and homemade syrups. We probably did not need that last drink, but it was fun and we were just staying upstairs.There is a cool little library sitting area off the lobby of the hotel. Overall, I think we have found our quiet place in the city.","Dallas, Texas","PaulP117</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",134,5.0

I arrived before a room was ready so I darted off to find lunch...the concierge recommended the Burger Joint which is a hole in the wall dive burger place behind a curtain in the lobby of the Le Parker Meridian hotel. Seriously random and a GREAT suggestion. After lunch, I came back and they had upgraded my room to a king...nice of them. It had zero view but when I am in Manhatten, I spend no time in my room and all my time out in the city in meetings. The bed was great, the room was SILENT (never happens in NYC) and it had the best shower I've experienced in the city. Tons of water and water pressure, very hot water and a drain that actually works well. The towels were huge and super absorbant. The staff was helpful and courteous. The whole stay went without a hitch. Great location, great staff, great amenities, etc. I would give it 5 stars but like all rooms in NYC, it is smallish and expensive.

We had a meeting to attend on 44th Street which prompted the initial selection. Now that we have stayed here, we will be happy to stay here again. We were asked upon check-in whether we wanted a room with a lot of sun, or a 'complimentary upgrade' to a room on a low floor. We took the upgrade. I don't know the other rooms to know how it compared. The room we were assigned was in the back with a view of the light shaft -- in other words: no view. We loved it. Why? It was very quiet, and quiet means good sleeping. No noise from the outside and none either from the inside.As others have said the rooms are not large, but very clean. The staff was attentive. The bellhop helped unload the car and ensured that I parked in a good lot and got the hotel discount. Parking is not cheap in NYC. But the cost was not as bad as expected ($140 for the four days.) The desk worked with us on room preferences as previously described and the maid service was also good.This is not a place to stay for a once in a lifetime 5 star experience. But most of us, most of the time do not need or want to pay for that treatment. What do I mean by 5-star? I use the Milestone Hotel in London as my gauge.

A tall terraced building which was tasefully decorated with dark mahogany classic hotel furniture , and really comfy beds. Very clean and had everything you need with loads of towels, molton brown toiletries. There were nice touches, like the linen was changed every day including beds, which wasn't really necessary but nice. , chocolate left on pillow etc. All staff were very helpful and very courteous, the concierge booked us a table at Birdland Jazz club (which is only a 10 minute walk) and we had a table in front of the stage. Breakfast was not provided, although there is a restaurant attached to the hotel which serves breakfast, we just chose to go out for breakfast as there are bakeries and cafes close by. Complimentary coffee is available in the hotel foyer, as there are not tea and coffee facilities in the room.It would have been nice to have a lounge in the hotel...there is just a little library area which has armchairs, but it is only small. Other than this, I can't fault the hotel. its also right next to 5th avenue, so ideal for shopping, ..within walking distance of Rockefeller Center, tiffanys, Saks fifth avenue, etc...Some good restaurants and bars on 44th street itself.The Empire state building, times square, central park, central station, the flatiron building are all within walking distance, and bryant square, just round the corner from the hotel is a lovely area for lunch outside and people watching.I would say not to bother with the skyride if visiting the empire state, as it adds a bit to the cost and is not anything special.the subway is really cheap and easy to use...you can travel anywhere in the city for $2.50. The transfer link airport taxi service takes about 1 hour 30 mins, so allow plenty of time for your return to the airport especially during rush hour as traffic can be really slow.Allow for plenty of spare change for tips as it is expected by doormen, cab drivers, waiters etc (except if there are more than five of you in a group).Staten island ferry is a good way to see the statue of liberty as it goes past her, so good for photos. The ferry is free. Katz's deli is an authentic u.s. deli and a good way to get the real deli experience, (it is where they filmed the famous deli scene from When Harry Met Sally), but it is always very busy, so be prepared for it being a bit chaotic.Madison Square Garden is withing walking distance of the hotel, approx. 25 mins. , and really well organized when seeing a gig there..its massive, but the flow of people in and out to get seated etc, is really quick and efficient.",San Antonio Ibiza,"kay_matterson</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio Ibiza</strong>",2,4.0

The location is truly great- right next to fifth avenue and a moment from grand central and Times Square, Rockerfeller centre, moma, New York City library and loads of up town shopping options. Also walking distance to numerous subway lines so you really can get anywhere within Manhattan in about 20 minutes, or less, and its convenient on the subway for Brooklyn too. Although its in a lively part of town, 44th street is actually not too busy and we only had a gentle purr of the inevitable air com to lull us to sleep. No sound from other rooms or the corridor which is great. We did not try the restaurant but it has rave reviews and it did look really cosy and atmospheric, buzzing and full on all our 4 nights. There is a spa and gym as well. The room was fine, very clean, and the beds were fabulously comfy. It was good- just not sure it was worth $250 plus a night. One irritating thing is that there are no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, although there is free coffee in the lobby all day- a nice touch. And no breakfast included in our deal, not that unusual for NY. There are lots of mid town restaurants and cafes near by. I suppose overall I sort of wished I had booked a cheaper place in a more interesting neighbourhood that was perhaps a bit less central, because i am not sure the location is actually worth paying so much for when manhattan is so easy to get around. Never mind- there's always next time for me. if you want a reliable option in a unbeatably central location this will definitely suit you.",London,"herbertherbert</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",18,4.0

However, for the price i paid i have been left with a bitter taste in my mouth. When I booked the room i informed them that i had just returned from fighting in Afghanistan and was wondering if i could have a room with a street view to surprise my fiancee... Instead i got a room with the WORST view i have ever had (SEE PICTURE ATTACHED-1). I needed to charge my phone in the docking station which failed to charge, upon investigation the wire was damaged and i had to spend 5 minutes fixing this problem in order to charge my phone having pulled out furniture. Once this had been resolved i turned on the TV to view Hotel information... However, i was faced with a ""Loading"" page for 3 minutes before i turned it off. So far i was very unimpressed with the first 10 minutes of being in this hotel. My Fiancee then wanted a drink of cold water from the tap but we discovered that your choice of water is either hot or warm, even after leaving the cold tap running for a while. It's a small thing that is a pain when drinking or brushing teeth. Later that night i noticed that our ""Turn Down"" hadn't been done. This was advertised on the brochure. I then called the front desk and specifically requested a turn down while i was out for the night.... THIS NEVER HAPPENED.When returning for the night i entered the shower to find black mold all around the edge of the bath it was disgusting! (SEE PICTURE-2).Once i had got clean as best as i could i went to bed to find that the headboard was 2 feet above the bed so your head rests on a lump of wood (SEE PICTURE-3). Upon trying to turn on the bedside lamp... nothing happened. It was plugged in and had two bulbs but I couldn't be bothered to fix another faulty item in this hotel. Throughout the night we were boiling hot. We had the window open but the noise of the city was too loud and upon trying to adjust the thermostat.... it did nothing and it clearly for show!! (SEE PICTURE-4).The noise of the heating system is very loud and kept us awake. However, if you do manage to get some sleep you will be woken early as when other people use the taps within the hotel; it makes a very loud whistling sound. And i mean loud enough to wake you up.The hotel offered free internet if you are able to stay connected long enough as you will find it constantly drops out and you continually have to enter a code to get back in. If you do get in it moves at the same speed a dial-up (SLOW).I would normally give this hotel a 3 star but as i was expecting more I'm afraid it needs to be a two star. For those who have given this hotel a high rating... You clearly haven't traveled as much as I have. I have visited New York City many many times and change hotel each time and I'm afraid to say.... This has to be the worst. Good Luck.","London, United Kingdom","Drury007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",41,2.0

The location, as many reviews pointed out, is fantastic-- it is easy to get anywhere-- Times Square and 5th Avenue shopping is just round the corner, there are plenty of cabs around and its a quick walk to Grand Central Station (5 minutes stroll). The complimentary hot cider in the lobby was a lovely and thoughtful touch-- just perfect for the weather!

When booking, it stated the hotel was very close to Times Square which we'd been told would be a perfect spot. The hotel was in the middle of Broadway (which would have been noisy) but was in the best place we could have asked - it was two blocks (a ten minute walk) from Broadway which was great as it meant we weren't too close to noise, butt was not too far away, all you could ask for was within walking distance.Staff:All the staff at the hotel were absolutely brilliant, really friendly and very helpful.Every morning we went to Vanessa at the concierge desk who gave us maps, directions, and recommendations for places to go such as restaurants and attractions, and always explained the easiest and cheapest way to get to these.The reception staff were also very helpful, and the doorman helped us with our bags, and flagged us taxis when we needed them.Room:The room was perfect for us, although there was a mix up where we ended up with two double beds (not that this was a problem). It was always very clean each day with fresh bed sheets and towels. The cleaner always left a cute little bag with the NY Times newspaper on the door handle each day, chocolates on our pillow, and a card with the following days weather forecast. The beds were really comfy and we had a great nights sleep. It offered a 32 inch TV, a Blu Ray player (American region DVDs only), a bath with shower function, and a long built in wardrobe.We didn't try the restaurant due to the prices being a bit high, and the mini bar was very pricey ($4 for a small diet coke) which were the only downfalls but didn't spoil anything.Overall, we were both both very satisfied with the hotel, and we would definitely come back and stay here again.","Windsor, United Kingdom","Contentbycraig</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Windsor, United Kingdom</strong>",36,4.0

This midtown hotel has a lot of things in its favour; helpful, friendly staff, well-appointed rooms, amazingly comfortable beds, and a first class cocktail bar; The Lantern’s Keep, on the ground floor. We upgraded to a corner king room which was definitely spacious by NYC standards – it was also at the back of the building so no view but no street noise either which was a bonus. Our heating failed on the penultimate day which wasn’t ideal. However, things like that can go wrong in any hotel – the real test is how staff respond. And in this case, they swiftly moved us to a suite; very comfortable if a little more susceptible to the near constant honking horns of the cabs outside. Personally speaking, The Iroquois is probably too close to Times Square for our tastes – we prefer to be within staggering distance of a bar that appeals to locals as well as tourists – but for other people, this may well be a major selling point. It was certainly convenient for Broadway, Rockerfeller Centre and most other ‘must see’ nyc spots.There’s a decent diner practically next door which was great for breakfast and a coffee shop opposite. Hell’s Kitchen was a 10 minute walk away and good for casual dinner options – (we enjoyed Southern Hospitality & 5 Napkin Burger) and for a rough and ready bar with a great jukebox Rudy’s is definitely worth a visit. Overall, for us The Iroquois delivered; it’s a classy joint with attentive staff and we’d definitely consider going back.","Manchester, United Kingdom","SR73</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",32,4.0

While the bath included a separate spa tub and small tile shower, there is no counter space whatsoever. We did enjoy the third floor gym and sauna as well as the convenience of the library computer with printer in the lobby.

The entry is bright and clearly marked but the outer doors looked like one has a damaged hinge, making the entrance look a little less appealing. I hauled my bags up the entrance stairs and through the outer entry doors. Once I passed through the outer door and began to open the inner door, the doorman reached over and opened the door. Given the hour and that the doorman was right there as I opened the lobby door, it begs the conclusion that the doorman was standing there the whole time and decided not to leave the warm lobby to come outside and help me drag my bags up the stairs. To make matters worse, there was a double layer of mats right inside the door and I nearly fell as I tripped over the top mat and lost my grip on the bags. Now, I was disgusted by the questionable doorman service and wondering if my laptop was busted. Fortunately, the person at reception was pleasant and quickly checked me in. The ride up the elevator was a little unsettling; it's one of those old, springy-feeling elevators. My room has been the best part of my experience- it is clean, has decent fixtures, nice toiletries and linens. I would recommend this hotel because it's a clean hotel in a good location at a good price but if you don't want to deal with stairs at the entry (I did not ask how they accomodate folks who cannot walk stairs) and if you like to have your arrival experience just so, you might consider looking elsewhere for accomodations.","Seattle, Washington","Renee C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",7,4.0

We had twin room with two double beds. The room was very small, dark and cluttered. Every available surface was covered in hotel booklets and minibar items. The sill in front of the small window that let in very little light was the only clear space in the room. The hotel seems to have taken the need to economise to the extremes. There were no light fittings on the walls or ceiling of the room, no fridge, no coffee maker, teabags or kettle. One can only begin to guess how much they are saving on the power bill! The room was lit with 1 small table lamp and 1 lamp on a stand. It was next to impossible to see into the wardrobe to find things in your suitcase and no room to store the case any where but in the robe.If you want coffee you need go down to the foyer and help yourself from a small silver urn. Coffee is only available for a limited time in the morning. The foyer is also very dimly lit.The bathroom was small and narrow (about 115cm wide) and icy cold.On the positive side, the staff were polite and helpful and the hotel is centrally located within easy walking distance of Broadway, Times Square, the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Centre, and several subway stations that make it easy to get to Central Park, Ground Zero, the ferry to the Statue of Liberty and numerous shops and museums.","Brisbane, Australia","Justmeplease</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",175,3.0

A stranger did it for me! Once checked in, an employee decided to show me to the room with me trailing along with my luggage and holding the door to the elevator for him. I finally told him to take the luggage. Once in the room I was told that I was not allowed to adjust the temperature of the room on the thermostat. When I asked about the window heating/AC unit, he proceeded to fiddle with it. I told him to be sure that it was off. He lied and said it was off. It was not off. I later had to get the engineer to turn it completely off as the prior employee had activated a timer that was cycling it on and off. There is no lighting in the closet or for that whole end of the room where I was attempting to unpack. I took the minimum out of my bag for fear of losing the other things in the dark. All wall plugs are completely filled with the hotel's stuff. I had to get down on my hands and knees to find a strip plug underneath the desk for my IPad to charge. Then I found an outlet on the side of the desk for my IPhone to charge. However, to my dismay the next morning I found that when I turned off the desk light, the desk plug also went dead and my phone did NOT charge overnight. The mattress was good and that is why this hotel received three stars instead of two. Now, the shower: I scalded my right arm turning off the shower because there are absolutely NO markings on the shower as where hot, cold or off is. I recommend that you step outside the tub/shower before turning it off and be sure not to have any part of you under the water when turning it off. There is no ventilation in the bathroom. Therefore, not only was the bathroom completely steamed, which ruined my hair, but also the bedroom windows. As to the so-called BAY window in my room: The top half of the windows is completely blacked out by the hotel eliminating half the light coming in the windows. And this room really needs more light. In addition, there are dark brown wooden shutters that cannot be lifted, only tilted that further curtail light entering this room. What a dismal swamp it is. Breakfast: there was an argument about whether or not I was allowed to order the continental breakfast, being first told no and later told yes. And then there was the issue with the eggs. Even when I told them how many minutes to boil the eggs, the cook could not do the eggs even half way cooked to wear I asked. Not a good situation, in my opinion. Sleeping: Although the mattress was comfortable, I had to wear earplugs and play a sound soother to sleep well. When the neighboring room turned on its shower, the water sound screamed and bubbled right at the headboard to my bed. I checked out in the AM for a conference, stored my luggage at the hotel and was allowed to use the gym in the late PM to change my shoes for my trip home in the early evening. I am attempting to be fair and point out the good, too. And finally, when I noted some of the deficiencies to the person who originally escorted me to my room his answer was: ""It is What it is."" Now that I am safely at home, I can laugh at this most ridiculous interpretation of customer service I have ever heard.","Cockeysville, Maryland","9Adventuress</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cockeysville, Maryland</strong>",49,3.0

I chose it because of it's location to Times Square & 5th Avenue and because it also got good reviews here. The staff were very professional and always had a smile. The room was clean and cozy. Our suite, #1000, had the most amazing view of Rockefeller Centre. Also, the windows open nice and wide, which was good because the hotel has that stuffy old hotel air, which gives it its charm but also makes it hard to sleep at night. Of course opening the window makes it louder than normal; I brought earplugs. If you are a light sleeper, BRING earplugs to New York! My husband thought the room was a little small but I thought it was just right. When your on a quick 4 day'er, you don't spend any time in it anyway. It had a TV, dresser draws, a little fridge, a good sized bathtub shower and a desk with chair. Pretty standard. Unfortunately, we did not eat in the hotel restaurant but a lady in the elevator told me that it was great. Within a 5 block radius there are plenty of restaurants and Irish Pubs (which happen to be my favourite!), so the hotel ammendities were not that important to me on this trip. There is a good, reasonably priced, family style restaurant at the end of the block called ""the red flame"". Great breakfast diner restaurant for it's price. As I mentioned, the hotel is close to everything. Don't kid yourself though, if you are in New York to see the sights, you will be walking alot. Bring good shoes.

We were going to highly recommend this hotel before the storm - and afterwards we can only say thank goodness we stayed at this total gem in Midtown.Staff are fabulous, rooms are very comfortable (King has much more room and better large bed than standard room so recommend king rooms). No noise from lifts or other rooms despite hotel being full. Its not trendy - its conservative and a little old fashioned but in a good comfortable way with great linen and bathrooms as well.The location is great - two blocks to the madness of Time Square and then you can retreat to this haven - or walk the other direction straight onto the shopping mecca of 5th avenue. 10 minute walk to Empire State. Breakfast in the hotel's restaurant ""Triomphe"" is too formal/staid and pricey for us but it was very good food. We had our stay extended by Superstorm Sandy and I can honestly say in 20 years of travrelling the globe we have never experienced such service and dedication as the staff showed its guests during this crisis. The morning after the storm when Manhattan was closed down literally and shut off from the rest of NYC, the hotel laid on complimentary breakfast for all guests, they provided up to the minute information from airlines about flight cancellations, they made pots of coffee for guests in the lobby trying to use the internet, and despite having to sleep at work, the doormen handed out umbrellas with a smile and up to date information about what was operating or open when it was hard to find places to eat.We must mention the fabulous and friendly concierge Vanessa who was always smiling and knowledgable and sorted out anything guests asked her to including spending over an hour on the phone (helping other customers whilst she was on hold I might add!) to an airline for us trying to change our flights due to cancellations. Patrick on the front desk kept his cool when faced with tired and emotional customers and was always helpful. Hotel management did the human spirited thing and made the very generous decision to allow all guests to stay on at a flat rate which was below their usual rate (unlike other operational hotels in NYC after the storm) and also to cancel additional nights up until 2pm if guests found they could actually travel out of NYC.AMAZING.

Thoughts :-great location. On W44th between 5th and 6th, a couple of blocks from Grand Central Station and a few mins walk from Times Square, but W44th is not the noisiest street so good from that perspective-boutique feel. It's small in NYC hotel terms, and perhaps lacks some of the facilities as a result, but is also friendlier than many. Staff are great.-the room I had was inward facing and had no view at all (a wall obscured part of the window - could not even tell what the weather was like - seriously). However, this also meant the room was quiet - not always the case in NYC-room was pretty small. Was fine for me travelling solo but would've been cramped if shared. I don't know if this was typical of rooms in the hotel but I suspect it was-room was otherwise v nice. Quality fittings, nice linen, new-looking bathroom with good shower and Molton Brown toiletries, with a small desk and HD TV and a mini bar in the room-wifi is free in this hotel which isn't all that common in NYC - could save you $20/day-room service menu is very limited, although food (from Triomphe, the French Restaurant at Ground Level) is of good quality and the service was quick when I ordered. First room service menu I've seen that had no club sandwich and no fries !-the hotel has a tiny gym and sauna. The gym, although v small, has enough kit in decent condition for a sensible workout and it was unusual to see anyone else in there-I didn't visit the bar but it looked lively and has a good reputation for cocktails and atmosphere-free coffee in the lobbyPerfectly nice place to stay for a few days on business and very conveniently located, but room size, gym size and limitations of room service menu means I'll probably revert to my preferred hotel next time, although I wouldn't mind staying here again.

Times Square was two blocks away, all the main theatres were 2-4 blocks away, and major subway stops were also only a couple of blocks at most. And because of it's nearness to the theatre district, you had a plethora of restaurants to chose from.The hotel itself was immaculate and in a very safe area, surrounded by other botique hotels, restaurants, and nice bars - always felt safe. The rooms were large enough, for NYC, and the ammenites were great - other than the fact that you had to call for ice; no ice machines. Be sure and check out the Tavern's Keep cocktail bar on the first floor - they serve 1800-1920s era classic cocktails, with top notch ingredients and great presentation.The front desk staff was good enough, but Vanessa, the Chief Concierge was fabulous. She took care of all of the tasks I needed done in advance - arranging car service for us from Newark, getting a reservation at one of the finest restaurants in NYC for our anniversary, printing out Empire State Building tickets, etc. She even took care of a complimentary bottle of wine and chocolates for our anniversary - very nice.The combination of location of the hotel, cleanliness and ammenities, and professionalism of staff made The Iroquois Hotel the perfect choice. I would not hesitate to stay there again, and Vanessa helped us make our 25th wedding anniversary a VERY special occassion.","Seattle, WA","LanceinNW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, WA</strong>",15,5.0

We found the room to be small, but adequate for our needs - how much time do you spend there anyways - you are in New York City. The room did not have a fridge, but you can request one. The staff was friendly and helpful - ice arrived promptly when requested. It was July and the air conditioning worked perfectly. We were out and about from early morning to later in the day and did not use the hotels amenities, but heard from other guests that the restaurant was lovely. The location was just around the corner from Times Square, but noise was not an issue. We enjoyed the five nights we stayed at The Iroquois and we would definitely stay there again on our next trip to New York.","Victoria, Canada","Inge57</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Canada</strong>",18,4.0

(44th between 5th and 6th ave).As such it is ideally situated for Grand Central and the Theatre District.If you don't mind the walk, Central Park is not too far and hardcore shoppers will go crazy for the number of high end stores around this area (Macy's is 10 blocks south and 2 avenues over).We however, found that many of the places we wanted to visit, required a short cab ride (Chelsea, West Village, Lincoln Center). Cabs are easy to get and inexpensive - plus you can pay by card at no extra charge these days.If you are looking for a relaxing slice of NY life, this area is to be avoided. If you enjoy hustle and bustle - the centre of the action is right here. Bear this in mind when choosing a room in the hotel - if you are at the front of the building, you need to be high up.We stayed in two different rooms. The first room was a classic room with 2 double beds in the middle of the hotel on the 4th floor - it had views of a burnt out building and (because of the buildings shape) also afforded an excellent view into a neighbouring guests' room.This room had a small thin bathroom and a strange bath/shower arrangement with sliding doors and this made it difficult to get in and out. The decor however, was extremely nice. We extended our stay and moved to a Suite at the front of the hotel on the 8th floor. This consisted of a lounge with two sofas, a desk and two armchairs, a chest of drawers, some tables and a large TV plus mini fridge. Then a bedroom with a US King / UK superking bed, plus an armchair with footstool, a chaise long style bench, a chest of drawers, a couple of tables and another large TV. Also a very thin closet. The bedroom leads onto a beautifully decorated bathroom with a separate show and jacuzzi bath and lots of towels plus robes.We loved the mattress and linens in both of the bedrooms we stayed in. I will be investigating purchasing the mattress for our new house.One major drawback for us, was the low lighting levels in both of these rooms. At some point in the past, the hotel decided to remove the central light fixture from each room, leaving beautiful but somewhat impractical mood lighting as the only light source (lamps, picture spots etc). At times we even turned the TV on to provide more lighting! In our first room, we asked for an extra lamp - which was some help but I believe they use low wattage/energy saving bulbs, so not a complete solution.The service in this hotel was excellent. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly and resourceful staff. This was particularly helpful when I was taken ill and required special considerations.Other small but nice features of this hotel, are the switches on the back of the door, which can be turned red for DO NOT DISTURB or green, so that a member of staff can ring your doorbell for service.The library downstairs is very small but comfortable and there is a good selection of books/papers, plus computers with internet. There is also free and speedy wifi throughout the hotel.We would definitely stay again if we needed a comfortable bed in midtown again.","Los Angeles, California","Rachel B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",11,4.0

We were ther three nights and by the end, the room we found the room ok. The big selling points for us were the location, which couldn't be better plus free wifi and that it was clean and quiet.

For a first time visitor to NYC it is amazingly close to about everything. We barely used public transport during our stay. Walking and a few taxi trips solved about all of the transportation.The rooms are nicely appointed with a really comfortable bead, and a clean large bathroom. It is not overly large, but not small either. I would describe it as a good standard but not extraordinary.Staff was both great and a bit of a miss. The concierge and the bell boys went above and beyond in helping us and really did a great job. I would recommend talking to them about restaurants, air port transfer, shopping etc. Though the fornt desk staff was more of a miss. They felt clueless in several requests and gave contradictory answers and did not feel that professional or knowledgable.During our stay both the restaurant and the bar was being refurbished, something we were not notified of beforehand. And the breakfast was instead a box collected at the front desk consisting of yoghurt, a croissant and a banana. It was sufficient, but perhaps not something I would expect from a hotel such as this.In summary, it is perfectly located and provides a good nights sleep. But it did not provide me with that feeling of a place that goes above and beyond, though the bell boys certainly do!","Stockholm, Sweden","erhel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",22,4.0

I am happy to report that the love affair continues.I was greeted upon arrival with a ""welcome back"" upon giving my name, by the charming and very efficient male receptionist upon check-in. The room I was given (901) felt smaller than the room my partner and I were given the year before but nonetheless it was comfortable as we remembered with all the amenities (complimentary water and chocolates) upon arrival. The wi-fi which is also included in the room rate has good and strong signal and as I was in New York on business, was greatly appreciated. The New York Times is delivered to the room every day except for Sunday (understandably as it huge and heavy) which is how I discovered the joys of the library in the hotel where one can read it while enjoying a coffee from the complimentary coffee dispenser in the lobby. The library also has two computers for guests to use. I must say that it's very nice to be greeted warmly by hotel staff whenever they are encountered in the hotel lobby and when one leaves or returns.The only thing we had forgotten from our previous visit and that can be constituted as a minor criticism was that there are no ice machines on the floors and that you have to call reception to have it delivered which it is usually done very promptly, but not always. There also was no fridge but there was a mini-bar on a sensor tray on top of chest of drawers which looked ridiculous and incongruous. We did find a card that said a fridge was available if required. My partner and I laughed as we reviewed the room, as we wondered where they possibly could put a fridge in a room that was already choc-a-bloc. It would have been a lot better to get rid of the annoying sensor tray altogether with it's vastly over-priced never used contents as I or my partner were always inadvertently knocking the mini-bottles of booze down on it panicking us that we might trigger charges for stuff we didn't have.Our room was quiet as it didn't face the street.The beds were superbly comfortable, the bathroom spotless,the water pressure and temp control perfect, though the drains in both the shower and the wash-basin took a long time to clear.

You can't hear much noise from the street (with the exception of the odd garbage truck or siren which you would hear anywhere in NY). The rooms are not large but then most hotel rooms in NY are not big. However being so close to Times Square and several subway stations was great. You can walk to many attractions such as the Rockerfeller Centre and USS Intrepid.

We went to Radio City Music Hall for show, and to Rockefeller Centre to Top of the Rock and these were just a nice walk away. Check out Gregory's Coffee across the street, they have excellent coffee and try the pound cake, yummy! Also close to tons of restaurants close. The Red Flame Diner is a great spot for a very reasonably priced tasty bite. We went for breakfast, was very good.Service was very good. The concierge was very helpful. We found everyone to be quite friendly and it had a personal touch.The hotel was old in a good way, it had character and nice touches. It was very clean and quaint.We got a competitive rate on a package deal and was satisfied with value for this property.Cons: Our room was very small, which I understand is typical of Manhatten, however it was much smaller than another Manhatten hotel we stayed in last year. Also it had no view, just into another room's Window and a brick wall. Most disappointing was the bed, which was much shorter than standard size perhaps needed to fit into the small room. I'm well over 6 ft tall wasn't the most comfortable. Also my wife was surprised they didn't have a hairdryer, which is typically standard in most hotels.

Pros-Great location between Times Square and 5th ave.Comfortable bedsVery cleanOlder style but updated nicelyAwesome for a romantic getaway or for a solo travelerConsVery dark in lobby, not welcomingBellhop not available to open doors for people? Wonderful guys but never around to help. We happened to be coming back to the hotel and had to help arriving guests with large luggage up the stairs on three seperate occasions. I understand it was very hot outside, but when we would walk by other boutique hotels, bellhops were outside sweating it out.FYI there are stairs to get into the front door, not many but enough when hauling luggage. Because the building is older and it was in the 90s during our stay, our home was very warm and we had it turned down all the way. Sorry, I like it really cool when I do come back to rest especially when you have been walking, shopping and sweating all day. Rooms are tiny and yes I know that is the standard for New York BUT if you have a party of 4 and are not reserving a suite than you need to look at other hotels. I have stayed at plenty others that have much larger rooms. Because it is a boutique hotel and very small, I guess I thought we would be greeted when we would walk in or leave. The bellhop would greet us as he was standing by the front desk half the time instead of the door. :)For me, I just didn't get the exciting fun feel of New York as I have other times.

The room was noisy which we expected because it was right on 44th and it was generally clean but really annoyingly the A/C (and heat) are centralised and controlled by the front desk. My wife was freezing in the room but the only way to control the temperature is to open and close the vents in the room so it was either stuffy because there was no air coming in or very cold.

Still, we felt duped by the description of the room we originally booked and, for the price we ultimately paid, could have stayed in a nicer hotel.

The room was just brilliant. Whilst not the largest hotel room, it was perfectly sized for our needs and we found the view to be perfect and just what we wanted.As it was our honeymoon, the Hotel staff had provided chocolate covered strawberries, chocolates, a bottle of wine and a nice congratulations letter. We thought this was a really nice gesture and started our trip off on a very positive note. Back to the room, The bed was super comfy and the bathroom was well laid out with a large amount of towels. The room doesn't come with a regular fridge as standard, it has a minibar style cooler which will charge you if you tamper with any of the contents however I believe a regular fridge can be provided if necessary. The rooms AC was a Godsend given how warm NY is this time of year. Walking back into the room after a scorching hot day was always a relief!Even if we had the do not disturb on the door, we would recieve a complimentary call in the evening asking if we would like our room cleaned later on anyway which is rare nowadays and a welcome choice.The hotel staff, from front desk to the cleaners were all very polite and always eager to please. I would especially like to thank the three doormen we had most contact with; John, Carlos and Rocky. They opened doors, helped with our luggage and would hail cabs whenever we left on a day trip. The only negative I could mention was the hotel only having one elevator. It's a minor complaint but staying on the 11th floor often meant we were waiting a little while on an elevator that wasn't packed full.

For those coffee lovers who can't bear the thought of drinking Starbucks, Stumptown Coffee is a 20 minute walk away at the base of the Ace Hotel at 18 West 29th St, in my opinion, far and away the best coffee in Manhattan, and for the caffeine addicted, well worth the walk.","Sydney, Australia","MikalP_12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",26,5.0

My only complaint is the bathroom which has very little room for toiletry storage and there is no fan so a shower will steam up the mirror. This is my fourth stay at this hotel and I think it's close to perfect. Times Square is so chaotic, noisy and crowded. Being close to 5th Ave, it's still an easy walk to theaters and even closer to the best shopping street in NYC. The room was ultra quiet and dark, and the bed was comfortable--all important components of a making me a happy guest. Unfortunately during our stay, one elevator was out of commission.

We arrived at 12 noon, too early to get into the rooms but the staff were very helpful; took our bags, gave us help with restaurant bookings, etc. We came back at around 5.45pm, were given room keys, and told the luggage would be sent straight up. The luggage took nearly 15 minutes to arrive and in fact I was on my way to get it when it arrived at the 3rd floor. I should have just taken it up myself. I then unpacked the things that I needed for 2 days, got into my bathrobe and went to have a shower - only to discover that there was no water. I phoned down to reception to be told how the shower worked. On trying again I then had to phone once again, as there really was no water. Someone was sent up, maybe 10 minutes later - but not a member of the front desk staff - some poor chap who couldn't fix the water and simply had to report back to reception. I phoned AGAIN as I still hadn't heard anything. The man came back with a new room key, but it was unclear as to whether this was my new room or somewhere to have a shower. He said he would move my stuff - but I was still in my bathrobe, due to go out in half an hour, and needed my stuff! So I ended up piling it all into a heap and moving it right then. On getting downstairs to reception I imparted my feelings and, of course, the staff were very apologetic. But my 'rest' time had been wrecked, and I just felt that the whole point of booking into a hotel like this was to avoid exactly this kind of problem. When I got back to my room there was a letter of apology and wine and chocolates, and an invitation to breakfast, which was a very nice gesture, but I'd have rather not have had the hassle.Good things - the bar in Triomphe was lovely, and the Lanterns Keep bar is really special. The location is fantastic. The staff are friendly and polite. Not so good - only one lift working, the wi-fi is a bit touch and go, and the rooms were comfortable (especially the bed), but very slightly shabby. The paintwork could do with renewing, and both the rooms I saw were very dark. There was no vanity mirror in the room I was moved to.I am aware that I sound extremely fussy, but I'm really not. I often stay in travelodges or similar and am very happy with it - but having splashed out to stay somewhere really speacial, I expected more for the money. I've stayed at 2 other hotels in the 'small luxury' range recently and they were both better experiences. I'm sure that the Iroquois experience can be fantastic, but unfortunately it wasn't for me, on this occasion.","London, United Kingdom","clareuk_11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",27,3.0

Check in was quick and easy and all the Receptionist staff were very friendly. We were offered an upgrade to our room which we delinced as it was an extra $30 per night (we wanted to keep our money to spend) but it was nice to be offered.After reading a lot of the reviews on here i was worried about the size of the room as people mentioned the rooms were very small. We didnt find this the case, the room was a good size. it fitted us and our suitcases with room to move about. The next time we stay at this hotel i'd like to see what a bigger room has to offer but in our opinion the room was a good size. We stayed in room 805 (superior queen) the only thing i could fault with this room was the view from the window which was just a brick wall. It meant we didnt get much day light coming in and werent to sure what kind of weather it was outside but you dont go to New York to stay in your hotel room so it really didnt matter to us that much. The bathroom was lovely and the molton brown toiletries a really nice touch. The room has a safe which is a must for us and a large closet with iron and ironing board it also has a Dvd player and the hotel offers complementary dvds.We didnt get a chance to speak to the Concierge much as he was always busy with other guests but we did ask what bar would be best to go watch the Scotland vs Usa football match and he directed us to a great bar. All of the staff in the iroquois were so friendly and helpful and coming in to a nightly turn down service after a long day sightseeing was so nice.

One other downside - I charged drinks to the room - they were $20/each. They were basic martini's - fair warning. I had a lemon drop martini. I forget what the other person had.

I do not typically stay in the Times Square neighborhood because it is dirty, noisy, and crowded with tourists, but I had business meetings up and down the West side so for this trip it made sense. If you like to take public transportation, you can hardly get more central or accessible than Times Square. When I arrived I was greeted warmly and checked in efficiently, and throughout my stay the staff was friendly and helpful. My room was tiny and dark with one small window looking out into an air shaft, but not uncomfortable, and I had a nice and immaculately clean bathroom. The furniture and carpet are a bit outdated and worn, but not terribly so. The photos on the hotel's website seem to be a pretty accurate representation--one photo resembled my room almost exactly. For a solo traveler, my tiny room was fine, but it would be a bit tight for more than one person.As a place to just come home and sleep--which is essentially what I did--the Iroquois was more than adequate. And for the price I paid, I felt it was a very good value. However, I was surprised to see when looking at their regular rates that a room like mine often sells for over $500/night. Had I paid $500 for this room I would have been outraged--this isn't a $500/night room, and honestly, charming as it is, in my opinion it's not a $500/night hotel. So watch Expedia and other sites for good rates and if you are taking a trip to NY to see shows, this is a good home base for the right price.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","TripsPlease</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",60,4.0

Don't get me wrong, it has all the appearances of being a great hotel on the surface, but there were a number of things that surprised me. The hotel is in a great location and is well maintained. Our king room was nice, but the view wasn't that great. The staff at the Lantern's Keep were a highlight of our one night stay.All of that being said, the service leaves a lot to be desired. The check-in staff were not particularly friendly. Basically it was check-in and sign here. I don't recall even being asked if there was anything we needed. I figured it was an aberration and didn't think much of it and we went off to our room. Upon getting to our Executive King room, I was really dismayed at the lack of a view. I guessed wrongly in assuming the higher priced room would have a better view. I called down to the desk and asked if anything else was available. The person said she would check and call back. She called back and said that nothing was available and then proceeded to give me a NYC street geography lesson to justify the answer. There was no answer to my question if less expensive rooms had a better view. Is there an inverse relationship between view and room size? At least the person called back.My wife and I decide to walk downstairs and catch a cab. We walk down the front steps without being acknowledged by the doorman, who is busy staring at the sidewalk. My wife proceeds into the street to hail a cab, where I can view the doorman at Sofitel and City Club hailing cabs for their guests. Our doorman is still staring at the ground until a 20-something woman pops up and ""grabs"" his attention. He proceeds at this point to practically go out of his way to help them in any way he can. Meanwhile, my wife is still waiting for a cab. Finally, I go to the front desk and ask if anyone can help us with a cab, which finally gets someone's attention. Another person, not the one who ignored us, tries to hail a cab, but then he tells us that it would likely be impossible to get a cab because of the shift change (which it turns out is probable) and suggest we find alternate means of transportation. We eventually give up and take the subway.Our room was a nice room. It was an ADA-compliant room according to the sign and had grab-bars near the lavatory and the tub. The odd thing was that it had a tub that a person in a wheelchair would be unlikely to use, since it had a sliding glass door and would appear to be relatively inaccessible to a disabled person. It's just my opinion, I'm sure it's legally compliant. The deadbolt on the door would not latch. It turned when the door was open, so it appeared to be operational. However, the bolt would not move when the door was closed. It made us a little nervous, but we figured the security was good enough. Still, it was annoying for a relatively high-end hotel. The thermostats are basically for show. The building is centrally controlled, so I think the thermostat does very little than open a valve for heating or cooling and perhaps controls a fan. We were comfortable, but I can't imagine what it's like on a warm day during winter.The service issues cropped up again when we decided to check out. It was basically a repeat of the check-in process - ""What's your room number?"" and sign here. No question about our stay even though the other person handling check out for another guest asked repeatedly.Don't even get me started about the elevators. The sign explaining the situation with the elevators is just ridiculous. Spend the money and fix it. The current situation is annoying to the guests and must have an effect on the efficiency of the service and housekeeping staff.My wife and I were trying to come up with a common denominator for our interactions with the staff and the best we could come up with was I guess we didn't look the part of an Iroquois guest. My wife and I are very casual people when we vacation even though we are well-ranked executives in both of our firms. We dress up when we have to, but dress down at any available chance. In all three cases, it appears that the person who was more well-dressed seemed to get more attention form the staff. My advice to the staff is my money is the same color of green as others and I tend to tip very well despite my t-shirt and jeans.At least I got a free shoe shine.","Somerset, New Jersey","Robert T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Somerset, New Jersey</strong>",5,3.0

Having stayed in New York a couple of times before I knew that some of the hotels can be very poor with small rooms. The Iroquois is nothing like that, great staff as soon as you enter, on the doors and on reception, always welcoming and helpful. Our room was on the 8th floor and was a nice size with a really comfortable bed. Room was of a wall which was a little disappointing but not unusual for NYC. Only let downs was the construction on the lifts with drlling noise (during the day when we were out anyway) and the constant noise in the room from what I can only discribe as a constant air con noise (even though I had that turned off) and pipe noises every so often from the bathroom. Sleeping wasn't great for me as these noises kept waking me up. You do soon get used to it and was only minor. Location is amazing close to 5th Av, Grand Central and Times Square, really easy to get around. Would stay here again.

Huge bathroom, totally modern, with lovely tiles, Molton Brown goodies, and lots of fluffy white towels. The room was the super quiet - I never heard anyone next door, above or below. And the bed and pillows were just right. Nice desk area for working, a decent sized closet. OK, my view was of the fire escape, but that's pretty much all you get in NY, so I'm fine with that.

The first night I had a drink in the restaurant bar and had the best Cosmo I've had in years.

It was 4pm, so we were herded into the restaurant bar, where all the employees seemed to make as much noise as they could. I'd assumed the 'Libary' was a public room as it had computers in it - and it was empty when we walked in. Aside from that one issue, it was a great stay.

Luckily, we contacted the hotel reservations beforehand and ended up choosing a suite (one of 12 only). So the room was of a good size, though the bathroom still required some exercise - it is not easy for two people to fit in it at the same time. NYC was not so cold when we were there, and it was good as the small bathroom window did let the cold air in. It was not insulated. The staff made an effort to help us w/ our requests, including complimentary tea on Sunday, when the hotel restaurants are closed. In the last day, we asked for a late check-out for which we paid about USD 140.00 and had to change rooms. Then we were given the opportunity to assess how lucky we had been w/ our suite choice. The room we moved to was next to the gym and it is tiny! I suspect all the rooms in that corner are the same size. No minibar as it would not fit in, the window opens to the emergency stairs outside and our oversized luggage did not make its way between the bed and the chest. It had to be lifted to be placed into the closet. The closed was slightly bigger than the tiny one in the suite, though, and although the bathroom did not have a separate shower and bath tub, it was almost the same size as the suite bathroom.

After reading many satisfied reviews for this property and seeing their competitive rates for my President's Day weekend to NYC, I booked with the Iroquois.I took the advice of several reviewers and joined the hotel's ""Gold Guest"" program prior to my arrival. After joining, I received a couple of friendly messages from the Iroquois staff, welcoming me to the program and asking me some preferences for my room and tastes. After checking in, all those preferences were granted. I was on an upper level floor, there were chocolate truffles, sparkling water & a bottle of red wine, all compliments of the hotel. It was a great start to my stay. Additionally, the staff at the front desk upgraded my basic room to a deluxe queen compliments of the hotel. Whatever their reason for the free upgrade, I appreciated the gesture and I thank tripadvisor reviewers for their advice.What most comes to mind when thinking of the Iroquois is the value. Along with the welcome gifts, you get free wireless internet in your room. There is a business center (library) that allows you to use their computers and printers free of charge. You get a daily newspaper... even the Sunday NY Times, free. Plus, the little things like the morning coffee in the lobby and hotel apple cider in the evening... and the milk chocolate on the pillows they do at evening turn-down. These gestures by the hotel greatly enhanced my stay and, in my opinion, made the Iroquois the best value in town... Like no other I have experienced in NYC.I compliment the Iroquois management on the way they run their hotel.

The room was clean, but extremely small, even by NYC standards, but I think we had the smallest room on our floor when looking at the evacuation routes and floor plan posted to our door. I had requested a king sized bed and a room facing the street, and while I was advised those requests would be considered, neither was fulfilled. The room was clean, but the queen bed was small - both mine and my husbands' feet dangled off the edge. Since we only stayed the weekend, it wasn't that big of a deal, but if our trip was longer it would have become a problem. They served complimentary hot apple cider every afternoon in the lobby, which was delicious. It is a small, boutique hotel, but reasonably priced in an amazing location - we did not have to cab or take the subway our whole weekend and we went to Central Park, Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue, Rockefellar Center and the Meat Packing District.

It's a hotel bar-hopper's dream as well, since the Mansfield, Sofitel, Royalton, and Algonquin are on the same block. (The Algonquin is closed for renovation until at least May 2012.) The Bryant Park/42nd street subway station is a two-minute walk away, which allows access to several lines. Grand Central is slightly farther, but also has several other subway lines, so it's very easy to use public transportation from this starting point. I went all over the City and only used a cab once, and that was because it was late at night. This is a small boutique hotel, so everything is compact and cozy, but they have done a remarkable job of keeping the character of this 1930's-era building while updating it for modern needs and expectations. The lobby is charming with marble floors, a chandelier, and dark walls. There's a small library facing the street with complimentary computer/printer access and a selection of newspapers. The lobby offers complimentary cider in the winter as well. Off to the right of the lobby is the restaurant Triomphe (which also provides the room service). It has a small bar area in the front, then a cozy, small dining room. I only had breakfast here so I can't comment on any other menus, but it was fast, done precisely to order, and very efficiently served. To the back of the lobby is the cocktail salon, Lantern's Keep. It is, as they say, a ""jewel box"" of a room done in a Paris salon style. The juices are all fresh-squeezed and there is a terrific selection of house-created cocktails on the menu served by fantastic bartenders who will chat while they work even though they're busy without missing a beat. A stop here is a must if you stay at the Iroquois, though they aren't kidding when they suggest reservations. With only a couple of dozen seats, it can fill up very quickly and once here, you won't be inclined to leave for a while. The rooms are quite small, but space has been used efficiently. Tall leather headboards affixed to the wall give them a smart look and there is plenty of closet and drawer space. The beds are very comfortable. The mini-bar is a little pedestrian and it's one of those sensor-driven things, but at least the rooms are equipped with them. My bathroom seemed larger than those pictured on the website. The room was at the end of a hallway, so I thought perhaps the floor plan was a little different. Water temperature and pressure were great, which is a relief in an older building. Higher floors facing 44th St. have decent views of the block and some of the skyscrapers beyond--I requested one when I made my reservation and they took pains to ensure that at check-in. The rooms are equipped with DVD players and you will be provided with a password to the complimentary wi-fi when you check in. These extras are much-appreciated. For me, the true 5-star hotels in New York are high-luxury places like the St. Regis, the Mandarin Oriental, and the Four Seasons. As a boutique property, the Iroquois is not equipped to provide the same range of options and level of room size/quality. But they also don't have the pricetags of those hotels, and it's not their aim to be one of those guys. If you can score one of their frequent package or multiple-night discount deals online, then the combination of value, comfort, and location provided here make it one of the very top boutiques in the city.Side note: Also on the same block is the Greek restaurant Kellari, which has a sensational grilled octopus dish.","Durham, North Carolina","adamunc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Durham, North Carolina</strong>",262,4.0

The hotel is on 44th, which is quiet, so after a long day you can get some sleep. They are also across the street from Gregory's, which has good coffee and pastries. What I liked most about this hotel is that it's not busy so you feel very comfortable and at home. The gym has the basics and there is a small sauna which is nice. Food at their restaurant is really good, but a little pricey. Their bar is nice too because it's not busy. Their bartender Alex is awesome!

The Iroquois is an 'old school' hotel, with a lovely ambience, right in the heart of the theatres, not far from Times Square, but surprisingly quiet (maybe because it was Sunday?)... Friendly service, from the doormen to the receptionist. We were told that our room was small, and was offered an upgrade (for a modest fee) but said we'd have a look first and let them know. It was quite small, but adequate for our needs, ie sleep. They even phoned the room to see if we were satisfied, which we were. It was clean and well stocked...On our return from seeing Rock of Ages (fantastic, by the way) our bed had been turned down, choccies on the pillow, and new towels provided. In the morning, a complimentary NY Times was hung in a cloth bag outside the door. Moulton and Brown toiletries. Good shower/bath (just one thing, it started to go a bit cold near the end of my shower, but no biggy)...In the morning. complimentary coffee in the lobby, then hot apple cider in the afternoon... both delicious. We checked out but left our bags for a few hours as we had time to explore a few more places before our train left Grand Central (very close and handy also). Nothing was too much trouble.We didn't eat there, as the restaurant was closed for the Sunday night, but there were loads of places up and down W44th St...so not a problem at all.All in all, a wonderful hotel (oh, and James Dean actually lived there for a while in the '50's!)

The furnishings were first class. The bathroom was fitted with high quality fixtures and the shower met my high standards. Service was excellent. I had some trouble getting heat and the engineer came to my room instantly. My requests to the front desk and concierge were met quickly and helpfully.

The positives are many - location is excellent and how many times can I say how wonderful it was to be right next to db Bistro Moderne...it was like having Daniel Boulud for room service! We were attending the Jay Z/Kanye show at MGM and it was fantastic being so close to the Garden. We encountered an overall quality of service and friendliness at the hotel that would make this a return destination for us. Comfy bed - GREAT shower - always important to me and this one was perfect. On the down side - the rooms are VERY small so if you need workspace this might not be the one for you. The ""desk"" was a glorified nightstand crammed right next to the bed but we made it work and how much time do you really spend in the room in this amazing city anyway?! Biggest faux pas was probably upon check in when the nice young man who helped us was getting a bottle of wine sent up to the room which never showed up - and with the larger Sofitel next door - they struggle a bit with the cab situation.Really not much to say except this is a great little hotel with a good staff, a comfy bed, awesome shower and a great location....really all you need here in NY.

Something quite nice about the coziness of the reception area versus the large terminal size lobbys of larger hotels. Didnt eat at the hotel, as it is so centrally located there are loads of places nearby, but prices looked very reasonable for a NY hotel. For breakfast head to the Red Flame diner just down the street full of tourists but also lots of locals come in. Complimentary coffee available in the hotel lobby from 7am was a nice touch. We stayed in a suite, which was perfect for us, but it want ostentatious and overly stuffed with useless amenties, but it was a nice comfortable space. My only 2 minor whinges:1) the fact that the curtains don't close, there are wooden blinds, but these really didnt block out the street lights or sunlight2) we were on the 11th floor but we could hear every person walking down the street and it was very noisy...if you are a light sleeper, you will struggle with a street facing room and will need to ask for an inner room (I will be next time!)Was very impressed with the speed with which the concierge rustled up a limo to the airport at peak rush hour..literally minutes.

The stay started badly as I arrived on a parade day, had some trouble walking to the hotel from the bus drop off at Grand Central due to road closures but finally made it there a little after 2 pm. I was told the room was not ready yet, that check-in was at 3 pm and that I could upgrade and have a room immediately if I wanted. I declined the option to upgrade and opted to wait out the hour till check-in by leaving my luggage with the hotel and going shopping. I returned at 3:30 pm or so, checked into my room, went up to my room and waited for my luggage. It took a while and finally my suitcase was delivered but not my carry-on. It turns out that another departing guest had taken my luggage by mistake through a series of bad luck occurrences - she sent her friend to retrieve her carry-on, her friend did not know what it looked like and did not have a claim slip, chose my carry-on by mistake eventhough it was nothing like her friend's and rushed out with it. I spent an anxious hour or so waiting for the other guest to return from the airport with my carry-on as I was worried about the personal information and contents of my carry-on. In the end everything worked out, the lady returned from JFK having missed her flight but with my carry-on to exchange for her correct one, and nothing was missing from my carry-on. The hotel staff were most apologetic. Front-desk offered a couple of free drinks coupon, the manager responded to an e-mail I sent about the incident and assured me their procedures were being reviewed to prevent another such incident and offered a stay in a suite at their best available price next time. The most touching though was the effort from the bellman who came up to my room subsequently with a plate of chocolates and nuts and a bottle of wine in apology. I declined the wine as I don't drink but accepted the chocolates and nuts as he was insistent that I do so. In summary, I had a problem at the hotel but they managed to respond well to the incident and, lucky for all it happened on check-in rather than check-out when a delay with the carry-on might have had much more serious consequences. On a side note, I discovered that one of the concierge was someone I knew from my stays at the Casablanca Hotel who previously impressed me with her thoughtful and efficient service, and bright smile and warm greeting each time. It is a credit to the Iroquois that such a wonderful employee moved over from the Casablanca given how fine a hotel the Casablanca is as well. Aside from the incident, the hotel was fine. The room was large and comfortable, free wi-fi was included, location is excellent just off Times Square and with lots of subway stations near by and many restaurants within close walking distance. DB Bistro Moderne almost next door was surprisingly good and not stuffy notwithstanding its celebrity chef background, and the diner down the street from the Iroquois was excellent value, efficient and convenient for an early 6 am breakfast or a late bite. My favourite in New York is usually the Casablanca for its unbeatable location, service and value-enhancing inclusions, but the Iroquois also compares well, especially because I managed to book at a fixed prepaid discount rate that was about $100 cheaper per night than comparable hotels at the same time.",Vancouver,"VancTraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver</strong>",137,4.0

I was told ahead of time, that hotel rooms in NY are generally small so I did not expect too much at arrival. The rooms are small but very nicely furnished. The linen is so comfy, the towels and bathrobe extremely fluffy and all in all the room very clean and comfortable. Most people are in the room to sleep only anyway, so no need for a huge room. The shower gel etc. are from MoltonBrown so very good quality and they smell great. The little bar serves nice cocktails in the evening and they also have a business center where you can use the internet free of charge. The staff was very friendly and accomodating and always quick to offer help, if you looked like you need something. The Concierge was a great help as well. I had tried to get tickets for the new World Trade Center memorial prior to our trip but it was fully booked. The lady at the concierge desk got me tickets. She also explained very well everything else we needed to know. The hotel itself is in an excellent location, walking distance to Time Square, Rockefeller Center, Broadway, Fifth Ave, ...Would certainly recommend this place to anybody interested going to NY.","Los Angeles, California","bellalinchen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",38,5.0

He not only checked us in quickly, but made us comfortable in knowing that if we needed anything he would do everything to get it for us.

But the lower floors have several rooms with large generators immediately outside if the windows. One of these generators was outside of my room on my first night in the hotel. At first, I thought it was just a noisy air conditioner but when I realised I could not stop the racket, I called the front desk who sent a maintenance guy upstairs. He informed me in that charming New York fashion, ""It's the generator outside your window. There's nothing I can do. This is New York. It can be loud here. You got a loud room"". When I protests that this was unacceptable, he referred me back to the front desk who assured me that I had a rare condition of sleep sensitivity and most people never had any such problem. I told the night clerk that this was clearly nonsense, especially as he could hear the generator OVER THE PHONE! Finally, at around 2:00 am, I was offered an alternative room. This was s special room designed for the handicapped which I was understandably, but again inconveniently forced to vacate the next day.The ultimate outcome of all of this for me was that I was an utter zombie at my business meeting the next day for which I had flown to New York.From now on, I'm paying the extra $100 per night to stay in the Sofitel next door.",London,"Travelling_30s</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",59,2.0

This came close but it wasn't perfect, I must admit. The hotel is quite unimpressive when you arrive. If you've been to the US before you will be used to an impressive lobby, usually that's where the money goes. There was no doorman and the lobby is dark. There are limited facilities but there is free coffee in the lobby and iced water and there is a PC available for for free internet access. It gets better once you get to your room. True, they are on the small side (but you are in a city) and the view is non-existent, well it was from our room anyway. However, I was travelling with my mother and I had a lot of problems finding a hotel room with two double beds in a luxury hotel that didn't cost the earth. This had them, with fab linen and Molton Brown toiletries, all at a very reasonable $350 inc tax per night over Easter weekend. The room would have been better if they'd removed the enormous office style chair that was stuck between the two beds. I'm really not sure why it was there, unless they expected the bedside table to double as a desk. Obviously they did. The closet was small, but we were only there for 2 nights so it didn't matter. The room had everything we needed and the welcome plate of free pastries and cookies was a nice touch. The location is the best thing though.......just off 5th Ave and on a great block full of eating establishments, we were spoilt for choice and cancelled our pre-arranged reservations at Aquavit as a result. Note, there is a fantastic Indian on this street, something of a rarity in NYC. I've spent years traipsing all over the city, I won't do that again. We got so much more out of our 3 days by staying in this location. We did pop into the Royalton over the road which I liked a lot. It wasn't my mother's style though. The Algonquin is also on the same street, it's been taken over by Marriott and I don't know what it's like but, again, the location couldn't be more highly recommended. Back to the Iroquois though, I dealt with the management over a booking error before I arrived and they couldn't be more helpful. This is a hotel that's trying hard and succeeding in the main. I would recommend it and would definitely consider another stay here in future.","Marlborough, United Kingdom","Mac7471</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marlborough, United Kingdom</strong>",120,4.0

We found very friendly and helpful, and we appreciated the many small touches that made us feel welcome (complimentary water in the room, chocolates on the pillow, complimentary NY Times in the morning and free wireless Internet).

Fabulous beds, beautifully clean and luxurious bathrooms, complimentary bathrobes, evening turndown service with proper european milk chocolstes left on the bed with a little weather forecast card for the next day, a safe and iron and ironing board mean everything you need is here. There's a very good quality award winning restaurant in house (Triomphe), but we were on a limited budget so only ate there once. Most mornings we ate at the Red Flame, turn right out of the hotel and walk 50 yards- excellent, filling, good value no-frills food. The hotel location is just perfect- far enough away from Times Square to be quiet, but just a five minute walk to it when you want to see the bright lights and soak up the atmosphere! Radio City is just around the corner and the theares of Broadway are only 5-10 minutes walk away also. As others have mentioned, take the Gray Line tours at $54 for unlimited 48 hour use of their four most popular tours. Also, for cheaper theatre tickets on the day, go to the clearance ticket booths behind the seating stand in Times Square- they open from 11:00 for matinees and 15:00 for evening performances.

The hotel is surrounded by bigger, morer famous (and maybe infamous?) hotels, such as the Algonquin and the Sofitel, and they are so popular because of a terrific location between 5th and 6th Avenue, which is so handy for so much of the city.The hotel has a fairly small and restrained lobby, but staff are friendly and helpful. There are two PCs in a library just off the lobby, one of which seemed to be free just about all the time. There is a ready supply in the lobby of iced water with lemon or other fruit. which always hit the mark on those baking hot days we were in and out of the hotel.Our rooms were on the 4th floor. They were clean and comfortable, though not particulary spcaious. They both looked out onto a fire escape, which made the rooms quiet, but also very gloomy. I guess that's normal in New York City, unless you have the funds for a high end hotel overlooking Central Park (I wish.....).Just after we arrived, the lights in one of the rooms failed for some reason, but a call to reception brought forth the repairman, who was with us in less than two minutes - pretty impressive. He fixed the problem and it didn't recur.The free wireless worked pretty well in one room, but was fairly weak in the other. The restaurant looked like it had an interesting menu, but was maybe a little pricey for our needs. Indeed, the breakfast option seemed very overpriced at $19 or $20, but there are other decent places within a few yards of the hotel, so never fear.This was out first time in NYC (from over the pond) and my wife and I and our two kids (21 and 18) adored the city and appreciated the hotel and its qualities.","Brockenhurst, UK","CliveMilone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brockenhurst, UK</strong>",16,4.0

We booked a king executive room. All of these types of rooms are in the back of the bulding, which doesn't do much for a view, but it does stay a little quieter since you're not right on the street. They do have two room family suites in the front of the bulding, which I understand if you get the right room, you can see the Chrystler Building. The hotel is in an AMAZING location. NYC is a very walkable city, but where this hotel is located took it beyond that. We were only a couple of blocks away from all the major sights. Times Square was extremely close, 5th avenue was at the end of the street, numerous parks right down the street too. Not to mention a great selection and choice of fine quality, average Joe, and street food establishments. The hotel is also very closely located to all the major subway lines going up and down the island, as well as across the river to Queens. If subways aren't for you, central park and several of the museums are well within walking distance....it will take you a little while to get there (traffic, people, distance), but we made it from this hotel to central park in about 30-40 minutes. This should also help for the ladies...the hotel was close enough to the theater district, my wife and I went to see The Lion King, fully dressed (we had a ""fancy"" dinner before the show) in suit, dresses, and my wife in her high heels. She made the walk with much ease.The staff was very friendly and helpful. Since this is a smaller boutique hotel they get to know their guests. The rooms are nicely furnished and provide an ample resting area for your many adventures you are sure to have in NYC.My wife and I had a HUGE delay on our way to NYC due to weather, but the staff was ready and willing to help us get situated once we arrived. We didn't get in until almost 10pm and I figured it would be a ghost town, we'd have to beg to get the room we requested, etc. Much to my surprise, they had our room we asked for, a staffed front desk, and a bellhop to help with our luggage. It might as well have been the middle of the day with the service we received.We were very hungry after our long day of travel and we were able to order some room service right when we got to our room, and it was delivered VERY quickly. I have to say, though, that $80 for some crabcakes and a burger was a little much for my taste, but we were STARVING!!!The next morning we decided to visit the little cafe in the hotel lobby for breakfast. Again, the food was good, but the price was way too much. This would be the last meal we had in our hotel. One, because of the price, but also because there were so many great places around the hotel to get less expenssive food. I recommend this diner right on the corner by the hotel....I beleive it was called the red flame diner or something like that. It's really good whatever it is called, haha! We had breakfast there every day and you could tell it was alocal place that real New Yorkers went to. The prices were outstanding and you got A LOT of food.Overall, I think that this hotel provided an excellent place for my wife and I to enjoy our honeymoon and it was the cherry on top of our time in NYC.","Chino Hills, California","Jsaxm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chino Hills, California</strong>",39,4.0

The first night I checked in, the room was extremely hot and the thermostat was off. I called the front desk and they sent someone up to check it out. All they did was move the thermometer to 50 degrees. This did absolutely nothing. I tossed and turned all night and was only able to sleep for 2 hours due to the intense heat.

Noone appeared until I had to once again call and complain about the situation. This was after my 5th phone call! I was never offered to switch to another room and no additional amenity was sent for my inconvenience.

Beware the electronic sensors in the room's mini-bar fridge. I stored my water bottles, which I'd bought elsewhere, in there, but the sensors indicated I'd *taken* two drinks. At check-out, I was not charged for the drinks after the guy at reception asked if I'd put any items *in* the fridge.The internet connection was occasionally slow, and often my laptop would be directed to the Algonquin nearby. :) But for the most part, I could connect both my laptop and iPhone to the Iroquois easily.

But take that with a grain of salt as I've been watching a lot of ghost shows on TV lately.Location-wise, it's great for those who want to see Broadway shows yet stay away from the neon and chaos of Times Square. It's still close enough to walk to theatres. I felt safe at all times, even late at night. Bryant Park is two blocks away, Grand Central Station, Radio City Music Hall and the Rockefeller Center are also close. I had the best-tasting hot dogs on the corner of Fifth and 46th. Pret-a-Manger, Jamba Juice and Crumbs (cupcakes) are good places to pick up some nibbles, but there are quite a few good restaurants nearby, too.Overall, I loved my stay at the Iroquois and I'd go there again.","Sydney, Australia","Hot_Dog_Addict</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",1,5.0

The quality and location (about 1/3 of a mile from Times Square and Radio City Music Hall) of this small luxury hotel is impressive. This great thing is: it comes at a fair price!In my opinion, what separate a nice hotel from a great hotel are the small touches. The Iroquois understands that and seem to always go the extra mile to make your stay a great one. The staffs are always smiling, classy and willing to help.The room (we booked ""Deluxe room"" which has a queen bed) was big enough (for NYC) , impeccably clean and very well decorated in a classic/chic design. The white marble bathroom was a winner for my girlfriend. The bed and sheets were very comfortable.I would have given a perfect score, but there were two minor annoyances. Room door was not tight in his sockets, so each time another door on the floor would open, it would make our rattle like someone was trying to enter (scared the hell out of my girl friend twice during first night). I fixed this issue by jamming folded paper between door and frame. Also, temperature control was not responsive (or not working).

I had read all the reviews on-line, which were positive, and knew it was a member of the Small Luxury Hotels Group, so I was not too surprised when we walked into the rather simple, small lobby. It is not a place to see and be seen; if you want that, try one of the many other large hotels in the area. It was clean, with a lived-in look. By that, I mean not modern or high-tech, and with the bonus of friendly not snobby staff.Our room had all the right moving parts, but it was very small. Aside from the welcome gift of fruit, nuts, and chocolates, there was a large flat screen TV, comfy bed, safe, mini-bar, desk, and a chair, but as two people we felt a bit cramped. We had to be creative about placing our suitcases in spaces that would not block anything. (One went into the closet, and the other behind the bathroom door.) There was free Wi-Fi, movie CDs at the front desk, and free morning newspaper of our choice. The bathroom was very clean, and had Molton Brown bath products, plenty of Frette towels and robes, and a well-placed mag mirror. The shower was nice and strong, but when I showered late in the morning, it took a very long time for the hot water to come up. (My husband said his shower was fine.) There was a modern AC unit in the room that was efficient, but not silent. It did act as white noise to drown out the noise of the city, which is certainly a factor at certain times of the day no matter where you stay. Let me also say that because this is an older building, it is quiet. There was no flushing noise, loud echoes from the hallway, or sounds from next door in the middle of the night. Some of that can also be attributed to the lack of convention and large group clients, but it is certainly a plus.Triomphe, the restaurant connected to the hotel is lovely. We had pre-theatre dinner there one night, and enjoyed every bite. This highly rated small gem of a restaurant is soothing, with attentive service and a sophisticated french menu. We did not try their breakfast, but from the looks of the fresh-squeezed juice we saw when checking out, I think it would have been a treat.Would we go back, probably. I think we'd try to get a larger room, if it was not too expensive. Our rate was reasonable compared to other hotels, and we were not there to be in the room too much, but for the convenience. It is close to the subways, major shopping avenues, Broadway and many restaurants. When you list your priorities, The Iroquois comes out looking like a good choice.","Arlington, Virginia","love2trave09</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",100,4.0

Needed an NYC overnight for a Saturday evening show. Selected the Iroquois based on a combination of cost (relatively less than other hotels in general area), location, and user reviews (generally very favorable). Our small, corner room was very comfortable with hints of luxury (bathrobes, elegant bathroom fixtures). Probably not a good choice for breathtaking views of the city (our view was of the side of the adjacent building; we kept the blinds drawn). Very friendly, helpful staff. Parking ($40 / day) is across the street (on the right side of 44th St.), and actually a couple doors before you get to the entrance for the hotel (on the left side). The 44th St. location makes for a convenient walk to the theatres; for us, this was a 9-block walk that is much easier than it might sound.Only two minor hiccups: Since the reservation desk handles the Iroquois and the Chandler hotels, my reservation was initially inadvertently saved for the Chandler Hotel (and I noticed this from the confirmation e-mail). Another clerk readily fixed the snafu during my follow-up phone call. Second was the min-bar/fridge; items there are automatically charged to the room if you remove them for something like 15 seconds, whether or not you put them back. Fortunately, when I explained my mistake to the woman at the front desk, she ensured I was not charged for these.

My friend and I visited the library every evening to check our emails and investigate some of the hot spots to visit in NYC and we frequented the bar a couple of evenings where were greeted with open arms and warm smiles.We did have issues with our telephone not working which became a bit frustrating - we could make long distance calls but could not make local calls (?) After the back and forth between the front desk and maintenance, the hotel manager knocked on our door later that afternoon and delivered a complimentary plate of cashews, strawberries, blackberries and chocolate as an apology for any inconvenience the phone issue may have caused us. It was such a classy touch that was greatly appreciated!What I loved most about The Iroquois is the boutique feeling - it felt very cozy, safe, had that old-world Eurpean feeling I love so much in the heart of the busiest and most famous places in the world.I will definitely book The Iroquois for my next trip to NYC - thanks to all the staff for the great service and for making our first NYC trip such a comfortable and memorable one :)",Niagara,"mimimama69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Niagara</strong>",3,4.0

Exceptional in service and friendliness and willingess to chat. I've stayed in many hotels for business -- this one also a 2 week stay -- and I find the personalized charm much more important than having the modern amenities. I've come away from this hotel with some fond memories of the staff -- hi Iva, Nancy, Bill, Eddie, Robin, JJ, John, Connie, Alex, Casey, and all.Rooms were always clean and serviced well, and I loved the complimentary shoe shine service. Over two weeks, I've had to change rooms 3 times -- from a single king size to a suite for 3 people, to a single double thanks various commitments with friends and family -- all accomodated by the friendly staff. Nothing was a problem. The best? Of course, the James Dean Suite, 1950-1953! What a sense of history. Further, the restaurant connected, Triomphe, is one of the BEST restaurants in midtown -- not just according to me, but also Zagats. It is phenomenal. If you stay here, you must try something from the menu (also does the room service).Criticisms? Two small things: If you're a regular gym goer, I'm afraid this hotel will fall short in equipment, although it has a nice sit in sauna (2 treadmills, an elliptical, a limited number of freeweights, plus a Smith rack and a lat pulldown machine). Also, the lifts, the lifts... slow, but apparently they will be rennovated after my stay there.As a tourist however, you should definitely choose this place. It's a quick walk over to Times Square, all the shows, Rockafeller Center, 5th ave designers and a little bit further to Central Park. At the end of my stay, I was sad to leave, that's how good it was.","London, United Kingdom","nycelliot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",6,5.0

Vanessa in Concierge was wonderful in assisting us prior to our stay with holding mail for my husband.The room itself was small, elegant and classic in decor. As it was just the 2 of us, there was ample room for us and our belongings. We liked the fact that the windows could open, as you cannot turn off the air conditioning and it got very stuffy in the rooms at night. One thing we did find amusing was that most of the switches in our room were put on crooked, so too were the lights in the bathroom.We did have a problem with the bed, although very comfortable, it had a very offensive odour which we worked out was coming from the underlay and from the mattress near our heads.We did request that this underlay be replaced with a new one and the mattress be turned around, but was greeted with confused silence from the front desk. This request wasn't acted on immediately and we had to withstand this horrible odour for 3 nights before it was sort of fixed.The new bar off the foyer is a great place for a drink before heading out at night and the staff in the bar were lovely and friendly.We had requested the Iroquois to arrange a car to collect us from JKF on arrival which they did organise at a rate of $160.00 which we knew was excessive , but decided to use.What we were not informed of throughout our stay but until checkout was that we had also been charged $75 as a ""waiting around fee"" as our plane was a little late in arriving and collecting our bags took a while. We were quite upset that we were never told that we would be charged this fee in the whole 9 days we spent at the hotel or that it wasn't communicated to us in the original email from the Iroquois after we had arranged the car through Alan in Concierge.When asked how much the Hotel was profitting from this charge, the concierge , Alan stammered his way though an unconvincing speech that the driver gets the whole amount whilst avoiding eye contact -I think his body action speaks for itself. I work in the travel industry and found the hotel and Alan's handling of this matter very unprofessional.We feel our stay at the Iroquois was somewhat overshaddowed by this matter and its a shame we feel that way.It is with regret that I wouldn't recommend any of my clients or friends stay at this hotel.This hotel has such enormous potential, but do need to put alot more work into it to be a world class boutique hotel",Melbourne,"Dudleydog99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",37,3.0

My business colleagues stayed at the Morgans group's Royalton across the street at the same price which although much hipper and up to date than the Iroquios was more of a scene (and a potentially noisier one at that).On the con side: - I arrived an hour earlier than check-in time so they may have rushed my room cleaning, particularly the vacuuming. When I checked into my room after 3pm, I nearly stepped on a safety pin embedded in the carpet and at a closer look found other small plastic objects in the carpet, so clearly vacuuming wasn't adequate.-I booked a wake up call which didn't happen-The bathrooms are a little tired-There was a wall safe in the room (which is a pro!) attached to an exterior wall. The door was wide open and I couldn't figure out how to close it. As it was at shin height blocking the walkway to the bathroom I had to wedge a lamp up against it to prevent injury.

Which was the night of the first big blizzard of the 2010-2011 winter. The Accomodations could have not been better. First off we were greeted by Timmy the doorman who took all our bags. Parking was a snap as there is a garage across the street. We were in walking distance to Times square and Toys r Us which was perfect for the children. The Hotel staff was pleasant and accomodating. We stayed in the Presidential suite with an adjoining room as we have 3 small children. There was a total of 3 tvs with 3 dvd players so we were all able to watch what we wanted with out fighting. There is also a wonderful selection of dvds for loan at the front desk. We felt completely warm and cozy on such a snowy cold night in New York. In the morning we awoke to a complimentary news paper outside our door. The in room snacks and mini bar was perfect for satisfying bed time snacks for the kids and us adults. Upon checkout we were greted by a Gentleman Named Robert Holmes Who Stated he was the hotel manager and asked us if we had enjoyed our stay, and I was pleased to say, yes sir we sure did. All in all The hotel and all of its staff, even down to the woman who came to turn the beds down at night were completely friendly and accomodating. In all the hotel was clean the beds were comfortable the staff was friendly. I would highly recommend staying at this hotel as I will be booking here on my next trip to NYC.","Paramus, New Jersey","tac3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paramus, New Jersey</strong>",0,5.0

So I asked Caroline at the front desk if there was any way to view this channel to see the premier. Caroline advised that she would see what she could do and check with the staff to see if any could DVR the show and provide me with a copy.

It's location is also ideal, centrally located to Times Square and 5th Avenue as well as all the other main attractions and shops!! It was our first time in NY and we were really pleased and relieved to find we could walk everywhere from the hotel, only catching the subway down to Battery Park to catch the boat to see the Statue of Liberty, and the subway was in walking distance too!Our room was a de lux room, as we wanted a little extra space, and it was perfect. The bed was really comfortable and we had TV, DVD player, ironing board, hair dryer etc! Lovely complimentary toiletries too!It was very clean, no complaints at all. There was a turn down service each evening with a chocolate to come back to.The staff were all really friendly and helpful and the concierge booked us a return limo back to the airport which was really useful, as the cost included all tolls, flat rate and tips.No complaints at all for cleanliness, location and friendliness - a lovely little gem of a hotel nestled right in the centre for access but enough away to make it quiet! Most of all.....the hot non alcoholic apple cider that you could help yourself to on your return to the hotel was absolutley lovely!! You could also have a coffee to take with you on your way out of the hotel in the morning. Both of which was a really nice touch. The apple cider is a must though!Would definately recommend this hotel to anyone, it's not one of the cheapest, but NY isn't cheap, and they're not massive rooms, but again they're not in NY anyway!

This is my first trip to New York and we realised quite early on that the location of the hotel was perfect. We negotiated a good deal via e-mail and booked about 3 months or so in advance. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by the doorman who took care of our cases straight out of the taxi and on entering the hotel we were offered a slightly larger room for $30 a night which we declined. We were located at the end of the 4th floor. The room itself was very small by hotel standards but did include all the amenities specified on the website.After the first night it was clear that either someone was smoking in the corridor or in one of the rooms on our floor and the smoke was either coming under the door or through the air conditioning. We went to reception the following morning to enquire whether the floor was solely non smoking and they advised it was but they did allow guests to smoke in the them on the 4th floor........what ????.....who was staying ont he floor the Sultan of Brunei or the president ????? Either they are non smoking or they're not. We were told that if it was ""bothering us that much"" then we could swap rooms. On the basis that it would have been a big hassle to move rooms and if we had have moved other smokers could be allowed to we declined.We ended up putting towels around the bottoms of the doors to limit the cigarette smoke.We are still in New York as we had plabbed on going to Atlantic City but the bus service was not running due to the snow. We decided not to opt for the $500+ for the additional night at the Iroquois and instead opted for the Hilton Garden Inn at Times Sqaure, where the rooms are rather larger and the reviews on trip advisor some what better.0Gregorys coffee shop across the road serves great coffees and snacks.Used the gym, although you have to call reception in advance to use the sauna. You also have to request ice as there is no ice machine....seems like a hassle to request to have the mini-bar emptied if you require use of the fridge. Why not ask in advance and let the guest decide ?Didn't use the restaurant, but did go to the Indian on 44th street towards 5th Avenue, was probably the best Indian I've had in the US, but not perfect.Pros: Great nights sleep, nice bed, good location, dvd library, free internet and printing facility in the library.Cons: The lifts are slow, they allow smoking in the non-smoking rooms/corridors, the shower was pretty poor as you had to have the tap running at the same time as the shower, bath didn't drain quick enough so showered in inches of water, toilet blocked on first day - sorted it myself. The noise from the adjoining room was very loud when they used the toilet (i presume) - my wife described it as a large boat coming into dock.From a value for money perspective I'd prefer the Hilton over the Iroquois if coming again and there's more space.....depending on what floats your boat it may be to some peoples standards, particularly smokers.",Doncaster,"Lee H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Doncaster</strong>",18,3.0

The marble bathroom was nice and well-appointed and the bed comfortable, but it made me a little crazy to even stay in the room. The lobby is beautiful, but venturing upstairs was an experience in and of itself, nevermind the room once we got there.

Eva explained that the HVAC system is somewhat antiquated and does not allow for individual room thermostat control on our particular floor. She offered to see what engineering could do, and when that wasn't enough, she personally escorted us on a tour of two other available rooms, and even helped us move to one of them, before we finally decided to go back to our original room (we're not usually so difficult). The room cooled down a bit and was just fine.

I’ve stayed in the past and enjoyed the passable, quaint rooms of yesteryear – if you like the polished mahogany feel of a New York club in the MadMen era, you’ll go for the décor and feel of the public spaces of the Iroquois. And, as I have in the past, you’ll likely receive a smallish, intimate room which is functionally challenged, but clean and satisfactory in all other ways.But I was coming in only for one night, to meet with clients around the corner, and I guess it was my misfortune to snag a very attractive nonrefundable web advance sale price for an “Executive King” room. Look at their room descriptions, and note that this room classification is at the top of the one-room line, just below the suites.Now look at the attached picture to see what I got! A low-floor dungeon room overlooking the internal court, which at that level is full of horrific vistas of office toilers and HVAC engineering. Oh, and there’s the dilapidated fire escape for a bit of local color. You’ll see others comment on the antiquated heating/cooling system – that means if you want anything but closed window heat stoking in November, you get to open the window onto the fire escape (strangely, it opens fully) and hear the courtyard noise with the added audible treat of taxi and ambulance/fire engine siren sounds reverberating around and into your room. This room also had the good fortune of being sandwiched next to the elevator and a (often-used) utility closet.Yes, I asked for another room and was told the hotel was sold out for the night.What to do? I dunno; ask for a specific room confirmation before clicking on your internet booking: good luck.

It was the perfect place! Listed as a Small Luxury Hotel, it is central to many midtown attractions: Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue, Times Square, the Theatre District, Empire State Bldg., etc. and we were able to walk to many of our midtown destinations. While the room was small (typical for midtown NYC), it was clean, comfy and QUIET. The staff was very nice/helpful. After calling 10 other hotels, I had despaired of finding nice, reasonably priced accommodations for this busy weekend. The Iroquois was a happy surprise for us: we found this hotel was priced moderately, especially compared to its Hotel Row neighbors on 44th Street, and elegant in an understated way.The Iroquois is a gem of a classic NYC hotel - we will definitely come back!",New Jersey,"lynmagic</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Jersey</strong>",0,5.0

Once again we booked a classic room ( 2 double beds) and requested a quiet, non smoking room and we were allocated a room at the back of the hotel. Whilst there was no view, it was a peaceful place to escape to for some rest. We couldn't hear any traffic or other guests and the only noise was the feint humm of the air conditioning unit. This didn't bother me at all and I am a light sleeper but I would recommend ear plugs for anyone who may be sensitive to this sort of noise.The room was comfortable and clean. It is small, but then I expected that. If you bring a lot of luggage be prepared for it to get in the way, there really isn't room for lots of cases! The bathroom was windowless but clean and we were given fresh towels each day. The shower was lovely and hot and had an excellent flow.The hotel has a turn down service and provide the weather forecast for the next day. Very handy when you are planning what to see and do.We didn't eat at the hotel so I cannot comment on that. We used the Red Flame Diner down the road which was excellent as always. A varied and plentiful menu, quick service and good value.The library at the hotel is another benefit. Two computers with free internet use and a printer. Perfect for checking email, updating Facebook!!, planning activities and checking in for the return flight home. There only used to be one computer and sometimes we would experience a small wait, but now there are two, you can pretty much find one free at anytime.The staff were friendly and helpful and the doorman was able to hail us a cab for our return to the airport. He did recommend the hotel car service (fixed fee of $65) but we preferred to take a licensed yellow cab. This cost $45 plus toll and tip (total around $60).

Hotel is very accomodating with regards to our request of having a room in the higher floors, refrigerator in the room and a late check-out. The cleaning staffs are particularly recommendable. The hotel has a system on tipping wherein they leave envelope in the room for you to put your tip. There were 2 incidents when they must've forgotten to leave the envelope therefore, we put the money on the dressing table but we found it still there when we got back. Size of the room is big enough to walk around comfortably even with luggage lying around. The air condition is a little loud but did'nt hinder us from having a good sleep with the cozy bed and pillows and Frette linens. The free morning coffee and evening apple cider was a blessing especially during cold days. We had the bed and breakfast package which we regretted because the continental breakfast took forever to be served and choices are limited. Besides, there's a diner just few doors down the hotel which gives you value for your money and more choices too but get there early on weekends because the place fills up quickly. But dinner at Triomphe Restaurant (same place where they serve breakfast) is a different matter, the ambience, the service and the food is excellent all the way.

However, on balance our weekend stay was disappointing.The good:LocationFrette linensChocolates and welcome wineComplimentary coffee and fruit flavored water in the lobbyThe bad:When we arrived it was raining, and there was nobody in front to help us with our bags. In fact, the bellman from the next door hotel, The City Club, took the bags out of the cab for us. Then, we just carried our own bags up the stairs into the hotel as we did not want to wait outside in the rain for a bellman. Windows do not have sound proofing....on fifth floor over 44 St. lots of horns, sirens and early morning garbage truck pickup noise.Our deluxe room for over $400 per night was really small and claustrophobic as was the bathroom. The tub had mold around the edge, not a pretty sight. Other hotels we have stayed at in the 4 star category such as The Michelangelo, London, NYC and the Regency offer larger rooms in the deluxe category for a similar price.But, my biggest gripe was the negative interaction we had with the check in staff, particularly Alex. When we arrived at 3 pm to check in, our room was not ready. Since check in time is 3 pm, we asked if we could please have another room since ours was not ready. We were told that they were full, and there were no other rooms. We were told that the previous guests in our room #504 had just checked out at 2:30 and the housekeepers were just now cleaning it. My husband said ""If check in time is 3:00 and the room was blocked out for us, why did these guests leave at 2:30. Alex said they had a late checkout and were late leaving the room. My husband said that if the room was blocked out why would they be given a late check out and Alex said ""Do you think we should never give anyone a late check out? Would you have us kick these guests out?"" This was not the point! His answer was certainly not apologetic and actually quite rude. The room was ready about 25 minutes later....not such a big deal, but they did not handle this in a professional nor cordial manner.I am a retired travel agent, and I could never recommend this hotel to friends or clients.","coral gables, fl","glsebs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>coral gables, fl</strong>",50,2.0

When I called two weeks later to ask for a receipt copy, they remembered the details of my work in NY and faxed the receipt within minutes.The room and bath were completely refurbished, comfortable, and quiet, though a tad small if you had two people staying. My room service breakfast came just on time, based on my requiest the previous evening. It was more than ample, with a huge bowl of ceral, fresh fruit, and giant bagle. The Iroquois' location is superb, just a few blocks from MOMA and all of the delights of 5th Avenue. My business meeting was near the East River, about a mile and a half away, and an easy cab ride. Do allow extra time, however, if you are in that part of town when the UN General Assembly is in session, as it was when I visited. Gridlock does occur!After my business meeting, I had an entire afternoon to roam the city. When I returned, I settled in the hotel's cozy library to check my flight on the computers and print out my boarding pass. I then settled down to read the paper until my airport limo arrived.My only complaint was that the room AC could not be controlled by the guest, but the bellman came up and closed the vents so that cold air would not circulate all night.","Louisville, Kentucky","derbyfanbap</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Louisville, Kentucky</strong>",0,5.0

It was expensive at around $300 per night, but that's what you get for booking at the 11th hour!First impressions are good - location is perfect for midtown, sandwiched between the Algonquin and the Sofitel on 44th Street, barely a block from Times Square. The small, compact reception is more reminiscent of a European boutique hotel,and service is of the usual standard you'd expect at this level of hotel.Room 1002 seemed fairly typical of most rooms in the hotel - first and foremost, they are tiny! Even by European standards this was small - not a problem for a solo business traveller, but I would have enjoyed it a lot less had I been there with my wife. The large walk-in closet helps though, as it provides plenty of room to store clothing and luggage out of the way. Big TV, DVD player and iPod dock were all good, the desk was small but functional. The free in-room WiFi was quick to access and 100% reliable during my 3-day stay. Furnishings and extras are all of good quality. Morning coffee in reception and iced water in the evenings was a nice touch.There are always a few gripes, which I'll list here:- although there are 2 elevators, one goes so slowly it's almost in reverse. During the morning rush, it could take a long time to get up and down the floors- the lack of visible staff late at night was unusual, and I did wonder what would stop one of midtown's less salubrious residents from pitching up for the night in the lobby. Didn't see any problems though.- no fridge was provided in the room - a tray of room-temperature minibar products were on the counter and a fridge had to be requested if required. Why??Overall though, nothing that would put me off staying again.

The room was maintained beautifully during our stay both during the day and also in the evening turn down service.In the hotel itself, you can use the complementary internet and printing facilities (very handy for last minute trip research and return flight on-line check in) and free coffee is provided in the morning, with iced-water provided in the afternoon (very welcome in the August heat).The friendliness from the staff continued throughout our stay - from hello/goodnight's from reception, to information from the concierge and bellman which made us feel right at home.The location of the hotel is superb, a couple of blocks from times square in one direction and grand central station in the other, which left us free to visit a number of the main sites very easily from our hotel.I would wholeheartedly recommend the Iroquois without hesitation for anyone visiting New York, and it will be top of my list when booking a return trip.","Warrington, United Kingdom","RachaelApplegate</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Warrington, United Kingdom</strong>",59,5.0

We stayed in a deluxe King room on the 7th floor facing a court yard and another building. The room was small but very nicely decorated and very elegant. The bed was very comfortable and gave us a great night sleep. We really enjoyed having the black out shades so we could sleep in as long as we wanted. The room AC did not keep the room as cold as we like but is was comfortable. The bath room is quite small and only has room for one person to get ready, but it has great gold fixtures and classy tile. To be honest the smallness really is not a big deal. The room has a large flat screen TV and DVD player, you can even check out DVDs from the front desk for free. Overall we really enjoyed the room. The hotel does not have ice machines in the hallway so you have to call room service for a bucket of ice, this was some what of a pain but it is managable. The front desk staff was very friendly and attentive to our needs and the conceriage was the best. We even called them from lower Manhattan to get help finding a bank and they were more than willing to help us out.Overall we had a great stay and really enjoyed the hotel. Also, if you want coffee in the morning there is a great coffee shop across the street called Gregory's, this will save you a 1-2 block walk to Starbucks and to be honest it was better coffee.",Seattle,"dking911</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle</strong>",1,4.0

However, when I arrived and mentioned the ambassador's name, no one knew who I was talking about. I travel to NYC once a month and am used to the early check in process and the availablity. The front desk staff were curt, rude, and unaccomodating. They do not understand the concept of ""estimated time"" and seemed upset that I requested one. When I finally did receive a room, I was placed directly across from an elevator, which I specifically requested not to be. The air conditioner in the room was broken, so I was immediately moved to another room, right across from the elevator, again. When I mentioned the heat in the new room, I was told this is typical of the rooms, and had to request a portable fan be brought in. Even this did not help the uncomfortable temperature of the room. Nor did the engineer, who did not know how to properly work the air conditioner. As I was lying in bed, a hotel employee knocked on the door, did not wait for an answer, and proceeded to let himself in. The fixtures in the shower and lack of ease were a clear indication that this hotel needs to be updated. There are always great deals for hotels, but I would gladly spend the extra money for a hotel that provides a nice experience.

I usually stay at The Warwick (which I love) but wanted to be closer to theaters as my daughter and I were going to four shows over the weekend. I recently stayed at the nearby The Muse (and liked it) but decided to try The Iroquois based on recommendations from TA. BAD DECISION!!! The Iroquois is my first BAD hotel experience in NYC after years of visits. My initial reaction to the hotel was disappointment - small lobby area, excrutiatingly slow elevators, and a miniscule room with virtually no daylight. I've heard about NYC hotel rooms like this but have never actually stayed in one before. I thought about upgrading our room but I found the hotel so depressing and uninviting that I knew we would spend as little time as possible in it so decided against it. Indeed, we left the hotel early each morning and returned late each night. But that was still too much time spent at the hotel as I woke up covered in clusters of red raised bites. I showed the hotel manager the bites and she immediately moved us to an upgraded room and assured me the hotel would investigate. A different hotel manager called me on my cell after I had checked out to inform me that the room was checked for bedbugs and the report was negative. He suggested that the bites might be mosquito bites but I told him that they were definitely not mosquito bites - the location, pattern and symptoms of the bites are most consistent with flea bites but could also be spider bites. He called me a few minutes later to say that he would comp one nights stay on my credit card (which he did but only the room rate and not the taxes).I did not make a fuss about the bites other than requesting a new bed. The hotel management took the bites seriously, were very apologetic and responded quickly. However, despite their response, I will not stay at The Iroquois again as I've stayed at nicer midtown hotels which do not have bugs. The last thing I want to deal with during a short visit to NYC is getting bitten by bugs in a hotel bed!!!

I went back out to the desk to speak with the very polite and courteous receptionist, who told me that they had a room for me. The bellman who accompanied me to my room was also very nice and attentive. I wasn't aware of it until we arrived at my room, but since the hotel was full they gave me a huge suite complete with living room, dining room, and kitchen.

While I have stayed at five star hotels that are much more plush for the same price, I think the nightly rate is comparable for a good location in New York. The hotel is only a couple of blocks from Times Square and all the theaters on Broadway. I was so close that I was able to walk to both dinner and the event (in heels) without paying a cab fare. That alone is worth a lot in my opinion. The bed was also wonderfully comfortable, and I appreciated the iPhone dock in the bedroom for charging my phone. The following day, my breakfast was delivered promptly at 7:00am as requested, and the bellman arranged for a flat-fee town car to take me to the airport (during rush hour). Everything from check-in to check-out went very smoothly, and all of the employees I encountered were extremely courteous. Customer service is the number one reason I will return to The Iroquois. I only hope to be able to stay longer next time!I am truly appreciative to The Iroquois for the accommodation and kind treatment, and have resolved to stay there again on my next visit to NYC.",Tennessee,"MNinTN</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tennessee</strong>",9,5.0

The hotel exceeded expectations at every step. This was our third trip to the Big Apple and each time we have stayed at notable hotels, so we had high expectations, The Iroquois delivered on each one. We had a quiet, secluded room on the 8th floor...an important consideration for Manhattan!From the luxury bathrobes and Molten Brown bath items to the little freebees like the New York Times and coffee / citrus water, we were made to feel like royalty each day. Our free internet access was excellent, despite what others had noted, so we appreciated the ability to keep our friends and family updated on our trip each night. As with anything in Manhattan, the consideration must be ""location, location, location"" and the Iroquois was by far the best situated hotel we have stayed in to date. We were able to walk to many locations with ease including Rockefeller Center, Macy's, Grand Central, and even Central Park, saving lots of $$$ in cab fares.

I am disappointed with the hotel for a number of reasons. Firstly I emailed them in advance and told them it was our honeymoon, so I was expecting a bottle of wine or flowers or some fruit in the room, but we received no acknowledgment when we registered, nor any nice touches. The room was 509 – which was at the back. I will start with the cons – sleeping was difficult because we were close to all the air conditioning units so they were noisy (even with ear plugs). It was dark and the lighting was appalling. You literally had to go around to each light to turn them on with no overhead light or central switch, we found it really difficult to turn off the bedside lamps so I unplugged mine each night. The lighting was so bad that I couldn’t find anywhere to plug in the hairdryer and had to climb under the desk to unplug things. I later spotted a plug on the other wall! The furniture is too big for the room and a writing desk/chair is not needed. You can’t turn off the air con/heating it’s always on, but maybe that’s an American feature? The pros – the bed was great – new and very comfortable. The room was very clean and the location is a few blocks from everything. From Times Square, Grand Central Station, the subway, Bryant Park, oh and there’s a diner a few doors away which is great for breakfast. Free internet usage & water in reception was great too as our phones didn’t work and we had to make arrangements with various people. At Bryant Park there’s a lovely organic café called Le Pain Quotidien which had the best coffee (it’s hard to get a decent coffee in NY!) and delicious food.","Dublin, Ireland","maurajy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",0,3.0

The room was ok, maybe bit small, but hey it's NY. What put me off most of all was the dust on the mirror lamp in the bathroom, it seemed like it wasn't cleaned for at least a few months. They did clean it after I mentioned it, but still... Another thing I didn't like was the lack of doormen, most of the time there was nobody there. Nobody really showed any interest which would have been nice when we arrived with our cases.Oh and the elevators are slow and often busy.On the plus side, we had a nice dutch girl at reception who treated us really nice.The location is really good and the bed was good and free WIFI, which is a very good plus I think.All in all, it was a bit disapointing.

We chose The Iroquois because of its position and the reviews said the beds were comfortable, very important to me! Well our king size bed did not dissapoint, 6'6'' wide, loads of pillows, top quality bed linen, and REALLY comfortable, the manager told us the beds had a 15 year guarantee and were currently 3 years old. Our suite consisted of a lounge with corner sofa, desk, occasional chairs, coffee tables, lamps, fridge, flat screen TV on a chest. The furnishing was traditional with modern accents, all in excellent condition and very spacious. There was a door leading to an equally spacious bedroom with huge bed, chaise lounge, flat screen TV on a chest of drawers, built in cupboard, lamps etc everything you could want and all very tasteful. The bathroom was quite small and contained a short but very deep jaccuzi type bath, seperate large shower cubicle with an oh so powerful shower, basin and WC. The taps were gold coloured ( not my taste) but the floor and walls were a neutral marble and very attractive. We had 4 phones in the suite. My daughter joined us for a 3 nights and slept well on the sofa which converted into a 5' double bed. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff, who greeted us warmly and seemed genuinely interested in making sure our stay did not dissapoint. The free wireless internet worked well, and there was a computer and printer for guests free use in the Library. We had the continental breakfast which was included in our rate and again it was all we could have wanted. The position close to Times Square but on a quiet side street is brilliant, with loads of bars and resturants really close by. The Iroquis was never tatty, there was no chipped paint, grubby fabrics, or stained rugs, it was really well cared for and we loved it.

The Iroquois is truly a rare, boutique hotel, with exquisite touches, service and amenities. My friend and I stayed for 4 nights - we arrived on St. Patrick's Day. Even though we arrived early in the morning, the very friendly gentleman at the front desk allowed us to check-in immediately. Our room was on the top floor, tucked away in the back, so street noise was very minimal...yet the open windows provided lots of fresh air and natural light.

The crisp sheets, coomfy mattress, luxurious robes, doorbell (we were so impressed we pressed it many times) - and the Molton Brown toiletties absolutely spa quality.The service - every staff member was very friendly and extremely helpful. Even when I came back from my run each afternoon (and looked like I didn't belong in such a fine hotel), the doorman, front desk personnel, all greeted me with warm, friendly smiles. The price - being from Canada, we were fortunate that the Canadian dollar has been relatively strong of late. The price we paid was comparable to a 3-star hotel in midtown Manhattan. It may have been we booked relatively early...but throughout our research on hotels, the Iroquois provided the best deal - and given the luxurious, high quality of this hotel, I say we got an amazing deal.Without any hesitation, I would recommend this hotel to all my family and friends.

The staff was very friendly and helped out with questions when they could (especially Nick the Congierge was a big help). The room was clean and tidy, not too big but then we didnt plan to stay in the room much except to sleep. We had booked the standard room with 2 double beds which is also suitable for couple (just use one bed as it's big enough for English standards). All facilities were working, and turn down service (with chocolate!) was much appreciated. The location is superb, between 5th and 6th avenue and close to Times Square. Extremely touristic but with good access to all sightseeing points. There is a restaurant next door but it was a little noisy and you needed a reservation so we did not eat here. The bar is nice though but closed on Sundays. There is a business centre where you can use the internet for free (they have 2 computers) and wi-fi in the room is also available at no charge. There is also a fitness centre but I didnt try this so I cant comment on that. We had room 408 on the very end, and the view was awful but then the building is in the middle of the street so unless you're on the top floor, the view would have been of other buildings anyway. The only thing that was a little annoying was that there was some sort of fan or airconditioning outside the window (not sure if this belonged to the hotel or the adjacent building) which was a little noisy at night. Nothing that was majorly disturbing but the bathroom was quieter than the bedroom at times.

The Iroquois fit the bill on both counts and I am grateful to the staff in this hotel for making our stay so enjoyable.We received an upgrade and a fruit platter on arrival-( which was a pleasant surprise and a nice touch for that 'special feel') Our room was a good size for a city hotel with plenty of storage space and a good size desk. The bathroom was well layed out with plenty of towels and a nice selection of Molton Brown toiletries (I had read alot of reviews about other hotels and one of the points seems to be around shower pressure - so I will be clear and say that the shower pressure was always very good in our room).The room and hotel as a whole was always very clean and well maintained - even when we left the 'do not disturb 'sign on - they left a very nice note to explain why thye hadn't been in and were able to send someone straight away- despite it being early evening by the time we got back. The bed was very comfortable as mentioned in other reviews.The location from our 'close to Times Square criteria' could not have been better - (The middle of Times Square is less than a 5 minute walk away). The Iroquois location was perfect for us and at no time did I feel unsafe walking around in the area.We did not eat in the Hotel but I will assume that the food and service would have been equal to the rest of our experience in the hotel. Anyone who has read other Iroquois reviews would have read about the 'Red Flame Diner' - I can only reiterate that this place was perfect for breakfast and any other dining requirements you might have.The gym and sauna was perfect for the short workout with a good running machine, cross-trainer and a selection of free weights to burn off any excess calories you hadn't already walked off. Again there were nice little touches here -fresh towels - TV - water fountain.The other nice touches were the computers in the reading room connected to a printer (useful when doing on-line check-in) and the hotel umbrellas available in your room or readily from the door man when it was raining.If I had to suggest one area for improvement it would be the need for Tea and Coffee making facilities in the room - though there was coffee available free from the lobby in the morning...it was the need for coffee on Sunday night when the coffee shop across the road was closed and room service was just too much trouble and a bit too pricey for Coffee on its own.On the whole this was a perfect hotel for us - and if like me you have read lots of reviews to find the right one for your stay - Take a chance at the Iroquois as I feel it fully desreves it's listing under 'Small Luxury Hotels' of the world and I hope you will have the same great experience we have had.I would like to thank the staff at the Iroquois for making our first trip to NYC 'special' and look forward to staying there on our next visit.",Cardiff,"Johnboy1402</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cardiff</strong>",17,5.0

We were in the city to take in holiday sites and shop so the Iroquois's location was perfect. I had searched for a Times Square area hotel in hopes of a room with a view, but was so thankful I had decided on the Iroquois without the hustle and bustle of the city just outside. The room was quiet which is unbelievable for a city hotel! Parking was also easy and the front desk held our bags both at check-in and check-out.

The offerings of fresh croissants, toasted bagels, granola, yogurt, fresh fruit and smoked salmon and cheeses pleased everyone.Because the location is central to all we wanted to do, we did spend a bit of relaxation time in our suite. Staying at the Iroquois means you can shop 5th Avenue to Central Park, and return to rest before dinner and evening activities. It made for a nice break in a busy day.

It was so nice to speak with an in-house reservationist when booking so I certainly was able to arrange lodging as I wanted it - no compromises had to be made in booking the 2 bedroom suite I had requested. Check-in and check-out were flawless. We especially liked Nick, the concierge, who suggested fabulous restaurants within an easy walk.

It's a great location, out of the way and quaint, yet just a very short walk from everything.We had a standard king room and found the room size quite decent after reading how small NYC hotel rooms can be -- and honestly, if you're hanging out in your room while in NYC your doing it all wrong anyways -- just stay home. ;)The hotel including our room was impeccable, the staff was very helpful, and the amenities were great. There is a great little hometown bar across the street and down the block 100 yards for when you just want to grab a nightcap -- this is where employees in the area go, cheap drinks & great people. We could have also had the nightcap at the bar in the hotel but wanted to mingle with the locals a little and got to do that which was great.Only improvements I would make: (1) the high speed internet was a little spotty in the evening and (2) when you want ice you have to call the front desk. I assume it's because they don't want to waste the space for an ice machine room on each floor -- no big deal really, just kind of odd if you are used to staying in chain hotels.We would (and will) stay at the Iroquois again.

The Iroquois is a small luxury hotel which is privately owned conveniently located for Times Square and the shopping in 5th Avenue. I was impressed by the location between 5th and 6th Avenues since you don't feel like you are entering a bussling environment the moment you step out of the hotel. It is very close but has that classy distance so you feel like you are staying in NY but aren't actually in NY.The residents of the hotel tend to be well heeled and well dressed who have travelled to NY a few times before and would like to see Broadway Shows and stroll down 5th Avenue. There aren't that many jeans and sneakers residents, saying that it is not at all pretention but you can tell people sneaking a look at your shoes when they see you in the elevator.The hotel is a favourite for single travellers, especially female since it has a safe feel about it and thankfully no business travellers. Check-in for me was very smooth and the room although small was not small by NY standards.I took great pleasure in seeing the reassuring Molton Brown products which were generously replenished daily. There are robes and towels and interestingly a dvd player, you can get dvds from reception free of charge which is a nice touch.There was a little office table in my room and no problem with the free wireless, the free wireless was an important freebie for me. For those not bringing their own laptop there are two terminals in the downstairs library area, there was not a queue for the terminals and owing to the class of people here they were just on and off the machines. Beds were comfortable, no problem sleeping.The reception area has free coffee till about 10am and then hot apple cider which was wonderful. I didn't personally use the restaurant here but I suspect it was good quality.Staff are very friendly but give you your space and are always willing to look into for example opening hours for a shop for you. There is also a dedicated concierge.For me this place was perfect, had I been travelling on business I may have preferred a place like the London NYC for the simple fact that it has an impressive entrance and obvious space for coffee and meetings. However, this is a different animal completely and caters for people who are not travelling with an expenses budget.As for issues, the only issue I can see is only having 2 elevators, not a problem if you are on the lower floors since there is a staircase and I can't say this proved an problem for me.Overall I would recommend this hotel to you should you wish to spend a few days in a charming little hotel!","London, United Kingdom","avelautham</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",61,5.0

The Frette linens, bathrobes and slippers were lovely and the huge bed was like sleeping on a cloud!

The great free coffee every morning was just the thing to start us off before exploring the city. Our room was quiet ,spacious and extremely clean and luxurious.

The quick summary is that while there was nothing wrong with the hotel, it was nothing I'd get excited about. On the upside, the location is very good, there is little outside / street noise in the rooms (a blessing in this busy part of Manhattan), the rooms are clean, the beds comfortable, and the bathrooms good - and the free shoe shine service is a nice touch. However, the service was distinctly indifferent from check-in to check-out, the lifts slow slow slow, the decor of the rooms a bit old-fashioned and tired, the breakfast (in-room) very disappointing and a rip-off of at $15 which turns into $28 once you throw in tip, room delivery and tax, and details were off (such as the iron in my room which was rusty and which stained a shirt). All in, I'm sure there are much better hotels at the same price range - I've stayed at the Giraffe and think that's better, and next time will probably try the Sofitel next door.

Decided to try the Iroquois b/c I had a corporate rate. the location is very good and the trip advisor reviews were generally good. I was told at time of booking the corporate rate was Run of House and that ""we would receive the best room available"". this translated into what must have been the worst room in the hotel (room 307). It was TINY (about 2 feet larger around than the bed) and at the back, the windows faced right into the fire escape, with the next building very close. It was really horrible. We phoned to the front desk and they said they would move us, we moved to a much nicer room (rm. 1100), still fairly small, but it had a bay window and a beautiful view of the Chrystler building. So if they told me on the phone I was entitled to the best room available, why did they give me the worst room?They make a big deal of their turn-down service with chocolates. We got this the first night. Teh second night it wasnt done. Immediately we checked to see if our ""do not disturb"" sign was on - it wasn't. It had been in the afternoon, but we tuned it off about 5:30 or 6pm. So either they just didnt do it or they tried to turn down our room before 6pm.I was very surprised the room had no coffee/tea making facilities. I drink tea and my partner drinks coffee. They had a coffee urn in the lobby in the mornings, no tea at any time, so we had to visit the coffee shop down the street.The last morning we had breakfast in the hotel. We chose the self-serve buffet choice. They added a compulsory 18% tip to the bill and still added a line to the bill for us to add a tip. 18% tip for self-serve and they were looking for more? I found that a bit offensive.As we left the bellhop asked how we were getting to the airport, we told him we were taking the skytrain to Newark. He tried to talk us out of it and to let him call us a car service, giving us all sorts of incorrect reasons not to take the skytrain (including that it took over an hour, that we would be hampered by subway repairs, etc - actually it is the fastest, lest expensive way to Newark and dosent have anything to do with the subway.)

We drank the ""free"" sparkling water left for us and bought drinks and snacks down at the local drugstore in Times Square to bring back to the hotel.

If you are going to eat at their restaurant for breakfast, the food is good, but go for the ""breakfast bar"". Don't go for the crepes. Far too drenched in syrup and nothing else with it - I think the berries had been frozen - I was not impressed. Not much to go on for the day. The coffee was good. A great little diner just down the street (on the way to Times Square) was very ""New York"" and had great All American food at a very reasonable price. Sorry I can't remember the name of it. One thing is for sure, there is plenty of food in NY - sure glad I was able to walk all over the city to burn off the calories!Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this fine hotel.

The staff was incredibly attentive from the beginning, from the doorway to the rooms. Our second night we had an unexpected visitor from out of town and we asked for a roll-away bed in our room. Instead, they upgraded us to the James Dean Suite and promptly had our luggage delivered. Bill, the bellman, was very sweet and helpful, offering wonderful local knowledge about restaurants, hot spots and personal memories of growing up in New York. Caroline, one of the front desk attendants, promptly helped us with our many needs in a polite and efficient manner.

I'll get to the point:Rooms - we stayed in a Classic with 2 double beds. Beds were comfy with lots of feather pillows. I prefer foam, but it was late & didn't bother to ask if they had that. Bed & bath linens were soft, comfy & plush. 2 spa slippers & 1 bath robe provided (nope, it stays with the hotel). Room & bathroom were very clean & with upgraded furniture, fixtures & tile. There was a good size safe in the closet. Flat screen TV, robobar (touch 1 item & it automatically charges, whether or not you took it out, so don't attempt to use this as a fridge). Pack & play was *free* for my toddler. We were told small fridge was also free, but it was not available for the 2 nights we were there. Turndown service with chocolates left on your pillow (they were good too). Our room was towards the back corner of the bldg, window had the fire escape stairs & faced the side windows of the bldg next door. At first, we were disappointed with no view, but upon coming back at 1 pm, found out we were fortunate as the garbage trucks came loudly in the wee hours of the morning, & the honking of the morning buslte was not something we'd like to wake up to so very early in the morning during vacation.Kids - we have 2 boys, 8 & 2 y.o.; hotel has a kids amenities package that is again *free*. Just request it. Kids got a small cookie & fruit plate, a bathrobe & slippers (though it was adult size), a full size bottle of bubble bath (they got Disney Cars), & a pamphlet for NYC attractions for kids.Internet - worked well for us, but then again we used it after midnight so may not be a lot of folks online.Parking - across the street from the hotel (Hippodrome). We were told it was $34.00 for 24 hours (don't know if tax incl) as long as you have it stamped by the hotel, but no in-out priviledge (we didn't use this). Parking garage had an overnight special of $10.00 if you come in after a certain time & it's good for 12 hours. My hubby still wanted his parking tkt stamped & we paid $9.00 (this is a steal in NYC!), still a $1 discount which went to the parking valet guy. By the way, we have a Honda minivan & parking garages typically charge extra for taller/longer vehicles, so the parking price was definitely a steal! At lunch time, we discovered that the parking meters & places I used to park at years ago are long gone, so we paid $20.00 for 1 hour at a parking garage near Madison & Grand Central, but still cheaper than getting your car towed.Lost & found - not so good part. We thought we left someone important for our toddler & called 4 times Monday, the housekeeper took my info & asked me to call back in 15 minutes. Got stuck at work & couldn't call for another hour, another housekeeper told me to call back again, called again left a voicemail with details & call back info. Tuesday, houseman took my item & contact info & said he will have supv call as lost & found items are locked in the office, didn't hear from anyone. Wednesday, called & asked to speak to the hskp supv to whom I explained my several attempts of getting in touch with Lost & Found, & who again took my info, said she'll check & call me back. After 3 hours, I called again & spoke to the same hskp supv who said they didn't find anything. I asked why she didn't call me back & she said she was busy, no apologies. I replied that I wished she had called me back, that would just be good customer service after all my attempts to call for the past 3 days. I believe that customer service should be extended to the guest even after they've checked out. For this, I took 1 star off.Other than that, we liked this hotel & would stay again.

My room was quite comfortable - clean, well appointed...neither new nor worn - and the electronics were modern and functioned well, but for me - on a business trip - it was one massive hassle to have to suffer through three days during which the wireless Internet didn't work for hours on end. The hotel staff forwarded me to their Internet provider who during an hour on the phone tried to solve the problem, but the outage remained and the result was hours of wasted time - call after call to fix the problem - when I had wanted to work in my room. To their credit, I was not charged for incidentals to compensate for the inconvenience.

A lot of people have said the rooms are small....that may be as compared to other regions outside of Manhattan, but it was plenty big enough for us. The diner down the street is a good place to eat. We would definitely stay here again. Parking is in the garage on the right just before you get to the Iroquois, and is about $30 a night if you stay at the hotel. It's about $50 without the hotel validating it. We got a great rate on the room, under 175 a night on Thu, Fri, Sat nights during the 4th.",Tennessee,"Joaks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tennessee</strong>",34,5.0

We got married while we were out there. Couldn't fault the location and would only stay there again based on that. Rooms were clean but felt the service was below standard. The bell boys and cleaners were really friendly but the reception staff sometimes weren't very much so. Got quite excited hearing about peoples free upgrades and complimentary bottles of wine for birthday etc, but we got nothing, not even a smile whilst waiting for our limo to take us to our wedding ceremony. Rest of the wedding party had to wait two hours when they checked in as their rooms weren't ready and had to wait an hour for some ice, and that only arrived after two more calls down to reception. The room manual said that children get a bubble bath of their choice and a tote bag with colouring things in but we never got either, even though we asked reception twice. As I said, we'd only stayed there again because of the location and if a good deal came up. You don't spend a lot of time in your room to be honest.

The room was smallish with no real view to speak of. The service for ice always was brought quickly - we asked for a small bar fridge and used that to cool fruit and water. Trivial quibblings - two slower elevators - though we rarely waited long and a small closet. Great coffee and iced tea free in the lobby. The staff was always pleasant and helpful. We did not eat in the hotel. The first day here we bought a hop on, hop off 48 hour bus pass which worked well for us - we used the downtown and up town tours to get around on the longer routes. The busses come often - we never seemed to be waiting. We are avid walkers and walked most everywhere from the hotel, from Macy's to Sak's to Sardi's, to our play and around Times Square in the evening hunting for a place to eat. I walked out of a well known chain restaurant in Times Square because food and drink prices were not provided in the menu - we noticed this a couple of times - though smaller places seem to be more sensible.

Rooms were clean but the hotel and room shows its age. Rough spots in the arm chair and corners of walls. Hotel elevator is terribly slow and there are only two. Bathroom and bedroom was small but that's expected in most New York hotels. I had a rough experience with the check in staff. The lady who checked me in was clearly foreign so I had trouble understanding her. After a long trip to New York I wasn't very patient. Rooms are dimly lit--only lamps no ceiling lights. There aren't enough outlets here especially when you have electronics like a laptop, cellphone, ipod etc.The Good: The price is reasonable for New York. Maid service was good in cleaning and provided fresh towels every day. For kids, the hotel has a bunch of DVDs for rent that you can use in the DVD player they provide. Free wireless internet was wonderful and fast. There was a computer and printer in the small hotel library which was good for printing out boarding passes. The bell hop and desk staff were generally friendly except the lady mentioned above. The beds were very comfortable as were the sheets. I had a 6:30 pm flight but there is a luggage storage room that the hotel provides which was very helpful because they have a 12pm check out time. The halls are nice and quiet at night and during the day making it a perfect place to relax after a long day in the city. The location is very good. Close to Times Square, 5th Avenue, Bryant Park and the New York Public Library and Rockefeller Center. The B,D,F,V train is close by at 42nd street and 6th Avenue. If you want a cab, it's reasonable going from 44th street to anywhere. I went to the Upper East Side at 96th street for under $10 and the same when I went to Greenwich Village. I did not try the hotel's restaurant, Triomphe, or room service. From my walks around the area I didn't find a lot of restaurants. There isn't as many as in Greenwich Village or the Upper West Side, so count on leaving the area for lunch or dinner. I would come back to the Iroquois for my next trip. Reasonable price. Clean and comfortable room. What more could you ask for in a New York hotel?

Couldn't have asked for anything better, 1.5 blocks from Times Square, literally a 5 minute walk. A lovely street just far enough away from the hustle and bustle.The Red Flame diner is a few doors down and like many have said in reviews it really is the best diner for breakfast. We went there most mornings before we set off for our day.HOTELFree internet access in the reception which we never had to que for. Recepetion were helpful and helped with any requests we had. Always said good morning etc.Our room was small but we were expecting this as everyone says it, small really is small!There was no view, unless you love walls! on our first morning we walked past an open room that was being cleaned and looked much bigger and brighter so we asked the maid if we could move! Recpetion said it was no problem and would be a little extra for the week, we were happy to pay this, we moved everything over and were much happier.The size of the room really isn't important as you are up and out so early and back late it really is just somewhere to sleep. The toiletries were lovely, molton brown and were replenished daily as were towels.We had no complaints.Getting around.New York is so easy to get around, we were so surprised. We had booked a tour with Real New York Tours thinking we'd never find anything but this tour wasn't until our 3rd day. To our surprise in our first couple of days we'd done miles and found it so easy we were worried we'd wasted money on a tour.ToursFor people thinking of booking Real New Tours or one similar my advice is to book this at the beginning of your stay ie day 1 or 2. Any later and i don't think it's worth the money. Ours was a half day and yes it was really interesting and the guide was lovely but we could have done it on our own in hindsight. She did take us to Harlem which we wouldn't have done on our own and took me to Carrie's house :0 ) which again, i wouldn't have found on my own! Just book it for your first days there.Things to do.1.WTC Museum WorkshopGo. Worth every penny. Extremely moving. Would highly recommend. 12/102.Ellis islandReally enjoyed, more than we thought actually. Don't do the statue of liberty as a seperate trip unless you really want to get off and climb it, the boat to Ellis stops to let people off at Liberty Island so you get a really good look and plenty of photo opps. The boat goes right round too so in my opinion not worth the extra ££3.Empire StateWorth doing, wanted to do it to say we'd done it, view was well worth the que!4.Chelsea MarketReally liked it hear, smaller than i thought it was. Stop for chinese, lovely.5.Grenwich VillageLoved walking about here. Friends building, SATC Carrie's house and of course Magnolia bakery-stop for a cupcake or 2, there lovely.Had an amazing time and will definatley be back! xBroadwayWe went to see Mary Poppins and it was out of this world.

It is only about two blocks from the small, but beautiful Bryant Park. The taxi ride from JFK is a flat $45 plus $5 toll and tip. It is a relatively small hotel sharing a narrow street with the Sofitel and another hotels as well as a diner and a few restaurants, including the Triomphe which is the hotel's restaurant and where room service comes from. I cannot comment on the food because I did not eat any of it. However, the Triomphe was rated high by Zagat (average of about 23 or so). The Internet worked intermittently, but no different from anywhere else in the USA. The staff were uncaring and barely helpful. Also, when the doorman opened the door for us I overheard him saying to another staff member, ""You know Jose only made $20 in tips?"" That is just not classy. At night, there was no staff at the desk or no doorman, so security is a bit of a concern. There was a video camera installed in the elevator, but I think people can use the staircase from the first floor. The guy who was there at night was not very friendly or even really tried to be helpful. The concierge was only seen a few times during the day.The deluxe room was very nice with an old New York feel to it. However, it was a bit cramped New York-style, too. When you go use the toilet and leave the door open, for example, you have to pee sideways because the door blocks your way. Also, the shower/bathtub is an older type in which you need to pull all the way to get proper water pressure and then push a metal stick to have the water come out of the showerhead. The bathroom amenities were alright though. Our rooms faced the courtyard which had a noisy airconditioning system or some kind of machine that hummed loudly all day. The lobby is like a mix between a classic New York pub and someone's living room (there is a den with computer).The price of the hotel jumped up to double when we tried to add extra nights. So I think we got a very good deal. The manager was helpful and negotiated a lower rate for us which was nice of her. SUMMARY: This is a four star hotel in quality of the rooms, but I think the service could be much better. It was really lacking when we were there and so I want to give this hotel three and a half stars overall. I would stay somewhere else before choosing the Iroquois Hotel again.","Seoul, South Korea","Westinhan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong>",64,3.0

Though staff at the front desk acknowledged the mistake, they were unable to put us in a non-smoking room that was the size we had reserved (four months earlier). So, we spent our first night at the hotel in a very small non-smoking room, then had to repack in order to be moved for the balance of our stay to the type of room we had reserved. The move did go smoothly; we left our bags in our first room and when we returned later in the day, they had been transferred to the ""right"" room.That said, we have visited New York on numerous occasions, never finding--until now--a reasonably-priced (by NYC standards) hotel where we cared to stay a second time. We will stay at the Iroquois again. It has been nicely rehabilitated, the rooms are attractive and comfortable (though some are quite small), the staff was friendly, and the location couldn't be better for visitors. The theater district is just a block or two to the west, Fifth Avenue shopping is a block east, and Grand Central Station is just a bit farther east. And, the legendary Algonquin Hotel--with its lobby bar and resident cat--is two doors away.Besides initially being put in a smoking room, the only problems we noticed were that there rarely was a concierge on duty (though staff at the front desk could provide assistance) and the promised nightly turn-down service didn't actually occur nightly--and when it did occur, it was strangely early (5:30 p.m.). Housekeeping staff also left tip envelopes in the room, a practice we've not previously seen.All in all, though, we were very happy at the Iroquois.","Little Rock, Arkansas","Historybuff52</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Little Rock, Arkansas</strong>",43,4.0

The staff at the hotel were all excellent, from the front desk to the concierge to the bell man to the door man, all very polite and helpful (which is NOT the norm for New York!!). The room itself was nice and spacious, good sized flat screen TV, very comfortable king sized bed, good sized bathroom, all very clean. The view not so great but was still quite light. Two things made me realise this hotel was brilliant. The first was when room service delivered a free bottle of wine to our room as it was my girlfriend's birthday (which I had mentioned on check in). The second was one night when my other half and I came back and we'd stopped at a little place to get a cup of tea to take back. When we got back there was no tea bag in the cup, just hot water and milk!! So I went down to reception and the lady there was all too apologetic even though it wasn't from the hotel! She then went and got us a couple of tea bags for no charge, bless her!Overall this was a very, very pleasant stay. The location is fantastic, literally 1 and a half blocks from Times Square and half a block from 5th Avenue. We didn't have any food there (it was a tad pricey) but it all looked pretty good.

Each evening your bed is turned down, and chocolates and a weather report left on your pillow. If I could change one thing, I'd have windows that can open--but that would allow noise, so it might not suit some--the double glazing meant it was very quiet. There was also one waitress who disappointed with her cool attitude.However, the rest of the staff were terrific--and that's what really makes the place. Absolutely everyone else--from cleaners, doormen and most of all the desk staff-- were ready and willing to help, and generously sorted out any problem. For example, we were offered umbrellas on rainy days, and were allowed to shower and warm up after a drenching on the last day of our stay, long after we should have checked out of the room--and for a very reasonable extra fee.

Looking back, I am quite amazed that not one hotel that I visited prior to the Iroquois was able to match each of my preferences (in some cases, not even half of them!). Given the sprawling, crowded environment of many of the larger NYC hotels that I previously endured, I have become especially fond of the Iroquois' cozy, intimate setting that allows the staff the opportunity to assist on a more personal basis with their guests.

The rooms were a little small but from what I understand they are large by New York standards. The beds were ultra plush with European linens. The hotel offers a complimentary turn-down service each evening...plus chocolates! During our stay, my daughter became extremely ill and had to be taken to the hospital by ambulance. The staff at the Iroquois was extremely caring and helpful. We felt safe and well cared for the entire time we were at the Iroquois.

The room was very clean and attractive, and the shower was incredibly powerful—I could have stayed in there all day!! The beds were very comfortable with nice linens, the bathroom was nicely appointed with luxurious towels and toiletries, and our room was quiet. The location is outstanding—very close to Times Square, the Theater District, etc.The only issue we had was when we went to check out, the woman at the desk said that we had two charges from the minibar (water and a Coke) and one charge for a toll-free call from the room. I said that we did not consume anything from the minibar and that the call was one that she offered to place for me for tech support for the WIfi in the room when she called up to our room to see if it was working again (we had reported the problem that arose at the end of our stay, and one of the staff came up to see about it--since it was still unresolved, the front desk offered to place a call to the toll-free number for the ISP, and I accepted the offer). At checkout, I told the staff member that I never would have used the hotel phone for this if I thought I would have to pay for the call (furthermore, why should a guest pay for a call to tech support when the hotel’s internet service is down?), and she nicely said, ""OK,"" and deleted both charges though I wasn't convinced that she felt OK about this--it did not leave me with a very good feeling. Only after checking out did we realize that the hotel had intended to charge us for beverages that we had purchased elsewhere and left on the table with the minibar items. Those that we bought were different sizes than those provided in the room, and the water was a different brand entirely. It seems that they should inventory their own offerings to see if any had been consumed rather than seeing partially empty bottles and deducing that the guests should be charged. These two minor details ended an otherwise wonderful stay on a less than perfect note, but otherwise, we loved the hotel and had no other complaints. We suggest that you keep your food/drinks purchased elsewhere in another place in the room (or ask the hotel staff to remove the minibar offerings entirely) to avoid the appearance of having consumed some of these highly priced items!","Kennesaw, Georgia","Anonymousatlanta09</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kennesaw, Georgia</strong>",21,5.0

It is only a few minutes from Rockerfeller Centre, Radio City and St. Patrick's Cathedral. We were able to stroll along Fifth Avenue right up to Central Park (by the way would highly recommend the Boat House restaurant in the Park).

I could pay for a service but I decided to brave the cold, windy night & walk to nearby DB Bistro Moderne to have a decent meal.

The Iroquois is quite pretty and in an excellent location. The staff was pleasant. Yet, for me, it’s all about the details and no one seems to be setting best practices or minding that existing protocols are followed.Upon arrival, which unfortunately coincided with the beginning of Superbowl XLIII, I dragged my roller bag up the four steep steps as no doorman was in sight. Naturally, he turned up as I finished my check-in and offered to help me take my bag upstairs in the elevator. I pointed out the irony and he declared that he was the only one on duty that night.The bedroom looked comfortable, although short on power outlets; but my first observation of the bathroom revealed both hair and stains on the sink – yuck. Attempted to call down to the front desk to request the wifi code and the handset of the cordless phone didn’t work. In the morning, I experienced a clogged tub drain as water pooled to about 3 inches while I showered and I then found that the light on the make-up mirror (a nice touch) was burned out. I reported all but the soiled sink (which I wiped down myself). The phone and tub were fixed by the next day, but not the make-up mirror. On the second morning, a random extra box of hand soap was left atop the minibar, where it remained despite at least a couple more housekeeping visits. Curiously too, housekeeping seemed compelled to turn one set of blinds up and one set down when closing them at the end of each day. And the decorative bolster pillow, which during the day rested atop the bed pillows, was placed on the floor during turndown – again, yuck.One last note, which is meant only to be factual and not critical: If you need to be able to personally control your HVAC, this is not the place for you. The system is set to heat during the cold months and despite setting the thermostat to 68 degrees, the room temp nonetheless hovered at around 73, a little to warm to be under a down comforter on even most winter nights.

We were moved to the 4th floor the following morning with minimal fuss, which solved the temperature problem but unfortunately, not the noise. Everthing else about the hotel was perfect, including the location (on a relatively quiet street but just a short walk from Times Square) and the staff were really nice, but unfortunately everthing was overshadowed by the noise.

If you are going to Broadway shows this is the perfect place to be because it's very close by but not in the Times Square hustle bustle.The hotel itself has a pleasant, clubby feel and is much more traditional in decor than most of the other similar type NYC hotels I've seen. The lobby is fairly small and there's a separate room off it called the library where there's some seating and a computer guests may use free of charge. There is also an adjacent bar and restaurant. We did not eat in the restaurant but did have drinks in the bar a couple of times and it was fine.We got a very good rate($180) through one of the booking sites so we were fairly happy with the place. If I'd been paying $300 or more per night we might have been a little disappointed. Our room was on the back side of the building and was very quiet. We were not far from one of the elevators but I was never bothered by noise. Our room was pretty tiny which is certainly not unusual in NYC. It did have a ""real"" closet which was a plus. The room consisted of a small desk and chair, a bed, a mini-bar and a small chest of drawers. The bed was comfortable and the bed linens were very nice. The bathroom was small but not uncomfortable. The toiletries were Moulton and Brown which are good. We were there for 4 nights but I had very little contact with the staff so I can't really give an opinion on service. There was usually a doorman there to open one of the doors and one of them helped us with our luggage and getting a cab upon departure. The front desk people were fine at check-in and check-out.Would I stay there again?

So based on that price I would give it 3 stars. If I had paid more I would have been unhappy. The hotel is in a good location. It is safe. The rooms are small but it's New York City.The negatives- The rooms are insanely dark! Which makes getting ready for two people quite a challenge b/c you are restricted to the bathroom mirror. So the other person cannot be in the bathroom at the same time. The concierge seems to be bothered when asked questions and usually wrong with the best way to get to places and incorrect subway stops. They are very slow with responding to requests. We waited 40 minutes for a roll of toilet paper. The bed is positioned about 18 inches from the hallway wall and it runs along the wall so you feel is if you are sleeping in the hallway when people are walking/talking thru the hall. It is really annoying. Don't take the hummer that is parked outside of the hotel (he is not affiliated with the hotel) he is 3x the rate of a taxi. Plus if you did take him once he will hound you the rest of the trip and he seriousily is parked outside the hotel all day and all night trying to get money (which he has to make a living but it is very irritating)The hotel is in a great location and it is clean and comfortable for under $200 or even $300 I would maybe be ok with it.

The staff was very nice except a guy at the front desk I believe his name was Antonio he seemed very condescending and fake (this is the way I could describe his manner) not the kind of service I'd expect from this kind of hotel. Also they do not offer 24hr room service as advertised I called down for food and they told me it would take 45 minutes I asked why so long and they told me they had to order it from a diner and it gets delivered to the front desk. When I finally received my food it wasn't it warm never mind hot and it was horrible food not what I would expect from a ""4 star"" hotel but they still charged me like it was even though I could have just as well ordered it myself and saved money.

We stayed here for a few days over Christmas and were very pleased with our experience. We'd definitely stay here again if the chance came up and they were offering reduced rates.Good points:Fantastic location - hotel seemed right in the middle of key points of interest without being on a busy street. Close to restaurants, diners (we had breakfast at the Red Flame every morning), shops, and tourist attractions.Friendly staff - no attitude or pretentiousness, very friendly and helpful doormen and front desk workers.Clean and comfortable - the room and bathroom were spotless, sheets and towels clean and fluffy, no dust, no hair, a place I could walk barefoot in.Quiet - even though we were on the back part of the hotel, we occasionally heard honking and the sound of trucks being unloaded, but that was to be expected. We were pleasantly surprised and relieved that we never once heard a neighbour above or next to us. The front doors weren't soundproof, but at least the ceilings and walls were (or maybe we didn't even have any neighbours!)Technology - The TV, iPod docking station and DVD players were top-notch, and the wake-up call system was automated and reliable.Not so good points (nit-picky):Temperature/ Responsiveness - We had a heating issue the first night and it took a few phone calls and face-to-face reminders for somebody to actually come up and take a look. Once it was resolved though, we forgot it ever happened.Lack of washroom storage - As a woman, I need space in the washroom to lay my things out. While they had a few small glass shelves in the washroom, there was hardly enough room to lay out my hair straightener and make-up in the same place. It felt a bit like a juggling act.Running toilet - The toilet ran loudly for like 20 seconds after it was flushed. No midnight trips to the washroom if you have a light sleeper.Cold bathroom floor - Without a fluffy bath mat in the washroom, the marble floors were absolutely freezing. Not a big deal, but I had to either put on my socks, hop around or slide around on the floor towel every time I needed to go in.Overall we had a great time, and the Iroquois provided a wonderful place for us to come back each night to relax and rest up our tired legs and feet.","Whitehorse, Canada","teedTraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whitehorse, Canada</strong>",98,4.0

Service from concierge/front desk was efficient but not the most effusive with more information. Given this is a Small Luxury Hotel, I would have expected more. Fortunately I did not have to use their 1 computer laptop to access internet as it was often used and had a line. The room and bathroom was much tinier than I expected. Possibly this is standard NY sizing but given this price, I expected a bit more. They possibly try to make up with it with Frette sheets and nice toiletries. Think it works for women but not sure the men would appreciate it.

When we arrived we were greeted by a reception area that was in the middle of being refurbished (the hotel conveniently managed to omit this during any booking conversation). First impressions count and needless to say this did not help one bit. The check-in was smooth and the staff friendly and our next experience was the antique elevators, very slow, very dated and very tired. Then the room, whilst it was tidy and clean the decor was also tired but the overwhelming lasting impression is the size, or lack of as the case may be. The bed dominates the room with just enough space to walk around and there was certainly not enough cupboard space to accomodate my wife and my self never mind store any bags/cases out of the way. Now I do not claim to be an experienced New York visitor and I was aware that hotel rooms in midtown Manhattan are small but was not prepared for just how small. We had a room on the front of the hotel overlooking 44th streat which was a bonus as I think that if we had been given a room at the back facing a brick wall or AC unit I would have turned around and walked out. The bathroom was reasonably well appointed with everything that you would expect. The room was furnished with most of the conveniences that you would expect from a deluxe/superior room; safe, iron/board, mini-bar, wifi internet access, wide screen TV etc but did not have any tea/coffee making facilities!? The room was serviced well with no complaints on that front . The hotel has a bar/restaurant called Triomphe attached and whilst the bar was small and friendly the food wasn't great by NY standards.Overall the biggest positive that this hotel has is the location. It's situated on West 44th between 5th and 6th Avenues and is a stones throw from some of the main NY attractions. However the hotel advertises itself as a boutique hotel with the obvious French theme and states 4 star rating and an entry on the Small Luxury Hotels of the world. At one point in time this may have been the case but unfortunately not now. The decor was old and tired and the boutique theme lost somewhere in translation. It tries hard with Molten Brown products in the bathroom and decent towels and linen but doesn't really come up to scratch I'm afraid. Certainly not for the prices they are charging.I don't have any major complaints about the hotel but there is definately better value for money even on the same street as the hotel is located directly next to the Sofitel and straight across the road from the Royalton which both looked more spacious and better appointed.Whilst we enjoyed our time in NY it's unlikely that we'll stay here in future.","Ellon, United Kingdom","Northernpar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ellon, United Kingdom</strong>",14,3.0

The staff were very friendly and the hotel boosted a real customer focus feel.The room was excellent. There was a large flat screen tv, Molten Brown products in the bathroom, chocolates on the pillow and the bed was very comfy.The room and bathroom was very clean with an excellent shower. The only thing I would say was that the they were both a wee bit small but this was overlooked at the level of service we recieved. Complimentary newspapers followed each morning.The location was superb, 5-10 mins walking distance from Times Square and the Subway. It would have been nice to have more than 1 PC in the library as there were times we needed to check things and the PC was being used but the concierge did a fantastic job of filling in the gaps.Room service was always prompt, however be careful when asking for laundary to be done as they stapled into our tops twice. On the whole, we will certainly be going back to stay at this hotel next time we are in NY as it was an extremely comfortable and pleasant experience. However, when you book a cab from the hotel, always go with the Yellow Cabs because the unmarked taxis charge 40% more at times and some of them are not licensed and insured to carry people.

The hotel was really nice and in the ideal location, very central for Broadway, Times Square, 5th Avenue shopping, Central Park, Bryant Park a great place to people watch, Grand Central Station and the Public Library on 5th, which are two, must see buildings. There is a wonderful patisserie called “Le Pain Quotidien” on 40th street across from Bryant Park for sandwiches, cakes, coffee etc. Also worth a visit are Woodbury Common shopping outlet for lots of bargains, get the bus from the Grey Line bus station. Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island is another great day out; The Top of the Rock observation deck at the Rockefeller Centre has better views than the Empire State, get there for sunset.Restaurants we would recommend are Michael Jordan’s in Grand Central Station good food and the cheesecake is huge. Ben and Jack’s Steakhouse on 219 E 44th St. Trattoria Trecolori Italian restaurant at 254 W 47th St, good food at affordable prices.We found the best way to get from Newark airport to Manhattan was by taxi, the cost was approx $60 and it was far quicker than the shuttle bus which we had used previously.","Dundee, Scotland","BJ-Scotland28</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dundee, Scotland</strong>",17,4.0

We would definitely stay at the Iroquois again. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Check-in and check-out was hassle-free. Our room was a Deluxe room which was suitable for our needs. The room was not large by any means. Before we arrived, we had requested a crib for the room. The crib wasn't in our room yet, but we told the gentleman helping us with our luggage that we requested a crib and he told us he would let them know. It wasn't long before the crib arrived. The crib was actually a play-pen but the cute thing about it was that there was a mini Iroquois robe on a wooden hanger hanging on the crib especially for our son. My husband and I wanted a few hours out just the two of us and so before leaving our home, he emailed the hotel and requested the service of a babysitter. The hotel uses the Babysitter's Guild and the hotel arranges the booking for you. When we arrived at the hotel, the confirmed the babysitting arrangements with us via a memo. The dates and times were correct and the babysitter showed up 15 minutes prior to the start time. I was initially apprehensive about leaving my son but the Babysitter's Guild has a good reputation and the hotel has been using them for many years. It is pricey at $25.00 per hour but it is worth it for peace of mind.We didn't get to eat at Triomphe but based on other reviews, I will make sure we eat there when we go back. The Red Flame, a couple of doors down, was always packed. My husband picked up take-out breakfast from there one day and it was very good and reasonably priced. The hotel is in a great location... shopping to the left, Times Square to the Right. We walked everywhere... to the Empire State Building, Times Square, Central Park, Grand Central Terminal, the United Nations, Fifth Avenue.Some people may consider the hotel pricey for its size but I take into account its location.

The subway, theaters, restaurants, shopping... everything is nearby. The hotel lobby is small, but efficient. The ""New York Library"" is a great little room that houses books, a computer and printer (we used for printing our boarding passes), and daily newspapers. The concierge is also right there, and staffed with knowledgable people. Always friendly front desk staff made us feel at home, and the doormen were always welcoming and helpful. Iced tea at the front desk, candy in dishes and morning coffee gave it a warm atmosphere. This place is not stuffy. The room is a decent size by New York standards, and all of the furniture and amenities are top drawer. Loved the Frette linens and robes. We were greeted with a bottle of wine, chocolates, and sparkling water, and on day two we returned home to fresh fruit and a perfectly clean room. This place has it down. New York is a noisy city, and this hotel is no exception. We were on the 12th and top floor, but honking cabs and garbage trucks were clearly heard through the closed windows in the early morning. Oh well, that's New York. Go to the country if you want quiet. We ate at the hotel restaurant, Triomphe, and found it to be intimate and have excellent food. We loved the small plates, and the service was very good. Breakfast at the nearby coffee shop, The Red Flame, was terrific, and unbelievably cheap. Another great food tip is the Greek wagon at around 50th +/- and 6th. Let your nose find it for you. This is amazing and fresh Greek food that will feed two people for $5.

The Iroquois is in a great location in downtown NYC, very close to the theater district and hundreds of shops and restaurants. Upon arriving, we were asked if we needed help with our bags, which we declined. It wasn't clear whether our room was ready when we asked (even though it was an hour after check-in time) but nonetheless, within a few minutes, we were on our way up the elevator. The room that my girlfriend and I shared was costly compared to its size (almost $600 for a suite that barely fits a king sized bed, a small desk, and a dresser). However, the hotel itself as well as the room was very clean and classy. The bed linens were also particularly nice, and comfortable. The plasma HDTV was nice, especially for watching game 3 of the Red Sox vs Rockies world series. However, none of the HD channels worked, and neither did the HBO. For the price we paid, I was going to take advantage of the free overnight shoe-shining they offered. You put your shoes in a bag outside your door by 12 AM, and by 6 AM your shoes are back and shiny. Apparently there was a malfunction since my shoes were never shined.We asked about the HD channels and the shoe shining when we checked out, but we were answered with what basically amounted to an ""oops."" The HD had stopped working, and the hotel was unable to get technicians in on the weekend to fix it. In other words, they were too cheap to pay the weekend rate, since in NYC I find it hard to believe that someone wasn't available to perform this service. Most of our time was spent outside of the hotel anyway, and TV is not generally one of my concerns. We were happy to have our parking ticked validated for the garage across the street. But, the hotel's claimed discount was wrong, and we ended up paying more than we thought for parking.

It was their friendly telephone manner that determined our selection of the hotel. As well, we were truly grateful for the bottle of wine and chocolates they gave us in celebration of our 25 year anniversary. We also believe that the amazing room we had was because of the staff wanting us to have a memorable occasion. The sleeping room and bathroom were luxurious. However, the shorten queen size bed felt a bit odd as your feet and legs hang over the end. There is no readily available ice or ice bucket. As well, if you touch anything in the bar fridge, the item's price is automatically added to your bill. So if you are thinking of having a chilled glass of wine, you need to involve housekeeping or make sure that you tell the front desk to deduct any ""moved"" items from your bill. If you are wanting a cup of coffee in the morning to warm you feet that may have been exposed to the night air, you will need to call room service or go down to the front lobby since there are no coffee makers in the rooms.Having no readily available ice or coffee is not a big deal. And as for a shorten bed the amazing pillows and sheets make up for any discomfort. What reduces our rating of this hotel is the lousy housekeeping. Dirty glasses were not removed and cleaning was minimal. As for complaining about this lack of service, we should have talked to the front desk since contacted housekeeping staff made no apology for their lack of effort. So our recommendation for this hotel is excellent if you get a good rate. We have two other more generic travel complaints. We can't stand bell boys. If we were able to carry our luggage half around the global, why do hotels think it is imperative to pay someone to take our luggage via elevator 100 feet? If we need help, we will ask for it. I would rather just give $5 dollars to a bell boy just to leave us alone. Our next beef is with US airways, who cancelled our flight 2.5 hours before departure without any compensation or assistance in finding alternative arrangements.

The reason for my 4 star rating instead of 5 star is that for the price, I was hoping for something a little bit extra, like more spacious rooms or inclusive breakfast.

I'm glad I did. The desk clerk was polite and friendly. I was upgraded to a ""deluxe"" room. This hotel must have been recently renovated because everything looked fresh and immaculately clean. The room was small, but larger than where I usually stay -- The Chemist's Club/Club Quarters a block away. The bed was very comfortable, turned down at night with Belgian chocolates on the pillows, with soothing music on the radio. The bathroom was spotless and featured Moulton Brown toiletries. Even the way they folded the soft, plush bath and hand towels and wash cloths was artistic. There was a one-liter bottle of Poland Spring sparkling water in the room, and unlike many hotels that charge you $5, at the Iroquois, it was with their compliments.What kept me from giving a fifth star? As a previous reviewer noted, I couldn't get the sound to work on the LG flat screen TV's digital channels. The volume on the analog channels was fine. There was a CD player in the room. In the morning, there was a copy of the New York Times placed in a nice cloth bag (not an oversized plastic baggie or thrown on the floor) hanging on the doorknob. There was also no bill slid under the door, which I actually liked. Whenever I see that in the morning, it's almost like saying, ""Reminder -- don't forget to pay and try to leave early."" Check-out took less than a minute.I did not eat at Triomphe. As expected, breakfast is expensive. I just grabbed a cup of excellent coffee in the lobby and walked three blocks to Grand Central to catch an early train. That close proximity to the station makes this a conveniently located hotel. Broadway is a block away for those who want to catch a show. The Iroquois is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels chain and deservedly so.

It only consisted of a bed, tv (although it was a nice flat screen, half the time the channels wouldn't change/hear them), and a bathroom. The beds were pretty comfy though. The desk/concierge wasn't too friendly. Every time we asked for help/info it always seemed like a hassel. I never felt comfortable. We got an ajoining room with an outer door. That way we could keep our doors open and close the outer door. Well... the outer door locks and there is no way to open it! We realized it and asked the maid to please ask the desk to open the door. We returned about 4 hours later to find a locked door. So we went down to ask the desk and they said they would send the engineer up to open it. Why don't they just have a key??? GOSH. Well we waited... and then waited some more for the engineer. It took about an hour until we could finnaly get into our room. Anways. Overall this hotel was a nightmare.

My daughter loved the free dvd library and the internet access from the itsy-bitsy ""library"" on the ground floor. The hotel's restaurant, Le Triomphe, was also excellent. The location - midway between Grand Central Station and Times Square - could not have been better.

He asked us how we were enjoying the hotel, whether the concierge had been helpful, whether we'd tried the restaurant and how we liked it, etc. ; it turned out he was the manager of the property. He seemed genuinely interested in our feedback, which was all positive, and particularly proud of the fact that many of the staff had been with the hotel for a number of years.

On the good side, the suites are very nice and spacious. The free DVD's to borrow are a nice touch. The location is great. The subway at Bryant Park is the closest and it's nice to walk through the park during the day. Know, however, we took cabs towards the end of our trip and thankfully the hotel is between two of the most famous hotels on the west side: the Algonquin and the Sofitel. Not one cabbie ever heard of The Iroquois, but when I mentioned either the Algonquin or the Sofitel, they knew exactly where to go.Due to a very shoddy concierge staff however, we won't be staying here again. Thinking it would save us time & trouble, two weeks before our trip I booked the house limo to take us to The Iroquois from our home and back. We were quoted a price, worked out the times and were even given the color of the limo and the driver's name. Two days before, I called to confirm the pick-up time and was told there was a problem with our booking. I was told that the other concierge girl had us quoted us the price for a town car & not a limo. They said the limo would be almost double the price each direction!!! They told us they could call out a different company for the price we were quoted, but that ""we might get a foreigner who speaks no English"" and they couldn't account for the way they'd drive!! They said they would ""absolutely not send their top-of-the-line limo out for that price"" and the only thing they would do was send the other company and ""it wasn't going to be a very nice limo either."" I was shocked! They wouldn't budge. I called my regular limo company and luckily, after explaining the situation to them, they took us both ways for even less than The Iroquois quoted originally. I cancelled the limo service with The Iroquois and thought the matter was done. I was sorely mistaken.When we got to The Iroquois in our privately booked limo, there was a letter waiting for us at the front desk confirming that we were using the house limo to go home. This was the very same limo we had cancelled with concierge two days prior. The concierge representative that was there happened to be the same girl I actually cancelled with and she apologized for this SECOND error and said she’d correct it. We got the ""corrected"" letter later that day, but unfortunately, concierge must not have read it themselves, since it was simply a copy of the one we received earlier. We contacted the front desk this time who said they’d take care of it. We didn’t see the concierge hardly at all the rest of our trip.When we checked out, our account was still wrong and concierge was again not at their post. We therefore had to speak with the manager and the front desk again before we could check out since our bill was all wrong due to this now beyond pathetic concierge error.The hotel itself was very nice. However, if you need to book anything through the concierge, I would not recommend this hotel. The Iroquois’ concierge does not honor its word and they don’t value their customers at all. The last thing you want to do is spend your vacation in the lobby and on the phone trying to fix the staff’s mess.","Bay Shore, NY","missmusic</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bay Shore, NY</strong>",251,2.0

What started as a disaster ended up being a pleasant weekend in NYC, largely due to the quality and service at this hotel.Knowing that I was going to pay $300+ for any decent room in midtown I wanted to try something new and perhaps better than the usual W, Hyatt, Waldorf and other hotels in the 300-400 range. Based on reviews here on Trip Advisor I decided to take a chance...I was not dissapointed. The reviews are quite accurate.Excellent for adults looking for a quiet yet conveniently located hotel. The rooms (I had two similar ones) are spacious by NYC standards with a chair+ottoman, full size dresser and smallish desk with chair. Well-laid out. Bathroom amenities (Molton Brown, my favorite) and fixtures (compact Ritz Carlton style) were superb. Plasma TV, windows that actually open, frette linens, comfortable bed (almost Ritz-like), mini-bar, etc. Only thing missing is a coffee maker; I hope someone from the Iroquois is reading this.Staff was quite accommodating to all of us stranded travelers. They kept the same rate through the weekend despite typically higher charges. They had the uncommon ability to know when to help and when to leave you alone. I especially like the hot cider at the front desk in the evening...it took the bite out of the ice storm. Loved the library off the lobby, perfect antidote for small NYC rooms.I spent the weekend watching the St. Patty's parade (started in front of the hotel) and shopping.

My husband and I had been upgraded to an executive king for our stay and I have to say that our room, on the back of the hotel, was exceptionally quiet and comfortable. I was alittle worried when I was learned that the classic doubles, which I booked for a girlfriend and me, weren't located in the rear of the hotel and therefore might be noisier. I really had no cause to worry.

Since its low season, we did not find this as bothersome, but I can imagine it would be if the hotel was full. You can hear conversations right through the door loud and clear; as they can hear yours. For this reason, I could not give it the highest rating, but I would stay here again.

We were attracted to the idea of staying in a smaller boutique hotel with character instead of some giant, boxy Marriott-like monster hotel. We certainly got what we were looking for and didn't have to sacrifice a great location to get it. It's within 2 blocks of Times Square but oddly we never heard a peep at night. We had been warned that you can't find a quiet hotel near the square -but we never experienced any noise issues. The staff was friendly and very attentive. We arrived at noon and our room wasn't quite ready but they were very helpful and apologetic. They offered to store our luggage which was fine because we were ready to get out and explore anyway. When we returned, we found a lovely bottle of wine and delicious chocolates compliments of the staff. The room was clean and bright and well-furnished. My favorite part however, were the bed linens! Unbelievable! Better than my own! The whitest, softest comforter and softest sheets - like sleeping on a cloud. And I think we had 6 pillows to choose from. The only negative about the room was a disappointing view of the fire escapes, but we got over it quickly. The other side of the hotel might have had a better view but probably more noise. The bathroom has floor to ceiling marble - very beautiful and VERY clean. Plenty of towels, GREAT water pressure in the shower, and wonderful, plush robes for your use. Seriously, I really felt like I was staying at a friend's house and not a hotel. It was great to have a warm, quiet, comfortable oasis and the end of a high energy day. We visited the bar a few times during our stay. The service was friendly and the house wines were excellent. I loved the decor - check out the pictures for yourself. Loved the little library in the front of the hotel with access to the internet. Is was great to be able to check email as we came and went. I would definately stay here again.

Check-in went fine. However, when we arrived at our room, we noticed the shower window was see through. It was missing a film covering which prevents seeing into the shower. They moved us to another room on a lower floor (4th). Noise was a major problem throughout our stay. The a/c did not keep the room cold. When we would call down, they would send someone up that would tell us the room felt cold to them. They told us they turned the a/c down from outside the room. It did not seem to make much of a difference. Each room does not have it's own a/c unit. It is from a central unit and you are not able to really control the a/c by the thermostat inside the room.The room itself was okay, small but nice. However, the bathroom was dirty. The shower was moldy and you could tell it had not been properly cleaned in quite some time. When the front desk rang our room to see how things were, I was unable to hear them as there was a problem with the phone. The phone did not work properly until the last day of our stay. At this point, we opted to clean the shower ourselves instead of complaining. The DVD player in the room quit working 1/2 way through a movie we were watching. Granted it might have been the DVD we borrowed from the front desk, but they did not even offer to check the player. We checked out the Sofitel next door after we were settled at the Iroquois.

We unpacked then set out for our first walk around Manhattan. When we came back to the room, they had replaced one of their regular fine bathrobes with a small size one for my daughter. That is the kind of special attention we got during our entire stay. Their concierge was knowledgeable and seemed very objective. She listened to our interests and didn't appear to be pushing any particular places or tours (unlike some I've found in other hotels). The rooms are typical NYC size -- but very nice.

The view was not brilliant as the room was situated at the side of the hotel and overlooked the rear of another hotel. However, the quality of our room and cleanliness more than made up for the view.

They have no real customer service department and the one they do have is virtually impossible to contact so we will never book anything with Travelocity again (BEWARE). We will go back to this hotel but book another way.The only other word of warning I would give is that the restaurant which you can use for breakfast up the road was not value for money to me and my partner felt the fried breakfast was deep fried and overcooked. We ate the rest of our breakfast's eleswhere, the Apple Cafe in the Empire State Building excellent value for money.

Our experience was overall disappointing, mainly because of the laconic and almost passive aggressive attitude of the front desk staff. Throughout our stay we encountered various problems; when we attempted to rectify them the hotel staff was dismissive and invariably made us feel each problem was somehow our fault.1. When we checked in very early in the morning we were laconically pointed towards the elevator, with no offer being made to assist us with our luggage.2. The second night we did not receive the turn-down service (and the eagerly anticipated Godiva chocolates). When I commented on this to the front desk the next morning I was informed that I must have left on the ""Do Not Disturb Sign"". This was not the case. In fact, I couldn't figure out where or how to turn on that sign, even if I had wanted to.3. Sometime during the afternoon of our second day the internet wireless went down and I was unable to conduct some business. When I brought this up with the front desk I was told that the internet was up and there was no problem at all. (Translation--I was somehow doing something wrong). It turned out that the internet was indeed down for the rest of the evening and was not up and running until the next morning.4. The servicing of our room was consistently late (past 2 in the afternoon). One afternoon we returned to the room past 3 p.m. and it had still not been cleaned. Of course, I informed, once again, the front desk. Needless to say, they were not pleased with me. I noticed that with each of my ""complaints"" they became less and less cordial.5. Our last afternoon at the Iroquois we requested that the hotel book a taxi for our departure early the next morning. My husband was informed that the bellman would get back to us shortly with the details--we are still waiting . . .! We eventually booked private transportation to the airport.There were positive things about the Iroquois. It has an excellent location--two blocks from Times Square without the 24-7 din one finds there. Great restaurants, museums and shopping opportunities are within walking distance. Also, if you don't feel you burn enough calories exploring Manhattan, the hotel has a respectable, if small, exercise room on the premises. Finally, the complimentary wireless, high speed internet is a great amenity.To summarize, the Iroquois has the fundamental elements that comprise a great hotel; however, their staff needs a few lessons in customer service.","Marana, Arizona","Wyldman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marana, Arizona</strong>",7,2.0

Her first trip to NYC and I wanted it to be special, since it would be a memory of a lifetime for her. First task: Pick a hotel.First, we saw the Iroquois featured on a TV travel show and I made a note of it. Second, I used the TripAdvisor Reviews extensively to check out independent reports of the several hotels I was considering. One criteria was for a small, luxury type hotel ( 4-star minimum) that would not overwhelm my daughter but provide comfort, class, service, relative safety and great location. In this regard the Iroqouis met my expectations.I expected smaller rooms per the reviews I read and was not surprised. Even with a double bed room, the room was ""small"" by some standards. Same goes for the bath; but it was marble and spotlessly clean with very high quality towels and robes.The beds were fantastic. The bed linens and comforter were first quality. We slept well.A note about room location: Many first timers to NYC want rooms overlooking the city. From experience I knew that an ""inside"" room is generally preferrable for noise considerations. I also booked the room from the hotel's website and took advantage of an off-rate program for the time of year I was visiting. So, room location was what I expected. We got room 1108. Yes, another Review writer (who had room 1107 )commented on a noisy ""compressor"" (actually a fan) audible from the room. I heard it also, but my take on such things is different: As long as something like that is not overwhelming and is classified as ""white noise"" I find it can be a benefit for sleeping.The TV is a top notch flat screen plasma unit. High definition channels come alive. BUT, there were some stations listed on the channel card that were not available. And that list was somewhat limited to begin with. This actually was not a big deal, because we were not hanging around the room anyway and late night arrivals meant we promptly went to bed.The closet space was very limited but ingeniuosly fitted into the room. A room safe was provided.We noted the snack and drink bar unit but I instructed my daughter not to touch it due to the high prices that normally accompany them.The free bottle of Perrier was nice.Staff was great and helpful. Even the desk clerk hailed a cab for me when the bell staff was otherwise engaged. Concierge very nice and helpful.We only ate one breakfast in the hotel. It was good and not that high priced by NYC hotel standards. I wish we could have tried the Triomphe Restaurant for lunch or dinner but time did not permit. My impression from their menue is that they try to keep the meal prices within a somewhat affordable range at least as hotels go. (For budget friendly eats, go a few steps west in the same block to the Red Flame.)The best thing about the Iroquois,aside from the great way they treated my little girl, is LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!

Co-workers, fed up with the snobby Sofitel, had been staying at the Iroquois and gave it rave reviews. I am typically a Marriott points junky, so I have been staying at the Courtyard on 41st for business, but am frankly fed up with the crowds, waits for elevators, no restaurant/bar, and weak service that Marriott provides. For this trip in early January, no convenient Marriotts were available, so I decided to look into the Iroquois. I did my research on the web. They had a very user friendly site, and I reserved a suite or two rooms that adjoined since we were traveling with a 7 year old and a 9 year old. I immediately got an email response confirming our reservation with all the detail required. We walked from Penn Station/Madison Square Garden (since we took the train into the city from Trenton) and got to see a little of Times Square on our way to the hotel. We arrived very early in the morning so I did not expect our rooms to be ready, and they weren't. A very professional and apologetic staff member told us exactly when to come back and introduced us to the concierge and the bellman to store our bags. The concierge was extremely helpful and provided maps and directions. I had done a lot of planning in advance so had already made some reservation. We took the concierge's advice on 5th Avenue, the SONY museum (free) and a carriage ride through central park. We also took her advice the next day on the Museum of Natural History and the Hayden Planetarium which were both great. They had fresh coffee in the morning in the lobby. The rooms were very nice. The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and everything was clean. There is a mini bar (careful, has motion detectors, need to watch small kids)and the hotel leaves a small box of chocolates and small bottle of red wine to welcome you - a nice touch. The rooms were nice sized for NY and the bathrooms looked like they were recently redone and had marble tile. For two nice rooms at less than $500 total for both rooms per night, it was definitely worth it. The best part was that it was a small hotel, so no waiting hours for an elevator, the staff was very friendly, and you could walk anywhere - Broadway, Times Square, 5th Avenue, Central Park - yet it was quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel to friends who are looking for a nice boutique hotel. I heard the bar is great (we didn't go we were with kids) and we did not get a chance to try the restaurant either - maybe next time.","New Hope, PA","Sherpa25473</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Hope, PA</strong>",10,5.0

First of all, the street is great, with clubs, restaurants and other neat hotels. Secondly, the convenience to the theatre district, Grand Central, Fifth avenue shopping and general mid town. Secondly, the rooms are absolutely beautiful, very Ralph Lauren look, with English traditional furnishings and very comfortable.

Everything was perfect. The rooms are small but perfect for one person traveling alone on business. (Reminder: 99% of hotels in NYC have very small rooms.) My flight arrived at 8:30 AM so I was at the hotel shortly by 9:30 AM and just wanted to check my bag with them but they had a room ready for me so I was able to freshen up before my meetings. I had a room on the 6th floor (600) that faced a little courtyard which was quite nice as the hotel is not tall. About 10 minutes after arriving, they called the room to make sure that everything was satisfactory. The bed was amazing, like sleeping on a giant pillow. Wonderul linens and down pillows with big duvet. The bathroom was great with Molten Brown toiletries and a showerhead with unbelieveable water pressure. I was concerned about the handle on the shower because it felt like it was loose so I told them at the front desk when I left to go to dinner around 7 PM, when I returned 3 hours later it had been fixed. The room had a COMPLIMENTARY liter bottle of SmartWater on the desk when I arrived! Nobody offers free anything anymore. The hotel also had complimentary overnight shoeshine service which was quite nice. The Iroqois offers a nice [big] continetal breakfast in your room for $11.95, a steal in NYC. I was on business and paid $260 per night, including tax. That is a steal for 4-stars in midtown during the week. I booked directly from their website, not through a broker.

Our guests literally ranged from 3 to 95 years old, and the hotel was a great fit for all. The staff were totally accomodating about everything we needed and the many extra touches only enhanced our experience. From the junior Frette robes for my little nieces to the complimentary bottles of wine for the more mature guests, they provided all the necessities for a memorable family weekend. And the comfortableness of the beds at the Iroquois will now be a recurring topic of conversation among my family! And the dinner far exceeded our expectations! The food is outstanding, and truly stands out in a city known for great restaurants. All the guests were surprised by just how good the meal was. My family (a food loving one!) will be talking about the apple caramel bread pudding for some time... but only after it's done talking about the scallops appetizer with foie gras and porcini mushrooms. And I'd confidently put the filet mignon up against any I've ever had. Each bite was a distinct enjoyment.  My family comes to NY quite a bit, and I know they'll always first consider the Iroquois when looking for a hotel. Most importantly, my grandfather loved it all. He stayed there Saturday as well (even though he lives on the Upper Eastside). As a lifelong New Yorker who has experienced it all in this city (including storied business lunches at the Algonquin), Pop had never heard of the Iroquois or Triomphe. But since then, he's been raving about both and smiles widely when talking about the weekend. He keeps saying, ""We have to go back to Triomphe for dinner!"" For the convenience offered, the comfort of the rooms, the attentive staff, the amazing food, the luxurious but homey decor, the excellent value... you will not find a better hotel in NY City.","Brooklyn, NY","Expedition986</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, NY</strong>",8,5.0

Apparently we triggered the electronic sign somehow, but it was never noticeable to us when leaving or entering the room. So for the final 2 1/2 days of our stay the room was never made up. We ignored it the first day and figured that we must have been in the room when they came to make it up. The second day we didn't get back to the room until late, after the shows, and found that all towels were still wet and nothing was cleaned. We called the front desk, where they told us that our Do Not Disturb sign was on. I looked and looked and couldn't figure out where it was.

We had an east facing room with a wonderful view of the Chrysler Buildling at night.We just returned (November 2004) and the second visit was a totally different experience.

They did move us the next morning and the rest of our stay was more-or-less fine -- a pipe broke and there was no hot water early Friday evening, and one of the two small elevators also stopped working and this created long waits trying to get out or back to our room in the company of other irritated patrons.The Iroquois (like the Algonquin) is an old building with limited capability to provide the amenities of more modern hotels.I don't know if we will go back or spend the extra $100 a night for a large room with working facilities.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Johnji</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",25,3.0

Yes, the non-suite guestrooms are cozy by out-of-towner standards [averaging 250-275 square feet], but this is Manhattan. You can pay much more for even less space, comfort, and service elsewhere, e.g., the W hotels. Indeed, one can often book a suite at the Iroquois -- with a not-at-all-cramped living room doored off from the graciously-sized bedroom & a bath which includes both a soaking tub and separate, walk-in shower -- for less than a standard room at many better known hotels. Plus, all the rooms at the Iroquois have marble baths [combined tub/shower in non-suite rooms] and are well sound-proofed; I have never heard noise from the rooms around me or the hallways. If you are a very light sleeper, however, you don't want a room which faces onto 44th Street.The Iroquois was first suggested to me several years by the folks at Express Reservations (a great booking service by the way) as being especially appropriate for a businesswoman traveling alone. They were right; I've always felt secure & well cared for there, even at the bar where a solo woman will feel quite comfortable & enjoy having an after-theatre nightcap.

The room we had was not large but lovely. Only complaint would be that the air conditioning did not work well in our room.

We took advantage of cheaper rooms to support the tourist industry after the dreadful sept. 11th. We wouldn't normally have been able to afford this hotel and as budget travellers Im sure we looked a little out of place showing up with Back-packs instead of Prada suitcases !!!!! However we were treated wonderfully......the staff recognizing us after just a few hours, opening door and generally helping us find great places to visit and cool restaurants. The rooms were beautiful and not really too small by New York standards. Gorgeous down comforters, white robes and a bathroom to die for. If I hadn't been so keen to see more of New York I could have stayed in that bed forever !! Being thanksgiving there was a beautiful Xmas tree up in the lobby and constant hot cider available for free.Thanks you Iroquois.If we ever win the lottery we will be back on a regular basis.","Dallas, Texas","Britgirl_dallas_72</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",41,5.0

Although the rooms are a bit small, they are cleverly arranged so that I never felt cramped. The beds are clean, comfortable, and full of fluffy pillows. The staff is friendly, and knew me by name after my first night. The restaurant is top-notch, too.

The Old-World Elegance of this classy hotel was just what we wanted for our romantic getaway! The beds were comfortable, and the rooms were amazingly upscale for the price we paid. We got to visit Broadway and Fifth Avenue, and when we returned to our suite's living room, we felt like we were in a fine Paris hotel...we will very likely return again for an encore of our own ""Autumn in New York.""",,Extraordinary29951,13,4.0
