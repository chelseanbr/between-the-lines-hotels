This is a great hotel with a few caveats. We booked a King Bed with Waikiki View + Club Access (paid for via points + World of Hyatt Club Upgrade award- during our stay it would have been about $260/night including their $42/night resort fee and taxesfor just the room I think it was closer to $350/night to include the club upgrade)We were contacted a few days prior to our arrival by the VIP manager Stacey Martin to confirm our arrival details and if there was anything we needed (not sure if this was because I am an World of Hyatt Explorist or because of the Club access addition). Stacey warmly greeted us at check in which was a breeze and we got lovely flower leis (the true tourist Hawaiian experience!) and there was sweet pineapple tea at check-in! We arrived a bit prior to our check-in time and were able to be accommodated into our room early. We were assigned room 2860. The room was lovely with a nice view of Waikiki. The hotel surprised us with a cute heart shaped orchids on our bed and towel birds and a gift box of chocolate as this trip was for our babymoon! Very sweet!Unfortunately, the room we were in had a bad seal on the balcony doors and there was very extreme wooshing sounds leaking into the room at night that disturbed my sleep - if we pushed the door closed (but not locked because it would leave a gap) the sound would stop but eventually the seal would loosen again). We contacted Stacey about early the next morning and it Jason the manager from Housekeeping came by to try to remedy the problem (very nice guy!). Unfortunately, their quick fix was not quite enough for me. Stacey very expertly moved us to a different room on a lower floor (room 960 -two queens but a very nice ocean front view) hoping it would have less of a wind noise problem. We didn't have any more issues for the rest of our lovely stay! I would definitely come back to this hotel but only if I could guarantee a lower floor (I booked my room with points so we had less of a room selection, but we don't have a problem paying the regular pricing for what you get at this hotel). We had to call the front desk for information and when you call front desk the first option to to request a room change....which is telling that it is a known issue... Usually, when my husband and I travel we look for places to take our extended family in the future as we often invite along/pay and arrange for both sets of our parents and sometimes siblings and spouses so this place is definitely in consideration for a block of rooms in the future. The Hyatt Regency Waikiki is so close to the beach (across the street!-literally a 4 lane street in front of the hotel), and close to both regular and high end shopping and a plethora of restaurants! Their resort fee (which we didn't pay as we paid with points this time) is currently $42/night but it includes water bottles, tote bags, discount on car rentals, discount on surf classes, credit toward bike rentals, classes (yoga, cooking, cocktail, etc), beach towels and beach chairs you can bring with you to the beach or anywhere!!! Well worth it for the ease and convenience it gives you. The Club lounge is nice for a light breakfast, evening snacks and very affordable beer and wine (noon to 3 or so is slim pickings as its only non-alcoholic drinks, cookies, and snack bars). The pigeons and other birds outside are somewhat aggressive if you are on the patio but the patio seating is quite nice.Additionally, there is a Hertz Car Rental in the building with very affordable rates (with corporate discount at least) so renting car for a day was very easy!My husband and I would definitely stay here again as the location, service, amenities and rooms are great!",,jambroffkao,9,5.0

If you are considering a stay at this hotel, I urge you to seriously reconsider.We last stayed here in 2012 and everything in my review (https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60982-d242435-r147757917-Hyatt_Regency_Waikiki_Beach_Resort_Spa-Honolulu_Oahu_Hawaii.html) still applies. We have stayed in several other Waikiki hotels since 2012 and we thought we’d give this place another chance since Hyatt claims it has been “refreshed.” That was an unfortunate mistake. This hotel was built in the early 1980’s and has only had largely ineffective updates since then. The walls of the rooms are sloppily painted (over wallpaper) and the door frames and baseboards are chipped and dirty. The interior and exterior doors and windows are obviously original and provide little in the way of soundproofing. Other guests in the hallway sound like they are in the room with you, and noise from the street enters the room unabated through the patio doors. The rooms are just as sparse and tired as they were in 2012. In our room there was sofa chair that looked OK but when we sat on it, we realized it’s just a thin foam cushion on a plywood platform. It’s quite uncomfortable.The tiny bathroom with the shower in an old, stained bathtub screams “motel” not refined hotel. This place really is a dump. With room rates at $300 and up and a daily resort fee of $45 (plus tax) it’s a total rip off.We were told on two separate occasions by members of the hotel staff that it was acquired recently and is losing money because “the new owners overpaid.” I wouldn’t expect a drastic renovation in the near future.Now, let me tell you about the overall Waikiki environment. Since our last visit in January 2019 Honolulu has decided that street performers can use amplification equipment all day and evening (up to 10 pm, but in our experience it’s closer to 11 pm when it stops). Now, you might not see this as much of an issue until you find out these amplifiers are more suitable for stadium performances than street performances. They are VERY loud. In our 20th floor room they drowned out conversation on the lanai, and inside the room they were loud enough to to require turning the TV volume way up to hear it. This went on all day (starting by 10 am) and into the evening (past 10 pm).We used my iPhone sound meter (tested against professional sound meters as very accurate) and found the noise at street level at 87dB, which is 7dB beyond the threshold for danger to hearing.There are only a few street performers generating this noise. It is incredible that such a small group of people could generate so much intrusive noise disturbing thousands of tourists staying in hotels nearby, including this one.I find it strange that the hotel association here would not approach the city and ask for action on this. We were told by the hotel there is a bylaw applicable to Waikiki that specifically allows amplifiers for street performers, apparently without regard to how loud they are. It’s as if the city is deliberately spiting the tourists on which it largely depends for its economy.Within the hotel, there is a fountain in the atrium between the two towers that generates 77dB of noise. The front desk staff agreed it is very loud and they don’t like it either. It makes communicating with the guests difficult, but for some reason the powers that be must think it creates a Hawai’I ambiance. News flash: it doesn’t, it’s just very loud white noise. The whole atmosphere in the hotel common areas is unpleasant and seems to urge you to leave as soon as possible.","Victoria, BC","VictoriaTravellers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, BC</strong>",83,1.0

The room, hotel it self, restaurants(also staffs), regency club& staffs, valet, bell man were just exceptionally helpful, kind. But NOT the front desk staffs.It seemed AlWAYS under staffed, and not as professional compare to mainland’s Hyatt properties and when I asked the front desk staff, the staff also said they’re slow because they’re understaffed! WhenI checked in(11am but informed the room is not ready, which I requested several times through email and texts, but understandable) waited so long even in the Hyatt priority line. I had to come back around 3pm to recheck in and waited so long. And every staffs looked exhausted, no welcoming or nor even a word to their Hyatt members. Since I stayed a straight 7nights, my key was not working for the Elevator and room several times I had to go back to the front desk and had to wait a long line always. They’re always busy morning to night, not enough staffs!!!It seems like they care more about Japanese credit card holder members (JCB?) since they had a seperated desk and the host was always big welcomed their guests. Parking was another hassles. It is definitely the worst self parking building ever. It’s a separated building so you’d have walk outside to cross a road in order to return to a hotel. And inside of the parking building was Super narrow you’ll have to be careful to get bumped to the wall or with other car. When I checked out I told the staff the parking was insane and the lady told us it’s because it’s only one ocean front parking(what??), yeah the front desk staffs were hilarious.But I have to say other than front desk staffs and long waits, everything else was perfect. Specially I’d like to thank to Regency club staffs(evening shifts)who tried to talked to me in Korean(he said he is trying to learn for the customers) was so nice and kind and the food quality was exceptional compare to other Hyatt’s regency club. So happy I booked with it my entire stay.I also had a breakfast everyday at Shor and the two men hosts were amazing as well. Only after the first morning the host remembered my last name to assist me better, it’s a big hotel and so many customers and it was so touched!I was having a breakfasts every single day for a week and the two men were always there, worked very hard always smiling!

Let me start off by saying that my family always will stay at a Hyatt if possible because we have always had a great experience. That wasn’t the case the week of December 19! We had a trip planned to Waikiki for Christmas week for my family (12 adults and children). It was the worst vacation ever! The first room we walked into was absolutely disgusting, the walls were dirty, all the bathtub porcelain was chipping off. The bathroom door was broken and half spray-painted, there was a big green booger on the inside of the bathroom door. The patio door going outside to the patio was broke and didn’t want to open which caused me to break a nail upon arrival. I called management and they said that they were booked up and I would have to wait a day or two. Several days later they put us in a different room and it was just as disgusting. One of my other rooms they had giving me had this disgusting smell and we needed to be changed out of that room as well. I paid about $30,000 for this trip and the Hyatt Regency Waikiki ruined it! I have stayed in Motel 6 rooms that were nicer than this! The only person in management that was halfway hopeful was a woman from housekeeping. Nobody else cared. They don’t care if you are a loyal Hyatt member, not at this hotel anyways. I’m about to tell you the icing on the cake, after dealing with the nightmare of the rooms, they were offering catered Christmas dinner that a person would order ahead of time and pick up the morning of Christmas. We own a two bedroom condo at the Waikiki Beach Tower next-door so we were having our Christmas luncheon for 12 people next-door at noon. I ordered all of the catered food on Saturday and was assured that it would be ready for pick up Christmas day between 9 AM and 12 noon. The person that took my order gave me the wrong directions to where the food was to be picked up. That’s OK people make mistakes no big deal, let’s ask the next person we see if they can help us. The next person sent us to the opposite end of the property, needless to say there is no catering personnel there either. Long story short, we went through about eight different employees and nobody could tell us The correct location. It was blowing about 60 miles an hour and raining heavy. I was soaking wet because one of the employees of the Hyatt told me that the catering office was off of the property down the street so I went there as well with no luck. I had my hip replaced a couple months ago so this really took it’s toll on me. I finally got a hold of somebody who was willing to actually come help me find this place. Lo and behold, when we finally found somebody that could truly help, they told us they did not have my food reservation so they had nothing for me. I started looking for the food at 9 AM and now it is almost lunchtime. I have 11 hungry people waiting at the condo next-door for a fabulous Christmas dinner that is not coming. I was in tears, this is probably one of the only vacations where grandma would be able to be there and it was a disaster. I ended up having to get McDonald’s to feed everybody. $30,000 trip and we had McDonald’s for dinner, disgusting dirty rooms with green boogers on the doors! I have pictures that will blow your mind! Upon check out they offered me $100 food credit for all of my troubles LOL. Everybody at that hotel is oblivious to what is going on around there. I am still so very upset. One more fact to add, my family went to Waikiki last year and we got a room at the same hotel. Upon checking in my husband went to wash his hands in the bathroom. When he pulled out the white hand towel to dry his hands, a glass crank pipe fell out of the towel and shattered on the floor. We weren’t even in the room five minutes! We immediately called management and security came up with housekeeping and cleaned up the mess. So obviously whoever cleaned that room before us probably never even touched the folded hand towels so the housekeeping never switched them out and washed them, therefore the drug pipe was still hidden in the towel. I was mortified to say the least. Even if it looks like nobody used the bedding, or the towels in the bathroom, they still need to be switched out every time that room is re-rented.

Yes the resort fee is lame and expensive and that would be my only gripe.I normally stay on the hilton hawaiian side so this was my first time on this side of Waikiki. It was this or the outrigger waikiki beach. Ive been very happy with my stays at previous Hyatt Regency properties. Ive read all the recent reviews on the hotel from the construction noise, the dirty rooms, the nonchalant staff, and especially those elevators. I was very apprehensive and told my wife to expect waits. I am happy to say i didnt have to eait more then 2 or 3 minutes and that was rally during the mornings around 730-8AM.We also met the ukelele guy and he was awesome. My kids totally loved listening to him and interacting with him. Now my oldest wants to learn the uke instead of the violin...We booked a ocean view room and we were situated in the diamond head tower however we were facing towards the beach vs diamondhead. The lanai was a generous size and I spent lots of time out there either watching the sunset or eating.Location is super walkable as mentioned i normally stay om the otherside of waikiki so its atleast a 20 minute walk to get to anywhere. Here i can just go down stairs and be in the middle of everything! The trolley is easy to get to as the stop is roght across the street. Me's bbq js a block away and was my goto for breakfast everyday.Yes you can hear some construction noise but it wasn't that bad, hey you are in the middle of a city..close the sliding doors and itll cut out most of it.The only thing that was not enjoyable was on the last night some loud ass domestic abuser checked into the room beside us at 12am and was yelling at his gf or wife. I had to call security twice to tell them to quiet down. So happy that was our last night.The pool guys were great as well, i think it was robert who gave my kids some freezies as well, mahalo brah!It was a shame that someone had an accident in the pool as well...it didnt reopen the rest of the day.Loved the water bottles, kids insisted we bring them home to remind them of our trip.We did not eat at any of the restaurants on site only got coffee downstairs at kai coffee.There is also a farmers market couple of times a week...but meh just browsed and quickly moved on.Bidet is greatbin the washroom and house keepong was prompt.","Vancouver, Canada","johnny f</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",22,5.0

They decorated our room with flowers and gave us free champagne, leis and a chocolate cake. We bumped into their “Director of Rooms” on the second day, I think his name was Don, he said he came from Toronto (we remembered because that’s where we’re from as well). Don was walking all over the hotel observing and asking customers how their experience was at the hotel, that’s the level of seriousness they take with their customers. We mentioned our fridge was not cold enough and our fruits and milk were going bad. By nighttime on the same day when we returned from sightseeing, another fridge was in our room. During our stay they were repairing the elevators which was a bit annoying because with the fewer working elevators, sometimes we had to wait 5-10 mins, we reflected this to Don and the next day we noticed they opened the freight elevators as well so we no longer had to wait. Aside from the great customer service, the hotel was in a great location, right on Waikiki beach, we only had to walk like four minutes to our surfing lesson. Rooms were modern and clean with Japanese electronic toilet. Also to note was I loved their breakfast buffet and the dinner buffet! It was delicious and had a wide variety.

The elevator has a displayed graph of wait times that goes up-to 15-20 mins during most time of day like breakfast, morning, afternoon or evening. The rooms were very spacious, being Explorist we were upgraded to 29th floor and views were great. However, the ambience of room and quality of decor, elevator, lobby and pretty much entire building made it look like 70s and not lively at-all.The regency club is a big joke. They literally had 2 cookies in the name of dessert during evening and cheap quality alcohol as ""paid"" drinks from 7-8:30pm.

However there are 2 things to be aware of:1. We had booked an ocean view room on the basis that we would be getting a view similar to that shown on their website for a ""2 Queen Beds with Ocean View, High Floor"" room which showed mostly a beach/ocean view. However, all of the view from the room was of the tower opposite and it was only when we walked onto the balcony that there was an ocean view on the left. When we asked at reception about this, as we thought that we'd been allocated an incorrect room, they advised that that is in fact an ocean view room. We asked if we could be relocated to a room with a view as shown on their website but were told that there were no rooms available for the duration of our stay. From what we could see, it would seem that the room next to ours and the two next to that would be rooms with views similar to the website picture,but ours was not. If I was booking again, and wanted an ocean view, I would be specifying that I wanted a room with an ocean view the same as that advertised. 2. Construction has started on a building on an adjacent block and construction noise (including rockbreakers) started at about 7.30 to 8am each day. Since the building isn't yet out of the ground, I imagine that that noise is going to continue for some time.

In summary, it was an outstanding experience. Here are some details that you may like to know:Room & Amenities:Thanks to Hyatt Explorist membership, during my first stay I got upgraded to the penthouse on the 39th floor, facing the Waikiki beach. I had three open balconies with a heavenly view from the Diamond Head to the end of the Waikiki beach.During the second stay, I got upgraded to a room on the 38th floor, with an excellent view of Diamond Head.Very nicely appointed rooms with relevant amenities. Rooms were spacious and very well laid out. The bathroom had a shower, full-size bathtub and a toilet. Restaurant & Bar:I did not get a chance to use restaurant and Bar at the hotel. Looking at the long queues, I can imagine these must be good.Shops and Cafes:Hyatt Waikiki has several shops and cafes in the hotel, so it is easy for guests to choose where and how they would like to enjoy their time in Waikiki. Additionally, Guests can avail services from various travel and tourism service providers located within the Hyatt premises. Access:Access to the Hyatt Waikiki from Honolulu Airport smooth with a taxi ride of 30 minutes during non-peak hours. During peak hours it may take an hour. Service & Staff:Staff members were accommodating to serve guests with Hyatt quality. I would particularly like to highlight Kayla and Olivia, who welcomed me during my first stay and made me feel at home. It was good to get a lei around my neck and to experience the Hawaiian hospitality at the Hyatt. I faced no problems during check-in, checkout or requests made from my room.

I always like Hyatt Regencies, but this one is special. First off, my room was large, very well-appointed, and, from the balcony, I had a view of the ocean. The mountain and city view I had from the room was also very attractive. I had asked *only* for a truly quiet room, because I have been unwell and really needed my sleep. And sure enough, with the patio door closed the room was nearly silent! I slept extremely well there. I paid a very fair Hyatt member rate and I feel like I got a great value.The room had everything a hotel should offer, and then some: the bed, a king, was appropriately firm, level, and even expensive-feeling. In my youth I sold furniture and beds and l am very particular, so you can take that to the bank - the beds are NICE. Well-padded, but not soft and squishy like all the ""pillow-top"" beds they foist on you nowadays. There are bidet-style washing jets in the toilet, lots of towel bars (a must!), great water pressure, and a really nice shower with a hand-held sprayer, an adjustable-height shower, and a high overhead rainfall shower, too. PLUS a tub with a regular faucet if you want to take a bath, instead.What really made my stay great was the kindness and friendliness of the staff. It began with Kouji, the bell-man who got me settled in. He saw I was traveling alone and he kindly sent me a gift basket with coffee and jam and chips and some amazing Hawaiian cookies and macadamia chocolates. I was touched by his thinking to do that for me. He must be a favorite around there, he seems like a real people person.My trip was to help a family member no-one has seen in 40 years, my youngest brother. It was challenging. Basically, other than family-related chores, I was all alone at the hotel for 8 days and nights. I missed my husband and my cats, terribly. So the people working at the Regency Club made a big difference in how I felt every day. Takumi and Cary and James and all the beautiful young ladies there always had a smile for me, and sometimes tried to tempt me to eat more treats, another serving of pasta or salad before the buffet closed, or maybe have a little glass of Crown Royal. Takumi even recommended me to his own Realtor, who was able to help me find some rental houses. I am applying online today to rent a cottage near Chinatown for my brother. Without Takumi's Realtor, I would have had to work with a stranger. I'm sure I would not have gotten the personalized service someone with a local reference enjoys.Moving on, the fish tacos at the pool are wonderful, and Barbara my waitress was quite a character. Seeing the interest the pigeons had in my lunch the first day I ate pool-side, she gave me a squirt bottle and told me to just aim at them, but don't pull the trigger, and they will fly off! Sure enough, Barbara had them well-trained. They waddled away from the bottle and my commands to, ""go on, buddies""! They seem to learn who is on to them, because they didn't really try after that day! No bottle needed. The view from the pool is lovely, and I am ashamed to say I was spoiled by the service and comfort and never went the extra 100 feet to the beach. The Waikiki famous beach ...I got an email from the director of rooms, Donald Kim, asking about my stay. He seemed interested in my questions and observations. It feels like there must be good leadership at the hotel, since how else could they keep as many very long-term employees as I met there? I could go on, but just want to say that my trip was made bearable by the hotel's wonderful features and amenities, and, most especially, by their employees. They are fine representatives of Hyatt hotels, the kind of people who make a traveler feel loyal to their brand.

We stayed a week in a room on the 36th floor. First, after a 10 hour flight, was told my room was of Waikki 'mountains??!! Paid for (thru Delta vacations) for what i thought would be a beach view. Don't believe it was the fault of Hyatt but will pursue that matter through Delta Vacations. I had a preconcieved mental vision of what a Hyatt property should be and wasn't disappointed with the main lobby atmosphere etc. The problem began with the reduced elevator service (due to one out for assumed maintenance) and the general apperance of the room. This room showed wall (paper) scares and worn carpet. When much time is spent in ones room, it should reflect the amazing Hawaiian experience without issue.

I was under the impression the Hyatt would be right on the beach and would provide us with a relaxing stay. The hotel was a bit different than what we expected. They are working on the elevators so during peak times it can take a few minutes to get an elevator. The hotel is across from the beach. Not right on it. There were towels and chairs available by the pool which was nice. The restaurants in the hotel were basically just the pool bar and the buffet. We upgraded to have access to the regency club which was great for breakfast and to avoid the long lines at the buffet. Granted it was $50 a day but we figured it evened out if we were to pay for 2 people for breakfast. Our ocean view room was fine, but for $529 a night I was disappointed with the size of the bathroom. Luckily, it was just 2 people because I’m not sure we could’ve made a room of that size work with more than that. There was no mini bar in the room but they did give us reusable bottles to fill with water. Lots of places to walk to and the concierge was very helpful. Overall: I was not thrilled with this Hyatt Regency. Maybe my expectations were too high because my last Hyatt stay was the park Hyatt in Tokyo. The location is great but the room lacked elements. The saving grace is the customer service. All the employees went above and beyond to help answer any questions we had. If we were a family with young kids I think my review would be different. But as we are older and wanted more of a resort feel, this location didn’t meet those standards. We still had a wonderful time and would recommend! ",,kathleeng144,3,4.0

The lifts are terrible it will take forever for a lift and after a big day of tours or shopping, you're in no mood to wait in a queue for 5-15 minutes for a lift to your room, not to mention that if you need to get to a tour, make sure you leave your room 15 minutes at least before you planned to, because there's no guarantee of getting a lift in time to make your transport. The laundry onsite is terrible, there are 5 washing machines and 5 dryers FOR THE ENTIRE HOTEL and people often leave their clothes in there and don't/forget to take them out and the hotel is unable to do anything about it. Lastly, but most importantly, what stuck out to me and my travelling party was that if you're not Japanese or Chinese, you're money doesn't count for anywhere near as much as theirs. You will get rooms on a lower level, they also have their own private bar/entertainment area which they can only get into. Once I saw this, I made a point of eating/spending money anywhere else but the hotel. My travelling party and I will never stay at this hotel again.At the end of the day, there are many other hotels in the Waikiki area which will be much more suited for you and your family than this place if you're not Japanese or Chinese, please find them because this is not the place for you.","Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","BigKostdog</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</strong>",9,1.0

We had a transfer from the cruise ship to the Hotel and this is where my disapointment in choosing this hotel as part of our cruise vacation package started.We were dropped off on a side street where a passenger had to help unload luggage it was chaotic and unorganized. The driver was not sure where we were to go, a person from the hotel showed us where to put our bags and informed me not to leave anything of value on the loading dock. And said just walk around the building with very little direction. The signage was aweful and took a while for the group of us to find the front desk. We were told to come back for 130 as they would put a rush on the room, we came back at 2 and told that rooms are not ready until 3, we came back at 320 and still the room was not ready but they phoned and cancelled what they called a second check of the room and let us in. The hotel was under construction which we did not know would be occurring. The elevators were slow to the point that they posted signage to show peak times.The rooms were large which was nice, the bathroom was worn with the tub paint job very obvious. It looked like they did an upgrade of the room trying to modernize but not done with dedication to details. (Ie bottom of doors all chipped, two tone badly painted tub). The signage throughout was not very clear or visable.The location is right in the middle of things so that is a positive if you want quick access to the beach and shopping. For the price I was very disappointed and I should have explored the hotel better. I know all of the area is expensive $350+ a night hotels, $60 hotel buffet etc. ",,ShannonPB,9,2.0

Although the renovation scaffolding is a bit of an eyesore, it didn’t impact our stay. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. Lovely big room. We stayed in the diamond tower on the 5th floor, room 558 (we think) which was classed as a city view but we had a great view of the beach (and the flat rooftops of the lower floors). A great spot for watching the sun rise from our bed. From our balcony we also saw our cruise ship arrive on the Saturday morning which was a surprise and got us super excited for the next leg of our trip. On the Saturday morning there was a parade which we could clearly see from our balcony. Suggest you check exactly what view you’ll get before booking as the rooms are all at different angles and if you want to see the beach, I wouldn’t go lower than floor 5 because the palm trees will obscure your view. We had breakfast included, which saved us a small fortune but there are plenty of places to eat around the ‘strip’. The breakfast buffet catered for all with a healthy choice of foods and fresh juices. Good coffee too. Bed was huge, bath tub and shower were of high quality and the complimentary tote bag and water bottles were a nice touch. We would stay here again.

Staying on the floors 30-40 will give you exquisite views every day. The location is central for walking around the main spots of Waikiki. While the beach is across the street, it is easy to grab towels and chairs from the pool area and bring them to the beach with you. The hotel also has many shops and casual eateries within the first floor mall. There are several ABC stores within the buildings as well, allowing easy access for all of your room and beach needs.We stayed in the Family Suite for the first part of the trip and got upgraded to the Penthouse Suite for the last half of the trip. There are at least 2 more suite styles above the size/quality of the Penthouse Suite. The family suite combines two rooms, one a king suite with full bathtub/shower combo, private lanai, and a living area, the second is a wheelchair accessible studio with a Murphy bed, full bathroom with shower, private lanai, and a seating area. This worked well for us during the week as my partner and I were on different sleeping schedules and he would move to the studio to do work while I was sleeping. It also allowed us to have separate bathroom spaces. The Penthouse Suite is significantly larger, has a separate king bedroom, a full bathroom with shower (I was disappointed in the lack of a bathtub), a walk-in closet, 3 private lanais, one with chaise lounge chairs, a full sized kitchen with a nice refrigerator, a massive living room with lots of couches and chairs, a separate desk space with an Apple computer and printer, and a half bathroom.While the rooms were spacious and appear to have been somewhat recently renovated, there were some downsides. I did not find the quality of the linens, towels, beds, and furniture to be as luxurious or comfortable as other Hyatt Regencys I have stayed at. Part of this may be due to the beach atmosphere and using fabrics that are less likely to stain or be impacted by water and sand. I also found the rooms to be a bit dingy looking as sometimes the paint job was off (mismatched colors), you could see painted over wallpaper seams that were starting to pull apart, and some of the furniture and linens were mildly stained. The set up in the Penthouse suite was a bit frustrating as given the amount of space they had, I'm not sure they used it wisely.
