This place is bad! Room is dirty and rundown with ants in bathroom. Smells weird. They use actual keys for their rooms! I guess the key got caught on with my car keys when I took it out of my pocket. $150 charge. $35 for parking. The parking is over on the next street under some apartment. Nightmare. Booked it for 3 nights but I'm leaving as soon as I can! ,,BeatLA808,0,1.0

Room up a flight of stairs, no lift. Arrived 22.30, just managed to catch a member of staff as they were leaving. No overnight reception. No parking, only 3 metered spaces out on the road limited to 2 hours for $3/hour or free overnight (IF you can get a spot) between 10pm & 6am. Nearest and cheapest overnight parking approx 400 metres away at $20 for 10 - 12 hours.Room was dark and smelled musty. Very basic. Very tired looking. Plenty of cupboards but in disrepair. Ironing board but no iron. No hairdryer. Fridge was useful. Microwave which we never used so unsure if it works. Air con efficient but was extremely noisy. No windows, just dark shutters facing the pool so very noisy especially at night, could hear all the traffic, party goers, people around the pool, bin lorries etc, not conducive to good nights sleep!! Outside the door we overlooked the back of the property which looked like a rubbish tip...old mattresses, skips etc. The bathroom toilet seat was loose, mould around the sink, shower was hot and powerful which was good. There was no room service unless you pay extra, so our towels were never changed and bin never emptied the whole 5 days, although, having a skip at the back meant we just tossed the trash over the balcony and it landed in the skip! The bed was comfortable.There is a 7 eleven over the road which is good, it’s where we got our morning coffee and pastry. They sell microwaveable food as well as fruit and a selection of Asian food.Staff were polite.Would we stay there again? Definitely NO!",,jet5158,2,2.0

The place is a dump. The room we got had black mold all over the bathroom. You could see it under new paint so obviously it has been an issue for a while. I shortened my stay there and got a refund. I went to ""the stay Waikiki"" down the road. A much better place.",,B7960YQpaulm,0,1.0

We got 6 days in the Dirty , Smelly, Black Mold. The bathroom smells like Urine. The shower so bad. When I complained was told it was a 10$ fee for house cleaning WT....? I think jail would have been cleaner. The only bright side is location. I would only recommend to my worst enemy.

I tried to cancel and it said i had to cancel by 11/24.. what?? So I drove there to check it out and theres no obvious PARK HERE sign, then learned parking is $45 per day. I understand its waikiki but FFS even the Sheraton doesnt charge that much.I said fk it and booked at the ala moana location.

I found on airbnb which I didn't think was a hotel, no one seemed to write a bad review. The hotel is dated, unkept, paint peeling off the door frames and ceiling, security latch busted on door, left over shampoo on shower wall, chipped cabinets, our ice bucket was given to us as a garbage bag. security light blared in window all night, exterior wall was only screen except top two feet, could hear everyone outside, location great bed comfy but the rest didn't impress. luckily only stayed one night.","St. Helena, California","Jean M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Helena, California</strong>",4,1.0

You don’t really need a rental car at this location. The pool is nice, and there is a shaved ice spot located conveniently right outside the hotel lobby. The room was no-frills, includes a TV and WiFi access, and ours had a shower stall only (no tub). It is a quaint facility, I’m guessing from the 60’s, which I actually appreciated the character of it. There are a lot of windows with screens, and wooden blinds that you can open or close. It’s essentially an open air room, and there is a window a/c unit provided, which was more than sufficient. Temps in Waikiki range from 65-85 so this was a nice touch. Since it is structured as an open air room, there were a few ants around. They weren’t bothersome. Seriously, we didn’t spend a ton of time in the room anyway, with all there is to see and do in Waikiki. For the time we spent there, it was comfortable (beds are nice). I would highly recommend this as a budget friendly alternative, with rooms roughly averaging $100 per night, you can’t beat the price or the awesome location!!",,Gayle C,1,5.0

We booked with our airline and didn't really know the hotel by name. It just was in a great location near the beach and the main strip of waikiki beach. When we checked in we were told that they would be no maid service our fresh towels every day with out paying a additional fee of 12.00 aday. This after paying a additiomal resort fee of 34.00 for 3 night stay. When we finally was able to see our room to our shock we entered a room that was in such disrepair it should be condemed. the furniture was broken down. Walls were horrible dirty, electric lines exposed, ants crawling every where, floor was not carpeted and unclean, TV didnt work [everyday we had to ask them to fix it], the door didn't fit frame you could see the outdoors when the door was shut, bathroom was falling apart and very dirty looking, the ceiling was water damaged and falling down in spaces, kitchenette was dirty and ants crawling on the counters, the airconditioner was so dusty it made for horrible breathing issues. It took several pictures of this horrible adventure and plan to advise the airline customer complaint line. With all that said I can tell you the bed was clean and no bed bug on a happier note. My advice stay clear of this hotel.","Tukwila, Washington","sondral92</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tukwila, Washington</strong>",0,1.0

Studio we were sent to was so hot we could sleep in the room. AC did nothing to cool the room which was in excess of 96 degrees. AC Unit was rusted away on outside and the ground was covered in mould. Says its been open a year, what they don't tell you is it was student accommodation before that. Outside of walls were black, swimming pool had tiles broken and missing around the edge of the pool. No TV in room No Wifi (advertises that there is free Wifi and TV in rooms) in rooms you have to go to the covered couches to get any. Washing machines were rusted and old. Over all a disgusting place to stay. I was bitten on the foot in the bed and it blistered and ulcerated. Still not healed after two weeks.",,K5823FBkathyb,3,1.0
