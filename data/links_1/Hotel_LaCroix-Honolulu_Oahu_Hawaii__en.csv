We were greeted immediately upon arrival, served fresh juice and given a traditional Hawaiian welcome with lei's. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Room was very nice and clean. Normally I get congested from all of the chemicals used in cleaning, however that did not happen in this hotel. Got a great nights sleep and felt very rested. Continental breakfast was awesome! Lots of fruit, juice, eggs, pastries, coffee and tea. Relaxing pool area. Within walking distance of Waikiki and lots of shops adn restaurants.

Every time I visit this hotel gets better. First off - the staff. Every one of them are friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Liz on reception who helped me with a room change and also advice on getting to Waikele Outlets. And also a special thanks to Erica in reservations. The rooms are also very good - if you're after a 5 star hotel, this isn't it. But the rooms have everything you need - comfortable bed, great views, balconies, mini refrigerator, well maintained bathrooms and very clean room. I had breakfast there each morning - had everything I needed to start the day. And again, all the staff at breakfast were great. The location is fantastic. Short walk to the beach, shops, restaurants. The free wi-fi works well.

My first visit was with a friend and we had such great customer service I decided to come back with the family, and it was even better! We live on Kauai so we visit Honolulu a lot. Let me just tell you- the sense of ‘Ohana at Hotel Lacroix is unmatched compared to any other hotel I’ve stayed at. First, we had a slight snafu with our original room, and it was taken care of immediately and with flying colors. The sweet security gentleman even gave my kids a (big!!) bag of snacks. The parking gentleman (I forget his name, a tall man) is so nice, he gave us the best service! Make sure to tip this man! Everyone at the front desk was so friendly, helpful, and the best part, so personable. You really do get the sense of family here. They even serve a free hot breakfast buffet, which they call “continental breakfast”, but it includes everything one could want: hot pancakes, scrambled eggs, fresh mixed greens salad, tons of fruit, cereal, hot oatmeal, tons of pastries, bagels and cream cheese, the works. They just don’t serve any breakfast meats but ummm, it’s free so that’s understandable! Even the buffet staff is so friendly. The pool is great, not huge but there’s room for adults, as well as two small pools on the side for younger kids to swim, and it’s a gorgeous setting with palm trees all around, beautiful at sunset especially! And there is a jacuzzi which isn’t very common at Waikiki hotels. Impeccable customer service all around. I highly recommend Hotel Lacroix, especially if you’re looking for a nice relaxing vacation. It’s not a huge resort type setting. Just a cute, clean, comfortable and enjoyable hotel. Mahalo staff!

Selected the hotel in part due to good reviews on Trip Advisor. Unfortunately we were underwhelmed . The staff here is great, friendly and really try hard to make you feel appreciated. The location is great with a short walk to the beach and lots of restaurants in the area. The use of pool/beach towels is a plus. Unfortunately it’s hard to hide that this is an old building. The bathroom was tiny and did not have vent fan. The tub was old with lots of caulking issues. They would be better off taking out the tubs and putting in showers ( more room ). The shower curtain fell down when we hung a towel on it to dry. The breakfast buffet was nothing special. Lots of fruit and pastries but the only protein was microwaved eggs. We went out on our second morning to enjoy a much better breakfast for just a little more money than the hotel wanted to charge. The happy hour is a nice touch but the drinks were cheaply made. We did enjoy having a balcony but it seemed every bus in town stopped on the street below us making it very noisy. Also our upstairs neighbors decided to move their lanai chairs around for an hour in the middle of the night, waking us up. Overall our stay was just ok.

There is no view from anywhere and the pics are deceiving. There was only one tiny trash can in the entire room/bathroom. There was a party going on in the room above us at midnight the first night and we called the front desk but nothing was done. The beds are pretty comfortable and we got some rest thanks to earplugs. I travel a lot and this is a low 3 star or high 2.5 star hotel. Also, after all the fees were added in, I was charged $175/night by Cancelon. I was surprised to find out upon arrival that the hotel was charging me anything $86 for resort fees. Hidden fees are a real pet peeve of mine. I called Cancelon and they said it's in the fine print that this can happen and not their responsibility. For $200/night you could certainly find a better hotel.",,194careng,0,2.0

Cost us about $1800 AUD for 4 nights for our family of 7. While cc’ing wasn’t the cheapest we had buffet breakfast included so thought at the time it was a good deal. Check in was fairly easy but only 1 room was ready so we all piled into one room & dropped of our luggage. The rooms were bright & clean & we were located on the 14th floor. Lanai had a great view of the city & partial view of the beach so that was nice. The young gentleman who checked us in was pleasant but didn’t explain too much about the hotel amenities. There were a few other guest waiting for other requirements so think he just wanted to check us in & move on quickly. There were only 2 people at reservation check in & about 8 guest waiting. There had been some power issue at the hotel so the 3 lifts were not operating very well. One lift was only working & it was terribly slow. They’re were signs around to notify the guest so that helped. The lift would stop on every floor which was somewhat annoying but by the end of our stay all 3 were functioning. I must say the housekeeping staff on Level 14 were fabulous. Jim was awesome & kept our room beautifully spotless. Little touches like my daughters blanket & soft toys were often presented out on the bed with flowers laid out on them. The beds were made immaculately & I would have to say the beds were the best we had in Hawaii & were the Most comfortable to sleep in. AC was cold & quite often we would have to turn it off as the room was cool most of the day without it on. Shower was great & bathroom clean.There was a young lady on reception who’s customers service was outstanding. Young lady with short curly hair maybe of mixed heritage. I forget her name but she was fabulous & I commented to her that I would mention her. She was amazing & I do hope the manager will pass on my feedback. The breakfast however I would probably have to mention was the worst I’ve ever tasted in all my years of travelling. The seating was terrible & overcrowded, food was cold & tasteless & the staff were probably the rudest I’ve ever seen. There was one particular lady who seemed to completely despise her job but thought it would be still polite to show her respect. I’m sure it couldn’t be easiest job & she seemed to be the only one working. Location was towards the south end of Kalākaua Ave. Would I stay here again, maybe 1 or 2 nights but not any longer. Give the breakfast a miss too.

This was supposed to be a 2-night bonus-stay in Waikiki after a long week clearing out our elderly mom's home. When we realized we needed a few extra days of cleaning and packing before relocating to Waikiki, we called the hotel, and the reservation staff graciously moved our check-in date forward and found us a room with no extra charge for the date change. Upon check-in we found ourselves moved to the Penthouse level. Room 1703. At first, we were missing the corner king studio we had booked with a lanai, but there was a low window that opened in our room, and it did the trick to bring in fresh air. Upon waking, the view from the PH level is gorgeous, with the sun rising in the East and the ocean picking up the light on the West. As the sun rises it does get warm quickly in the bedroom, and especially the bathroom where there is a fan but no A/C.We give special thanks for the guest services representative Jody. She was so kind and accommodating at check-in and took great care of us on our last night when we returned to the hotel, completely exhausted.Never saw the breakfast area, the pool, or the work-out room...which were some of the top reasons we booked LaCroix.

But waiting a couple of minutes for the only elevator in operation was frustrating. Then when the doors open, 12 occupants fill it, no room for me and my wife. Next time, you never know if the staff laundry cart will take the place of 5 passengers in a 10 passenger elevator. Couple times we decided to take the stairs, all the way from the 10th floor. Noticed other younger guests sometimes did the same. No indication that there is any urgency to get the other broken elevators fixed. Grrrr! Our room, although on a corner with two lanais, had only one slider that worked because of unrepaired concrete spalling on the edge of the lanai. It looked like more concrete would drop on the passersby below, hence no going out there for you. Ask for the Ocean View rooms, it's more costly but worth it, in my opinion. Beautiful views across the green belt that is Fort DeRussy at the entrance to Waikiki. Despite this busy street and intersection, the room was relatively quiet.

It has a lot of great things about it, but the main con (noise) was a major issue for us.Pros: *price compared to other places * if you book through their site, they waive the amenity fee (the fee is common at many hotels)* you can check out towels, beach chairs, and snorkel equipment for free * rooms are spacious * views are fine (but no need to pay extra for a nice view as any view contains a busy road.* free breakfast and the occasional happy hour * super friendly staff who had helpful suggestions* luggage storage post-check out Cons: * they keep their brochures for activities behind the desk so you can’t just peruse the options on your own. They should either have those out or have a compiled list of suggested activities if they want the payback by booking themselves * no airport transportation* noise. Now, I’m not a stranger to traffic noise - I live behind a highway. On our first night, our room had a busy road on two sides. Busses, trucks, and motorcycles zoomed by constantly. It shook the doors and the rumbling kept us up all night. It lessened at about 2am and started again at about 5am. Needless to say, it was not the relaxing or refreshing Hawaiian sleep we hoped for. Early the next morning, we asked if they had quieter rooms and they were kind enough to move us. The new room only had one busy road and it was quieter, but still quite noisy. I read other reviews about loud air conditioners and I kind of poo-pooed them, but the a/c’s were actually loud. It sounded like a bus idling right by our room. In the lobby, everyone had to talk loudly to hear each other and they played somewhat loud music. It was just a cacophony. In the rooms, some of the noise issue could be helped by replacing the aluminum sliding doors or adding exterior wall insulation if there isn’t some already.So even though the rooms were great and the staff friendly, the noise issue ensures that I wouldn’t stay here again.

My room was tiny and was worn down. There were small stains on the carpet, curtains, and ceiling. Paint was peeling and wood frames were warping and chipped. I saw a few insects crawling in the bathroom on occasion. The mattress was way past it's prime and droopy. The bathtub is kid-sized. No one over 5 feet tall could relax in that. The hotel pool is small as well.I also found the check-in process to be sloppy and overall customer service to be poor. Simple, basic hotel requests were a challenge for the hotel staff to perform.The continental breakfast provided was acceptable. However, after witnessing one of the hotel guests hacking up phlegm and coughing right over the trays of food, I lost my appetite and stuck with drinking coffee.","Vancouver, Canada","Play_It_Sam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",45,2.0

This site and others had off the chart reviews of this hotel so, I booked it. I was NOT impressed at all. The hotel is run down and has little to offer unless you are desperate and on an Extreme budget. Here were the misses:--Room was not clean. Used coffee cups and pillows that looked like someone just slept there.--Hardwood floors that were dirty--Halls of each floor have floral smell of some sort and is not natural--Popcorn ceiling with stains and tiny bathroom--Pool is a total Joke. I've seen bigger blow up pools. I kid you not the pool is a few feet wide in a square shape--TV in room had big stripe going down the middle. Dead pixels.--Mattress is mega thin. Little more than a foam think with thin sheet and no spread.--Breakfast area is barely that. Old walls/lights. Place feels Mega Dated!I'll list a few positives too:--Nice view from the corner room of city--Can get beach towels/chairs for free--""Miles"" was nice and friendly. Not his fault the hotel needs a total refurb.--Didn't see any bugsSo, in conclusion I cannot recommend this hotel. It was nothing like the pictures and there are plenty of other places nearby. If budget is the main concern and you get this on a great deal, then, o.k. if you are just looking for a place to sleep. If your expectations are this hotel is a 3.5 star, you will be very unhappy.

We were afforded a complimentary happy hour in the dining area complete with appetizers beer and wine.

The hotel is in close proximity to restaurants and there is a free shuttle that can get you to the mall, shopping district as well as Waikiki Beach that stops right outside the door.

It has two smaller lounge pools on the side which is great to just chill. Our little one loved it because it was like his own little play area and he could stand on the seat/step inside. The whole pool deck is not complete yet but it looks great so far. The bathroom is clean and has a shower inside.

Nice breakfast that includes made to order omelets, fruit, sausage, rice, weird pancakes, scrambled eggs, coffee, juice. Safe for valuables in room.Not so Good: Not a resort by any stretch of imagination, but they charge a resort fee daily just to use some beach towels. No choice. It just raises price of hotel by $25 per day. Also went up from $25 to $35 for valet parking. They used to give 2 free breakfasts with room but now only give 1. Charge $20 for extra person. Nice, smallish rooms but very skinny bathroom doors, not regular size. Bathrooms small, cramped. No exhaust fan. Towel hooks falling out of drywall from people hanging on, trying to get out of shower I guess. No drawers in room to put clothes. Had to remind maids to give toilet paper, Kleenex, & clean dry towels when serviced rooms. Towels do not have enough air to dry daily for re-use.Bottom line: I would stay here again but add $25-35 per day to initial cost + valet if have car.

We are traveling full time and we stay in hotels all the time. We know whats the standard and we are no picky people!!!Let's start at the beginning. We booked a ""Corner Studio"" because of the beautiful images and the size of the room. At the first evening, we got a complete wrong room without a balcony. The lady at the counter ask us why thats a problem because that would be an even better room we have now with a kitch.... After a little discussion, we got our Corner Studio a day later. So we had to change the room the first time. When we moved into our Corner Studio we immediately recognized that the room gets promoted with the wrong pictures. The balcony that you see on the photos of the ""Corner Studio"" is actually the balcony of the penthouse but they just put it into the room of the ""Corner Studio""... So you are being cheated here!!! Keep your eyes open! The rooms look on the first view clean but in reality, they don't! We had black feed after 5 minutes in this room. When we whipped the floor with a towl it went complete black (see attached photos) (that happened in all 3 rooms we had, yes we had to change the room again!!!). The staff was 90% stressed and you always felt like you do something wrong when you just say hello. Just the guy who helped us with our bags was super nice! The cleaning staff told us every time we saw them that we should make a good rating on TripAdvisor with their name in it. 3 days before we had to leave we had to change our room the second time because of some construction... So we had 3 rooms in total! All in all, it was one of our worst experiences in a hotel this price range.

Don’t let the outside fool you. Like people say “don’t judge a book by its cover” this hotel has gone over major renovation and it really shows.

The room was large, had everything we needed and the king size bed was extremely comfortable. The staff was superb: Aude, NIcki at the front desk, Thomas at the complimentary happy hour, and Katerina who cleaned our room all went above and beyond to make our stay one of the best vacations we have ever taken!! The location is perfect with a bus stop literally outside the door and the beach a short walk across a park area. Our rate included free hot breakfast which we thoroughly enjoyed; the food was delicious with lots of options that varied from day to day.

Price is very reasonable, rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was EXCELLENT: so nice and accommodating for everything we needed. There were some unruly guests on our floor (hey, it's Waikiki, things gets wild and that’s not the hotel’s fault) and security was very responsive to our call. Great kamaaina (half off parking, great room rate, and free breakfast). Location is perfect, far away from noise but close enough to drug store, restaurants, and shopping. We didn't use these but they had a lot of amenities like boogie boards, beach chairs, umbrellas, etc. Pool is modern but small but good for lounging and the restroom was so nice. When they have everything all completed on the pool deck (still a little construction happening while pool was open), it'll be really nice. My one complaint was the breakfast and dining area was fine but not sure if I'd pay for it. Glad it was included in the price. The restaurant is hot and very strangely designed in terms of space and flow. Also not sure if the omelette bar is up to code in terms of how they store and prepare the food. Things looked quite unorganized there e.g. bag of bacon bits in the sink. The food was ok (2.5/3 stars) but nothing extraordinary. The hotel can really increase their revenue with some modern touches to the dining area as well as offering some fresher buffet items and maybe even having an all day restaurant with room service. We did Uber eats a lot since we stayed in due to recovering from medical procedure in Honolulu. Again, grateful to have a convenient and hot breakfast but can definitely be improved. But who stays at a hotel for the breakfast anyway? Lol Bottom line: Don't hesitate to stay here, you won't regret it.",,k2chance,0,4.0

Here are the good bits. - Location is good. Nearby to downtown Waikiki strip and also beach (about 10 minutes walk)- Rooms are clean, tidy, recently updated and refurbished. - Service ok.- Room service good (although one of the days they didn't bother to make up our room - change sheets, tidy room etc) - Good array of breakfast itemsHere are the not so good bits.- Reception don't seem to care much. She asked me for what occasion had I come to Hawaii, I mentioned my 10 year wedding anniversary and the renewing of our vows. This was met with indifference. You would normally expect a congratulations at very least. Some hotels do even upgrade you. - Arrived feeling jet lagged and exhausted after the 9 hour flights from Sydney. Paid for the early check in but upon arrival, receptions advised room wouldn't be available for another 3-4 hours. This was a really disappointing start to my stay. - Paid the additional fee/cost of the water sports - e.g. surfboard, snorkel gear etc - found out it wasn't in the room as I thought, you had to front up to reception and it was first come first served (so there was a limited number of items available) never ended up evening using it. It's absolutely not worth paying extra for- Better security. Lifts could do with security swipe or pass. Anyone can come in off the street and go up to rooms, This didn't leave me feeling particularly safe. - You can hear the rooms nearby and can get noisy! - There were a couple in the room above us arguing and fighting on one of the nights, - Happy hour empty and very few choice of drinks (I think only 2 or 3) Overall ok stay, but some things definitely ruined it.","Brisbane, Australia","Ricemasterflexx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",14,3.0

The ladies and gents were a bit short, I get that we had an upgraded room, wouldn't have needed to stay in the same room type and change rooms, however no solution or none of that was offered.

Very reasonably priced for the surrounding hotels in the area. If you want the proximity of Waikiki but don't want to pay for a Hilton or Sheraton, this is a great choice. On the downside it is right next to Kalakaua Ave, which is quite a busy street, and a couple of times during our 10-day stay I woke up from ambulance sirens. All parking is by valet, pretty normal for the area and there's an additional charge for it.Breakfast: was included with our hotel deal, and I was expecting a modest continental-type set up of a few sugary pastries and tired-looking fruit. I was pleasantly surprised to discover quite the opposite: a buffet of cook-to-order eggs/omelettes, waffles, pancakes, 2-3 daily rotating breakfast meats and potatoes, breads, bagels, muffins, oatmeal, fruit, cold cereal, coffee, juice plus a daily small salad bar. Most mornings included steamed rice and miso soup options as well. The breakfast area was large enough to find a seat no matter what time in the morning you went. (6:30-9:30am)Staff: front desk always polite and professional, housekeeping staff eager to please, our housekeeper gave us her card and hours, which was nice for planning purposes. The maintenance staff really excelled in my opinion, some of the friendliest and most prompt service I've ever encountered in a hotel setting. We needed to call them twice for a couple of room issues, and literally within minutes they were knocking at the door. They were on our floor doing touch up painting most of the time during our stay, and went out of their way to hold elevators for us and give us a smile and hello.Room: If staying in a plush, brand-new room is your thing, then it might be better to continue looking down the street. The room itself (while obviously updated) has signs of being a slightly older hotel.There were popcorn ceilings and the bathroom had a slight mildew smell after a few days. Beds were plenty comfortable though, never had an issue there, and the pillows had varying degrees of fluffiness for your desired preference. Gym: Gym facilities are important to me in a choosing a hotel, and this one was rather small and disappointing-2 treadmills, 2 elipticals, 1 bike and small free weights area with 1 bench and abd machine. However we were so active with activities it wasn't too big of a deal.Overall: good price, great breakfast, great location, comfortable beds. Would 100% stay again",,Wikolia1970,2,5.0

Initially assigned a 4th floor street facing room. Construction was happening in the hallway. Between the street noise and construction, it was too loud to stay. Asked to get a new room. Ended up on the 12th floor. The glass sliders were not dual paned so short of changing hotels there was no way to get away from the street noise. Despite this I give this hotel 5 stars because the staff was accommodating, the rooms were clean, the beds comfortable, the hotel is centrally llocated just off the main drag, and super affordable. The hotel will let you check out boogie boards, towels and chairs for the beach :)). Even though parking is valet only, I found it super convenient to valet - never a long line or wait. We managed to get plenty of rest and thought the stay at La Croix was more comfortable than the Sheraton Waikiki. Our 3 nights stay equaled the cost of 1 night at the Sheraton! Really can’t beat that. Besides the Sheraton felt stuffy and inconvenient, the beds too soft (did a number on my back) and the grounds/beach only so so - way too touristy.

We arrived early, room was not ready but they stored our luggages, so we were able to walk around without having to haul our luggages. Awesome and unexpected complimentary drinks on certain days. Naoki’s a great bartender, front manager, who works hard and really pays attention to hotel guests need! Mhila, our housekeeper, was very nice! She checked on us to make sure we have everything we needed and made sure our toiletries were stocked and fresh towels was replenished daily. An added extra touch in our room was the cookies, bunny towel and flowers on our bed that Mhila left for us daily. We did not use the pool or try breakfast as we would walk to the beach in the morning and grabbed breakfast on the way. They run out of beach towels on our 2nd day & it was only 8:15am.

There’s an adorable hang out area on the first floor where you can get breakfast, work, or play board games. It so cute it looks like it’s from a K-drama.The best part of this place was the location. It was near the heart of Waikiki such as the International Market place and the beach. However, it was far enough from those places that the area near the hotel was quiet and peaceful unlike other places such as Hilton Hawaiian Village. The place also had one of the best views of the ocean since it’s in front of the old Army base so there’s a flat area and your view isn’t blocked by any buildings.Also, if you’re on a high floor with ocean view you can see the Friday Hilton fireworks perfectly!!","La Jolla, California","emmako808916</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Jolla, California</strong>",0,4.0

The good: most of the staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was great with many fresh options. Happy hour was awesome with basically unlimited drinks. You could rent beach towels, boogie boards and more from the front desk. Needs improvement: The rooms were fairly clean and bright, but you can tell some need a little TLC. The tub in our room wouldn't drain and we had some issues with it leaking. The batteries were dead in the fan and TV remote and this took a bit longer than expected to have rectified. The kitchenette in our room was really small/dumpy and not really worth the extra price. Valet parking is not ideal as you don't have access to your vehicle and sometimes have to wait awhile for it to be retrieved (most hotels in Oahu have valet parking as the only option). It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the beach, and I would have preferred to be slightly closer. However, the price of the hotel reflects this. Overall, I'd probably stay again....I just might request a more updated room.","Kingston, Canada","AvidTravs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kingston, Canada</strong>",95,4.0

The room was nice, the only thing I would change was the bathroom had one double hook. With 4 of us in the room, we had no where to hang up our towels, or even a hook for the hand towel. Forget hanging up swim suits. The hotel has valet parking, for a few.

Our entire stay was amazing, the staff were so helpful. You can get beach umbrellas and chairs (as well as boogie boards and surf boards but we didn't get those) for free which was nice. The only bad thing I can say about this hotel was that there were no cushions on the pool chairs and no umbrellas at the pool or on the balcony. I understand there may be an issue having an umbrella on the balcony but when I asked I was told that they were not at the pool because someone had complained previously but I think it was an oversight to remove them it makes it quite uncomfortable to be at the pool in the hottest hours of the day and sit on the pool chairs for any extended period of time. If there was an issue with the cushions perhaps the chairs could be replaced by the ones on the balconys. Overall we throughly enjoyed our stay here and I would recommend to my friends and family.

We would totally recommend this lovely little boutique hotel located at the end of Waikiki. We booked directly through the hotel's website, and our hotel stay included a bull breakfast buffet for 2 every morning and two refreshing cocktails at the hotel bar for 2 every evening. The renovated pool opened just as we arrived and, although small, it was very lovely and refreshing. Our rooms were clean and comfortable, had a fridge (which was important because my husband is diabetic and has to have his insulin kept refrigerated) and a small balcony. The entire hotel staff (including front desk, room service, bartenders, baggage handlers, etc.) were very kind and helpful. It was a much more personal, friendly and intimate environment as opposed to a large boisterous hotel. It was a short 10-minute walk to Waikiki beach and to many shopping and eating establishments. Also, there was a trolley stop directly in front of the hotel and bus stop locations very near, and we saved a lot of money using the trolley and bus to get around the island.","Pearland, Texas","vclark1957</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pearland, Texas</strong>",11,5.0

I was not disappointed.The building itself is showing its age. While the hotel has been given a spruce-up, it's certainly not fancy. But nothing to complain about with the room itself or the amenities.My room rate included free buffet breakfast, which was a good start to the day. A good selection of American, European and Asian breakfast favourites - and pineapple.The hotel is a short walk to Waikiki beach and a slightly longer walk to the central Waikiki shopping district. It's a slightly longer walk to Ala Moana mall - but I found it too hot to do this. Fortunately, the hotel is very close to major bus routes, so it's a good place to be based if you haven't got a car.There's a small but well-stocked ABC convenience store in the hotel lobby, which is very useful for picking up things like sunscreen, snacks, beverages, sandwiches, etc.The only downside: the balcony doors are single glazed and aren't the best at keeping out traffic noise. The park side of the hotel faces two main roads, which seem to attract exuberant motorists on weekends. I sleep with earplugs so it wasn't really a problem, but it might be an issue for light sleepers.All up, Hotel Lacroix is in a good location and represents good value for those looking for basic hotel accommodation in Waikiki.

A special shoutout to Miles, Kiola, Hee from the cafe, and to Jody. They all made our stay very comfortable. Facilities wise this hotel isn't the best, but the comfort of the room and the staff made up for it. I also thought the $20 resort tax was nothing but a superflous tax. You do get $20 credited back if you have breakfast but out of our 8 days we only had breakfast 2 or 3 times as it gets super busy and the restaurant staff, as lovely as they are, struggle to cope with the traffic and volume. As a result omelettes take up to 25 minutes. The swimming pool during our stay was also closed. Location wise, it is great. A couple of minutes walk to downtown Waikiki, and also 10 minutes walk to the beach. They do free drinks for hotel staff everyday, but the opening times of this service are unreliable and inconsistent.

The room was large. I stayed in an ocean view room. I loved having 2 lanais. One faced right out to the ocean, the other was on the side of the room. Not as nice of a view, but was great to hide from the mid afternoon sun. The room was large and clean. The bed was comfortable. There were plenty of towels, lots of hot water in the shower and good water pressure. The breakfast was also good. Lots of different choices and well stocked. All the staff I encountered at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. The mid afternoon drinks were a nice added bonus. The pool was unfortunately closed for renovations, but they did make this clear when I was booking the room, so it wasn't a surprise to me. The location of the hotel was great, with quick walking access to the beaches, shops and restaurants, and it was easy to catch transit with many stops near by. Some right out the front of the hotel, other routes only a block or two away. There is a small ABC store on the main floor, and a whole bunch of larger ABC stores near by. I will definitely stay here next time I am in Waikiki.","Calgary, Canada","nikstravels123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",55,5.0

Perfectly matched the description given on web- always a plus. You want to pay for what you chose in advance so no disappointment on arrival. We messaged resort a few times prior to our arrival with some questions and requests. All promptly responded to and answered efficiently and with extra info to assist on our late night arrival, such as transfer info, restaurant recommendations, daily activities provided and in area. This is so helpful when you have not been to a destination- feels like someone else is as invested in your stay as you are. As we were also celebrating our milestone anniversary along with a milestone birthday, the staff arranged a lovely welcome with local flower petals and pretty towel display on bed- after a long flight it’s so nice to have such a lovely greeting and acknowledgement. We booked a Penthouse terrace with oversized which had an amazing oversized L-shape balcony overlooking parkland, with a beautiful ocean view. Part of balcony semi obstructed but non issue. We could easily see the stunning views afforded to this top floor room option. Our outdoor terrace/balcony provided 2 loungers along with locally inspired deck chair. The balcony is partially clad by artificial grass around edges to add a backyard feeling which we loved. Inside the room had soft, beach decor with huge flatscreen smart TV, queen size bed which was very comfortable. This is pet peeve of mine—A great night sleep must be as high on the hotel’s list of standards as it is for the guests. It can make a great hotel review turn sour if not. Loved the in rm Keurig coffee maker, coffee pod options with local flavours(yum- love my coffee) along with mini fridge that had both fridge and freezer sections. Great for you store snack, drinks ,baby food exec or the wine we brought for sipping on balcony during our stay! Wine glasses available- just ask the extremely professional and courteous staff at front desk and they will assist in anyway they can to help provide these little extras to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. Drawin checked us in and was extremely helpful and quick to advise hotel info, like breakfast (our included) times and options, gym, on site convenience store, atm, beach chair provisions, distance to attractions and sites etc. No questions were too tedious or repetitive for him. Darwin was efficient and his kind demeanour and courteous attitude prevailed over our constant interruptions to his knowledgeable dialogue. A true gift of patience and a warm welcome for sure!This is an older resort going through final phase of refurbishment and the attention to detail did not go “un-missed” by us. Beautiful and fresh. The pool was on last days of overhaul and opens early May. The rooms have been renovated and refreshed and bathrooms, although still looking dated were spotless and well equipped with local toiletries/amenities provided. 3 elevators ( another plus) for 16 floors is great too. Just a note to guess— luggage and wheelchair ramp provided into hotel and I assume handicap accessible rooms are available. Message in advance of booking and they will advise best rm option to accommodate your travel needs prior to your arrival. I travel with my 83 yr young parent at times and accessibility and comfort for these type of guests definitely require the attention to detail that must be met during their hotel stay.Location is “key” here as hotel , although in quiet area is literally about 2-3 short blocks walking distance to the core of Waikiki tourist area. T Galleries with high end stores along with local shops provide all style of ware for the “vacation shoppers “ and restaurants everywhere. Right out front hotel you can take one of the 4 main trolley options if you purchase tickets taking you to all points of interest from iconic Pearl Harbour, China town and historic Hawaiian Palace and Veterans Cemetery ( must see spots) onto Waikiki beach area then onwards to and up past Diamond head into Sandy Beach area - a 2 day all line s pass is $45.00 USD pp and worth it. Lower priced options available too or single use tickets. Buffet breakfast self service and loads of options catering to many types of guests needs and dietary requirements. Lounge area also provides complimentary coffee and teas all day.As of December the lounge offers complimentary alcoholic/ non alcoholic drinks from 12-5 Mon-Fri and 12-7 Sat and Sun! Wow- you don’t get that type of extra service amenities in most hotels anywhere!!  Non smoking rooms was a huge part of our choice of hotel, and when an issue of our room neighbours that opted ( maybe they forgot) to smoke on their balcony were quickly ( with a front desk call from me) and very politely asked to cease immediately. They were also advised a fee would be charged for smoking. I appreciate this attention to detail as many guests have this a a non negotiable standard in hotel choice. Non smoking and great wifi are top 5 “ must have”s” for me and my clients too. I don’t want to smell like smoke because of someone else’s neglect to the rule Just say...This has become a top contender for myself and my clients when choosing a altogether fantastic hotel in the Waikiki/Honolulu area for sure. Aloha and Mahalo to the amazing staff at La Croix. Ps..we are still here 1 ,ore day but wanted to share with you all in case you are considering a stay— pick this Gem. You will love it too.:).

Breakfast was included in the rate. The restaurant was very chaotic and we didn't get the omelets that we ordered. They let too many people in at a time and many folks were left standing in the middle of the restaurant waiting for a table to become available - very awkward.

My bathroom was not clean at all, there were so many hairs in the tub, on the bathroom counter- I should have changed rooms then! Sunday I wake up and notice two bite marks right across my wrists and my ankles were very itchy. I googled what it could be because it did not have noticeable puncture marks.... turns out to be bedbugs. I called them immediately and was able to change rooms- and to my amazement, the new room's bathroom is just as debatable as my last. I asked for three blankets, just so I could lay on top of the blankets and pray to not be bitten again.I contact the front desk asking for a manager and was connected with a Olvia. When they transferred my room they said they would have Pest Control come the next day and confirm if it was bed bugs. I literally had to beg them to provide me ointment or reimb for my itching and swelling. I practically had to slightly raise my voice, before one of the staff members gave me $20 in a change to wash all my clothes (had to ask for that too;then i had to ask for soap as if she thought i was going to use air) When changing rooms, they provided me with trash bags to put my clothes in, but the laundry room was already closed for the night)Without providing all examples of their poor service. I will leave it like this. You can get bed bugs at any 5-star hotel. My issue is the poor service and the way they handled the situation that wasted 2 days of my business trip limping due to the pain and unable to enjoy any activities I had planned. After multiple phone calls to see if the report showed bed bugs, they say it did not but the report only showed that he was in the room for 7 mins (not sure if i should be impressed or if this was shady) I contacted Orkin myself and they explained it would take a minimum of 30 mins to clean the room and stated they would have someone come back out. I notified Olvia that they were coming back, and THAT is when she proceeded to tell me something was wrong with the tech's tablet and could not record the time (then why did'nt you say that when you gave me the report??!! aka SHADY). Then an Anne tries to call me stating she is from accounts and is off-site (not sure the purpose of this call or her position), but loved how she randomly appeared onsite to hand me the final inspection form. At the end of the day, I could not wait to leave the next day. In my previous counter conversations with Olivia, and me stating I was going to the doctor she asked if the doctor confirmed if it was bed bugs (are you now wanting to confess your lies??!!). I guess I was lucky enough to not have as many bites as the other feb postThe food was average but it least it was there.

The hotel used to be the Waikiki Gateway Hotel and the new owners have spared no expense in refurbishing and upgrading the rooms and lobby. The rooms were clean, neat and quiet. The entire staff seemed to be working extra hard to make your stay enjoyable. It was just a short (5 min.) walk across a beautiful park to Waikiki Beach. The Hotel had beach chairs, surf boards, boogie boards and snorkel gear available free to the guests. Each morning there was a cooked-to-order breakfast buffet available and each evening they had a happy hour in the breakfast room. There was a convenient ABC Store (look them up) just off the lobby to purchase beverages, snacks, souvenirs, clothing, etc. I would highly recommend Hotel La Croix.

The hotel is older but it is obvious it has been updated including large flatscreen televisions and wood flooring in the rooms except right next to the beds. A couple of suggestions about the rooms would be a dresser as we prefer to not live out of our suitcases and while the repurposed entertainment unit was great for table top space there wasn't space to unpack and a towel bar would allow for towels to be reused, the hooks did not allow them to dry properly and a ring for the hand towel would be nice give the small vanity. These things are minor though and did not detract from our stay. Let me be honest in saying that this is a busy area of Honolulu which makes it easy to get around, but that also means there is a lot of traffic and thusly traffic noise including sirens which was pretty much an everyday occurrence, however you will find this in any hotel in the downtown area. Pluses to this hotel we had a lightbulb out which was replaced when we asked. Because it is an older hotel, there are not many plugs so my husband moved out the credenza and plugged in a small 3 plug power strip so we could keep our electronics charged, we came in the next day and housekeeping or maintenance had put in one in its spot with 6 plugs and 3 USB chargers which was very attentive to our needs without us asking. Housekeeping by the way was awesome. The hotel has a breakfast buffet daily, normal cost is $16.50 a person but with the amenities fee you get a $20 credit towards breakfast so it was like $12 a day for the two of us. A wide variety of foods were offered daily and it changed a bit from day to day so you didn't get tired if the same old things each day. While the fried rice was a bit different for a breakfast offering, it soon became our favorite. Where this hotel really shines is in the staff, the front desk staff was amazing and each day as we got our towels from them and ordered our chairs and umbrella they were happy to assist. Roland the morning parking valet was always helpful and in fact each of the valets went out of their way to load our chairs and umbrella in the car before bringing it to us, a very nice touch. Miles the security guard was friendly and courteous. The shining star however was Yasmin, the bartender for the COMPLIMENTARY cocktail time this hotel offers. She was sweet, sassy, and fun to talk with. In addition to the free drinks there were also light snacks which was nice to enjoy before heading out to dinner on the town or for the fireworks on the beach. I know people complain about the amenities fee, but for $20 a day it helped cut the cost of our breakfast down to $12 for two people and we never had to rent chairs and an umbrella at the many beaches we visited (which by the way was $36 for 2 chairs and and umbrella daily). We also prepaid our parking when we made our reservation which gave us a discount on that as well. There is an ABC store (convenience store) attached to the hotel that offers a wide range of food, drinks, beach apparel, souvenirs, and even alcohol. We loved our stay here and plan to stay again the next time we are in Oahu. P.S. the hotel also has a guest laundry and while the pool was under renovation, we didn't miss it. There are way too many beaches to enjoy to sit at a pool. Picture taken from one of our two balconies.

A malfunctioning TV remote, to give just one example, was replaced within minutes by a maintenance employee who came to our room after we notified the desk.The hotel itself is located directly in the center of Waikiki, but tucked a few blocks further back from the beach. Most rooms have either a city view or an obstructed ocean view, but this is to be expected of a three-star resort with such reasonable pricing. A plenitude of high-end shopping and mid-range restaurants are within a few blocks in any direction. It is recommended that you explore more economical parking options than what the hotel offers, including a convenient one just across the street.The hotel currently runs a discounted breakfast buffet; an impressive variety of prepared food for 12 bucks a person — we enjoyed the atmosphere and the energy brought by the other guests along with the great food.The room is the only reason we can’t give this experience five stars. We requested a room with one queen bed, under the mistaken assumption that the absence of a second bed would mean more space to move around. This strategy backfired, and it turns out that a room with one queen bed is half the size of a room with two queen beds, even though both are listed at comparable prices. Our room was so small that there wasn’t even sufficient space to put bedside stands. This means: nowhere to set your phone, nowhere to hit a light switch within reach of lying down, place the TV/AC remote, etc. In addition, our bed may have been a full-size bed, not a queen as was advertised. Our room didn’t come with a microwave, but one was promptly brought upon request. We were grateful for the quality and versatility of the air-conditioner, which also helped rid the room of a slight mildew smell. (The hallway, at least on the 10th floor, smelled really funky.) And as for the bed itself, what can I say? It was squishy as you would expect many regular mattresses to be. Neither of us slept very well during our five-night stay, but in comparison to sleeping on our Tempur-pedic at home, perhaps this is to be expected.To be fair, if we had brought our bed concerns to the attention of the staff after the first night, they probably would have moved heaven and earth to get us a firmer and higher-quality mattress, or even switch us to a bigger room. But given how miraculously they accommodated us with a last-minute Holiday reservation, we were simply grateful to be there and considered it out of place to make further demands.","San Francisco, California","Casey C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",5,4.0

He's always acknowledging everyone with a consistent friendly Hawaiian smile & Aloha He's by far the HEART of this hotel..... It would definitely not be the same if he wasn't there!!! I Know that with full confidence The breakfast is very very good, great spread lots of options & variety, very tasty!!! Foufou makes sure all the guests are happy & enjoying, with her caring nurturing energy.At the end of the day the beautiful Canadian bartender Yasmine takes care of you, her fun nature, magnetic personality & Charisma is contagious!!!! She brings so much life & love into the lounge with wonderful conversation The hotel itself is clean the beds are comfy but it's not fancy, but all we needed. The hotel is under renovation with no pool but they are allowing guests to go to a hotel down the street and use their pool which is conveniently located. We had one day where the renovation required to have no water in the hotel but they did compensate for us which was deeply appreciated!If it wasnt for these fine 7 staff members my Mother & I experience there wouldn't have been anywhere near fantastic time that it was. I will truly miss each one of these individuals, we connected so well with! I consider them my Hawaiian family now! Mahalo & Aloha Miss you guys already!!!

The breakfast is good, with all the standard items, also has a good omelette station.They give you beach towel card to exchange for the towel, as long as you return the towel, no charge will be added.The most expensive part is the parking, $29/night for unlimited in & out access, it only comes with valet parking, no self-serves, and since this is the first time I am in Hawaii, I did not bother looking for anything else, but for sure I will do that for next time.Experience:1. Finding the valet parking was a bit difficult since the entrance to valet parking is not on the same side as the front door, plus the hotel name not the same and the one way street around the block, it wasn't that great experience to start off with.2. Parking, once you get to the parking lot, the staff was very helpful. He helped with the luggage as well calling another staffs to move all the luggage to our room 3. Checking-in, it was simple and easy, given our reservation has multiple rooms and people are coming in at different time, the front desk staff was very nice to explain everything (actually to the point with every details), but I was so hungry at that time and did not pay too much attention.4. Hotel room, typical size hotel room, I didn't expect too much for the amenities given with the great location and it's price. But it does need some basic upgrades, such as missing coffee machine, more stable wifi, and the most important of all, there is no vent in the washroom, which is quite a disappointment. (Also, it was raining in Waikiki on Saturday, and my friend's room has water dripping from the ceiling)5. Daily activities, they actually provide a lot of items for free, from umbrellas to water equipment such as surf board, and also doing a good providing activities information in Waikiki and around Oahu island.6. Cleanliness, I recommend bringing your own towel for drying after shower and flip flops. Not that I see any problems, but my ankles has small bite mark after I walked around barefoot for the first 2 nights. I cannot confirm if the bites are from the hotel or outside, so I am not going to penalize them for it.7. Checking out, simple transaction, front desk provided all the explanation of the charged items, but this is where I think the hotels earned a lot of points.Good Experience:So after I checked out, they called a staff member to help with the luggage from the room back to the car. The staff name is Lucy. A, and she literally helped with everything without my help. Then my wife was having concern if the luggage is over weight, and I said we have no way to tell until we get to the airport. Lucy then when downstairs and bring a scale back to weight our luggage, and one of them was indeed over weight. So, we know we will need to transfer some items from one to the other, she then offered help but given with so much private items, we declined her request and she left. We then went back inside the room to re-organize, and as we are about to finish and call the front desk again, Lucy came back to the door and ask if everything is done. We were amazed that she took her time to come back and check on us to make sure everything is ok. She then moved everything downstairs to parking and onto the car, initially I was afraid that it won't fit because with the extra items we got in Hawaii, but then she magically fitted everything inside the car. I am pretty amazed with her ability, but more importantly, her willingness to go above and beyond for making sure all the guests in the hotel have a pleasant time. Thank you very much for offering such a service, and I will recommend this hotel to my family & friends in the future given with the wonderful service and excellent location, but I would really recommend they can do minor upgrades to their amenities.","Toronto, Canada","Rex_Fung</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",1,4.0

The room was clean and everything was in good working order. The bed was more comfortable than expected (my expectations for hotel beds are extremely low). The location is walking distance from the beach, shopping, and some primo Japanese food. The pool is currently closed for renovations, but who goes to Hawaii for the hotel pools? Unfortunately, that came with some needle gun noise, but not a big deal. There was a happy hour on Friday (free drinks) which I really, really took advantage of. Super fun time!

We were staying at the outrigger reef, but decided it was too expensive to stay any longer. We knew this hotel was being renovated but the reviews had said that it was good and staff were nice. As the price was reasonable and in a good location to still be able to get to the beach quickly we went with it! Roughly £100 a night including taxes. We were on the 7th floor and the room looked clean and fresh, but on closer inspection we had several issues with the room. Worst of which was the singleGlazing patio door which when closed there was still a large gap and this let in a-lot of traffic noise from the busy Kalakaua avenue. The curtains didn’t meet properly and the hook when i pulled the curtains to close came off in my hand. The laundry room had 2 washing machines and 2 dryers not enough for the size of the hotel and there was no change machine or ability to buy washing powder. We had to go to the front desk for quarters and luckily had soap powder already. The staff were lovely especially the bell hop on the first day we arrived! (Im sorry i have forgotten his name, believe began with a K). The ability to have beach towels and beach equipment for free was a big plus and i made use of these, including taking the snorkelling gear to Hanauma Bay saving me $12 on hiring equipment there! The hotel is in a great location has an ABC downstairs and is a 5minute walk to the main shops and bars.However this hotel is in need of a-lot of renovation.

The room we had had been refurbished and was to a good standard. Although some inconsiderate fool had managed to get two large blobs of chewing gum on the carpet. Room light and airy, some traffic noise as small veranda doors are single glazed. Upgraded and newly decorated bathroom let down by old bath, tiles and soap dish painted over with white paint which was scraped in numerous places and looked tatty and distracted from the new basin unit and w.c. As pool was not accessible we had use of nearby hotel pool which was nice and within a few minutes walk, even for old timers like us.Multiple bus and trolley services run right past the hotel. Good central location within easy walk of Waikiki Beach, shopping and restaurants. Easy access for public transport to Malls and sightseeing. Breakfast buffet, although offering a somewhat limited choice was good and more than sufficient.

Having the ABC convenience store in the lobby was very handy for picking up a few things when I needed them.Having read some of the previous reviews I was a bit concerned before I came but this was unfounded. With the Gateway / La Croix you get what you pay for. Waikiki isn’t a cheap place to stay and its completely unfair to compare this hotel to luxury hotels further into the centre of Waikiki that cost three of four times more a night. You pay your money and you take your choice.It’s a bit of a stroll to restaurants etc. but no more than 5 or 10 minutes. Handy for the convention centre in the other direction though if that’s why you are coming to Waikiki.Some street noise but it never bothered my sleep.My only concern was a break in at a low level room that happened whilst I was staying. Someone apparently climbed up a ladder and came in through the balcony and grabbed some valuables that weren’t in the safe. The good news was the staff managed to confront the intruder and he fled leaving everything behind.

Granted, we had a large SUV, but if you advertise valet parking, you better have it. After numerous conversations with the parking attendent and the front desk, they suddenly found a spot for the car. The rooms were not good. We had 2 separate rooms; One with 2 queen size beds and only 2 towels; no tissues; cracks in the walls and showers. The other was the 4 twin beds-which as my son stated the beds were like bean bags. They advertise beach towels, but they ran out. Front desk staff were nice, but nice doesn't cut it when everything else was poor. They also put a $100 hold on my credit card for any incidentals - which they said could be a pending item for about a month. Not too thrilled with that either.

When we booked we were told we would get a $20 credit for the breakfast buffet each morning. I barely eat breakfast so we figured this would be fine. What they don't tell you is that each person's visit to the breakfast buffet costs $15.95, so really, you aren't getting anything - you will have to pay. The credit is *per room*, so unless you are staying alone, you are not getting breakfast included here, and there is no way to stay below $20, even if one of you only wants tea. Our final bill also had a $20/night ""NEW amenity fee!"" in addition to the usual resort fee, and when we asked what it included, they listed items that are completely standard even at the Motel 6, like the fridge, TV, and room safe.2) Our room may have been cleaned but it was musty and old. Our lampshade had mildew all over it and the bathroom was gross - the shower floor was so dirty that I wanted to wear my socks while showering.

Also the balconies weren’t inviting to sit on at all. A little bit of the railing has come off and the air conditioning unit was dripping down onto the balcony.

It is reasonably priced compared to many of its neighbours, but those thinking they've found an outright bargain should beware that the photos of the ""remodelled"" rooms build expectations that aren't quite met. This is (I would estimate) a 1950's building that is in need of serious attention, not just cosmetic. Everything from the crumbling popcorn ceilings to the wiring to the glazing is old and tired. And while the rooms are redecorated in nice colours and decent furniture, they haven't really addressed these deeper issues. There are many visible signs of deterioration, particularly on the balconies and railings. In the pool area, rather than repair / replace the corroded railings they've just put painted ply / chip-board in front of them to give the illusion of new. The balcony immediately above the swimming pool is scarily bowing in the middle, and doesn't look at all safe to me. I wouldn't sit on it. Speaking of the swimming pool, it is very small and the goes from 3ft to 7ft in just a few steps. Wouldn't really be suitable for inexperienced swimmers or young kids.Our room seemed clean enough when we first checked-in, but by the end of our five-night stay the sheets hadn't been changed, the bathroom was being cleaned on the sink only and amenities refreshed while the toilet/bath/floor/walls hadn't been cleaned once. The mouldy ceiling and dirty grouting around the bathroom tiles made it feel even grubbier. Its location means there is a LOT of traffic and the noise of this goes on nearly all night, so if you're a light sleeper you may struggle. On the plus side, we heard no noise from other occupants and the rooms are spacious with pleasant furniture and with nice views.If you really want to be in this area and can't justify the cost of many of the alternatives, this hotel is ok as long as you don't expect the quality that the hotel is trying to convey via its marketing.

The rooms were definitely more spacious then other similar hotels. The hotel is old but is currently undergoing transformation into a boutique hote. Rooms were recently refreshed and furnishings were new (except the shower/bathware). The hotel was nice enough to provide us a cot for the baby on request. We really loved the location of the hotel. It was close to the shops in Waikiki but also remained within walking distance to the Hawaiian convention centre and Ala Moana Centre. There was a convenience store just downstairs where we could find most essential stuff. The beach was not too far away, though our only gripe was the $20 amenity fee for a hotel not directly in front of the beach. They made up for this with $20 breakfast credit (cost $16pp) but they don't allow accumulating credit. We ended up paying a $12 top up for two people. The hotel was also directly across from a park which leads to the historical Battery Randolph/Army museum - def worth a visit (free entry). If you are not renting a car, most tours offer pick up from this hotel as there is a tour bus waiting bay downstairs. This might be an issue if you are a light sleeper as the sound insulation from the balcony is poor. Also the wifi provided by the hotel was horrible and kept dropping out. We had best signals in the bathroom.. but it wasn't a deal-breaker as we had a tourist sim card. Overall, it was the excellent cleanliness, housekeeping, comfort and amenities that won us over. Our only regret was not staying here for the whole 2 weeks we spent in Hawaii!","Melbourne, Australia","Jeremiah L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",38,5.0

Objectively, the only thing they weren’t too great about was their vallet parking. The attendants there were not very organized or attentive to detail because they mixed up all our luggage and sent them to the wrong rooms. Also, the common bathroom next to the lobby didn’t have soap for our entire stay. When we brought it to their attention, they didnt make it a priority to fix. They finally did, on our last day there.

I can’t say enough good things about this hotel. We booked the 777 deal. 7 days, penthouse with huge lanai, 7 day car rental included and 7 day free parking. Totally worth the money. They are still renovating the hotel to turn it into the La Croix Hotel. But, we never had any issues hearing construction. The breakfast buffet was half price during our stay. It was decent, but with all of the choices in the area we only ate there twice. The hotel staff was incredible and so accommodating. They give you two (or how many are in your room) key cards for beach towels so you don’t have to buy and deal with the sand all in your room. The valet guys were so awesome and gave us wonderful suggestions to go try. Easiest thing to do is do your day trips around the island in your personal car and Uber at night time. The location is perfect. Walking distance to everything, 5 minutes to the beach, just across the park. Everything is close especially H1 East and West which will put you close to any beach on the island. There is a travel agency on level 3 to help you fix up any tours you want to go on since buying online can be difficult especially if the weather is undetermined.

There was no desk for my computer (nor room for one). There was no place to charge phones. The room was clean and neat, but spartan -- it reminded me of European budget hotels. There was a $20/night ""resort"" fee we did not expect in spite of the hotel being blocks from the beach.","Boston, Massachusetts","MarkLOlson</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",114,1.0

Within walking distance from everything you come to Waikiki for. Arriving on a friday night, I was the last reservation to check in. Darwin (at the front desk) suprised me with an upgrade to a Penthouse Terrace room. #3. He said he thought I would like this room. He wasn't kidding. Top of the building with an amazing view of Waikiki. My room was a corner room so I had 2 sliders and a large ""L"" shaped balcony. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The Breakfast Buffet, which Darwin also included, was great, and very convieniant. I've been to Waikiki quite a few times. Always looking for good deals on rooms.

Mr. Darwin S. assisted us with our reservations once again. He arranged that we had a very comfortable spacious room to accommodate our big family. The room he got us was a newly renovated room on the 8th floor in the corner end and it had 2 big beds and 2 balconies. The high-speed wifi worked this time around. We were very satisfied with our stay again I must say. Darwin is a very personable guy and always caring of your needs. He is truly such an assest to the hotel. Like I’ve said in my past review, I stay at many 3-5 star hotels weekly for work but this hotel stands out and it keeps me and my family coming back.Typical Waikiki Gateway Hotel fashion, during our stay there, we were recieved with friendly greetings in the morning by the lovely ladies in the front desk. Then, we would walk straight to breakfast area and be greeted daily with a smile by the sweetest breakfast staff Haley and Grace. Breakfast buffet is so tasty my kids look forward to it every morning. That’s all they remembered when we stayed there last time was the breakfast. For me, I liked the fried rice, scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, miso soup, and the iced passion fruit-orange juice. After breakfast, Miles who is head security who’s a big dude would greet my kids with a smile and talk to them. Warren who’s is valet would greet us and chat with us when getting our van in the basement garage. When we would sometimes hit the Waikiki beach 5 minutes walk away, we’d loan beach chairs from the front desk ladies.Importantly, what makes us come back to this hotel first and foremost is the personable-friendly-accomodating staff. Without them, we would not stay here for real. It makes a world of a difference. Second, is the location. It’s at the beginning of Waikiki, so the hustle and bustle of tourists is not found here making it quiter than further down the street. Convenience is all around the hotel such as the ABC store in the hotel itself, tons of restaurants nearby, retail stores down the street, a park across the street, and bus stop in front which we took to/from the airport (The Bus #19, #20 for $2.75 o/w or $5 for aday pass). There is really no need for a car rental unless you plan to drive around the island which did. But if you plan to stay at the Waikiki area only, then the Waikiki Gateway is the perfect location for that. But great job again Waikiki Gateway hotel. We can’t wait to come back again soon...","Newport, Rhode Island","jspilot31</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newport, Rhode Island</strong>",3,5.0

Moderate street noise which I personally had no problems with (earplugs if you're a very light sleeper).Location - Very convenient. 7min walk from the Royal Hawaiian Center, 25min walk to Ala Moana Mall.

Mahalo Mhila for all the help.The location was just a short walk to the beach and was central to nearly every activity we planned and did. We rented scooters for 1 week and toured the southern part of the island and had a ball. Parking at the hotel was convenient, but pricey in my opinion, but space is a premium of an island.

The staff had us in a room by 11 am. CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH how appreciated that was. The rooms themselves are pretty basic, but then again, the price is good. The coffee maker in our unit was malfunctioning a bit, and we noticed basic cosmetic things that could be fixed/repaired. But the air conditioner worked and the room was clean - that's all we really cared about. They already had a crib in the room as requested for my daughter.

There was hardwood laminate flooring, along with carpet around the beds, which were comfortable. The room had a nice HD TV, and decent selection of channels. The dresser and night stand were basic/older (maybe to be replaced as part of renovations?). The fridge came in handy. The bathroom had a nice-sized vanity. The tub was old, but the shower had good shower pressure. Would have been nice to have a few more cloths. Hot water was limited at times. There was some sound transfer from adjacent rooms.  The balcony was spacious enough - there were a couple worn out patio chairs (maybe to be replaced also?).The pool area was tidy. It was not very modern. The pool was very small, as was the pool area, but it was not crowded as many guests would enjoy the sun from their balconies or go to the beach. There was a nice view from the pool deck, onto Kalakaua Avenue, Fort DeRussy Park, in the direction of the ocean.We did not partake in the breakfast buffet, nor did we use the laundry room. We did make use of the beach chairs and umbrella (included as hotel amenities), which we took to the beach. This was a nice feature.The location of the hotel is great; only a few blocks away from the busier part of Waikiki with its restaurants and shops, but far enough away from that same commotion. The beach is a nice walk away (about 10 to 15 minutes), through Fort DeRussy Park. There is a small ABC on the main floor, and a Dean & Deluca just 1 block away, at the Ritz-Carlton. A turn-off during our stay - there was a sewer smell throughout the property, and it was very noticeable in our room each time we entered, for the first few minutes until our noses adjusted to it. The City was apparently having problems with the sewer lines during our stay which may have lead to some gas unfortunately backing up into the hotel room. Generally speaking, this property still looks and smells old in places, but you can tell there is renovation work ongoing, and they are working hard to freshen up the place, likely as part of the rebranding.

The hotel seems to have been fairly newly renovated, so generally modern and up to date. Our room was a bit on the small side which was disappointing, as we felt a bit cramped at times.

The room was clean and comfortable with good AC and a TV with full range of cable channels. Also, the free high-speed internet was a great bonus. All windows/doors were just single-pane so we had to contend with a lot of road noise which was annoying. There is a small gym on the first floor with lots of new equipment. All of the cardio gear is new and high quality, but the weights equipment is very limited. The room itself is tiny with no space to do any floor work, and effectively only about 1-2 people can lift weights at any one time.

We were in Waikiki beach for 3 nights. We thought that compared to other hotels in the area, the Gateway was reasonably priced.The quality of the hotel was great. We had a room with 2 balconies! Our room was clean and spacious. It had a fridge and small kitchenette (sink, dishes, microwave, etc). The kitchen was stocked with some silverware, plates, and glasses. There is no corkscrew, but the front desk will happily open your wine for you. The service at this hotel is something that all of the other reviews mention and we would absolutely agree with this. The staff were helpful and friendly to us the entire time we were there. The A/C works well and keeps the room quite cool. The hotel was quiet enough that sleep was not disrupted, but there is some street noise. It didn't bother us at all, but if you sleep with the windows open I guess it could. It seemed to me that street noise started quite early in Hawaii. They seem to be early risers!What we didn't know about this hotel before we booked was that it also offers a very good breakfast buffet for a subsidized price ($5.95/day for hotel guests). I don't think you could find a breakfast of that quality for that price anywhere else in the area. We ate there daily for breakfast and really appreciated this. We felt the location of this hotel was very convenient. Waikiki beach is full of tourist attractions - restaurants, shops, etc. This hotel was definitely not far from anything (including bus stops). The beach was also quite a short walk. The one thing that we were not quite as impressed with was the ""hotel service/amenity fee"" charged to us at check-out. The hotel added $80 on to our bill at check-out stating that we had agreed to it when checking in to our room (although they could not show us where in the agreement we had signed up for this). We ended up working this out in the end, but just be aware that this could happen and pay attention to the final charges. It is too bad that this happened, because I wanted to give the hotel a perfect review, but I just couldn't. Otherwise our stay was fantastic with no complaints!","Ottawa, Canada","Kaitlyn221</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",41,4.0

Beware of the room size on the lower levels. We barely had room to swing a cat but were moved when we asked due to the dripping taps and the noisy fridge. The facilities are pretty poor with only one washing machine to service the entire 17 floors. There were two driers however. The gym wasn't of much use to the more sporty people so they went to another facility nearby. The pool was very small and cloudy. It didn't get many visitors in the two weeks I was there. There were five old sun loungers that were sore on the back as the steel protruded. The most annoying thing I suppose is the general amenities tax you are charged as you check out. While most hotels charge this fee I would hope that the ""amenities"" were better elsewhere. A major plus for this hotel was the staff. They were all very friendly and helpful.

In Hawai'i friendliness seems to be in the water and, being a somewhat reserved Brit, I wondered if it would grate, but it didn't because for the vast majority of my stay, all smiles seemed to come from the heart. One of the best examples of that was my housekeeper, Mhila Talledo; I only saw her once, at the end of my stay by accident in the corridor but she was so lovely and sweet. She kept my room spotlessly clean and well made up. Thank you, Mhila :-) The rooms are fine, with great views out towards Honolulu (on my side of the building), but definitely not all sea views, just so you know (it's over a kilometre to the water I think.

Sausages were awesome :-) There is an amenities charge (optional) which, if you only ever take advantage of the breakfast part probably isn't worth it; do the maths before you agree to it.

Mahalo ( welcome) was the first thing I heard from the front desk. And across from it was a big jug of ice lemon and lime water. 3 large suite case and 2 small ones, hot and tired that picture was refreshing. Checking in was a breeze, and the staff were very helpful and offered to take our cases to our room. Well it was a dive from here on. The room was dated, small and very hot, the AC was to small to even cool down the room, it was a corner room with 2 balconies that didn’t help prevent the heat from coming in. The bathroom was dirty, floor had lint’s and hair, it needed a good scrub down. Carpet needed vacuuming. On the fifth floor so it was noisy with the traffic. Needless to say I was at the front desk letting them know. So the staff were very apologetic and offered the get us another room except it was smaller and no kitchenette and the same size AC this did not cut it for me, it’s not what I booked for. So they offer to thoroughly clean the room and give the AC a chance to cool the room. While we went out for lunch. On our return the room was a little cleaner and a little cooler. So we requested that the AC be left on all day everyday during our stay and the room be kept clean. Small request for au$ 980 for 4 days.

Like many other mentioned the breakfast is the big plus in the hotel, plenty of food and a nice start of the day that you don't have to go somewhere else. As you probably know the prices are really high in the island, so you can save a lot with the breakfast. If you traveling with children they have tubes, boards that left by another guest in the hotel , and they offering you to used them for free !!! Also , they have almost everyday transportation opportunities to the famous sites for free ( $10 tips recommended ), they give you the schedule when you check in. Front desk area has a two type of water to drink all day long for free as well. About 10 minutes walk from the beach. Beach offers sand and grass area as well witch is nice. Almost all hotels let you in to eat or their pool with no problem. There is one hotel for the military families that has the best prices in the beach , and they welcome everybody at night they have live music as well.

The beds were comfortable. It is on a major street so there is some street noise but nothing out of the ordinary. The bathroom was not too convenient in that it lacks shelf space but it was large enough. Everything is in one room, however..the tub/shower and the sink. The free breakfast was the best! It is a buffet with everything one could want, hot food, cold food, great coffee, lots of fruit...excellent. Parking in the hotel basement is expensive, but hotel guests get a discount.

The location is perfect, it is located right in the heart of the city. You do not need to drive a car or take a taxi to move around. Everything is walking distance, close proximity to the beach, bus / trolley stops, restaurants, bars, convenience stores, post office, parks, souvenir shops, laundromat and many more. When you take the bus, an automated announcement will let you know that it is the stop for the hotel. Isn't that great .4. The WiFi signal is booming ! I was already at the bus stop and still was able to get a signal from the hotel lobby. Although Wifi from Holiday Inn Express across the street and Hawaiian Telecom were good options too3. We stayed at the 14th floor with the ocean view. The room that we stayed in was clean. The linen, the pillows, the towels in the bathroom and the bathroom itself looked sparklingly clean. The air conditioner was a work horse. it was a searing 95 degree Fahrenheit outside but perfectly cool inside my room. The Television is full packed with on demand cable channels. The shower pressure was okay and switching water temperature from cold to warm was an instant. .2. The Buffet Breakfast is laden with freshly sliced fruits, salads, juices ( passion / orange / guava fruit juice was awesome ), Hawaiian coffee, breads and hard boiled eggs. They also have this do-it-yourself waffle. 1. And my number 1 reason why you have to stay in this hotel is because of their employees . Specially QILI who always has this great smile when you pass by the lobby in the morning . She was very helpful and very informative to us since it was our first time in the city. We saved a lot of dollars in transportation alone due to her numerous suggestions. She deserve a far more better position in what she's doing . right now. She is smart and always has this warm smile on her face. it was really a pleasure doing business with her.I also want to mention DARWIN, another fine young fellow. Always polite and was patient in dealing with an irate customer. i wasn't the irate customer but i saw how he handled the matter . Also, very informative and gave us valuable suggestions on how to enjoy the city. A wholesome person in many ways. He works the midnight shift and all works well when he is in charge. I also want to add CAMMY, the manager who did some magic in moving us from the 9th floor to the 14th floor. Although I made this booking five months in advance. The sales representative assured me that my room is reserved with the ocean view on the 15th floor.And I wont forget ALTON, the maintenance guy who assisted me when i was fixing some of my stuff .Reasons why you should skip this hotel and go elsewhere.1. Sorry, I cannot provide any reason . I will stay in this hotel again for sure. And will spread the news to my friends , to the friends of my friends and to the friends of their friends.Some minor letdowns :a) Made this reservation 5 months in advance with a certain Ms Lumantas , hotel sales rep. The deal was, we're supposed to have a room on the 15th floor with a view of the Pacific Ocean, the city, equipped with a kitchenette and breakfast included. On the day of our check-in. They assigned us at the 9th floor where you can hardly see the ocean. Although the city view was fine. Of course I brought this to their attention. Cammy did some adjustments and we were moved to the 14th floor the following dav . This time we had a better view of the ocean and the city view was awesome. The room has no kitchenette , but it is okay since, who cares about the kitchenette when you are there to enjoy the Hawaiian foods outside. b) The cabinet where the HDTV stands has dust build up. It was very evident ! I think the last time they cleaned this cabinet was when Nixon was still the president of the USA. Shared the matter to the front desk and they fixed the problem.c) Once, I stayed at the balcony / terrace and i can smell a cigarette smoke. Perhaps somebody is smoking at the other room. I hope they can make this a complete smoke - free building someday.Some suggestions:The security guy who works in the grave yard shift is like a robot, I think his name is hiram. never greet any hotel guests . Never smile , never friendly. Serious type of person. I guess it coincides with the nature of his job. But just to give him a refresher, the hotel guests provide the business, they are the main reason why you have this thing called paycheck. It won't take a lot of effort just to say hello to them. Laundry room should be open 'til, at least, 10 pm .At lease once a week , they should include an omelette , bacon, hot dogs and corned beef in their breakfast menu. This is my honest review , check my photos, i hope Trip Advisor won't delete any of them . Whatever you see in the picture is what you may get if you decided to stay here.","Los Angeles, California","AikenJoshAndrew</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",97,4.0

I have a tendency to note what is not that good, so you are warned :)Room:Pros:- The room has a good size for 2 people (had a 2 queen beds room)- The room is clean- The room is quiet enough to be able to sleep and not always hear your neighbor. You do hear the AC but is an OK background white noise.- Bed is comfortable, although the pillow could be a little bit more comfy.Bads:- The room and the balcony would need a little renovation since part of the balcony were chipping of. The bathroom could also receive a beauty touch up.- The air conditioning would need a clean up or a to be replaced, since it's shootingcold-ish air but was not really removing humidity. The room was at an ok temperature but could have been colder if humidity was less present.- They're not many electric plugs in the room (found only 3 that were available)Staff:- Everyone was super friendly. You need something, they are all happy to help you with a smile! Big ++- Front desk almost always have at least 2 persons. You don't wait long for service there. - I had an issue with my safe not working. I had both the security guy named Miles Smiles and the repair guy named Ramon (I think, I'm not 100% sure) coming the the room and trying to fix it a few minute after raising the problem. Both were super friendly and social! - I also had a housekeeper named Mhila Talledo. Super friendly and kind. Was taking a few seconds almost each morning to say good morning to everyone on the floor when they would go out. Even though I didn't needed housekeeping, she was always asking me if I needed anything and would give me any supplies I was missing.- There was also a super nice and beautiful women at the breakfast that was doing the placement of the people. Super friendly and funny in some rush moment.Services:- The breakfast buffet is small and have little variety. It greatly miss any kind of meat. Also, the open hours were not big, so if your a late sleeper, you will probably miss it.Watch out, like some hotels in the US, the are extra fees that are not always shown on reservation site.

Princess was more than helpful, friendly and patient with all of my concerns and questions. She put me at ease and I felt secure reserving a room for their one week stay in Waikiki. Every time I called the hotel to speak with someone (which was many), EVERYONE was kind and more than generous with their time, making sure all my questions or concerns were answered and assuring me they had kept an eye on my girls. My daughters had a wonderful time exploring Waikiki & found this hotel to be convenient in its location. They loved the staff. They enjoyed the room immensely and felt more than comfortable. My daughters returned home safe and happy. I'd like to mention I was beyond impressed with Kai. His professionalism, kindness, generosity and aloha was beyond what I expected.

The position is ideal as it's a ten minute stroll from the heart of Waikiki. This was my fourth trip to Hawaii & I over it there. Extra costsSurprise! Be aware that your the advertised cost of your room is only the beginning. There is also USD $20 Guest Amenity fee charged on a daily basis. Not only that, you have to pay 4.712 % Sales Tax daily plus Transient Accommodations Tax 9.25% every single day. Beware! This bumps up the price of your accomodation significantly. Lobby The lobby area is modern & there are three lifts which make getting up to your room fairly easy. The water dispensers in the lobby are a nice touch. The roomThe beds were comfortable & the air conditioning worked well. The furniture was functional but worn. The safe did not work at all & despite reporting it to the front desk, nothing was done. Yes, they offered for us to keep our things in the hotel safe but this wasn't exactly convenient. Our room safe should have been repaired that day. Not good enough when you are spending hundreds of dollars per night. The hotel was built in 1970 & I don't think the bathroom in room 713 has been renovated since. In a nutshell, very basic, tired & worn out. PoolThe pool was tiny but clean. Not very inviting to sit around with limited room & one area completely sealed off as it's needing repair. Breakfast It was back to the 70's with the decor in the breakfast area. The food was fresh & there was plenty of variety. The queues to be seated were often 10-15 minutes long which was very annoying. The worst part was the music they played in the buffet area. It was the same CD every single day and it's really not difficult to mix it up. Housekeeping Housekeeping came every day very late in the afternoon around 5pm. They were always polite & friendly but didn't clean things without being explicitly told to do so. I found this staggering- surely you don't need to ask for the bins to be emptied, towels to be replaced & beds to be made? This should be standard! We didn't use the bathtub as it was so filthy because it was rarely cleaned. Our sheets weren't changed after one week of use until we called the front desk twice. Definitely the worst aspect of our stay. Front Desk The front desk staff were generally very polite & friendly. Princess is a delight & well suited to her role. The hotel offers a minibus & driver to different destinations on Oahu 6 days a week. This is a great service & well worth the $10. We only experienced one problem. My daughter went to the front desk to book a $10 airport shuttle a few days before departure. However, apparently shuttles don't pick up from Waikiki until 8:30am. One would think the person she spoke to at the front desk would have told her that but no. Instead a taxi arrived, at a much more expensive $29 flat rate (excluding state tax). My daughter wasn't told that this fixed rate is only for cash fares so she had to change taxis & pay far more as she needed to pay with a credit card. This drama all happened simply because she wasn't given the correct information! So frustrating. Overall, we did have an enjoyable stay but the lack of housekeeping & hidden taxes definitely put a dampener on things. For the money, I think I would try another hotel next time. - [ ] ","Sydney, Australia","Gatsbygardenia1968</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",33,3.0

Literally it looks like the room was painted but no preparation done at all under the new paint, the furniture is falling a part, the bottom was falling out of the drawers in the dresser, everything was old and worn out and there was no comfy chair in the room. Also I think this is the only hotel in the world that doesn't have any glassware in it which I guess is ok because the chair on the lanai is not one you'd want to sit on to have a drink in the afternoon anyway.The biggest joke has to be the amenities fee pretty sure this is a practical joke or the biggest example of a lack of attention to detail. Among other things this fee is supposed to cover, hi speed wifi, bottled water in the room, the coffee for the coffee machine and breakfast. The reason I have mentioned these is because these are where the most attention to detail is lacking. Starting with the wifi, high speed maybe compared to dial up and the fact that it drops in and out because of lack of signal strength makes you so happy to have to pay extra for it. Water to the room great but it is not replenished at all during your stay the coffee on the other hand is although again attention to detail- there are two types and I prefer a dark roast so used this one but it was replaced with the mild roast....great job. Now breakfast it would be ok if there was attention to detail... they tend to just let anyone in and there is not enough chairs and tables, I love having my coffee standing up while waiting for a table or being literally pushed out of the way. The food was passable but really not worth the struggle. All this is fantastic in light of an extra amenities fee that is actually compulsory and added to everyone on arrival. I have more examples of the poor attention to detail I encountered but All in all to be 100% honest you can do so much better for the money which is very disappointing because underneath there is some promise.For now my tip look elsewhere.

We were all tired but welcomed by the hotel front desk staff Darwin when we checked in. He was very personable, genuine, and patient to me and my family. He explained all the amenities the hotel had to offer. I was very impressed with room. It was clean, very comfortable, and spacious with double- queen beds. We loved the vintage-style appearance of the hotel. It has some history about it too hanging on a plaque inside the lobby. What was cool about the room we had, is that it had a kitchen and a balcony. The balcony was nice to relax and kick back at watching the coconut trees sway in the wind and watching the sunrises and sunsets. The A/C was a split unit therefore it was so quiet, you couldn't hear it. The breakfast buffet was phenomenal. The tasty eggs were real and not powdered, bacon crispy, passion fruit orange juice chilled, and they even had miso soup which was authentic Japanese-tasting. The breakfast staff was quite helpful in getting our family settled at a table which fills up quick. I think it's because the breakfast buffet was quite tasty and affordable. Our breakfast buffet was included with our stay. The hotel was in a perfect location. Stores, restaurants, and the beach were steps away but it was nestled in a quieter part of Kalakaua Avenue away from the hustle and bustle. There are bus stop in front and also close proximity from the hotel. You can catch the pink-line double decker bus in the front. It does a loop around Waikiki and the end stop is at the Ala Moana Center. So, that was very convenient. There was a nice park across the street. It was nice to cut across the quiet, tree-shaded park with the smell of plumeria in the air and walk 5 minutes to Waikiki Beach. What was awesome is that the hotel would loan you Bahama Beach chairs and beach towels. As for parking, Erik was the valet that helped us the most. He was very friendly, down-to-earth guy, and professional. The valet rates is the best-priced parking in all of Waikiki area. The only thing that needs improvement in the hotel was internet wifi. It couldn't connect. As for the bathroom, that needed updating. Oh her than that, all was gravy. During our last day there, Darwin the front desk staff helped checked us out. He is such a nice gentleman, he gave Hawaiian Host chocolates to each of my 3 children. He truly went above and beyond to make our family feel welcomed and comfortable during our stay there. I stay at a variety of chain hotels for work every week and I was truly impressed with the Waikiki Gateway and others cannot compare when it comes to such a personable-accommodating staff.

The prices seemed to be comparable to the rest of the hotels in the area. In addition, we fell for Breakfast Included deal hoping to save a bit on breakfast (which was not the greatest plus the same menu every single day) as Hawaii eateries tend to be pricey. We arrived late at night and got our room assigned. When we went upstairs and opened the door, we found ourselves walking in on other guests sleeping tight in what we initially believed was our room. Well, that was awkward, creepy and quite comical - something that you would think happens only in movies and sitcoms. Basically, we were assigned a wrong room number (1101 instead of 1011), which we received apologies and a free day of parking for. Speaking of parking and other hotel amenities, valet parking was quite pricey at USD $29/night and resort fee was USD $20/night. So, when you book a hotel room here, make sure to add these costs into your total cost per night. Our actual room was very basic, but clean. Although, as another person mentioned before me, the corridor that leads from the elevator to the rooms is quite smelly (moldy smell on both 11th and 10th floors) and our room had a strong Clorox smell when we walked in. Even though the hotel claims that the rooms have been recently renovated, they still teleport you to 1980s once you walk in. The AC was working well and was very quiet, we didn't have any issues with it. However, what we had a huge inconvenience with is WiFi. The hotel claims to have high speed wifi, which was practically non-existent in our room. We could barely connect to it and whenever we succeeded, it was 1998 speed, only without the fancy modem sound. We asked the front desk to reset it a few times, but that did not help. The only place where we were able to get a decent connection and speedy wifi was the business centre on the third floor. It was very inconvenient for us not to be able to connect to wifi, as we had to do some work and respond to e-mails in the morning before heading out for the day. We were told that they are working on replacing/improving WiFi connection. However, if you book this hotel around the date this review is posted, do not expect having good WiFi in your room. That said, hotel staff provided exceptional service. Everyone was extremely welcoming, nice and helpful. We requested an iron and ironing board to be brought to our room and they sent it within a few minutes. The front desk was very responsive and would call back to check in whether we received the requested items and whether our wifi started working better after they reset it. They were kind enough to lend us a couple of beach towels in our last day after we checked out (which we returned at the end of the day). It seems like the staff is trying to do their very best with what they have. To be fair there were a few other positive sides to the room and the hotel. The bed mattress was very comfy and we slept like babies through the night. The shower head in the bathtub was my favourite feature of the hotel room, cause it provided strong water pressure, with a wide diameter of water flow (yes, I pay attention to that lol). The bathroom was clean, but had a strong Clorox smell for the first day or so. I'd suggest replacing whatever smelly cleaning supplies the hotel is using with something more hypoallergenic and with no scent. Unpleasant smell can be a huge buzz kill, especially when you are on vacation. Another positive feature of the hotel is the central location. It's situated close to the international shopping centre and other trendy shops and eateries (if you are into that). It's also located within a pleasant 15-minute walk to the Waikiki beach. I'm sure there are more places to see and things to do around that area, but we focused more on exploring other corners of the island.In sum, if you are looking for a basic, comparable in price, centrally located hotel, where you are not planning to spent to much time during the day, this is not a bad option to go for. Hopefully, my review was helpful :) Have a great time in Oahu!",,Yana B,3,3.0

My husband and I stayed here for three nights and was very delighted with out time here. We are light sleepers and honeymooners who were flying in from the other side of the world. So we were very glad that the staff and management went over and beyond to accommodate our request for a quiet room. Since we arrived on a weekday on the latter part of spring (not peak season), they were able to upgrade us to a suite with a wraparound balcony and great view of the ocean and the city. They also greeted us with a box of chocolates. But even if they did not upgrade our room, we were happy with this hotel. Hawaii is an expensive city to visit, and Waikiki Gateway is reasonably priced. It's a few minutes walk from the busy waikiki beach, but is located along a convenient road. The bed was comfortable, bathroom is a bit small but very clean. There's coffeemaker in the room too. Also, I will never forget my first step into the room -- it smelled like sweet pineapples! what a great detail that is fittingly hawaiian. The only letdown was the breakfast buffet.

So we had to go all the way to the lobby just so we can book a flight and check emails. Asked the staff about it and they said ""they are working on it"" but it still wasn't working the next day.

We asked to be moved and got a great balcony with proper padded lounge chairs, so evenings relaxing on the balcony were awesome. The staff are great, lovely people. The breakfast is not quite your ""buffet of hot food"" most days its scrambled eggs and some skinless sausage like things, but its fine. Once day we were there, there was bacon - yay! There is a convenience store right on the corner which is great. The tourist buses stop right outside and you are really handy for all the high end shops and great restaurants nearby. The hotel says the wi fi is fast, mine wasnt.

Cockroaches were all over the room: the bathroom, the kitchen (even in the fridge), the walls and floor. I requested the room be sprayed and asked for bug spray (the hotel can not give out big spray and I had to fend off the bugs myself. I recommend BYO bug spray). These requests were not acted on. Finally I emailed a complaint with pictures to the hotel. An exterminator was brought in the day before my check out while I inhabited the room. The morning of check out I had the awful experience (after my shower) of feeling the crunch underfoot of treading on one of the many cockroaches that were dead in the floor.

The three of us could not fault the staff in any way. Friendly, helpful, happy, nothing was too much of a bother from ordering a taxi for us, to setting up two wake-up calls in the morning. Breakfast was okay, but not much of a variety if you are staying a few days.Same fruit every day. Whilst we were having breakfast there were a couple of brooms in the setting-up area in the room. I don't think these brooms should have been there - not a good look whilst you are eating. We were placed on the four in an apparent ""deluxe room"". Judging by other photographs of deluxe rooms on the web, I think we were not given a room that was deluxe. We were all totally disappointed, when we compared with other photographs of previous guests. We were placed in a corner room, which isn't too bad, we had two verandahs to sit on and admire the views. The room needs to be insulated, as being on Floor 4, we heard all of the traffic from early in the morning until about midnight, when either the traffic died down, or we fell asleep. When we first arrived we exited the lift on Floor 4 and all we could smell was paint, as they were renovating. A few of the lights didn't work in the room, along with the kettle (hot pot). Also the shower curtain rod fell down whilst we were there in the bathroom. Overall, it is a fantastic position. Walking distance to the beach, and the main strip of Waikiki, but far enough away so there wasn't any hustle and bustle from foot traffic. The Pink Line bus pulls our right at the front, and it costs $2.00 for a day pass. Well worth it.. The Gateway supplies bottles of water in the room, but only on the first day. They do have a water supply on hand, near the main foyer, if you wish to top your water bottle up each day. Over all, I would call our stay in the Gateway Hotel average. The room was clean, the staff the best I've encountered, but the other negatives that happened whilst we were there to do with the room, I think I would pay a few extra $'s and stay elsewhere if I returned.","Townsville, Australia","Sh F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Townsville, Australia</strong>",5,3.0

But low bandwith due to usage of many guests (especially in the morning and evening). The elevators were not working properly. Not much electricity sockets in the room, and they were hidden. Fridge is noisy. Not eco friendly, you will have to switch off every usage of electricity manually when you leave the room. Swimming pool was closed due to some repaire work. Couldn't find the gym. The shower tap was leaking water resulting in a wet floor after every shower. But ...Stayed here in total 2+5 nights of our 19 days during Hawaii trip. Slept on the 14th floor with 2 balconies. One facing the ocean and other facing the busy main street of Waikiki. The views were amazing and by day it will give much natural light in the room. Hotel located coveniently near many shops, restaurants, beaches and bus stops. A huge television in room was really nice to watch some sport games. Breakfast was tasty. Hotel owned parking.

As soon as we got to the hotel we were greeted with excitement and warmth. We were checked into the Waikiki Gateway by a little Miss Princess K. Tabernero. Princess and her fellow staff members were very accommodating. We were given a map as well as a list of things to do that were recommended by the staff there at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel. If you have never been to the island before and would like to learn how to pronounce a few words go ahead and have the front desk folks help you out, it definitely makes for a good laugh. I was even given a birthday card and some amazing candies...I'm telling you, no joke, this was an amazing experience. The Room was newly renovated, the AC worked great when needed, and we even had a little balcony to ourselves. Whenever we realized we forgot anything, whether it be snacks or beverages, there was a little ABC store connected to the hotel. We were within a few blocks of everything we wanted, Beach, Restaurants, Bars, Shopping, and much more. I really cannot say enough about this place and the next time I stay in the Waikiki Area I will definitely be staying here. I wish I could remember all of the staff members names to thank them all but, I would like to once again say thank you to Princess K. Tabernero and Roger!
