I actively miss this hotel when I’m home. There is an intimacy here, almost like a boutique hotel, that doesn’t conflict with the big-hotel luxury of the place; much of that is the wonderful staff service.And it is luxurious! I particularly like how every room is wonderful; you do not need to book the highest-end rooms, as you do in some hotels, to have access to features like a splendid bathroom in your room, plus the gym and pool. The entire hotel is non-smoking as well.As the hotel rooms are on the upper floors of this high-rise, every view is a gem. The window wall is one of my favorite features, with a long window seat that reminds you there is plenty of pleasure to be had just sitting with a cup of tea and a sweet and cozying up in your room.Even the standard rooms are spacious and immaculate. Small thoughtful treats will greet your arrival in your room. Beds are extremely comfortable, lights and window shades are operated by a bedside iPad. Temperatures are easily regulated. Wi-fi is free and fast. There are plenty of electric sockets. The bathroom has a huge tub and a separate shower; the toilet is tucked away behind its own door (and the toilet lid greets you by opening when you approach). The glass bath wall opaques at a touch. Tons of elegant toiletries including toothbrushes and exfoliating cloths. Robes and slippers provided, amenities such as kettles, coffee maker, refrigerator, iron, and hair dryer are all there for you. The cabinetry gleams with a clean white finish. You will wish you could just decide to live there for the next year.The pool is a large indoor lap pool at a comfortably warm temperature, the locker rooms have their own mini-onsen right there, plus a lounging area with a view. It, too, is utterly immaculate and stocked with luxe amenities.It is located in a building with a mall on the lower floors, including a gourmet grocery, restaurants, flower shop, a Dean and Deluca, etc. The stores even keep late hours.The Prince Gallery is located between two subway stations (Akasaka-Mitsuke and Nagata-Cho) on different lines, barely a block away from either. Both stops have easy access to central subway lines/stops. I never needed a taxi with such convenient subway access. Though the area’s reputation is to be surrounded by administrative buildings and such, it has plenty of walkable shopping, restaurants, etc. to its south, and Roppongi Hills just a short distance east, and it is very centrally located in Tokyo. You will not feel isolated!Basically? I would like to marry this hotel. ","Saint Clair Shores, Michigan","Michifille</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Clair Shores, Michigan</strong>",12,5.0

The high tech ToTo toilet only took a few minutes to figure out for a first timer using such technology .... and it did a good job too.The smoking lounge was well appreciated by my wife who did not have to go outside to smoke.

These toilets are far superior to any toilet in North America, why aren’t they commonplace in North America as they are in Japan?The room also had fantastic views of the city and Imperial Palace and has an iPad to control the curtains and lights etc. The pool and bath areas are great (Japanese style naked, separate sections for gents and ladies). The morning breakfast in the Oasis restaurant was awesome, great buffet options and one option from the menu. I also had dinner at Souten. It is a very nice restaurant and I got the Souten meal which was about $200 USD per person, so that is quite pricey, but it was a multi-course mealthat included Wagyu beef, so that probablyaccounts for much of the large price tag. Best part of the hotel is the staff. They are incredibly friendly and helpful. They even arranged to courier a tote bag we had mistakenly left at our last hotel in Hakuba (3-4 hours away) and it arrived in less than 24 hours.

My office is in the Maronouchi area and I tend to stay close to the office however the Prince Gallery was just a short trip away. My first impressions of the hotel were “wow”! The view from the room was simply spectacular and my partner and I never tired of sitting in the comfortable cushioned window box and looking out at the open view. We also sampled the hotel restaurants and bars which were absolutely top quality and shared spectacular views with a funky modern design to provide a very modern take on the Japanese business/leisure hotel. Unfortunately my stay was cut short by Typhoon Hagibis. I must commend the staff highly for keeping myself and my business colleague informed of the situation. Trains and the limousine bus to Narita had ceased running, but a small window opened up on Friday evening for Saturday transportation to Narita on the limousine bus. The concierge desk rang late Friday night (we had asked to be notified if the situation changed) and secured us tickets on the Narita Limousine Bus that only operated a few services on Saturday morning and allowed us to depart the hotel at 7am and make the last flight out of Narita and back home to Singapore at midday before the airport and all transport systems in Tokyo shut down. The client-centric approach and organization this would have taken given the large number of guests facing disruption from the Typhoon was a credit to the staff that managed this seamlessly and smoothly. I highly recommend this Hotel for either the business or leisure traveller to Tokyo.

Prince Gallery is right next to a subway station where four lines intersect. This was extremely convenient as we were traveling with our young son. Also, there is a convenience store, deli, restaurants in the building and lots of restaurants nearby down the street. Ritz Carlton is connected to Tokyo mid town which houses lots of shops and restaurants, but subway stations are a ten minute walk. Park Hyatt isn’t close to anything.

As platinum at Marriott, we were upgraded to a corner view room on our last day at Prince Gallery.

The view from the room is also breathtaking. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud. The gym has pretty much everything you need to get a decent workout on the road. In addition to the cardio, there's a pull down machine, two dumbbell sets, a guided bench press/squat machine, and a cable crossover machine. When using the pool, understand that they have strict rules for it since it's not chlorinated. You need to wear a shower cap and shower before you get in. Also, if you have tattoos, you might have to cover it or will be denied entry. That being said, the pool and the locker rooms are very clean and impressive. I would recommend sitting in the hot tub with the view of the city.The club room on the 34th floor was also very nice. It's not 24 hours, so please keep that in mind. The Hors d'Oeuvres were all high quality, especially during happy hour. If you go any other time, there's still beer and sake available. I also think there's other drinks the staff can make, although I didn't ask. Obviously you're going to pay to stay here.

To provide some perspective, my next favorite is the Shangrila Singapore Valley Wing. Room. Both times we have stayed with my family of four (2 teenage kids) and taken the corner suite with adjoining room for the kids. The suite has a 270 view of Tokyo and is just spectacular. Sitting in the window seat enjoying a morning Nespresso (they have my favorite flavor in the room) watching the city come alive never gets old. The layout of the sitting area next to the bedroom allows for a perfect spot for us all to comfortably sit in between jaunts across the city. If you want to sleep in, the automatic shades (two: sheer and blackout) work wonders and add a modern touch to the traditional deep-wood furniture.Having said all, this can’t say enough about the bathrooms. On the amenities, it’s one of the few times I have ended up purchasing the brand being used. The towels and robes are amazing but (and I’m by no means an exhibitionist) taking a rain shower or sitting in the deep bathtub with a floor to ceiling view of the city is something everyone should experience.I should also note the bathroom in the adjoining room has glass walls that turn opaque when someone is using it. I have to admit we played with that for at least 5 minutes when we first walked in!Hotel. The other parts of the hotel we used are the guest lounge and breakfast, which for us became an integral part of the day. Neither of my teenager kids are big morning people (even less so with jetlag) but every morning we all made our way to the top floor to take in the morning views and beautiful array of foods. We’re just a basic eggs & bacon family but ending up eating pastries, fruits, pastas, the most perfect poached eggs and so much more. In the afternoons and evenings, we would come back to the lounge for a snack or evening drink. With daily changing changing hors d’ouevres and a light selection of wine, beer, liquors (I was never found wanting), it was great because after having been through the onslaught of food choices in Tokyo, just walking up and grabbing what was there was a relaxing way to get a snack.Only on my second stay did I discover another hidden gem: the fitness center and spa. You absolutely have to take advantage of the sauna and hot/cold baths. I only did it in the evening but relaxing in the hot bath looking at the night sky over a sprawling city was magical.Finally, the staff are just incredible. If you’ve never experienced it, Japanese service is really at it’s own level. In particular, Mr. Zentaro Usami is incredibly helpful and took great care of my family.Hope this helps!",,geraldsee,0,5.0

We couldn't get over the view at night OR in the morning. The room was a really good size even by our Western standards, and the bed was comfortable. The glassed-in bathroom allowed for a bath with an amazing nighttime view, and you can also frost the glass for privacy. We had breakfast in the club lounge, and the food was pretty nondescript, but the place was very quiet and relaxing, again with a pretty view. I only wish we had stayed longer. When we come back to Tokyo we will absolutely be staying in this hotel. We stayed in some nice hotels this trip including a beautiful ryokan, but this was my favorite. It was easily worth the price for us. ","Phoenix, Arizona","b0uffant</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",6,5.0

Everyone had their bags searched and were asked to walk through security guard with detectors. Even if you had only just walked out and they could see your room card, they would force you to stop and actually ask you to open up your handbag. Then to make matters worse you could only use certain elevators and the staff had the audacity to say ""Excuse me, step aside, important person coming"". You would be made to stand still and wait. Then some embassy staff and embassy security staff would walked passed."". You would be told ""Ok thank you, you can proceed now, but you need to only use this elevator"". This went on for our stay and we found it shameful and all the hotel had to do was email us and say they are having some embassy staff stay at the hotel, and because these people think they are important and deserve special treatment, you will be subjected to having your hand bag searched, and you will need to go through security men every single time you walk in and out of the hotel. This is not a holiday. This is an accurate and detailed evaluation of the rest of the hotel, and we are able to supply dates and name and room number.Club Floor:The staff are lazy. You actually have to ask them ""Is this table ok to sit at, it looks like there is no one here, but there are dirty plates and glasses and we have been standing around and wondering if we can sit here"". They are so lazy, they just seem to be at the front desk on the computer but there are no guests there. Next, they do not replenish the canapes etc after 6.15pm even though they are open until 7pm and we found it was so stingy and a lack of canapes etc that we have paid for in the higher room rate. We also noticed that the security staff and staff of the embassy were using the Club Floor and they were on their mobiles and looking at everyone, it was very uncomfortable. We don't feel they should have been allowed in there because the Ambassador wasn't in there. The Rooms:The Security Men stood on all the floors and starring at any guest who came out of the lift and there were security men standing in the corridors. It was really uncomfortable and not right that management of this hotel out of sheer greed didn't tell us up front about this intrusion. If you want to have Ambassadors and staff in your hotel and basically turn the hotel into an airport, even worse actually than the airport because at least at the airport people don't stop you and say ""Please stop, important person is going to be walking by"". What an absolute joke that these people actually think they are important. We thought the Prime Minister must have been there and even if he was and he wasn't, the hotel has an obligation to advise guests who are on a holiday this is what is going to happen and if you don't feel comfortable, then you can have the opportunity to choose another hotel. The Bathrooms:The bathrooms are dysfunctional. There is ONE small sink and hardly any vanity space. And when you stand at the ONE small sink which is low, your legs are pressing into a metal rail for a towel. The lack of vanity space is terrible and this was in their Executive Club Room, so it would be the same for the other rooms. We spoke to some other people and they commented on the one sink with hardly any vanity room. Next, the toilet is close to the sink and the toilet detects you near the sink and the lid goes up etc as if you are going to walk in and use the toilet. The shower is a joke. If you are in the shower and someone wants to use the bathtub, they have to walk through your water because the bath and shower are in the same large area with no separation and all the tiles around the bath are wet from the shower. The Bed:The bed was very comfortable and clean.The TV:The only TV in the world where we couldn't get it to be in English and we had to ring up Reception twice.The Reception Staff:The lady who checked us in spoke English but didn't really understand English. She was shocking and was giggling and had no idea what we were asking. When we asked her if we could speak to someone who spoke English she just giggled again. The Concierge:Really obvious she dislikes her job. Unfriendly, and it was like we were a nuisance to ask about things and of course while we were at her desk ""Excuse me, please stand aside....Important person coming, please stand still, thank you thank you"" Some lady probably one of the wives comes walking through with her staff. Then, other guests were told ""Only use this lift"". The Lifts:If you pay the extra for the club lounge, you have to change lifts. Terrible design and set up.Conclusion:We found the Japanese people in Tokyo so well mannered and lovely except here in this hotel. They had no regard for the huge amount of money we paid to stay at the hotel, which was worse than staying at the airport. The staff in the club lounge are just down right lazy. One staff member said No English and went and got a man. Food was terrible. Waste of money. Small too. The management are devious not telling paying guests about the embassy staff staying at the hotel and the interrogation and having to stand aside and having to open up your hand bag. If these people are important to you, then sacrifice your other rooms for innocent people like us paying full freight money for the rip off club floor rooms and the lazy staff who are in the club floor.You really are a shame to such a beautiful city. You bring down the integrity of your brand. Honesty is always the best policy. Be up front and tell full paying guests about the interruptions next time, and let the guests decide if they want this type of holiday.",Australia,"TarakayAustralia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",228,2.0

However I believe hospitality is the service you provide and this hotel a lot of training to do. They are nowhere close to RC Kyoto. Club Lounge staff are nice however they need to walk around more and tidy and pick up empty glasses napkins etc. from previous guests. Food there is not worth it. I don’t understand why a hotel in Tokyo serve makers mark but no Japanese whisky! Concierge seems afraid to recommend a restaurant they just count the names something I can do on my phone. Check in process was not very welcoming or informative. Overall staff is not very friendly or genuine. Interactions seem little robotic unfortunately. I don’t even want to get into using the pool which we were allowed two hours after we went there when we were getting ready to go to dinner. Comical!

First off, it's very easy to get to. We opted to take the Narita Express from the airport directly to Tokyo Station. From there get on the Marunouchi Line towards Ogikubo and hop off at M13, Akasaka-mitsuke station. The Prince Gallery can be easily seen after exiting onto the street. Another alternative is the Friendly Airport Limousine which offers bus service directly to the hotel. We were sold on the rooms prior to our trip by going on youtube and watching videos from people who have stayed there. Our room was not worn or distressed from previous use. We loved the huge window that looked out towards Tokyo Skytree. We'd spend many nights on the padded bench against the window just talking and soaking it all in. The décor is beautiful and the room was very well laid out. There were useful amenities like an ironing board/iron that we utilized as well. One big thing that we discovered later during our stay was the conbini on the second floor of the building. Japanese convenience stores are a step up from what we have in the States in terms of fresh food offerings. We ended up eating at conbinis several times during our vacation and it was like striking gold when we found out there was one in the same building. During our first night at the hotel we were hungry and spent almost $75 on room service. You can spend a fraction of that at the conbini downstairs.Speaking of food, the Oasis Garden does have a legit breakfast offering. You can choose from the buffet plus one item from a set menu or a traditional Japanese breakfast sans the buffet. At around $40 per person it's a tad pricey. If you book a room with breakfast included I calculated the savings to be around $10 per person versus paying for it separately. Despite the price, we enjoyed it so much that we came back every morning during our stay to fuel up for all the walking that was to come. The views from the dining area aren't too shabby either. Some random notes. The hotel smells amazing. Certain public areas have the most amazing scent. It was lovely returning to the hotel and smelling this as you walked around. The service was impeccable too. Although many people recommend staying in Shinjuku or Shibuya we really enjoyed this area of Tokyo since it felt like we were returning to someplace quiet. It was also nicely positioned between the areas of the city that we wanted to explore. We definitely plan on staying here again for future trips.","Chicago, Illinois","To0ps</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",37,5.0

The hotel is absolutely beautiful and the service was wonderful. I can’t imagine that there is a room that doesn’t have an amazing view of the Tokyo skyline. We stayed in the standard deluxe room with a king bed. However, this bed was significantly larger than a king bed- I think it was actually two full beds put together. It. Was. Amazing. The floor to curling windows have electric shades you can operate from an iPad- which means you can make it completely black out dark in your room. We slept like babies for the entire weekend!All of the amenities in the room were top notch. The bath and shower was simply amazing. Housekeeping was friendly.The hotel sushi bar was excellent, and no need for reservations. We also enjoyed the hotel bar, which has an excellent cocktail menu and killer view.As stated, the hotel is in a mixed use development- so there is a Dean & Deluca, Starbucks, supermarket, convenience store, and numerous restaurants within an elevator ride. You are also a 3 minute walk to two metro stops, so you basically have all the good metro lines within easy access (Ginza, Marunouchi, Hanzomon, Nambouku lines).The only thing that hotel could improve on was the arrival. When we arrived at the Porte-cochere in our taxi, we were escorted inside and told our room wasn’t ready. So they asked us to take a seat in the entry area- which is very modern, Japanese-minimalist style. There were quite a few people waiting in this area. What we didn’t realize at the time is that this wasn’t the lobby. We sat in this area for about 20-30 minutes- it was slightly warm since the doors are constantly opening and closing and they didn’t offer any water while we waited. If we had just rolled off a long international flight, I might have been more irritated about this scenario.Eventually, we were told our room was ready and we were escorted to the elevator and the actual lobby on the 36th floor for check in.

The hotel is mainly on the upper 10 or so floors. This means the lift configuration is a bit odd as you have to change lifts to get from the reception area to the room floors. No biggie. The view from every floor is spectacular! We were facing the Imperial Gardens and Tokyo Skytree and it was fantastic. The bar on the 35th floor also had a stellar view of Tokyo Tower and some amazing drinks. One of us fell in love with the mixed berry mojito! One of the best things about the hotel though is the location just opposite a metro station. This was how we got around the whole city and it was amazingly convenient to have 5 different lines to choose from. The hotel was also very sweet and left us some nice goodies when we arrived as we were celebrating our first anniversary! Always a nice touch to go above and beyond! The bathroom was also a shining star. The array of available toiletries was incomparable! The Toto smart toilet raised and lowered its own lid when you entered or exited the toilet space. The glass walls surrounding the bath/shower area could go opaque if you wanted extra privacy.

The hotel itself is located at the top of a tall skyscraper in the Chiyoda district of Tokyo which offered us amazing 180 degree view of surrounding Tokyo. It is located literally right next to the Asakasa-Mitsuke station which allows for easy access to 2 Tokyo Metro lines and thus easy access to the main tourist sites. We arrived here from Narita Airport to the metro station. The room itself was immaculate with a spacious bathroom which we loved the separate bathtub/shower head space. There was evening turn down service which was very much appreciated We were able to enjoy the breakfast buffet at the Oasis restaurant which has both Western offerings as well as Japanese breakfast option. Thought the variety of food offered was slightly less compared to similar luxury hotels throughout Asia. Overall, we loved our stay at the hotel and would stay again on our next visit to Tokyo.

The breakfast service is fantastic and the staff are helpful, polite and attentive without being over bearing. The hotel benefits from a stunning bar area which looks over Shinjuku and has a three storey floor to ceiling glass window. It is futuristic and stylish/modern and worth a visit in of itself.The hotel is located on the 34-36th floors of a modern glass building, and is based over a high-end shopping centre with many great Resteraunts. It also has dedicated underground /metro access which is convenient for Akihabara and Shinjuku. It also has the best smoking lounge in Tokyo (if you need one) .Each room has an iPad which controls the temperature, curtains, windows and room service/cleaning services. The iPad is really useful because it comes in several languages (although the staff speak impeccable English with many who speak Mandarin and Korean. The beds are very comfortable. Although the rooms are a bit smaller than comparable hotels (like the Peninsula) they are laid out in such a way that they feel larger and more spacious. I think the rooms are all standard sized across the hotel (except the very high end suites) and have stunning views with large windows and bay window seating area.

The bathroom also huge, I still remember spending me time at the bathtub and just enjoy Tokyo scenery. New USB port beside the bed? or I forgot that it was there last year, only remember they provide charger and cable.Given exception to enjoy the lounge by concierge team, thank you for this nice gesture and recommend me to book club room (which I never did). Lounge much less crowded from past stay, it's still gorgeous, with polite and attentive staff, and in my opinion with tastier hors d'oeuvre, I can understand why some hi tier member gets frustrating, not able to enjoy complimentary lounge access.Breakfast is almost the same, I can't understand why some reviewers don't like the BF, it is one of the best that I ever tried, with so many variations to choose, and the main selling is the VIEW. The choice still the same, western / buffet / beautiful Japanese BF presentation. Tried the swimming pool this time, just want to enjoy the scenery. This hotel also has a good looking and comfortable smoking room just beside the business room, A little suggestion time limitation for using the computer extended to 2 hours, sometimes 1 hour is not enough to do the works, have to start all over again opening this and that.While checking out, have quite a long line, and a bit messy, due to a small misunderstanding. but it was handled gracefully. Again, the Bell Desk team very helpful with our luggage.Overall it is an excellent experience again, will give this hotel 5 star anytime.

Rooms are very well thought out and quiet, and the bed extremely comfortable. Front desk service was fine, as was the bar, but the overall ambience was of a 3 or 4 star business hotel, albeit a brand new one. The breakfast was disappointing; weak breads, perfunctory fruit selection and meagre salads, reminiscent of a domestic-focused regional Japan offering. Japan's labor shortage, especially in hospitality, really showing up in the youth and inexperience of some of the floor staff. And the music throughout? Bizarre and detracting from the ambience rather than adding to it. C&W and American pops in the Japanese baths; random trance influences in the bar and a bit of everything, all of it too loud, in the all-day restaurant. Conclusion: If you can cocoon yourself in the room this is probably a worthwhile destination, but if you want an all round lux hotel experience, you can do much better in Tokyo.","Tokyo, Japan","EJL2720</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",17,4.0

It was nice to have access to the lounge for afternoon tea and for drinks, but the evening appetizers were only OK. There was no hot food, which was really surprising, and the same food was served each evening. This was a disappointment. Marriott Bonvoy members still get breakfast in the restaurant, and the buffet was great -- lots of variety of both western and Asian foods. If I don't have access to the lounge next time, I would still choose to stay here. This property really is that nice.Thank you for a most amazing experience.

However it seems that nothing has changed so far. Hotel decided to take away some benefits granted previously to Platinum members – access to Lounge and possibility to have Japanese breakfast at no charge. I know that it is not usual for a Luxury Collection brand to have Lounge and provide access to Platinum guests, but there is nothing preventing hotel from continuing with the previous policy. I can partially understand that Lounge is at full capacity at times (it was not when I visited the hotel), but I don’t see any rational why not to offer Platinum members the Japanese breakfast at no charge.

The hotel is also connected to the metro station so it is also convenient.We check in at around 3 and immediately get the room. We book through Amex FHR with Marriott Titanium status, however, no upgrade in terms of room size is offered due to high occupancy, we get upgraded to a room with a better view (tokyo tower view). The front desk lady is not aware that we book via Amex FHR which include breakfast until being told. She ask if I would like to get breakfast, welcome gift or Marriott points as welcome amenity and I clarify that I should have include breakfast and finally she realize that, however, no further AMEX benefit is mentioned until I also question about the $100 USD hotel credit. Anyway I do think this is only some minor problem as the lady is very sincere and polite I which I feel very comfortable for the check in process. Finally I choose the welcome gift - a traditional design Japanese chopstick as the elite welcome gift.We are escorted to the room by the agent. She briefly introduced the room function. The hotel is very hi-tech with key is needed to access to elevator or gym/swimming pool. Ipad control panel is used for all functions in the room. The room is with a big bay window sofa so you can lie down relaxingly to enjoy the view with a drink. The hotel is very new so the hardware is unbeatable. As titanium member we suppose to get access to executive lounge, however, as told by the front desk agent, after the merger to Marriott Bonvoy program, elite members are no longer eligible to go into the lounge, but they said the give concession this time for us because of our loyalty. I do think it is not a good act towards the member but I understand as they suppose to be a top tier brand like ritz carlton. To be honest, it is not a loss even you cannot go into the lounge. There is nothing impressive despite the drink selection (I dont drink alcohol much). The liquor is basic selection without something premium. Food variety is also poor. No hot food is available. During the evening cocktail, there are only 3 kinds of cold appetizers and some Japanese rice crackers. We left the lounge for dinner.The hotel is close to the Akasaka which has lots of restaurants and convenient stores. Bed is soft and comfortable. We have a very good sleep. For the AMEX $100 USD credit it equals to around 10000 yen (actually it should be more but it is fine). We order room service for a premium sushi set as supper to use it up as we have breakfast include and we have dinner outside.The following morning we have breakfast in the all-day dining restaurant. For Marriott member who choose breakfast as the amenity, they only include the buffet breakfast. If you prefer Japanese set or american breakfast, 1000 yen additional is required. We choose the Japanese breakfast which is really really nice and beautiful! highly recommend!!We finally check out at 3pm although we request late check out until 4pm. We have a very lovely stay here and I will definitely return in the future! (I will give 4.5 instead of 4 but tripadvisor doenst have such rating) I will give 5 if more AMEX FHR benefits are really applied.

I now have to pay for a special club floor room in order to gain access. This is absolutely absurd. The club lounge is one of the key reasons I choose to stay at The Prince Gallery, and is one of the key benefits of elite membership across the SPG/Marriott portfolio.I don’t think I will stay at the Prince Gallery again, now that these key benefits have been revoked. Reading through the other reviews, it sounds like several other elites are also choosing to stay at other properties as a result of the change.

English level was reasonably well.- Buffet breakfast at the restaurant was mediocre and the restaurant is often busy but Japanese breakfast is excellent.- Club lounge offering was nice and offers a good, quieter alternative for having breakfasts.- Although not located exactly in the popular tourist areas, many major tourist spots in Tokyo are at an acceptable distance by metro which is easily accessible from the hotel.After my first stay a couple of years ago I was so satisfied with the hotel that it became my ""go-to"" hotel in Tokyo, despite the rather high prices it charges given its location. Now I have second thoughts after learning that the hotel has made significant cutbacks to Marriott Bonvoy elite benefits without prior announcements, including club lounge access and the so-called ""special"" breakfast menus for elites which mean extra charges for an omelette or a Japanese breakfast.Explanation given by the hotel on other recent reviews regarding lounge access is ridiculous as if they were forced by corporate to remove such benefit. It was clearly a cost-cutting move. As for breakfast, I would accept it if non-elite guests booking breakfast-inclusive rates were required the pay the surcharge for a Japanese breakfast, but it appears not to be the case. The concept of this ""special"" menu to elites is simply insulting to loyal guests like myself - I cannot understand why a high-end Japanese hotel would charge loyal guests only for sampling Japanese food.Luckily I learnt such changes before I book my next stay in Tokyo, and I feel sorry for those elite members who book the hotel without knowing such changes.To be honest, without such extra benefits for elites, the hotel does not quite worth the price it has been charging, especially that I could be (and had been) assigned to standard rooms with only 35sqm. With no lounge access, long queues at breakfast restaurant and a ""special"" breakfast menu, there is no point to spend that money to stay here.It was the extra mile the hotel used to go to for elite members which made me return again and again. With the hotel not recognizing loyalty by offering the bare minimum, I can no longer convince myself to keep staying at this hotel anymore. This is a point which the hotel management who proposed (and poorly executed) such changes seems to miss (or not to bother). While this review from a once-loyal guest is unlikely to change anything, I would urge other fellow Marriott elite members to re-consider whether they should stay at a hotel which does not recognize loyalty other than shamelessly repeating that they still offer the bare minimum.","Hong Kong, China","exe_ck</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",39,2.0

I'm Marriott loyal but usually stay at the Grand or Park Hyatts in Tokyo. Though the views from the bar and room are excellent, it went downhill quickly upon check in for my 1 night stay. After walking in to a crowded lobby, we stood in line for about 10 minutes. Then my passport was taken and it was another 20 minutes of sitting. During this time, I noticed my passport, open, on a clipboard of a receptionist running around the lobby. Once they finally got to me, my Platinum status was barely recognized, except to have me choose between breakfast or extra points. I chose breakfast (imporant for later). I was sent on my way to my quite small room on the same floor as the lobby. Room: The room is ultra modern, to a fault. Shower in the middle of the room with button that ""frosts"" the glass is cool if staying alone or with a partner. Ipad controls everything. It was missing any kind of Japanese touch that I've had in other luxury hotels. Size was also smaller than other Tokyo hotels I've stayed. Lounge: **NOTICE TO MARRIOTT STATUS MEMBERS** Lounge access is no longer granted, something that started the day before we arrived. We were ""grandfathered"" in and granted lounge access, though this turned out to be nothing special. From 5-7 they serve drinks, though its limited. No hot food options, and a limited selection of canapes. In addition to the lounge attendant being almost dismissive, they were out of everything. We had to ask for forks, then glasses, then water. It was disappointing. Breakfast: The breakfast incident is what ultimately drops the hotel from 3 to 2. I asked 3 different people in the morning where to have platinum breakfast. All of them said the all day dining restaurant. At 9:30 I waited for 20 minutes to be seated with my 3 friends. The 4 of us then waited another 15 minutes for a server. I asked the server again to confirm, this was the restaurant to have platinum breakfast. She radioed to the host, who said I was not platinum and did not have included breakfast. I produed the Marriott app that showed my status, and she persisted I don't have breakfast included. At this point I started to get mad, and she indicated a front desk agent would come to speak with me. Once the agent arrived, he explained something to the effect that I, despite having the same status as my friends, did not have breakfast, though everyone else did. I pushed. He indicated I must have been told incorrectly at check in, though my friends were told the same thing, and again, had breakfast included with the same status. They ultimately somehow realized their mistake and included breakfast, but this was another 20 min of waiting. We're at nearly an hour now, without any coffee or food. The breakfast buffet includes an egg dish ordered of the menu, mine came cold, one of my friends never came. The buffet was missing many items and not restocked as we were running to the end of breakfast (after waiting an hour). All told, it took more than 90 minutes to have a really subpar breakfast, and I had to head to the airport shortly after. I checked out shortly after, was not asked how the stay was, how I liked anything, just given a bill. A taxi was called, and I was glad to be leaving. In my opinion hotels in Japan live and die on their service. The Prince Gallery missed the mark here, and I'll be returning to a Hyatt next time I'm in Tokyo.

After check in the reception staff ) will take you to your room and introduce the high tech accessories and the room. The curtain and lighting can be controoled with an iPad, and I love that their shower amenities which are made by Byredo. Miss Chiang is the staff who serviced us, and she is very professional and friendly. Maybe because the hotel is located close to the prime minister's residence, the security is very strict, you have to swipe your room key twice before accessing to the guest rooms. As a Marriott PPE member (now titanium status), we were able to access the club lounge and enjoyed complimentary breakfast at the Souten restaurant (other options are Oasis restaurant and the club lounge). The Japanese style breakfast at Souten restaurant was one of the best I have ever had in any hotels. Let's talk about the club lounge. It was a little bit crowded at the happy hour in the lounge, and they arranged us to be seated in the gallery suite close to the club lounge. The suite has a spectacular view of the Imperial Palace to the Skytree. We had a great talk with Mr. Usami, the lounge manager. Mr. Usami was very attentive to bring us food and drink since we were not in the lounge but in the suite room as a temporary lounge space. The stay in Prince Gallery Kioi is like too good to be true, I was hesitating writing the review because I was worried that I cannot get a room here next time. Thanks to all the staff serviced us during our stay so that we had such a great experience.",,whsu2241,1,5.0

The prince park tower club lounge was far superior. The club lounge is more exclusive at the prince park tower. It seemed this lounge was full of businessman using a spg upgrade to get to the club level instead of paying the 500 to 700 dollars a night to get club level at the prince park tower. As a result the quality of food and liquor was inferior. The major upside was that the club lounge staff spoke excellent english and were very helpful. There were things i liked about the hotel such as the views and the quality of rooms and proximity to a subway station. The breakfast was horrible and service horrible. If you want excellent service and a great breakfast stay at the prince park tower but dont expect any kind of upgrade. They dont care how many nights you stay or have stayed.

My review below is using my recent Ritz Carlton Kyoto and St Regis Osaka stay as the benchmark. Facility: The hotel facility is just as beautiful and new as I remembered when they first opened back in 2016. The design of the hotel is simple and elegant. Unlike most hotels where you notice tear and wear even after a few years, this hotel is very well maintained. Everything is iPad controlled. The hotel lobby and bar has an amazing view of the Tokyo tower. For whisky lovers, the bar has a solid selection of Japanese whisky, prices are in alignment to other upscale hotels. Rooms: the room is spacious based on Tokyo standard. Everything is controlled via iPad similar to most hotels. The only challenge I have is that this hotel doesn’t appear to accept suite upgrade certificates, I spoke to a Marriott representative and this has more to do with the fact these are luxury collections. Hopefully with the new loyalty program, this gets sorted out. Location: this hotel has two popular subway station right across the street from the hotel. I opted to stay here because of its central and in the middle of where I wanted to go. There is tons of restaurants in the alley behind the BIC camera which is less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel. We arrived here at close to mid-night and after dropping off our luggage, we went to eat. Lots of good Izakaya, ramen and gyoza options that are open late.Service: the hotel goes beyond and above to help their guests. For example, I needed to purchase foam to package the Japanese whisky I bought in Tokyo. Miss. Tanaka from the front desk provided me the store address (taking into consideration where I was planning to go to make this detour convenient), but in addition to that, she located the floor where the product would likely be stored. And wrote in a note for me in Japanese the name of the product so that I can show the store employees what it is I am looking for in case I can’t find it myself. Another example, the concierge team was able to secure tickets to the Ghibli Museum for me. These tickets are super popular and sell out quickly. Mind you, I made the same request to get tix using the Amex platinum concierge service and they were not able to fulfill it. When I went to thank the concierge team, I found out that a member of the team had to line up at Lawson and purchase them in person right after the tickets were available for sale. Lastly, I had many packages shipped to the hotel and the hotel lobby staff coordinated directly with me via email to ensure my packages arrived safely and stored properly until my arrival. Club lounge: as a platinum member, you will have access to the lounge. The lounge is fully stocked with lots of variety of drinks (soda, juice, tea, Perrier, Evian etc). There is also afternoon tea, during my previous visit we took advantage of this as my 3 year old daughter loved going there for afternoon tea and treats. You will not be disappointed with the lounge options here. Also, a must is to try the Japanese style breakfast. Lastly, to me what really distinguish a hotel’s service is the staff. The staff here is friendly, and if you make an effort to talk to them. They will always remember you and greet you by your name, which is something I always appreciate as they interact with hundreds of guests daily. ",,abby h,6,5.0

The hotel is typical of many in Tokyo: its in a high-rise whose reception area starts somewhere higher up in the high rise (in this case it was the 32nd or 34th floor). You can be guaranteed a view and daylight ), which is why I imagine they have the hotels start at a higher floor so the guest room views aren't blocked. I lucked out and could see into to Mount Fuji on the clear days.2. The service experience and the design is unparalleled:a) At check-in , the staff guides you and escorts you to the roomb) There were always adequate staff in the reception area exuding positive energy as you walked by. There was never a line for check-in or checkout. It seemed they knew how many people to staff at the desks when to get the desired effect.c) On the ground floor, there were sufficient staff members to help you as you got out of a cab, or help you get a cab. I always counted a minimum of 3.3. Health-club and pool facilities were spacious and large. I used the pool twice in the evening, and the health club every day in the morning. I could not sleep past 5am so workout seem to be a good idea to get the day underway. Even at the expected 'peak' time for 6:30am to 8am, they had sufficient equipment that there was never a wait. There was also a full benchpress in addition to the usual hotel equipment you would find. 4. This hotel pays a lot of attention to detail. Here are two examples:a) The safe had an electric outlet in case you wanted to charge your device while out of the roomb) The staff provided (by default) a set of power chargers in the desk to charge the most common devices. I didn't bother to open the bag, but I am convinced that if I had forgotten or lost my adapters, this would have been invaluable.5. Because of work commitments, I didn't get a chance to have a dinner here. But I did order in-room dining a number of times for breakfast. They were efficient and had light meals like smoothie or fruit6. The most important thing was after a long day was to just come unwind in the lobby area (which was half-way up the building height) and just relax, check e-mail in the open setting, and see the night time skylights from the 30+ floor.Highly recommended.",,Frank J,43,5.0

Definitely worth the upgrade. Suites are the largest I’ve stayed at in Tokyo. One of my favorites in Tokyo. Hotel comparisons: Park Hyatt - farther from subway, but equally luxurious and large suites. Andaz - similarly convenient location, suites are smaller. Hyatt Centric - awesome central Ginza location, smallest room and suite. Location: hotel is in Akasaka area of Tokyo, with lots of restaurants and shops within a short walk. Subway station is also convenient. Close to imperial palace. Main Entrance is a bit odd, cars drive through the garage (recessed from street) and pedestrian can walk out through the 4th floor, back side of entrance since hotel is on a slope.The subway is 3-5 mins walk through underground path and we took it to Shinjuku, Shibuya and Odaiba on different days. Super convenient. There’s a food court downstairs and a mini supermarket, very convenient. The location is just outside the main drag of food and bars, so it’s a lovely quiet location by the river. Lobby/rooms: at the top of the high rise building like many a Japan hotels. Modern and spacious. Service: hotel concierge emailed prior to my arrival to inquire about transportation needs and any other bookings they can help us with. Also a month prior, concierge assisted us in making dinner reservations at top restaurants in Tokyo.Club lounge: hotel has a club lounge on the 34th floor for premium guests. You can get platinum breakfast there or in the main restaurant. Suite: we were in a corner suite, same floor as the lobby. It’s the size of a NYC apt! The bedroom has a huge king bed, wrap around corner view of the city and window seat, desk area and a large sofa sitting around. A wall of closet. The suite has another room with the main living room and dining room (dining table seats 6-8 people). Decor is minimalist but warm.Bathrooms: there’s a powder room in the front hall, and a full bathroom attached to the bedroom. Huge space with double sinks, another wall of closets and a enormous modern Ofuro bathroom with bench inside. Separate toilet closet. Remede products were fabulous.If you’re unfamiliar with Ofuro bathroom, it’s basically a large fully enclosed room with a side by side shower and separate soaking tub. You shower and clean up with the shower, then when clean, enjoy a soak in the tub to relax and maybe sit on the bench to enjoy some steam. This would be same procedure if you visit an onsen (except it’s a large public tub).Breakfast buffet: mostly western style food with a lot of selections and includes made to order eggs, truffle omelet was decadent.We had a fabulous stay and would choose to stay here again next time we’re in Tokyo.

The front desk staff was welcoming and was able to get us in our rooms earlier than check in time which is always appreciated as a Platinum member. The concierge has nothing but amazing recommendations, pointing us to amazing restaurants from Sushi to Soba to street food. Great knowledge of the whole city kept us going all week. Like some other reviews, the whole no tattoo policy was inconvenient and seemingly dated (I understand the cultural reasons and precautions but still other Tokyo hotels of the same caliber don’t) and hard to abide by when they cover your ribs. The staff was nice though. The bar at the hotel is a beautiful overlook into the city and is a grandiose feature of design. The lobby restaurant had one of the largest breakfast buffets I’ve seen and this was not your getting cold type of food. Everything was fresh and being replaced continuously. The staff was attentive and serving your every need. It was also a plus the ground level had some venues for a quick bite or refreshment if you wanted to grab something on your way out. After check in our frustration with the front desk grew over the week due to seemingly forever wait times as there were a high volume of guests requiring assistance and a lot of VIPs that took away from the staff count. In the end it just left a bitter taste but its something I’d overlook on a return trip. Overall great time and would definitely return.

The view from the breakfast restaurant is amazing.The only big downside, that in part ruined my experience, was the visit at the Spa/pool, there is a no tattoo rule so the staff provided some stickers to put on the tattos but it was a real putt off, first of all the stickers would be ok for small tattoos if someone has an arm, leg or a bigger tattoo it's a problem,then if someone has hairs on his body the stickers would not attach good and I don't tell you when you have to wash it off...it's not easy and a little painfull. The pool staff was professional and apologised for my big disappointment since my partner did not had the chance to have a bath and I had to fight to put the stickers off my arm.I really understand the tattoo rule but not in a 5* hotel that caters international clients (whom are surerely not a Jakuza member), and since I can't go to the pool with visible tattoos why can I be allowed to walk around the hotel?...it does not make much sense. I've had this tattoo issue only at The Prince Gallery, in the other hotels visited in Tokyo (Conrad, Shangrila) I had no problems at all using their spa and pool facilities.Underground for moving around Tokyo is next to the hotel.A part from the pool problem i really liked the Prince Gallery, but don't know if I would be back if this rule goes on.","Rome, Italy","gmilestravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rome, Italy</strong>",107,4.0

The hotel comes under Luxury Collection for SPG Starwood which all hotels have merged in August under the major brand group of the Marriott.There are spectacular views of Tokyo from all room types due to the fact the hotel starts from the 36th level and no other building to obstruct it. There is a glass sliding door on each level after you exit the lift where you need to swipe your key card for added security to the guest to their rooms. We had a Deluxe King Room facing over Akasaka Chiyoda-ku shopping district and restaurant precinct. The rooms are exceptionally clean and very well maintained, quite spacious and modern in contemporary design. Our king bed felt bigger than normal was very comfortable, it also had a long window seat to sit and lay down and enjoy the view and I believe all room types have similar. The block out blind and curtain are electronically controlled so you don't even have to move out of bed. The shower and bath area has two glass walls allowing natural light in where you don't feel enclosed in a room, however with a flick of switch the glass becomes obscure for privacy, they're appointed with beautiful white grey marble and stainless fixtures!!! The toilet light comes on as you enter with the toilet lid slowly raising itself up and or down with motion senses. The amenities selection in the bathroom to be honest I have never seen so many and the quality was very good. Massive television screen, great coffee station along with snacks and mini bar if you're into that sort of thing. Every night we had a little bag of macaroons left for turn down service which was lovely. Beautiful Asian style robes to wear as well, however when you have a husband who is 6ft tall and has broad shoulders it posed a little problem.All the staff were exceptionally polite as Japanese people are always and they were most helpful with any questions we had from directions, tours basically everything. Some of their English was good however you need slow down for some so they're able to understand because our accent even though we speak perfect English sounds in a different way to them but thats normal for a lot of countries and not an issue.The Oasis Garden restuarant has all day dining and where we had our buffet breakfast everyday. There is also a Japanese restaurant Washoku Souten located on the lower level by stairs for full traditional Asian breakfast. Oasis Garden restaurant food quality and selection was very good and caters very well for westerners and also has asian dishes including traditional asian style breakfast. As the restuarant takes up half of the 36th level it has three side viewing aspects, we sat in a different side each morning to take in each of the spectacular views over Tokyo. A few mornings at breakfast was a little chaotic at the peak time of 9 to 9.30am where one of the staff members was a little overwhelmed with so many people but that was the only issue we had for our entire stay. If you can go earlier for breakfast do so as we found 8 to 8.30am made a difference of less crowding. We only dined in the hotel for breakfast as we wanted to experience Tokyo at other meal times. In regards to in room dining we did try one evening due to returning back very late at night from a Mt Fuji all day trip and to be honest didn't like the menu, I suppose because wasn't enough western choices.The Akasaka-Mitsuke subway train is only 5 minute walk across the road from the hotel building and the best way to get around Tokyo. The famous Shibuya is about a 10 minute subway ride and a few minutes more after a change to the JR Line above ground train to Harajuku. Akasaka has a huge selection of restuarants only five minutes away from Japanese, Italian, French, Korean, Seafood and Sushi choices. There are a few convenience stores 5 minutes away as well for anything you might need as well as a major shopping centre if you're needing something really close by.Overall we had a wonderful, luxury stay and highly recommend the hotel and will return again very soon!!!","Gold Coast, Australia","SIKALAS_AUS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast, Australia</strong>",15,5.0

What made me stay at this hotel this trip was mainly because of Mr. Shuta Takeuchi from the Concierge desk. He went over the top in helping me to secure reservations from hard-to-book restaurants and even golf course as a single player. He was always proactive in his suggestions and extremely responsive (usually replied within the same day). This is a big contrast to some of the other 5 star hotels I stayed before in Japan which they tend to offer cookie-cutter suggestions and don't think outside the box.,,Andrew W,7,5.0

Fiji. We decided to stay at Prince Kiochio based on its great reviews and our Starwood SPG gold status. There were many nice things about the Prince Kiochio property. The grounds are lovely and adjacent to many convenient stores and restaurants. We booked a standard club room, which was surprisingly spacious and comfortable and had beautiful views of the Tokyo Tower and the city skyline. The room was very modern and cool, and the highlights were the awesome window seat and the privacy glass of the bathroom (so cool!). The club lounge was comfortable and had an excellent selection of snacks and liquors. However, despite these niceties, there were many problems with our stay. The biggest problem was that a lot of the staff seemed cold and impersonable, more so than any where else we stayed in Japan. We drove to the hotel in the late evening after the Ayu concert, and there was no coordination between the valet and the front desk to give us a white glove welcome to the hotel. We were not escorted to our suite on arrival, and we were not offered any welcome refreshments. Though the room we booked was comfortable, we were surprised that we were not offered a room or suite upgrade and not given any membership gifts. At breakfast, the staff was not attentive, and acted as if they were annoyed at our requests and only came by if we literally stood up and flagged the staff down. My husband used the shoe shine service (supposedly shoes are returned same day)— no one returned his shoes and he finally had to call for return since we were checking out. Housekeeping staff walked into our room twice, merely because the “do not disturb” light was off — I’ve never stayed at a resort or hotel where the housekeeping manager didn’t call first to double check, if the guests were known to still be on the property! And it seemed like there was zero communication between the desk, club lounge and car port to retrieve/deliver our car while we were there. The club lounge desk staff was polite enough, but like the front desk reception, did zero to add to or assist our stay. The service, concierge and reception paled in comparison to our subsequent stays at the Tokyo Four Seasons and Hoshinoya, as well as our stays at other 4 and 5-star properties in our trip across Japan.

Quite inconvenient when maintenance staff has to come to your room at midnight when you are in your pyjamas. Ours had to be replaced every day. Also having a glass wall between the bathroom and the room is most inconvenient as when you have to use the bathroom or the toilet the lights come on automatically and wake up your partner.It was extremely surprising that very few of the staff spoke any English especially as the service at breakfast in the dining room was very disorganised.

Luckily, the A/C worked fairly well in the room and was able to keep it cool enough to sleep. This is not always the case in Tokyo hotels, even the luxury properties. The deluxe king room is very well appointed and nice - good quality build with great views and a nice shower/bathroom. It had all of the typical Japanese technologies and was very quiet with unobtrusive service.Our primary issues during our week stay were the following:1) The down pillows and comforter were not only a bit hot, but on more than one occasion, did not smell fresh. We weren't sure if it was the down itself that had an odor or the cases and sheets. 2) Service was uneven. The front desk and porter service was quite good; however, breakfast service was not always friendly and often robotic. Additionally, because of the issue above (odor of pillows/comforter) we asked housekeeping for a room freshening spray we could use to mask the odor. We were heading out for the day and they said they would inquire about this. When we returned, there was a note saying that they have room freshener in their gift shop we could purchase. This was not exactly the kind of response we hoped to receive. On two particular occasions, breakfast service was not accommodating. The first instance centered around the Japanese breakfast set which we ordered and takes 20 minutes to prepare. The breakfast hours are until 10am and we had arrived at 9:45am. When we ordered the Japanese set, the waiter looked at his watch and even had to check if we were allowed to order this set at that time. This is unacceptable at a luxury hotel since we arrived before the official closing of breakfast at 10am and made us rather uncomfortable. Additionally, we ordered tea and went to the buffet to get some bakery products and after bringing them back to the table were told we weren't allowed to take items from the buffet if getting the Japanese set. This was not conveyed to us when we ordered the Japanese set, nor did it say so on the menu, again an uncomfortable moment. On another day, we wanted to move to a corner table after being seated and were told the table was reserved and we were not allowed to move. This was at 9:50am and when I asked what time the reservation was for since breakfast is closing in 10 minutes, I was met with silence. About 5 minutes later we were told we were allowed to move to the table. Overall, service during breakfast was uneven and typically we were met with ""no"" or told about a particular rule in a not particularly productive tone. 3) Breakfast quality - Although the buffet was large and many items were of good quality, there were also several that were not. The danish and pastries were soft and appeared not homemade. Additionally, they were the exact same every day, similar to other items like the mango pancakes which were good, but switching out the fruit each day would've made them better. There were also a distinct lack of healthy options especially coming from the kitchen which tended to focus on fried foods and eggs. Some homemade items using almond milk, yogurt and fresh nuts and berries would've been nice. The redundancy of the items, lack of quality, and uneven service persuaded us to go elsewhere on a couple mornings even though we had breakfast included in our room rate. Overall, this hotel is well maintained and located in a quiet, but accessible location in Tokyo. Improvements in breakfast quality and service would move it into the top among other hotels in Tokyo.","Shenandoah, Virginia","mlb999</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shenandoah, Virginia</strong>",103,4.0

I am aware that Japanese energy saving regulations are in place, bit weird enough never encountered this in other hotels in Tokyo.

This included the Michelin Star restaurant Tempura Motoyoshi. I truly appreciate the effort she went through to secure these reservations for me. I stayed in a Club Deluxe room, which was beautiful. Decor is chic, modern and understated. And the layout is perfect. The bed sleeps like a dream, but the view is the best part. The blackout shades are essential when dealing with jetlag.

Therefore, I can only base my assessment against the standards i have seen in hotels elsewhere in the world, but I am not sure how it measures up against other hotels in Japan.I was impressed from beginning to end. The service levels I had experienced throughout my 4-night stay left me with pretty much nothing to complain about. People were polite, helpful, well-organised, and efficient. I did not see any of the staff members put a foot wrong.Everything was precisely and efficiently executed. Things went according to plan, and there were no surprises in service delivery, which is greatly-appreciated, especially when I am travelling on business. I had ordered in-room dining for several of my breakfasts and dinners, and each time, the delivery arrived at precisely the requested time - down to the minute. Pretty much it was the same for the laundry service and other stuff. I found myself planning my time very precisely in the latter part of my stay, as if I was reliving my military days again.I had gotten so used to the precision that when one morning, my breakfast arrived four minutes early when I was still washing up, and I was taken aback. If breakfast arrived four minutes early when I am in almost anywhere else in the world, I would have been delighted, but it felt different in this hotel - such was the high standards the hotel was performing to during my stay.The high standards were also apparent in the maintenance and upkeep of the room and the hotel in general. Everything was clean and well-maintained. Things worked the way they were expected to. Other than a negligible point of a depleted battery in the bathroom weighing scale, I am hard-pressed to think of any other instance when something did not work. There is, however, no way that I am going to fault anyone for something as trivial as this though.The room was also spacious and comfortable. Practicality was obviously top-of-mind when the designers were working on the room, and again I am sure many business travellers would be pleased with that.The views from the room was amazing, and it was a most welcome bonus for a first-time visitor to the city. I got a room offering a view of the imperial palace and Tokyo Skytree.A tad expensive, but would love to be back again!","Singapore, Singapore","MelvinLin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",259,5.0

In Tokyo, Japan? Real room price will cost me arm and legs, still to this day I still cannot believe it, many plat member just got upgraded to corner room, and its already very huge and comfortable, some more reason for the next few days, the hotel in Tokyo will be very full. Thank you again Prince Gallery for the chance.Check in is fast, as I think our room is prepared, we were approached by staffs that walk to us to our waiting table, even at check-in lounge you can feel the luxury , staffs explain thoroughly what is the benefit for us, extend the complimentary BF, of course very polite and attentive, and want to make sure that all our needs fulfilledWhile entering the room, we are stunned, its really really hugeeeeee, from what I can remember, its the largest room that I every stay, come on, 100m2, in Tokyo? even the bathroom is larger than most Tokyo's hotel room. :P.This hotel a bit hightech, have a single app on provided ipad to control room's electrical and curtain.The suite is on the corner, what a beautiful view of Tokyo.This hotel think of everything, they have charger and cables (lighting n micro usb) provided in the room, even in the safety box, they have power outlet, wow, such attention to detail and need.Bathup facing Tokyo Skyscraper is on another level, I think I spend almost one hour just to enjoy the view and comfort, did I mention there is a TV in bath up with channel and volume control attached to the wall? so you don't have to worry by using remote control (there is no remote control), it will be wet or fall to bath up, :D.Club is wonderful, have sufficient and variety of food, a perfect place to unwind, didn't try the swimming pool, just make a quick visit, sure will try on another visit, it will be interesting to enjoy the view while relaxing on the pool, even the smoking room feels luxurious. Smokers like me will feel the impressive and proximity.Breakfast have various Japanese and Western a la carte menu, they even have AN very beautiful Japanese BF presentation, staffs are all attentive to detail, once in a while will check whether you need something to fulfill your craving, I even watch some staff rearrange buffet food so its perfectly align and make art to the eye, even if there is one dot dirt in the table, which not really visible, they will clean it as fast as possible, that a well-trained staffs. :DWe request for late check out till 4 pm which granted with no problem, it's really sad to leave such a top notch hotel as wife want to do shopping in Ginza area and we move to another hotel. Our check out at Club is swift n easy. 5 thumbs up for concierge team to prepare our luggage for departure, such a good gesture.Thank you Prince Gallery a very amazing experience, sure will be back on next visit to Tokyo, :D","Medan, Indonesia","quinjoe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Medan, Indonesia</strong>",102,5.0

We are SPG gold elite members and had beautiful rooms that were upgrades (within the same class but better view) to the corner room on 31st floor and for our partners to the 38th. The service was good, the concierge great, the lounge room beautifully discreet and private. In fact the whole hotel was luxurious and lovely. I swam every day, we ate in both the hotel‘s restaurants and I was happy. Breakfast was good to. BUT we returned to the hotel after traveling around Japna, for one night from 14th - 15th June and Haba very different experience. We were all quite tired from the three hour train journey from Hiroshima back to Tokyo and just wanted to settle into our rooms. The rooms they offered us did not have an upgrade though. I sent our parents up to the lounge, they were dropping from fatigue and spent over 20 minutes trying to straighten out the upgrades. The receptionist told me that we‘d have to be platinum members to get an automatic upgrade. This is something no other hotel or company has said before and I felt like I was having to really negotiate with someone tough. She offered us a slightly bigger room, but no upgrade to our parents room. I asked to speak to the manager. I had already been standing there for 20 minutes. Mr Tetsuji Yonemoto, the assistant manager, sorted out two rooms next to one another which were just a tiny bit larger. We were leaving very early so really they could have given us a suite and it would have been vacated by 9am the next day. I pointed out to Mr Yonemoto that at the Osaka Marriott Miyako Hotel this is exactly what happened. We stayed one night there and were leaving very early in the morning. They upgraded us to a suite and our partners to a room on the 54.h floor. They are on the same SPG alliance as The Princes Gallery, but we’re flexible. The Prince Gallery were not flexible at all. This is not good for either repeat customers, or those who have a high customer status within a hotel chain. This happened once before in Yangon and the hotel manager did apologize and sent up a cake and a bottle of champagne, at least by way of some small compensation for the room mess up. Mr Yonemoto did apologize, but seemed incapable, or unable to help us further. This left a very sour taste for all four of us. And a hotel I would have unstintingly recommended to others, I would now hesitate over.","Santiago, Chile","Robber222</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santiago, Chile</strong>",110,3.0

However, we decided to try the Prince Gallery because we wanted to stay in a Starwood property, and this was the highest rated one for Tokyo. Well, we were exceptionally pleased with this hotel's service, rooms, facilities and location. The trip was an anniversary trip for my husband and me, and we had 2 of our kids with us. Our kids must have emailed the hotel in advance to let them know that we were celebrating an anniversary trip. When we arrived we were told that we had been upgraded to a suite, and when we were shown to our room, there was a beautiful chocolate and macaron plate and a nice congratulatory note from management. The suite was a corner suite, w/ an incredible view of the Tokyo skyline, and the furnishings were modern and beautiful. The location of the hotel - very close to a train station and in a beautiful building in a lovely area - is excellent.We had access to the lounge which was a nice plus as we could go in and get drinks during the day if we stopped back to the hotel. There wasn't a lot in the way of food offerings at the lounge, it wasn't a place where you'd go for a meal other than breakfast maybe if you didn't want to eat in the main restaurant.The pool, fitness center and spa are lovely, with a long lap pool that was never that crowded. It was a great way to start the day.Breakfast buffet here is good and the service is pleasant, but it did get very crowded on Sundays when people from outside the hotel come in and sometimes they ran out of things and didn't restock.The concierges were really helpful - we had messaged before our arrival, and they arranged for great restaurant reservations for us so that we didn't have to do that when we arrived. The location is pretty close to Ginza and the Imperial Gardens, and on top of one train station and near another. There are plenty of places to eat nearby as well.All in all, we had a great stay at this hotel, and will absolutely stay here on our next Tokyo visit.

We then had 5 nights at Suiran Kyoto, 2 nights at the Ritz-Carlton Kyoto, and ended with 3 nights at the St Regis Osaka.The Prince Gallery Tokyo hotel is truly stunning, offering a very modern Art Deco-inspired Japanese minimalist design throughout all of its public spaces and rooms/suites. The hotel design feels right at home in Tokyo's Chiyoda district, yet has its own design aesthetic that feels distinct from any of the other luxury hotels in the city.The Prince Gallery far exceeded even my lofty expectations and is a truly outstanding luxury hotel option for Tokyo. We loved its modern design, its use of technology, its spacious suite, and its amazing concierge and service team. While we did have some English language issues, those were usually quickly resolved by the service team.We also really loved the views from everywhere in the hotel--and the amazing toilets and technology that were so well integrated and easy to use. Platinum recognition here is truly impressive--especially for me as an Ambassador level guest. I was checked in at 7:15 am and got upgraded to a Kioi Suite despite there having been no suites available for over a week! The hotel clearly had pre-assigned a suite for us due to my status and due to the fact that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary on this trip.The concierge team here is world class. They arranged dinner reservations far in advance for us at 3 Michelin star Sushi Yoshitake and 2 Michelin star Narisawa. Even a few weekls before our arrival, they also were able to arrange lunch for us at 2 Michelin star Sushi Sawada. Really impressive for a city where such bookings can be very tough to arrange.Not only was the concierge able to get those, but they also arranged a private Samurai lesson for us with Tetsuro Shimaguchi, the Kill Bill Vol. 1 swordfight choreographer and actor who played Miki, leader of the Crazy 88. It was incredible! The concierge also arrange a fabulous private city tour for us on the morning of our arrival...and personalized it for us based on our requests.The concierge team certainly is among the best in the city--easily within the top few.We also had the chance to visit the Aman, Peninsula, Mandarin Oriental, and Four Seasons while in Tokyo. The only hotel with comparably excellent hard product is the Aman--but we experienced the same language challenges there even while only having tea. We also had a few service issues in seeing rooms at the Aman, and even on getting something to ease some stomach issues. The MO had quite dated decor and furnishings in its rooms, though it has a number of different F/B outlets. The FS was extremely disappointing, offering a brusk greeting, no real public spaces, and rooms that looked like they belong in an older Park Hyatt. No wonder that they are opening a new Four Seasons soon.Seeing the other hotels made us realize how special the Prince Gallery truly is. It is one of the best hard products of any hotel in Tokyo, and its soft product can compete with anyone--and will only improve as the English capabilities of its staff improve. We would gladly return in a heartbeat to the Prince Gallery for any future trips to Tokyo!","Newport Beach, California","BillR2390</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newport Beach, California</strong>",1747,5.0

Very luxurious feeling with great staff who can't do enough for you. The bar is very cool (although eye wateringly expensive at £13 a pint!) and has fabulous views over Tokyo, as do the rest of the public areas. The pool and gym are also very clean and modern and well equipt. the location is also very good - the subway can be reached by going directly underneath the hotel. There is also a wide variety of restaurants and a supermarket underneath the hotel.The rooms are very spacious and as the hotel is on the 32nd to 36th floors of this building they have great views over Tokyo. They are very modern - the room controls such as lighting and temperature are all touch screen, There are loads of toiletries and thoughtful extras. The bathroom has a massive deep soaking tub and rainfall shower, the beds are huge and comfortable, there is a big cushioned window seat for relaxing on, the TV is huge.... I could go on and on. The room was also immaculately clean and decorated beautifully. There was a daily turndown service too which was nice. We had paid for a club class room which I highly recommend doing as it gave us access to the club lounge which had a wide array of drinks (including alcohol from 5pm onwards) and snacks available all day and was a really nice place to go and relax after a long days sightseeing. We also ate breakfast in there each day. It was never particularly busy and it was a really great addition to the stay being able to use it.There were only 2 negatives for me - we had to get the airport limousine at 7am to get tot he airport and breakfast doesn't start until 7am, so we had to miss it. I did enquire if there was any way we could get anything to eat earlier and was advised that the only thing we could do was order from the 24 hour room service, which is an additional expense and which also doesn't have any real breakfast options. It would have been nice if the hotel were able to provide us something to take with us on the airport limousine (especially since it is an almost 2 hour journey) like a takeaway hot drink and maybe some fruit and pastry or similar. I have stayed at other hotels of a similar calibre who do offer a simple takeaway breakfast for guests who have to depart before standard breakfast service times. The other thing is the lighting setup in the bathrooms - the bathroom has glass walls so you can see fully in to the bathroom from the room. There is a privacy button which, once pressed, makes the glass opaque. This is a very cool feature, however when the bathroom light is on and the glass is opaque the light from the bathroom also lights up the bedroom - not as brightly as the bathroom itslef but still quite a lot. This isn't a problem in the day but we found that if one of us gets up in the night to use the toliet the light from the bathroom lit up the bedroom and disturbed the other person. Obviously you can go to the toilet without turning on the main bathroom light but the light in the toilet area is automatic and so comes on as soon as you go in there, so you can't help but light up the bedroom a bit. It was also annoying in the morning - I get up earlier than my husband and tend to get showered and ready whilst he sleeps longer, but I needed to turn the bathroom light on to take a shower etc and this disturbed him. Neither issues are major problems and wouldn't put me off staying in the hotel as all, but I would bring an eye mask for sleeping next time! Overall I would highly recommend this hotel.","York, United Kingdom","MANGOKITTEN82</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>York, United Kingdom</strong>",17,5.0

I feel compelled to write this one because of the way the hotel staff made us feel unwelcome and their inflexible and rigid attitude left us with a very unpleasant feeling about the hotel, notwithstanding the nice facilities and food.I am an SPG Platinum member and I wrote ahead to the hotel saying that I usually travel to SPG properties on business but this time I was traveling with my wife and 8 year old son, and I would therefore appreciate something special (service) for them. The concierge replied with a rigid and “standard” email stating that my son was not allowed to use the pool, and that lounge access was restricted to guest plus (two people per room), so my son could not use it. I found this response very strange and unlike the warm and flexible service that I usually receive at high-end SPG properties. I replied that I would be on business most of the time so I assume my wife and son could use the lounge.When we arrived at the hotel, it was raining and we decided to stay in. Given that my son is 8, he cannot use the lounge in the afternoon (cocktail hour) and I had breakfast planned with my company so I would not use it. I asked if they could reconsider allowing all of us in the lounge (without paying a small fortune for access, as the prices are designed for adults and not for small kids). Perhaps a good compromise could be that my wife and I use the lounge at cocktail hour (2 guests only) and my wife and son would use it for breakfast (2 guests). That way we stayed within their rigid guideline of two guests per room. I was happy and relieved they accepted this solution, and we had a good first night and day. The next day, however, my wife and I arrived at the lounge. The night manager promptly arrived and explained that we had only agreed that for the first night, and that this second night we were not allowed to use the lounge. I explained this was not correct, as the reception manager the night before clearly offered to have us pay for 2 nights, so the discussion was always for the entire stay (2 nights). He would not have it, and we were escorted out of the lounge. This was the most embarrassing and awful experience my wife and I have ever experienced at an SPG property, and our my son kept asking why he was not welcome at this hotel. In short:• The staff simply follow (rigid) rules and don’t think for themselves how to make guests feel welcome – particularly SPG Platinums• The staff, including concierge and reception have very poor English skills – a big part of this was lack of language ability• The rules in the hotel and very family and child unfriendly (children cannot use lounge or pool, lounge has guest + 1 limit)• The hotel is very SPG unfriendly (no welcome present for Platinum, non-status members have to pay a small fortune for access to pool, etc)Avoid this hotel if you travel with family or guests, or if you have SPG status. Also avoid if you have special requests or appreciate friendly, flexible, service minded staff that speak English. For me, this ruined my stay. And it was not the facilities, it was the way the staff made us feel unwelcome and not appreciated.","Hong Kong, China","HK-SPG71</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",12,1.0

But our jaws dropped when the elevator doors opened and we saw the view and lights of the city scene (we arrived very late at night). And we keep being impressed the entire stay with every new discovery. I loved the artwork all over the hotel and thought it a very good idea to have a book in the rooms explaining or showing the art pieces throughout the hotel. Our absolute favorite feature, though, was the automatic black-out shower wall. We had so much fun just hitting the button to watch the wall go from translucent to opaque so quickly. It took me a little while to find the bathroom amenities as the majority of them were in a drawer. But the quality and variety of what was offered was top notch. We loved the special touch of providing the his and hers yukatas and snacks. I absolutely loved the window bench seat and the ability to pop open a spot to get fresh air in - even on the 32nd floor. The view was the best part of the room. We slept with the blinds open so we could thoroughly enjoy the night lights and watch the sunrise. The breakfast buffet was good - nice variety and tasty. On our last day before checking out, we actually chose not to leave and go do anything so that we could just stay in the hotel and enjoy ourselves at the hotel. It was extremely quiet, clean, awesome water pressure, fast wifi. I can't think of a single complaint or critique. Would definitely stay here again.","Houston, Texas","mmlosey1119</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",76,5.0

They wanted us to wait in the corridor for 15 mins while the restaurant was half empty.I ended up speaking with the manager on duty who kept apologizing but ""these are the rules"".

Location is a hit and miss. Plenty to do on weekdays (it’s a business area packed with offices), less on the weekends, BUT there are many subway stations in proximity of the hotel so you can go everywhere in Tokyo in just a few minutes. Coming from Haneda by train was super easy, and on our departure day we used the Airport Limousine Bus that stops right by the hotel and goes straight to Narita.In the basement of the hotel building there’s plenty of restaurants, bars, a supermarket and a convenience store open 24h. We always started our days with a coffee by Dean & Deluca downstairs.Our Deluxe Room, located on the 33rd floor, was comfortable, clean and quite spacious. Turndown service every night with bottled water and chocolates or macarons. Loved the iPad and the shower glass that can be “frosted” with a button so you can’t see anything from the room (this sometimes is a problem with the modern hotel rooms with an open bathroom).Service was generally quite good all around the hotel.. some things at the bar (nice for the views over the city) could be improved but overall we can’t complain.Only thing that prevents me from wanting to come back here is the fact that I forgot some of my clothes in the closet, realized it back at home one day later, contacted immediately the hotel (weird fact: I had to call them in Japan as it’s impossible to find an email), asked if they could send me back my things to Italy - at my own expenses- and their answer was that they didn’t find anything in the room. How’s that the housekeeper couldn’t find my clothes left in the closet?Needless to say that this episode ruined my experience at The Prince Gallery and that this is also the reason why I can’t give a higher rate to this hotel.","Rimini, Italy","bierre1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rimini, Italy</strong>",362,4.0

The hotel made you feel like a valued guest which is somewhat rare these days.All in all a spectacular hotel with fantastic views and absolutely fabulous service.Three small improvement areas as again the review is based on the hotel rating and price:1. No one asked if our stay was ok when we checked out - basic error and disappointing especially when it was great.2. The metal cladding in the breakfast area (around the columns) was covered in hand prints and stains - this was a let down based on the hotel as this is the sort of detail that counts.3. While the breakfast was good the options from the menu were limited to Japanese breakfast or two styles of egg. With the amount of staff and the size of the buffet this could have been much better.That said, these are small improvements that would not put me off coming back.

Our cocktails were so-so - the Champagne Mojito very nice, but the Tea & Orange cocktail very watered down by the bucket of crushed ice that they had used in it. So, in short, great with some short-comings, but for that price, I would've expected more.","Frankfurt, Germany","anneri-wilwarin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Frankfurt, Germany</strong>",14,4.0

The design has been finished to an extremely high standard - really stunning finish. As soon as you work into the hotel it feels luxurious. Even on the ground floor before reaching the beautiful sky lobby the smell of the hotel is amazing (not sure what it was!).The reception staff of this hotel are extremely professional and welcoming. It was lovely being shown to our hotel room. The club lounge staff were also extremely friendly and welcoming. Drinks offered are high quality however we didn't find the afternoon/ evening food had much flavour. During one of the nights the lounge was full but we were allowed to take drinks back to our room. We stayed at this hotel twice. The second visit was in a corner suite. Although the view was really amazing we didn't like the room as much. The corner suite is long and narrow so it actually felt more cramped. Also quite a lot of the furniture was chipped which is a shame. ,"Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","amh723</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom</strong>",18,5.0

Although a platinum member, sadly no upgrade or other recognition other than to ask if I wanted points or a small gift (chopsticks). Dinner in the Oasis restaurant (their main restaurant) was, by far, the worst I had during my 3 week trip around Japan. The hotel had a very impersonal feeling. Staff were nice, but did not go out of their way to help. Later during my trip, I stayed at the Marriott in Osaka - a very similar property - and had a much nicer (and significantly less expensive) experience. The location is decent, but not great.

We arrived at 2pm, were quickly escorted to the lobby & then onto the club lounge, having booked a deluxe king club room for two nights. Check in was smoothest we’ve had in Japan with champagne welcome drinks. The hotel is ‘upside down’ in that the lobby is on the top floor, 36th. Club lounge is on the 34th floor. We had a top floor room and the view was breathtaking. I’d imagine all rooms have expansive views of Tokyo. The club deluxe room is of great size - plenty of space & the bay window with seating is impressive and gives a bigger appearance and feel to the room. What sets this property apart from others we’ve stayed in, are the in-room facilities & features. The iPad control is impressive - as numerous people have mentioned. The see through bathroom turns to frosted glass with a touch of a button - quirky & impressive. Another note of the in-room facilities, the kettle is a well sized delonghi. I know if I was reading this review and noted that, I might not see it as a big deal but this sets the tone for everything else in the room being of high quality. Club lounge has breakfast, afternoon tea with delicious pastries & evening cocktails with canapés. The service in the club lounge is the best I’ve experienced, special mention to Kentaro Usami the Club Lounge Manager for his wonderful service. I feel his service makes the club lounge experience what it should be and this is what sets this club lounge apart in terms of service, from others we have experienced throughout the world. The only negative I would give is that breakfast at Oasis was a let down. Service was rather non-existent and impersonal. A further note on service, the hotel went to great lengths to locate my sunglasses which I left in the taxi (the journey itself was eventful as the driver wasn’t sure how to get to the hotel despite me giving the hotel name and address in Japanese so I spent the journey directing him via google maps!)The gym, spa & swimming pool are of great standard as one would expect of a recently opened 5* property in Tokyo. Overall, I highly recommend this property & club lounge access if budget allows. I feel our stay may not have been as impressive if it were not for the club lounge, given our experience of breakfast at Oasis.

There are many reasons why, first it sits on top of a building giving it expansive views of the city, once you enter your room you think you have the best view, then you goto breakfast and realize every room has the best view. Skytree, Shinjuku, shibuya all within viewing distance. Next is the distance the hotel has from multiple amazing metro lines that connect you to the city with a metro station that’s never overwhelmed. Get to shibuya or ginza within 25min or less, the hotel sits in the middle of the city. I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights, the room was a king standard, space was average along with bathroom, enough for 2. The huge window had an amazing view with a sitting area on the window-sill. Room was fully automated, electronic curtains and lights with different scenes all controllable from a central controller. This room had an ipad which was useful for localized information. The TV was flush mounted into the wall, that was a first for me. The bathroom was beyond me. The shower glass wall separated the room from the bathroom, essentially you could take a shower and see the view clearly. If you wanted privacy, a single button turns on some sort of privacy shield in a blink of an eye creating a virtual wall, ive never seen anything like it. The toilet cover opens as soon as the door opens, flush mechanism was mounted to the wall with various options. The shower itself has plenty of pressure along with a rain shower and a huge tub. The cabinets that lined the entry of the room were equipped to store an entire suitcase if needed, plenty of drawers and hanging space. The room itself and the location along with the value of the price makes staying here a no brainer. 100% if I ever go back im staying here.","Atlanta, Georgia","TattooedPassport</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",81,5.0

Oddly we couldn’t find it when we got to the right stop - the key was to look up :) we were stood directly beneath it (its atop a commercial building - extremely modern and shiny). Express elevator to the reception which has stunning views across the city together with a cocktail bar which is absolutely stunning. Check in was excellent and service couldn’t be more efficient. Our club room was absolutely lovely - quite large given our expectations were lower from war stories. Beautifully appointed room wi5h picture window views across the city again (its difficult not to have excellent views from all angles of this hotel given its height and all windows being floor to ceiling). Visited the Club Lounge on our first evening and were told it was full which was a little off putting (admittedly a Saturday night but even so, not really acceptable) staff were a little embarrassed and tried to work things out with a number of couples who were in the same position. Eventually we got seats - drinks and food were good quality but what we found after staying there 5 nights was that the food didn’t actually change from day to day which was slightly disappointing. Service however was very attentive.Visited the pool and gym several times (remember to take your swim cap - but they will lend you one if you forgot) - Wowzer! The pool and views across the city are unforgettable - with a bit of jet lag we got up to swim and use the gym very early as the city was waking up - loved it. There’s also an onsen of its own which is another lovely way to relax after a day of walking etc.Club lounge quietened down from second night and was easily accessible with very lovely staff and drinks. Breakfast is served in the same lounge (or you can go down to the restaurant) - eggs cooked whichever way you want and then lots of other choices. Good range, but again this doesn’t show any variety over a period of time which was a little disappointing.Hotel location is central and next to two metro line stations. (Public transport across Tokyo is, without exception, excellent and have never felt safer at all times of day / night).Overall the experience was excellent - indeed, so excellent that we stayed again in our way back from Kyoto.

It is a stunning hotel on the upper floors of a tall building near Akasaka-Mitsuke station which has the very convenient Marunouchi subway line. From check-in to check-out, our stay was flawless. The staff speaks English and is extremely friendly and polite. The hotel was full so we did not get an upgrade but we were in a lovely King room with a wonderful view of the city, especially at night. Everything is very modern in the room, from the ""robot"" toilet that opens when you slide the door open, to the iPad that you can use for room service to the control panel that lets you control the lights, blinds, curtains, do not disturb, etc. The room was also silent - no hallway or adjacent room noise which I LOVED. The doors and construction are solid! The other areas of the hotel are also lovely. We went to the bar one day for a drink; the view is beautiful but at night it's lit up and very stunning. We did not eat in the actual hotel restaurant though we did have room service dinner a couple of times, which is a little limited. The restaurant may have more offerings than the room service menu. We did eat breakfast every morning in the Club Lounge on the 34th floor which, in my opinion, was fantastic. The lounge itself was lovely with yet another beautiful view, and the spread for breakfast was delightful. Eggs to order, Japanese and western breakfast offerings like vegetables, onigiri, fish, bacon, and yogurt. Lots of pastries, salads, quinoa, and of course coffee and juice. It was a treat every morning.I have only two small critiques: one is that the mattress was *very* firm, which might be tough for some people. The other is that the bathroom is walled in with glass (which can be screened using the control panel for privacy). That by itself was great, but there was a motion detector in the WC so when you stepped in there in the middle of the night, the light would pop on, potentially disturbing your partner in bed. Those two things aside, and it was a flawless stay.Finally, the staff was so helpful and assisted us in getting our limo bus tickets back to the airport the day before our departure. I would absolutely stay here again in a heartbeat. Everything was beautiful and in wonderful condition; the accommodations were very comfortable, and the staff was fantastic.

The front desk and conseigre staffs especially were eager to help me to answer all my questions and arrange all my needs.

With all the top end amenities.The location is also very central with serval metro lines just 5 mins walks within the hotel. It is also 40 mins commute from haneda airport with made things easier.Food wise, the mall below the hotel offers great selections of restaurants, I personally tried 3 of the japnese style places and each were really good. As well there is a area where there are a lot of restaurants and bars just within a short walk of hotel.If i were to nitpick, i would agree with my fellow reviewers about this hotel. The breakfast can be improved for sure. I spent two mornings having breakfast, to be specific. The food was good, and everything was prepared quite well. But it is quite small and lack selections. And the two times i ate there the food offered is exactly the same.If i were to eat there for 5 days straight, i think i would get bored and tired of eating the same food everyday.Would I recommend this hotel? For sure yes. If you are like me who likes everything to be new and have staffs pamper you then this is the place for you.",,michaelcV245HC,5,5.0

This is one of the few places where I would definitely recommend against getting the B&B package. The Japanese restaurant at dinner was actually surprisingly good (modern Japanese cuisine). The important thing is that the hotel is part of the Tokyo Garden complex, which has lots of restaurants, services and shops to choose from.Location: It's in Akasaka sort of, but the immediate surrounding neighborhood is not much to look at.

It was great this year, as well as last year.I ordered twice the In-room dining which is okay, meeting the standard but not exceeding it. It is very simple, not surprisingly good. The portion of American breakfast is not big. Bread should have come with a toaster. Food was not stored in heated box when they came. No one asked me how many people were using the meal. So, there wes not enough utensils, and no extra serving bowl and dishes. No toothpicks, no salt and pepper. With that price, it is expected to be more in quality and quantity.About the Countdown Party:This is a bit of disappointment. About New Year events in hotel:Some activities are really nicely organized. . My kids went for the Kimono dress-up, and calligraphy on Japanese fan. We wanted to take the rickshaw ride, but there is only one-way and no return ride so we gave up. I think the hotel may consider introducing more events for the new year’s eve and new year’s day.

They upgraded our room to a room with a better view, had a welcome/congratulating amenity waiting in the room along with towels shaped like a swan on the bed and treats with a nice note.

The property is built on a small hill that adds to its advantage in terms of uninterrupted sight lines in almost every direction. The check-in lobby is located on the 36th floor along with its sunken bar and the hotel restaurant. It is reached by an express elevator from the ground level. Rooms are located on this floor and on the six lower floors. The club room is on 34. The club room is large....literally 1 side of the building with floor to ceiling windows, a great buffet selection and a helpful staff.Rooms: 250 large rooms, ranging from 42 square meters to over 100 square meters. The rooms are well appointed with wood trim, large windows and well conceived bathrooms. The corridors are long, but also wide and well appointed. There are three high speed, 'smart' elevators serving the guest rooms.Proximity: There are 5 subway lines reached by underground passages. It is a 15-20 minute trip to Tokyo Station or the Imperial Palace, about the same time as taking a taxi in off-hours (no traffic). The neighborhood abounds with retail, hotels and government buildings. The complex at the base of the hotel (and in surrounding areas) includes dozens of food outlets ranging from noodle shops to Starbucks to fine dining French restaurants.Amenities: indoor pool, hot bath, treatment room and fitness gym located on the 30th floor. The pool is large with one wall of windows with uninterrupted views over the Tokyo skyline. The concierge offers a full range of services.The property amenities, location and views make it an oasis in the middle of busy, chaotic Tokyo.

The Platinum upgrade is the #1 reason individuals like myself stay with SPG. There was no Platinum upgrade, and just for enjoyment I asked the front desk daily if there was an upgrade available. Each time I smiled and waited and in the Japanese style of letting you ""save face"", the hotel clerks made a big to-do of typing on their keyboards, looking at the computer screen, making little faces and then saying ""I'm so sorry we are fully booked"". So if you stay here have an expectation you will receive the room you booked. I went as far as saying any room upgrade would be nice, that we didn't even need the Platinum Suite upgrade. It was clearly NOT happening.I have stayed previously at Ritz Carlton. While the Prince Gallery can run $600-$700/night, the Ritz Carlton should be within $100 if you book in advance and they WILL recognize your Marriott/SPG status. The Ritz Carlton is also 5 star in every way shape and form.What I wasn't appreciative of at the Prince Gallery was a bathroom with a postage stamp size counter. There was no way for two people to get ready at the same time. The shower/bath area was quite large, but the sink area ridiculous. God help you if you had children with you and were trying to get ready in the morning. Breakfast buffet at both the club room and the restaurant was the SAME every day. There was no variety or change in the food presentations. Compare this to the Ritz Carlton club which has a greater variety and higher quality, that changes daily. The same holds true for their breakfast buffet. I was completely bored by the food presentation at both the Oasis restaurant and club level after the 2nd day of our stay. I cannot imagine with the chefs at the Prince Gallery they cannot envision any variety to their club room or buffet breakfast selections. When requesting coffee or tea in the restaurant we found it usually took 10 minutes or more and sometimes ordering a specific tea caused problems because of a lack of English skill and the server not necessarily understanding an American accent. One morning I requested a latte and received tea. The next morning I requested a latte and several minutes later the gal returned to tell me the espresso machine was ""out of order"". Usually at the morning breakfast they would offer you eggs cooked to order but on two occasions they did not, whether because they forgot to ask or it just wasn't being offered that morning. Technology and operations within the rooms at Prince Gallery are fine. Beds are comfortable. Amenities are as expected in a 5 star hotel. What we did not find acceptable were stains on the carpets both in the hallway and within the room. I actually called the front desk and pointed out that there were stains on our carpeting in the room and to please shampoo them. While they may have made an attempt while we were out, it did not in any way look or feel as though they had brought in a machine and cleaned the carpets. There's no way a 5 star hotel should allow stains on the carpets, especially with the prices they are charging.My guess is that Prince Gallery has affiliated with Luxury Collection simply because they wanted to tap into the U.S. tourist and business market. They are a bit nicer than Sheraton and Westin, so that said, it makes sense they would be affiliated with Luxury Collection. There's no way they would have passed branding themselves as a St Regis. The gym and soaking pool within the locker rooms is very nice. Not overly large, but comfortable. They have a NO Tattoo policy and one of the other guests was told to put on long sleeves to be able to use the men's soaking pool. I found this laughably archaic and thankfully I have no tattoos. But it is a nod to older Japanese culture and guests from other countries with tattoos will have a time of it if they want to use the soaking pools in the locker room. I believe there is a separate charge that's $45 or so to use the regular swimming pool. Given the room rates that is also inappropriate in my opinion. I'm giving the Prince Gallery a ""generous"" 4 Star Rating.",Portland,"PDXStocks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland</strong>",466,4.0

YESSo what was missing? For me, having just stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Hong Kong the night before we arrive in Tokyo at the Prince, I was ruined. You see, the Ritz in HK set a new standard for me when it comes to service and really making you feel welcomed and at home (stay tuned for that review).I was so blown away by the service I had received at the Ritz HK and then to arrive at the Prince on my husband's birthday (we both had business and were celebrating his birthday weekend here), and not have any sort of birthday amenity or even a card offered seemed more than a little disappointing. To top it off, we got in around 10pm and the room I had originally booked (a king club room) was not available and they put us in a twin bedroom the night of my husband's birthday (though they did switch us later in our stay).Overall, the Prince was a good hotel, with a wonderful executive club area, but it was missing that personal touch that has a hotel go from good to great.

The most fabulous thing about this hotel is its decoration in public area, so colorful and tasteful. Different kinds of lines and colors and shapes orchestrated to a beautiful and harmonic chapter with its own character. Guest room is nice, though not the one I will wow at the first sight, but it feels good to stay in there and many items they chose are with very good quality. Pool and gym are nice and spacious, and since I stayed in the club floor, I also had access to the locker room and sauna, which I will highly recommend to those who enjoy taking a good bath and beautiful scenery of Tokyo at the same time.Club Lounge is not too big and has a tranquil vibe. The food and drinks offered here are good as well, not to mention that you can see the iconic Tokyo Tower from here, it sparkles in the evening and comes extremely well with your cocktails or nightcaps.I had my breakfast in the All-day Dining Oasis Garden instead of the lounge, which I've enjoyed my tea time and cocktail time. The selection of buffet is excellent, though I chose the Japanese breakfast, which deserved very high ranking among my experiences. The taste was delicate and the presentation was photogenic.Now we move on to the not-so-amazing part of my stay in this hotel- the service. When I checked in, the female staff was not so fluent in English, which to my surprise in a luxury hotel like this (and it calls itself a Luxury Collection Hotel, right?). After that, she looked at me and asked if I can go down to the room by myself (and my huge suitcase stood besides me) or need a bellman to help with luggage and show me the room. I wondered if I did something wrong? It was my first time here and OF COURSE it would be more than pleasant if someone can help, and usually in my stays in other good or luxury hotels, they didn't ask their guest such question, they just did and help, so I was stunned..And what I saw in the Club Lounge (more than once, at least three times) was, the staffs took a glance of the guests who are apparently not Japanese or not Japanese-speaking (like me), but they DID came to ask those Japanese guest what they need served the drinks to their table in person, while foreigners like us were left behind and did our own buffet thing. It was so frustrated to see such things.And while the food at Oasis Garden was excellent, the service was way opposite. During my breakfast, even though there were many staffs walking around, no one stopped by and fill my glass with water, and of course no one to ask if I need some more coffee or tea, and you can easily guess, no one to ask me about my opinion of food. I used to stay in St. Regis Osaka, another top-notched hotel in SPG, and they effortlessly achieve these three requirements I mentioned above.Oh, and please visit their website, you won't find any email address to contact with the hotel. I've reflected this ridiculous thing to SPG and they promised to improve it, but still, the pride and stubbornness of the hotel let it remain the same. I really like its design, but to be called a Luxury hotel, it certainly has a long way to go in service wise.

We are SPG platinum members who travel about 120 days a year. This was our first time in Tokyo so we didn't want to chance anything and we booked in the nicest hotel we could find on the SPG website.The Cons:The room lights, window shades, TV, are all automated on a tablet and touchscreen near your bed. This is all very state of the art and nothing like we have seen to date. The problem is with all this technology it was a hassle constantly as there were repeated communication errors. Doing the simplest thing like turning mood lighting off was a whole ordeal night after night. Very aggravating. The wifi was a disaster as well, constantly dropping and never consistent.I am an athlete so I need to workout in the mornings before I start my day. I was informed on day 1 when I walked into the gym that no tattoos were allowed to be exposed. There is no mention of this on their website or in any literature that I could find. I feel like discrimination like this should be left back for the days when it was tolerated, not in 2017. This policy is wrong on so many levels that I cannot begin to list them all. Mind you I have non-offensive arm tattoos, not an F-U tattooed on my forehead. I didn't travel with any long sleeve workout gear so I had to go shopping to accommodate this ridiculous rule. Needless to say, I only used the gym once after that and I went to a local gym down the street. Are the snobby people in the hotel really going to care about an Amercian guy with arm tattoos working out in the hotel gym? Wasnt body art made popular in Japan anyway????The staff are super overbearing. Its like way too much attention. To make eye contact with you, they would step in front of you as you walked by to get your attention. It isn't a really relaxing environment when you are forced to interact with everyone you walk by. Sometimes you just want to go from point A to point B without being asking 5-6-7 times, ""how are you"", ""is everything ok"", ""can I help you"". Wayyyyyyy too much. Management needs to chill with the pushiness on the employees.Our room wasn't upgraded upon check-in or as a Suite request upgrade months prior. I checked earlier in the day and they had Suites available online. This ticks me off as why have an elite status if the rules aren't honored??The cabs and Uber drivers can't find the place. This is a real pain when trying to go anywhere or get picked up. Pros:Mattress, pillows, room accommodations, room treats, bath amentities, bath fixtures all 5*. All top quality and in perfect shapeVery quiet rooms, hallways, as well as the building, is very secure, you need a keycard to go everywhere. This is all great for sleeping in and having a great night sleep.Being only 6 floors (the top 6 floors of a huge office building) the elevators were very fast. You are never left waiting and rarely ever have to share one. This was great.The club lounge was nice. They have a cook making eggs and their small buffet is 5* compared to all the other club lounges I've been in to date.Nothing is out of place and the building and property are immaculate.All in all, I won't be back because of the discriminating tattoo policy they have. Body art is a form of personal expression like any artist. Similar to having purple hair, a nose piercing or a woman wearing a Burka. I shouldn't have to be explaining this in 2017. Never again.","Scottsdale, Arizona","parisman777</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>",16,3.0

The location was perfect. It's not as busy as places like Shinjuku or shibuya which we find can get a little overwhelming. While it's still a busy area with lots of restaurants and shops close by it also has a slightly more relaxing vibe. It has two stations located less than five minutes walk away and is central so it's very easy to move around the city. The pool, spa and gym area are perfect. They have great views and there is someone constantly checking that everyone is ok. Myself and my partner unfortunately have tattoos which in Japan is not overly accepted in bathing and swimming areas. The staff went out of there way to help us use temporary skin tattoos, which the provide, to cover up so we could enjoy the pool area. They were very apologetic and kind about it.The rooms are wonderful! They are spotless with no wear and tear at all. Everything is high tech and is controlled by iPads. The room is spacious, which is not always the case in Tokyo, it has a well thought out layout and the views are incredible! From almost every spot in the room you can look out of a very large window over the city and nearby parks. Every night they would leave us a turn down present of some water, crackers and macaroons. This hotel only takes up the top few floors of the building so the views are really wonderful. We stayed in rooms 3044 and 3510 both were equally wonderful, I don't think that there is a bad room here. We moved rooms due to spending one night in the middle of our stay on mt fuji and the hotel was kind enough to hold our luggage while we were gone. Once we returned to the hotel the staff noticed we were sunburnt and organised a special rash shirt for us to swim in to avoid us having to place anything on our skin to cover our tattoos. This was such a thoughtful touch and we would like to thank the hotel for this. We booked the buffet breakfast and we would highly recommend it if you do stay here. The selection was plentiful, it was all freshly cooked, tasty and most importantly they do a good coffee. All the staff are incredibly respectful and will go out of there way to help you at any time. They make every person feel important and that they have an enjoyable stay. We will return to Japan and without fail we won't even look at other hotels, we will continue to come back here as there was nothing to fault. We were so happy and can't wait to get back again soon.

The rooms are very comfortable, beds spacious, shower and tub is basically perfect. Work out room very well equipped, pool and Japanese style spa with traditional bathing baths. What is off is the service. Plenty of people around and extremely polite but it's the little detailed things that you expect from St Regis, Ritz and similar quality hotels. Drink orders can take a while and sometimes not correct, concierge recommendations while acceptable are not precisely on mark, and sake servers disappear never to be seen again, and don't even bother with the free sake tasting. Food at Oasis is passable but very expensive for quality and portions. Location is just OK but not the hotel's fault. Very close to 5 subway lines so can get most anywhere but not much in immediate location as far as shops, restaurants and the such and due to that cab fare can get expensive getting around. 3 star rating is for relative as a 5 star hotel. In other words, it is safe, comfortable and has amenities but not up to comparable 5 star hotel expectations.

From the minute your wheels stop rolling you are transported to a universe where you never want to leave. From the assistant who opens your door, to the carrying of any luggage, to opening doors where another person is already holding the elevator for your ride to the hotel reception where everything starts in terms of going anywhere in the hotel. Every single staff member role thereafter is seamless regarding their function and go above and beyond their call of duty. Nothing is too much of an effort for this team at all, no matter what your need is.The interior decor is completely modern and beautifully designed. Their website pictures are great but cannot even to compare with the exquisite detailing from the ceilings, walls, lighting down to the floors. Those enamored with technological gadgets will love how theirs blows ones mind especially when coming from a western world. The Toto is my favorite feature in the bathrooms. I literally want to write a separate article just on this outstanding bathroom toilet. Try it!!! The bedrooms have every necessity provided in packaging which is tasteful and classy. Nothing is overwhelming, just gently understated like the Japanese culture.The restaurants are superb and have all the basic needs for being in Japan with artistry in every piece of crockery, cutlery to serving style. The people friendly environment at the bar area is totally welcoming even for someone like me who doesn't imbibe any alcohol. It converts to a tea area in the afternoons and completely pleasant to sit and observe the ladies meeting daily for their little chit chats. The area in itself is a masterpiece in decor and centrifugal in welcoming you back from a weary day to its calming and amazing presence. I simply loved just sitting here every single day for my tea or coffee and simply being.The sheer convenience of traveling anywhere in Japan is easy from here and a few steps away from shops, restaurants, taxis and the subway system as well as the rail system which all interconnects below and above ground like a spiders web. The hotel will easily assist you with precise maps on exactly where to find which train to your destination. Don't misunderstand me, it's not a hotel for anyone who is looking for something central that bright and bustling. It's for discerning people who want a tranquil environment amidst the phenomenal storm that is Tokyo. It's a haven when inside and all your needs are catered for. My hotel is my place that needs to be home when on vacation and this one gives one that in abundance. I cannot even begin to describe this place no matter how I try. All I'm saying is that if you value quality, service excellence, convenience, environmentally friendly and green conscious comfort, technology, modern lodgings with old world attention you've arrived at your destination. Saving the best for last is the superb concierge team at this hotel. I cannot find sufficient superlatives to describe what they did for us for the period of a month on this journey. Momoi, you and your staff are the best ever!!! Keep up the fantastic service and we will certainly return soon to this place which felt like home. I can continue to wax lyrically for numerous more paragraphs but prefer that you keep this gem of an hotel top of mind when coming to Tokyo... then understand my rapture!

Also security might be more tight than other hotels. I am a platinum member, so I enjoyed executive lounge, but a variety of breakfast in lounge is a little bit not enough.

Anything you need they will try to cater it. I would like to point out the excellent service and job of the concierge team (I mainly liaise with Ms Kimi). Try pocket concierge and arry japan if you are looking to dine in fancy and famous restaurant, also use tabelog.com for reference.Room Quality: High Tech, Clean, Modern and Comfy. Many other reviews have talk about the room extensively.Facilities: Although I didn't use the gym and swimming pool, I had a look, it was awesome. All new machinery, quiet and well maintain. Big note, they don't let kids swim in the swimming pool.Club Lounge: Not too big, but enough. Has unlimited drinks, alcohol and small snacks. Breakfast: The buffet is simple, there aren't that many varieties but rest assured the quality of the food and ingredient is of utmost quality. I would recommend that you try the Japanese Set, it's delicious and very delightful visually. Dining/Food: Downstairs you will find a complete options of cuisine to eat, all the way from casual to fine dining. Just on top of my head they have: indian, asian, soba, sushi, steak, italian, chinese, sukiyaki, bento, starbucks, oysters and others. We tried most of them casual ones and they are okay/good. Also, about 5 minutes walk is an area call Akasaka, basically there are hundreds of small restaurant in the area, so food-wise no hazzle and you won't run out of option. If you are lazy the hotel has in-room dining service and 2 restaurant, the buffet/mediteranian/casual and the japanese (alacarte, sushi bar and teppan in one restaurant) Location: Perfect, not only that on the same complex you have two supermarket, one runs by Seibu and the other one more of a convenience store (Family Mart), both have its own charm. There is a subway downstairs but we didn't use, we walked mostly to Akasaka-mitsuke (5 mins walk to the nearest entrance) it runs on Ginza and Manouchi lines, which are the two main lines that will connect you to Ginza, Shinjuku, Shibuya and etc. So overall this hotel is perfect. Only a couple of notes, we forgot to turn off our do not disturb sign, so when we return on a saturday evening (17.30) we asked them to clean the room, it seems that the 'actual' housekeeping people left already (maybe its saturday, who knows?) so came about 5-6 people in suits cleaning the place. But definitely the standard is way off, they didn't change many things. Maybe the hotel need to look into this, they should keep the standard and maybe the crew at all times, knowing its a luxury hotel.One more thing, the view is breathtaking.

There were 3 areas that were particularly noteworthy. The gym and spa were gems with all the right equipment and impeccably maintained. The concierge lounge provided snacks and breakfast that could compete with a destination restaurant with a brilliant view of the city.

Eggs dishes were cooked to order, and were quickly delivered to your table from the kitchen.One evening we ate in the Washoku Souten Restaurant at the hotel, we had a range of sushi’s as well as a couple of hot dishes. The food was superb, but the restaurant was quiet and so lacked a little atmosphere. The tall windows in the restaurant did though provide another outstanding view of Tokyo.The hotel is well connected to the Tokyo metro – both Akasaka-Mitsuke and Nagatacho stations are close by, giving you access to various underground lines to give you good access to the whole of Tokyo, and the surrounding areas.Overall this super modern hotel is outstanding. Outstanding staff, fabulous rooms, with great food and drink (including in the Club Lounge).

Also, the hotel is in one of the best neighbourhood of Tokyo with the subway being right at the basement of the building. The breakfast was well assorted with everything we needed.

View (high floor, so you get a fabulous view of Tokyo)3. Technology (you use an ipad to operate the power and curtains)4. Very comfortable bed5. Breakfast - their scrambled eggs are done to perfection! Puts Bill Granger's eggs to shame. :)What I didn't like:1. The censor for the toilet. I jump every time i walk past because it would raise the seat on its own even when you walk past the WC. 2. Their over zealous and perfectionist service. The front desk had forgotten to return me my passport upon checking in at 1am, and they slipped a note under my door asking for me to retrieve it in the morning. Because they are such perfectionists, they were adjusting the note properly on the marble floor of my room from under the door, and i didn't have a clue what that was in the middle night. And since that was my first night and I couldn't really sleep (despite being really tired from a , i freaked out on that sound (that sounded like feet sliding on my floor non-stop).

Many of the 5-star hotels do this, but Shinobu Momoi, Chiaki Kimiwada, and Mai Saki really took care of the multiple requests made and made excellent suggestions to improve my suggestion. Once I got there, it was a perfect stay. At check-in, my SPG status was recognized in addition to the benefits via the AMEX FH package. I loved my room. It was well designed, modern, and perfect as a home away from home. During my stay, I really felt like they were really taking care of me. They made good recommendations to help me optimize the trip. They were so helpful when I went to the wrong restaurant (my fault) that they had booked for me - making calls to both restaurants to resolve the issue. Facilities: Sauna is fantastic. Pool looked great. I wish I had used the spa and will use the next time I'm there. I had dinner at the Teppanyaki restaurant. Good but not the best ever. Drinks at the bar were flawless.

It's on the top floors of a new office complex with stunning views from the public areas and all the rooms. My favorite part of the hotel is the amazing indoor pool and the decent fitness area. The locker room also offered a sauna along with hot and cold plunges.At the base of the building, there is retail on the a couple of levels as is typical in Tokyo. (Coffee lovers rejoice: Within that retail complex there is a Starbucks, a Coffee Bean and a Dean and Deluca). That said the retail space is organized in a way that is anything but intuitive. The hotel is well situated in a nice area within about 200 meters of a subway station. There is apparently a tunnel from the hotel to the subway, but we never actually found it because its unmarked. As I say, you are never as lost as you are in Tokyo.The area is clean and pleasant and seems close to a lot of governmental offices. For most travelers, the more important information about it's locations is that the hotel is within a ten minute walk of lively area of Akasaka where you will find hundreds of restaurants and other entertainment options.The thing I liked least is that while one of the hallmarks of Japan is their super respectful service, I never got any real human warmth from any of the hotel staff. Also, the guidance from the concierge was dicey. On three separate occasions, they recommended restaurants and gave us their names and addresses in Roman letters (i.e., how they would be spelled in English.) But no such words appear on the restaurant. On one trip out the taxi driver circled endlessly through Ginza traffic. After retracing himself three times. He let us out and pointed down a alley. Thirty minutes later, we gave us and ate somewhere else (which was pretty awesome by the way).A quick note for Starwood members, they did not acknowledge my Starwood status. When I specifically asked them about potential upgrades or amenities, they instantly told me no upgrades were available. That may have been true, but there was no reason for the chilly delivery of that message and no excuse for not even quickly looking to see if there was something they could do. I think Starwood loyalists will understand why this is atypical of most Starwood properties.Bottom line is that I would consider staying here again, I'd even recommend it; but there was nothing so compelling about the hotel that would make me yearn to return, either.",Los Angeles,"Ron K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",49,5.0

Asian hotels are known for their incredible service and luxury, but the Prince Gallery took my stay to a new level. As my car from the airport drove up to the hotel, I was quickly greeted by staff members that knew my name (they obviously had pulled up my photo form the internet) and quickly ushered me to the elevator. They said my bags would be brought directly to the room. As I exited the elevator, the manager, Mr. Hetome, greeted me with another staff member. After taking a quick imprint of my credit card and copy of my passport, they ushered me into one of the most beautiful suites I have stayed in while visiting a major city. The suite was on the top floor and had sweeping views of most of Tokyo. In addition to two beautiful bathrooms, there was a livingroom/diningroom along with a huge bedroom with large seating area with floor to ceilings windows with a spectacular view of the city. The suite was probably 2000 square feet that was all well appointed with tastefully decorated furniture and state of the art electronics and sound system. An iPad next to the bed controlled everything, including the 3 lawyers of drapes, the lighting, temperature and audio/visual system. A butler came to my room and assisted me with unpacking as well as folding and pressing my clothing. After I was unpacked, I took a shower in the most spectacular bathroom I have been in. In addition to having an incredible view, the bathroom had a TV and lots of other amenities (brushes, shaver, selection of soaps and creams, etc.). The bathrooms both had the high end, fully electronic Toto toilet. After cleaning up I went down to the Club Lounge. Probably the nicest Club Lounge I have ever been in. In addition to having a super premium liquor selection, there was Moët Champagne for free along with a wonderful selection of food and desserts.

We checked in with a little bit of confusion. As we passed over our passports, they said they couldn't find our reservation. I pulled up my confirmation and they seemed surprised that the hotel was in my name vs my husbands (I also noticed after check in, they changed the room to my husbands name. We had to ask they change it back...I didn't want to loose the points on my account by causing confusion). After we got through that, they recognized my Platinum SPG status right away. They did give us complementary access to the club lounge but were not able to upgrade our room. Our room did have an amazing view though so, I am not sure we cared. The room does have some cool shading features for the bathroom for privacy. The cleaning staff didn't leave a spec of dirt anywhere. The kimono robes were also a pretty cool touch for the hotel to provide. Access to the lounge was amazing. Must get the chef's egg each morning. It is amazing. There is a really great selection for breakfast and tea. We also appreciated an evening cocktail there. There service was also great. The spoke excellent English as I believe they are trying to cater to the business crowd. The hotel is located near the subway station making it really easy to get anywhere you need to go. The lobby bar was a frustration to us. We ordered 2 drinks that were close to $50US dollars...they also charged us a cover charge that was about $20 US dollars. It was removed once we complained but I still couldn't tell why it was so expensive. Because of this, we avoided the restaurants there (we didn't want to go through the efforts of getting charges like this removed). TIP: There are a few other restaurants in the building that speak fluent English and are reasonably priced.Overall, the hotel is beautiful and spotless. While it is pricey, I would stay there again if I was in the area even know it is geared to business travelers.","Chicago, Illinois","andikmyers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",112,4.0

I paid over $600/night (which was a heavily discounted rate) and still breakfast wasn't included nor was a swim in the pool! The swanky bar doesn't have a great view once you're sitting down.

Take the Narita Express (3,020 Yen) to Tokyo Station. Take the Maronouchi line (red) to Akasaka Misui station, just a handful of stops (about 10 minutes, 170 Yen). Take exit 10 D. Upon exiting the station, just cross the river and the hotel is across the street.Overall this hotel is amazing. It is under a year old and feels it. The location is very central, just a few station stops from either Shibuya or Shinjuku. The area around the hotel is more business-oriented, but there are a few streets rowdy with sushi and noodle shops, bars and pizza places just over the bridge. The hotel is in a complex with a Coffee Bean and Dean & Deluca. The lobby of the hotel is on the 36th floor with a bar that looks like it's out of Emerald City in Oz. The rooms are spiffy, relatively spacious for Tokyo and very modern. Most controls in the room are operated by an iPad next to the bed, although there is a luddite-ready box on the other side of the bed that just requires hitting buttons. Room service is also on the iPad. Neato.My room had a huge bath and overhead shower, surrounded by glass that can be muted with the push of a button. The star of the room is the window, which comes with a couch built into the frame, where you can lay and look 35 stories below. Much of my time was spent working on my laptop, just gazing out. The bed was huge and comfortable. The massive TV had a wired sound system that was top notch. The inclusion of an easy-to-bluetooth Bose Soundlink portable speaker in the room gets big points. The wifi is very strong.The staff is beyond helpful, very white-glove service. I made mention that I needed to find an ATM and by the time the elevator had landed on the bottom floor, someone from the hotel was there to direct me to one. English speakers will have no problems at all, very international vibe.I did not get any kind of SPG upgrade. SPG was not even really advertised or mentioned inside the hotel.A couple of downsides: The website doesn't have a contact email if you have any questions in advance (which is why I posted airport directions). The hotel pool is only available for free to club level/suite guests and costs 5,000 Yen to other guests, which is a shame.","Los Angeles, California","idoltraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",73,5.0

The views from the lobby are spectacular. You truly get a sense of the vastness and megapolis that Tokyo truly is. Their is a fragrance in the hotel lobby that makes you feel you have entered a spa. If this is intentional, great job guys.The breakfast room is large and you can walk around to get complete 360 degree views of the city. The breakfast buffet lacks in variety, especially in terms of Japanese food choices. You need to provide more local food options in order for me to feel that I am not having a generic 5 star breakfast. The staff attending guests can also be slightly more attentive and quick to serve guests.The rooms are luxurious and the views from the room are fantastic. The shampoo, body wash and hand cream are all top quality. I would improve the quality of the shaving razor, which is very poor and rough on your skin. The room is brimming with all the latest technology/ toys and the internet is fast. I loved the kimonos provided to sleep in.POOL - This is my biggest complaint and only reason to give the hotel 4 stars. They charge you around US$50 per person to use the swimming pool. I have never before been charged for using a swimming pool at any luxury hotel in the world. I am not writing this here to stop anyone from booking and staying at this property. It is merely to highlight this ridiculous policy to Starwood and the Hotel. Please change this policy.I would like to give a special mention to the Director of Rooms Mr. Keisuke Hitomi.

The style is quite masculine and very modern. The blackout blind is the best I've ever seen (you almost can't tell if it's daytime or not with it closed). My room was facing the Imperial Palace and The Skytree, which I think the hotel considers to be the second best 'side' after the Tokyo Tower view one. All sides seem to have a good view though.Service was mostly excellent, attentive but fairly formal. This hotel feels more 'Japanese' than many of the international chains in Tokyo.A few small-ish nit picks. Checking in with FHR was a bit strange. I made a point of calling Amex beforehand to check that the Deluxe King Room upgraded into a Club one. No mention of FHR benefits or upgrade was made at check in other than being handed the USD 100 food and beverage voucher and so after the attendant offered to show me to my room I asked if any upgrade was available given I had booked through FHR. I was asked to take a seat and after a little while was told I could have a 'nice corner room' if I took twin beds instead of a king. On getting to the room it seemed to be indistinguishable from the standard Deluxe Twin, other than being the room next to the suite on the corner. Perhaps I was upgraded to a Club Twin Room without club access? FHR credit must be used in a single sitting. I used mine for a meal in the main restaurant and whilst the starter (millefeuille of scallops) and pudding (Tiramisu affogato-style) were both wonderful, the main course venison burger was merely OK. I've had better for less than half the price in London. The lack of freshly squeezed orange juice with breakfast was also a bit surprising. Breakfast seems to finish at 10am in the main restaurant even on a Saturday.The Levita bar is physically impressive but I think the drinks still need work. I had the Fuzei and it was really very good, but the other two cocktails I had were just not bad. For somewhere that prices itself as one of the most expensive hotel bars in Tokyo (seems to be a c.15-20% premium to, say, the Andaz rooftop bar) I think they needed to be better.All-in-all then a very good stay, with a little bit of work it could be a contender for one of the very best in Tokyo.

SPG Platinum booked at a high holiday rate, no upgrades. Location - Taxis don't seem to know where this property is. The port cochere is buried deep in a parking garage. Google maps currently shows the construction of the building bc it is so new. We found the easiest way was to access the hotel via Subway as the building is directly connected to the Nanboku line. To access other lines, like the Ginza, Marunochi, and Hanzomon lines, you need to either cross the street or follow the underground signs. We found that even though it was relatively easy (surprisingly especially after all the not to bring a stroller to Japan) this was the only subway station we had trouble with pushing a stroller. It required us to exit the building, walk across the street to take an elevator back underground. Rooms - Excellent, all new technology with full room automation controls. Great shower/bath combo room. High pressure/flow fixtures. Toto Washlet toilet in Water Closet - motion sensor light, and auto open lid. Bathroom amenities included bath salts, body scrub cloths and sponges. Beds were comfortable, and HVAC was seamless/quiet. Best part was full iPad control of all room features, as well as communication to services. We were able to text message housekeeping for requests, concierge, and also front desk. I requested a Humidifier from their drop down list, and 2 people came within 5 min to set it up. Turn down service included macaroons, and 3 staff members at your door. Top notch service. Dining - With SPG-P, we had breakfast every morning at the Club Lounge. Not a large lounge, but well appointed. Small buffet, but excellent selection and quality. The crispy bacon not to be forgotten, as it just melted in your mouth. To order Egg choices are delicious and properly made. Conclusion - I'm not sure if we really maximized our dollar here. We spent a pretty penny, but found ourselves enjoying the city for most of the day. It's comforting to be welcomed back everyday to the hotel, with a staff member greeting you at every corner, all the way from the port cochere up to the 36th floor lobby. The art, the views, the smells, the elevators, all 5 star. However at the $500/nt mark, you begin to wonder if this luxury hotel in an office building is just an oasis, or really a place you can call home for a few days. My wife and I could not decide if we'd come back or not, there are so many other luxury hotels in better locations. However on our last night, we stumbled upon an amazing Yakiniku place in Akasaka (neighborhood across the street) called KINTAN. You MUST get the Sukiyaki - to die for. We will return to Japan just to have that again.","San Francisco, California","lawrencelane</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",27,5.0

However, its low recognition of SPG status does upset me. With my Platinum status as well as using the Suite Night Award together with my record of staying in four different Prince hotels in this trip, they still do not decide to upgrade my room. Frankly, if the hotel could frankly state that upgrade can only be done from a certain type of room, I think it makes me easier to follow. Instead of waiting for months for the SNA, I could know earlier whether I would get the upgrade or if I want to pay more for the designated type of room in order to get a further upgrade.Another thing that disappointed me is the mailing service. I am certain the Concierge lady understands what I am saying here since I was very disturbed by the fact that the Concierge asked me to sign a credit card slip without putting the amount at the time of checking out because they said they do not know the postage until the parcel is sent to the Post Office. For frequent travelers to Japan, we all know that hotels at this level all provide the service of mailing parcels for their customers. The Concierge only need to follow the instruction sheet provided by the Japan Post with indications of size of parcel. Postage to each country is clearly listed according to the sending method and weight. The Post Office will come to the hotel to collect and confirm the postage, but it does not mean nothing is done by the Concierge after I passed the parcel and completed form to the hotel until I checked out. Not even someone told me that the parcel is still unsent until I asked about the postage I should pay. This is quite a surprisingly ridiculous act. I was told on the phone after calling Prince One that I can send down the parcel to the Concierge anytime and they will tell me the postage. Apparently, that's not what happened.There are, however, many good sides about the hotel. The sushi lunch I had in Souten on 24 Dec was greater than great. They serve with great professionalism. The Christmas dinner I had in the Classic House is another pleasant dining experience. The Club Lounge has a marvelous view over Tokyo and the cocktail hours offer enjoyable moments.I do hope the management would pay more attention to foreign customers with good record and loyalty. These are the customers who will repeatedly visit your property, in Japan and in other countries. The Prince Gallery is a gorgeous property and deserves everyone work hard in it to keep up the reputation and serve loyal customers who appreciate your brand that would last for years of patronage.",,Annie C,77,3.0

The lobby is on the 26th floor, and offers a spectacular view of Tokyo. The service is excellent - polite and always at the ready. The room was very impressive - a comfortable bed, huge TV, wonderful bathroom with a fantastic soaking tub and both overhead and directed showers. Counter space in the bathroom was limited (especially if you are traveling as a couple). The real show stopper was the view - almost full floor to ceiling window with a lovely and comfortable window nook to stretch out and read - or gaze at the city below. We loved the view and the way it was presented. Some negatives: the hotel is very sleek and modern, and there are no ""Japan touches"". From the moment you enter the hotel, you could be anywhere in the world - there is nothing to remind you that you are in Japan. Breakfast was not included, which is a bit frustrating at these prices. My main complaint is that we paid more than US $500 per night for a standard room, but to use the hotel pool we would have had to pay an extra US $45 (!), per person, each day.

The Toto toilet was a marvel of engineering and Japanese fastidiousness, and the panoramic views through the single, enormous window in the room was hard to move away from.The shower was huge and contemporary and sleek with plush, push towels, toiletries including lufa sponge, a personal washcloth (yep, a personal washcloth), two bottles of water a day, Nespresso maker, tea kettle, sleek white enameled panelling...I could go on and on, but suffice it to say this is a contemporary jewel in Tokyo's crown.

Views from the spacious windows are impressive. Check-in staff was excellent and helpful in securing a reservation at a desired restaurant close to closing time. Exit the elevator to your floor and you find varied sculptures recessed into the walls in front of you, along with different scents infused into the hallway air. Once in the room you have to use your key to activate the lights. Bedside control panels set varied moods and control most lights individually or in sets. Shower is oversized and its opaque feature is a cool touch whose absence is a turn-off at the many hotels with glass showers facing off to the sleeping area. TV is huge, though using the channel up.down buttons were the only issues I had in my room. Bed was US King or larger, and was insanely comfortable. Lounge offered a full breakfast including eggs to order, smoked salmon, fruits, breads, pastries, etc. More suited to Western than Eastern tastes. While only spent one night, their afternoon spread included more pastries, chocolates, small cakes. And of course a variety of beverages, including sakes, several beers and wine. Spent about an hour at the 31st floor pool/health club, with complimentary access for Platinum SPG/Marriott members, and bathing suits available (for a small fee) if you didn't bring one of your own. Everything again had impressive floor-to-ceiling views of the city. A short walkway from the pool entry has sensors that activate 5 overhead shower heads to walk beneath, providing a warm ""wash-off"" before getting into the pool Pool was comfortably warm, and the oversized spa pool was hot without scalding, and large bench areas all around. The mens locker area had a sauna, a smaller hot tub, and an accompaying cold tub, as well as traditional asian bathing benches and western showers. All had nice toiletry products.All in all, a wonderful one-night stay. Close proximity to 2 subways make for easy transport, and large gardens nearby.

Follow the directions and the hotel is easy to find from the correct subway exit. The huge windows in lobby area had awesome views. And the lobby wasn't super busy and crowded so it seemed more peaceful. Same great views upon entering guestroom. Was lucky, I suppose, not having overcasting days during my stay. Loved the window seat but best of all was the blackout shade. I wouldn't have woken up without my alarm clock, the room was so dark and bed so comfy. And the windows were really pretty quiet (heard couple emergency vehicles) and heard nothing from neighbors or from hallway. Gym is fairly standard, has the pulley machine thing in a private training studio. Pool fee waived for certain room categories and SPG status. My main complaint is there is so much technology in the room (iPad controls too) that there's a gazillion things glowing at night. The light control panel, the thermostat, light switch at door entry and bathroom. Would be nice if there was a low glow setting or cover. I ended up covering stuff up with pillows and other light blocking objects. Need key for elevator and to enter guest floors. Keep the toilet room door closed or it senses motion from the sink area and keeps waking up. Dinner was fairly quiet, nice night views over the city. Enjoyed a leisurely two-hour breakfast and wasn't rushed at all.

When we were leaving our hotel to go sight seeing, a staff member rushed to us with 2 umbrellas saying it might rain. Really appreciate this attention to detail by the staff. The Bar looks fantastic and has exceptional views, but the green wall lighting somehow makes you feel uneasy. Even though we liked this bar, we wanted to leave after a drink because it did not feel relaxing. Felt we would hear the slot machines ringing any moment. One thing I did not like at this hotel was that they wanted to charge you $45 per person per day to use their pool.

A rightful comparison for this hotel is actually the Palace Hotel.

I've never seen such great desserts anywhere and they are available virtually all afternoon in the lounge! The pool and gym are both beautiful and no one else was using the facilities while I was using them. Breakfast was also super, they have a Japanese set menu my wife chose and although I hate food photos (and the people who take them) I have to admit her Japanese set breakfast was photo-worthy. I attached a photo of the view from our room, which virtually every room shares. So what's the negative side? Well, the price. It's very high but in Japan you get what you pay for. After several weeks traveling in Japan, I can say there are no ""deals"" to be had here! If you have the cash (or points) and are coming to Tokyo, give this place a try - you'd have to be insane (or a serious nitpicker) to not love it.
