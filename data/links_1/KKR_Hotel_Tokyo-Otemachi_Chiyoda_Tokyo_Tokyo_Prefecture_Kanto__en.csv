Granted you have the entrance to Takebashi Metro station right outside the door, but there are no lifts from the underground - only long flights of stairs, so it will be difficult with heavy luggage.Also, the same category of single rooms have 2 types - one at the long side of the building with much bigger space, and one more type at the shorter side of the building with much lesser space. As for the toilet in the rooms - some rooms are more updated, compared to the others, so the washlet toilets are much better, whereas the older ones aren't as good. Other than that, I think it's a fairly standard business hotel -nothing fancy. Also, if you book a twin room, make sure to write TWIN there - they gave me a double bed for my twin room, which made for some laughs when my friend and I checked in.","Singapore, Singapore","sodiumion</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",12,3.0

Small 'nook' for hanging clothes with no door, a nice desk to work on with a mirror in front, full-length mirror by the entrance door. 2 electric sockets in the bathroom and 2 more by the desk. A minifridge in a cabinet attached to the desk. Green and brown tea (1 each) every day with the hot pot for boiling water. The TV is maybe 42 inches (didn't measure) but I didn't use it because all I found were Japanese shows. Might have others but couldn't read the remote buttons as they were in Japanese and I was busy so no time to watch. If you want a Japanese breakfast, you need to buy the vouchers. Coffee/tea, salad, beans and edamame, tomatoes and some egg and franks, fried potatoes. BEST was the croissants with really nice blueberry conserve with tons of whole blueberries inside. A separate Japanese table with more local favourites. Entrance to the underground train right out the front door and a block walk underground to the train. Limited food options for lunch or dinner but within 5 or 6 blocks, many more options if you turn LEFT out the front door. Front desk staff do not all speak English but the would summon someone who did speak it fairly well.

We had a one day conference at the hotel and we had both lunch and a more luxurious dinner in the Japanese restaurant. The food and service was of good quality. When travelling, you will probably arrive at Tokyo Station. You can easily walk to the hotel. The distance is about 1.5 km one way. The iPhone map works well and will give you good instructions. If you have spare time, I recommend a walk in the imperial garden. If you are not so keen on hotel restaurants, I recommend a short walk towards north when leaving the hotel. There you will find a variety of smaller, not expensive, restaurants, including McDonald’s. I enjoyed a splendid tempura set meal an evening in one of these restaurants.

This metro connects me to all the parts of the city through the various connecting metro and Japan Railway (JR) lines. To come here from the Narita lnternational Airport, l took the Airport Limosine Bus that cost ¥3,100 to Palace Hotel, a ten minute walk along the walking path that surrounds the lmperial Palace Garden moat. It is a 15/20 minute walk to the Tokyo Station, the main transportation hub of Tokyo. The reception was excellent and most of them could understand English. They were helpful and gave me a good map and showed me how to negotiate the metro which is quite daunting if you are not familar. The single room that l booked was spacious and clean with a fridge n tv. Some of the rooms overlook the lmperial Palace Gardens. The rooms are from the 13 to 15th floor and all have some view of the Palace. The only setback is that they do not have a safe in the room. Breakfast spread was fairly average; a mixture of japanese and western. Overall l love this hotel although l have to take the metro to the various tourist attractions. A 7-11 is located a mere 2 minutes walk north. If you are looking for a decent hotel with a metro station that connects you to all parts of Tokyo, this is it.

(A Chinese and a French restaurant are things the Japanese traveler might appreciate..)It was good to actually feel that I was in a foreign country with an unfamiliar range of food and drink and English rarely heard or seen. Most of the staff are not fluent in English, but reception can always help you.There is a shopping center very close by (but easily overlooked - it is quite discreet on the outside) which has a whole range of international eating places (including some western ones) if you want a change from the hotel food, or if there is too much of a queue at lunchtime.

You get all the information of this hotel from their website, just search: access and read PDF of room and bed sizes and hotel services from there.Overall a good hotel to stay in Tokyo and best hotel I´ve stayed in Tokyo so far (ryokan stay earlier).Pros:+ We were checked in at 13:00, which was really nice touch after long haul flight.

Take a taxi from Tokyo station with luggage.- Bathroom´s room height lower than in room. - Loud TV voice from next room came strangely through window in two evenings, but ended soon.- If hotel´d filled with Americans having jet lag and loud conversations in a hallway, that will be heard into room.

The place was certainly serviceable, and probably 3.5 stars would be more accurate, but a few minor problems keep me from bumping it up to the elusive four star ""very good"" category.The location of the hotel is definitely a plus. It is located right near the Imperial Palace, and indeed from the restaurant on the 12th floor you can look right into the gardens. Definitely a nice view, and a great place to go walking/jogging in the morning. Located right beneath the hotel is the Tokyo Subway (Tozai line) so that you can easily hop on the metro and ride around town. There is a food court type area located around the hotel, and it's walking distance from nice restaurants (and karaoke, if that's your thing).The staff was friendly and helpful. In another review someone complained about the English, but I (as someone who speaks no Japanese) was always able to find an employee to help me. The concierge staff was particularly pleasant, helping with everything from locating an ATM to finding out information on a baseball game to changing money.Breakfast at the Fuyo restaurant was nice, although very repetitive. I think a little variety in the selection would have been nice, although I suppose they don't generally anticipate guests staying there for eight days at a time. Nonetheless, if you have extended business to do at the hotel, keep that in mind.I found rooms to be somewhat small, although certainly workable. I would not, however, want to spend a lot of time inside. The beds were pretty hard; I normally like a more rigid mattress, but this was too much even for me.One major problem was the lack of good Wifi, particularly on the 15th floor. For the first part of my trip (I checked out for two nights then checked back in) I was on the top floor and shut out of Wifi. I had to go all the way down to the lobby in order to get a signal, and that one was unsecured. My colleagues below me on the 14th floor had a signal. When I checked back in and was given a room on the 13th, I had a signal. It appears, therefore, that the 15th floor is a dead zone. This hotel seems to cater more as a business hotel (given room size and what-not, I'd struggle to use this as a tourist point) and therefore reliable Wifi seems extremely important. I think the hotel really needs to address this issue.Overall, I did enjoy my stay here. Staff was nice, location pretty good, and food okay (while repetitive). However, after a few nights, you begin to pick up on a bunch of things that could be better.","Ellicott City, Maryland","saintangus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ellicott City, Maryland</strong>",25,3.0

It's a good place to relax, meet other people/tourists, and learn more on Japan's royal family. Another good thing with Japan is that they have a very organized public transportation system, e.g train, from my limited experience that is.

The rooms (we stayed in two different rooms) smelled of stale cigarette smoke. The signs posted asking guests not to smoke in bed were telling, as well as ominous. The air conditioning was the kind that only blows hot air, and the combination alarm clock/nightstand seemed to have come out of a '50s B sci-fi film. Kitschy yes, but ultimately about as useful as a chunk of wood. The saving grace of the hotel had to be the staff. Very professional, very polite, and seemingly willing to go out of their way to offer help, tips, and suggestions for the jet-lagged Westerner.","Chapel Hill, NC","JW-xplore</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chapel Hill, NC</strong>",7,2.0
