Luxurious facilities as expected, especially with the pool and the main lobby area. Staff are really incredible which is consistent with most hotels in Japan.

Usually all Ritz Carltons are luxurious but this one tops the Ritz Carltons in Osaka and Singapore that I previously stayed in. The rooms are 52m big with a huge bathroom and very luxuriously appointed. I stayed there for 6 nights but did not manage to use any of the hotel facilities as I spent all my free time exploring Tokyo. The hotel is next to Tokyo Midtown shopping mall and close to Roppongi and Akasaka where there are a lot of restaurants.

She was particularly helpful in making us aware of a national holiday which, had we not known, would have seen us travel to a place of interest that would have been deserted.

Love the hotel. The common areas, the spectacular views and stunning floral arrangements in the lobby were all next level. The food and service for breakfast was incredible friendly and the food was delicious. The bar service was excellent. So many little extra touches for making a traveller travelling alone feel so comfortable. I highly recommend the hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again. The room was spacious clean and very well appointed. The gym was great as well. Unfortunately I did not get a chance to use the spa but definitely will on my next visit. I spent a lot of time deliberating where to stay and I am delighted with my decision. The location and attached shopping centre with cold rainy weather was a huge plus!

The logic being that our jet-lagged brains needed something familiar and cushy to crash at before taking on Japan. So, as expected, the staff is on-point. Exceptional service from the moment you walk into the hotel. The room was fairly spacious and the views are stunning (I’d imagine) from any room as the hotel doesn’t start until the 45th floor in the building and is the tallest for a few blocks. The room was as expected from Ritz-Carlton. Lots of extras.Nepresso machine. Kettle for tea and tea bags. Lots of items in the bathroom in case you forgot something. Our room had a separate tub and shower. Breakfast was great but pricey. $100+ for two people even with a discounted rate. We did it once and then hit a few spots in the ‘mall’ in the building for the other days. Lots of amenities as far as spas and pools but we missed that. Concierge service was helpful and friendly.

It is beautiful. We visited earlier in the day so we could see whether It was worth going there later. It was beautiful, and it certainly seemed worth it. They walked us around and showed us all the facilities, and mentioned the steam room, sauna, etc. They never once said anything about use of the facilities costing extra money, even for hotel guests. For the record, there is no mention of an extra cost even on their spa menu that I grabbed, or on the website under the spa menu. But when we showed up to use it at the end of the day, they very casually handed us a sheet of paper letting us know there was a $30 charge per person. Now granted, I have no problem with the hotel with us upfront about additional spot charges. If they are upfront, that is up to you to decide whether or not you want to pay it. But for a hotel where the rooms are in the $500s at a minimum, and upwards $1000, it is extremely strange to nickel and dime on use of a steam room/sauna, without even being transparent about it. After feeling irritated and doing a lot of searching, I finally found mention of the additional charge on the website for the gym facilities. I also noticed a lot of other people have commented on this as a complaint on review sites. I hope they fix this little detail, so that they can truly become one of the best hotels in Tokyo!","New York City, New York","Dragonlady15</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",96,4.0

You're thinking it's a long trip, an expensive one, you want everything to be perfect, don't want to get all the way there and wish you were staying elsewhere, etc. Stop the hand-wringing and torment, and go with the Ritz Tokyo. I just completed a 4-night stay at the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo with my family. An absolutely incredible property, amazing staff, and in an ideal location whether you prefer taxis, subways, or walking. Pool, fitness center, and sauna area is awesome. Views cannot be beat - you'll either look across the city at Mount Fuji, the Sky Tree, and/or the Tokyo Tower. Our room was large by any standard, bathroom was perfect, and closet space was exactly what we needed. The views from the room are breathtaking. Everyone from the hotel was fantastic to speak and work with, however I need to single out David (Davey) in the bar, Kitano, Yumi, Saeka, Mathieu, and Omar from the front desk and concierge area, and especially Jimmy in the Towers restaurant and Nakamura from the Lobby Lounge restaurant. On two different nights, Nakamura provided an incredible experience (carrying the girls' dessert to our room one night, and on another setting up a small table for my wife and me at the window, when we mentioned it was ""date night""). I usually avoid hotel meals as a rule, however do not miss the breakfast in the Towers Restaurant, or the wasabi snack mix in the bar. The hotel is connected to Roppongi Station, which allows truly easy access to anywhere in Tokyo. Great ramen and udon shops are right around the corner, as is shopping, sightseeing, Starbucks, etc. At about 1,800 nights in hotels and counting, these may have been my favorite 4 nights yet. In all those nights, this is also the first review I've ever written - it's just that good. Amazing place.",,SneakerGeeks,2,5.0

I’m a Titanium member and travel 80% of the year staying at numerous Bonvoy properties around the world, this was definitely a first encounter where a hotel charging $1k a night would have the balls to tell their most loyal guests in early evening hey sorry I don’t have a room for you. The check in staff took her time to explain the titanium benefits; she took out a piece of paper that says 4pm ‘guaranteed’ late check out but at the same time told me with a straight face that the room needs to be returned by 12 noon the following day without any hesitation. The so called Titanium perks are either 1x Apple 1x Orange or some lame discount on breakfasts. Great location, but very poorly trained staff who don’t understand how to handle situations and communicate in a way international guests can understand.

Tokyo was our last stop, and we were totally enamored by the city. Our visit was made even more special by our decision to stay at the Ritz Carlton Tokyo! After a long day of travel by train, we arrived to check in at the Club Lounge on the 53rd floor with the soothing sound of live harp music. Since it was raining, the Lounge view was literally in the clouds, so we literally felt like we had arrived in a piece of heaven! We were greeted promptly by the hotel's GM. Mr. Masato Kominami, who offered his personal assistance from the moment of booking through our arrival and stay! Yoshikazu Katori, Front of House Manager, also greeted us and handled the details of our booking and gracious upgrade to an amazing suite on the 48th floor with panoramic views of the Tokyo skyline. Shortly after getting to our room, they sent up welcome amenities of fruit and water, and the young lady who delivered the items was simply incredible! She told us she was interning as part of her hospitality career training, and she is already an incredible asset. I am so sorry I can not recall her name, but she was distraught that our arrival to the incredible view from our room was obstructed by the clouds! We told her it was fine since we were staying several days, but she wanted us to experience the view from the moment of arrival. We went to dinner later on and returned to the room to find she had delivered a personal hand written card along with several personal photographs she had previously taken of the view so we would know what we had to look forward to the next day! This was an amazing gesture, one we will never forget!Others were equally personable and kind, especially Dennis in the Club Lounge. He took great time to ask us about our plans and offered his personal advice. We especially appreciated his advice to be the first in line for the tickets we had purchased for the DesignLab's Borderless exhibit at the Mori Digital Art Museum! What an amazing experience, and if we had not been first in line when they opened at 10 am, we would have been waiting in line for hours to get in the door! In addition, he and his colleagues made excellent drinks at the Club Lounge bar, and their generous hospitality was greatly appreciated.All in all, the Ritz Tokyo is an exceptional property driven by exceptional service and timeless elegance. I hear they have plans to update some of the classic interior elements that will only enhance the experience even more, and we look forward to returning to see the continued improvements. We only experienced one small flaw our entire stay, and that was at the main lobby bar. Even though we had Club Lounge access with the incredible views on the 53rd floor, we were excited to experience the views from the infamous and dramatic lobby bar. Understandably, the venue was constantly busy, and seating at the main bar was usually scarce. However, the lovely lobby and lounge offered ample seating with some great live music and a wonderful setting. We checked each night and came back after dinner on Sunday night after 10pm to see two seats open at the main bar. We were excited and went over to have a seat and a nightcap. A waiter quickly greeted us and informed us the two seats were not available but did not explain why. He offered us a seat at a nearby hightop, so we reluctantly took it with hopes of moving to the bar. We had our nightcap, and no one ever took the two open seats at the bar. Also, other seats opened up, and we were never offered to relocate. In fact, we even had to ask to have the waiter come back over to order a second nightcap, and again, no offer to move to the bar even though we had requested that from the beginning. Compared to the warmth and highly attentive service from the entire team during our stay, his attitude was totally out of place and confusing, so we just considered it to be an anomaly for whatever reason. Otherwise, a flawless and luxurious stay, and we can't thank Mr. Kominami and his team enough for their gracious hospitality and attentive service!","Canton, Georgia","CantonGaBill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canton, Georgia</strong>",94,5.0

This is a beautiful glamorous hotel. The staff were impeccable and made us instantly welcome. Our rooms were lovely with fantastic views over the Imperial Palace and new Olympic Stadium. The night before we checked in we had watched the rugby in our daughter’s room with brilliant room service. There were nice chocolates as a welcome treat and a great turn down service. The bathrooms are superb. We were celebrating a special birthday so had booked a traditional Kaiseiki meal in the Japanese rests. We started in style in the bar which embodies old style luxury with wonderful cocktails, nice music and fantastic city views. For my husband the best thing was being able to smoke his cigar.The only negative was the meal and restaurant service. It started off ok with 5 of us ordering one of the set meals,and my husband ordering a la carte because he has seafood allergies. Our server seemed to have difficulties understanding our order although it was a set meal. After 1 1/2 hours we had only received 2 tiny courses, and my husband had not yet had any food. We don’t know whether a Kaiseki meal is supposed to be this slow or whether there were problems. We finally had to ask to bring food more quickly which made things a bit better. We had breakfast in the restaurant which was very nice, although my husband would have preferred a few more western options. The egg menu is particularly good.The hotel staff were very helpful at arranging luggage forwarding to our final destination.It is a fantastic hotel and I would recommend it for a special occasion.","Teddington, United Kingdom","AMTLondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Teddington, United Kingdom</strong>",168,5.0

As expected, the hotel service was flawless. Rooms were decent size considering you are in a metro city, and with the hotel rooms being 40th floor and higher, you are bound to get incredible views. Unfortunately, even as platinum members, we did not receive free breakfast. It was a bit odd b/c they offered us free breakfast on the last day b/c they weren't as booked on that day. Not sure why that matters for breakfast, but that's okay. We were happy to pay for it as the breakfast was really good. the best part is they offer a waffle croissant - it's exactly as it sounds and it was yummm! We had dinner at azure 45 one of the nights. Being a Michelin star restaurant, we knew it would be expensive. Not surprisingly, they were incredibly flexible with dietary needs. We are both vegetarians so all courses were made vegetarian for us. With us celebrating our anniversary, they added a celebration message to our last course. They gave us a table with a view of the tokyo Eiffel tower, it was very romantic and exactly what I was hoping for. Concerige was extremely helpful as always. However, Arakawa/Dan were amazing. Always helpful and went above and beyond in ensuring we had everything we needed or help provide suggestions where we were unsure. Additionally, Cristina - host at the breakfast restaurant was amazing. She remembered our names after the first morning and would greet us by our names. While that may be common, it's not everyday you meet people who memorize your name after one meeting. We certainly didn't get the same treatment from other employees at the hotel, which is why we still remember Christina. The negatives - it's crazy expensive. Obviously the hotel rooms are expensive considering it's Ritz and Tokyo. But even the drinks. The cheapest glass of whiskey I saw on the menu was close to $40. Half bottle of champagne was over $100. On the last day, I asked the hotel for a weight scale b/c we wanted to weigh our bangs to ensure they were within the limit. I would think a hotel like the Ritz would have weight scales available, but instead they sent up a food weight scale, which was half broken and required the hotel employee to hold one side up while we placed our bags on them. The location is excellent as well, walking distance (5 min) from Roppongi where you will find many bars and restaurants. It is also a 5 min walk to the train station so that you can connect to larger train stations for other areas of tokyo. Would def. recommend again if you are willing to pay the cost (we used marriott points).","Chicago, Illinois","581anishs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",139,4.0

Service is a hallmark here. We arrived as a party of 3 from the train station and the friendly porter quickly gathered our luggage and a host directed us up to the reception floor. The main lobby/reception on the 45th floor is lovely and spectacular. The host walked us to the reception desk and waited with us until the reception was available to check us in. Our 6-yr old Little Bun was given personal attention and whisked over to an adjacent “kid’s check-in” area where she was entertained with a check-in process and given a quest to complete during our stay. The real check-in was done efficiently and then the host took us up to our room and showed us the features of the room. Our luggage arrived quickly afterwards. For my Titianium Elite status, the hotel was not able to upgrade my room but they kindly offered us complimentary full breakfast for our 5 nights stay in lieu of an upgrade. So we had a regular deluxe king room with a rollaway bed for Lil Bun. The rollaway bed carried a charge of roughly $90 per night. The room was about 450 sq ft (42 sq meters) and the rollaway bed took away most of the free open space so the room felt tight. But this is Tokyo, so 450 sq ft even crowded by furnishings is quite a luxury. The king bed was wonderful - firm mattress, soft linens, and lofty big pillows. The rollaway bed was a twin adult size with equal quality linens. The hotel offered a child’s size set pf pajamas for Lil Bun to wear to sleep. And we had adult pajamas too. Being in summer, we did make use of the A/C system and it worked well and most importantly the gentle hum of the blowing cool air was not noticeable. The excellent bathroom had 2 sinks, separate bathtub and walk-in shower and separately enclosed Toto toilet. A small complaint would be that the walk-in shower is not large enough for a truly luxurious experience, roughly only 4 ft x 3 ft. We had a beautiful view from our windows that we enjoyed every night.The breakfast was spectacular and we came to appreciate what a wonderful treat it was every morning. The quality and breadth of the food was fantastic. There was a perfect mix of local Japanese food and western food. You had the ability to get made-to-order breakfast foods as well as the large buffet selections laid out across the sides of the restaurant floor. Service at breakfast was friendly and prompt.We also made use of the delightful pool which was a well-maintained and very clean facility. It was a joy to jump into the mildly heated water and relax after a day out & about. We absolutely loved our initial 5 nights at thr RC Tokyo.Unfortunately we departed for about a week and then came back again for 2 more nights and it was a bit of a let-down on our last 2 nights. This would be the reason I cannot give the hotel a 5-star ranking. When we checked in again, there was no acknowledgement that we had recently stayed at the hotel. It didn’t bother me but I would have thought the hotel pays careful attention to returning loyal customers. At check-in, again the hotel could not offer an upgrade for my Titanium Elite status but this time the hotel did not offer any substitute goodwill gesture. We were taken to our room and to our slight disappointment, it was smaller than the regular deluxe that we had during our previous stay. We paid for a rollaway bed again which really crowded up the space. We asked for the same child’s size pajamas for Lil Bun to wear but the hostess told us they did not have any available. So it was a very inconsistent experience from the high standards that were established previously during our first visit. We did enjoy the marvelous breakfast again. It brings a smile to my face when I think fondly about the spectacular RC Tokyo breakfasts.","New York, NY","NewYorker03</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",66,4.0

We enjoyed our stay.We choose Ritz Carlton because it take care of our kid by providing Kid amenities and little games for him. The room is spacious which is not common in Tokyo. The location is fine. You can go to many other places by transferring in Ginza station.

Tokyo was our first stop and this was my favorite hotel of the entire trip. The rooms are a nice size for Japan and they are thoughtfully laid out with plenty of storage, closet space, dressers, and a very spacious bathroom. The bathroom is wonderful with two separate sinks with plenty of room for two people to get ready and lots of storage and even a drawer to keep makeup and personal items (why are there never drawers in hotel bathrooms?) Also, the view from all the rooms is fantastic. Even with some jet-lag, opening up the view gets you excited to explore the city and it's stunning at night as well. Another great feature of this hotel is the location. It's close enough to a metro station but almost feels like you are in a suburban area of the city with green space and parks, felt like a retreat in the middle of Tokyo. The service is also top notch as you would expect. There are nice restaurants within walking distance and it's connected to a mall so it really has everything you need. I have two tiny complaints about this hotel. 1. The bar in the lobby is stunning with beautiful views and great drinks but they allow smoking, which is a bummer. Usually it's not bad but you can smell it when you walk in, typical in Japan. 2. There aren't very many breakfast options around. We ate at the hotel, which was yummy but quite expensive. The mall doesn't open until 11am and there really aren't many places around that open for breakfast. We found a French Cafe in the Tokyo Midtown Center called Le Pain Quotidien, which was one of the only places open in the immediate area. Overall the hotel is expensive but worth every penny, I would definitely stay here again.

He not only gave us directions, he walked with us to the mall and made sure we found the machine! This is a great hotel.

Therefore, I decided to take advantage of the extra reward night before the new redemption rate takes effect. We are now here with my wife's family for a 5 days vacation. We are disappointed to the room assignment. I have explained our needs to hotel two weeks in advance. It is like this, we have two rooms (one under my name and the other under my wife's) and put us close by. If possible, we want rooms with Tokyo tower view. As a Titanium member, I feel the request was extremely reasonable. However, our rooms were not close at all. We were separated in Different Floors and NO Tokyo towers view in any room. I understand there might be requesting from other guests. But come on, I still see three or more rooms available at the moment on Marriott system and nobody bothers to work something out for us?We spent 3 nights in Kyoto RC earlier this month for the Sakura season and we had wonderful experience since the time we stepped in there.

We ordered room service since it was late and most restaurants and shops at the Galleria Midtown Tokyo was closed. Our food arrived on time as promised. We had breakfast at the Towers on the 45th floor and was met daily at the reception by Ms Cecilia Yamashina & Ms Kana who greeted us each morning with a smile, as they led us to our table & took our initial orders during our entire 6-day stay. The breakfast buffet had a good and sumptuous international selection and it also includes a special menu to choose from. My personal favourite on the menu was the waffle croissant. The best! I miss it. The rooms at the Ritz Carlton are pretty big for Tokyo standards. All rooms come with spectacular views considering that it starts on the 46th floor. Our room was always kept very clean and well made up.

It deserves 5 stars, but on our one night stay we had several service hiccups in the executive club, which we didn’t expect. Looking at other reviews, I think we just hit unlucky, so I wouldn’t want to put anyone off staying here, but on the other hand, the service wasn’t what we expected. We arrived at the hotel and were greeted and taken up to reception. We then had to wait to go to the exec club to check in. We were taken to another lift then asked to get out of it as they needed to check our access to that level, bit embarrassing, but no big deal. At the exec club, we were welcomed and seated and offered a drink, views are fab, so all was great, except that 45 minutes later, nobody had made any attempt to check us in. It was 5.30 well after check in time, so room should have been ready. Again, no big deal, we were tired after travelling all day, but my husband went to enquire and we had another drink and then nothing happened for 30 minutes until my husband finally went up to the desk and said we wanted to go the room very firmly. 10/15 minutes later check in was sorted. Bit of a shame as the tea and club were lovely, but we just assumed they were busy or forgotten us. We ate at the tempura restaurant which was really enjoyable and the service there was excellent. Back at the club, staff member apologised for the delay in check in, which was really sweet and we asked for early breakfast and checkout and a taxi to be ordered as we had an early flight. Next morning we were given a coffee and croissant in the room as requested, but we had to call 3 times for help with the bags and then we waited 15 minutes for a taxi and only got one as he dropped someone else off at the hotel. None of these were big issues but we were just surprised as usually service at Ritz is flawless. Nevertheless we would stay again, as a lovely property with great views.","Worcester, United Kingdom","stellaear</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Worcester, United Kingdom</strong>",24,4.0

For example, I was trying to find out where I could buy a similar blow dryer (hair) to the ones in the rooms (they are GREAT blowdryers, btw) and I got a list of a couple of places, close to the hotel, where I could buy one. Service that goes ‘above and beyond’ is always a wonderful treat and I thank the staff for that!In the club lounge, the breakfast waffles are to die for. You must ask the lady who makes the omelets and she will take care of you. Such a kind woman. Thank you!Since I used Bonvoy points for the room, I paid to upgrade to the club level (20k yen + tax =~23k yen for an upgrade/per night). Using points to upgrade wasn’t allowed.The food offering in the lounge was good, not great. My son and I always compare ‘club level’ offerings to the JW in Cancun, which did an exceptional job of their meal/food offerings in the lounge.

We stayed a total of 5 nights using points and they are worth every single point. I contemplated between Tokyo Marriott (with breakfast and lounge access perks) and RC (without those perks), no regrets in choosing the latter. Location wise, it is walk-able to 3 metro lines (covered by Tokyo Metro Pass, which we purchased from Roppongi Hills) but there is quite some walking distance averaging 10 minutes. At the 46th floor, there is the swimming pool, common Jacuzzi and heat experience. On the last few days when our travel schedule is not too packed, I wanted to try the heat experience and I was told there is around 3000 yen required as top up (I think it is complementary for some room types). Well, I was glad I had read the benefits entitled to me beforehand that as a Marriott Plat Premier (now Titanium), there is complementary heat experience, which I reminded the reception of. Heated Jacuzzi (at 40 degrees Celsius), cold bath, sauna and shower stalls are included. The experience is separated by gender and is Japanese style (naked and no tattoos).

For our honeymoon, my husband and I decided to go to Tokyo and to split our time between the Prince Gallery Tokyo and the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo, two of the best hotels SPG-Mariott have in the citey. While the Prince Gallery was an absolute delight, the service and attitude at the Ritz was some of the worst I have ever experienced, leading us to check out on the day we arrived and switch hotels.Firstly, when we arrived, we were told there are no upgrades available, though upgrades at check-in (based on availability) are a basic benefit of Platinum membership. I had booked the hotel online earlier that same day and there had been plenty of suites available at the time online. When I double checked, the associate at the check-in desk changed tracks and said they did have suites, but none were ready at the time. I said we were happy to wait, since for once, unlike when I'm on business trips, on my honeymoon I actually planned to spend time in the hotel and would've loved for it to be extra special. After some waiting, she agreed to upgrade us to an Executive Suite. So far, so good.Later in the evening, we wanted to grab a snack and drink at the Club Lounge before heading into the city but were told that Platinum membership doesn't get access to the Club Lounge at the Ritz. Of all the SPG hotels I had stayed at, this was a first. While normally I wouldn't care, but since my husband and I are both vegetarians who had been having a hard time finding good vegetarian options in Tokyo, we had been keen to have some options at the Club Lounge, which is why we had chosen to stay at an SPG-Mariott hotel. Explaining this to the manager, we requested access to the Lounge for just the one evening but were flatly denied. What was worse was the tone of the manager who told us we were being unreasonable and that he had already done us a huge ""favor"" by upgrading us at check-in, and that if he gave us access to the Club Lounge, it might bother their Club Level guests since the Lounge might get ""too crowded"". Unless I was being completely unreasonable to expect some pampering on my honeymoon at a hotel where I had been a Platinum member for years, this tone especially left a really bad taste, and we decided to check out and move back to the Prince Gallery, where the helpfulness of the staff and their effort to make our honeymoon stay special and memorable had been next-level.Very disappointed by the attitude of the manager - and would not recommend any Platinum members to stay at the Ritz - your loyalty status, and any special occasions mean zilch here!",,DayTrip649453,5,1.0

It is a beautiful property, with some great staff, but the service is inconsistent and disappointing in many respects, which fall far below the usual Ritz Carlton standards.To start with the pros: - good location (connects directly to public transport and shops);- elegant interior design (both public areas and the room) which gives a classical European impression; and- good breakfast staff (two managers at the entrance were really welcoming and a member of staff at the breakfast area voluntarily offered to provide take away coffee, in anticipation, as she noted that I was in a rush).The cons:- Not much loyalty recognition (I was told by the front desk staff that Marriott Gold Elite members are not eligible for upgrades. Only platinum or above are eligible. This was quite surprising. This should be made clear on the website.).- Disappointing front desk service and welcome (it was my first time at the property but the front desk staff did not offer to take me to the room. Nobody showed us around the room and the property. You also get “lemon water” as you try to check in - rather unglamorous.- Lack of interest in guest service standards - at checkout, I was not asked how my stay was.- Cleaning Service was rather poor (I took a picture - there were unhoovered corners of the room throughout our stay).- Terrible lounge staff - was seated in the lounge area for breakfast, as there was no space in the breakfast area - the staff in the lounge was the polar opposite of the breakfast restaurant staff - cold, avoiding eye contact, unattentive, leaving dishes piling up and specifically having to ask for dishes to be taken away - really unpleasant experience.- Disappointing departure service - I asked for a cab and have my bags loaded - the lady at the bell desk asked us to wait outside the building - it was cold - if there was some common sense, maybe the guests should have been called after the bags had been loaded? - Breakfast quality - I wanted to order some eggs royale - after trying to explain what it was, I eventually just settled on eggs Benedict, which is not a big deal, but the quality was also not that great (in terms of taste and presentation) - i don’t want to compare food to Europe but just to illustrate the point, somebody should try the egg dishes at the Ritz Carlton Vienna. What I had comes nowhere near the expected European quality - better off I think just having breakfast at the shops in the shopping mall below.There are other comparable hotels in Tokyo and if you want the highest quality service, my view is that it would be worth considering them.","London, United Kingdom","PDYK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",3,2.0

I recommend enjoying the ambience of the beautiful bar/high tea ☕️ although if you don’t like seafood or raw fish you will not find the high tea to your liking. It’s not western style and you probably shouldn’t expect it to be since you’re in Japan. They do have other western food on the menu though like French fries Overall a very relaxing and stress free experience. Beautiful room, impeccably clean, enormous bathroom, beautiful view of the city too. This is an expensive hotel but I think you get what you pay for in terms of service and facilities.","Brisbane, Australia","Ali R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",21,5.0

I’ll grant there are other luxury hotels in the city, but the graciousness and hospitality of the staff set this property head and shoulders above the others. I stayed here with my two children, ages 10 and 13, last April. Prior to arrival, I corresponded with Ms. Reika to inquire about a room that would offer the best views and comfort for a 10-day stay. (Both Tokyo Tower and Mt. Fuji views are stunning, so no reason to be disappointed either way.) Not only did Ms. Reika describe our room options in detail, she even emailed pictures, floor plan layouts, and a bullet-list of pros and cons for each, including very specific details such as building architecture which may allow other rooms to see into the windows. Incredibly helpful and patient! The room she recommended was perfect, spacious, and very comfortable. Upon arrival, the kids were delighted with room decorations of balloons, gifts, and a warm welcome. As Platinum Marriott members, we accustomed to complimentary club access, but this is not offered here. Don’t let this discourage you. We chose to pay for Club access, which included personalized concierge services and five food presentations a day—totally worthwhile and highly recommended. The quality is far above and beyond the club lounges that are offered gratis to elite members. We got to know many of the Club Concierge and staff, who go out of their way to make your stay special—they are truly all wonderful. Ms. Erina was particularly kind and has a natural gift with children. She offered wonderful recommendations based on our interests, and left delightful notes and treats for the kids outside our door. Upon our departure, Ms. Reika, Ms. Erina, Ms. Sayaka, and Ms. Fumie (also from the Club) surprised us by meeting us as our bags were being loaded to say goodbye and presented my children’s favorite treats (which they remembered and packed to go) and gifts. And here’s a first in our travel experience: Ms. Erina surprised us with a lovely handmade scrapbook of our family’s trip including pictures of the places we described in our travels each day! Such a wonderful and over-the-top thoughtful gift. I do not think our experience at the Ritz would have been the same without the Club Lounge. It’s a splurge, but you won’t regret it. Particularly if you are traveling with a family or group, the lounge is a wonderful place to gather--and this is not always easy to find in Tokyo, where space is at a premium and many restaurants are best suited to solo diners or pairs. The views are spectacular, the constant supply of food and drinks delicious, and the service unparalleled. They’ll make you feel like royalty.

These would be my dear (human friends) Yuka-san, Eiko-san and Kumi-san.My husband and I stayed at the Ritz Carlton Tokyo from 21 March to 24 March . This was the second time I was staying at this resplendent hotel. INdeed it is the epitome of luxury and beauty.In any case, the Ritz NEVER FAILED TO IMPRESS. If you are there for the first time, you will be floored by the elegance of the décor, the classic furnishings and the beautiful chandeliers and bespoke rooms and architecture. Even the bathrooms and the toiletries shout GOOD TASTE! You just can't go wrong if you choose to stay at the Ritz. Every single corner drips with luxury.I am a stickler for cleanliness and I love to stay in luxurious surroundings so Ritz is an absolute must for me. As far as service is concerned, you really can't ask for anything more. We took the room plus breakfast package. On the first morning that we had breakfast at the Towers Restaurant, Mr Leon Cates, the Assistant Manager of Towers Restaurant approached our table and asked us how we found the buffet spread that morning. Being the loquacious person that I am, I told him that I found the French Toast ""to die for"". Leon went on to tell me that that was his favourite food item in the spread too. He explained that it was made of ""brioche"" and briefly told me how the French Toast was prepared every morning. I was sold on it! Leon was very attentive to us and very friendly. Unwittingly I leaked out that we were there to celebrate my birthday and to meet up with my wonderful Japanese friends. Unbeknownst to me,Leon then surreptitiously asked his chef to bake a birthday cake for me. On my birthday morning, when my husband and I went to the Restaurant for dinner, Leon surprised me with a beautiful (and yummy) birthday cake (""Arabica Sphere"") which was also extra-terrestrial !!! It is made of coffee sphere, milk chocolate and hazelnut with a biscuity base. WOW !!!I had never tasted anything quite like this. As for location, it is a stone's throw to the malls. On one of the mornings my husband and I walked to Midtown and we were so delighted to see the cherry blossoms in full bloom. (You would probably know that mid March is a bit early for cherry blossoms.) . My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at this wonderful property.It was definitely made much more special by Mr Leon Cates!

She extends an early check-in as our flight will arrive at 9 am in the morning.Prior to arrival got a very welcoming email from hotel manager, MR Masato asking what can be enhanced to make our stay as comfortable as it can be, all our trips to Tokyo will be for shopping only, not much asked, only my wife forget to bring her hair straightener which is provided as we check-in.Upon arrival, was greeted by very welcoming concierge team, they are as responsive as one can be, once, I even saw they insist to carry someone bag, that's the utmost customer service, small line in check-in counter at LV45, oh man, the lobby is very impressive, you can feel all the luxury and staffs attention, after a few minutes waiting, upon seeing our reservation, Reception staffs greet and welcome us well, 2nd time in my life I got check-in in the room, very welcoming lady staff guide us to room, and again, insist to carry my wife cabin bag, no upgrade was given, but standard room at RC Tokyo already very big(52m), she explain thoroughly every aspect of the room, and likely want to show off the view, which is quite stunning, but that morning a lot haze, only the third day view is very clear and we can see mount Fuji at far, which is very relaxing to look at, all the amenities at the room was explained very well.Even standard room is very large, bathroom with 2 sinks for him and her, with well equipt with luxury amenities, VERY comfortable bathrobe and towel, anything you can ask for in the hotel, hair straightener that I asked earlier was already there.Rooms feel luxurious with a large window facing the city, we were assigned to 51st floor facing Ebisu area and in the clear day, you can see mount Fuji perfectly. A bucket of ice and evening turndown is provided every day. Nespresso machine also provided with 3 capsules every day, still wonder wether can ask for more, but I didn't consume as much as usual, so not asking for a refill.No BF/lounge/upgrade was extended, its expected at all RC, also no luck this time, :D This hotel is situated at Tokyo Midtown Shopping mall (Akasaka Area), with a great surrounding, Roppongi Station (Hibiya and Oedo Line) is just a walk away, with Nogizaka Station (Chiyoda Line)just minutes by walking. To my surprise many shopping/eatery that is my favourite is all in here,start from Ichiran just beside Tokyo Midtown, Jojoen Yakiniku just opposite, Donki just crossing the road, will pass Coco curry Ichibanya, Gyukatsu Motomura just open beside Ichiran, it's AN perfect surrounding, with #foursquarefind, there is Imakatsu nearby. There best of it all Konami building is just beside, oh boy, it brings a lot of childhood memories, there's a slang if you know Konami, likely your childhood is awesome.5 nights seem not enough, sadly we have to leave for another plan, as hi tier member, 4 pm check out was guaranteed, we only ask for 2 pm check out, check out is smooth with not much trouble, we did ask to send 2 large shopping box to overseas which handled perfectly, small trouble for sending 2 large luggage to HND airport, at first it was accepted, but later, very fast response staffs have no confidence that it will be arriving in timely manner, explain very politely and concerned about our luggage, we accept that explanation and just carry the luggage with us.Final words, its very worth to spend the points, lovely stays, will come back for sure if have the chance. :D","Medan, Indonesia","quinjoe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Medan, Indonesia</strong>",102,5.0

Worth every damn point.Hotels in Japan are notoriously small. Teeny tiny.I mean you barely have a place to put your suitcase in the floor small. And the bathrooms are the same kind of teeny tiny.But the ritz...man.From beginning to end I felt like royalty.On check in, our room was not ready so they offered us complimentary drinks while we waited.Can I tell you about the nuts they gave us to snack on while we had our free beverages? Free beverages served in the lobby on the 45th floor where we had a breathtaking view of tokyo?They were two kinds of nuts. One was assorted japanese nuts. ( I say japanese because they were those nuts that have this really yummy crunchy coating I cant explain or cant say uve had anywhere else) And the other kind...which was my personal favorite: a mix of wasabi and curry flavored nuts. Again I say nuts but I feel like they were these amazing cookies shaped to look and taste like nuts because they had a much more luxurious mouthfeel than ordinary nuts. I wanted seconds...which we got...then I wanted thirds...but my friend said no.When our room was ready, they almost all but begged to take all our bags..they already took away our luggage but I guess my purse looked too heavy for the elevator ride to our floor.You guys...the rooms were gigantic and so was the bathroom...even by vegas hotel standards...and I know we got the smallest room there.And they had nespresso and already boiled water and already filled bucket of ice and these little japanese cookies and...I just can’t.I really wanted to cry tears of joy my entire stay....and then tears of sadness when it came time to leave.And guess what guys...we got to check out at 1:30 pm instead of the usual 10am checkout all other hotels in Japan impose.Highly recommend staying at the Ritz in Japan.I might not recommend spending a ton of miney for a hotel anywhere else because usually a few hundred a night will get you a pretty nice hotel...but hotels in Tokyo are tiny to begin with...even after paying over a hundred a night...I can almost justify shelling out a few more hundos because this place is fabulous.I didn’t take enough pictures...for which I apologize.

Checkin smooth and greeted by the manager and brought to our room by a kimono clad greeter. For Spg gold with Amex plat given a club floor room on the 52nd floor but no lounge access which was fine. Gorgeous view and service was stellar as expected. Sadly the pool was closed for maintenance during our stay - if I had the kids with us and this mattered I could have called ahead to check. Complimentary free drink at the bar was a nice touch. Very convenient being attached to Tokyo Midtown centre and the subway.

I knew it would be a good stay when the bellman addressed me by my name as I climbed out of the cab. A concierge popped out the door and took me to the 45th floor lobby for check- in. With a quick and very friendly check- in, I was given Room 4738, a very spacious room with corner views of the fairly nearby Tokyo Tower, the Imperial Palace grounds and Tokyo Skytree off in the distance. With a full moon rising over Odaiba, it made for a spectacular view. You can even see out to the expressway crossing Saitama. Rooms on the other side of the hotel can see Shinjuku and on a clear day, Mount Fuji. With guest rooms going from the 46th to the 53rd floors, you can’t get a bad view.The bathroom amenities are top- notch, befitting the Ritz standard. The tub and shower are separate and the toilet is in its own room in the bathroom. The shower has a wall- mounted wand and a rain shower. There are two sinks. There are lots of thick towels - if you use all the towels provided, you are having a very wet day.There is a USB charging port at the desk and two at bedside. The desk also has three JP/US standard mains outlets plus one multi- standard mains outlet at desk level. The bed linens were top- shelf, and the room was very quiet the whole time.There is a walk- in closet with motion sensor lighting, gobs of space and enough hangers for a long stay.Breakfast was excellent. The coffee was great and the fresh fruits, juices and pastries were also excellent. Service was very good, and I suspect that breakfast is a proving / pay your dues ground for waiters who want to break into the lunch and dinner restaurants there; there was a clear difference in the seniority and capability of the waitstaff at breakfast vs. dinner.The staff overall are very eager to help, and you notice nice touches throughout. The ice bucket was kept freshly stocked. I showered before dinner, and while I was out the staff turned down the bed and totally cleaned the bathroom, re- stocking Q-Tips, mouthwash, towels, soap and so on – you would think you had just checked- in.The Ritz is well- situated near Roppongi and all its advantages. It’s near the Chiyoda metro line (Nogizaka Station) and just steps from the Toei Oedo and Hibiya metro lines (Roppongi Station). From the gates of the Toei Oedo line, it is a 3 minute walk to the doors of the hotel, all covered, all escalators – so even if it’s pouring rain and you have baggage, you can beat the very slow taxi ride to midtown and do it in relative comfort.The hotel is on top of the Midtown building, which brings many restaurants and conveniences along with it. So under one roof, there are about 50 different restaurants, bars and coffee shops. There is a convenience store (conbini), a drugstore, a bookstore, a pharmacy and all kinds of other shops and in addition, a high- end shopping galleria.

He was Carlton.” -Uncle PhilIf you’ve read any of the other reviews here you’ll have heard the Ritz Tokyo is phenomenal. And so it is. As others have noted, service is as good as it gets. Much respect to the entire staff, and particularly the two ladies (did not get their names, silly me) who took care of me at the Club Lounge Oct 16 and 17. Hopefully the hotel representative that reads these reviews can track them down and give them two thumbs up from me (5327). Make no mistake - this is hotel is a slam dunk, home run, whatever else you want to call it. The real deal. But no review would be complete without some critical notes: despite the impeccable service and staff, I found Club Lounge food and drink offerings middling. They are consistent with other Ritz properties, but for having read that the Tokyo location was of a higher breed, I did expect a little more especially at this price point.And that’s it! That’s the only negative thing I have to say. If you stay, be sure to check out the spa and gym facilities. The pool and heat experience are for me a highlight. You’ll get the most out of your stay if you have Platinum or higher status with Marriott, as you’ll have some cool perks like complimentary access to the “heat experience.” Great hotel.",,GoldenCrone,25,5.0

It was nice to always go back to our quiet hotel at night nestled in midtown.I must admit, that we originally booked a different hotel for our trip and later decided to spend the additional money for the Ritz through our travel agent. I am so glad we did as the Ritz has set the bar very high and we cannot imagine staying anywhere else.

We can both say that without any doubt in our mind this was the best way to end our honeymoon. We travel quiet a bit and have never experienced such impeccable service and attention to detail.The concierge was incredibly helpful in planning our stay. I spoke with them prior to our arrival and mentioned a few things we liked and wanted to do on our honeymoon, they sent over photos of the top restaurants with descriptions and prices. The rooms were incredible, with the most killer view of all of Tokyo. Extremely clean and surprisingly good size for being in Tokyo! Location was perfect, close to a lot of great restaurants and shopping mall. Breakfast was great, had good variety of food. I loved the fresh juice bar. Azure 45 is the Michelin star restaurant inside the Ritz. Not too many words can describe this restaurant or do it justice. Wowwowow is pretty much the best that comes to mind when I think of it. I’ll write a separate review for this restaurant, but definitely one of the best meals we have had till this day.As an example of the attention to detail we experienced on our stay, I had mentioned we love sushi prior to our arrival and waiting for us in the room on arrival was two sushi key chains (amongst other fabulous surprises) with a sentimental hand written card which we have kept and smile every time we look at it. They also knew I loved cherry blossoms and on our last night while we were eating dinner at their Michelin star restaurant (Azure 45), they surprised us with a personalized hand made and written card with dried pressed cherry blossom flowers and a cherry blossom drink, which put us to tears it was so sweet. If I’m not mistaken, I believe the person who made all this happen name was Sayaka from guest recognition. Sayaka really was the most helpful and amazing person and is truly an asset to the Ritz-Carleton name. She is the main reason our stay was as memorable as it was. It is not a matter of if, but rather when we visit Tokyo again, we plan on only staying at the Ritz-Carlton.

We were very tired after our flight delay and our flight and the 1.5 hr drive from Narita to the Ritz-Carlton. We got out of the van, our luggage was whisked away and then we were escorted by a hotel staff member to the 45th floor of the building, which is where the lobby was located. Then we were greeted by the manager, Alex, who escorted us to our rooms. They were very large connecting rooms on the 48th floor, one room was a corner room, so you had expansive views of the the Tokyo skyline and you could see both the Tokyo Skytree and the Tokyo tower in the distance. The other adjacent room was a smaller room, but still very nice. The overall effect of the two connecting rooms was that of a large expansive suite with great views of Tokyo. It was nice enough that we really didn't feel a need to visit the Tokyo Skytree and deal with the crowds there. We were checked in our room and our bags promptly came up. There were some complimentary small mochi balls that were delicious and we slept like babies. Breakfast the next morning was also excellent. Buffet-style with a good choice of Japanese/Asian and Western items. You could really stuff yourself silly. Of course there was a choice of eggs cooked to your order included in the buffet.We found the hotel to be pretty convenient once we figured out the Tokyo subway system. The Roppongi Metro station is pretty close and most importantly, in the really severe August heat, reachable by going through the attached and air-conditioned Midtown Tokyo mall complex located at the bottom of the hotel/office building. You don't have to get blasted by the severe heat outside before reaching the subway. The connection to the mall/office complex wasn't all that obvious. As you head out towards the front door at first floor, the doormen will see you exit the hotel elevators and ask if you want a taxi, we would politely decline and just turn into a corridor still inside the building to an exit into the mall. We did not see a sign telling us ""this way to Tokyo Midtown"". We found the attached Tokyo Midtown mall to be an additional benefit. There are all sorts of stores and if you're not going to eat at the Michelin-starred restaurant all the time, all sorts of more reasonably priced eateries in the mall. There are also nice dessert and bakery shops in the mall. In the upper levels of the mall, in the Garden Court, there are some more formal and pricier restaurants, some that we tried. There was also a bookstore, although I didn't check carefully, but it only seemed to contain books and material in Japanese. The main benefit, I thought was the presence of a Preece supermarket in the mall (and also a 7-11). As usual when you travel, you always forget to pack things, like sunscreen or dental floss and various small knickknacks that make traveling more pleasant. It's nice that you can just zip down the elevator and pick up some little necessities and some good snacks and reasonably priced fruit, and zip up the elevator and take them back to your room.  The fitness center and pool located on the 46th floor are nice. Nice views but fairly generic. What stood out to us about the hotel was the level of attention and the small personal touches. The staff seemed to recognize us by sight, although I wonder if a family traveling with 3 children made us stick out somewhat. Since my wife had made the reservation and she did not change her name when we married, the staff always called me by my wife's last name, as Mr. (Insert Wife's Last Name). That always made my kids giggle. I didn't have the heart to correct them. Every morning as we headed out with our backpacks and water, we would encounter the concierge staff. They would ask us what our plans were and my kids would tell them. Invariably it was shopping or sightseeing or once, my oldest child had this hankering for some exotic dessert she saw on YouTube or something and wanted to track that dessert down. The concierge staff would give us maps and tips for getting there (taxi, subway etc) and send us off. Some of the staff we got to know and told us little bits of their own personal history. It was a nice touch. But what was really amazing was at the end of the day after slogging through sight seeing/eating/shopping and the heat, we would would find, slipped under one of our room doors, a handwritten note from the concierge that we spoke to that morning, addressing the children, that wished us that we had a good time seeing the sites/stores that we visited and had a good day. In some cases, ie. when we went to the main Pokemon store (we took a cab, too many subway stops and transfers) the note contained Pokemon stickers stuck to the note along with the text. This was just simply unspeakably awesome. My kids would look forward to getting one of these after we returned to our rooms. In response, my older children, the day before we planned to leave the hotel, made it a point to visit a stationery store and find nice cards and pens to write thank you notes to the concierges who wrote them and assisted us. They've never done that at any hotel that we've stayed in before. The morning that we were leaving for Mt. Fuji, a helpful bellman (who because of his perfect English, we found out was from Hawaii) came up and picked up all of our luggage and forwarded to the next hotel, as we were overnighting in one of the climbing huts. Every single piece showed up at the next hotel and was waiting for us without a hitch. I think all of us were really sad to leave the hotel when we moved on to the next stop on our itinerary.",West Coast,"Snowbeardude</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Coast</strong>",87,5.0

Additionally they made me feel I would get upgrades with my Platinum status for subsequent nights. I agreed to get two rooms. Heck they didn’t even give me connecting rooms knowing very well that was incredibly important to me since I was traveling with four kids.Upon arrival, I was instantly told no can do - no upgrades. Right off the bat, I felt duped. They messed up on my room charge on over 3 occasions. Each time you talk to a different person who contradicts what the previous person says. They took over an hour to even bring me the bill. Finally, agreed that they shouldn’t have charged me for the breakfasts too!Additionally, their breakfast is lame, a simple request for ranch dressing can’t even be honored.Nothing special about this hotel, boring *indoor* swimming pool.

The room had amazing views of Tokyo from the 53rd floor. The bathroom large and had some really great amenities. The king bed was perfect and had some great sheets. In our opinion the club lounge was worth the extra cost. High quality food and drinks all day long with the absolute best views of Tokyo. If staying in the club lounge, Towers restaurant, is also an option for breakfast. It is one of, if not, the best hotel breakfasts we have ever had. The staff was absolutely superb! Even before we arrived the concierge assisted us with multiple important things. My girlfriend is allergic to tree nuts and the concierge printed a card with a warning of her allergy written in Japanese! It was so helpful when we went to Japanese speaking restaurants. Also, they were able to get me a reservation at the famous Sukiyabashi Jiro Ginza! Best sushi of our lives! We wouldn’t have been able to make it with out the help of the Ritz Carlton concierge.

First impressions: very popular property. The lobby restaurant and bar were packed when we checked in. They had a ton of attentive staff to take care of us.We had a gorgeous Tokyo tower city view, on a floor in the 50s. I would recommend the city view over the Mt Fuji view especially since it is lovely both during the day and the evening. We were greeted with macarons and other snacks throughout the stay. The location of the venue itself is in Roppongi, an upscale area with tons of delicious restaurants. It is very conveniently located in the Midtown Tokyo mall, as well as steps away to the subway line. Since the per-night rate is quite high though, the clientele is mainly people who can actually afford the per-night rate and taxi everywhere, haha. As noted, we just used our SPG/Marriott points. Such amazing service here. We were helped out by the concierge Risako - she really went over the top to end our last few days in Japan. She helped us reserve at Ushigoro (a delicious Japanese yakiniku place that everyone should try), and also gave recommendations for the area. We also got a reservation at Sukiyabashi Jiro through the hotel, which is the famous sushi omakase owned by Jiro's son, such an incredible experience that is all thanks to the Ritz for helping us book (you need to reserve 1 month in advance).Amenities: gym is pretty standard, larger than regular hotel gyms. Pool is standard, hot tub has a city view, but not with Tokyo Tower. If you get a chance, you should enter the change rooms where they provide spa services. The female change rooms has a tub with a Tokyo Tower view. The male change rooms has a non-Tokyo Tower city view.We stayed at the Kyoto Ritz Carlton earlier in the trip and overall still prefer the Tokyo property because of its long tenure, so the concierge and service was so genuine and over the top.

Quick note for Marriott Rewards members - after doing some research, it didn't sound like Marriott Platinum members would be automatically upgraded to the club lounge if you booked a regular room - you would have to first book the club level, in order to get upgraded from there. I'm so glad we went with the club level - it made the stay even better. And we did indeed get upgraded to a suite on the club level upon arrival.I cannot say enough nice things about the staff. Upon arrival, we had a lovely note with several chocolates waiting for us. I had also been emailing with the concierge for several weeks ahead of our stay to book various restaurant reservations and activities - they were so kind and helpful! During our stay, there was a slight miscommunication about one of our activity locations - not a big deal at all. But when the lead concierge heard, she immediately arranged for a BMW car service to take us to the planned activity the next day, and we received a full size bottle of special sake as well.

First off, the main lobby was located on the 45th floor with an expansive lobby lounge with views to die for. Check in was seamless as the staff was quite fluent in English. Our room with 2 double beds was huge and very comfortable for my family of 4. The bathroom had double vanities, a separate walk in shower and a water closet with the ever popular fancy automated toilet seat, and a large soaking tub. We were situated on the 49th floor floor with expansive views of the Mori Tower and of Mt Fuji on a very clear day. Twice daily maid service was routine. With views like these, we did not even waste money on the Skytree ($40pp) for their views. We stopped by the pool and exercise facilities, and it was impressive. We were only able to dine at the Towers for the breakfast buffet (the croissant waffles were awesome), as there were no available reservations for Azure 45 or for Hinokizaka Japanese offerings the 4 days we were there. But no matter as there were plenty of food choices as hotel sat right on top of Tokyo Midtown and the Roppongi area had numerous restaurant options. Plentiful shopping was also within walking distance, or there were two subway stations nearby that took us all over Tokyo. (A Suica card is a must!) The only one complaint was that the Lobby Lounge allowed smoking at night, but the piano player and singer were excellent.

By our second morning at the Ritz, Okabe had remembered all of our orders from our first morning alone: camomile tea for my mum, coffee for my dad, and an earl grey for me. I was taking herbal medicine on this trip, and asked for a cup of hot water to dissolve the medicine in after I’d finished my breakfast on our first morning. Again by the second morning of our stay, Okabe brought a cup of hot water for me to take my medicine, before I even had to ask. On top of her incredibly thoughtful and top-notch service, Okabe is exceedingly warm and friendly, taking time out of her busy breakfast shift to chat and making us feel so welcome and at home at the Ritz. On our last morning in Tokyo, she even gave us these sweet origami presents which she had handfolded herself!

Due to our flight arriving at 1:30am and our expected arrival at the hotel 3am, we expected some possible issues, but there were none. We received an email from the hotel manager about 5 days before our arrival asking if there was anything they could do for us as well as asking for our arrival information. That being sent, there were no complications what so ever. The doorman was expecting our arrival as well as Hirohito Yoshikado, the Assistant Night Manager, personally received us at the front desk, and after as few standard details, himself showed us to our room. He was extremely professional and we both felt that he was genuinely concerned with our satisfaction during our visit. Once we adjusted to the time change we went out to explore Tokyo. With the help of the concierge desk we learned about how to use the transit system and well as used their suggestions on which gardens to visit as well as get us reservations to the Imperial Palace (which is open only 2 days a year...just by chance we were there during one of those two days). Our room was always cleaned to exceed our expectations. As an example of the service we received, because of the cherry blossom trees blooming (and probably some other vegetation pollinating) I was in the need of some antihistamine. I had a fun and quite entertaining, but unsuccessful conversation with a local Japanese pharmacist trying to find some over the counter medication. Returning to the hotel we met with Reika Ohsawa, the Guest Relation Supervisor, explained what we needed and she wrote down in Japanese what we needed. We returned to the pharmacy, handed him a note, and after a big smile and a nod, the pharmacist gave me what I originally tried to ask for. As a follow-up, she remembered our request for help and asked if there was any questions about dosage.Basically this is the best place my wife and I have ever stayed at in all of our international travels. Our simple requests for help were eagerly accepted which made this trip so much less stressful than it could of been. We know that In order for this exceptional service to happen requires an entire team effort, much more than the two names we mentioned in this review, so please express our gratitude to the entire staff. Because of this experience, this will not be a one time ""bucket list"" visit.

The views from the room are amazing, and the bathroom is super luxurious- 3 separate stalls for bath, toilet, and shower. The room is also very large.Two issues:1. It's kind of annoying to get to the hotel- the building it's in has a lot of shops/amenities, but also as a result, requires you to navigate through a lot of different areas to get to your room. Takes at least 7minutes from entering the building, I'd say. And you have to take an elevator to the lobby, then get out and board a separate elevator to the rooms. Not something huge, but if you're going to be in and out a lot, it gets annoying. 2. This one really struck me as ridiculous. We went to the pool/sauna hoping to enjoy them, and found that, one, you are required to wear a swim cap in the pool at all times, which feels silly and overly-cautious. We chose not to go in forthat reason. And second, the sauna is NOT included in the price of your room, as any reasonable person would expect at a hotel of this caliber. Nope, you have to pay about 3,000 Yen per person per DAY to use a dinky little sauna. My local YMCA doesn't even charge for that.

The view from the hotel is great, Tokyo looks amazing from up high. What set this hotel apart from the rest was the quality of the staff, they went above and beyond in taking care of us, naturally focusing on making our 5-year old daughter happy.

Now they have Oedo-line along with Ginza-line, it is just so convinent getting around (of course easy access to Taxi too) Lobby is at the 45th floor and rooms starts from 47th & up. Needless to say the view from the room is fabulous. You get to see entire Tokyo at once. Their B/F buffet is the must-try. (Compare to US, the price was reasonable I thought. Less than $40 per person). There is alao Galleria mall on the 1st floor and below, tons of high-end stores and restaurants. Food wasnt that expensive to my suprise. Impeccable service and concierge.

Despite the many luxury properties in Tokyo, I have yet to find a favorite one like in other cities. I decided to try the Ritz Carlton Tokyo again after hearing of praises especially for the new club lounge in the travel forum. My competent travel agent was also able to secure me a good upgrade to suite so I decided to try. ArrivalI arrived by taxi after my trip to Kyoto where I also stayed at the Ritz Carlton. On arrival at around 2PM, I was escorted to the front desk for check-in. Seeing there was a queue and my suite comes with club lounge access, I request to check-in at the club lounge thinking that it should be faster. The bell boy then escort me to the club lounge for check-in.The hotel’s club lounge has since undergo an extensive renovation and refurbishment. It is now much more spacious and luxurious, and with more amenities. I was sat down on a table and given a drink. Then I waited for the staff to actually check me in and gave me the room keys. That didn’t happened. I waited for 10 mins before I got impatient and asked a staff to check-me in. Again I was told to wait at my seat. Another 10 mins passed, still no one came. I went to the reception desk only to be told my room wasn’t ready! That’s annoying. They should have told me upfront so that I could have gone somewhere instead of waiting pointlessly. Apparently, the staff thought since the room wasn’t ready, I should just relax in the lounge. I left the hotel and came back at 4PM for check-in. The club manager apologize for the delay and personally escorted me to my Executive Suite. The Executive SuiteThe suite is spacious, and have two wall to ceiling windows that really showcase the panoramic view of Tokyo. Few hotels have views as good as the Ritz Carlton, the other being the Mandarin Oriental. The first thing I noticed is that the layout of the suite is very strange. It’s the usual suite with a living room, a bedroom and en-suite bathroom. What’s weird is that the bedroom actually come before the living room on entering. Suite and Rooms in the Ritz Carlton has been refurbished and looks much nicer than in the past. The bathroom regretably still remain the same and has not been refurbished.Room amenities were adequate with a coffee machine, fast wifi, large LCD TV in both living room and bedroom and a very comfortable bed. The airconditioning was noisy when I checked-in but the hotel maintenance staff fixed it quickly. Water pressure in the bathroom is adequate but not great. The common areas and locationThe hotel common areas are starting to show it’s age, looks rather old, and is actually due for a refreshening up. There were a few restaurants in the hotel. I tried the Teppanyaki restaurant and it’s excellent with good service and great food. Highly recommended. Morning breakfast served at the Tower restaurant was excellent as well. The Club Lounge has some nice food serving and very nice in-house champagne. Other than that, I don’t actually find it very nice, especially when compared to the spacious club lounge at the Ritz Carlton Hong Kong. The tables were too close together for comfort and the food serving was not very extensive. The breakfast served at the club lounge was poor, lacking variety but one has the option of having breakfast at the main restaurant. Nevertheless, it is still a relaxing place to have a quick drink or two. The hotel is located at the Tokyo Midtown, which is a shopping complex with some nice restaurants, and provide direct access to the excellent Tokyo Subway through an underground passage. The negative is that it’s quite a long walk to the subway entrance Overall, the location is noticeably less interesting compared to Ginza and Roppongi Hills and the surrounding area. ServiceService at the hotel is uniformerly excellent. Other than the initial hiccups during check-in, it was polite and attentive. There were many foreign staff in the hotel as well, perhaps to help with communication issues since local Japanese staff don’t speak good English. The Club Lounge Manager Mr Katori was excellent and he ensured most of my request were well taken care of. Service recovery was also excellent. Once a staff wrongly sent me an email which was meant for another guest. When she realized her mistake, she immediately apologized but then followed up with a free bottle of champagne to my room. Service at the Teppanyaki restaurant where I had my dinner one of the nights was excellent. The meal was expensive of course but it’s delicious and well presented and service was very attentive. ConclusionNot much to fault here really, whether service wise or the hard product. My only gripe was I don’t really the location. It stop short of mind blowing greatness but that is probably too much to ask nowadays. A very good rating of 4.5 out of 5. I would not mind to return.",JAKARTA,"BENLEE123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>JAKARTA</strong>",775,4.0

The room is spacious with every amenity you can think of. We were greeted by a young man, Alex, dressed in a beautifully custom suit and ever so personable greeting us and bringing us up to our room.The room has auto sheers and black out drapes, hot water kettle, Nespresso, tea bags, 3 Nespresso pods, bottled wTer, and your choice of daily newspaper. There is plenty of wine glasses, corkscrew, tea cups, and even a welcoming plate of fruit and mochis.They use Frette linens so it is very silky but each bed has only 1 pillow so we had to request for more pillowsa. Surprising, they do not use duvets but instead wool blanket sandwiched in a duvet cover which is unusual for this caliber of hotel.The hotel is in a great location, imho, because it at the MidTown shopping center below the hotel is a huge shopping mall, Galleria, with 4 floors of shops, a vast array of different restaurants, Starbucks, 7/11, and a huge supermarket, Precce, which has very reasonable high end deli food items and ready made foods as well as sushi and meats.we purchased all our alcohol at Precce along with some finger foods and enjoyed it in our room as Happy Hour. We did not need to go out as I was feeling a little under the weather so being able to enjoy a glass of wine and champagne in the comfort of our own room was a real plus.The swimming pool and jacuzzi are complimentary for guests as well as the extensive gym. The Heat Experience room is additional charge. The pool is lovely and the changing room is extremely clean and luxurious. I enjoyed the 20meter pool during our stay for sure.The Ritz Carlton is all about the guest, the individual, as they make you feel very valued as a guest regardless paying $2000 a night or using your Marriott points as a Marriott member. No matter where you are at this hotel, every staff member is ready to greet and get the elevator for you.

Ritz Carlton in Osaka is classic style, while in Tokyo it is contemporary.I checked in at club lounge on 53/F. The club lounge provides snacks and good view of Tokyo Tower during its operation hours until 10pm. The room I was staying, like the one I stayed in last time here at Ritz Carlton was quite dark. I even need a torch to look at the temperature control panel. I turned on the big TV but muted the sound so that the room looks brighter. The view is, however, great. In good weather, one can see as far as Yokohama. The bed is firm enough for me. Drapes and sheer is electric controlled. Cleaning staff worked very hard to make the room sparkling clean.Toiletries are abundant. Bath salt for bubble bath is provided and the tube has an excellent view of Tokyo. However, the quality of the shower gel, shampoo and body lotion and their dispenser are disappointed and do not live up to the Ritz name.The breakfast restaurant was under renovation at that time so breakfast was arranged in the lobby restaurant.

I loved that everything about this hotel shouted “in the middle of the city” as it resides literally atop the fun shopping and dining area Tokyo Midtown and the Roppongi subway station. Everything from the checkin to getting assigned the desirable room to getting your luggage and checking out the facilities was a breeze with the eager staff members very much readily available to help. My only unenthusiastic encounter was with the hostesses at the Lobby Lounge who seemed very occupied and unable to help much when asked to see the cafe menu. The rooms felt imperialistic, modern and most importantly spacious with a great skyline view of Tokyo. The bed was comfortable as usual at Ritz properties and I especially appreciated the spacious bathroom very ready for a hot bath decked with a TV. Honestly though, I think what distinguished this property among others was The Club Level experience which I had heard great things about and really was also nothing short of fabulous. The wide range of food options for breakfast - from omelets to porridge to green smoothies - along with great coffee drinks and an excellent atmosphere really made this upgrade with it. Plus, this was the first Club Lounge where they had a very prompt and proper three-tiered afternoon tea set served impressively in silverware for all their guests. Just that afternoon tea experience alone (which we would have done anyway either at Ritz or Aman or Mandarian) made the club level upgrade extra worth it for us. I did notice that this hotel seem to support a lot of non-hotel guest business (I.e. extensive spa, gym memberships, meetings, etc.) which probably serves the affluent in the city and it was interesting observing and running into those individuals most who were dressed up very formally, compared to my casual and comfortable attire for traveling. All in all, I can guarantee the quality of the service, the food and the overall experience of this hotel really exceeding the Ritz standard and that by coming and staying here, you’ll get a glimpse of the very classy and convenient city living (ie. elevator ride straight to the underway to subway station, shops, restaurants, 5 Min walk to Joel Robouchon bakery, etc).

My only complaint about the lounge would be the lack of interest/help from the club level concierge team. They seemed to sit at the front and weren't terribly helpful/attentive when we asked for help with tours. Otherwise the club lounge truly was a tremendous value. We also enjoyed the pool also with amazing views of the Tokyo skyline. I will note that cloth swim caps are required in the pool and provided by the pool attendants. The pool attendants also went out of their way with a kind gesture to our children who noticed small ducks (think Oriental Trading) in their spa display.

I’ve spent some time with my wife for January 2018 in celebrating our anniversary – we’ve been to Sanya Marriott, Ritz Carlton Hong Kong and Ritz Carlton Tokyo. Needless to say, Ritz Carlton is undoubtedly the best – particularly the unparalleled service standard. I stayed with Peninsular Tokyo and Prince Gallery Tokyo on my previous business trips to Japan – I believe Ritz Carlton Tokyo is still the best out of these three. RC Tokyo is everything you expect from the chain but the service, in particular, goes above and beyond the industry standards. The RC service is impeccable the moment you received the welcoming email from Mao of the guest relations team who looked after every single details of what we need. The moment she was aware that we were here to celebrate our anniversary she replied she would give my wife a surprise. We communicated numerous times in regards to every detailed question and every time Mao replied to my email instantly despite sometimes it was very late night in Japan. I knew the service team from RC would never let every customer down – and I was right: due to some reasons we arrived in very late night, however, Kana warmly greeted to us and the handsome boy Mark personally escort us to our room for personalised check in. The moment we stepped into the room, I was deeply impressed by the decoration of the room and all the anniversary atmosphere suddenly came up and my wife can’t help but almost crying. Despite we were being late, the SPA team still waited for my wife’s visit and provided her with the best SPA experience in Japan (as said by my wife). She asked me if RC Tokyo treated every female customer as a queen – I told her that’s exactly what the flagship level of Hospitality Service Standard should be set. When the next day morning we asked for direction to the Ginza Station, the staff personally walked us to the station and even showed us how to buy our train ticket. Now that's service! A good hotel is not only about hardware (I have been new hotels like Prince Gallery Tokyo where the hotel is new from outside to the room, however, the service especially cold smile and slack attitude from their staff team gave you the impression that they are just doing their job rather responding actively to what customers need). In comparison, RC Carlton Tokyo is the place where you can feel the hotel staff is smiling from their heart and serving customers like their family members. This is the sort of service that endears one to a hotel and we cannot wait to return. Great luck for RC Tokyo to have such an excellent staff members like Mao, Kana and Mark. What a pity that Mark is leaving soon due to the end of internship placement. What makes me happier that I would still be able to see Mao and Kana in the near future and RC Tokyo will be my ONLY choice for my stay in Tokyo thanks to the great service from Mao and Kana and their colleagues too. I will also for sure recommend RC Tokyo to my business contacts and personal friends as their first choice in considering RC Tokyo as their destination hotel in Tokyo.","Sydney, Australia","Neo_J_Chen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",4,5.0

I do think the service here edges out the others and the location in MidTown is hard to beat.

But, the RC in Tokyo, definitely is not it’s younger, newer “sibling.” Our family had a 3 night stay here over the Christmas holiday. In fairness, the service at the RC Tokyo was quite good. We arrived with a warm welcome curbside, from Alex, the guest relations manager, who is a tremendous asset to the property, as is Masako Ito, the head concierge. While the property itself is not so old. Since Tokyo is evolving so dramatically and so quickly, the RC Tokyo does seem a bit older, than it really is. It is supposed to be a smoke free environment, yet the lobby consistently wreaked of cigarettes. Mostly coming from their bar area. But, since it is an open layout, of course the stench would permeate the rest of the lobby, which is well appointed. Quite glam and westernized. But, pretty generic, typical Ritz aesthetic in the common areas. Nothing particularly memorable or distinctive. Could be anywhere really. One of the upsides to being in a very tall building though, are the amazing views of Tokyo and beyond. Our family had adjoining rooms facing Mount Fuji which was nice. The rooms were a good size. Not small. Not large. Just fine. The bathrooms were somewhat larger in scale than I expected based not the room size. But, both were kind of generic and somewhat dated in my opinion. Everything was in working order and no visible damage. Just...fine. Think it is time for a refresh with the interior design.The only meal we had on premise was breakfast each day. The restaurant is nice enough, although I was put off when I asked for a table one morning, and was politely shown the lobby seating area instead of a proper table, when there were clearly several empty tables. Keep in mind, we only needed a table for 4pp. When I asked, as to why I could not dine in the actual restaurant, the master d inquired if I had a reservation. Seriously? A reservation for breakfast? As a hotel guest? Alex, the guest relations manager was nearby and I asked for his assistance. The situation was quickly rectified and we were offered a normal dining table accordingly. The quality of the breakfast was fine, once we were seated. But, this experience did not sit well, no pun intended. Outside of this one blip in service though, our overall interactions with the staff were excellent throughout the hotel.In my opinion, the team at the RC Tokyo is more impressive than the property itself. The hotel is very nice. Good quality. Solid experience. Though, I would prefer to try elsewhere on my next visit to Tokyo-probably Mandarin or Aman.

Third, the front desk staff is efficient, helpful and truly service oriented. Fourth, the hotel includes a spa and a gym...both of very high quality. Fifth, all of the rooms offer expansive views over sprawling Tokyo with no nearby buildings to block/interfere with that view. Sixth, there is a very large and very nice lounge area with great views (including, when clear, a view of Mt. Fuji). Seventh, there are multiple subway lines crisscrossing on the surrounding streets, so there is very good access to many parts of Tokyo without having to deal with traffic. Eighth, there are several museums located within a short walk and the complex is part of a shopping complex with four, or so, floors of food & beverage outlets ranging from pizza to fine dining.The rooms are large, the beds are comfortable, the amenities are first rate as are the finishings. All-in-all, a quality hotel.From my perspective, the location is not ideal....but that may be because I don't really care for shopping malls, the area is a quite a distance from many of the things I come to Tokyo to see and do, and it is a bit of a hassle, and not inexpensive, to travel about above-ground.

However, if you're looking for what a 5-star experience should be, look no further than the Ritz Carlton Tokyo.Located in the Tokyo Midtown development in Roppongi, the hotel is convenient to the business area of Roppongi/Akasaka. However, the Roppongi metro stop can take you quickly anywhere in the city.Arriving by taxi from Tokyo Station (< 1500 yen), the bell staff quickly retrieved my luggage and escorted me to the elevator that would whisk me to the 45th floor where the lobby is located. He asked my name before pressing the floor button and whispered it into a headset he was wearing.Upon arriving to the floor, a staff member was waiting for me and greeted me by name and escorted me to the check-in counter. A quick check-in process but was told my room would only be ready in a short time. No problem for me, as I was early anyway and retreated to the nearby cafe where free coffee and tea are provided all day. By the time I had my coffee in my hand, the desk staff approached me to tell me that my room was ready (they offered to escort me to the room, but I was a repeat guest and knew the way). Baggage was delivered shortly thereafter.The rooms at the Ritz are HUGE, especially by Tokyo standards. A plush bed, a small sofa, and convenient work station are all present. An extra large (60""?) LCD TV is present as well as a smaller one in the bath.For those that may get chilly in the room, a beautiful cashmere blanket is provided. One of those things you wish you could take home.The bathroom is also enormous. With two, nicely spaced apart vanities, a large bathtub, as well as a spacious stand-up shower. Asprey toiletries are provided. I know of Asprey as a prestigious jeweler and not a cosmetic company but the bath wash and shampoos were very nice.When I returned to the room after venturing out, a selection of pralines from the ground floor Ritz Carlton Deli were sitting on the desk. Delicious and beautiful. Also present was a wonderful handwritten card from the woman who had checked me in. More than just a ""thank you for staying"", it was more applicable to me specifically and was a very thoughtful touch.I am pretty knowledgable about Tokyo having spent considerable time there over the years but always check in about new and up and coming restaurants. The concierge staff at the RC was very helpful and provided a number of suggestions to me. I also inquired about purchasing the cashmere blanket mentioned earlier. Unfortunately, they do not sell them new although the staffperson did spend some time checking on that for me.I did not dine at the hotel this trip but I can tell you from past experience the cafe is excellent with a wide variety of western and asian selections. The lobby bar also has a wonderful selection of whiskies and even some unique wine selections.Unfortunately, my stay was only for one night and I was off early the following morning. This time, I took the (dreaded) ""Friendly Limousine Bus"" to Narita. While its nice to avoid needing to go to the train station and drag your luggage through that, the bus is not my favorite since the RC is the first stop it makes before stopping at 4-5 other hotels. You're driving around Roppongi/Akasaka for 45 minutes before you finally get on the expressway. It's not the fault of the hotel but I wish they could get on a different route. Of course a taxi is available but for $300 I avoid it. Haneda Airport is always preferable regardless.All in all, I love the Ritz Carlton Tokyo and look forward to my next visit there.",Asia,"ExpatTravelFoodie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Asia</strong>",51,5.0

Then, when we were taken to our seats we had to wait another 20 minutes before we were even spoken to.The waiter asked which tea we would like, and when they served it it was a completely different kind. We asked politely to bring us the ones we had ordered, and what happened was unbelievable. They told us repeatedly that we were wrong, and even snickered. But how would anyone mistake the tea that they’d sampled and chosen just a while ago? The tea we had chosen were fruit teas, and we were both very sure that those did not have the scent nor the taste of the fruits we had chosen. We could even tell which other teas they had brought.The service itself was horrible as well. I have never been kept waiting for more drinks or for the bill for so long at a luxury hotel like the Ritz Carlton.As for the afternoon tea set, delicious as always, but the waitress not knowing the dishes well was disappointing.","Tokyo, Japan","chpntky</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",2,2.0

And lastly, as a guest you get access to the pool and hot tub, but if you want access to steam room / sauna / plunge pools, they charge Yen 3000 extra - which given the price of the rooms is totally over the top in my opinion. All of this should be included with room rate, given the very high room rates. At least they throw wifi in for free, but the pool/spa thing seems excessive.

We started in Tokyo and stayed at the Ritz. Our room was on the 49th floor and the hotel part of this skyscraper starts on floor 45. As you can imagine, any view from this altitude is spectacular. Ours, not lacking in the slightest. Both breathtaking and gorgeous. The room had a king bed and a huge bathroom, well appointed with his and his sinks, plus a bath and wc. And, if you are unfamiliar with Japanese toilets, this is a good place to learn how to use them. Find a video on YouTube to find out what I mean. You'll never use paper again. We ate breakfast everyday at the banquet. Excellent choices of both western and Japanese style eating. I had the poached egg every day because it was awesome. They use a leak purée as well as a salmon soft cheese. Omg, delicious! The service, superb and the food high quality (as with almost any restaurant here - it's clear to me now that the Japanese place value on freshness and flavor). The spa is located on the 46th floor and it includes a lap pool, which for me was perfect. Swimming helps me to adjust to jet lag like nothing else. Plus, it's not a place where kids run amok in the swimming area. Like everything in Japan, politeness is the main theme. No screaming kids, you can count on it. If you forgot your swim suit, no worries, you can rent one. One requirement is a swim cap which they also provide fee of charge. Both my partner and I booked a half hour stretch which neither of us regretted and the spa offers the full suite of massage and other treatments that you would expect. The body worker who did the stretching was an expert and knew exactly when not to stretch any further. He was both intuitive and attentive to how you responded. This, also another jet lag cure. Do it instead of a massage and you just might feel the same. Later, we even received a hand written note from Chihiro, a wonderful spa staff person who spoke fluent English and who had also lived in the US, where she welcomed us personally to the hotel and explained that she was available if we had any questions. A very sweet personal touch and I appreciated the extra effort. Don't we all?The front door staff were also professional and we were greeted everyday by Kato, a Japanese American from the islands of Hawaii. Maui, I believe, and he was incredibly helpful with tour suggestions and places to eat. You will be lucky to have him around during your stay. If I had to say anything about our trip to Japan, it's the people, if you haven't noticed yet. The culture demands that you respect one another, which is refreshing to put it mildly. And it's not just the hotel staff I'm talking about. Put on your most polite face, allow others to go through the elevator door before you, offer your seat to an old woman on the subway, and generally act as if you honor the Japanese culture, and you will have arrived. Even in the bustling train stations or at the airport, notice how everyone is coordinating their steps in order to give you passageway; anticipating how they will negotiate your presence. It's a ballet of sorts and remarkable, especially when you find yourself amidst the crowds, and it's also a metaphor for the rest of your interactions. And although one of our new friends here said that, generally speaking, the Japanese are a shy people and hard to get to know, if you step outside of your comfort zone, look people warmly in the eyes and sincerely greet them; a bow from the hips, a kind word, then you too can make a few new friends here as I did. I totally love Japan now, I hope you do too.",,Jeffsf1019,21,5.0

You can only have access if your room key is activated for it. Presumably exclusive, it is decorated nicely, like a living room lounge. They say they have 5 servings per day. For an additional guest there is a charge of Y-6500 or approximately USD 65 per serving for each guest. Thought that was unusual but I suppose it is to discourage all day business meetings.On the room rates, it is approximately USD200 more to have club access daily.So far so good, its pretty exclusive. I thought I would get spoiled there. OMG what a disappointment !!! I travel frequently and I could say a few things about executive lounges, but this one truly blew me away on the utterly poor offerings and moreso the poorest quality of them.They highly recommended their afternoon tea. I tried it. Before the plate came I took some champagne, a tradition for afternoon tea. It was Ritz Carlton brand, was quite sweet, despite the label showing Brut. That was the only one they had.When the tray tower came I gasped. I tried tasting a bit of each. Extremely disappointed in the quality the small sandwich of ham was not nice. fThe scones were quite small, size of silver dollar, not really scones on the dough either. In the shops I have found that Japanese companies will take an item from Europe, bring it back home and make a better, super version. But in the Ritz Carlton, sadly I found the opposite in their afternoon tea. Just terrible.A day later I stopped by for a bite at dinner time. I tried the sake, again this was sweet. I had one small glass did not like it. I wanted a different kind but they only have one kind. Despite there being several people serving around the lounge they did not come by.  I tried some canapés. There is a young girl serving udon noodles. I was able to request various spices for her to cook me a bowl. Meat was not an option, only spices. That did not go well, she brought the bowl of noodles just cooked and it was lukewarm. Ok never mind that, order another, this time requesting the soup and noodles to be hot. In fact I found most of the food cold. Ugh, really that wasn't nice. How can this be the Ritz Carlton.I took some of the vegetables and they were completely cold as were a few dim sum buns. How could everything be cold, this was supposed to the hot food area, as another small room had salad and salami cold meats.In the hot area, there were two large pots. One filled with mashed potatoes and a meat gravy, the other pot was boiling and full of brown curry and did not smell appetizing. They were hot, I could only try the mash potatoes. Two nites later I found exactly the same foods. Again, I had to ask is this the Ritz Carlton Tokyo ? OMG, how could they let this happen and sink to such low levels?","New York City, New York","Susan B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",70,3.0

I wish we could have stayed all two weeks of our vacation. Literally, from the moment we got out of the taxi the staff and property were nothing but perfection. The minute you walk in you may notice this very light and lovely scent throughout the hotel. It just sets this feeling of extreme relaxation. Check in was so easy, our room was beautiful, all the facilities- pool, gym, spa, were amazing and so well appointed.All the staff that we had contact with were an absolute dream. Polite, helpful, warm. We had a club level room which included access to the club on 53rd floor (I think) for breakfast, lunch,afternoon tea, evening cocktails, and late night desserts--- and everyone who worked in the club- the servers, chefs, and hosts were flawless. The food was always amazing. Drinks and cocktails fabulous.The location of the hotel couldn't be better- linked by an underground mall to the Roppongi station-- from there you can get anywhere. So many wonderful itzakayas in Roppongi. Mid-town was having a wonderful summer in mid-town- with outdoor bars, light shows, and shallow dipping stream for kids and adults. It was almost like this small town feeling in the middle of this crazy bustling city. The Japanese do really know the balance of peace and nature versus movement and modernity.I would come back to Ritz Carlton again and again and again.

It's certainly well deserved. The whole experience - from the staff, accommodations, dining, and music are top notch. How the Ritz Tokyo truly differentiated itself lies with its people and their genuine hospitality that far exceeds expectations. For instance, as this was a few day business trip with colleagues (our first time to Tokyo from the US), we wanted to explore the area during our limited free time. While on-site, I responded to the General Manager (John) welcome email inquiring about whether we should tour the Fish Market. John promptly connected me with his Purchasing Manager (Kenji) who graciously offered a personal tour at 6am the following morning to accommodate our work timing commitments. Upon meeting him in the lobby, it was to our surprise he was accompanied by the Hotel Manager (Masato) and Purchasing Clerk (Kazuki) who all led us on an unforgettable tour of the market, including navigating the subway system and finding the perfect place to enjoy a sushi lunch.To make matters even more memorable (and in the spirit of continuing to surpass our expectations), after my colleagues and I returned to our hotel rooms after work, we were each greeted with a framed group picture of the seven of us taken at the market. A sincere ""Arigatou"" to John, Masato, Kenji, and Kazuki who left an indelible impression for our time here in Tokyo.","Raleigh, North Carolina","dmav007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Raleigh, North Carolina</strong>",2,5.0

For RC Tokyo, I had a few emails from the guest relations prior to arriving so inquired about getting an upgraded room since I was a Gold Elite member. I felt I didn't get any upgrades at Kyoto so I wanted to see what I could get here. When I checked in, the lady from guest relations did meet us and told us we had an upgrade to a tower room. This meant a standard room that was facing the Tokyo tower. Our room was on 48th floor and view was good so I was pleased. It looks like they typically charge more for that so I guess it was an upgrade. We used points for our 4 night stay. One thing that bothers me with Ritz-Carlton compared to staying at a standard Marriott is that a Gold Elite typically has a club level room and access to the club lounge. Not here. The charge is $200 (22,000¥) more per night for club lounge access. That's crazy. So we did not get the lounge access. As everyone commenting has written, the service is excellent otherwise. The lady who showed us to our room let me know that if we wanted to use the pool, which I did, no tattoos could be visible! That is crazy! I have some on my arms, shoulder and leg so I would have to wear a full body suit to swim in the pool. Now days, tattoos are not forbidden in the world except apparently here. I am a CEO of my own company and travel extensively around the globe and this is the first time I was blocked from swimming. Crazy. So after I got over that, I looked over the room. It was decent size and the view from the oversized windows was great. It was just as nice at night time. The lobby on the 45th floor is very large with a few restaurants. It can get very smoky at night when you walk through. We ate breakfast the first morning. It is a breakfast buffet with made to order eggs brought to you table. It will cost you $90 for two. Very steep price but it is the Ritz. There are many more choices for meals in the Mid Town mall that is connected on the first floor or just within a few blocks (Mercer Buffet was good). The other nice thing about this location is the adjacent park that has things going on during the summer. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary so they did bring in balloons and chocolate that evening. Overall we had a good stay. Bed was good and shades were dark enough that we could sleep in. Shower was good also. So if you don't have tattoos and want to splurge for a great view of the city, then Ritz Carlton Tokyo is a good stay.

Overall, I would recommend this hotel, but with two caveats.I cannot commend the service provided by the RC staff highly enough. Every single staff member that we interacted with was warm, friendly and efficient. We felt that every staff member was also very focused on our needs as guests, rather than simply ""doing a job"".We were also very satisfied with the quality of the restaurants we tried and the pool and fitness centre. The location and the nearby mall (Midtown) are very convenient. For travellers who want to grab a quick breakfast near the hotel but not in the hotel itself, the Midtown mall offers many options.My two caveats are as follows:1. I was satisfied with the room that we were given (my wife was less impressed, it must be said!) but I was very disappointed to find that the room did not have the amenities and conveniences that you find in newer luxury hotels in Asia - in particular, there were no bed-side power outlets or USB ports for plugging in phones or other devices. I understand the Ritz Carlton Tokyo is 10 years old now and therefore the rooms were designed at a time before virtually every traveller carries at least one phone or other device that needs to be charged, so I understand why this is. I should also point out that there were a number of power outlets at the desk in the room, so you will not be searching for places to charge your devices. Hopefully this can be addressed next time the rooms are refurbished.2. The hotel has multiple entrances, for convenience, however only the main entrance is open after 10pm. For travellers who arrive at the hotel by taxi, this is fine. However, my wife and I travelled by train most days, and faced a slightly longer walk from the train station to the front entrance as we generally were out until at least 10.30pm each night. I would like to see the policy changed so that the other entrances remain open until at least 11pm each night.Overall, I did enjoy my stay and if it was possible to give a 4.5 out of 5 rating, I would do so. These blemishes prevent me from giving a perfect 5 out of 5 rating, but if neither of these complaints is relevant to you, I think you will greatly enjoy staying here.","Singapore, Singapore","eugenewong70</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",7,4.0

However, our experience at the RC Tokyo was subpar. First of all, I had made a reservation for a table at the bar, towards the front and with a view, which somehow had disappeared. We were offered a table at a (very smoky) smoking area, which we declined. After several minutes of standing and negotiating with the staff we were eventually given a table.The food at the bar was way below RC standards, and very poor value for money. My request for late checkout was declined, which is poor in any situation and especially so for a status holder. My room was OK but relatively small for Tokyo standards. Finally, I asked for a meeting room for an hour, as I had to make a late night conference call, and the hotel was not able to meet that request either. The bottom line is that this could have been a nice hotel, but the service I received was so poor for RC or Japan standards that I will definitely not be coming back.","New York City, New York","EvanK_HK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,3.0

The food preparations are excellent, including a rather formal afternoon tea service with an incredible menu of teas and miniature sandwiches and desserts presented with tradition and elegance. The spa experience leaves out nothing. Not only was the massage wonderful, but the service before and after it. They even have make-up to use for those who shower after their massages. Any towels you use are picked up almost immediately and everything is pristine and clean like I've never experienced. The hotel is also located near the metro, next to shopping and a market and several good restaurants. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Tokyo.

The Ritz-Carlton is, unquestionably, a 5 star property! It starts on the 45th floor of the office building and goes upward from there. You take an elevator from the ground floor to the 45th floor lobby and then another elevator to your rooms which, in our case, were on the 54th floor. Size-wise, the guest rooms are enormous for hotels in Japan and even larger than most US hotel rooms. Plus, the views were spectacular. The hotel is located across the street from Hinokicho Park where you can stroll or sit on the grass like locals. The Cherry Blossoms were still in bloom during our visit and very pretty. If you do not wish to eat at the hotel, there are numerous restaurants within walking distance just down the hill after you go under the elevated train tracks into the Roppongi district. There are also several Lawson type mini markets in the area where you can purchase snacks or items for breakfast if you wish. In spite of the steep room cost per night, there were lots of people staying here including quite a few couples with small children. Overall the stay was an amazing experience. From the Ritz-Carlton to the Harumi Passenger Ship Terminal cost about $40.","Phoenix, Arizona","Al154</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",18,5.0

Upon check-in, we were informed that we had been upgraded to the ""bigger"" Carlton Suite. Sounds great, right? Well, first of all, the Carlton Suite had an entirely different view--no Fuji-san! Incredibly disappointing, considering this was a huge deciding factor for me when I originally booked the Executive Suite. Further, and perhaps more terrible, the Carlton Suite basically had no view at all. The ""panoramic"" views were entirely obstructed by a humongous slab of concrete jutting out from the windows on our level. We could not see out of the living room, closet, or one bedroom window. We could only see out of the smallest bedroom window. It was never mentioned to me at any point during check-in that the view would be different or that it was almost entirely obstructed. Honestly, I feel ripped off. I booked this hotel to have an epic view for our last night in Tokyo and we couldn't even see it. The ""upgrade"" felt like I was conned. I could have had the EXACT SAME view from their most basic Deluxe room. So why did I pay the extra?! We certainly didn't need the space for our short stay.Also, there was a gross hair in the shower! (Not mine!) And housekeeping never cleared our room service plates despite us asking them to.

Meanwhile, if you are a frequent especially business traveller, please don't put high hope in this hotel because they may not live up with your high expectation. You won't get much advantages by being a loyal member. In here, I want to highlight their concierge services. I have hinted many times to the concierge that I was looking for top quality restaurants especially those with michelin star or awarded restaurants. None of them can offer me any decent recommendation. Finally, I had to list out all the restaurants for them to help my reservations. During the reservations, some of them needs to be guaranteed to avoid cancellation. I am OK with this arrangement so I filled in the guarantee form they asked for. When I faxed it, the number they gave us doesn't work for overseas because it is much shorter. Secondly, I found out later than they did hold up the credit for the meals first.

The staff (both at the front desk and in the club lounge) are the most attentive and professional I have seen anywhere in the world (so much so, that you might even feel underwhelmed by subsequent stays at other--magnificent--RC properties). Ikuko, one of the directors at the hotel, is the best at what she does and helps to create an environment in which guests feel like VIPs. The rooms/suites--from the three I have seen at this property--are all beautiful and provide spectacular views of the city, Tokyo Tower, or Mt. Fuji (if the weather is right). The beds aren't QUITE as comfortable, in my opinion, as those you might find at Westin hotels, but the closets, bathrooms and amenities here are second to none and will make you feel beyond comfortable during your time at the hotel.The club lounge is one of the best I've seen and is definitely worth trying out. The food is delicious (much of it prepared by chefs who man a section that is open, seemingly, from the time the lounge opens its doors until it closes them), and the service is on another level. The views and ambiance help make it a place of calm, luxurious serenity that I enjoyed starting and ending my busy Tokyo days in.The fitness center was very well maintained and staffed and the pool--though I did not try it out--looked nice and also provided some great views over the city.The Ritz Carlton, Tokyo somehow continues to surpass all of my expectations and will stay put as my favorite hotel in the world.

My review is based on my expectations for a 5 star level hotel.Check in was seamless- there were 4 of us and actually checked each of us in our respective rooms. So no awkward lines at the front desk. The only bad thing was that when she checked me in and signed me up to the Ritz Carlton membership (the forms were filled in already) she flipped my name so I keep getting mailers addressing me by my last part of my last name(my last name is hyphenated)... I wrote to Ritz membership but hasnt been fixed!All our rooms faced smack in front of the Tokyo Tower which was beautiful at nights. They left some macaroon treats in the sitting area which was nice. Water bottles were free of charge. I got a fruit plate my sister had ordered for me to help me recover a bit upon arrival from a long flight- but was a teeny tiny portion( my sister had specified extra large portion...she saw the portion and was disappointed)Breakfast was included in our stay so I had breakfast in the restaurant on the lobby/reception level- nice views. Great food selection (both western and Asian) but I found the restaurant to be a bit smallish.Our rooms also came with a $100 or $200 credit to the room for expenses in the hotel but we were all pretty busy so didn't get to use/apply it. I did find it odd that they still charged extra $5 for a local phone call- why wouldn't they give credit to that from that $100？Location- very convenient to Roppongi.

Prior to arriving, we emailed them to make some restaurant reservations.We agreed to a higher rate that included breakfast. I don't recommend doing so. The breakfast is a typical buffet. The food is not impressive and service stops before 10:30AM. On Sunday morning, we were advised that service would stop at 10:15AM and by then the staff had not replenished some breakfast options. I recommend eating breakfast near the hotel. There is a Starbucks in the building.The bigger disappointment was the pool. It was fun having a pool 50 or so floors above Tokyo. The indoor pool and jacuzzi have long chairs where you can relax. My issue firstly the noise. There were kids playing around in the pool the two times I visited and the staff did nothing to ask them to lower their noise. The other and bigger issue was 2 adults making out bluntly in the pool right by my lounge chair. I looked at one of the staff members who did not anything and thus moved to another chair. Unfortunately, they moved near my chair while playing around in the pool. Afterwards, I complained to the front desk and very disappointed by the response. I got an apology note from the spa manager.

No slamming of doors at 3 in the morning... You cannot hear the doors shut.- Rooms are ridiculously quiet. Which I REALLY appreciate.- Full blackout shade for the full window in the room.

All controlled by a panel in the night stand by the bed.- Double vanity sinks !- We were very lucky - visiting right smack dab in the middle of cherry blossom peak bloom. They have a big park downstairs that is obviously beautiful with all the blossoming cherry trees. Couple minor negatives:- They take our towels every single time they come in to clean up or freshen up. There is a ""Recycle"" sign, (hang up, blah, blah, blah), but they still take them every time.- You enter the building on the street level and then escorted / directed to the 45th floor ""Lobby"".The 45th floor ""Lobby"" (where a majority of folks check in and visit the concierge, also where there is a big panoramic bar of Tokyo (i.e. ""Lost in Translation""), allows smoking... As you would imagine, midday seems to be fine, but evening and into morning is pretty smoky...- The Galleria shopping is not ummmm normal shopping... $8 USD white strawberry (just one and apparently not very good).- Very fortunately we were able to find a coin operated laundry place, less then 5 minutes walk from the property.

We can compare the Ritz standard to the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo where we stayed two nights before moving to the Ritz - not a good choice.While Mandarin offered us a free upgrade to a corner suite we had to wait 45 minutes for the checking-in procedure at Ritz because the front desk lady tried to sell us an upgrade for 750 Euro/night to another suite. Spa is not complimentary (as at Mandarin for suite guests), everything you might expect from renting a suite costs extra. Interior of the room is not impressive, lights are by far too low and the front desk lady excused herself by saying that many guests find the suite to be to dark but organizing for an extra lamp might be to complicated. Ok, what should you expect from a room of 1.000 USD plus/night ??Unbelievable but true we tried to get a table at the window in the lobby after eating in the michelin star restaurant and we were told both evenings that this table was already payed (!) for by another guest and that's why we won't get it, though no one was there. And this is exactly how it feels to stay at this hotel: as a cash cow who should not expect extraordinary 5 star service and the friendliness you are used to from other Tokyo hotels like the Mandarin.Not to mention that I waited for 30 minutes for my omelett on Club floor during breakfast and didn't got it. Then we had to leave, very unsatisfying.Hopefully, service at Ritz at Kyoto is better, we will do a hotel check there in 1,5 weeks and after that unsatisfying experience in Tokyo we're wondering if Ritz is doing there a better job.

My partner lived in Tokyo for almost his entire life before moving to the United States in 2015. As a result, we travel to Tokyo often. The Ritz is located in Roppongi, which is in the middle of Tokyo. It is conveniently located next to the Tokyo subway; Hibiya, Oedo and Chiyoda lines. The property is immaculate with amazing views from the 45th - 53rd floors. The club lounge is spectacular. The staff are well-trained, extremely helpful and always go out of the way to assure your stay is pleasant. Because it is Japan, no gratuities are accepted. The only less than good thing I could say is stay away from the hotel's fine dining restaurant-Azure 45. It supposedly has a Michelin Star, but I strongly disagree. My partner and I made reservations in advance and requested a window table. This request was neither acknowledged nor accommodated. The ""french"" food was not what one would expect. Bland, no complex, flavorful cream sauces and too much nouveau foam and froth. In fact, there was emphasis on spicy, such as overly indulged in paprika. Do not let the restaurant dissuade you from staying at the Ritz. As you would expect, staying at the Ritz is not cheap, but it is overall well worth the money spent.

We checked in by chance at exactly at the time rooms are agreed to be 'ready'; however this was clearly not the case. After being asked to wait for a 'few minutes', which amounted to just short of half an hour, we were eventually shown to our room.The room was nice, the view as expected and the amenities as one would expect from such a hotel - I imagine like something Macaulay Culkins parents would have enjoyed on their trip in the original 1990 Home Alone - however the sequel would have seen them outdated. Do fittings from 1990's qualify as classic yet?In any event, we arrived in the room, and waited. And waited. After an hour I felt as if the young gentleman who had only moments ago sincerely promised to take good care of my luggage, had not been as heartfelt as first thought. After calling reception, the bags arrived in exactly the amount of time it would take for reception to call the lobby and the lobby to think 'crap' and run the forgotten bags up to my room. The sweaty bell-man came free.After our afternoon activities, we returned to the hotel lobby and attempted to organise to eat at the hotel - something one would think is not daunting. Ha.I understand a good restaurant should be booked in advance; but this completely neglects the purpose behind having a HOTEL restaurant. The restaurant we preferred was booked out, as I'm sure you've gathered by this point, so we were suggested the other (only) available option, which was not available however until 9PM, or thereabouts. The lovely staff suggested we move to the hotel bar for the wait, which seemed like a good idea for almost all of the 20m walk across the lobby.Arriving at the bar, we were informed of the $20 US cover charge to simply, well, drink at the bar. A $20 cover charge?? Yes. You need to pay us so you can pay us to drink at our bar whilst you pay us to stay at our hotel.We sat at the bar, surrounded by drunk non-guest businessmen entertaining even drunker clients. I'm not sure exactly what point the hotel bar became a turnstile for additional-revenue - but it was clear this was at the expense of the actual hotel guests.We retired to the room to change, cancel the reservation and embark on an expedition to find somewhere else to eat, and ironically on the elevator ride out, we were accompanied by one of the large tables of loud, drunk businessmen; who occupied the bar to the same extent an insect occupies your kitchen; uninvited and certainly not paying the exorbitant rent.At a hotel of this range, the writer would have expected the level of service to go beyond simply employing good staff and toward good management, which certainly resulted in a terrible stay for us.Dear Ritz - please don't write the standard, albeit condescending, 'we're sorry for your experience' comment under this, we both know it's for the benefit of the readers/potential customers, and not mine.","Sydney, Australia","Rhys D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",21,1.0

The front desk gave me a good room and the concierge was very helpful. I only had one real issue with the hotel. The lobby restaurant needs to prioritize hotel guests. Apparently many local housewives frequent the lobby restaurant for lunch, high tea or evening drinks. On two separate occasions I was told that I could not sit in the restaurant in the non smoking section due to reservations made. On the first occasion in the evening of my arrival I sat in the smoking section (and I hate to eat near people who are smoking for obvious reasons). On the second occasion at lunch I got a bit testy. I observed that the customers were groups of Japanese women taking the occupied tables and there were empty but ""reserved"" view tables throughout. So at 1pm on a weekday I can't have lunch in my own hotel lobby restaurant because locals had ""reserved"" tables. I told the hostess that as a hotel guest I should have priority over local housewives who occupy the main dining area for over two hours each afternoon. The hostess finally sat me at one of the ""reserved"" tables but the hotel needs to keep a certain number of good view tables in the non smoking section open for hotel guests. Guests pay to have the amenity and convenience of in house dining and to enjoy the view of a city that they may not visit again. Hotel guests should be treated as guests not as ones who interfere with the locals who do not pay a hefty amount for that in house amenity. Like any high end hotel if there is a wait to sit in the hotel lobby restaurant there should be a line for hotel guests and tables held open for them. Any other outside visitor should be given tables with limited views and there should be a limited number of tables designated for non hotel visitors.

Large bath, separate shower with two different showerheads (one of which is a rainwater head), two separate sinks and even a TV!The views from the room were exceptional.As we were only there for one night I can't comment on many of the restaurants but we did spoil ourselves and enjoy a degustation with matched wines at Azure 45. Boasting a Michelin Star this is certainly not a cheap eat, but well worth it if you'd like the treat yourself. Attentive staff, an incredible view of Tokyo Tower (ask for a table by the window if possible) and a mouth-watering array of food.Staff at the hotel are very helpful with everything and will bend over backwards to ensure your stay is comfortable. The area surrounding the hotel (which includes a nice park) defies the Japan stereotype of small, squishy and packed with people.

Check in was truly fun as we were whisked away to the 53rd floor and made comfortable in the Club Lounge. Before our drinks arrived Ikuko Director of rooms arrived to greet us (she’s amazing) then introduced us to Valter who took care of all our paperwork. Our room was large, spotless and had all the amenities one would want. The bathrooms a delight with dual sinks, soaking tub and my absolute favorite shower. The walk-in shower is large with both a hand sprayer and overhead rainforest fixtures. Beds, sheets, towels all luxury.  The Ritz Carlton is located in the Roppongi area with a Metro station just a few steps away. The Tokyo Metro subway system is convenient and goes everywhere. Be sure to get a Pasmo or Suica prepaid card (reloadable) to make it easy to just jump on and off trains. The Midtown Galleria Mall is directly below the Ritz hotel with a great selection of stores and dining options. There’s even a high end grocery store called Precce in the mall. Roppongi is loaded with great attractions by day or night. Tokyo or Shinagawa stations are a short cab or Metro train ride away and very convenient to get to the Shinkansen (Bullet train) which is a must do. The Club Lounge the Concierge to us Marriott Elites is second to none. The service is truly amazing, the staff is extremely attentive and speak perfect English. We were having trouble getting wifi on our phones and Leo jumped in and got us online in seconds Kudos’ Leo! Amazing views of Mt Fuji and Tokyo. The Club Lounge has several rooms our favorite was the Library. Food options were tasty we were also able to have breakfast in Towers on the 45th floor. The buffet and full service menus featuring western and Japanese dishes was simply delicious. Be sure to try the Perfect Egg. The sunrise over Tokyo Tower was truly spectacular do yourself a favor and get there early for sunrise at least once. You really need to treat yourself to the Club Lounge level. The spa and fitness center staff was great and the equipment received high marks from my wife. The view from the treadmills was spectacular to say the least. The pool has to be seen to believe! The front desk staff was attentive and very helpful converting currency, making Limo bus reservations, looking up phone numbers. Same great service with the Concierge Team. The overall atmosphere and dedication demonstrated by the staff is something every hotel should take note of. Getting there is easy from Narita airport the Limousine bus will take you to the front door of the Ritz Carlton for 3100 Yen or the Narita Express train which is quicker but you have to deal with your luggage to Tokyo or Shinagawa station then take a cab or a metro subway.  As with our visits prior Ikuko made it a point to come say goodbye and thank us.

The attention to detail and impecable service by the personnel place it squarely in the major hospitality league where it rightfully belongs - and the only league it should be in considering the price. The hotel's restaurants and the breakfast buffet serve wonderfully prepared dishes, both Japanese and western. The rooms are impecably clean, with furnishings in classic, laquered wood, invoking a modern art-deco look (albeit somewhat dated, with a patina left by years of use slowly becoming evident). The panoramic views of Tokyo are stunning and worth every cent (we had a standard double on the 48th floor). Where Ritz had me puzzled however was in the most unexpected places, and by things that clearly belonged in an establishment with fewer stars and lower prices. For one, we were asked to pay an additional 50'000 yen per person (about usd 40) to be able to use the sauna/steam room facilities at the spa (the swimming pool was free) - something simply preposterous given the 1'200 USD price tag of the room. Charging extra for basic spa facilities simply doesn't belong to a hotel of this level. Neither does being put on a waiting list to get a table at breakfast. Whether this happened because tables had already been taken by external guests or because there wasn't enough tables to accommodate all of the hotel guests in the first place - I don't know, but the closest association a line of hungry people waiting to have breakfast invokes in my mind is an all-inclusive Club Med resort. It's these relatively small things that kept us wondering whether the hotel is simply trying to maximize revenue (and diluting its brand in the process), or whether it's fallen on hard times and needs the extra cash - which with places such as the new Aman, Hyatt and the Peninsula making for formidable competition wouldn not be surprizing. Either way, we'll be booking elsewhere for our next trip to this stunning city.

The hotel is ultramodern and occupies the top floors of one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo. The view from the lobby and the rooms puts you in the middle of a vista from a science fiction movie, with an endless city in most directions and Mt Fuji -- if you are lucky -- rising in the distance.Service was exceptional. We are not the most demanding hotel guests in terms of our service expectations, but we were surprised -- in a positive way -- on a couple of occasions. Upon check in, for example, we were presented with the appropriate personalized documents before presenting any identification. Did the woman who greeted us at the car entrance open up our luggage tags and radio our names to the lobby 45 floors above? Perhaps, but it was all seamless and invisible. Every day when we came back from a day of wandering around Tokyo, we would be met in the lobby by a greeter who inquired about our day and gave us advice for the next day.The rooms are excellent, with no evidence of any element showing any sign of age or wear. Room service was excellent and punctual. On the morning of one of our stays, we experienced a substantial (M6.9 or M7.3 depending on who you ask) earthquake that caused the whole building to slowing sway for a couple of minutes. Room service still arrived exactly on time, about 30 minutes later.The sushi restaurant at the hotel is outstanding. It is not inexpensive, but that was not a surprise. It was probably our favorite meal in Japan, with the possible exception of a many course kaiseki meal that we had a few days later in a ryokan.Tokyo is such a sprawling city with no well-defined center that we weren't sure the best location to use as a base for exploration. The Ritz-Carlton worked extremely well. We had easy subway access in every direction.For us -- an American couple looking to explore Tokyo -- the Ritz was an outstanding choice.","San Francisco, California","kalmone07</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",40,5.0

I was very surprised by that and even if in Japan that is legal/allowed, I never stayed at a nice Western brand hotel there that allowed it or didn't successfully mask the smell.Small other quibbles were that the bathroom was not as modern as sister Ritz Carlton properties in Japan (the tv felt a bit dated among other things) and turn down wasn't as consistently thorough like I've noticed at other comparable hotels where they might fold some items and stack them. The concierge was responsive though two small things were that one restaurant they said was open on NYE was in fact closed and they wouldn't send names of suggestions in advance (perhaps preferring to do face to face for better service but it allowing me to do my own research in advance of checking in). The pedestrian entrance also is a bit underwhelming and a small labyrinth to access the elevators to the lobby (the car entrance on the other hand is what you'd expect).

I left a raincoat there and Osamu Ishikawa delivered it personally that same afternoon to my new hotel (switched just to be at the train station for an early morn) when all I did was reach out to see if they had it.

The hotel is on the top floors of the largest building in Tokyo. We were upgraded and given a corner room with Tokyo Tower View. This was a about a 270 degree view of Tokyo. Super amazing view of both Tokyo Tower and Tokyo Sky Tree. Check in was very easy and extremely welcoming. The room was large and clean. Huge closet. Spacious bathroom with all the amenities. Two comfy beds. Small sitting area. Did I mention the view? The hotel is very nice and certainly in the top tier of Ritz Carlton's. The service was exceptional. Someone was always there to help or ask questions to but never obtrusive. Japanese hospitality at its finest. The food was good but I only ate breakfast here. The pool was very nice and does have an adjacent hot tub that you could use without having to buy into the Spa. I did like how the Park Hyatt did give a one time complimentary pass to their beautiful spa. I can not comment on the spa here as I was not going to spend $50 to check it out. One asset to this hotel over TPH was the location. The hotel is attached to Tokyo Midtown which is a high end mall with plenty of places to eat. There is a 24hr super market too. All while being above a metro station. Roppongi can get seedy at night but so is Shinjuku. Seedy in the way that people will try to solicit you for whatever. I never felt for my safety anywhere in Japan. I can't say that I had any affinity to either area of Tokyo though. This is an exceptional hotel with an excellent ""immediate"" location. I would not hesitate to book here again. I did like Roppongi over Shinjuku. Other luxury brands are also located in the Ginza area, but found that area to close down after normal business hours. It is a ghost town after 6pm.  Tokyo is so big with so many sections of town and plenty of places to stay. The Ritz was a perfect place to have a base of operations.

You realize quickly that you are now on the highest floor in the tallest building in Tokyo with Ahhhmaaaazing views of Tokyo below! The club lounge staff were always at your beck and call to pour you drinks, serve you breakfast or cook up afternoon snacks, or in our case arrange tour guides and make restaurant reservations. Our room was right down the hallway from the lounge. The rooms are very clean and modern as you would expect in this building and the large windows allow you to see what is in my opinion the best view from any hotel in any large city in the world! This is a real 5 star hotel! So our first morning we awoke to a 7.2 earthquake that hit Fukushima! I am from California so I have lived thru several large earthquakes and this one was crazy to experience at the top of a 53 story building!! The whole room/building was rolling from side to side and the only thing I kept thinking as I grabbed the handy battery flashlight from the moving closet was this building must be on rollers and theres no place id rather be for this than inside this room! After a minute or two of rocking around i couldn't believe we still had electricity and water and no alarms went off. Everything was good so we stayed in the room for 4-5 hours waiting to see if our tour guide for the days tour of Tokyo arranged by the hotel would be downstairs at the agreed hour of 8am??Well sure enough our tour guide texted us that yes she would be late.....5 minutes late only! Wow ok so its safe lets go explore. The Japanese restaurant in the hotel has a super Teppanyaki service with excellent (and expensive) Kobe beef among other things like a sushi bar. The hotel complex is on top of the Midtown Shopping mall with all sorts of stores and food outlets in addition to a subway station. This hotel is in a ""nice"" expensive area in what is central to all other neighborhoods you might want to explore. We spent every day out exploring including a day trip to Kyoto on the bullet train so our activities at the hotel mainly consisted of daily breakfast in the club lounge (excellent and extensive selections), occasional room service (fast fast fast), and sleeping in a comfortable bed. If you can afford the club level I would highly suggest it and Id suggest this hotel in general if you want extra high level attention to detail expected in a 5 star hotel.

Checking in on the Club Floor after a twelve hour transpacific flight on JAL (an exceptional airline, but that's another story) was efficient and welcoming. The Hotel's aesthetic, while contemporary and incorporating all the modern conveniences, is also very much of its locale. Artwork, water features and floral displays make the public areas inviting. And the views from 40+ stories up are as impressive as you'd expect, when the clouds clear (which, sadly for us, was somewhat rare - but when they do... wow!). In opting for a Club Floor Room, the additional food & beverage amenities provided in the Lounge from morning to evening (refreshed & scheduled to day-part) were some of the finest and most extensive we've ever experienced. Our room (a ""Deluxe"") was spacious, comfortable and well laid-out. Top notch bedding, seating and lighting. And the bathroom, an unqualified happy-face from ""the Missus"" for the mirrors, counter space and illumination options (and yes, the commode is indeed a technological marvel). But what really makes this place special is the Staff! Far beyond simple courtesy (which, in itself, is sadly becoming a rarer commodity), the various people we interacted with really seemed to take pride in their work and be personally invested in providing exceptional service! To the men at the door (who never failed to inquire whether we needed directions/transport/umbrellas as we went out), to the Concierges (who provided us with insightful & practical guidance and well-recommended restaurant reservations) to the teams at the various Lounges and Desks (who invariably greeted us with smiles and seemed truly interested in our experiences and assisting us) - may we say ""Domo Arigato Gozaimasu""! Our stay at the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo was one of the best hotel experiences we've had to date!

The room is beautiful and very spacious with a huge bathroom with two separate sinks. The city view is beautiful at night. We were welcomed with some goodies (chocolates) in the room. It's everything we expected from a 5 star hotel.Service:The concierge and personnel are very attentive. We were greeted every time we pass by them. We wanted to visit Karuizawa during the day. The lady at the concierge not only provided us with useful information (e.g. type of clothes we need to wear, train schedule) but also printed out the train schedule with all of the available trains to and from Karuizawa. We really appreciate it as it was a bit of a challenge for us to see which train we could take without a reserved seat.Location:The hotel is located in Roppongi, which is a nice area. The neighborhood has lots of restaurants (e.g. Ichiran ramen). It's also conveniently located right above the metro line (Marunouchi Line, Hibiya Line) and Toei Line station (Oedo Line), though it was a bit confusing at first when exiting the metro and trying to find the hotel. Just follow the sign of the hotel or ask someone. For us, I believe that Ginza has more to do and to see than Roppongi. However, Ginza is just a few stations away. If you arrive at Haneda Airport, just take the Tokyo Monorail (Pasmo/Suica card) to Hamamatsucho. Get out of the station and exit the building. Look for the Oedo underground entrance at the crossing. Take the Oedo Line train to Roppongi. It's very convenient. Airport coaches are only available from Narita to Roppongi but not from Haneda to Roppongi. Of course, you can always take a taxi. We just like to do what the locals do, so we took the metro. It's more fun.","Stockholm, Sweden","ResaViajero</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",53,5.0

Club access is a wonderful add-on here. There is always someone to answer questions, or help with arrangements (important in Japan). It was a delight to sit at a private window table, sip a glass of wine and watch the sunset behind Mt. Fuji at day's end. Staff at the club are gracious to a fault and all speak excellent english. They were a big help confirming arrangements and finding off-the-beaten path locations. Club food offerings vary during the day including made-to-order eggs in the AM and Udon in the evening. The bar offers (complimentary) premium liquor and well selected wine and sake by the glass.Views are outstanding. Room selection is unimportant here - virtually every direction offers an interesting view. The club faces SW, so those in search of variety might opt for an east facing room. Aside from a handful of suites, most rooms are of comparable size and layout. Furnishings are tasteful, comfortable and in excellent conditions. Elevators seem to arrive the moment you approach them.I dined in Hinokizaka three times - twice in the Sushi room and once for tempura. The meals were uniformly excellent. Where else in the world can you have such an outstanding view from the sushi bar? Staff quickly recognized me and was incredibly attentive without being cloying. Not cheap, but the combination of view, quality and service made dining here an appropriate value. The Tokyo subway is a 5 minute walk through the attached Galleria mall and Midtown Tower complex. Get a Suica card on arrival at Narita - essential for smooth travel throughout the subway system.I've stayed at 4-5 star hotels around the globe and this is one of my favorites.","Kyoto, Japan","windance</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kyoto, Japan</strong>",161,5.0

The property's features and views, the politeness of the staff, the kitcken creations perfectly fit with the expectations I had from this brand.OVERALL IMPRESSION: lively and warm luxury. I guess that the Management is leading the collaborators with ambition and passion: they really care.ROOM: a corner suite with superb woodwork walls, a large bathroom with fully satisfactory amentities. Many details to be praised, including furnitures.LOBBY-RESTAURANTS: High ceiling (equivalent to 3-4 floors?); the lobby is lively, with a combination of both warm and bright colours. Views are spectacular, as in high rise hotels. At night the central stage delivers fine music. I had dinner in the main bar and was truly satisfied -excellent pastas and fish. The bar area has a wonderful layout -worth a visit. It faces Shinjuku.COMPARISON with PARK HYATT: Ritz-Carlton wins, to my opinion: better views (it's located between Tokyo/Ginza and Shinjuku and you can admire both skylines); better lobby area (more lively -the music stage is part of the lobby, while in Park Hyatt you have to walk to a separate site, the famous and surely appealing New York bar). Probably the pool is better at Park Hyatt -the Ritz Carlton's looks more elegant and modern, but is somehow less spectacular.The Park Hyatt benefits a lot from the ""Lost in Translation"" aura; but it may even be forced not to chenge, not to evolve from what it was like in the early '00s.

The view from high floor is breathtaking, and you can easily see both Tokyo Tower and Skytree from the lounge at the lobby (so even you only reserve the basic type of room, like I do, can still enjoy this a million dollar scene). When the weather is nice and the sky is clear, I can see Mount Fuji from my room.The location of the hotel is absolutely excellent. There are tons of amazing shops and restaurants in Roppongi Midtown, let along three museums are just nearby. The amenities in the guest rooms are really in good quality. But the most impressive part is the service. Everyone in the hotel greeted me with warm and big smiles. The adorable staff, Ai chan, who works in the restaurant Hinokizaka, were absolutely the most kind staff I had ever met so far in Tokyo.

Roppongi also well located in between the Maronouchi area where I had a lot of meetings, and the Shinjuku/Shibuya area where I always enjoy exploring.My one complaint is I asked the concierge for suggestions for a Teppanyaki place nearby and they sent me somewhere that I felt was not particularly good and was overpriced (Kisentei). I did ask for a nearby restaurant, and this wasn’t on the Ritz’s standard recommendation list, but I was not impressed with the food and wish the Concierge had suggested I went to the Teppanyaki at the hotel which I heard was very good! I also asked for suggestions of things to do while in Tokyo and there list was extremely generic. Basically visiting all the standard sights. I felt they could have been a bit more inventive. However, when I asked them to make specific reservations they were very helpful so not all critical here.I have stayed in Tokyo for business at a number of the top hotels and I would definitely go back to the Ritz. The only hotel that I have stayed at that I think is a class above is the Mandarin Oriental. Others including the Conrad, Four Seasons, Peninsula and Grand Hyatt are comparable.

I've stayed at hotels that are over priced because of location or name. This hotel is worth its high price.I highly recommend paying extra to upgrade to the Club Lounge. The Lounge is exquisite, comparable to a very high end restaurant. The food and drinks they serve throughout the day are amazing. The only regret is that because it was so nice, I didn't explore as many restaurants throughout the city, because the Lounge was so nice.The room was amazing, everything from its size (so much larger than your standard typical hotel room). Larger than other Ritz Carlton's I've stayed at too. The amenities within the newly renovated rooms make this so luxurious. The bathroom is so spacious with massive double sinks. The beds are extremely comfortable.The hotel occupies the 45th thru 53rd floors. It's one of the tallest buildings in Tokyo. Needless to say the views are quite amazing. Both daytime and nighttime panoramic views of all the major sights can be seen, as well as Tokyo Harbor.I could go on and on, but I must mention the staff at this hotel are top notch. From the moment you arrive, and throughout your stay they treat you like you're the King & Queen. They go beyond what you would normally expect even at a top tier hotel like the Ritz. I had a early morning flight (day trip to Northern Japan for a meeting). The night before I asked the concierge simply how early I would need to leave the hotel for an early AM flight the following day. They then went 1-step ahead and since I had to leave before the Club Lounge opened for breakfast (and without me asking or requesting), they had coffee and breakfast specially brought to my room before I had to leave early.

A fantastic stay for many reasons. Location cannot be beaten, right at midtown with shops and restaurants close by, and the metro a very short walk. Some good nightlife options in Roppongi even if it is a little seedy. Staff and service are superb, everything is smooth and every issue promptly addressed. I needed an iron to press some clothes and it was delivered in minutes. View from the rooms is amazing, I was on the 46th floor and the large window provided a great vista.The room itself was large and comfortable, plenty of space, huge bathroom with separate shower and tub. Comfortable bed, and very quiet, I slept well.Very few negative points. Obviously this is Tokyo and things are expensive. The bar in the lobby is fantastic but beware the prices. I also had a few issues with the temperature in the room - it didn't matter where you set the temperature, the heating and cooling didn't seem to work and the room was a bit warm for my liking. Overall though a great stay, I hope to return.","Sydney, Australia","SeeingIsBelieving007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",82,5.0

The lounge was comfortable, including a number of rooms, and serving a variety of Japanese and Western snacks, drinks and light meals throughout the day. They even provide a high tea in the afternoons that includes sandwiches, sweets, and fresh scones along with your choice of tea. This is all, of course, included in the cost of your room. So, service. The staff was uniformly lovely--warmly attentive, quick to respond to any perceived needs, and very quick to learn your name and preferences. Check-in and check-out were totally painless. My group was seated with cold drinks at a table in the lounge while two young ladies came by and took care of all of the passport and credit card requirements. They returned with keys and our bags were in the rooms when we left the lounge. Housekeeping and turn down service were perfect. Random observations: never had to wait more than a few seconds for an elevator; televisions were huge but very limited with regards to English speaking shows (mostly news shows) so you might want to bring a few DVDs in case you get tired of the view; you don't need adapters for your electronics; the concierge can exchange dollars to yen and the exchange rate was very reasonable and it was very convenient.

In short, all my stays at this hotel were absolutely perfect. I decided to write this review to let my fellow travelers know about how great this hotel is so they can have the opportunity to experience similar great time that I had here. It really made a big difference staying here in all my visits to Tokyo. Well, to give you a little background, I'm a frequent traveler and I have stayed at many hotels around the world. This year alone, I stated at multiple Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott properties in the States and in Asia. I consider myself to have a good attention to details and this Ritz Carlton Tokyo has been really significantly exceeding all my expectations since the first time I walked into the hotel. It is the best. The service was flawless. Everything else (location, bar, room service, room, etc) was as perfect. I tried to come up with things to criticize but I honestly couldn't find anything. I haven't had a chance to try the fitness center, spa or the club lounge yet but I will try to do so next time and let you guys know what I think. I believe all these will be as perfect as everything else in this hotel. I haven't had a chance to meet the management team in person, but I think the hotel's General Manager (John) has been successful in building such a great empire and a team who passionately serve their customers. I honestly couldn't think of any hotel I ever stayed at before where service could be better. Every little thing in this hotel shows how management has been paying attention to smallest details. The front desk personnel that I have been working with in my recent stays (Thea and Ikuko Sato) were both exceptionally professional and accommodating to all my requests. I actually realized that I come to Tokyo not to enjoy the city, but to enjoy staying at this hotel. I look forward to my next visit to Tokyo and definitely going to stay at this hotel.

I'm not sure how anything else will ever compare to this hotel. I have stayed at other places around Tokyo and 5-star hotels almost everywhere...none come even close to this place. From the moment you step into the lobby and they greet you by name to the time you leave and they walk you out waving goodbye, you are living in a different time and place. Immediately,they recognized we were staying on the club level so they whisked us up there to provide us with cold drinks and a light snack while they checked us in. We got in late on a Saturday and stayed around Narita. We got to the RC about 10AM on Sunday just expecting to leave our bags and walk around until our room was ready...nope. (Another side note...I lost my credit card while I was checking in (completely my fault). They even had security view footage to see if someone had taken it. Nope. They felt so bad and it was totally my fault and it was obvious. I never thought they did it but I was curious where I dropped which I do from time to time. I felt bad at how bad they felt..haha)They escorted us to our room and showed us all the features in the room. Made sure we had everything we needed. Again apologized about my credit card...again I reminded them it was my fault and life goes on. Shortly after our bags arrived...We stayed on 52nd floor with the club level on the 53rd. We had great views and didn't even bother with the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building since our views from our room, the lobby and club level topped the TMGB building. Our room was immaculate. (We are actually building a house and going to model our bathroom somewhat from our room there.) The bed was very comfy and the TV was massive which I loved watching even if I couldn't understand what they're saying. Prior to arriving, we had the concierge make us reservations at Sushi Masuda and the sushi restaurant in the hotel (name escapes me but starts with an H- I'll write a review of it separately). This was effortless...And I'll forever be in the concierge's debt for Sushi Masuda. We ate at the Towers restaurant on the lobby level for brunch the first day. They didn't have any tables available since we didn't have any reservations but were able to seat us within minutes. I had the perfect egg and it was just that...perfect. Leon, one of the hosts, chatted with us a bit and made the experience even better. We indulged in the spa and that was unbelievable. The massage itself was the hot stone and it left me weak knee'd from being so relaxing. The hot experience, locker rooms and pool were all really nice.Housekeeping and turn down service was impeccable. They even left me a note to let me know they poured me some water for medicine since they noticed I was taking some allergy medicine. We only enjoyed the happy hour once but ate breakfast there each morning on the club level. Best French Toast Ever....There was an incredible selection of Western and Japanese food. I seldom ate lunch after eating there and stuffing my face. The service on the club level was beyond impeccable. The staff quickly learned your name and whether you wanted coffee or tea or an omelette, etc. They always walked you out and said goodbye.The only disappointing part was packing up and leaving...Somehow they even made that special. The Japanese culture always seems to go above and beyond and yet somehow at this hotel they go above and beyond that. They do this not for gratuity since almost none expect it but they do it because they want to provide a higher level of service. The hotel does just this in so many ways. I wished I had remembered everyone's name who was so thoughtful and helped in so many ways. However, I'm not sure I would have enough room if I had.","Houston, Texas","DERRICK B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",16,5.0

The service is attentive and personal. You truly feel welcome and part of the Ritz family. The staff remembers your preferences for everything from which tea you like to which places you like to visit. The concierge Yukiko Isaka was always happy to help with reservations or recommendations for shopping, sightseeing or dining. She became our local contact for all we needed or wanted. We also highly recommend taking advantage of the taxi card the concierge can provide to any location you need to go as the cab drivers do not speak English. She saved us with the “taxi card” several times. The breakfast at the Towers/Azure45 is excellent. We honestly ate there every morning which gave us all the strength for sightseeing and shopping. Look for Inoue Yohe as he truly loves his job and will make sure your breakfast is perfect. We highly recommend you visit the Hinokizaka Japanese restaurant at the Ritz. The renowned chef Masamitsu Taima is a true culinary artist. Our unagi was delicious and the Kyoho grape blanc mange was like eating grape flavored clouds. The experience is unforgettable. The lobby Lounge bar offers great lunch menu. The bar manager, Maxime Bernard, really outdid all of our expectations. He is a delight. Our strong recommendation after a long trip (which we had) is to take advantage of the spa services. It is clean and private and luxurious. A perfect beginning to our stay in Tokyo. The rooms are spacious with enormous state of the art granite bathrooms. The views are spectacular. The hotel is located in the middle of most of the sights so it is very convenient. We made countless friends at the Ritz in Tokyo. Some of which we mention above. We miss them all and cannot wait to return soon.","Warsaw, Poland","Rafal A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Warsaw, Poland</strong>",11,5.0

Can't go wrong.My wife and I have stayed at several other high-end hotels in Tokyo, but the Ritz-Carlton tops them all. In particular the service stands out, because it feels like the whole staff is there specifically for you. Everybody is very attentive and if you have a question or request, they try so hard to help you, that you almost feel bad for asking.Case in point: There was a little incident where a kid had vomited in front of one of the elevators and although the staff tried to warn her, my wife stepped into it when she came out of the elevator. She wiped her shoes and all was fine as far as she was concerned. However, after she returned to our room, 3 people from the hotel came by to apologize profusely and pick up her shoes to get them cleaned. It didn't stop there either, because when they brought back the shoes, they also brought a nice plate with chocolates and profusely apologized some more. It wasn't even the hotel's fault that this happened.Not only the service was great though.Our room, a ""Tower deluxe room"", was very nice, spacious and well maintained and had a massive 65"" TV. The view was beautiful and that is generally true for the hotel, because it starts at the 45th floor of the building.There is a gym and indoor pool too and they were not very busy (at least not in the morning). In fact, the pool was mostly empty, probably because it has lanes and isn't really a pool where you'd hang out. As a service they can dry your swimwear and bring it to your room. We abused this service a little bit by occasionally handing them some manually washed clothes as well, but they never complained.Breakfast was good. Standard breakfast buffet stuff and you can order an egg dish (e.g., omelet), which is included. Try the ""Perfect egg"", it's excellent. For the hotel: One complaint I have is that by default you don't get a spoon, but oddly you do get two knives and forks. This makes no sense, because for almost every one of the egg dishes you need a spoon. This seems like a little thing and it is, but I found myself surprisingly often having to get one, which was annoying. (We stayed for 3 weeks, thus lots of breakfasts.)The hotel is close to several metro stations and there are always taxis on standby too, thus it's not something you have to worry about either. The hotel is next to a mall with (expensive) stores and a supermarket.In conclusion, we had an awesome stay and we'll be staying there in the future again.","Sunnyvale, California","Remco_Tnn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunnyvale, California</strong>",11,5.0

The concierge lounge is elegant and gracious. They serve at least three different menus per day. The lady who makes the omelets at breakfast is not only charming ,but makes a really delicious omelet. They have a vast array of both Western and Japanese food for breakfast. The cocktail hour menu in the concierge is a bit boring since they do not seem to change it, but maybe they will after they read this review. They have a gentleman who cooks Japanese noodles and maybe he could vary that menu. The bar in the concierge lounge is free and generously includes champagne as well as sake and all other drinks!!!

After accidentally forgetting a piece of my pumping gear, it was almost impossible for me to pump milk out during the flight between NYC to Tokyo. Thankfully by the time I arrived in Ritz Carlton, the first thing that they were able to help me with was provide a space for me to pump even though I was too early for check in to our room. It was a painful experience but having the Ritz Carlton provide the accommodation to me sticky was such a relief. I was in Tokyo to visit my brother and sister in law. They live there, additionally I had wanted to catch the cherry blossoms before they were gone. It was my first time in Tokyo and I was so excited to see everything and eat everything. Walking and exploring was incredibly tiring but at the end of the day, I had a wonderful Ritz Carlton room with impeccable service to come back to. It was a wonderful stay. I didn't get club access but it was ok since there was a Starbucks that I frequented daily right outside of the Ritz while I was there. There were also plenty of food shops in the area and in the concourse.

I wish I had selected the Ritz in both occasions. Between these two, at the Ritz the price is better, the service is much better and the rooms are a lot much better.First of all, the location is so much nicer at the Ritz. It's in a very nice mall called Plaza and you can walk with your suitcases from the Roppongi station to the hotel.The people at the entrance are very nice and welcoming, get the suitcase for you as soon as they see you, open the door for you, get the elevator for you and you always see people if you have a question. At the front desk the check in process is quick and nice and they offer your green tea or water or anything you might want to drink in the meantime.At the Ritz, the concierge that we talked to was great. She always got back to us as she promised. She always remembered our names and was helpful and very nice.One particular person at the breakfast buffet, Iida, always remembered how I liked my tea, always greeted me with a smile and was always paying attention to see if I needed anything even if she was not in charge of the table.At the breakfast menu, I never felt rushed and people were efficient without me seeing them run or unhappy (as opposed to the Park).The rooms are much more superior at the Ritz. Very spacious. Great toiletries. Great bathtub and shower. Nice toiletries. They give you as many as you want (as opposed to the Ritz when you have to ask constantly for them)The bar at the Park might be more famous; however the hosts were snobby and they gave me an attitude when I wanted to go in. And people smoke there. Honestly, it's more the hype of the Lost in Translation movie. I went there only once even if I stayed at the Park several nights because the acoustic was bad.The lounge at the Ritz has a great acoustic, awesome views and the service was impeccable. Nice live music. Nice food. Nice drinks.The rooms are in the high floorsI can only say that if you really want to feel happy to be back at your hotel, look forward to see your room prepared or going to the bar to get a drink and want nice, kind people, go to the Ritz.

I was blown-away-impressed with the level of service and attention to detail this time around. I traveled with my daughter, who is not yet two, and the numerous things that the hotel did to make us feel welcome with a toddler was an experience I have thus far had nowhere else. From the diaper bin in the bathroom, to the welcome cookies placed in the room with my daughter's name on them, to the fact that every single front desk employee seemed to know her name...it was awesome. This is of course on top of the spacious rooms, amazing views, and overall excellent service that you normally expect from a Ritz Carlton. I consider myself a demanding hotel guest (frequent business travel, Platinum Marriott member) and this hotel stay was the best I can remember from a staff-service standpoint. I wish I could remember more names of all the staff that helped...some that I do remember: Leon in the Tower Restaurant was very friendly and very helpful, Yasoshima-san from guest relations left my daughter a thoughtful gift before our departure, and Rieka from guest relations went out of her way to let me know that if I had any needs the staff would attend to them.

And I have to say that both the staff at the Ritz-Carlton, Tokyo played no small part in making our decision.From the moment we arrived until the moment we were escorted to our airport transportation, the bell staff, hostess, and front desk worked together to make sure that our stay was smooth and any requests were quickly met. As we were being checked in, the front desk receptionist asked if we had plans for dinner, and made note of our requests, which admittedly limited our options since my wife is allergic to both shrimp and rice (rice being the big one here!) The coordination between the front desk and the concierge to provide us with dining options was perfect. The choices were all within the walking distance that we asked for, and allowed for us to experience Midtown as we wished.The view of the city from our room was absolutely stunning. So much so, that we spent several minutes just taking it in (and my wife taking pictures, as she is a photographer). The room was flawless to us, and quite spacious. Being Westerners, we had no issues with the size of the room.The only thing I was disappointed with was my not making note of the names of the staff I interacted with so that I could give them proper recognition.

Street level is a long elevator ride away, and the lobby is on the 45th floor. There is a lack in grand entrance what you should typically expect from a grand hotel.

It does a lot very well, but I did have a few small issues.The public spaces in this hotel are ultra sleek and polished. The lobby bar, with its atmospheric jazz music, is a relaxing place to enjoy a drink. Similarly, my friend and I enjoyed the pool space with its hot tub. The location has both strengths and weaknesses. In spite of being my third visit to Tokyo, I didn't realise that Roppongi was such a red light district for foreign tourists. When we were directed to a wonderful Udon restaurant late at night by the concierge, I felt somewhat intimidated by the men on the street peddling strip bars. With that said, this area could easily be avoided by guests who are aware of this. If the red light area is avoided, this is a very central area to stay, and access to the subway is excellent (though not quite as wonderful as the Capitol Hotel, which is above two lines).I was a little disappointed with the room. Unfortunately, we unwittingly booked a twin room (which was our fault), however, we were assigned a room that was clearly designed for wheelchair accessibility in the bathroom. I was surprised we were not told this, and it made the room feel significantly less luxurious. The bedroom space was still modern and stylish. It felt new. I have to admit, we did not complain to the hotel about our allocated room, as there was a lovely view to Tokyo Tower that my friend liked, though I feel that the hotel would be aware that in giving a wheel chair access bathroom to non-disabled clients, the customer is likely to be somewhat disappointed.The market for luxury hotels in Tokyo is dense. Compared to the Park Hyatt, this hotel feels significantly less personable. The room was ultra modern, but felt less luxurious. The location is better than the Park Hyatt, but not as Central as the Four Seasons or Capitol Hotel.

I travel to Tokyo once or twice a year but this was the first time to stay at the RC Tokyo.The room was well appointed and the size was adequate. The hotel's location in Roppongi is convenient although if arriving by subway or on foot, access to the lobby and rooms can be awkward.The room size is decent and on par for upscale western style hotels in Tokyo.Personal interactions with the front staff were good and people courteous an pleasant. Having a greeter in the front / lobby was a nice touch.We had a late night flight leaving Tokyo and at checkout the front desk manager on duty (Ms. Sato?) allowed us to use part of the Spa Spa to clean up and change clothes before our flight. The gesture was truly appreciated.There were some issues though:Two different rooms had mold problems in the shower area. While the problem was dealt with swiftly in both cases, the second instance was somewhat downplayed. The front line staff were helpful and apologetic but we never heard from upper management which is disappointing for a hotel of this ranking with a problem that appeared systemic.The concierge staff were helpful and friendly and in particular my face to face interactions were pleasant. Several days prior to check in I emailed the concierge team for reservations and did not get a reply on that issue. When I enquired, they said they had not received it even though we had several interactions via email.Also, one of the reservations required advanced information to be submitted. I went down to the concierge desk and submitted our preferences but the next morning I got a letter stating that they were still waiting to hear from us.Bell staff were friendly at checkin and bags were delivered without issue. Upon checkout the bellman didn’t bring a cart and was having trouble dealing with all the items since he was alone. I saw suit coat getting crushed as he it tucked under his arm.When at the lower lobby to grab our cab to the airport, the bell staff seemed unhappy that we were using Uber. We were having trouble contacting the driver to ensure he was coming the the Ritz Carlton rather than another location at Midtown.On the last day at the hotel, I had a business breakfast at Towers. My associate arrived before me and asked for a window seat to which he was answered in the affirmative. We met at the front and proceeded to Towers to be told there were no window seats. My associate owns a business nearby and frequents the RC Tokyo so I was surprised his request was overlooked.The food was fine but for breakfast I think I’d give the edge to the Park Hyatt Tokyo.",SF Bay Area,"mongobot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>SF Bay Area</strong>",12,3.0

I have stayed in a few very nice hotels in my travels but the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo is truly in a special class. First of all, the rooms all have magnificent views because the hotel sits atop one of Tokyo's tallest high rise buildings. Secondly, our room was huge by any standard but especially in a city the size of Tokyo. The room was also beautifully appointed, with electric controls for the window curtains at the bedside, a bathroom with two sinks, a bath tub, and a separate stall shower with an overhead rain shower head and two separate and large closets. In a luxury hotel, though, it's always about the people who work there and I have never been treated so well anywhere. People were always interested in our day and wanted to help us get the most out of our stay. As first-time visitors to Tokyo, we really appreciated this and took full advantage of it. Everyone had good recommendations--not just the concierge staff but literally everyone with whom we spoke. Whatever we wanted or needed, the staff was there to help. When I asked about views of Mt. Fuji from public areas of the hotel, I was given elevator passes to the top floor exeuctive club lounge for breakfast the next day. (By the way, this was undoubtedly the very best club lounge I have ever experienced. At breakfast, they had a chef-manned egg station; when I asked for orange juice, I got fresh-squeezed juice, a real luxury in Japan.) The spa, gym and pools take up the entire 46th floor of the building and are very well appointed. And, the hotel sits atop two subway stations and a high-end shopping mall that also has a few moderately priced restaurants. The restaurant we tried in the hotel, Towers, was excellent, too, and they have live jazz in the lobby every night, something I really appreciated after a long day of touring. When we checked out, we were accompanied all the way from the 45th floor lobby to the 1st floor motor entrance by no less than 5 members of the staff. I have never had such a warm and fuzzy feeling about a hotel stay in my life. The place managed to be luxurious and elegant without ever being stuffy. I can pretty much guarantee that you will like the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo.","Seattle, Washington","SteveLikes_3_Stars</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",42,5.0

By RC standards, this hotel is definitely top-tier. Even the entry-level rooms are spacious and modern, with all of the amenities one would expect from a luxury hotel in Tokyo. Service is impeccable, if slightly sterile, and decors is somewhat on the minimalist side by RC standards - a big plus compared to some other properties in the chain that are downright gaudy.Entry-level deluxe rooms don't skimp on space - they're 52 square meters in size, which drawfs entry level rooms in most other Tokyo luxury hotels.A real highlight of the RC Tokyo is its club lounge. It's huge, giving it a less crowded feel, and it's well staffed such that it is not difficult to draw the attention of staff there. It's gorgeous, with great food and a nice bar. If you can get club access, you should definitely do so.There are many tier-1 luxury hotels in Tokyo - Aman, Peninsula, Mandarin Oriental, Shangri-La and the Four Seasons come immediately to mind. In most cities, RC would be a notch below those brands, but not in Tokyo. A great option, including for leisure travellers.","San Jose, California","KI-NRT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",148,4.0

After some confusion on the 1st day checkin I was allocated a corner suite on the 49th floor with a panorama which included the 3 towers - the iconic Tokyo Tower, Skytree and Asahi TV Tower as well as of the Imperial Palace. This provided ever changing views of the city from day to night (see pictures). Breakfast is a worthwhile inclusion and is in the Bistro next to the 45th Floor lobby. The buffet breakfast is more than adequate, and then egg and hot side dishes can be ordered per a small menu. Service is attentive and they remember your name.Also, used the gym on the 46th Floor - this is adequate, but some of the machines are starting to date.

Its location - starting at the 45th floor of Tokyo Mid-Town building complex in Roppongi - contributes a lot to its mystique and grandeur, and a key differentiator to the Grand Hyatt, which is in the same neighborhood, but is more of a ground floor to 20th floor type building. The view is amazing from any room since its higher than any building in the area, and the fact that the lobby is only accessible from a hidden set of elevators deep inside the building, gives it an air of exclusivity. The service is impeccable. The staff are super polite and very efficient. They will bend over backwards to help you with every little wish during your stay. The best part about this hotel is that every room is larger than most hotels in Tokyo. There is ample room for 2 king sized beds, and the bathroom is like the giant ones you find in luxury homes in Texas. There is a separate bath/jacuzzi tub from the standup shower, and the bathroom has ample room for a party. There are lots of free goodies, including a nice pair of slippers that are more comfortable than ones you buy for your home. There are two full sized closets and every furniture is nicely appointed. You can have afternoon tea or drinks on the 45th floor bar - which is a great place to meet people to impress. There are many restaurants - for every taste. The tasting menu is recommended for the Japanese restaurant. Its $150 for one person, but you get a great kaiseki with the best possible view. The only caveat is that all of this comes at a steep price, even for Tokyo standards. You can see from the cars parked in valet that this hotel is frequented by people who drive Ferraris and Rolls Royces. You can find $400-$500 rooms occasionally, but sometimes the only rooms available are $1000+. All the restaurants are also very expensive. But its worth the splurge.

So, I travel to Japan (and of course I dedicate many days to Tokyo) every year to spend Christmas and/or New Year. This last December, I decided to stay at Ritz-Carlton with my family and I can say this was the best hotel in Tokyo I stayed so far.First of all, it is very well located - Roppongi is a stunning neighbourhood, famous because of the very good restaurants and nightlife. Ritz-Carlton is located in the Tokyo Midtown, a huge commercial and residential complex with a convenient and upscale mall nearby. It is also very close to the Roppongi Hills complex, Akasaka, Ginza and Manunouchi neighbourhoods and the Imperial Palace. Besides, Ritz-Carlton is a few steps away from Roppongi Station (Oedo, Hibiya and Chiyoda lines), so you don't depend on taxi/car to move to any part of Tokyo.Rooms are clear and spacious, with a minimalistic-sophisticated decoration, with windows from top to floor that provides panoramic views of Tokyo (all apartments are located above of the 45th floor): from my room, I could see the Tokyo Tower, Odaiba, Tokyo bay and the Skytree, for instance (and since I was in Tokyo in December, I had the privileged view of the Roppongi Christmas illumination and the fireworks at Odaiba). Besides, my room had a luxurious and large bathroom and an walk-in closet.But what made the total difference for me was the Ritz-Carlton staff: very courteous and polite, always smiling and always trying to help and fullfil your needs. Japanese people are famous for politeness, but the attention that you receive at Ritz-Carlton is memorable: you can notice the difference by small things like being received at the door by your name, a welcome letter from the Vice-president or General Manager written by hand accompanied by elegant patisserie as a gift, Valhorna chocolates everyday in your pillow, hot water for tea waiting for you at the end of day.And what to say about exercising at the well equipped gym in the morning, with a gorgeous view of the Mount Fuji, with the support of a personal trainer?Or starting your day with a delicious breakfast, with beautiful pastries made by a talented patissier in-house?After this experience, I became devoted to Ritz-Carlton. I can't imagine a great experience in Tokyo that does not include a stay at this hotel. The only problem is that you will not want to leave Ritz-Carlton during your stay (but please do it - Tokyo is incredible and should be explored day and night).","Sao Paulo, Brazil","insightfulguest</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sao Paulo, Brazil</strong>",8,5.0

Staying in Tokyo's fashionable Roponggi this modern luxury hotel has been recently updated, resulting in a top luxury, extremely comfortable beautiful hotel.The reception starts at the 45th floor, tastefully decorated. As usual the check-in procedure is smooth and friendly. As a platinum member I was upgraded to the next level room on the 49th floor with a gorgeous view on Tokyo Tower. A very spacious abundantly equipped bathroom, comfy bed, Nespresso coffee machine, welcome gifts upon check in and a patient, personalized check in by a hotel staff member, this was a great start. As we were with a family of three, we suggested to pay just for one night Club Lounge access and what a joy that was. Recently updated, the Club Lounge on the 53the floor is even a bit higher than Tokyo Tower, with superb views from all sides on Tokyo city, with an equally superb choice of drinks, snacks and lovely breakfast in a very upscale interior designed space. Great reception by the Club Lounge manager, who after one day enjoying this classy treat offered us to use the Club Lounge service throughout our whole stay. The very tranquil luxurious swimming pool and sauna, great bed, superb staff service, lovely dining, this is what makes a city trip in this huge city so enjoyable. One slight point of criticism if I may. I am a fervent photographer and like to upload my photos each evening on Dropbox. For that you need a PC or Mac to connect my USB equipment with internet. Surprisingly there is even after the renovation, no business center anymore. The Club Concierge kindly providerd me with a Dell laptop that however - through heavy use - was so slow, battery dead in a short time, I wondered how do people like me that bring their iPad and iPhone but not their Mac, get this done. Something to improve I would say. Last slight point I would like to mention is the lack of modern audio equipment in the room. These days people want to connect their video and audio stream via Sonos or Netflix etc. so they can enjoy their own music and music in their hotel room. We had that service in RC Kyoto (see our review). Apart from that, again, a great stay in a great, magnificent hotel.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","TravelGeeks2019</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",137,5.0

There is also a food court where nearby office workers frequent, and a 24-hr supermarket for all your late night cravings. The hotel is just steps away from the main streets of Roppongi, where you'll find plenty of shoppings (Don Quixote, drug store) and even more restaurants (yakiniku, ramen, western food).[Room & Amenities]The room is huge and has breath-taking view of Tokyo City. All amenities are of extremely high quality and standards. [Gym & Pool]Beautiful facility and state-of-the-art equipment but if you have visible tattoos (like me) you might run into some problems. In Japan, tattoos are associated with yakuza (mafia) so many traditional bath/ hot spring places turn away customers with tattoos. In order not to offend some of their (more conservative) local customers, gym staffs asked me to either (1) cover my tattoos with nude-shade tapes or (2) wear a thin t-shirt over my bathing suit. Luckily(?) I only have 2 visible tattoos so I chose to tape them over.

Nevertheless, when we got off our limousine, we were led up to the 45th floor which is the main lobby and transferred to the 53rd floor which is the Club Lounge. Our first interaction is with Ms. Desiree Overhage who sat us at a table overlooking Roppongi Hills to relax and eat while they prepare our check in. The view was breathless! Chatting with Desiree made us feel at home, she was the source of information of things to do, handed us maps, suggested restaurants, really above and beyond when she could just refer us to the Concierge desk who by the way, also at the top of their game as we were able to secure a Joel Robuchon 3 Michelin star dinner the next day. How they able to anticipate our needs is above and beyond our expectations. Our room on the 52nd floor was absolute perfection, waking up to three clear days and seeing Mt Fuji from afar is a sight that we'll never forget. The Ritz Carlton Tokyo website doesn't do justice to what this particular location offers. The staff makes the difference. In Japan, you don't have a category called service, I believe it's completely integrated into what they do. Stepping into the Ritz Carlton Tokyo, there's a sense of hospitality that comes across as genuine , not as part of a training program.

However, as a party of four including our two children 12 and 14, my wife and I were faced with the fact that generally, the hotels in Japan have a maximum capacity of three people per room. When I read the reviews from Tripadvisor about the Ritz Carlton Tokyo, one Swiss family wrote one comment about the Sub Director of Rooms, Hector, who in a similar situation helped that family of four to stay in a room all together. It was 10:00 pm in the In the East Coast in the U.S. Therefore it was 11:00 am in Tokyo, so I decided to call the hotel and requested to talk with Hector, who happened to be working that day and was very polite and helpful. It was the beginning of one of the most wonderful and most gratifying experiences.Hector helped us make the necessary arrangements to stay in one room at the hotel. Because of this, we were able to Decide to visit Japan and stay at the Ritz Carlton Tokyo. Our first day we met Jules Dobois, the manager of restaurants, during our breakfast time and I must say, breakfast at the Ritz Carlton Tokyo is delicious one by offering modern Japanese as well as Western food. Jules introduced himself and dedicated time to tell us about some places we should visit during our visit of seven days to Tokyo. Jules became a de facto host for us every morning and was always willing to visit our table and make us feel special. Later during our visit, we met other wonderful people who seemed to be there to make our visit a memorable one. The concierge desk is one mandatory place to stop for guidance during a visit. The ladies, all of them are so gracious and helpful that it became a pleasure to stop by and talk to them. One special person in the concierge desk is Mariko Ishikawa. She is just such a warm and caring person that it is difficult not to hold her dearest. Mariko and the staff of the concierge desk became one nice and convenient point of encounter before heading anywhere in Tokyo. She made us fell like family and we are thankful for that.Every evening, my wife and I visited the lobby Lounge, where a very nice band with singers and performers who change every night, play American Music, making us feel at home.There we enjoyed nice champagne and drinks and was a point where the four of us, the Rosales Family, spent some evening talking about the experiences of the day or as a very modern family, every one hooked to our phones chatting with our friends in America, since it was daytime here. Anyways, whatever we were doing, the music and the beauty of the salon plus the nice service from the staff made us feel specials. Shiori Iwashido, the manager at the Lobby Lounge was always making sure that were had everything we needed. Finally, Maxim, the manager of the bar, introduced himself to offer service if any special drink was of our pleasure.Thanks to Hector Bustos, who was able to make the necessary arrangements and all of the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Ritz Carlton Tokyo, plus the Japanese hospitality, we enjoyed one of the most wonderful vacations of our lives.","Doral, Florida","Ricardo R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Doral, Florida</strong>",11,5.0

The breakfast at the concierge lounge was truly delightful each morning and the food and service at Hinokizaka was some of the best Japanese cuisine I have experienced. The rooms are first rate and spacious with every modern convenience you would expect at a Ritz in Tokyo. Finally the gym is large and has first rate equipment and a pool. The services provided you would expect at a Ritz resort so very impressive they have them at a city hotel.I also heard great things about the new Ritz in Kyoto and will try that next time I am in town.

Though I have not stayed at any other Ritz hotels, this was probably the best stay I have ever had at a ""chain"" hotel. High class, and excellent service.Originally we had opted to split our time, first at the Ritz and then at the Conrad, but upon arrival at the hotel, after being escorted to the temporary club lounge and experiencing the the service there I quickly changed our reservation to stay a few more days. It was a decision we did not regret.We were staying on the club level, and the deluxe room that we had reserved was far more spacious than we had expected. It had many fancy features and quite frankly I appreciated every aspect of the room including the ""space-age"" toilets, haha. The housekeeping kept our room refreshed everyday and during turn down service.I used the gym everyday and the Ritz gym is definitely one of the better hotel gyms I have been in. I was impressed with the equipment that was made available. The pool looked very sharp but I chose not to partake as I have tattoos and I wanted to avoid any awkwardness.What impressed me the most was the club level lounge and staff. the current lounge is under renovation so they have taken up residence on a lower floor in a suite. Despite this it was extremely comfortable and the 5 times a day food offerings were of very high quality. the breakfast options were quite good although I think I especially appreciated afternoon tea service the most. The lounge always had people there but I never felt that it was over crowded.The staff in the lounge were really good. By the next morning they knew my drink preference and we were almost always greeted by name.In particular, Seiko-san, Katori-san and Hideko-san went out of their way to secure us a hard to get restaurant reservation, very patiently answer my questions about the Sumida fireworks and other tourist sites and even went to buy me some small souvenirs of a Japanese cartoon I was looking for when I could not find it at the store. I was really impressed by their service.Overall we left the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo feeling well taken care of.

The hotel lobby is located on the 45th floor of the hotel. The downstairs staff quickly took our bags out of our taxi and brought them to our room for us. The front staff was helpful, but did not go out of their way to be overly friendly. Upon our visit to the hotel, the concierge was great making reservations for us and incredibly responsive to e-mails, however, once we were there, they were never available to answer any of our questions or to give us directions. The front staff said the concierge would call us up in the room when they were available, which never happened. Every time we went down to them, the concierge was on the phone and could not help us. We were surprised there weren't two people working at the desk or that someone else at the front desk couldn't help us. We were placed on the club level floor, with a room overlooking the city. The room was recently remodeled and was spacious, clean, and had a huge television as well as bathroom! All in, the room and view is what you're paying for! The hotel is conveniently located in Roppongi. There is a subway near by, and the hotel is located attached to a mall with several restaurants to choose from. Upon check out, we were surprised to see on the bill an additional $40 tax each night on the bill. We had stayed in other hotels in Japan, and had never seen this tax before. When we questioned the front staff, they said it was a housekeeping tax, and all hotels in Japan have this on the bill. We paid it, but were definitely surprised to see this additional fee and why it wasn't included in the room rate or at any of the other hotels we had stayed at while on our trip. All in all, for the price you are paying to stay at this hotel, the service needs to be upgraded. They have already upgraded many of the hotel rooms, which are top notch for Japan or any other region, now they need to do the same to their level of service.","New York City, New York","JetsFan85x</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",71,4.0

When we decided to go out to visit Senso-ji Temple, we left our luggages at the lounge. When we came back later at night, our luggages were already well placed in our room! The club lounge is great. There are plenty of offerings. If you are too tired to go out dining, the lounge is a good option. The room is spacious and very clean. The view from room was fantastic.

The entire trip was wonderful, and everyone we met were as nice as they could be. But I do have to say that the staff at The Ritz-Carlton Tokyo took hospitality to a whole new level. Being in Japan, you expect everyone to be pleasant. It's the Japanese way. But when you add the caring and attention to detail you get at a Ritz-Carlton, you get something extra special. The hotel itself was fantastic, occupying several high floors in the tallest building in Japan. The views were phenomenal, the restaurants outstanding, and the rooms perfect (love the heated toilet seats!). But again, you expect that at The Ritz. However, the staff took the time to get to know us, without being intrusive, and especially took a shine to my 18 year old son. They found out that he likes Anime, and the next morning they left a gift bag on our door with a very kind note and several Anime phone charms, one from his favorite show. That was totally unnecessary, but very much appreciated, and showed that our conversation was not superficial but genuine interest. Our last night we talked to another young lady in guest services about Japanese script, and the next morning we found another bag with yet another very personal card with my son's name translated into Japanese characters. Again very much appreciated. Our 2 week vacation had many memorable moments.

I had also stayed overnight in May during an unanticipated layover in Tokyo. I am a lifetime platinum member with SPG and recently was given platinum level status with the Rewards program as a result of my status with United Airlines - so I thought I would give Ritz-Carlton Tokyo a try…My wife and I have previously stayed at other Ritz-Carlton properties, so we are familiar with their service level, but from an overall perspective I have to say that my experience at this hotel on both trips was nothing short of amazing. Location - For the family trip, we had selected the hotel due to the convenience with the hotel being in Tokyo Midtown. The access to a covered shopping center with ample places to eat as well as a specialty grocery store made it very convenient with a 9-month old baby. It is also very close to Roppongi area – including the Roppongi Hills shopping area.Staff – From arrival at the hotel to check-out, our experience was what you would expect from a Ritz-Carlton x 2. The staff was not only very attentive and polite, but made it a point to go out of their way to genuinely make our entire family’s experience special. From our arrival, our family was whisked away to the Club Room by Ms. Ikuko Sato – Front of House Manager and assisted with check-in by Mr. Yoshikazu Katori – Club Assistant Manager. Both of them deserve special mention as their service level was exceptional. After our departure, I sent an email to Mr. Katori with a question and received a response within a few hours – amazing!Club Room - We were not expecting much with the Club Room being located in a temporary location due to a renovation of the permanent Club Room, however the hotel did a good job with setting up the temporary location. The view from the room is fantastic with views of Tokyo Tower and Mt. Fuji.Room – We had requested adjoining rooms with a crib in one of our rooms and got exactly what we requested. The hotel/staff were ready with the crib, comfortable bed linens, an amenity kit, and diaper pail in the bathroom. The size of the room was spacious and allowed our family (4 + 1 baby) to gather in-between outings.Given the above, I am looking forward to my next trip to Tokyo and stay at the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","KumaKato2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii, USA</strong>",22,5.0

We were in a ""Japanese Carlton Suite"" on the 48th floor with views to the East (e.g. Tokyo tower). I'm not sure if the Ritz' building or the Mori tower building sits higher in Tokyo, but either way, with the Ritz being situated on floors 45+, the views here are unparalleled in Tokyo. Just amazing!The entire staff was more than helpful. Concierge helped with dinner reservations at a variety of places weeks in advance of our arrival. Housekeeping staff did great and were very friendly. Laundry service prompt and on point. Club Lounge staff was polite, engaging, and attentive. Bell team was on top of everything (cars, directions) on the ground (always well stocked towel/bottled-water station for early morning runs too). Overall this was probably the most impressive personnel experience I've had at a hotel (Leela Palace in Bangalore, India a close second). Managers all the way through to housekeeping team all had plenty of English at their disposal. So much so that by the end of the trip I'd gotten lazy, and jet lagged, enough that I started greeting folks in English.Special callout to Desiree (Club Lounge manager) who brought an extra level of cheer, graciousness, and professionalism to everything. To top it off, she pulled together translation cards for a few dietary things I wanted to convey to restaurants in real-time. Seira Nazaki, and her partner in the club (forgot her name), pulled a wonderful hand-written card together with common phrases for my son. So generous!The hotel is clearly a big deal for locals. High-tea in the lounge is a popular, formal, thing, and as more informal travelers, we were a bit out of place at times. Others would be making an event out of the experience while we were just passing through kind of thing. That would be my only gripe about the experience... while all the on-site restaurants accommodated our lack of formality with graciousness (thank you), there weren't any less formal locations we could retreat to when back at the hotel. The Club area was the closest thing, but even there most people would dress up.The hotel is also a wedding ceremony/reception destination, so you wind up interspersed with a whole other level of formality (tuxes and gowns) at times. Everything is immaculate and painstaking attention is paid to it all.Awesome bar off of the main lobby/lounge.

Roppongi is a great central location to explore all of Tokyo and this hotel goes above and beyond, everything was outstanding. For those reading this, the Ritz isn’t the most modern in design but it is the most elegant, understated and refined place you can stay in Tokyo. At first I was worried about the location but in fact the location is perfect. It is exactly centrally located and so easy to explore Tokyo via all the subway stations. Buy a Pasmo card and download the Tokyo Subway app, it works even w/o wifi. You can access the entire city within 10 or less minutes.

I spent a few nights there on business a few years ago, and the hotel made such a good impression I wanted to return. I was not disappointed.Room: A standard room with a king bed on the lower floors is, I suspect, much larger than your typical Tokyo room. The bathroom is large by any hotel’s standards. Well appointed and sparkingling clean. Plus the view is wonderful. Roppongi lies at your feet.Service: Stellar. Exceeds expectation at every turn, from room service to the spa staff. In fact, the attentiveness at the spa is almost overwhelming...I’m not complaining mind you. The are just really on their game.Location: Tokyo midtown. Heart of Roppongi. A decent walk to the Roppongi metro station, but not bad. The shopping complex at the base of the RC tower includes a 7-11, pharmacy, coffee shops etc. The hotel is a great base of operations for business or leisure travel.Cost: Oh yes, the cost. It’s a Ritz. You pay and pay handsomely for everything. From the drinks to the room to the food. You are paying for the location and great service. But then again, it’s a Ritz Carlton. If you want service like this at Holiday Inn prices, keep looking.The Spa: I’m not a spa guy, but I loved the well-appointed spa. It’s expensive, but the facilities are nice, the pool is great...very refreshing, and then there is the service...stellar again.The Bar: Nice bar, awesome view, epic scotch collection, and great service. But note that smoking is allowed, and it makes the whole lobby a bit smoky.Bottom line: If you have a bad experience at the Ritz, and you can not find someone on staff to make it right, then I suspect you are very hard to please. Service is not on the list of nice-to-haves at the Ritz, it’s top-of-mind for everyone you encounter. I will return. By the way, I was on the 47 floor during a recent sizable earthquake in Tokyo. The building shook plenty exactly the way it was designed to do, with no detectable problems. The hotel immediately implemented safety protocols and kept guests informed of the hotel's status.","Santa Barbara, California","MrGaucho1987</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Barbara, California</strong>",242,5.0

The rooms are large. The gym is quite decent. The pool and hot tub are lovely. Amenities were fine (the Nespresso machine was my favorite in-room amenity). All as one would expect for about US$650-750 +/- a night for a standard room. The staff is stellar and kind and creative and generally fantastic.The breakfast, while expensive, is varied and delicious buffet on the top floor of the hotel in a restaurant with breath-taking views of Tokyo. Service is attentive and you feel like royalty eating up there whether you choose more American-type fare or more traditional Japanese food, or both. We went there 3 of our 5 days at the hotel we liked it so much. It was a real treat. What's not so hot: you aren't going to be bowled over by any particular amenities--they're all about what one would expect, minus a little. For instance, when we stay at the Washington, DC Ritz, they always put a little welcome ""gift"" of some sort in the room. No such thing in the Tokyo Ritz. My husband is a ""frequent flyer"" with Ritz and even though he's not Black Label Super Platinum Diamond level I just expected a little more somehow. Also some odd choices: for example, irons are not in the rooms (perhaps you can ask for one though--I didn't bother). The lobby is also a let down. It looks enormous and impressive, but upon closer inspection, it is 95% restaurant or bar seating that guests cannot just go and sit in. There are a few chairs near the check in desk and consierge for guests, but they have no view and aren't really set up for you to sit in and relax for any period of time--they are more utilitarian in purpose--not lounge like. In fact, one afternoon we were willing to pay for the $18 cocktails and have a snack so we could sit in the posh restaurant/bar areas with the views, but we were told there was no seating available for us because they were full (its a big place for ladies-who-do-lunch and business lunches/drinks from what I could gather). I found it a little off-putting that no tables were set aside for hotel guests paying a king's ransom to stay there. Given how huge the area is I also thought the hostess might say something like ""would you mind waiting just a few minutes for something to open up?"" Nope. Another odd thing happened at the pool. It was mid-afternoon and empty except for the two of us. We inteded to dunk in the hot tub and take a quick swim, so we plopped our towels and robes down on two chaises on the pool deck and the pool guy ran up to us explaining that those two empty chaises were ""reserved for members"" and directed us to identical chaises further down the row. ""Members"" of what I do not know, but did it really matter? The place was empty and all the seats were identical. For the life of me I have no idea why the guy cared enough to have us relocate. Sort of odd choice in terms of customer relations. Decor was also a bit different than I expected. It is contemporary-ish, but grandma would be very comfortable and feel just hip enough. For example, in the bar area is a water feature--a sort of square pond--with a raised lucite platform in it that a piano sits on that someone plays during tea time. I found it kind of cheesy. Rooms also were tasteful but bordered on stuffy. Bottom line: if you gravitate toward Ritz standards of service and like their type of ""safe"" luxury, you'll like this hotel just fine. If you are more a boutique hotel kind of person and want anything remotely hip, you won't find it here. It isn't a failing of the staff at all--they are top-drawer and wonderful. Its more about the choices of decor, set up of lobby, and lack of imagination in terms of amenities.","New York City, New York","kyle10014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",181,4.0

The woman at the front desk did not offer us an upgrade which was extremely disappointing considering that we were paying $500 for a double bed room a night. She informed us that she gave us a better view of the city. I do not care about views, especially if I stay in a hotel for a week. The front desk people need better training and if the Ritz-Carlton in Tokyo participates in the Platinum American Express Program, they need to get on board with the room upgrades.

I have to point out here that I specified that we were not staying at the hotel but had just booked two spa treatments. All went well on arrival and until the end of the treatments. However after paying and waiting for the elevator to arrive, the spa manager (I presume) suddenly appeared to announce (and in front of the spa receptionist staff who were showing us out) that we weren't welcome again as we weren't guests at the hotel and that the spa is not open to the general public. I was so shocked at the tone, attitude and abruptness of the person that immediately the elevator doors opened, I made a hasty escape. I was made to feel that we had tried to cheat our way into the spa and in full view of all the staff. If I had had my wits about me, I would have pointed out that if she had bothered to look, it would clearly indicate on the booking form that we were not staying there. I had made a point of checking a box that we were not guests just in case.So contrary to what was implied by the manager, we were not ""sneaking"" into the spa to grab a treatment. In addition, I later discovered that there were several amenities available during the spa visit that no member of staff explained to me. Fortunately for my mother, the member of staff who showed her around had explained the complimentary facilities available and she was able to take full advantage of them. Overall a truly dreadful end of which I will not forget.

While I think of my stay as “The Ritz Done Right”, I must warn that it might not be “typical”. I wouldn’t expect the same series of chance and luck to happen again on my next visit, and no one reading this review should assume that it will happen to them. I know nothing of Ritz policies and am only reporting the experience my family and I had at this property.General Overview (I’ll do an in-depth review on the following pages)….From my pre-travel contacts to the moment we checked out, with personalized service, spacious & well-furnished common areas (to include the club lounge) and well decorated/laid-out rooms (with a view that can’t be beat), the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo earned their position as my favorite hotel in Tokyo…. Was it perfect? No. But other than a possible miscommunication with room service and lack of ambience at the pool, it came pretty close. I would stay here again and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to others.In-Depth Review…2 Adults (40’s), 2 Children (girls ages 3 & 7). Travelling for leisure as a wedding anniversary trip.Pre-trip…Communications with concierge and reservations was good. Questions and concerns were handled in a timely manner. We changed our plans a bit and reservations was happy to extend our stay. Before arrival we were informed of an upgrade.Arrival/check-in… The rooms manager at the Kyoto property arranged to have 2 cars meet us at the Tokyo station (1 for luggage, 1 for the people). One of the gents was at our platform waiting to help with luggage and lead us down to the cars. He was aware of my children’s names and used them when starting a conversation with my 7 year old After a 15-20 minute ride we arrived at the property where there were no less than 2 management types waiting to meet us and escort us to our room (Rooms director, Club Lounge director, and I think there was an asst. F&B manager as well). Everyone knew (and used) our names… “Hello Mr. T, welcome to the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo”. We were escorted up to the 45th (?) floor to the main lobby area and then to a secondary set of elevators that took you to the rooms. Upon reaching our room we were given a brief tour and check-in was done with the Club Lounge manager right in the room. All went smooth enough. Passports. Credit card. A couple signatures.Room……There are upgrades and then there are “upgrades”. This was the later type. I was almost in shock to be honest. Corner” Milenia” Suite (80 m2) on the highest floor (53rd) overlooking Tokyo Tower down to Tokyo bay and Odaiba on one side and the Tokyo imperial palace in the distance on the other. Stunning would be an understatement. By far the best view of the 3 Tokyo hotels we stayed in and tied for 1st when it came to room layout. Here there is basically a long hallway that connects the room’s 3 main areas (in order as you enter… bathroom, bedroom, and living room). First impressions and all that? This is “The Ritz Done Right”.Living Room… This is the corner section of the room and it gives the best views. Sofa, coffee table, chair, side table, desk with chair, gentlemen’s valet.They brought in an extra bed for the children and placed it next to the window facing the Tokyo tower (the chair and side table were moved to the side). I had been initially worried that it might make the living room a bit crowded but it actually fit in quite well.A little story that makes a vacation property into a memory…. My wife was laying next our 3 year old in the extra bed (trying to get her to go to sleep) when my daughter turns her attention from the night view out the window and says “It’s beautiful mama” and promptly goes to sleep. In-room guest amenities… Another very impressive aspect at this property during our visit (although I’m not certain at which level such amenities appear i.e. club level, suites, anniversary trip. etc.).Upon entering the living room we found a plate of macaroons and chocolates with a personalized greeting written on white chocolate to my children (“Welcome to Tokyo Sue and Tina”).Bags of children’s goods to include crayons, activity books, children’s cups, and stuffed lions.A chocolate heart with chocolate almonds inside was incased under a glass bell with tea roses. Writing on the plate (in chocolate?) stated “Happy 8th Wedding Anniversary” and there was an accompanying card stating “Happy wedding Anniversary. Have a memorable stay in Tokyo. The ladies and gentlemen of the Tokyo Ritz Carlton”.A great success with the amenities and most certainly the “Ritz done Right”.Bedroom… King size bed. Nightstands with hidden room controls on either side of the bed. His and her closets across from the foot of the bed. Large screen TV across from the foot of the bed as well. Nespresso machine and 3 types of capsules (all clearly marked and described on a card) are located in the bedroom. Mini-bar is located in the cabinet beneath the Nespresso machine.Standard shoe horn, polishing mitt, sewing kit, etc.Bathroom… Large soaking tub next to the window overlooking the Tokyo Imperial palace. Separate rain shower. Japanese automatic toilet. All the bathroom amenities you could hope for in such a property (toothbrushes, cotton swabs, mouth wash, razor, etc.) all nicely arranged in a wooden box. Refilled as used. Children’s soaps/shampoo/toothbrushes were provided and were already in the room without needing to call and ask.Plenty of towels were provided. Robes for the kids were in the room without having to request them.Housekeeping … Everything was replaced/refreshed constantly. Open a toothbrush and another appears in the amenity box. We never ran out of soap or towels. Everything was always nicely displayed & hung properly. Water, Ice and glasses were provided at turndown. Children’s nightclothes were folded and displayed nicely on the bed. Stuffed animal were arranged in cute ways (i.e. sitting on the window ledge looking out the window). Water and water glasses were left for the children and placed next to the extra bed. I had shoes in 3 different colors and left a note asking for another shoe shine mitt. Housekeeping left a cute note back and gave me 2. Club Level Lounge… Located on the 53rd floor (just around the corner from our room). Another highlight of this property. Wonderful views. Spot on personalized service. Good food. Nice selection. Club level concierge is located at the entrance to the lounge. Club staff were quite helpful when it came to helping with suggestions for daily activities, transportation, etc. They would print maps (in both English and Japanese) and other info often without needing to be being asked.Club level director would often come around and ask as to your activities for the day and whether or not you needed any assistance with planning/transportation/reservations/etc.Breakfast buffet had a nice selection. Well presented. Certainly to 5* luxury standards with a few extras thrown in. Egg station is available but may take a bit of time during busier periods (I was quoted 20 minutes one day). We were never in a hurry so the wait didn’t bother us but for those on a schedule you might want to take it into consideration.I was peeling an orange for the 3 year old and one of the Club Lounge staff came along and offered to do it for me. A few minutes later it comes back, peeled, segmented, and cut (he even took out the walls).The girlies somehow ended up with Ritz Carlton Tokyo t-shirts. If they hadn’t been pink I would have asked for one myself. Lol. Either way. It was certainly nice of the lounge staff to do so, and it was another positive moment of our stay.Lounge staff were always very good with the children. From sitting and colouring with them to taking them on little “tours” around the lounge area.. Nice (but a bit of a hassle)…. They have a whole variety of candies at the lounge entrance (and a couple different cookies). It’s a great amenity. I ate a lot of cookies (and I mean a lot). I am not complaining and in no way am I suggesting they get rid of it…but… you parents out there will quickly find out that this is a bit of a distraction when it comes time to actually be eating breakfast (or any other time you’re in the lounge). lolLaundry/pressing… As we had credit for pressing I had them do a sweater and a shirt. We went out and they were hanging nicely in the closet (with a cloth cover over them) by time we got back. Shoe Shine Service… My shoes came back looking nice enough. To be honest, delivering the shoes in Ritz-Carlton paper shopping bags is a bit underwhelming and minimalistic when compared to presentation at the other properties we stayed at while in Tokyo (cloth shoe bags at one… wrapped in tissue and placed into a decorative box at another). Room Service… This was the only snafu we ran into during our stay at the Ritz. Perhaps it was just a miscommunication but the server pretty much rolled the cart into the living room, took out all the food, and left without setting anything up. As my wife and I had salads as starters, I had asked that he leave the hot food in the hot box. Perhaps he took this to mean that I didn’t want him to set it up? At least he came right back with the extra salad dressing I requested. I ordered 4 cakes with ice cream for dessert. For some reason these came at the same time as dinner (versus having us call when we were ready for dessert to be delivered). Needless to say that the ice cream was warm and melted by time we got to it. I guess I could have had him bring them back down but as I hadn’t specified order of service, I decided not to make an issue of it. Oh. My wife and I each ordered the Japanese curried beef which contained only 4 small pieces of meat each. For the opulence of the property itself, I found such portion sizing to be underwhelming and quite minimalistic. We ordered the same thing at The Peninsula and it came with twice as much meat and a half a dozen or so mushrooms.As we were having a fantastic stay I didn’t really want to make an issue of things and mentioned it in passing to one of the lobby lounge/bar managers. Although I had stated that I didn’t want to make a complaint, things got passed on anyways and the room service director tracked me down the following day, offered his personal apologies, and asked me to contact him directly should we need anything further from room service.Pool… If memory serves correct the pool is available for use by children from 0900-1800.While functional, I wouldn’t say that it had much ambience. No candles. No waterfalls. No real design. Of course the views were fantastic,,, but again… the rest of the hotel is a testament to design and grandeur….You hit the main lobby you say wow. You hit your room you say wow. You hit the lounge you say wow. And when you hit the pool it’s more like…. “Oh. A pool”. Water was available in pitchers. Bottled water is reserved for spa “members” (as were a couple of the lounge chairs and a swimming lane).Kickboards and water peanuts are available poolside. Obligatory swim cap will be provided at the spa desk should you not have your own.Jacuzzi is located in the same general area (just a few feet away from the pool) making it convenient to go from one to the other.Entrance…Located on the bottom floor. Nice enough and well-furnished for those times one is waiting on transport. Nice floral arrangement by the elevators. Lobby… The lobby is quite impressive. 2 story ceilings, floor to ceiling Windows, wonderful views, .a 2 story waterfall, floral arrangements, sitting areas, lobby lounge, bar, concierge, main reception. Main Bar/smoking lounge… Japan itself is pretty much a “no smoking area”. So.. In order to smoke you need to go down to the main bar. No bother. I actually like to take a few minutes on my own and don’t smoke around my family anyway. The areea is open yet still intimate, the furnishing are decent enough aethetically and the chairs quite confortable. Service was always polite and Professional. The assistant manager of the bar and lobby restaurant was always quite nice and went out of her way to greet me and take a few moments to make polite conversation. I enjoyed the personal service and of course it was nice to have someone to talk to a bit as to how the day played out.One drawback in having the smoking area in the bar… Manners almost require that you to buy a $17 coffee from the bar (versus bringing a free coffee down from your room or the club level lounge). I didn’t mind this too much. To be honest, with the upgrade I was more than happy to put a bit more money to the property.There was often live music. I remember 3 distinct acts….a vocalist, a pianist, and a small band.Surrounding area…. There is an “upscale mall” with attached Starbucks right out of the hotel’s 1st floor exit.Surrounding area is quite active. Plenty of restaurants and nick knack stores but perhaps not much interesting for a luxury traveler (other than the sights and sounds of course). Each store/restaurant has a hawker out on the sidewalk trying to get you in the door. It was neat to experience it, but it’s perhaps not my favorite area in Tokyo. Check out/departure….. I checked out the night before our departure. If I remember correctly they didn’t ask for my credit card again versus running the bill and having me sign. Transport to my next destination was arranged. Directions to our next destination were given. A small gift bag of candy was presented to each of the children…And a departure gift of Japanese tea cookies was presented to my wife and I.Conclusion……To me, it’s not a question of “would I stay here again” it’s more as to “When will I stay here again”… I will be back at this hotel. I will put aside extra money in order to stay in the same room. Without a doubt I will book Club Level. I will once again enjoy the food, the views, and the service. Heck, I’ll even begrudgingly go to the pool with my daughters (lol). I would certainly recommend it to anyone (even without the added extras that we received).  No, it wasn’t “perfect”, but nothing really is, and they were pretty close to it. Again. I’d put them at 4.85. I took .10 off for the room service incident (I then added .05 for the RS director approaching me personally). I also took off .05 for the less than imaginative presentation of shoes when returned and another .05 for the utilitarian pool area. With all the extras I received, and the fact that my stay exceeded my expectations, I think The Ritz Tokyo deserves to be rounded up to a 5 circle rating.On a final note…. my positive experiences with the Ritz brand in both Tokyo and Kyoto have lead me to book stays at 2 Ritz locations for my upcoming visit to New York (Central Park and Battery Park).","Lausanne, Switzerland","theswissmister</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lausanne, Switzerland</strong>",284,5.0

A bit salty, nothing spectacular, and very overpriced. But what was more disappointing was the ambiance. Given it's Tokyo, you would expect the staff to be exceptional. As the restaurant is in the lobby, we had an unfortunate experience with a screaming kid running around the lobby and restaurant for over 40min. You would expect the staff at some point to say something to the parents. Instead, the staff turned a blind eye and continued to avoid any contact.

We knew that we were in for a treat - we imagined that the Ritz in Tokyo would be a pretty fine start to our 10 day trip around Japan. But honestly, we just could not believe our luck when we arrived at this hotel. We were ushered up to the club level on the 53rd floor and settled in to a table by the floor to ceiling windows. The view was absolutely spectacular. After a wonderful snack of cherry blossom welcome drinks, finger sandwiches and sweets, we were shown to our room. We had a corner room with 2 super comfy beds, which was perfect as we were a family of 4 - lots of room for us and the incredible view stretching out over Tokyo Sky Tower to the marina in one direction and over the city to the new and extremely impressive Sky Tree in the other. Wow!!! We had been in Tokyo a matter of hours, but felt like we'd had these amazing experiences already! Bathroom was luxurious and spacious replete with all the little touches such as toothbrushes, hairbrushes and emery boards encased in the signature silver Ritz boxes. We had 3 amazing days and nights at the Ritz and came back again 8 days later for one more night. We dined at the Ninja Restaurant (highly recommended if you have small boy in tow) and when we got back to the hotel, Seiko and her team had brought a whole cake and individual chocolate mousses to our room, which was set up with a welcome back message on our beds!

The rooms at this property are very expensive, even by Tokyo standards, but I think this is partially due to location. The hotel, part of Tokyo Mid-Town, is very centrally located, and Tokyo Mid-Town is somewhere you can spend a lot of time between shopping, dining, and museums. I am not a big fan of the decor of the rooms, which seems dated and somehow just not as modern/clean as you'd expect in a very modern place like Tokyo. The size of the rooms is generous, and the views from club-level quite nice (you can either face Tokyo Tower or Fuji, but I guess Tokyo Tower is the more requested view). The club has a decent offering of food and beverage, but again, I find the furniture and look to be underwhelming and dated. Service was quite different the two times I was there. The first time, they had fudged the reservation so the room wasn't ready, they were too busy to check us in at club-level, and they literally asked me to fill-out the same form 3 times. It was super frustrating. The second time, the service was much better, but the 2nd time there were also super vigilant about charging extra for every single thing. They charged us extra for all 3 of our kids (one of whom they counted as an adult), and they wanted to charge us $250 USD for a roll-away bed (I successfully negotiated that fee away). Service at the club the 2nd time was very good, and there is a woman named Desiree there that is exceptionally good at client service. I must be honest in saying that I have always preferred Four Seasons, St. Regis, and Mandarin Oriental to the Ritz properties as I feel these properties are notably better at the small details and at service. All this having been said, we enjoyed our stay and obviously liked it enough to return a 2nd time, although the decision to return was based mainly on location. If you go during sakura season as we did, the location is key as Mid-Town has a ton of amazing sakura and places you can actually have drinks/food under the blossoms.",Asia,"dokodemomama</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Asia</strong>",56,4.0

However I did feel that the rooms whilst immaculate looked a bit dated in comparison to other luxury properties in Tokyo (like the Mandarin Oriental or the Peninsula). The rooms however are very large for Tokyo standards and have all the amenities you could ask for and more. One negative part though is that they charge you 7000 JPY to use the steam room and sauna which in my opinion is ridiculous for the price you pay for the rooms. Other properties offer that for free which is what you would expect for a 5 star hotel. The swimming pool was very nice and boasted lovely views of Tokyo as well.

Director of Rooms, Hector, who also seems to be everywhere in the hotel, and does a spectacular job.All in all, the Ritz is a top hotel in a fantastic city.One more thing: if you want an unbelievable massage outside the hotel, I highly recommend Erawan Thai massage, which is about a 7 minute walk from the hotel. One of the best massages ever anywhere. Have the concierge make an appointment for you.","Highlands, New Jersey","Sockster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Highlands, New Jersey</strong>",527,5.0

We could see out to Tokyo Bay.The bed was the most comfortable of our trip. Attached to the hotel was the Tokyo Midtown Mall. It had all the shops you could dream of as well as fabulous restaurants, bakeries and pastry shops. It was also attached to the subway system which made getting around Tokyo very easy with a Pasmo card( the concierge sells them). The hotel restaurants were very good but a little on the pricey side.The lobby lounge has excellent hamburgers, drinks and snacks. It has live music in the evening.

However, I do think the hotel is showing its age and there are definite areas where improvements are needed, especially when compared to other Ritz Carlton and high-end hotels - and I am writing this review comparing the Ritz to other Ritz properties and high-end hotels.My room was spacious with a view of Mt. Fuji. The bathroom was nice and had a shower, a bathtub and two sinks. Amenities are Asprey. The room had a safe large enough for a laptop which is important to me. While the desk offered sufficient power plugs, there were none near the bed – this is essential for business travelers today. Furniture is quite dated.The concierge lounge was perhaps my biggest disappointment on this trip. I must say that service was excellent – I was always called by name and the employees there were friendly, attentive, helpful, and courteous. However, the food offerings were, truthfully, pathetic – especially in the evenings. They were meager, at best. The Ritz should be ashamed – especially given the amount of money necessary to upgrade to the Club Level. One tripadvisor reviewer said they only offered lettuce and crackers – and, stunningly, there really was not much more than that. My advice to those staying in this hotel would be to not upgrade to the concierge level – it’s really not worth the additional cost.  And, finally, wifi was beyond terrible – it was difficult to get a connection and speeds were painfully slow and, as a result, it was difficult to work. In fact, at one point, I considered moving to another hotel because the wifi was so bad that I was unable to get work done. I did call the front desk and the receptionist was apologetic – but I didn’t get the sense anything could be done about it.I do still like the hotel. However, some investment in the property is needed to compete with other high-end hotels in Tokyo. While service is excellent, it is also important that the product be outstanding – and, right now, I’m not sure that is the case. Due to the decrease in quality of the concierge lounge and the wifi, I don’t know that I would stay here again.","Chicago, Illinois","SeeingTheWordFromORD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",204,3.0

You likely even may feel all Ritz properties are similar in their outstanding service. Well, this is indeed true with one exception: The Tokyo Ritz takes that level of service, comfort, and quality to the highest level. Having stayed in Ritz properties globally, as well as other high-end lodging establishments such as Four Season, Fairmont, etc, there are a many aspects of the RCT that differentiate it from the rest:Service: Simply put, it is perfection. Staff from the lobby to the Club Lounge anticipate every need. They are in communication with each other to ensure that happens and stand ready to provide the service and requests the guest needs. They know you by name (a quality essential at this level of hotel) and treat the guest with respect, kindness and a warm smile. I had some unique needs being a US Masters Distance Runner in town for the Tokyo Marathon and had special requirements for food and beverages as well as other essential items as my trip went on and had changing needs. There was not a moment that I did not receive personal attention to those needs. In my opinion, good service starts from the top and the Hotel Manager as well as the Club Lounge Director all demonstrate ""what good looks like"" so their staff clearly sees leadership's example. Best Club Lounge I have ever visited. Rooms: Clean, confortable, spacious and a home-away-from-home feel. Excellent beds, bathrooms, amenities and views. Housekeeping has an eye for detail you won't see anywhere. I know this since I had to spend a bit of time in my room so was able to see the staff at work. Amazing job. Having met the Assistant Director of Rooms, I can see why the rooms are the way they are. The hotel is looking to renovate rooms and they have the right person there to oversee it. Food: Considering my pre-marathon nutrition guidelines do not have me trying some of the great food they offer, what I did have was fresh, delicious, and plentiful. The Club Lounge variety of food throughout the several stages of their day is exceptional. Spa: As part of my pre-race routine, I have a massage at the hotel spa. The staff was excellent and my pre-massage and actual massage was wonderful and exactly what I needed. The facility is amazing, clean and calming. Fitness Center: Very good choice of machines and treadmills. An excellent 24 hour option for those with jet lag and want a great workout at all hours. I found the fitness center to be clean, well equipped and staffed by helpful employees ready to assist. And the views while on the treadmills are amazing.Location: Located above Tokyo Midtown, near the nightlife of Roppongi Hills and the Roppongi Subway Station directly below the hotel, you won't find a better location. The shopping and food just under the hotel is amazing and there is a 24 hour grocery store and a 7-11 for US travelers to get cash at the ATM. And of course, if you read other reviews you will note the hotel is above the 45th floor so the views from the lobby upward are breathtaking. Its unfortunate that there aren't 6 Stars as an option as this would be it. It all starts with the people, as it is irrelevant if the hotel is amazing but the staff isn't. In this case, the staff is the best and anyone considering the Tokyo Ritz needs to simply stop looking elsewhere and reserve your stay here. I know personally, I will be back in February 2016 and I will have stayed in many hotels between now and then and I can tell you now, each will be judged against this one and will be tough to beat.","Philadelphia, PA","arizonawildcat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, PA</strong>",26,5.0

I always love visiting Tokyo but had never stayed here before.Wow. Yes, this place is pricey, though you can score decent deals in the winter, but it pretty much defines the saying You Get What You Pay For. I've been to the Park Hyatt, I've been to other 4 star hotels in the area (the Capitol Hotel is a less-expensive favorite) but if you have the means or feel like spending a few days pretending like you do this is the place to do it.My wife and I stayed in a Club level room - completely worth it, I've read a few reviews suggesting the Club has gone down in quality recently, which makes me think said reviewers are perhaps spending a little too much time in 5 star hotel clubs and need to take a break to get some perspective :) Breakfasts were excellent, afternoon tea was a delight, the service was top notch from start to finish - this is a place that appreciates your business and rewards it. Rooms are large (we had a standard), beds are super comfortable, bathrooms are ridiculously good, TV is nice and has HDMI so you can hook up your own laptop/streaming stick and watch your own TV while you fall asleep.Bar area is very nice with excellent views - I actually prefer the Park Hyatt a little, only because it is a little smaller and has a more intimate feel, the Ritz is huge with high ceilings. Personal preference and not a ding. Food is very good.Roppongi Hills is pretty much in the middle of everything and the hotel is right over Midtown Tokyo complex including several subway lines, making it easy to get around. We had no problem getting to Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Oedu. Rooms are top quality, Western-style for sure (as is the hotel), but that's what it's going for so you can't really knock it, if you want a more Japanese-style hotel there are other options out there. It's the service that really sets this place apart - they have a knack for knowing exactly when they are needed and exactly when to stay out of your way, it's eerie. When we arrived we left the bags with the porter on the first floor and they were in our room before we got up there - a first for me. We had a personal assistant show us to the room and walk us through detail. Every single person we interacted with remembered us as well as details of our day and what we were looking to do. If you are new to Japan or just want to be pampered (the level is entirely up to you) after a long flight this is the place.Oh and the views from the club level are spectacular, morning, noon, and night.

The service level was superb--everyone from the concierge team, front desk personnel, restaurant staff, club level attendants, bellmen, and maid service. The hotel is conveniently located in the Midtown complex, which has many restaurants, shops, a small museum, a high end supermarket, and 7-11 convenience store. The complex is also connected to 2 subway lines. The surrounding area is know for ""nightlife"", and can get somewhat seedy at night on some streets, but still safe.The level of service was exemplary. The bellmen and front door staff were enthusiastic about helping with bags, and they also delivered the bags promptly even before we arrived to our rooms. The concierge staff were so helpful and assisting us with making dinner reservations and with printing maps for us to use when going to our restaurants (we learned that street addresses are confusing and insufficient in Tokyo, and only a map would help clarify directions). The restaurant staff and club floor staff were efficient and friendly. All the staff we encountered were pleasant and genuine, which is harder to achieve at a large hotel.We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant (Towers Grill and Azure) in all but one morning. The breakfast buffet was very well stocked with an assortment of fruits and breads, charcuterie/cheese/smoked fish, egg station, waffles & pancakes, and oatmeal made to order. There was also traditional Japanese breakfast items like grilled salmon, soup and rice. Although expensive, the breakfast was well worth it. The views from the restaurant were amazing.The 24-hour accessible gym was medium sized and adequately stocked with machines. The view was terrific, as expected. However, they did not offer any gym gear to sale (no shirts, shorts, baseball caps), only gym gear for rent. Although we did not swim, the lap pool looked clean and had a great view as well.The rooms were spectacular. Because the hotel is at the very top of an office building/mall complex (I think at the tallest building in Tokyo), the rooms are very high up and all have spectacular views. We had a view of Mount Fuji, and other rooms have views of Tokyo bay and Tokyo Tower. The rooms were very generously sized, and the large bathrooms had double sinks, a bathtub with separate shower, and a separate toilet room. Housekeeping did a terrific job each day and our room was cleaned very well. My only disappointment was that on our first of two stays, it was not clear to me whether the room was upgraded, as I have the Gold level in Ritz's loyalty program which normally has the benefit of an upgraded room. On our second stay, they did upgrade us.The club floor had very good service as well, but we thought the breakfast on the club floor had much less variety than the breakfast at the restaurant, although the evening wines and dessert presentations were good.It is easy to get a taxi from the hotel, and the attached mall had conveniences such as a foreign ATM card-compatible ATM machine, a Starbucks, a Japanese-style food court in the basement, various mid- to higher end restaurants, 2 subway lines, a small museum, a Uniqlo store, a Muji store, and various mid-to-high end clothing shops. The high end supermarket was terrific and we were able to buy snacks and beverages there.The immediate surrounding area gets somewhat seedy in one direction, however. In the evenings, when we headed back to our hotel from dinner, we would be accosted by people trying to get customers for hostess bars. This was a nuisance, but we still felt safe.The room had reliable wifi, and it was complimentary.We would definitely stay there again, and are already looking forward to our next trip.","New York City, New York","ManhattanGuy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",27,5.0

As a solo female traveler, most people advised me that my experience could be mixed in Tokyo, but it was nothing but superb. The Ritz Carlton is located on the 45th to 50th floors of the highest building on Tokyo, so no matter which room you have, your views will be spectacular.Sushi dining at the restaurant the first evening was just excellent. The hotel concierge assisted me in securing a reservation at the Michelin star rated Sushi Masado for my second night. Concierge helped to arrange a full day tour around the city, which in my opinion, is a terrific way to see the city then decide which of the attractions require a second visit. The rooms were spacious and extremely clean. Everything was pristine, from the bathrooms to the windows. They take excellent care of details, and I appreciated that. Thank you for 48 wonderful hours in Tokyo (and free wifi)!Tip: Do try the bagged great tea in the room.

The hotel is a fine movement Swiss watch (with Tokyo kinetics) ticking away at the comings and goings of global Urbanites expecting and getting Royal service and luxury treatment from all quarters of the hotel: Spa, Restaurants and Lobby. The key features are the forever cityscape vistas, as the property is located in a tall high rise building in Midtown. The lobby is on the 45th floor and at any given moment Tokyo City and Mt. Fuji views are breathtaking. Nothing compares. Very high above, nighttime Tokyo is as photogenic as any pablum smeared, rosy cheeked neonate in a bassinet. There are red lights dotting the vista exactly like a red headed, sickly kid with a case of the measles. Special to any camera toting neophyte taking spectacular pictures as if in a (light-show movie) of make-believe. Guest Services are the Ritz Carlton philosophy on steroids as the demands and expectations are endlessly serving a cornucopia of language variety. This is more so true in Tokyo than New York, London or Paris simply because the guest mix is intricate due somewhat to emergent Eastern wealth. People watching is priceless as the world calibrates to the rise of Asia and the meshing of Western economies and methods. The Ritz Carlton Tokyo is at the crossroads of the exciting trappings of East/West capability and culture. Amazing.The limitless amenities of the hotel are detailed elsewhere but the club level suites are a drop dead Tokyo bargain. Staying elsewhere in Tokyo seems thoughtless and silly.

And we needed it.The hotel is well situated in midtown. There are a couple of outstanding and very reasonably priced restaurants w/in minutes of the hotel. The greatest of them all was ""Meat Man"" which may be the most remarkable and fun meal I've ever had. Ippudo is a stone's throw away and has fantastic Ramen. You can also walk to Gonpachi where ""Kill Bill"" was filmed and it's quite the show.The hotel has a wonderful club lounge and Desiree Overhage, its manager, is gracious, professional, friendly and competent. We turned over our 8 days to her and she made our vacation! We had read a couple of guidebooks but were truly at a loss as to how to ""see"" Tokyo and Desiree saw to it that we not only saw Tokyo, but the Tokyo that suited us. Many thanks to Desiree and her team.The rooms are large, quiet, comfortable and at least ours had a fantastic view. We visited the jacuzzi and pool on one occasion and it's lovely (though it sure has a lot of rules!). Happily, I don't have any tattoos nor affiliations w/any gangs so we used it as we desired.Japan is disorienting to a newbie. ""Lost in Translation"" means more to my wife and me now than it did when we left home...in every sense of the word ""lost"". However, we had a great visit and the Ritz was a big part of what made it manageable and wonderful.

So you don't need to go up to tokyo tower or sky tree to take pictures of the city whilst you get it every night of your stay. (Though, Upgrade is needed for views with Tokyo bay and Tokyo tower) Outside the building, you have 3 contemporary art museum (in which 3 of them are known as the art triangle in Tokyo ) and high end fashion malls selling Japan-exclusive luxurious products. The area is well designed in which you don't actually need a map as road sign with English is everywhere in the area. Hotel Transportation :Tokyo is somehow a well planned cosmopolitan and the metro / subway is well developed. And over developed. The complexity of the subway might beyond your imagination that the same station is shared by different subway companies and the map is more complicated than most major cities around the globe. Yet if you manage to do so you can take the monorail and then interchange to Roppongi and further walks for around 5 mins. The hotel in fact offers me the limousine service. It ranges from Rolls Royce to limousine taxi. This does not only help you to go to / from the airport but can also drive you around in Tokyo for your sightseeing pleasure. With the cheap JPY recently, I have no hesitation to enjoy the luxury limousine for only around 100 usd per hour. (However it should be noted that the limousine is actually very limited ; you better book early) Hotel design : As stated it locates on the top few floors of tokyo midtown. It has an entrance on the ground floor but it does not appear like a palace. The rooms (at least on my floor) are located like a maze. The exterior design of the complex might be nice , not the hotel part is not an amazing one. Room: As I travel in solo, I did not make any upgrade for my room. The size is reasonable (and may be a bit large in this crowded city) Yet still, the room is well furnished with a huge size of toilet. Not only does it has separate bathtub and shower, there are two washbasins and sizable toilet TV. (Attached night view from room of 51 floor) Meanwhile I aware that the room decoration is slightly different for two nights during my stay. It possibly depends on the personal style of the cleaner. Dinning :During my stay, all the hotel Japanese restaurants are under renovation. It's very frustrating that I can't try any of those.The breakfast is included in my package. It's in the style of buffet. (45F - restaurant ""tower grill"") The choice of food is not a wide range one and there's nothing surprise me regarding the food. However, what's better than having breakfast while enjoying the view of tokyo bay morning? The service depends on the number of customers. In my first day, the customers there are limited and I always got my juice and tea refilled. But not the second day. In room dining in fact surprised me. The room service menu is quite wide ranged. (Attached with an in room dinning - 3 courses) The quality of food is definitely high, in the standard of room services. Typically, the ritz Carlton special blend tea is a unique product here. Services : Japan is famous for personal service and here's no exception. The check in is done in my room directly. For those staffs who met me more than once, they address and greet me with my last name. A complement should be given as all staffs come inside my room pick off their shoes in the corridor before entering. ( This never occurs in other hotels I have ever been to ) I guess they probably aware that I have changed my outdoor shoes to the hotel slippers. The girl who assist me in check in grab my heavy luggage to the room. (Yes I use the word ""grab"" as she never let my luggage touches the ground even though it's the style with wheels) I feel so sorry as she is so young and small. Thus I give her a big tips. Pressing 9 in the hotel phone would directly pass to someone who can speak your language and assist you. However, as mentioned above there is a problem that this hotel staff is somehow insufficient, it may take a while to answer the call and / or to assist you in person. Like I called for removal of my tray after room service it takes like 45 minutes. Despite this, the staffs are very nice and polite. I would especially like to say thank you to Mr Sakamoto at door bell ; Ms. Tanaka at room service ; and Ms. Yokoyama at call center.Recommend ?It depends on what you need. If you are business traveller, I believe this is better than its major competitor grand Hyatt (same district ; similar pricing), at least in terms of the view. Of course if you are looking for sleeping on tatami to experience the old Japanese style of living then you should leave this page now. (There's actually one or two special rooms with tatami charging a ""special price"" ) Of course, it's would be nice to visit if the Japanese restaurant are functioned again.Fung (2014/09/30)",,William N,6,4.0

I was on the club floor and had access to the lounge which serves drinks and snacks throughout the day. What annoyed me so much was, even though we stayed four nights the same staff member at the lounge asked our name and room number everytime. This happened several times. Sometimes, we were back 15 minutes later, we got asked again. Unbelievable!Service during tea time and breakfast was terrible. It took a while to be served even though some waiters were available, but did nothing. The waiters never asked to fill up coffee or tea. Mostly they were aloof. The food selection was very limited. However, the staff and concierge on regular lounge and lobby were attentive and professional. The last two days of my stay, I hung out at the regular lobby lounge. I'd rather pay than having to deal with snooty staffs in the club lounge - very unlike Ritz Carlton. The room decor is very dated and tired looking. It is a stark contrast from the lobby floor which is nice. On the positive note, the hotel location is great. It's joined with a shopping mall and metro. Overall, I'm very dissappointed with this Ritz Carlton. I wouldn't go back to stay at this hotel. There are better options in Tokyo.

We had a dinner at New York Grill on top of Park Hyatt and the view is very impressive but we did not feel like staying there. We were hesitating between Mandarin and Ritz Carlton and decided for the Ritz.The lobby is on the 45th floor so when you get in, the views are magnificent. The lobby is both cozy and vibrant with very high ceilings, a restaurant, lounge, bar area with live music and all-around city views.The rooms offer spectacular views of Tokyo. They are elegant, clean and spacious. Not our style, but nice and roomy with large and well equipped bathrooms. If you like the Peninsula décor style, you’ll like the Ritz Tokyo style. We no fans of that type of décor but the hotel has many other charms that made our stay there memorable.The service is outstanding. The restaurant was very good. The concierge recommendations were precisely what we were looking for. The hotel location is in the vibrant financial city center where you will feel the energy of the working population of Tokyo. The Starbucks at the 1st floor is a great Starbucks and just getting my usual 5-Shot Grande Skim Milk Latte there is a great experience of the Japanese people. The order is taken with great respect like they all treat people. The order is delivered with extreme care and caution to ensure that you cup is 100% clean, not a single drop of milk or espresso could have tarnished the white cup. And when they put the lid on your cup, never will they touch the mouth hole with their fingers. Japanese people have such a phenomenal sense of respect for others, it drives all their gestures, way of life, driving behavior, something very special and worth discovering. It is only though the little things in life that you do while in Tokyo that you discover them and appreciate how they are and how nice they can be.So back to the Tokyo Ritz Carlton… would we return? Yes we would. We would still hesitate between Mandarin and Ritz, and that only for the restaurants they both offer. The Mandarin has a phenomenal restaurant but it was closed when we were there so we tried the Ritz and we not deceived at all, we had a truly good time in Tokyo there, much more then when we stayed in Tokyo at Peninsula.Enjoy!","Montreal, Canada","Michel N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",119,4.0

The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are spacious, the views are spectacular, the location is perfect, but the staff tops them all. Without a doubt the best service I've ever experienced!At check-in, my wife and I informed them that we were on our honeymoon. They upgraded us to a club-level room with a spectacular corner room view. They gave us a lovely gift of teas to enjoy and sent up chocolates after we were settled. While enjoying the wonderful high tea service at the club lounge we now had access to (note: there was food constantly being served - breakfast, snacks, hors d'oeuvres, cordials and sweets), my wife and I mentioned how much we enjoyed the tea and asked if there was a way to purchase some for the remainder of our round the world honeymoon trip. Helena, who had stopped by to check on us, returned with a handful of various teas for us. These are the best examples of their great service, but not the only ones. From the maid service, doormen, and bellmen, to the concierge and the front desk - everyone was extremely polite, giving, and eager to make sure that we were enjoying our stay.

I had my family with me as they chose to tag along and see the sights of Japan (wife and 10 year old daughter). Pre arrival - the Club Lounge concierge (Katori-san) was absolutely fabulous. Booking sighseeing tours, sumo ticktets and suggesting things for my family to do while I was working - before we even arrived. I can't say enough about him. He also met us upon arrival from the airport - escorted us from the main entrance to our room on the 53rd floor with exceptional views (a corner room with wrap around views) and completed the check in from the comfort of our room. During our stay I cannot give enough praise to the entire Club staff. From Desiree, the Club Manager, to Katori-san, who seemed to be our personal attendant, and Helena another exceptional Club attendant - anything we needed was either anticipated or immediately delivered when ordered. My daughter was doted on like a princess every day and truly enjoyed telling everyone about her daily activities and the sights that she had seen. When we checked out she went to say good bye to Katori-san, and could not find him in the lounge, she was heartbroken. That is, until we arrived downstairs to find him waiting at the car to wish us good bye with a ""care package"" of goodies for her to take on the plane! Absolutely great personal service! And always with a huge smile on his face. My only negative comment on the Club is my disappointment with the food offerings. For the money paid to stay on the Club Floor I would expect more. I have stayed at other high end properties across the world (and even slightly lower rated (JW Marriott, Grand Hyatt, etc) and the food offerings for both Breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres in the Club lounges at other hotels far exceed those offered here. After reading the reviews on this site it appears that the food has been scaled back recently - which is very apparent when comparing to other hotels I have stayed it. That is my only ""negative"" comment, and is meant more for informational purposes. Other reviews have covered the rooms and location so I will not get into those details here. I look forward to my next visit to Tokyo and will definitely be again staying at the Ritz Carlton - I can only hope they go back to the ""old"" food offerings in the lounge.",,Thomas O,2,4.0

Ritz Carlton has everything you could expect from a 5 star establishment - but its the people and little things that happen that makes an experience above and beyond expectations and this is what makes the Ritz Carlton Tokyo a great epxerience.As with all experiences involving human interactions, errors and mistakes do happen and its the revovery and ""after service"" that either makes it or destroys it. We had a couple of incidents at this hotel and the staff were brilliant at recognizing the errors and fixing the issue well and beyond thus turning a potentially negative situation into a positive one. Examples included a shoe polish incident (a bronze coloured shoe returned a patchy black - which was then ultimately fixed to ""almost original"" colour) - a gesture of apology included a complimentary send off in their Rolls Royce to the airport on our departure. A minor housekeeping error - a cleaning cloth was left behind in the bathroom - the housekeeping manager came personally with a bowl of chocolate almonds to apologise. What impressed us was the immediate follow up action and care taken - it wouldn't have been such a great experience had management ignored or not taken any action.As we stayed 5 nights and used the Club lounge, it was refreshing to see that the club lounge staff recognized us, what we liked and our preferences. On our last day, one of the club lounge staff (a trainee intern from Singapore) was so thoughtful as she presented us with a small package which included a selection of the teas that I had been trying each day at the lounge. A small token but very thoughtful. These little experiences made a good one great!

We feel that he truly appreciates guests and did his best to welcome us. i was travelling with my 3 year old daughter and my mom and dad during the second stay , they were kind enough to make special arrangement for us.Food - We had champagne brunch at the tower grill, overall it wasn't as great service as the first time. there was also a mis-understanding of the seating time, they actually didnt inform us on the 2 seatings and later we were informed we had to leave at 12.45pm ( we started at 11am ) and when we asked to start the champagne at 12.30pm-2pm ( 1.5 hr ) they said we only had 15 mins left, anyway, it was also sorted by their restaurant manager in the end.Spa facilities - it was high end and very luxurious, my only suggestion is that : at the pool side, they have 2 lounges that are for members, my mom, dad and daughter were swimming in the pool and wanted to rest at the lounge chairs, all the chairs were fully occupied, apart from the two members only chairs, my mom and dad couldn't read english, hence the mis-communication and mis-understanding, they were upset they couldn't used the two chairs, perhaps it is a good idea also to make it in other languages other than in English, Overall, it was a great experience, we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely come back.",,richandalice,73,5.0

It's easy to connect too as well. I have been to this hotel before for conferences (beautiful meeting spaces)but never stayed overnight as a guest. We stayed one night in a one bedroom suite that was incredibly expensive, 18,000 yen BEFORE taxes and this suite has no powder room. It was OK in size but the smallest suite in comparison to other comparable hotels such as the Grand Hyatt n Roppongi, the Penninsula in Ginza, and the Mandarin Oriental and Four Seasons in Marunouchi. The room was nice and had some nice Japanese design touches like washi on a niche wall and Japanese furniture, but overall was not warm or evocative. The bed was very comfortable and it has all the latest technologically advanced amenities you could name including an automatic flush toilet which we actually really disliked. The service was not up to par with the rooms. In all, I have to say the Peninsula is much better in terms of service and value. The suites and rooms are much larger there and it is a better value. I expected much more for what we paid. I think they were at 100 percent occupancy when we stayed and it was very quiet in the room. Also, this hotel starts at the 45th floor so you have to take 2 banks of elevators to get to your room which is annoying especially when they are busy.

We stayed here Mid-December after a couple of weeks in Thailand. From minute one, we were treated like royalty. There are too many positives to list all of them, but here are a couple: The room was fantastic, with incomparable views of the city, amazing. Our two kids, aged 2 and 4 loved playing on the ledge up against the windows, no fear of heights with those two. The size of the room was excellent, as well as the exquisite bathroom. The club lounge was fabulous, with a nice breakfast and snacks throughout the day and evening. The location was great, you do not have to step foot outside for anything as the shopping mall and Metro station are all contained in the same structure. What impressed us the most, and we have retold this story dozens of times, is what transpired after my son left his teddy bear at the hotel. On the plane home, my son notified us that his Oreo Bear was missing. Catastrophic images tore through our heads of the many sleepless nights ahead... When we returned home, we indeed confirmed that Oreo was nowhere to be found. I sent an e-mail to the RC asking if by-chance they had found Oreo Bear. I received a response from Toshinori Tanaka, loss prevention at the RC. There was a note and an attachment. The note was for me, the attachment for my son. The attachment was a picture of Oreo Bear and a ""hand-written"" letter to my son. In the letter the bear says that he has been well taken care of, has made many new friends and is looking forward to being reunited with him. Toshinori Tanaka even pretended that he was sending Oreo via airplane and provided his confirmation number and when to expect him. Oreo arrived shortly thereafter, with two RC lion friends for my kids and photos of various places that Oreo had visited with his new friends in Tokyo. If Toshinori Tanaka were a baseball player, he just hit a grand slam in the bottom of the 9th in the seventh game of the World Series to walk off the field with a championship! Many, Many heartfelt thanks from our family to you! This will be a story re-told many times in the years to come and has guaranteed, that anytime this family is in Tokyo, we will stay at the RC again.","Denver, Colorado","ThomasBerg1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",6,5.0

It does not age fast. Some hotels refer to ‘location, location, location’. The the RC, it could be “location, view, comfort night and day”. Of course, choosing the RC means paying the price, no choice. So how do you get it back? I am not going to tell too much on the luxury side. RC is part of these groups with Conrad which compete. What I like is definitively the combination of the view and the location. Even the Park Hyatt has a great view but nothing is close unless you take a cab. With the RC, you are in Midtown, Roppongi. Two massive opportunities for shopping (midtown and Roppongi Hills). And the nightlife(bars, karaoke, restaurants, shows). Well if you like animations here is the place; Roppongi is more recommended for the blend of culture and the cosmopolitanism. For the view, well the worst is to see the Tokyo tower from the 45th floor. With now Skytree built, there is no bad side at the RC(either Mount Fuji with Shinjuku, or Sky tree with ginza or Tokyo tower and the bay or Shibuya). I woke up there once and saw Fuji-san while the curtains opened(automatically); priceless. The service is as expected from this rank. I prefer the New York grill bar at the Park Hyatt though. But the pool is just non-sense. If you swim there, turn your head and you will see Shibuya! Rooms are large for Tokyo standards and well equipped. They have now free internet(not the case when they opened...). Bathrooms are just massive and also a big highlights for those who like to spend time there. As always, Japanese standards call for full amenities so you do not need your toothbrush or shaving kit. I tried the suite; nothing very different apart from the space.Another good place to check is there restaurants. They have a good brunch, with the same view. To summarise: if you want to be in a buzzing place with the view, prefer the RC than the luxury hotels in Nihon-bashi.","Perth, Australia","Live_in_a_plane</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",47,5.0

It was super convenient and a great way to see the City on our way to the hotel. They had a promotion where we got two Metro Tokyo Day Passes when we booked bus tickets to and from the hotel. You can book tickets once you arrive to Narita Airport.Location: The location of the hotel is great! The lobby is located on the 45th floor of one of the tallest towers of Tokyo. Tokyo Midtown is located on the bottom of the tower with easy access to two different Metro lines. Tokyo Midtown was super convenient with a 24 hour supermarket (Precce) which came in handy for mornings when we were heading early to the train station for a couple of day trips and needed some quick breakfast options which we usually bought the night before. There is also a fab French patisserie as well as several high-end restaurants & shops. Lobby: The lobby has superb views of the city with live music in the evening. We had cocktails one evening and really enjoyed ourselves. They had “12 day of Christmas” cocktails, which were fun. My husband asked for their whiskey menu, after noticing their bar menu didn’t have any whiskey on it. They brought us a menu with over 200 whiskeys with great options.

What a shame given their fantastic location, beautiful views, and the potential to be the top hotel in Tokyo. I recently stayed for 7 nights, so I feel the stay was long enough to get a feel for the hotel, service, food quality, etc. I had a western facing room, so on clear mornings, I had spectacular views of Mt. Fuji and the sprawling backside of Tokyo. The views in the lobby faced the other direction, which were more dramatic as you see the skyline of inner Tokyo - but having a view of Mt. Fuji was a treat in itself. Besides these special views, the 30ft ceilings in the lobby on the 45th floor, the perfect location in midtown Roppongi, and always friendly Japanese service, there isn't much else to gloat about.I had room service (breakfast and dinner) on numerous occasions and the food was mild at best. One evening I ordered the Japanese Beef Curry and the beef was arguably the worst beef I have ever tasted - almost to the point where it had spoiled. One one occasion, they told me the food would be ready in 25-30mins and it took 1hr 15mins.The room size is fine (and above average for Tokyo hotels), but they are in need of a facelift. Even the toilet in the room (and I love Japanese toilets) was not as nice as some public Japanese toilets. On nearly ever occasion I called someone within the hotel (whether it was the Bell Desk, Concierge, Front Desk, etc), I sat on hold for at least a few minutes. On my last day, I asked for a late checkout of 2pm and was told there would be a charge for it. I understand if hotels are completely booked and need to abide by a standard checkout time to ensure guests have a room upon check-in, but this was not the case. Loyal clients stay at Ritz Carlton hotels b/c they expect exemplary service, and I did not feel the hotel provided it this trip.Regarding the location, there is a sizable 4-story mall just below the building that holds a wide array of clothing stores, food court, and even a Dean & Deluca. In conclusion, it is obviously a nice hotel with a superb location, but it is arguably the weakest Ritz I have stayed in and they need to do a better job all around to bring the hotel up to the standard of the hotel brand.",elysium246,"elysium246</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>elysium246</strong>",52,3.0

As I walked into the room, the bathroom door was wide open and saw on a chrome mirror shiny pillar a 15 inch hand mark with either hair gel or moisturising cream, probably at 7ft hight where housekeeper had missed. I got quite bothered but waited until the following morning to complain as I had to dash out. The following morning, I called the operator and I asked for the duty manager to come to my room. The Club Supervisor turned up rather than a manager. He was apologetic and actually quite nice but it gets interesting from here. I asked specifically for the General Manager to reach me as I wanted to talk about my experience. The Club Supervisor concurred and I had checked out. Later that night, I received an email from Ms Mamiko [--] who is the PA to the GM. Her tone was super polite on the surface but really quite rude reading between the lines. She goes ""I hope you would visit the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo soon"" but lacked saying do reach out to the GM's office when making the future reservation. It is a common courtesy to offer such even at a lesser hotel. I would imagine that this lady decided to not bring it up to the GM and deal with it herself but unfortunately ended up infuriating me. I asked for a response but casually ignored.A few days later, I contacted the aforementioned Club supervisor and urged the GM to contact me but had been ignored entirely. It is too bad that the GM and his PA for that matter, decided to completely ignore me since the rest of the staff were actually quite nice except for the chap who checked me in who did not even bother to escort me to the room.

I got to know and love Tokyo when my family lived there during my teens, and all things considered, Ritz Tokyo is perhaps the best hotel in the best location. Its other peers such as Mandarin, Peninsula, Four Seasons, Grand and Park Hyatt, Shangri La etc and their locations of Ginza, Shibuya, Shinjuku etc, have their merits but the connection to the Roppongi subway station, its relative newness (6 yrs) and the most unimpeded view in Tokyo puts it over the top. Obviously it is very pricy but if you had money to spunk this would have to be the choice compared to the competitors mentioned above. Furthermore, if one is going all out, I would definitely recommend upgrading for club lounge access. We arrived at around dusk and immediately grabbed a drink and bite to eat in the lounge. It provided a really dramatic arrival, with the shimmering Tokyo skyline beneath, and Mt Fuji resplendent in the distance. The food and drink selection at the lounge was always fantastic. As can be expected in Japan there was great attention to detail and the quality was amazing. Along with an a la carte egg station at breakfast, the tonkatsu wraps at lunch was incredible. If you aren't looking to splurge, there are many fantastic- and affordable- options in Tokyo Midtown, or even Roppongi Hills. The pool and hot tub were clean and stylish. Guests who don't have views of Mt Fuji or club lounge access should come here or the pool to check out Mt Fuji, particularly as the sun sets on this side. I came here with my mum, dad and sister. The hotel is great for all demographics- businessmen, couples, families with kids, etc. If you want to party it is pretty great too- kind of in between other areas such as Shibuya and Ginza etc. Roppongi used to be the place to go when I was a teen. Its always been pretty sweaty and sleazy but there used to be a good crowd before. Now its overrun by African mafia.Overall, a great choice if you are looking to splurge.

But I must say the service varies up and down from time to time. I have never had any problems with staff being polite and courteous which is the nature of the Japanese people, they are not very responsive to guest's need. This time I must say is different from the past. First of all the check in took forever - at least 30 minutes. I am a Marriott Silver member so whenever I request a late check out and hotel has availability, they always comply and comp the late check out. This time the ""rookie desk clerk"" told me that they will have to charge me for the late check out, I protested politely and told her that as an elite member, I always get the late checkout without charge. She then told me that she has to check with a manager who stood next to her all this time listening to our conversation. Without even look at me, he murmured a few words then the clerk told me that they will wave the charge this time. Although I am pleased with the result, I am very surprised how impersonal this manager is. Being a Ritz Carlton guest for a long time, I have never met a manager like him at Ritz Carlton.

Beautiful property, lovely room, amazing bathroom. Very comfortable all around. Really enjoyed the Ritz-Carlton club -- professional staff, very nice food and beverage presentation (though there doesn't seem to be any variation from day to day). I had three service issues that disappointed me and lead me to doubt whether I will return:1. People treat the Club either as their personal conference room (groups as big as 10 or more colleagues working, shouting across multiple tables, running back and forth, etc.) or as their personal space (speaking so loudly on their cell phones that you can hear them at the complete opposite end of the lounge or playing videos on their laptops at full volume). Twice I had to leave and go back to my room because the atmosphere was so bad, but the staff does nothing about this I guess because they're too polite. Ruins it for everyone else.2. Small detail, but it was near impossible to get a cup of coffee. Then, when you finally got one (a small cup) and finished it, the staff swooped in to clear it but rarely if ever asked if you wanted more, so you had to start the process all over.3. I invited new business associates to meet in the lobby lounge for lunch before a meeting. We sat down for coffee at 11:00, knowing that lunch was served from 11:30. At exactly 11:30 we were given menus, and then spent the next 35 minutes trying in vain to order. From 12:05 until 12:20 we tried in vain to get a check to pay for our coffee so we could leave. Finally at 12:20 we walked out, arriving late for our meeting and having not eaten lunch. When I returned to the hotel, I informed the General Manager how embarrassed I had been by this experience. He apologized profusely, but made no offer of any kind to make up for it. Only when I tried to pay for our coffee did he say that he would pick up that charge. Definitely not what I would expect from the Ritz.4. Hit the gym at 7:00 AM two mornings. The first day, the attendant stood talking to one guest for the entire 45 minutes I was there. You could not get his attention. The second day, he did not arrive until 7:25 and there were no towels or other amenities available until he showed up (though the gym is supposedly open 24 hours).","Toronto, Canada","markhroth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",45,3.0

The entire experience was just outstanding. The people at the hotel go out of their way to make you feel welcome and the views from the room, lobby, and club area are just outstanding. The bed was heavenly and the room was very large and comfortable. The included breakfast was very nice but maybe a little more limited in selection than I expected for the price. The location was great for shopping, walking, and connecting to the subway (although not the JR trains). The club floor had nice selections of alcohol and snacks throughout the day. I would say as cool and interesting as the lobby of the hotel was the club area was a little tired and dated. It could use a freshening up but the people working the lounge were so helpful and friendly. I would highly recommend this hotel for a visit to Tokyo. I'm surprised it is not at the top of the list on TA. We stayed at the Westin (which is rated higher than the ritz) 3 nights prior to our stay at the Ritz. The Ritz was much nicer than the Westin (however the Westin breakfast was slightly better).

My husband stayed here for 2 weeks on business while I flew out to visit him for 5 days. The location is in a happening side of town that is more known for its bar and club scene. It's also a bust city area that has mini-malls and restaurants nearby. The major shopping area, omotesando is about 1.5 miles walk. At $800+ per night, we expected nice quality and we found it. Below are my ratings:Accommodations: nice accommodations. Not spectacular but nice. The decor didn't wow me, however the floor-to-ceiling windows in the lobby (on the 45th floor of bldg) and in the club lounge did show beautiful city views. You can even see mt Fuji when it's clear out. The beds in the room were comfortable and the toilet seats were heated. Loved that touch. Club lounge- we had daily access to the club lounge which is where I ended up eating several times per day since I am vegetarian and I would have starved to death in Japan if it weren't for the club lounge. For breakfast, lunch and tea time they always had at least one item vegetarian. The breakfast choices were the best and I'm not a breakfast eater. They had an omelette station every morning, fresh breads, a Japanese station, salad and delicious whole and cut up fruit. The one (and major) disappointment during my stay was a very embarrassing one. One morning upon arriving for breakfast, I wore the ritz-carlton slippers to the lounge. Don't know what I was thinking by 1) wearing them there 2) not researching local custom as I always do before international trips. I was asked to leave (I guess I was considered to be contaminating the room with the slippers somehow, even though everyone wore shoes inside but it's not for me to argue) by the male concierge at the door. Then he quickly stated that I could stay but next time I couldn't wear the hotel slippers there. I decided to go back to my room to change my shoes. Anyhow, I'm not complaining about the custom, I just felt extremely uncomfortable in the club lounge for the remainder of my stay. I almost wish there was a sign at the front of the door which explained what the rules of the lounge were (for people like me that don't quite understand how flip flops are appropriate to wear inside but not slippers that cover your entire foot). Restaurants: never went since there weren't vegetarian options that I could seeValet: very polite and responsive to your needsConcierge: very polite and responsive as wellPool: we went almost every day to the pool and jacuzzi. Would have loved it if it were outdoors, however for an indoor pool it was great. The pool was heated to the right temperature, spa ware was served, and there were very few, if any, hotel patrons or members there. The hot tub was warm. Not too hot, but could have been a little hotter. All in all,except for the embarrassment at the club lounge, it was a great stay. I do wish though that the note, were located in a different area like shinjuku or ometasando, however in terms of closeness to work it was a good choice for my husband.","San Francisco, California","CMB-BOB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",44,4.0

From the moment we stepped out of the cab to the moment we left, absolutely everything was taken care of for us and in the friendliest and most respectful fashion. Even arriving in our nice casual clothes made us feel far under-dressed for the high-end clientele this hotel caters to. It's located in the heart of Tokyo, and is just steps away from many of the conveniences of the city. Being that we are Platinum with Marriott, and were able to use points for our stay, we were given a beautiful city-view room that left no stone unturned. Everything from the lighting, to the blinds, were fully operable from built-in bedside controls. Slippers, robes, and a bathroom full of toiletries made the inconvenience of forgetting anything impossible!Due to the time change and length of travel, when we arrived from the train in Narita, we were quite hungry. We ordered room service and had a lovely Japanese dinner delivered to our room quickly, even after midnight local time. The food was very tasty and the presentation was just fabulous. The staff worked extremely hard to make sure that everything was acceptable. We'd never experienced service like this in our life!

The staff is unbelievably helpful and kind; the views from the rooms (of Mt Fuji, e.g.) are to die for; and the beds are comfortable and the bathrooms large & smartly designed. And everything works! My only other comment, if any, is that some of the furniture is beginning to look at bit worn, even when compared to 2011.

And did I mention Starbucks too.And night life in Roppongi is very interesting too - lots of restaurants and bars.For a tourist, the hotel is well connected via the metro too, though walk to the Roppongi Metro takes about good 10 mins.

Not only did we find this to be frustrating & annoying, but in the end we were shocked & greatly disappointed being that it is a 5 star hotel with a supposedly stellar reputation.I want to share some of the things we observed & experienced, but before I do I want to point out that there were some other reviews that I read & took a mental note of & I wanted to briefly bring your attention to that.One reviewer wrote about how the staff at RC Tokyo were 'pretentious' & how 'they lacked warmth & friendliness' compared to japanese hotels.This is very true although not all the staff are like that. Another reviewer wrote about how they were not 'wowed' by the RC Tokyo. There are times from the moment you walk into a hotel you experience the 'Wow' factor.Sad to say, but we did not experience this here. So here are just some of the things that we experienced or noticed.1)Upon entering the hotel my mother & I were greeted by the bellman, who took our bags into the elevator. While in the elevator he made a comment about how nice it is that the hubby will be celebrating his bday at the RC.There was a moment of silence as my mom & I looked at each other with a look of confusion. She immediately corrected him & made sure he knew it was her bday. This mistake also occurred over the phone with the hotel reservation staff a number of times. Get it right people! 2)We ordered tea & juice one night at the Lobby Lounge Bar. The 3 beverages should not have cost us no more than 5,000¥. Instead we were charged 10,000¥! We paid, but we thought this was strange & were trying to mentally figure out why we were charged so much. Just then the clerk frantically rushes towards us and admitted that she overcharged us because she claims she did not know we were actually hotel guests even though we presented our room card keys to her. Needless to say we got a lot of change back. Make sure you check all your bills & do the math yourself.3)we dined at one of the restaurants on the 45th Fl. It took 2 hours for them to bring out all the dishes. We did not expect to stay there that long. We were so annoyed! To top it all off when we went to pay our bill the lady behind the counter disappeared without letting us know how long she would be gone or why she left. We were standing there ready to pay waiting for her or one of the staff to attend to us. We waited for what seemed like eternity. A different lady shows up after approx five minutes. She offered no apology & acted like nothing was wrong ( or perhaps she was unaware).At this point we let her know that we had been standing there waiting to pay & that this kind of customer service is unacceptable, especially for the RC. She just bowed & apologized. This happened on my mothers bday. Had this employee been on top of her game & thought quickly it was a golden opportunity to turn an unpleasant experience into a positive/memorable one.This is just a brief list just to give you an idea what went down. We paid a pretty ¥ to stay & dine at the hotel. Overall, we didn't have a frighteningly horrible experience, but it wasn't an exceptional or memorable experience either. We were not too thrilled about the hotel or impressed with the level of customer service. We came here to relax & unwind & instead left frustrated, disappointed & annoyed. I wrote a letter about our experience to Mr. Herve H. Chief Operating Officer of the RC. I have yet to hear from him or anyone from the RC. If I ever do hear from them I'll update this review.In conclusion, I would not recommend this hotel unless you want to feel irritated & don't mind paying a fortune for a mediocre level of customer service.",,Informer999,1,3.0

Though the hotel is looking a bit outdated and very uninspired with regards to the room's interior, I think it was renovated 6 years ago, the level of service at this property is unparalleled. The entrance is a bit confusing having to take the lift up to the 45th floor but once you enter it is quite the oasis to chaotic Tokyo. The lobby is lovely, with dark tones and exquisite flower arrangements. You are greeted by the check in staff with great fanfare and offered a welcome hibiscus drink which is wonderful. If you are staying on a club floor they check you in with their designated concierge staff. I cannot stress enough that anyone staying here pay for this service. Food is served from breakfast, light lunch, afternoon tea, cocktail hour and then on to after dinner drinks and snacks. It is worth every penny, as you also get staff who can look after your needs while you sit down and sip tea and scoff scones. Very good wines on offer as well and many other drinks available. The staff cannot do enough to accommodate. The pool was very disappointing and they demand you wear a bathing cap. As it was 39 degrees when we were there, 97F, we really wanted an outdoor pool. The gym has LifeFitness equipment and is very well kited out. The attendant is there constantly offering water, however, don't wear your shoes on the stretching mat, against Japanese custom! Every detail seemed to be looked after and the food on the club floor was very good. The only negative I would say is the room itself lacked character and the beds needed to be changed, as I felt it was beginning to slump in the middle from use.

Went for a night time stroll, so many restaurants, so many interesting people to see. The room itself was fantastic. We had a deluxe room on the 54th facing Mt. Fuji. Unfortunately, too much fog in late June to get a good view of Fuji, but the view of the city was amazing. Definitely a luxury hotel.

Only complaint was the strong cigar odour was not possible to avoid every time we had to go through the lobby. This didn't really affect our appreciation of the stay.

It's massively impressive. We got upgraded to a suite upon check-in and that room was unbelievable. It was so spacious that it was more like an apartment than a hotel room. The view from the windows from wall to wall was incredible. The bathroom comes with two shower heads, one with a flexible hose and the ""rain shower"" one from the ceiling. It has his and her sinks at each end. It also has a TV above the bathtub. One small complaint, if I can make one for this near perfect hotel, is that the shade for the window in the bedroom has a gap on each end, so it lets sunlight in, which made it difficult for us to stay asleep once the sun came up. Breakfast/Lounge ... They had a wide selection of high quality bread and pastries, as well as numerous kinds of fruit spreads. The fruit selection was also very good and fresh. The dessert selection in the evening was also great, including a chocolate fountain with marshmallows, cupcakes, fruits, etc. One thing to note - In Japan, they make omelettes less than half cooked inside, so if you have a made-to-order omelette and if you don't like it runny, make sure to specifically request yours well cooked.Staff ... They were all very eager to accommodate English speaking guests. In fact, we saw a higher percentage of non-Japanese guests than Japanese guests at this hotel. With that and the western style hotel interior, we would often forget that we were in Japan while we were there. While we were checking in, they brought us a shot glass of non-alcoholic mojito, which was very refreshing and appreciated as we'd been exhausted from all the traveling we'd done on that day. We did feel, however, that the staff here were a bit pretentious. They know they're serving at one of the top hotels in Tokyo and they act like it. We'd stayed at Nagoya Marriott before coming to this hotel and we felt that Marriott staff had much more warmth and friendliness in their way of treating their guests, while they were both extremely professional. Location ... It is in the midtown building, where there are many shops and restaurants downstairs. It's only a few minutes' walk from Roppongi station. It's in a busy area, so we enjoyed our walk around the hotel one evening after a great sushi dinner (which had been recommended and reserved for us by the hotel's concierge) to see around the area. Needless to say, the area stays busy and alive until very late at night, so it was fun to walk around and people watch. Overall ... This hotel by far exceeded my expectations.

165252488,https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g14129743-d634263-Reviews-The_Ritz_Carlton_Tokyo-Akasaka_Minato_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto-or1070.html?filterLang=en,"The Ritz-Carlton, Tokyo","June 25, 2013","Before going into a detailed review of the awesome Ritz-Carlton Tokyo, before sitting down and writing my review I purposely waited a month since my stay there to be certain that my glow from it hadn't faded and I am happy to say that it hasn't. So be set for a gushing review of this hotel.We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo for 8 nights using points and from the minute of our arrival to our sad departure, everything and everyone at the hotel was excellent. As many reviews indicated, the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo starts on the 45th floor in Tokyo Midtown, so we were prepared for that. As soon as our taxi pulled up to the 1st floor, we were quickly greeted by a bellman who whisked away our bags up to the Lobby where we were greeted and given a wonderful refreshing drink as we were checking in. We then were shown our room on the 48th floor and it wasn't just any room, it was a corner room that was about 700 square feet in size with even a walk-in closet. The real treat was when our escort hit the button and the automatic blinds opened up to the Tokyo night skyline it was breathtaking! We found the entire check-in process, from our taxi arrival to being shown our room, to be stress free after a 14 hour flight and hour long LimoBus ride from Narita Airport (which BTW, the Limobus is great - prefer it over taking the Narita Express Jr- didn't have to drag our luggage all over the airport). Our check-in experience really set the tone of our entire time at the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo. Room was wonderful and the bathroom (as many other reviewers indicate) was awesome. The room was very, very clean and housekeeping throughout our time there was excellent. Had a daily housekeeping and nightly turndown service. Enjoyed our welcome gift and appreciated the daily bottles of water. Each and every staff member that we ran into were excellent and treated us with the utmost of respect. We really found our room to be great and the view outstanding. Each evening we enjoyed looking out the large full wall windows over the Tokyo Skyline and loved the fact that the automatic shades were blackout since Japan is truly land of the rising sun since it got light at 4:30 am or earlier. (The only minor flaw in the room was the carpet did have a couple of stains near the coffee/tea bar near the bathroom, which I know a couple of reviewers made mention of the room carpets. However, the carpet was very clean as we wore the white slippers the Ritz provides and they were all still white on the bottom after a week of wear.)Location of the Ritz can't be beat. Loved that it was attached to Tokyo Midtown which has a very good variety of restaurants in every price range. One of the best places were liked at Tokyo Midtown was the Preece Grocery Store which is open 24 hours. We stopped by there almost every day to pick up snacks and drinks and a couple of times Bento boxes. Tokyo Midtown also has a lovely public park which was nice to picnic at. We also frequented the Starbucks that is located right across from the Ritz Carlton cafe. It was easy to get to almost anywhere in Tokyo and beyond from the Ritz as it's close to a couple of train stations, including the Roppongi station. As for the Roppongi district itself, it was the only area of Tokyo that I truly dislike as I found it dirty (which is odd considering how clean Japan is) but it's only a few blocks and your through it and we even avoided it a couple of times by walking underground station to station. However, while I think Roppongi is a dump, I didn't feel unsafe at any time. We found the Ritz-Carolton's service to be excellent. While we found most customer service in Japan to be excellent, we thought the Ritz Carlton Tokyo's service stood out a notch above. Had some items laundered while we were there and was handled excellent. Also, we required assistance in completing Black Cat Luggage Forwarding forms as they were all in Japanese and received excellent assistance quickly and easily. (So happy that we stumbled on the Black Cat Luggage Forwarding service which we used 2 different times during our Japan trip with a cost of $ 14.00 per large bag - wonderful not dragging our bags through Tokyo or Kyoto Station!)To sum it up, the Ritz Carlton Tokyo is my favorite hotel ever. My family and I have had the good fortune to travel to a lot and stayed at some great hotels but none tops this one. Now I honestly have to ask myself would it still be my favorite hotel if I had paid $ 500 plus per night (as opposed to using points) yes I would as paid that amount of close to it for average rooms.","Atlanta, GA","Chapsbaby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, GA</strong>",210,5.0

We stayed for one night and the only meal we had was breakfast which was a buffet with good choices. We used the pool which is in a really nice space overlooking the city. There are relaxation rooms connected to this area with hot and cold baths and sauna etc.The only thing to be mindful of is the location. It is directly connected to Tokyo Midtown which has lots of shopping and dining options and Roppongi Hills which is a similar development is also only 5 mins walk away. In between however and in the area surrounding these developments is the Roppongi nightclub district which can be a bit seedy. A lot of regular travelers to Tokyo stay in this area because of its central location and proximity to a number of other areas but something to keep in mind.,,Currypow,23,5.0

It was my first time in Tokyo in over 10 years and we were able to get 5 nights for 200K which given the $500+ charge for the room was a real good deal and I would do it again in the future for sure.However, our stay was a 4 and not a 5 since while the hotel is in a good location and we had a large clean room, there was nothing about the stay that wowed me. I recall previous stays when working in Japan when I found the service exceptional and I assumed that luxury Asian hotel to be better than luxury US hotels but wasn't the case in this situation. For instance, strange to me that for instance at the Ritz in Bachelor Gulch, as soon as you arrive, the valet ensures he takes care of all of your bags etc and you get shown to your room while my wife, and I had to take our own bags up after arriving from Narita after our 14 hour flight across the Pacific. Likewise, there was nothing really special about the room although certainly larger than most in Tokyo but probably overall less updated than rooms in the RC in Boston or Philly.The location is very nice and with the Japanese economy having struggled so much in the last 20 years, I generally suspect that the hotel options have just come down some overall since I worked here in 1999 and 2000. The RC is adjacent to the Galleria area which has good high-end shopping and a nice Indian place if you want something other than Japanese for a meal. A very busy Starbucks is also next to the Ritz. Realize that you are still in Rippongi so if you had left our of the RC, you will be going through the red light district a bit.We did go to the spa floor one day. I passed on the $50 per person per day full spa option and we did the Jacuzzi, swimming pool instead. Probably not a fair comparison but don't see why at a Ritz in the US such as Bachelor Gulch again, the awesome spa is free to use but not here.I will say the concierge was tremendous and got us into the Michelin 3 star Ryugin and also tickets for an opera and a orchestra. They were extremely helpful.So in short, for sure the best (and almost only) Marriott option in Tokyo and if you can use points, go for it but if I were paying next time around, I might at least look at current reviews for the other high end hotels before coming back to the RC.","Richmond, Virginia","rogersb526</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",100,4.0

The service is impeccable, the rooms are amazing, and the location is second to none. If you are looking for a hotel that can truly cater to all your needs and more, you've come to the right place.After the 14 hour flight into Narita, going through customs, taking a limo bus into Tokyo, and a short cab ride to the hotel, it was very relieving to finally arrive at the Ritz-Carlton. We booked the hotel using points, and were able to get all 8 of our nights for free. We knew the Ritz-Carlton's reputation for being first-class in luxury hotels, and so we knew that the hotel was going to be a above your everyday Hilton or Marriott but at the same time we didn't want to bring our expectations too high to the point of a fantasy. However, no fantasy we could think of would possibly come close to the almost surreal palace that the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo is. The first thing you will most likely notice is the impeccable service that greets you upon your entrance into the hotel, as they will insist on taking all of your bags for you. The funny thing though is that the hotel itself really doesn't start until the 45th floor of the Tokyo Midtown building. If you arrive by cab you will then be ushered to the elevator, which wastes no time whisking you 45 stories up. In fact the elevator moves so fast and it climbs so high that it is almost guaranteed that each time you use it your ears will pop from air pressure.Once at the 45th floor you will step out into the lobby, which half the time smells like a manly musk of cigar smoke and orange blossoms. Upon our check in we were greeted with little glasses of a new 7-Up green tea mixture that was a delightful and welcoming treat.Afterwards an employee (named Wada) kindly showed us to our room. As we had been told by Wada, the room we received was not like most of the rooms in the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo. This room was a corner room that looked out high above many of the buildings of Tokyo. From it, given the weather is clear enough, we could see both Tokyo Tower not far away, and the Tokyo Sky Tree looming over the city. We couldn't believe it, but our surprises didn't stop there. The bathroom, as many of the bathrooms at the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo are, was huge. Complete with bath, enclosed room with a high-tech toilet, and a shower that not only has a removable head but all a large rainfall shower head. The closet was actually a walk in closet with motion sensing lights that turned on and off automatically! Thankfully all the rooms have thick black out curtains that you'll be glad to have when you realize that Japan really is the Land of the Rising Sun, as the sunrise is about 4'oclock each morning.The service at the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo is impeccable. You are always greeted kindly and enthusiastically upon entering the hotel, and if there is anything you need don't be afraid to ask as they are more than helpful. When we were shipping our bags to our next hotel in Kyoto via the Black Cat Domestic Delivery Service, we needed help as the forms we had to fill out were all in Japanese. So we called the front desk to see if they could help us, and they immediately filled out the forms, came up to our room, and took the bags for us. Depending on what floor level you're staying will determine will determine how many times your room is cleaned. Normal cleaning consists of a daily cleaning, and a turn down service. However, if you stay on the Club Level then your room gets cleaned three times a day. The cleaning staff is excellent at the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo, for if you turn on the Do Not Disturb button you will find that the staff will slide a card under your door apologizing that could not clean your room and excel your experience. Now how many hotels do that?There are a couple options for food at the Ritz-Carlton, but lets just say the prices are not exactly affordable. Some options on the in room dining are reasonable, but others are not. There are number of restaurants within the Ritz-Carlton complex, but we never ate at them for the prices are pretty hefty. If you are a person who doesn't mind shelling out a good amount of money for your dinner, then you may just be satisfied by never having to leave the hotel to get some food. The location of the hotel is hard to beat as well, for directly below it sits the high-end mall/shopping center, Tokyo Midtown. Don't let the word mall or shopping center fool you though, for malls in Japan are not like the malls in other parts of the world. Tokyo Midtown is 4 floors of bakeries, restaurants, and high-end clothing brands that has something to offer from anyone on a budget to those who like splurge a little. There's even a Starbucks for those loyal followers of the coffee mecca, and a 24 hour grocery and market called Preece. Preece became my best friend while on my visit, for you can grab snacks like bean cakes and crackers, drinks for the room, or even a bento box if you just want to eat in. Everything at Preece, except for the fruit, is a good price. Tokyo Midtown has also just unveiled a complete new stage that they opened back in late April. Part of this new stage is multiple direct underground passages that link you straight to Roppongi Station, which lies right beneath Tokyo Midtown. The station runs the Metro Hibiya and Toei Oedo lines. All of this and the Tokyo Midtown is very easy to get to, for there are two connection hallways on the first and second floors of the hotel that will bring you straight into Tokyo Midtown.Overall. the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo is one of the finest hotels you will find in Tokyo, that offers stunning views, amazing service, and sits in great location that you can use as a home base to shoot off to other locations in and around the city. Or you can just never leave the hotel, for everything one may need is right there.","Marietta, Georgia","Colton H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marietta, Georgia</strong>",12,5.0

Here is the thing: I love sweet potatoes and i asked them but they didnt have any. But the next morning they brought me some steamed sweet potatoes. That little caring detail is something you can expect from Ritz.Lobby bar: What a disappointment. They charge a fee to the hotel guests for sitting at the bar. And the bar is really nothing special.

Check in was professional, if uneventful. Still no one asked to help us with our bags. We pack light, we can handle our bags, but it seemed such a simple miss for the Ritz Carlton to make...The room was large, much larger than our room at the Park Hyatt or in Kyoto. The bathroom was so large it almost seemed silly, but I won't complain about that. The Ritz does little touches well. We were looking at the menu of the steakhouse, and they offered to give us a tour of the restaurants (which are truly lovely with amazing views of Tokyo Tower). We had drinks in the bar each night and the staff remembered us and our preferences. I realize it's Japan, but I was surprised that smoking was allowed in parts of the bar.... that is a bit disappointing, but they managed to seat us far away from the smokers. If you can, make your way to the back of the bar (to the left upon entering) there a few tables tucked away with lovely views.Overall this hotel felt more appropriate for high end business folks than us on holiday, but outside of the arrival everything was of a very high standard. The location in Rappongi strikes me as better for business folks as well.","Seattle, Washington","Mark A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",70,4.0

Our top luxury hotel locations in Asia have been the Mandarin oriental in KL for value, and the Four Seasons in HK for style. Now we happily add the Ritz Carlton Tokyo for service. Hands-down the best overall service we have seen anywhere. No request went unfulfilled by staff from any department and always quickly, with a smile and helpful hints. From the club lounge, to the front desk, to the concierge and the staff in food & beverage, all were world-class and worthy of massive praise. The staff at ‘Roku’ the Japanese cultural gift shop at main reception also gets a heartfelt thank you for their wonderful help; and special thanks to the entire team at the Towers Grill.The room was spacious by Tokyo standards and was impeccably clean, plus had a terrific view. The bathroom was very large. The hotel is not new however, so there is nothing flashy or particularly high-tech about the rooms or general decor. There is a respectable sized pool for such a high-rise and the spa treatment I had was wonderful. There is an odd mix of what you can and cannot access though since some things are reserved for Carlton Club rather than club floor guests or Marriott Gold members. I’ve seen people complain about this and, had I been excluded from something after paying for a club level room, I would have been upset as well (although we were not as these were never full). What could possible improve? Perhaps a stretch, but check-in can be a bit strange and I see in the Tripadvisor.com comments that some were put off by it. It is odd that you walk in the ground floor into essentially a largely empty hallway. No reception area and no immediately visible signage. The one staff on duty when we arrived was on the phone so we wandered around until we found that we had to take the lift to main reception, and then have someone escort us to the Club lounge for club level check-in. More/better signage or staff to escort to the lift would solve all of this. Other than that, PERFECT, almost better than perfect. We will certainly return. Now the 64-thousand yen question….is it worth the price? It’s strange that in an agglomeration of 35 million people, Marriott members have only one ultra-high-end ‘Ritz’ and one ‘Courtyard’ to choose from. No ‘Marriott’ or ‘JW’. Plus, where when you compare what is available, the Courtyard Ginza is a VERY good hotel in its own right. Very swanky for a ‘Courtyard’. Well placed and you can book the largest club room there (massive, with massage loungers and a sitting area) for one-third of what you will pay for a regular club room at the Ritz Carlton. All in all though, the Ritz Carlton service is something that must be experienced to be believed; and yes worth the price.

The staff is wonderful and welcoming. The room was spacious and extremely comfortable and quiet. The views over the city ( the hotel is on the top floors of one of the tallest structures in the city) are astounding especially at night. The Spa and exercise facilities are excellent and well maintained. The concierge staff was very helpful with directions and dinner reservations.I cannot compliment the staff at the Ritz enough. They are well trained and go out of their way to be polite and helpful.The hotel has a number of restaurants and serves a breakfast buffet daily that was very good.We ate dinner in the Japanese restaurant on New Years eve thinking it might be difficult to find a reservation off property. We had a wonderful traditional multi-course meal that was a great experience although it was insanely expensive. Given the holiday I tried not to think about it but when I got the bill it was hard not to feel a bit taken advantage of.There is one other thing that prevents me from giving the hotel 5 stars. I like to stop at the hotel bar and have a nightcap when I travel but the Ritz bar charges a cover for what amounts to standard cocktail lounge music. Even if you sit at the bar for 1 drink you get hit with a cover charge every night. I think hotel guests should be able to enjoy a drink without a cover given that there is no other bar in the hotel. The Ritz is above a complex that includes a great mall with some nice restaurants and access to the Metro without even stepping outside which is a nice convenience.Again, overall I liked the hotel very much and would return but I'd dine elsewhere and find a nearby bar to avoid a very hefty bill at checkout.","Los Angeles, California","bccrab</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",256,4.0

The sushi bar in the hotel is excellent, it was mostly filled with Japanese guests which is a testament to its quality; the price was high but not outrageous, compared with other top-notch sushi restaurants in Tokyo. Like the room sizes and views, the room rates are stratospheric and only for the very well heeled (or us mere mortals on business), plus they are very firm about charging for a late checkout which was an unpleasant surprise to a Ritz-Carlton member.

Also Roppongi is one area of Tokyo that was pretty alive at night so when I stepped out to buy potato chips at 12AM I was surrounded by office goers emerging and going into bars. Also side note - before visiting Tokyo during my research online I was led to believe that Roppongi is not a very safe area - however when I stepped out alone at midnight to visit the convenience store and just take a walk down the main road, I was pleasantly surprised.

The driver first thought we were going to Ritz Hotel, which does exist somewhere in Tokyo. Should had known how to pronounce Ritz Carlton in Japanese.The hotel is a perfection from the moment you step into the GF lobby. Best of all, all staff members speak good English, and the bellhop even offer to file a complaint on my behalf for the not-so-smooth taxi ride. I just didn't want to take that so personally, but 1+ for the attentiveness of the staff.The hotel is also on the upper floors of a commercial complex, just like the Strings Intercontinental I stayed and loved last month. The lobby is on the 45F, and the elevator is so fast that you can feel it ascending and descending with your eardrums... The lobby itself is gorgeous, so is every small details.The check-in process took longer, but I expected already. It is the fault of the reservation system of Marriott.com, that I had to have four different reservations for two rooms for 4 nights (the last 3 were added to the first night, but the hotel was so busy that choosing ""modify"" gave me weird results, so I had to just put down different reservations), and they were busy attaching them together, and made sure that we didn't have to check-in and check-out. Big thanks!The room is so huge in Tokyo standard. It is twice the footage of the Corner room I stayed in Intercontinental in Shinagawa (hence the price being almost doubled). This is only the Deluxe Room (lowest I think), who knows what the larger ones look like... There was no single item in the room not functioning correctly, and everything was just flawless.The Nov 23rd weekend was a national holiday in Japan, so the breakfast during the weekend was quite popular. We had to wait during the weekend to get seated in the restaurant serving breakfast. Not a problem, since the breakfast was so good and the choices were the most adequate among ones offered among all the top hotels and resorts I've stayed in.Although I had my Ritz Carlton credit card long ago, I didn't use RC that often is just because of the value associated. The service and the quality of room is outstanding of course, but the price is really beyond what leisure travelers would like to spend. Moreover, RC being a super 5-star means that it doesn't recognize elite membership as to-the-edge as other Marriott brands. I can be upgraded to a club level in Renaissance just for being a gold member, but club level is excluded from the upgrade of RC (which is totally understandable since club level in RC is way better than just having the title, so there is a cost issue). However, it's hard not to choose something that is also a famous international chain, gives good upgrade to elite members, costs a lot lower, and sits in good spots of the town as well, when paying with your own money.All in all, it is a fabulous hotel, and it was actually fully-occupied for the Nov 23rd weekend.","Irvine, California","zyxlsy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Irvine, California</strong>",75,5.0

I traveled here for business and because everything is so expensive in Japan, this hotel is actually in my hotel cap *gasp*.Awesome factor #1: They care about YOU. I checked in at 12:00am after 15 hours of flying and as soon as I walked up to the front desk, they greeted me by name. What?? Do I have a name tag or something? How did they know it was me? Oh--they actually USE your flight information to anticipate when you'll check in. That's a first. Any time I've provided flight information, it's usually unnoticed by the front desk.Awesome factor #2: ""Ms. sfstef. It turns out that we're out of the room that you requested, so we've upgraded you to a club level suite. You won't get access to the club, but you get to enjoy all the other room services, including housekeeping twice a day for clean up and turn down."" And the incredibly beautiful view of Roppongi Hills and Tokyo from the 52nd Floor of our building.Awesome factor #3: Perfect English 24/7. In Japan, that can be hard... but at a cosmopolitan hotel like the Ritz, it's the norm.I really can't thank this hotel for Wowing me with the experience I had. Not to even mention the perfect location for expats (Tokyo Midtown and Roppongi are high end, businessey, but not overly crowded like Shibuya or Shinjuku. They also don't draw the masses at any point in time... weekday nights are actually pretty calm)I would stay here all the time if I could afford it. But alas, these experiences are reserved for when I'm feeling extra special (or if I can afford 45000 yen a night). :)By the way--the rooms are spotless. Literally spotless.

It is kind of a hassle having the lobby on the 45th floor then switching to another elevator to get to your room but this is certainly customary with high-end hotels in Tokyo in order to get a great view from your room. In terms of modern decoration I wouldn't say it beats Conrad Tokyo but in regards to location it does. The hotel is within walking distance of Roppongi station so theres no cab needed for that part. Roppongi Hills, Midtown Tokyo, restaurants, shops, nightlife, entertainment, etc. are all within walking distance as Roppongi is in the heart of Tokyo. Clearly this hotel is marketed towards the upper class and business but for your average Joe like myself sometimes its good to splurge and treat yourself especially if it's for a special occasion. As a tip, typically you're going to want to put your 'nice clothes on' when staying at high-end hotels as the majority of folks in or around the hotel will be there on business wearing suites. And it's not a big deal I suppose on how you dress if you're just there for vacation but it can get awkward if you find yourself in a restaurant/lobby/shop/etc and you're the only guy wearing a t-shirt and jeans, in my opinion. Free wifi is excellent and fast. In regards to the TV they could really do more to put more of a variety of channels for foreigners or english speakers. Theres 17 'internation channels', 5 of them are just different news channels, 2 of them are the exact same channel, 3 are channels that are still in Japanese, etc. So in that aspect I would like to see more variety, sometimes you'll find yourself in your room with nothing to watch. For breakfast I had waffles and french toast and while it wasn't the healthiest of choices the table tray and condiments it was presented on was pretty impressive, I'll definitely be ordering breakfast again at my next stay. Bathtub in my room was nice but they really need some bubble bath there, I even called services and they said to use shower gel and that it would make bubbles. Well If people are going to pay top dollar for this hotel I think supplying or atleast stocking some bubble bath for the bathtub isn't too much to ask. I wish these types of hotels had a power outlet by the bed so you could charge and browse the internet on your phone while laying down, a tad bit annoying how most hotels don't have it. But clearly those are minor nitpicks, overall I enjoyed my stay there and the location makes it hard to beat.",Misawa Japan,"Travller20</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Misawa Japan</strong>",10,5.0

It wasn't that long ago, prior to 3G that one needed to rent a local mobile phone and beg the concierge for a weird adaptor to download emails on a painful internet connection. Hotels were geared to the local market- and all the better for it - but sometimes disorientating for a Western traveller. Clearly time moves on but the jet lag, environment and climate can still be a killer if you're in town for a couple of days with a 13 hour flight on each end. Happily the Ritz Carlton eases the pain enormously. Yes it's a very American hotel in many ways and yes it's probably a bit 90s in decor (The newer Mandarin Oriential beats it for style stakes) but still retains a very definite Japanese style and welcome. The service is fabulous - not just slick and efficient but very warm and friendly. The housekeeping staff can't do enough and take great pains to make you welcome, almost as if you're a guest in their home. Sounds crazy but true, they take a real pride in what they do. The rooms are large, beautifully appointed and the bathrooms are spacious and lack for nothing. The Asprey toiletries are a treat too! I stayed on a club floor so not sure how different this is but it was great. Wifi was not just free - everywhere in the hotel that I went (room, club lounge, lobby, restaurants) but very high speed. Great mobile phone signal - all the stuff that makes it easy to feel connected to home and settle in and work.The restaurants are expensive - as other tipsters have commented and indeed the lobby lounge is to be avoided, a cup of tea was over £15 - but I must say the quality of the food (both the cooking and the ingredients) was, and I don't use the word lightly - stunning. The breakfast buffet is excellent, with chefs preparing egg dishes on demand to an amazing standard - with a view of the city through floor to ceiling windows that is simply breathtaking. And I guess you have to pay to get food that good shipped up 45 floors!Interestingly, eating off room service was a surprisingly affordable (it's relative term in Tokyo!) option compared to the restaurants with great variety - I ordered a Thai Chicken Curry which was as good as any I've ever eaten anywhere in the world, and a perfect in-room supper.A real highlight is the fitness centre - not just stuck away in some basement (take note Four Seasons Hotel New York, winner of my worst hotel gym in the world award) - a great swimming pool, on the 46th floor with fabulous views and flooded with natural light, and a superbly equipped gym, again with amazing views over the city and plenty of high - end Life Fitness equipment, the same as in my regular gym back home. Someone has clearly thought about how to build a proper spa and gym in this place.All in all, a truly outstanding hotel - a great place to do business from and to come back to after a hot and jet lagged day out and about. Can't recommend highly enough.","Richmond, United Kingdom","marksman122</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, United Kingdom</strong>",19,5.0

I asked to see the suite and was blown away by the incredible views from the corner suite. I calculated the extra cost and decided as much as I loved the suite, it was too much money. The prices advertised don't include tax and service fees the hotel charges. Those are extra fees I am used to in the States but hadn't seen in Japan. I decided against it and was told I could get the suite at price lower than the cost of the extra fees, so I took the suite. I am glad I did. Some amenities in the suite: an espresso machine; very deluxe Toto toilet system, incredible shower system separate from the soaking tub with television and views of Tokyo and the newly opened Skytree, and even a well stocked living room filled with quality magazines and books.It is in a wonderful location with excellent stores nearby, good restaurants, even a next-door cooking school, and the most amazing (and expensive) fruit store I have ever experienced.

The concierge staff is exceptional. Kumiko arranged concert tickets in advance of our arrival into Tokyo. Along with this, she created a concert packet including an article about the performance and English translation on our tickets so we could find our seats! Since we travel one-bag (carry-on only), this means we have to do a load of laundry once or twice depending on the length of our trip. Many of the hotel guests were rock stars, business men, rich woman toting shopping bags, etc. and I was a little worried about the response I might get asking about a coin laundry place. Not only did they completely understand, they had a proper pre-printed map of a local place ready to go...apparently this is common for guests with longer stays.Our room had an excellent view of the city and sunset each night from the 45th floor. The tub was fantastic for soaking weary muscles in bath salts (which were replaced each night) after too much exploring. I also appreciated having separate sink stations in the bathroom, as well as a separate toilet room for privacy. There was a double shade arrangement (on remote) for privacy and then blackout. The lights in the room were controlled by a console on either side table of the bed; there were room lights, reading lights, and even subtle floor lights under the furniture so you could light a soft path to the bathroom in the middle of the night without waking up your partner. The desk was in a great location for being useful, and the room was spacious, well-appointed, and smartly laid out. I also loved the wallpaper that featured tiny fans in exquisite detail. The hotel location was excellent and we had bars, restaurants, and breakfast places (not common in Tokyo!) right outside our door. Best of all, the Hibiya line for the subway stopped right under the mall we were next door to, so getting out to explore was a snap.I would not have enjoyed our visit to Tokyo as much if it weren't for all of the staff at the Ritz and I highly recommend them.",California,"BeeDohBeeDohBeeDoh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",15,5.0

After the long flight from Europe I wanted a luxurious base to explore this fascinating city. The Ritz Carlton sits on the top nine floors of the mixed-used Midtown office tower with 53 floors, currently the tallest building in Tokyo, situated in Roppongi Hills – a lively area with stylish boutiques, clubs, restaurants, the National Arts Centre and interesting galleries like the MA Gallery (This area is more fancy than Shinjuku and Shibuya and much more lively as the area around the Imperial Palace and Tokyo Station, which are a little boring and quiet in the evening).In the small but very elegant entry lobby at the ground floor the bellboys took my luggage to be sent to my room and led me to the elevators whisking me up to floor 45 where the spacious two-story main lobby and the several restaurants are located. Stunning views over the skyline of Tokyo.Because of the location atop the Midtown shopping centre you can reach the subway within minutes and also have a wide choice of elegant shops, bars, coffee and pastry-shops at your doorstep (wonderful variety and quality – as in Paris – but at least as expensive..)The Service:Smooth as silk check in, no problem to check in early and to get an upgrade.The service was faultless during my whole stay – friendly and professional. Good recommendations about sights, restaurants in the area and public transportation through the concierge. The Room:I had a reservation for a Deluxe Room and asked for a room with a view of Mount Fuji, but none was available, instead I was upgraded to a Tower Deluxe Room on floor 48 with a breathtaking view over the south of Tokyo, the bay and the Tokyo Tower through floor to ceiling windows. Later I had a look in a Mount Fuji View room, stunning on a clear day, but these days are rare in Tokyo! So I was very happy with the view of Tokyo Tower, impressively illuminated in the dark. Very spacious room (about 54 square metres), very elegant in the” Ritz Carlton Style” (more “old money” than “cutting edge” – if you prefer “cutting edge” have a look at the new Shangri La or the Peninsula).Gorgeous bathroom, spacious with wonderful large rain shower booth, Flat-TV and the famous TOTO toilet, which at first frightens the European with the many buttons and switches, but after some attempts of trying out, you will love it!As expected in a Ritz Carlton Hotel there is nothing to be missed in the room. Fantastic beds, ample storage space, an assortment of tea and coffee for the kettle, individual lightning, magazines, fresh flowers, fruits and all technical equipment you may need.The Food:Very expensive but absolutely comprehensive buffet-breakfast at the Towers Grill, a very elegant setting affording great views again through the floor to ceiling windows.The best bacon I have eaten in my whole life and an unusual wide fresh fruit selection.Lunch at the Hinokizaka Restaurant (1 * by Guide Michelin) was a memorable experience, but the bill brought tears to my eyes.All in all:The Ritz Carlton Tokyo is a very expensive hotel (expect to pay 650 US Dollars for one night without breakfast) – but it delivers well.Fantastic location for sightseeing with the subway 50 stories below, very stylish public areas, spacious rooms in a more conservative but tasteful style offering breathtaking views over Tokyo, professional and friendly service, nice spa/health-club with pool and great food at a high price.Things you have to see and to do:Do not miss the wonderful Senso-Ji Temple in Asakusa, the people-watching in Ueno Park, the Hama Rikyu Garden with the 300 year old pine tree, the Yoyogi Park with the stunning Meiji Shrine, the vast Shinjuku Gyoen Garden (wonderfully coloured leafs in autumn), great souvenir shopping at “Tokyo Hands” in Shibuya and a visit of the Tsukiji Fishmarket in the early morning. For the sweet tooth – try Kit Kat with wasabi flavour, sounds crazy – but I loved it!Taxis are very expensive, use the Airport Limousine shuttle and in Tokyo the subway instead.About Tokyo and the people:I thought about Tokyo as a crowded city full of nondescript skyscrapers and full of rushing, rejecting people. The truth is that Tokyo is one of the most fascinating cities I have ever travelled. It is colourful, full of energy, fashion conscious and stylish, the city is very clean and very safe, the food is to die for (and it is not only sushi!), the great parks and gardens let you breath, the atmosphere in the wonderful temples will calm you down, the architecture is stunning (in Ginza, where every square metre costs a fortune, you can admire how clever – and beautiful – modern architecture can use limited space).But what really makes Tokyo so special and unique are the people in Tokyo. I travel a lot around the world, but I have never met so many helpful, polite, civilized and friendly people as in Tokyo. Hope to return soon for a longer trip!",berlin,"audax</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>berlin</strong>",101,4.0

As the title of this review suggests, I had an awesome time staying here. I would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in Tokyo and will come back here again. LocationIt is located in Roppongi which was extremely convenient for me since its a short 10-minute walk to our office in Mori Tower. You can also access the train system through mid-town mall which is connected to the hotel. So we had no problem going to other places in and out of Tokyo. It is walking distance from lots of restaurants and bars in roppongi so we had no problem looking for a place to eat. Impressively, you either get a view of Mt. Fuji on a nice clear day or the Tokyo Tower (since they're on opposite sides of the hotel). ServiceThe service is top notch. The staff are so very respectful and helpful. They will run to push the elevator button when they see you head towards the elevators. They will always greet you when they see you and ask how you're doing. They have on several occasions given recommendations on where to eat and what to do and gave directions on how to get to places. You can also ask them to book the airport shuttle for you which was very convenient. On our last night, they gave us a small plate of truffles which I ate in under 10-minutes. Every night, I get back to find a card on my bed that tells me the forecast for tomorrow, e.g. 10% rain, and temperature high and low. There's three sets of channels to choose from, I personally enjoyed watching the Japanese shows but they also have a set of English channels that carry CNN, BBC, etc. If you stay, try the coffee they serve at the lobby. We always got a cup on our way to work. Its actually pretty good and extremely helpful in the cold. AmenitiesThe rooms are awesome. The bathroom is huge with a nice big and deep tub, toilet, shower and his and hers sink. The algae salt they have were so good that I took more baths than usual (I usually just take a shower). The TV in the bathroom was convenient for when I took my baths. The toiletries they include are better than the travel ones I bring with me from home. The curtain can be controlled by switched on your bedside table. And since the hotel starts at the 45th floor, rooms have pretty good views of Tokyo.",California,"Jose T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",43,5.0

Every little need had been taken care of - I did not need to unpack most of my stuff. All toiletries were in the room. They had fresh comfy pyjamas available every day.

I stayed at both the Ritz and the Conrad during my stay in Tokyo and would absolutely pick the Ritz for the following reasons:1) Spectacular lobby - OK, both lobbies are amazing, but the Ritz's, with its Tokyo hi-so crowd, classical grand piano, and jaw-dropping views of the city was a cut above the Conrad and imbued a real sense of place.2) Gym facilities were probably the best I've seen in any hotel, anywhere.3) LOCATION. At the swanky Tokyo Midtown complex in Roppongi - this location is absolutely the middle of Tokyo and the Midtown and Roppongi Hills complexes are brand-new palaces of shopping and restaurants. The Roppongi area is particularly fun if you are looking to go out and party (yes, I am probably younger than the average Ritz-going customer so this may not be a concern for everyone...). The Conrad's location near Tokyo bay was great if you wanted to be in the business district of Shiodome but was totally dead at night.4). Service. This was Ritz service and details through and through - the little touches like Nespresso coffee makers in the rooms, the friendly greetings, etc were definitely better than the Conrad, which felt more like a high-end corporate hotel (think the W).5) Giant, well-appointed bathrooms. As others have mentioned - two vanities, separate shower and bathtub, etc.6) Views. Amazing views from every part of the hotel.Where the Conrad was better:1) Room decor. The Conrad rooms were modern, masculine, and sexy. The Ritz's were a bit vanilla but still very comfortable.","San Francisco, California","744ChrisK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",9,5.0

We stayed in a Club level room with our small son, and it was well worth the splurge. The Club lounge is fabulous - relaxing, with a good selection of food and drink 24 hours a day and, weather permitting, a wonderful view of Mount Fuji. Unfortunately our son got sick and we couldn't explore the surrounding area as much as we would have liked, but the fact that having had to spend most of our time in the room wasn't a hardship confirms my positive impression of this hoteI.

The first impression on walking into the room was OMG look at the view and believe me from the corner suite that is all you see with Mount Fuji on the horizon. The bathroom is everyone's dream double sinks, tv, a private toilet cubicle with a heated toilet seat/control panel and a power shower. The bedroom was very nice too and we enjoyed nights of fabulous sleep. Personally I felt the suite was let down a little by the furniture in the living room it wasn't so great and looked much older than the 4 yrs but with the view continually distracting us it didn't seem to matter so much.There were all the luxuries you would expect from this kind of hotel even down to complimentary pyjamas stowed in the drawer. House keeping was fabulous our supplies/towels/toiletries were constantly replenished throughout the day. One morning I had reason to return back to the room and as I walked in all I could only think was it looks like a major spring cleaning is going on rather than the remaking of the bed. Two small things that my husband and I both thought would have made things perfect would to have had milk or cream in the fridge rather than the powdered coffee mate provided... The hotel has obviously gone to the great expense of installing very expensive coffee machines but then spoilt the effort with powdered milk. Also perhaps the addition of one or two more English tv channels would be very welcome by guests.We booked our room through a travel agent so it came as a shock/ big disappointment to us that having a suite costing over $1000 a night didn't entitled us to have use of the club lounge or as we discovered the next morning include breakfast. The continental breakfast we experienced was a huge let down and certainly not worth the money. If breakfast isn't included in your rate I'd strongly suggest eating out at other nearby cafes/outletsThe rest of the foods/drinks/service we had in the lounge were all excellent and couldn't be faulted. As to our other experiences with members of staff we approached, whether it was a doorman, front desk clerk or concierge we found them all extremely helpful and willing to assist. The hotel is linked to the Midtown Plaza which we found very useful for shopping, restaurants and the metro system. Getting to Disneyland was a breeze once we figured out how the system worked.Would I return to this hotel? In a heartbeat but not at the price we paid for basically a room only package it wasn't worth it. I would take a smaller room that enjoys the club lounge benefits which according to the web site includes complimentary internet, five complimentary food and beverage presentations a day plus access to the gym and pool it seems a much better option.","Leeds, United Kingdom","Jc1967Uk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",13,4.0

I love this place. So I'll try and comment on some other things:Concierge: Really helpful. I wish I remember her name, she was totally cool. And she didn't turn up her nose when I wanted an authentic and cheap ramen place, nor when I asked her about a coin laundromat. (I can't bring myself to pay twice what my underwear cost to get them washed. Hotels are so silly this way still).Gym: It's kinda lame that they charge extra to use the locker room at the gym. I know it's a spa and all that, but really, at $500+ a night for rooms, you can't let your guests use the gym lockers without dinging them another 2,500 yen? Staying at the Hyatt Roppongi Hills the week before, I was impressed by how they went out of their way to sign me up to the Hyatt Gold Club just so I could enjoy their lockers and spa. The Ritz could learn from this.Lobby lounge: Because its a destination itself it didn't seem very inviting to the regular guests. After a day of work or sights it came across as stuffy. I felt like I needed a top hat and monocle.****Hotels can't be perfect for everyone and I was being critical above to add something new to the conversation.

The Ritz is usually known for their outstanding service and in this area the front desk staff was lacking. I called the hotel in the morning to ask for an early check-in and they said it was possible; however, when I got to the hotel it was no longer and option and I had to wait. I realize that early check-in is not guaranteed but if they say something they need to live up to it. Also, I like to stay on the upper levels of the hotel and requested a room on a high floor and was given a room on the second floor of the hotel (which was 47 stories up) and was disappointed with the flippant response from the front desk staff which said all rooms are high here. The other disappointment for me was the gym. I was told that my room rate included gym access and when I went down to use the sauna- I was told it wasn't included which was disappointing.

Very impressive but also slightly unnerving to someone not used to such levels of service. The room was in a nutshell gobsmackingly amazing. With views of Yoyogi park and the various skyscrapers of Shinjuku and even (on the last day which had a clear morning) views of Mt Fuji! Everything automated including the curtains while the massive bathroom had a separate TV which meant long periods in the bath drinking tea whilst watching crazy Japanese television. Bliss. The hotel is about 40 - 45 floors up and includes a swimming pool even further up which was interesting when swimming and looking out to see nothing but clouds floating past. Again the service here was impeccable. Then there were the little touches including a little card presented after evening turndown telling you about tomorrow's weather for example.

The rooms are quite classical which is not really to my taste, I prefer a little more modern decor but it was new, clean and done tastefully. From the moment you arrive you won't have to worry about a thing, every tiny detail is handled for you from the amenities in your bathroom, the subtle fragrance wafting through your floor to your food allergies and idiosyncratic requests. I stayed with relatives and their children who had children's cutlery and crockery provided at each meal time in room or in restaurant without prompting along with tiny bathrobes and slippers. Restaurants are excellent, breakfast buffet is comprehensive and high tea is lovely.Very friendly and accommodating staff who speak english with no problem at all. This is a great hotel for business or couples because it has the level of service you need / want on these occasions. In saying that if you take your family your children will be well looked after so this place gets my highest recommendation.

Reception is on the 45th floor along with a lounge. The smoky smell is off putting but this is Tokyo. Check in is efficient.The rooms are fantastic. Huge by Tokyo standards (I'd estimate at least 3 times larger than the last room I had at the ANA) and as you'd expect luxuriously appointed. Huge windows with a panoramic view of Tokyo.From service menu was surprisingly small but not as exorbitantly expensive as I anticipated, unless you wanted the special burger with foie gras which by my calculations cost three figures - not surprisingly i passed on that so I can't give you a review :(I used the pool and was very glad I did, would recommend it.Service as you'd expect is top notch.Free wi- fi.

Perfectly situated on top of an office complex in Roppongi you're first 'wow' moment will come at the floor to ceiling windows and the view from the 45th floor reception/lounge/restaurant area..wow!! Apparently this is the highest building in Tokyo and considering how many skyscrapers there are here I was surprised to see us towering over most of them. Did I mention the view? (hehe)I arrived late at night and check in was smooth, courteous and very efficient. I know some colleagues that arrived in the morning or even early afternoon had to wait to get their rooms but I was escorted up to my room on the 47th floor within 5-6 mins of arriving.Room:- When I walked in I was surprised by the size of the room and of course the night view at the enormous panoramic window at the end of the room. I'd read that rooms in Tokyo are typically on the smaller size but this 'standard' room was quite large and the bathroom absolutely enormous with full size rainshower, two separate sink/basin areas and a huge deep-soaking tub. Gadget fans will get a kick out of the 'command center' next to the futuristic toilet (common in Japan) and the in-bathroom TV etc.- Overall the room is well laid out, functional and comfortable. The bed was superb and I slept VERY well during my stay (apart from the jet lag.)Food:- I didn't tend to eat in as the prices are exorbitant but the few meals I did have including the breakfast buffet in the mornings was very nice. The food was flavourful, nicely presented and ticked all the boxes but the price is very hard to get past (think USD$100+ for a 2-course room service dinner!)Tip: If you don't mind an evening drink or two, instead of raiding the hideously overpriced mini bar, pop down to the 'food court' under the hotel complex as there is a 7-Eleven that sells everything from snacks to beers etc that you can just pop in the fridge for the duration of your stay.Facilities:- I worked out in the gym on the 46th floor most mornings and it was a great setup. A large room with comprehensive machines, free weights, and cardio machines. Due to jetlag I was typically in there very early in the morning so not too many people around so never a wait etc. The gym is accompanied by a large indoor pool and jacuzzi area which again was fairly quiet. Staff and attendants were everywhere and always had bottled water, towels etc at the ready.Pro's:- Location is amazing and a walk away from the energy of Roppongi- Very high quality 'everything' from the fittings, to the lounges, to the gym, room, bed etc..you will feel very pampered.- Very quiet rooms! (barely heard any noise on either side of me or above me..a rarity!!)Cons:- Of course the prices! If I was a leisure traveller and not on a corporate rate there is no way I could justify staying here. If the room rate didn't kill me, the 'incidentals' would..Even for Japan, this hotel is expensive.- The internet connectivity was flaky at best. All my colleagues complained of the same intermittent connectivity in their rooms and public areas. Luckily this was included in our rate or I would be very sore about having to pay for it.Summary:- This an incredible hotel that is well deserving of all the glowing reviews. Well situated and incredibly luxurious if you are looking to be spoiled/pampered while staying in the bustling area of Roppongi, then its hard to look past the Ritz Carlton.

The hotel is very well located above the Tokyo Midtown commercial complex (with many fine restaurants and shops), with access on foot to the vibrant Roppongi night-life and within a few minutes by metro to many of Tokyo's attractions. The hotel occupies the top 7 floors of a commercial tower and all rooms have a spectacular view overlooking one side of the city. From our room, we could see mount Fuji on a clear day! The beautiful rooms are quite spacious, even by western standards. The amenities are among the best among Tokyo's luxury hotels, while the Ritz trumps many others with better taste when it comes to its interior decoration and furniture. Although the hotel has been in operation for 5 years, everything still looks new. All rooms have a modern 42"" LCD TV which can be connected to a PC, in addition to a DVD player.The downside of the Ritz is of course the price. All that luxury doesn't come cheap and you feel it whenever you order anything extra. In-room dining is extremely expensive considering the size/quality/price compared to what you get a few floors below in Midtown. The breakfast buffet is pricey but very good. In-room breakfast is an expensive joke in comparison! The other thing I noticed is that air circulation in the room may not be very effective, considering that you cannot open any windows. The A/C system is very effective and extremely silent yet I'm not sure if it actually draws fresh air from outside or simply recirculates the air in the room. Having said that, not at any moment did it feel or smell 'stuffy' anywhere in the hotel.

But fortunately right next door there's a sizable shopping mall with good and reasonably-priced restaurants to choose from. I enjoy the diversity to choose from. After 6 days at the hotel, I still have many that I haven't got a chance to try. There's also a 24-hour supermarket right next door in the mall. I get my breakfast from there. Within 5 minutes' walk, you can get to the Ronpongi metro station and you can get almost anywhere from the subway. Free Wifi in the room but depending on the location of your room, you wifi coverage may be less than ideal. I spent 30 minutes on the first day with a NTT Docomo staff (hotel staff suggestion) trying to fix my signal but then the next day I was frustrated by the same problem (only 1-bar signal on my iPad).

We have stayed in many exclusive hotels around the world and I will tell you quite frankly that the beauty and elegance of this hotel are 2nd to none. Our view from the 53rd floor was unbelievable, with Tokyo Tower literally right outside our window. In fact, everywhere we went the views were stunning but if you don't like heights this hotel is not for you. In the Club lounge, the staff and presentation were outstanding. Staff continually went the extra mile to ensure we were satisfied. The Lobby Lounge on the 45th floor is a lively and interesting people watching venue with great music and an interesting mix of Japanese hipsters and Westerners. The ONLY issue we had was a very poor dining experience at the Tower's Grill on Sunday evening. To start off, I had requested a view table and was NOT accomodated. We then ordered the 5 course tasting menu which gave each of the 4 of us a menu of choices in 5 catagories. Our waiter was not very good to begin with as he continually was confused as to whom ordered what - not what you would expect at a place of this calibre. And somewhere between our 3rd and 4th course our waiter literally dropped off the face of the earth. Our (obviously) completed course sat on our table for a good 30 minutes before we finally summoned a waiter from another table to assist us. The late arriving 4th course was cold. We never saw our original waiter again. You get the idea.

For my 40th birthday, I chose two weeks in Japan, and chose to start the trip in Tokyo. All of my friends said they would never, ever, ever go to Japan for the rest of their lives, after watching the horrors in the movie ""The Cove"", and urged me to not go to Japan. It wasn't the issues of radiation that came up in conversations, it was always the movie ""The Cove""... in all honesty, I agree... I don't think we should support a culture that kills dolphins, feeds their people mercury-laden foods, kills whales, eats shark fins, or eats octopus (hey, they're one of the most intelligent animals on earth).... then again, we have a lot of things to be ashamed of in America.I was working with about 5 top-end hotels to see who could come up with the best combination of room type, amenities, and price. Ritz Carlton Tokyo ended up being my #1 choice, as they promised a room upgrade, birthday amenity, and I liked the fact that it was on top of the tallest building in Tokyo.So, for these reasons choose the Ritz Carlton Tokyo. 1) The View. When you travel, you should try to choose a hotel with a view from your room that is unmatched anywhere. Whether it is a beach view, a view of a lake, a mountain, or a skyline, you always deserve an amazing view.2) My previous experience at the Ritz Carlton in Kuala Lumpur, where I was upgraded to a club level room, had a butler that drew scented and salted baths for me, had breakfast in my room, two massages in the spa, and all of my laundry was magically washed and ironed each day - all of these things at no extra charge, so I was expecting these types of surprises at the Ritz Carlton Tokyo.When we arrived at 6am, the reception was amazing - staff members with perfect English skills, and we were checked into a room on the 47th floor, taller than any building in Tokyo, and had an amazing view. We obviously arrived early, so they put us into a temporary room, with two double beds, and the room was very nice. We were told that our upgraded room would be available at 2pm... so we went to sleep.When we moved rooms, we were ""upgraded"" into a smaller room! It was on a higher floor, but it really was not an upgraded room. Still, the view was fantastic. My birthday amenity was 4 chocolates on a plate, which were delicious, but it was a pretty standard offering for a hotel room costing almost $600/night. I would have expected something more along the lines of the Kuala Lumpur: upgrade to a suite, club level, baths, massage. I'm guessing that the suite costs the hotel $0, the massages about $20, etc... so in the grand scheme of things, offering a lot of freebies to a $600 per night room is a great way to retain guest loyalty.The breakfast each morning was very good, although there was no music at any one of our 3 breakfasts... play some music on the speakers, or have a piano player, or something... but to have a quiet place while dining removes one of the 5 senses from your experience, and makes the restaurant seem like a school cafeteria instead of a luxury restaurant.Still, this is probably the best choice of any hotel in Tokyo - while here for 4 days, I went to other hotels to check them out - the Peninsula was at first my #1 choice, but I am so glad that I did not stay there. The area around the Peninsula is boring, the views from the rooms cannot match the views from the Ritz Carlton, and the place seemed rushed and crowded with noisy people.The pool area was fantastic, although the ceiling in the pool area should be painted with a dark blue sky with gold-leaf stars or something... currently it is just a white ceiling, and it could be so much more luxurious. We were a bit disappointed to learn that the steam room cost money to enter - I think it was around $60/person, which was ridiculous.Here's the true reason for my 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating: regardless of issues with power availability due to the earthquake, I was shocked to see that the energy this hotel wastes. Not one LED light bulb... not one! This is shameful. All of the bath amenities: bath gel, shampoo, conditioner still come in tiny bottles... this hotel most likely disposes of 500,000 tiny plastic bottles into landfills (or the ocean) each year, almost all still have chemicals in them. This chemical makes its way into the water supply, and back into human consumption. All hotels should use wall-mount product dispensers like those you see in a spa, no exceptions... it is the only way you can respect your country and your environment. The sheets are washed daily unless you place a card on the bed, this should be the opposite, where you only place a card on the bed if you want your sheets washed. How many of us have our sheets washed every day, it's a silly waste of resources. Same goes for daily vacuuming of rooms - a vacuum cleaner uses a lot of energy - and each time it is used, tiny particles of dust, and dead skin, and bacteria are released into the air to settle back down on your clean sheets, your clothes, your furniture, etc. Only vacuum on check-out! Finally, the water kettle was always plugged in - this is extremely wasteful, just one kettle can use $400 per year in electricity! Be better about energy, get wall mount dispensers, include international telephone calls for free (I see this at more hotels these days), and this review would have been 5 stars.PS - The best concierge I've experienced in my life was Reika Ohsawa - she deserves gold keys, as she was the most polite concierge ever. She was warm, friendly, human, considerate, and always smiled. I will always associate Reika with Tokyo and Ritz Carlton. Thank you Reika! Mayako was also excellent - we only spoke to Mayako once, but spoke to Reika many, many times during our 4 days.Again, if you're staying in Tokyo, stay at the Ritz Carlton for the views and the service.... just be sure to ask for upgrades... for the price, more should be included in the room, but the view is worth the price alone. And if you're considering other hotels, stop considering them... I looked at the other top-rated hotels and this is #1, again, for the view from the rooms.","Phoenix, Arizona","PHXBen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",360,4.0

Everything below you is office or other accommodation until you reach a shopping precinct on the ground floor.We had booked a Club room, so we actually checked in ten floors above the lobby, and our room was one floor below this. The view as we woke on our first morning was simply amazing - a cloudless winter day, and Mt Fuji glimmering in the distance. As we were suffering jet lag, we watched every part of the sunrise, fascinated to see Tokyo reveal itself. The room itself was gorgeous - well-finished and spacious. Electric curtains and shutters - a first for me!The advantage of the Club room was the Club Lounge. Here we had our evening meal and our breakfast at no additional cost. The food was nice, and there was as much fizzy white wine (probably not Champagne) and beer as you wanted in the evening, and the dishes were nicely presented. The Club suited the four of us very well - on the return leg of a three week holiday we weren't up to the challenge of researching a restaurant selection...Staff were polite, even to the extent of politely ignoring us when we complained at the extra unjustified charges added to our bill. (We had two children with us, but they said we had only paid for one, whereas our booking entirely confirmed that we had been clear throughout. The hotel have continued to ignore us, but I am not going to be bitter about it.)The concierge staff were most helpful on bookings, and the swimming and jacuzzi are amazing.if you can afford it, stay here.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","ManorRoad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",132,5.0

The Ritz is located between the 45. and 53.floor of the Tokyo Midtown Complex in Roppongi, an area renown as an entertainment district. Having saved cash by using points I decided to indulge myself by asking for a club level room. I received one in the 53rd floor for 10K Yen per night. Sounds expensive at first, but I quickly learned that even for a person traveling alone it is very good value, as you can take your breakfast there, and there are four additional servings of food, including dinner snacks with drinks, and evening sweets. Another goody of Club Level rooms is the included Wireless and Wired Internet. The speed of the connection however was nothing to write home about. The staff in the lounge was extremely friendly without being artificial, so I felt very comfortable in the lounge, overseeing the city, a getting into a pieceful mood with a glass of house champagne or a glass of excellent Sauvignon Blanc.The room was very nice, as to be expected. Given that the room was advertised as 52 sqm I felt at first a bit disappointed, as the room itself was not that big, maybe 20 -22 sqm. But soon I learned, where lots of the space went: Into the bathroom. That bathroom was big, with two washbowls, a shower, a seperate bath tub, and of course, a toilet, a super-duper toilet with electronic controls, a bidet functionality and heated seats. The furniture of the room was a bit out-fashioned for my taste, but very good quaility. The bed however was simply fantastic. With the mattress firm, the sheets soft, the bed was a place one did not want to leave, so cozy it was. I tried two restaurants, the Forty Five for Sunday Brunch, and the Hinokizaka for a Kaiseki meal. Both were good, but I was a bit underwhelmed, especially by the japanese one. The Spa area with Gym is definitely worth a visit, with great views of the city. In summary I truly enjoyed this stay. Especially the Club Level rooms have something addictive to them.

They are very spacious (especially for Tokyo standards) and well appointed. The view was breathtaking and we were able to see Mt. Fuji from our room. (I am a sucker for night time city views, and the view from our room did not disappoint.) From what I understand, the hotel was built to make sure all the rooms have excellent views. The location is also very ideal for us because we love Roponggi for its dining options and night life. The giant shopping center next to the hotel is very convenient. There were a food court, a very cool supermarket and great shopping in the shopping center. Speaking of shopping, there's a Hermes and an upscale jewelry store (forgot the brand) right inside the Ritz Carlton.We had breakfast at the buffet restaurant in the hotel almost everyday because it was easiest for us. The food was just okay, especially given the prices. We were disappointed that the buffet was exactly the same everyday during the week. We heard that a champagne brunch is served on Sundays, but we checked in too late on the Sunday that we were there to go to the champagne brunch.We used the concierge a lot during our stay. They were always polite and professional, but I can't say that they were the warmest people. Front desk was the same- polite, professional, but not very sincere.Also, my husband works a lot (even on vacation) and he needed to work in the middle of night because he was on Los Angeles time. The concierge assured him that he could use the piano lounge in the lobby, even after they were closed for the night. However, that was not the case, and my husband was very rudely shoo'd away on two nights while he was conducting international conference calls.Housekeeping was generally good, although they were not as thorough on two occasions. It may be that they felt rushed because we came back to the room while they were still inside, despite the fact that we left them to do their job upon realizing they were in there.Overall, I really enjoyed the Ritz Carlton Tokyo.

Something for everyone here, wife likes to shop, kid and i hit the parks, and we all love the food. If you like city holidays and have not come to Tokyo, I encourage you to make the effort -- even if it's a long journey, it's really something to experience. The Ritz Tokyo is a very nice hotel and a decent base from which to enjoy the city. The pros and cons for us (two adults and one 3 year old) were,Pros1. very large room for tokyo -- easily accomodate me, spouse and mildy hyper 3 year old. 2. amazing views of the city.3. located atop a mall that was convenient when bad weather hit.4. lux bath and amenities.5. bought some bubble bath and wife and kid enjoyed.6 typical Ritz service, attentive but not effusive.7. lobby bar really is cool, even for a jaded Asia based traveler 8 we had access to free wi-fi internet. came in very handy.Cons1. hotel has a biz vibe, and sometimes we felt out of place as tourists.2. highly personal annoyance, i didn't like taking two sets of elevators each time to exit the hotel.3. cost, but it's the Ritz in Tokyo so you get what you pay for.4. cost of in room dining -- i just don't understand why hotels who try so hard to create repeat customers, then abuse those customers with outrageous costs...this a general comment -- not exclusive to Ritz5. Roppongi, personal, but i don't like the area in general, and particularly sketchy when with family. If you don't know Tokyo, Roppongi is a popular late night district with an extensive red-light scene. It can grate a bit if you're coming back late and need to walk the main road.Overall, this is a great hotel, access to lots of high end shopping and dining if you don't mind paying up. if you like mid-range shopping and dining (like me), it is probably better to stay in place like Shinjuku. Keio hotel is a nice, much cheaper option. Possibly useless tip, if you like coffee, then buy some Japanese brand coffee beans from any supermarket. It is really excellent, although buying a cup in Tokyo is an expensive and often unrewarding experience.","Clifton, NJ","msa99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clifton, NJ</strong>",25,5.0

On the top floors of the tallest building- gorgeous views in each room. Our standard room was anything but- stunning marble bathrooms, plush robes, gorgeous everything. The lounge was amazing as well- stunning views and a couple restaurant options. The concierge was the most memorable-- they learned our names immediately and were immensely helpful and courteous. Ritz did a great job with this property. Location-wise it's in the heart of the Rappongi district with tons of restaurants and clubs right around the hotel. Expensive? Yes. Luxurious? Yes. Would I stay there again? In a heart beat.","USA, pac northwest","LaurensLocket2007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>USA, pac northwest</strong>",10,5.0
