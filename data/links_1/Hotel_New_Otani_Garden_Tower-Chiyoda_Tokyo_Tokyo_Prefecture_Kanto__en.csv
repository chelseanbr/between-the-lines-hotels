The Main is fancier—the Garden Tower closer to the subway. The Main was a little more updated.And the staff are superlative. We left our big bags, so that we could travel light to Kyoto. When we returned to Tokyo, the staff had already put our bags in our room. Everyone was so helpful, professional, and courteous.The breakfasts, which we had at the beginning of the trip, were amazingly good, with a wide choice of Western and Japanese items that you can mix and match. The restaurants are very expensive, but there are many restaurants within a short walk, including some nice ones in the mall right across the street from the exit at the Garden Courtyard that is nearest the subway. (Right by that large flower sculpture.) It is nice to have a drink on the 40th floor—of course, it is an expensive pleasure, so you might want to go during happy hour.And I really love the Japanese garden, which we walked through almost every day.

The bathroom was good size and conveniently laid out. The internet was always ready to go and fast as well as the TV. Breakfasts were included as part of our Land/Cruise tour and we ate at each of the 2 venues. I think both dining rooms shared the same buffet breakfast menu. The 18th floor (could have been a higher level) dining room's views looked over a downtown area on one side and the Palace on the other. Good (but not ""to die for"") meals at both restaurants were included during our stay, with items most Westerners prefer. I happen to really enjoy eating local food and I was not disappointed.There are several other restaurants as well as shops in the lower levels. We only dined at one (The Rib Room Steakhouse - which I will cover in another review) but while it was very good it was also very pricey. There are a number of other restaurants located somewhat conveniently outside of the Otani (The Aux Bacchanales, our favorite and a great value - which I will also cover in another review) as an option.Bottom line, the room was clean and comfortable, their breakfast buffets very good AND with attractive views ... so the New Otani really fit out needs.But make sure to take a walk through their gardens before you leave. If you dine in the Otani's Garden Dining Room you will have a great view of it. Nice to look at from a distance.

In addition to around 20 restaurants serving virtually every cuisine you could want there are a substantial number of luxury shops across two of the lower levels. With a bit of luck you should also be able to locate a convenience store at the other end of the hotel and coffee shop (beneath the third tower which provides office space). We stayed 7 nights and I'm still not convinced that we found our way to every restaurant, shop or lounge area in the hotel and grounds. Surrounding part of the hotel is a 400 year old Japanese garden, complete with waterefall, which is well worth exploring.In terms of location it's only a short walk to the subway (but only if you find the right entrance which is next to the luxury car showroom) and a couple of old streets which provide numerous restaurants, pubs, bars and stores. The Imperial Palace and station are also within walking distance if you're fairly fit.Our bedroom was high up in the Garden Tower and like most in Japan it was on the small side with insufficient storage space for a long stay (we had to use one of our suitcases as a 'drawer') but it did have good views of the city and had everything we needed including a large comfortable bed and air conditioning. The bathroom was good with quality toiletries and everywhere was spotlessly clean. We had breakfast in both the Garden Terrace Restaurant which looks out over the garden waterfall and in the panoramic restaurant on the 40th floor. The latter offers stunning views but the choice of breakfast items was a bit limited. Breakfast in the Garden Terrace room was excellent with a massive choice of good quality items. We only had dinner once in the hotel, due to typhoon Higibis which forced us to stay in for 24 hours, and we found it expensive - a beer started at £15 and a single course was around £25. We ended up paying about £150 per person for a 3 course meal & a shared bottle of wine.

We checked the website, found a room that could accommodate 4 people at about $500 a day and off we went.First of all let ne say that the name of the hotel is a bit of a misnomer. The last time anyone could call this hotel new was probably about 40 years ago. The carpets, the furniture, the electronics were all vintage 1985.This hotel is huge. Check this out, it has 35 restaurants and bars. That's right thirty five!It also has its own park, an indoor and outdoor pools with some weird rules etc. An airport shuttle takes you to the hotel. A taxi from Narita costs $250 A decent dinner for 4 will cost at least $140Four restaurants serving breakfast. We checked out 3 of them. Decent selection which kind of gets old after a few days. Please note that only one restaurant has an omelet station.Service was hit and miss. Everyone tried to be very helpful but their approach was strange to say the least. Four people sit at the table, waiter brings 3 glasses of water...One day house keeping made the beds and that was all they did. No joke. Trash was not taken out, fresh towels were not provided. After we complained, the manager apologized profusely but again...Since this is an old hotel, it offers bigger rooms than the modern Tokyo hotels. Our suite consisted of a living room with a sofa and a bedroom in which they put 3 beds.Small bathroom with a high tech Japanese toilet, no separate shower. An odd sink outside the bathroom.Location was not bad. Five minute walk to the subway station. The problem with Tokyo is that it is insanely spread out so it is impossible to walk anywhere, you have to rely on public transport.Overall, I would recommend this hotel, especially if you travel with a family. It is not a five star despite their rating on trip advisor and in the United States it probably would not even be a 4 star property, but then again we were in Tokyo and pickings were slim unless you wanted to spend close to 1K per night.","Houston, Texas","Jason M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",67,3.0

Your heart sinks when you arrive. Everything from decor, service, room interiors and food is 30 years out of date. Unfortunately not in any good way. Nasty carpets, corridors that remind of a penal institution. The hotel feels like it’s been in terminal decline since about 1987.It is an excellent example of why people like Airbnb. To make it worse, it’s expensive. You feel cheated staying here. You don’t see guests or staff smiling in this institution. The general manager prowls the reception trying to work out how to ring a few more yen from each guest. Without doubt the worst hotel of our stay in Japan and Tokyo.

Wanna try its Teppanyaki next time (beautiful small restaurant inside its stunning city center garden) & buy a small painting from its small gallery (too rush in & out this time for it).因為他的品質夠好才會來住第三次，服務夠好（唯一例外是這次機場巴士上車處的服務生）、好棒的餐廳（握壽司餐廳一流、大廳咖啡很棒）、算是舒服的客房（房間還算夠大、沖涼水壓很強、但是這次免治有點接觸不良）、幾百年歷史的日本大花園沒次都讓我心曠神怡，就是這些讓我再度回來；地點還算不錯，鬧中取靜、容易前往東京各處，下次要來吃他驚人花園中的鐵板燒餐廳，也要來買他小畫廊中的畫（這次每天都太趕了）。","Taichung, Taiwan","ArthurWang095</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taichung, Taiwan</strong>",102,4.0

However, the interconnecting rooms only had 4 single beds, this is not ideal. I think that interconnecting rooms are usually used for families, so a queen/king in 1 room with 2 singles in the other is the best, but apparently New Otani dont agree.The staff at concierge were very helpful. The rooms were clean and tidy, but not luxurious.

Twin beds. The bathroom, albeit small was fine. Especially loved the large tile inset in the shower showing old Edo. The bed, as most in Japan are, was much too hard for me albeit there was a mattress pad on top to soften it a bit. Was better but honestly I think the beds could be improved. Absolutely loved the garden. Beautifully done and a brilliant waterfall. We left at 9 am and back at 11 pm everyday so didn't experience any of the restaurants or bars.

The shuttle bus was a bit slow stopping at many hotels on the way to the airport (50 minutes to terminal 1), but very convenient and priced around $10.The hotel grounds were impressive with two buildings, manicured gardens and 30 restaurants!! But here was the catch: While hotel rates were very reasonable for the quality service received, the on-site restaurants and bars had exorbitant prices.

Its huge and actually quite difficult to navigate all the halls/corridors, lifts, escalators etc. to find where you want to go. e.g. trying to find the way out to the nearby subway station can be confusing - signage in English could be improved.However its definitely quality accommodation. Its beautifully kept, not just clean, but polished, there are polite staff everywhere and it has lots of facilities, though TV channels could be improved.Room is very generous by Japanese standards - the size would put most to shame. e were in the Garden Wing and were amazed at the walk from the main reception area (almost 100m).We got our room at what we considered a very good rate for Tokyo but beware of the extras - in-house restaurants, breakfasts, dining etc. are mostly frightfully expensive. There are maybe 2 in house restaurants (of the 38?) that are reasonably priced but you have to search them out. If you want to eat on a budget go to the nearby area around the train station, there are cafes and convenience stores there.The proximity to the metro line is good for getting around Tokyo but I would recommend that if you are arriving by train to Tokyo Central you catch a taxi with your luggage as the subway line doesn't run from Tokyo central station. Also when leaving if you have an early flight don't rely on the bus service as it won't get you to Narita for a 9.30 am flight - back to Tokyo Central and catch the Harita Express.An absolute mind boggling hotel due to its scale - I can only assume its not 5* because it is so huge it doesn't quite have that homely feel.","Nedlands, Australia","DiggerPerth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nedlands, Australia</strong>",135,5.0

The rooms are old and tired, the TV has minimal channels (and virtually nothing in English) and the hotel services are painfully old-fashioned. For instance, you have to bring a breakfast voucher to the restaurant even though the computer already says that you have breakfast included. When I didn't have my voucher, I was asked if I could go get it. You have to sign a form to borrow an ironing board, and you have to log back into the wifi every time your have been away from the signal. Also, the prices are ridiculous. The cheapest glass of red wine in Trader Vic's is £20, and you have to pay £22 to use the gym or the pool. Paying to use the gym is not reasonable in a luxury hotel. The breakfast on the 40th floor is very average; cheap ingredients (only plain sliced white bread for the toaster). The buffet breakfast in Satsuki (in the main building, and you can eat there using your breakfast voucher instead of the Garden Tower) is far superior. Finally, the level of English among the staff was very limited. I know that this is a very famous traditional luxury hotel in Tokyo, but if it wants to be competitive with the big international brands then it will have to change.","Bristol, United Kingdom","Back_to_Sandringham</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, United Kingdom</strong>",162,3.0

We stayed in the Garden Tower with views over their Japanese Garden. The hotel is so big that even though we were on the 25th floor the room number started with a 45 which was a touch confusing.The room was supposed to be a non smoking room however a previous guest must have smoked in it as there was a smell of smoke trying to be disguised with a deodorising agent and not to effectively either.Although housekeeping did a fantastic job of keeping the room very clean it was rather dated and in need of a spruce up. There was only 1 bedside table and light so the other person missed out. Someone decided that the black/red cushions on the chairs looked good… they didn’t and looked totally out of place with the beige/faun theme of the room.The towels were great as were the toiletries (except no body lotion) bathrobes were supplied too but there were no hooks to hang them up on. The Japanese bidet was an experience…The view over the Japanese Garden (within the hotel grounds) was great and the Koi were so large in the ponds that you could see them easily.The staff were helpful and friendly although asking something out of the unusual caused a bit of confusion. It’s about time hotels had some sort of breakfast system in place for guests departing before the restaurants open.Breakfast was thankfully included in our rate from 2 locations, 1 on the top floor of the garden tower where you are supposed to be able to see Mt Fuji on a clear day (can’t see that happening very often) this restaurant was very dated and the food nothing special for a buffet style set up, just the usual stuff. The 2nd was overlooking the Japanese Garden, so a lovely location but again the buffet was nothing special and whoever chose the chairs obviously never sat on them as although they look good they are far to low to eat from at a table and are better suited to relax in with a drink of some sort.If you want to explore Tokyo the hotel is very close to a station on the Ginza Line which can take you to some of Tokyo’s main attractions.So in conclusion, if they undertook a refurbishment, not just of the rooms but the whole hotel including food offerings they would be 5 star.","Melbourne, Australia","AndrewTHawkins</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",24,4.0

We had booked a triple room and were advised when we checked in that the room was no longer available and we had been given a free upgrade which was a great start. The room itself elicited ""wows"" from all of us as it consisted of a sitting area with one bed, a dressing table corridor with two rooms leading off it (a loo and a wet room) which led through to a large double bedroom with walk in closet. The window in each bedroom provided amazing views of the city. The garden was lovely and there were numerous food options within the hotel. The subway was about a 10 minute walk away.

It is in a terrific location for someone wanting to visit Tokyo - a 5 minute walk to two subway stations that can take you anywhere in Tokyo. A nice couple of shopping/restaurant streets also just a few minutes walk. The room was a very nice size - about the size of a typical US hotel room and from my research, much larger than the typical Tokyo hotel room - we fit two people with two suitcases and two backpacks in each room and had space to walk around. I think they had about 5 different choices for breakfast, though we chose the main lobby buffet several times and were quite happy with it. Good selection of Japanese and Western dishes. They have a bar that is open till pretty late so you don't have to go out if you want a night cap. And even though it has over a thousand guest rooms, you did not feel like you would get lost in the crowd. We made use of the concierge several times to make restaurant bookings and never had to wait.

While the hotel has been an OK comfort over the years, it has never matched the quality of the Capitol Tokyu Hotel and it's regard for their regular guests. This was never more evident than on my most recent trip. I arrived at the hotel early and checked in early, as I have done numerous times over 13 years. Upon check out I find that the hotel charged me a full days rate for checking in early. No one had ever told me I would be paying a full days rate, nor had I ever been charged that before. The desk agent then said I signed for it when I checked in. Understand, I'm half asleep and sign wherever they tell me to sign when I check in, as it's normal....I'm not reading the fine print. So, I had no clue I was being charged a full days rate. I asked to have them waive the fee or at least cut it in half, which I would have agreed to, but they said no with no exceptions. I have NEVER experienced such disregard for a guests patronage to a hotel for 13 years....not in Hong Kong, New York, Germany or any of the many places I frequent numerous times a year for the past three decades. To say the least, this hotel cares about nothing but money and their greed. No discern for their loyal guests. To this I say SCREW YOU! I will gladly take my business back to the new Capitol Tokyu Hotel and all of my business relationships that travel with me. I will not tolerate it.

In a metropolis like Tokyo, space is a huge luxury, just the size of its lift lobby will attest to it. & Many of the restaurants come with stunning views , we have enjoyed great breakfast spreads with Tokyo at our feet.Plus its famous garden which has been around hundreds of years .Add to that the myriad of shops (again, look through the throw back in times feel for the contents within), I felt as if being on a nice cruise with many many rooms and too many good restaurants to count .

However, we stayed here over New Year period and the clientele certainly changed to include more families. I would say this Hotel is expensive and definitely geared towards a more mature crowd.You can see why this hotel attracts a more mature crowd as it is very traditional. There is literally staff everywhere to answer queries, assist you with the lifts, bookings etc.It does have that old world feel to it with the level of service they provide. A lovely touch was many of the staff were dressed in traditional Kimono for the NY period, whether this was an optional for staff or something Hotel management required I actually felt this was a nice nod to tradition. The shopping available again, is geared towards a more mature market however there is quite a lot on offer.The hotel complex is huge and you do get a workout walking throughout the hotel. We stayed in the Garden Tower on the 22nd floor, the view wasn't anything special however the room had a generous king sized bed, a large desk, and full length mirrors installed in the wardrobe. The bathroom room is a small but you can't really complain, the fittings are well maintained and very clean.They don't scrimp on providing toliteries either ( this is a pet peeve of mine, when you only get one set of tolietries to last you your stay). Clean robes are provided daily which is a lovely touch.The Hotel is a short walk to Asakasa-Mitsuke station so reaching shopping districts like Ginza and Shibuyu is quite easy. Asakasa-Mitsuke station has an information centre where you can purchase your Pasmo card from the friendly staff. Like most of Japan, the New Otani Tokyo is efficient and has exemplary service. On our last day, the Hotel kindly arranged for us to become members to th New Otani club so we could make use of the club lounge whilst we waited for our airport transfer which was late afternoon.The Restaurants are expensive so be prepared to spend some money if you prefer to eat in your meals in a Hotel setting. We visited the Tower Buffet for dinner one evening and although the views are lovely I found the service here one of the only places where service was a little slow. We enjoyed a New Year's Buffet at Trader Vic's and it was really really nice. This was all arranged at the last minute by Concierge. The beautiful 400 year old garden the Hotel is built around is great to experience both in the evening and daytime. Stay here for a bit of peace and quiet amongst the bustling Toyko.

We enjoyed the buffet breakfast all three mornings of our stay, once in the Garden Lounge and the other two mornings in the Tower Buffet up on the top floor. Both had expansive offerings of both Asian and Western cuisine. The Tower Buffet does open an hour earlier than the Garden Lounge.The rooms were an adequate size but not overly large. Our twin beds were a bit low to the ground but were comfortable enough. There was one nightstand between the two beds but at least it had electrical outlets.While there was a luggage stand, there really wasn't anywhere but the floor that I could open up my clamshell luggage and keep it open for our stay. Not sure what the answer is for that but this is not the only hotel where I've had that issue.The bathroom was large enough and had the electronic toilet features like I'd seen at the airport (though without the privacy button that played music like the airport toilet had!). By contrast the room's thermostat was not electronic but performed its function well enough. The A/C here did the best job of keeping the room cool during my entire Asian trip.Our room had a connecting door with our friend's but management must unlock the doors if you want to join the rooms.Our room was high enough to provide us with a lovely view of the area. An English-language newspaper was provided to us each day as well, which was nice. I was surprised to find fewer English-language TV channels than we'd had in China. Often I never turn the TV on when I travel but my roommate for this trip checked it out in every city we visited.The staff was terrific and very eager to assist, even going so far as having a staff member waiting outside the elevators in the lobby so they could push the UP button for us!In addition to all the restaurants in the hotel itself (on multiple levels) nearby is the Akasaka district which had loads of dining as well as shopping. We enjoyed just walking through the area and soaking up the sights, sounds and smells of the area.There's also a subway/train stop just outside the hotel which would make this a very convenient place to stay almost no matter where else in the city you went. The stop is about a five-minute walk from the closest hotel entrance but keep in mind it can take ten (or more) minutes from their to the proper elevator tower in the hotel, depending on which tower your room is in. It's a big complex and the map you receive at check-in is definitely helpful.If I ever come back to Tokyo I would be happy to stay here again!","Memphis, Tennessee","Cards-Preds-Fan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Memphis, Tennessee</strong>",77,4.0

There are also a great number of restaurants to choose from, both in the hotel and in the basement arcade.The only drawback of this hotel is its somewhat isolated location, something which is easily cured by a short walk to the nearest subway station Akasaka-Mitsuke.

You don’t want to have an issue here as they are not trained to handle complaints/issues in a professional manner and communications are difficult given limited English that is spoken. In an international hotel I do expect at least a subset of the staff to be able to communicate properly in English. You combine that with old infrastructure and I strongly recommend staying somewhere else. If you need to be in this neighborhood than stay across the street at the Princes Gallery. Before providing more color on my two main issues here are my other views: breakfast is okay but served in a great location on the top floor, the Japanese garden that is part of the property is wonderful, the voucher system for meals is archaic, the rooms are too small and the ceilings too low, location is good, subway close by, ...Service issue: I was supposed to have two connecting rooms as I was traveling with my family and we have young kids. I confirmed ahead of time and then again in person when I had arrived two days ahead of my family. In each instance I was told that was no problem. When my family arrived and we were supposed to switch to our connecting rooms they didn’t have them for us. They were unapologetic and for hours told me they didn’t have any solution and we had to live with it. I refused to accept this and ask to speak with ever more senior managers. At one point they offered a solution where, if I pay an additional couple thousand US dollars, they could organize a suite with connecting rooms in the main wing of the New Otani hotel. When I asked whether this was normal procedure to have their customers pay for the hotels mistake they told me yes and this was the only solution. It wasn’t until I demanded to speak to the GM and started moving my family to the Prince Gallery Hotel across the street did they find a solution for me (the Prince Gallery btw is an outstanding hotel)Infrastructure: this hotel was originally built in the 1960s for the Olympics, today the rooms are generally too small and the ceiling too low. They also haven’t invested enough in IT and so you have to use an old fashioned voucher system to access your various restaurant options. It all feels very dated.","Princeton, New Jersey","SwissScrivs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Princeton, New Jersey</strong>",130,1.0

My room was large and comfortable, with a number of amenities, including a climate control system that was easily operated from a convenient wall thermostat. The room featured a desk, chairs, a sofa, a fridge, a safe, tea makings with a hot water dispenser, and OK lighting, which was easily controlled from multiple locations but unfortunately didn't cover all parts of room. The quick and efficient housekeeping service provided two new complimentary bottles of water each day.The room offered ample drawer and closet space, where I found, among other amenities, a long-handled shoehorn, a whisk broom, and two sets of robes and slippers. The bed was quite comfortable and was adjacent to a handy control panel for clock, sound, and lighting. In-room wi-fi was included as were many channels of free TV that mostly offered Japanese language broadcasts, but I was able to find some English language news channels as well.The bathroom was excellent in every way, especially the bath and efficient shower, along with a high-tech Toto toilet offering multiple user options such as a heated seat. Very quick hot water was available at all hours. Bathroom amenities included an auxiliary phone, hairdryer, shower caps, body wash, and tooth brushes. In addition to the exceptional guest rooms, the New Otani boasts several high-quality restaurants. I enjoyed excellent buffet breakfasts with ample hot and cold choices in the top level of the Garden Tower complex (with a striking view of the Tokyo skyline) and at the Garden Lounge on the main corridor between the principal sections of the hotel. A Japanese breakfast was available at a restaurant on the first floor of the Garden Tower.I found the English-speaking front desk staff to be friendly and helpful, and I especially appreciated the quick action from the Garden Tower front desk on my only special request -- to open and reset the room safe that a previous occupant had left locked.Shops and recreational facilities in the hotel’s public areas are easily accessible. Very much worth visiting during your stay is the stunning centuries-old Japanese garden conveniently located near the Garden Lounge off the long corridor between the two principal areas of the property.I was quite happy with all aspects of the New Otani Garden Tower and would be very pleased to stay there again the next time I visit Tokyo. One caveat: The overall property’s two principal sections are spread out horizontally over a very large area, so bring your walking shoes if you want to explore its many impressive features, from the Main Section to the Garden Tower and everywhere in-between. And if you enter the property from the bus/taxi entrance to the Main, be sure to take the escalator up one level to the receiption area before navigating the long walk to the Garden Tower. It’s easy to get lost if you attempt to get there through the lower-level corridor.","McLean, Virginia","RonKVA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>McLean, Virginia</strong>",110,5.0

The rooms are always tiny . Not in New Otani . Generous sized room , bigger than most hotel rooms in London .Everything you might need is supplied in bathroom ..shampoo ,razor ,toothbrush etc The rooms might seem expensive but shop around and you can get really good value .I would advise booking a few months in advance as quite a bit knocked off price.Also avoid Japan public holidays as prices shoot up .Before travelling well worth applying for New Otani club card via hotel site .Its a loyalty scheme ,doesnt cost anything but there are a number of benefits . Eg .we had 1000 yen off price of breakfast each morning . We arrived about an hour before check in time so whilst waiting the receptionist showed us to the club lounge (on 3rd floor) given coffee and cake ! Free bottled water , newspaper every day (in English ,Japan Times)The hotel is enormous ,many restaurants and shops . Apart from breakfast we didnt eat there as a bit too expensive .If you go out of Garden Tower exit (not main entrance , which is opposite end of hotel)turn right ,cross bridge ,(Nagatacho Station entrance is across road on left) go across zebra crossing you will come to street with a Wendys shop on corner.The street is full of places to eat and drink . We found a couple of good bars to drink in .Also directly opposite Garden Tower exit is big complex with places to eat or have coffee .Some people have complained of location but the station is only 3 minutes away . Use the Tokyo public transport app Hyperdia and you will easily find your way around .The highlight for most people at hotel is the traditional garden which is truly breathtakingly beautiful .When I have more time will put some photos on of it .Breakfast in the tower buffet restaurant is reasonablely priced and the view of the city is fantastic (40th floor) , Good variety but dont expect 'the full English' your in Tokyo . My main tip would be to use the Garden Tower exit when going out and about as the Main entrance is is a little bit away from Nagatacho station and the shops,bars in Akasaka .","St Helens, United Kingdom","BillyBMerseyside</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St Helens, United Kingdom</strong>",38,5.0

The garden tower entrance is a 3 minute walk from exit D of akasaka mitsuke station. Behind the metro station are several lanes of bars, restaurants, shops. Great food options. Easy access to airport (airport limousine bus stops at the hotel) whereas keisei skyliner you have to take the metro and walk far- a bit of a hassle if you don't know where you are going. The hotel has a beautiful 400 year old traditional Japanese garden. The staff are very helpful and friendly and speak English very well. On our last morning we had a great view of mt Fuji in the distance. The negatives- we had to complain 3 times that our aircon was not cold enough. Themostat might have been broken but actual room temp was basically 25degrees Celsius but aircon was at lowest setting. Got uncomfortably warm every night. They replaced a filter and did other stuff but it was never cold. We were 2 adults and 2 kids, they knew to bring extra towels once we checked in- but every day after housekeeping always forgot. We would have to call every day for 2 extra towels. Upon check out- found out our kid had accidentally watched 5 minutes of a pay per view children's movie - since there are no TV channels in English... everything is dubbed in Japanese. It was not very clear on the screen that this movie would cost us 1600yen (8USD). I was shocked at the price- and annoyed since he only watched it for 5 minutes. Despite their apologies for the aircon issues- they didn't make any effort for service recovery. I should have insisted they reverse the charge for the movie but we were late for the airport and had to leave.

Our room was on the 30th floor with a view of the garden, Akasaka palace and city - truly a breathtaking view. We always find the staff at this hotel to be extremely helpful, polite and genuine. We requested a non-smoking room, and it was confirmed at check-in that we were on a non-smoking floor. Sadly, someone had done quite a lot of smoking in there. When we told the front desk, they said they would take care of it while we were at dinner. On our return, we found a spray bottle of deodorizer. Not exactly how we thought the problem would be resolved. Our room had a king bed and was clean and comfortable, but the air conditioning was inadequate. It averaged 75 degrees, running full blast with the curtains closed during the day, yet the hotel has a plush down comforter on the bed in the heat of summer with no top sheet. The best part of staying at this hotel is the 400 year old garden. It is spectacular, and we enjoyed walking in it and gazing at it from our room and at breakfast. Breakfast in the restaurant overlooking the garden was a highlight of our days, and the buffet selection was excellent with great coffee. Try the sesame salad dressing - it's delicious. It's sold in the hotel, but it took consulting several helpful employees in order for us to find the shop it's sold in. That's mostly because this is a massive property. Taking the airport bus back to Narita, the staff stood outside and waved to those on the bus. I thought this was more of the friendliness that we've come to love in Japan, but when the bus stopped at other hotels to pick up passengers, nobody waved goodbye. It sounds trivial, but that last experience best describes the warmth one experiences while staying at the New Otani. Are there more modern, more luxe properties? No doubt.

Everything is absolutely well-maintained and nothing looks tired or worn.The view from the room on clear days offering a view of the garden, the surrounding city scape and Mount Fuji as well, was very impressive.The breakfast served in the Tower restaurant had a wide variety of choices and was of very good quality. Unfortunately the choice and service from the restaurants during day service was not as good, as during breakfast times. The simple request for a vegetarian meal (for some strange reason they put meat into the vegetable quiche), was answered by a “We can’t change anything on the menu” and “You could have a Caesar’s salad”. A Caesar’s salad is by definition not a vegetarian option. I was very disappointed by this attitude of service/kitchen staff.The New Otani also has a very nice outdoor pool, which is a real asset for the hotel. Entrance fees (strange enough that they exist for hotel guests), are waivered if you sign up for the New Otani guest relations card. Unfortunately the opening times of the pool are strange. It only opens during Golden Week and in July and August and then opening times are limited to 9:00 to 16:30.

The room was very comfortable, plenty of space and very clean. I will say the AC did not get very cold, it may have not been turned on as it was still cool out, and this wasnt a deal breaker, I just tend to like it really cold at night since hotel covers tend to be on the warm side. The bed was a thinner mattress than I am used to, again not a deal breaker I know my preference for pillow top mattresses wont be met everywhere. and the beds were plenty comfortable. The room was two twin beds, slightly larger than I would say a US twin bed is, and perfect for us in sharing the room. Since we were there at Cherry Blossom time the room had some special extras, that I do not think are there year round, but could be. We had some bath soaks left for us each night with Cherry Blossom scents, and they are awesome. I packed the ones we did not use to take home and use, cause they were amazing. The cleaning staff were great, we left the do not disturb up one day since we had hand washed some laundry ( long trip, short on packing space) and we didnt want they cleaning around it, so they called us at night to see if we needed turn down or fresh sheets/ towels since they had marked the room as un- serviced. The breakfast included with our stay was good, but the restaurant was over crowded each day and if you did not arrive early enough there seemed to be quite the line. Despite the line we did have very friendly service, food was refilled on the buffet quickly and we never had to wait to long for our tea and coffee at the table. The location was quite close to a metro stop, so it was easy to get around the city, and the taxi drivers we used all knew exactly where to take us, even if they had limited english.

Compared to the new modern stars of Tokyo's vibrant and top class hotel scenery, it can't compete with the amenities of the newer and more fashionable hotels of the big international chains. It's location close to the thriving Akasaka district and in the proximity of the Imperial Gardens, which are an oasis of green in the mega city of Tokyo, make it a good place for getting around town. The New Otani has it's very own zen-garden including a small lake or rather a pond full of koi fish. The garden is the outdoor connection between the two main buildings of the hotel. One can also use the sunlit gallery to traverse from one building to the other. The gallery is also the location of the main buffet restaurant overlooking the garden with it's massive glass front. The rooms are rather small and a bit dated but offer enough comfort for most business travellers. At first the New Otani does not feel like something special but once you notice the details of the design, the setting, the garden the bar at the main building one can imagine that this place must have had its glory days when it was younger. Wondering around the premises it almost feels like seeing a beautiful but old woman who aged in grace. One can imagine how strikingly beautiful she was when she was younger and she still has not lost her attraction albeit the shine is somewhat dimmer. Would I recommend it? Yes. Would I come back? If I had the choice between the New Otani and some of its pricey, younger competitors I would probably chose the latter just because Tokyo is the place, where you expect to be in a modern, urban environment sort of glass and glitter and steel and the future.... On a sunny day go to the restaurant at the top floor of the Garden Tower to see incredible views of Mount Fuji.

Depending on the type of travel and destination, I also stay in many kinds and levels of hotels. This was my first time staying in the legendary New Otani (although I had dined and drunk in its restaurants before) and I sincerely hope it was not the last. I might go as far as to say that this was possibly my favorite of any hotel I've stayed in. Let me elaborate.The hotel complex is large, to say the least. My elegant and very comfortable room was on the 33rd floor of the Garden Tower with stunning views over the city all the way to Tokyo Tower. One of the lovely features in New Otani is its gorgeous Japanese garden. It's large and beautiful, replete with carp ponds and waterfalls. A veritable haven in the middle of the bustling megacity.Then there are the restaurants. It's impossible to sample all of them, unless one stays a very long time, for there are more than 40 restaurants, cafes and bars inside the hotel complex. There are many superb restaurants with Japanese, Western and Chinese cuisine. As I had many appointments out on the town, I only had the chance to have lunch in Trader Vic's (an old favorite with a Tiki theme; excellent food and atmosphere overlooking the Japanese garden) and have drinks in the Tower Cafe on the 40th floor of the Garden Tower and in the dark Capri where Japanese businessmen take their dates and a female pianist plays jazz in the background. There is also live music nightly in the Garden Lounge.Needless to say, the service everywhere in the hotel is first class: friendly, helpful and fast. The hotel also serves as a stop for the limousine buses to Narita airport.The location could not be better. All the attractions and pleasures of Tokyo are within just a few minutes' walk from the hotel. Akasaka is a major restaurant and entertainment area in this megacity. It also has a number of subway lines that connect to other parts of the city. I personally enjoy walking and Tokyo is actually a great city for pedestrians, so one day I walked to Roppongi and on another to Aoyama and Shibuya, neither of which is a demanding trek.When it was time to pack up and leave (and have my bags delivered from the room to the airport bus), I felt a desire to stay on.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","JuhaUitto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",51,5.0

We stayed on the 29th, I don't think that the Main hotel is as tall. Consequently the view is amazing, although from our corner room we looked out over Akasaka and a lot of businesses and highways. I bet a garden view would have been amazing from that floor. Anyway, we spent 3 nights here on some hot days in the summer. There were 3 of us in a room that had 3 single beds. This was called a Twin Superior and I booked it from the website stating that 3 adults would be in the room. So this was perfect for the family. Be aware that the beds are very hard here and at most of the hotels we stayed at in Japan, but the linens on the bed were really nice. This corner room had a small sitting room with a couch, coffee table, chairs and desk. The room also had two TVs, but they only get CNN and BBC in English. We didn't try the on-demand services. The Internet worked great throughout the hotel. Our only problem is that the rooms never cooled as much as we would have liked, but it was okay. And the humidity, which was high outside, was also high in the rooms. For example, we washed out some shirts in the sink and it took 3 days for them to dry in the room. The towels in the bath were fabulous! Nice and big. The ceilings were a bit low in the room, so my hubby and son, both several inches over 6ft. had to remember to duck. The location of the hotel is great. It's an easy walk to the Tokyo Metro and there are several parks nearby that you can walk through. If you forgot something, the BIC Camera store 2 blocks away has 7 floors of everything. The restaurants in the hotel are a bit expensive ($20 for dessert and tea), but the service is great. Around the hotel are lots of great restaurants, easy walking distance. The hotel has a pool that looked really nice, but has an additional fee associated with it. Frankly, after long days of touring, I don't think we could have walked to the pool anyway!!","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Jeanne B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",70,4.0

Located within walking distance of the Imperial Palace in one direction and the Asakasa food district in the other, and a short subway ride from the Ginza, it's just about a perfect location. The hotel grounds are themselves a beautiful garden. Just outside, a section of the old moat wall offers a serene walking path with nice city views. Food was excellent, as was service. So why add a cautionary note to my rating? Because of the crowds. This is a big hotel, and it caters to tour groups and conventions. The corridors can get crowded, as well as the breakfast area. But the included breakfast is among the best, and as a member of a tour group myself I can't complain too much about the crowds. By the way, I see no reason to draw a distinction between the Garden Tower and the main hotel. They were built at different times, but are now connected by a passageway full of upscale shops and share a reception area and dining rooms.

We stayed in the garden tower which is the newer and taller of the buildings and our room was on the 33rd floor. The room was large, clean and well equipped, including a kettle to make tea, it also had a good view over Tokyo. The hotel had a number of restaurants, western, Japanese, Chinese and Korean, two of them were on the top of the two buildings and the view from the 40th floor was amazing. There is also a superb Japanese garden in the centre of the hotel were you can escape for some peace and quiet.The hotel is not cheap for food and drink, we ate one evening in the western style restaurant in the main lobby and two chicken burgers and two small beers came to £48. A visit to the bar on the 40th floor for a small beer and a small glass of wine was £26. But there are alternatives as it is only a short walk to numerous restaurants and a few bars, there are also a number of small supper markets selling sandwiches, snacks and drinks, there is actually one within the hotel complex.The hotel is in a good position for visiting Tokyo as it is within a short walk of the metro station with links to all parts.","Swansea, United Kingdom","clive h</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Swansea, United Kingdom</strong>",45,5.0

My advice is be adventuresome and leave the comfort of the hotel and try some of these restaurants. The hotel has no problem filling the seats of the restaurants. But most people eat out.

The room was big enough to fit all beds, a desk and a sitting area which is quite big on a Tokyo hotel scale. The bathroom was compact but comfy enough to fit all our toiletries; I wish they had more hooks for our clothing. The hairdryer was the folding travel type but powerful enough for my brushing. The room didn't have any ironing board nor iron available but it had a boiler that could be filled with tap water. I liked that it had an extra sink outside the bathroom which allowed the kids to brush their teeth and go to bed while I was having a bath; it was a bit tricky sometimes to share a bathroom between the 4 of us. Our packaged included breakfast and we had 4 restaurants to choose from. The Japanese brekkie at Nadaman was divine. The continental one at the Garden lounge was disappointing and the breakfast buffet at Sabuki (not 100% sure about the name but it was located in the lobby of the main tower) was pretty good. The hotel also has a convenience store and a pharmacy as well as heaps of restaurants. There are also lots of little shops that seem to be frozen in time; some of the merchandise and clothing sold date back from the 80s. Overall, the service was good; I just found check-in a bit slow and I had to complete a form again with all my details whereas that was already done online.

I think the cleaner meant to come back and forgot, or finding we were back, said nothing. Our passports were in the room and that could have been disastrous. As it turned out nothing was taken and all was good and the house manager apologised. The other slight problem was one of communication with breakfast. We wanted the continental breakfast and they kept insisting that we have the buffet.

It was a very good sized room and elegantly decorated in black and silver.There were two very large single beds with fresh white sheets, changed daily ( including the duvet inside!) and a nice bolster cushion in turquoise and black and silver on the bed.

The tap water is safe to drink though so we drank both.Wifi was free and pretty fast too which was good. We had two comfortable chairs and a small table near the window where we sat at night admiring the view of the sunset over Tokyo. There was a chair and desk unit with the TV, mini bar, fridge , coffee and green tea ( no milk just coffee creamer and sugar) , kettle and two big drawers .Every hotel in Japan that we stayed in let us two Yakutas (light cotton kimonos ) but this hotel also had two white fluffy towel bath robes as well. The Yakutas were changed daily while the bath robes lasted our stay.We had a large wardrobes with about ten hangers, a safe with coded lock was within the wardrobe but the door opened towards us sideways so it was quite a challenge to see the code to set it! A shelf above the hanging area was good for more storage. A folding suitcase stand was also in the wardrobe and there was a carpeted shelf on the desk unit which also could be used to hold a case too.The room was nice and light and airy and di have pretty good lighting too with reading lights for both beds and a central bedside table with a clock integrated facing the room so not easy to see from the bed!You could set the wake up call from the room using the phone and didn’t have to request it in person which was useful.THE BATHROOMThis was not a bad size and has a shower over the bath. The bath was quite a good size and the shower also quite good. A shower curtain and not a screen was used as the Japanese do like their baths too.The sink was set in a unit with a work top area and there were lots of toiletries etc left for us. We had shampoo, conditioner and body wash, two toothbrushes, two folding hair brushes, two razors. A folding hair dryer was on the shelf but no plug outlet in the bathroom not anywhere near any of the mirrors in the room which was annoying for me.The toilet was the most amazing contraption ever and in fact we had these in every hotel and in many public toilets too.Firstly it was huge and you could choose from many options such as heated toilet seat, various bidet options which we didn’t dare try in case we got a nasty surprise. It was ran trickling water as you sat on the seat to perform to cover any embarrassing noises and maybe to encourage you to wee, who knows? I found it rather disconcerting personally.BREAKFASTWe were on a bed and breakfast basis so the only meal we ate in the hotel was breakfast as food in the hotel was very expensive. There were many restaurants to choose from for eating other meals but for breakfast we could choose from three.Every one of the three was busy and if you had to be ready by a specific time then it paid to get there as the restaurant opened as otherwise you had to queue while waiting for others to finish their breakfast. There was a queue as it opened but at least you knew you would be in as it opened and would not have to wait for others to breakfast first.The hotel had a huge number of restaurants from pizza places to cafes and every type of restaurant you might imagine. There are 38 places to eat in total in the complex. And around 3,000 people can be accommodated in restaurants in the complex.There were also exclusive shops in various places around the hotel, some along the passageway between the two towers and many more on floors below. All offering items that only the very wealthy could afford and to be truthful nothing tempted me.","Nottingham, United Kingdom","catsholiday</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nottingham, United Kingdom</strong>",52,4.0

We felt that it was very good, although we had some ups and downs.If we were advising friends intending to stay there, our first piece of advice would be - to get to breakfast before the crowd--no matter which breakfast restaurant you choose. Of the three locations, one opened at 6 am and the other two at 7 am. We chose the one on the top floor the first day we were there, and it took 15 minutes in a pre-breakfast queue to be seated. On subsequent days we arrived at opening hour at other restaurants. Many tours book rooms at the New Otani, so there are bound to be peak demand hours depending on when tours leave in the morning.- We would also advise friends to admire the splendid garden outside of the garden cafe right after breakfast when there are only one or two other people out there. The gardens are especially charming when they appear peaceful, quiet and private.The hotel is grand in size and operations with so many first class restaurants and expensive shops that all the time we were navigating its main building and additions.

It has a historical garden which offers tranquility, while a water fall and peaceful swimming Koi gives it a beautiful and lush greenery setting. Whilst there, we saw numerous couples taking their wedding pictures in their wedding gowns and kimono. I would recommend that this garden is a must visit, if you stay here. But if you do not stay here, it is still worth a visit. Visiting is free for all.One tip though, if your room package does not comes with breakfast included. You may want to consider joining their hotel membership (ask at the front desk). This allows you free wifi access, breakfast comes in a special rate (almost halved the listed price) and late check out. I would recommend this hotel especially if you have children.","Singapore, Singapore","S_K_FOO_may_2012</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",39,5.0

We also dined at their Tempura restaurant our first evening which was very nice. The hotel staff we encountered were all extremely friendly and helpful, especially the concierge desk which we used and took advantage of many times throughout our stay.The hotel also has a beautiful garden, which we walked around on our final day there in Tokyo.

The hotel is located in a very convenient location with easy walking access to the Tokyo subway and metro train stations and the many restaurants in the Akasaka disrict. The numerous hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and our lack of Japanese language skill wasn't a problem. The hotel facilities are excellent with five restaurants available for breakfast, we stuck to Top (aptly named as it is on the top floor of the Garden Tower) and the Garden Lounge both were good but Top offered a better variety of food with a nice view over Tokyo. The Garden Lounge had a great view over the Japanese garden and felt a bit more relaxed than Top but the food was of a slightly lesser standard and variety.

I have requested this simple task at many hotels around the world and have never been refused before. The hotel boasts 30 restaurants; but what it doesn't mention is that the vast majority are closed / last orders by 9pm. So little opportunity for a pre-dinner drink in the bar. Our room was very traditional with a lovely view over the Tokyo skyline, we were offered a room upgrade in the more modern part of the hotel but as our stay was short we declined. The garden is beautiful and the outdoor pool is lovely. We used the Limousine bus service to Narita airport which was excellent.

The room was actually a suite, with separate rooms for sleeping and relaxing. The bedroom had three comfortable single beds, good closet and general space, well appointed bathroom with a second sink & mirror outside, which was convenient. The separate living area has a couch with separate easy chairs, working desk, and flatscreen TV. This room had a city view (see attached photo), looking down toward the nearby and very convenient Akasaka-mitsuke Tokyo Metro Station (Ginza and Maronouchi Lines). We did not have a breakfast package, but utilized the Family Mart and small supermarket within the same complex to source our morning fare. There is also a good coffee shop near the Family Mart. So many reviews note the historic on-site gardens, and rightfully so. The 400 hundred year old traditional garden is genuinely impressive (great for family photos!), and are a truly unique feature of this hotel. Within the gardens is a rather pricey restaurant in a very beautiful setting, as well as a chapel where a Christian fellowship meets on Sundays.Best way to get here from the airport is by airport bus, which drops off and picks up from the main entrance. Location is really very good, only a quick walk from Akasaka-mitsuke station, as mentioned, which gives easy access to the entire city. There is a major restaurant area on the street just behind the station (parallel to the main road), lots of interesting options. There is also a massive BIC Camera location right above the station, all you need for any electronics shopping.The area around the hotel apparently has lots of cherry blossoms in season - would love to stay again and experience that. I would definitely recommend this hotel, and would not hesitate to stay again.One last tip: before your visit, sign up for the New Otani Club. It is free, and a member card will be sent to you, entitling you to separate check-in area, discounts on breakfasts and restaurants, daily newspaper, etc. We used the discount to try out the otherwise quite expensive breakfast on the top floor of the garden tower with its panoramic views of Tokyo (and Mt. Fuji on a clear day). Breakfast is pretty good, although I would not pay full price for it. Eating area is a bit too utilitarian and cafeteria style for the price you pay. But maybe worth it at least once (with NOC discount), just for the views.","Bangkok, Thailand","WClimenhaga</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",36,4.0

Now I live here, and came back for a special occasion.The hotel is near Akasaka-Mitsuke station on the Marunouchi Line and Ginza line of Tokyo metro. Take Exit D at the end of a corridor, but this exit may close about 10pm. From Exit D, go towards the junction and left. The tower of the New Otani is a distinctive shape and if you see it on the web before going you'll find it easily. Lobby is on Floor 6.We had a room on floor 26 and had wonderful views towards Shinjuku. If you are facing in this direction the large wooded area and palace belong to the Geihinkan, where foreign dignitaries are received, and to the Crown Prince's palace.The room itself was a good size for Tokyo and had a large bed (that will vary of course with the rate), electronic safe (would take a modest sized laptop), fridge, desk, TV with international TV channels etc.The bed was very comfortable and the curtains blacked out the light very well. Any quibbles? Well, as a slightly older hotel, while it was well furnished, they could do with power points near the bed, for keeping up with our technology-obsessed times. That's all though. They had free WiFi, which many similar-priced hotels charge for.Good location for exploring Tokyo, wonderful Japanese garden (although the entrance can be tricky to find), and several (not cheap!) restaurants in the garden. Plus a convenience store ... somewhere in the hotel.

My husband and I decided to spend a bit more and stay here. The New Otani has 3 areas for stay: The Zen Executive, The Main and the Garden Tower. The Garden Tower has beautiful views of Tokyo and it's garden and we were given the 28th floor. The room was very clean and spacious (atypical of other standard Hotel rooms in Japan) with good quality toiletries. The view facing the garden was spectacular and that was what made the room. The breakfast on the 40th floor provides a very tasty breakfast buffet of both Western and Japanese fare and it was popular for breakfast because of the view. The Garden Restaurant on the main level(in this case, it's the 6th floor) has the best Garden view as it is slightly elevated from the Garden and provides a great view of the waterfall(this is one of the selling features of staying there). We had dessert there 2 nights and the desserts were delicious. We also had the Kobe steak dinner set at the Rib Steakhouse our last night at dinner and it was very good but it is on the Basement level so there is no view, no windows and dark. It was a special set for people who were staying at the hotel and a bit discounted so a glass of decent champagne and onion soup was included in the meal. We also found that the location was ideal for us as it was only 2-4 stops to any of the major districts and one stop to Rappongi and Ginza taking the Marubouchi Line(Akasaka Mistubashi is the stop for the hotel on the line). If you walked it was a 20 minute walk to Rappongi or Ginza and a 45 minute walk to Tokyo Station. The airport limo bus also picks people up to go to Narita or Haneda(less time availability for Haneda) and the Hotel Bell Captain can arrange for seats that you can charge to your room. The per person cost is 3100Yen to go to Narita and well worth not having to take the subway and train/bus and lugging large pieces of luggage during rush hour in Tokyo. It takes about 90-120 minutes depending on the time of day and they stop at 6 hotels before going to the airport but the ride is very comfortable so give yourself 2 hours for commute. The Bell captain also asks which airline so he can give you the right terminal to get off at and it is written on the baggage tag so that the airport limo driver knows which bags get off at which terminal. It is quite organized like everything in Japan. The reason why I only gave it a 4 star is because the rooms need to be updated in the Garden Tower. While clean and spacious, it looks outdated and a little tired. Also, the stores in Basement level need to be refreshed as the styles in all the stores are old fashioned and matronly and it seemed that no one ever went in any of the stores.The service was a 5+ and everybody spoke English and tried to make our stay effortless. Book longer in advance and take advantage of the hotel deals. If you sign up to be a New Otani member(free membership), there are some discounts you can receive. I believe the New Otani is in 10 other cities in Japan, One in Beijing and one in Honolulu so may be worth signing up. We signed up to get a discount at the breakfast buffet(the membership was immediate once we completed the form) as that was not included in our room price.P.S.

Booked two rooms, both facing in different directions both with amazing views. Check in was quick and efficient. Staff always friendly and welcoming. Hotel is perfectly positioned for nearby metro stations which are very easy to travel through using a Suica card (instructions for buying and topping up in English). This is a large hotel so take some time to look at the shop and restaurant guides in the hotel room. There is a Familymart which stocks everything you could possibly need, or have forgotten. Tullys Coffee house is also very handy and serves a very good value morning set and were particularly accommodating to the vegetarians in our party. The New Otani gardens are stunning and a very pleasant way to start the day with a wander around them. The Travel agent in the hotel called Linda is very helpful at arranging trips and advising on what to see and do. Beds were very comfortable. Water is provided in the good sized room each day. Shampoos etc are of a high quality (Kanebo). Gowns and slippers are provided. There is an in room safe. Tea and coffee making facilities are also in the room.The surrounding area has a variety of restaurants, cafes and shops including the always popular Bic Camera. The hotel is easily reached form the airports by using the Limousine bus which takes you right to the door. We were two couples, 20's and 50's and all enjoyed our stay. We loved the novelty of having a doorbell at each room instead of having to bang on the door!. Another plus was how efficient the lifts were (always important when on a high floor) we never had to wait long for one. All agreed we would definitely return. We have stayed in other Tokyo hotels but this will now be our choice. It was my birthday during the visit and on returning to the room in the evening there was a cake box with tasty cake and lovely message.

It's conveniently located close (c.3 or 4 minutes' walk) to two metro stations. Internet works. You have to ask for an ironing board and iron, but it does arrive.I don't often notice such things but the Garden Lounge, the main breakfast restaurant, has a genuinely relaxing and pleasant ambience. The hotel's gardens are beautiful.One downside is that there is a significant additional charge to use the health club. There is a free-to-use gym, but it is tiny (4 or 5 machines). This factor is the main reason why I have knocked off a star.There's something else about the New Otani that works on a more subjective level. It has a 1960s faded glamour about it - half-close your eyes, and you can almost see David Niven chatting to Twiggy in the lobby. This adds absolutely nothing tangible to my work trip.

'The Main' seems to be in excellent condition but the 'Garden Tower' rooms are rather jaded for what purports to be a 5-star hotel. The beautiful Japanese garden setting is glorious within the hustle and bustle of Tokyo city but hardly makes up for the outlandish pricing of food and drink within the hotel......see a price then add 10% service charge.....THEN add 8% 'consumption tax' (V.A.T. to us in the UK) so add 18.8% to everything that you might drink or eat. Sadly we purchased just two drinks on our first night until we had 'orientated' ourselves and never drank or eat in the hotel after that. Fortunately it is just a 4-5 minute walk to many outside eateries. Access to Tokyo Metro is just 3-4 minutes away but if you walk to Asakusa make certain that you use the Garden Tower entrance.....walking from/to 'The Main' entrance takes 4-5 times as long and is uphill all the way back (it's a shame they don't tell you this at reception but perhaps you are expected to use taxis to get 500 yards 'as the crow flies' to get to the Metro entrance?).,"Norfolk, United Kingdom","njnb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norfolk, United Kingdom</strong>",91,3.0

The hotel definitely needs updating. The rooms are small, the radio, clock, etc. in the room is still analog. For example, the clock is facing the same direction as you are sleeping and is on the dresser next to the bed. In order to see it -- you can't unless you sit up! It's little things like that. The bathroom is very small and the shower looks and feels old. The staff is VERY friendly and helpful though. There are plenty of help in the hotel and they always have a smile. The dining options are incredible. With so many options of places to dine, it is overwhelming. As are the shops. Most of course are overpriced for tourists. Japan is VERY expensive so be prepared to pay for everything. For example, $28USD for eggs Benedict. $33USD for a bowl of beef curry.The ONLY thing I would suggest you visit is the Japanese Garden. It is beautiful and shouldn't be missed. They have a waterfall feature, along with some koi and most of the small restaurants are through the garden.

It also has a mini-frig, a hot water pot, free instant coffee, green tea, plum tea, back tea. Free Wi-Fi. Plenty of towels, bath robes, kimonos, soft slippers. The usual soap, shampoo, conditioner, body soap, hand soap; a bit unusual: foldable brush, razor, bubble bath, cotton swabs. The shampoo, conditioner and body soap are from a nice Japanese brand; they smell nice and leave skin clean and soft.The hotel is very traditional Japanese. After check-in, a hotel staff brings your luggages and show you to your room. My preschooler was also gave a small toy as welcome gift. Ice is brought to your room upon calling housekeeping; so are iron and ironing board. Free daily newspaper (English or Japanese).Now the best part is the location of this hotel, we have a preschooler and sometimes, we just want to have a snack or a light dinner at hotel room. No problem. There are 2 on-site convenience stores. One store is called Family Mart which opens 7am to 11pm. It is located on the 2nd floor of the Garden Court building. It is like 7-11. It has drinks and food. Food includes breakfast pastries, Japanese chips and snacks AND prepared meals like fresh ramen noodles, udon, curry rice, BBQ chicken stews, salads and more. They will microwave the hot food for you. Must try is the frozen ice cream cone; it is made from Hokkaido milk. The other store is on the 1st floor of the same building. It is more of a traditional Japanese small grocery store with prepared meals, high-end fruits; for example, $15 watermelon that is rated on sweetness level; $50 for a small basket of grapes that are from a special part of Japan. We tried the $1 tiny Mandarin orange which was so sweet and smelled so fresh. They also have high-end souvenir Japanese crackers/cakes which you cannot buy at the Narita airport. We saw a lot of office workers go there to grab lunch. Note that the Garden Court building that it is in is actually an office building.Outside of the hotel, you are 5 mins walk away from 3 streets full of Japanese restaurants. Lotsa choices but lacking in ""Take Out"". I would say 99% Dine-in; except McD and First Kitchen.Now, let's talk about the distance of this hotel from different tourist locations like Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku, Akihabara, Ginza. I would rate that it is a fair location. It is about a $20-$25 each way Taxi fare from each of the above locations except for Akihabara which was about $30-$35. Note that a train ride is only approx. $3 per person each way; children under 6 is free. Taxi can seat 4 and stroller is free to store in trunk.Now, let's talk about the cleanliness of the room. We were shocked to find that the carpet is super clean. We spilled a glass of water and clean it up with white towels and the towels remained white; not a speck of dirt? How is that possible? May be because they provide slippers for guest?Also, we watched the house cleaning lady cleaned the sinks and she was very detailed; the spouts are spotless and shiny front and back and top and under. All the glasses that they provided are spotless and look brand new; also individually wrapped in clear plastic. The only thing that does not look 'new' is the sofa; it had a lint issue. Other than that, I would say this hotel room was 9.5 out of 10 in cleanliness.Overall, I would recommend this place for family with small children who needs a clean and central location to stay with easy access to quality food source.","Woodinville, Washington","tmelon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Woodinville, Washington</strong>",2,5.0

The hotel has shops, many restaurants (different types of Japanese cuisine, also French style); some of the restaurants are in the garden and look nice. Unfortunately menus are really expensive compared to the restaurants you can find around in the area of the hotel. I really appreciated sushi restaurant in the Bizz Tower which is at a distance of 15 minutes walking. I just had a Japanese and international buffet breakfast one morning to be able to appreciate the view on Tokyo, and another day a breakast on the ground floor with the view on the Japanese garden; but did not take a chance to try the restaurants for lunch or dinner because they were too expensive. Furthermore, you have to have to add 8% of taxes to the bill so be careful!There is a small bar on 40th floor to appreciate the night view on Tokyo, but I did not like my cocktail.Staff is really nice and helpful at front desk.Rooms are clean and comfortable. I had a beautiful suite on 27 th floor wih the view on Tokyo; the bathroom was Japanese style, that is to say with a shower to wash yourself with a small bank apart from the tub, and also a bath tub. Toilets were apart from the bathroom.Small water bottles, green and oolong tea bags, instant coffee, are available for free, with also a water boiler.Nice kimonos and bath robes are also available for free; the good thing with Japanese hotels is that they offer toothbrush, and other useful things like hairbrush, cotton ear tips, etc...The hotel offers massages in your room for around 50 euros (50 minutes at least); did not have time to try it!Laundry service is excellent.I had a really funny and surprising experience when I decided to go to the swimming pool around 18:00-19:00 during August : the swimming pool was open to non-customers, and was invaded with a crowd of young Tokyo beautiful and young people showing off around the pool! You can see mostly girls wearing last tendance swimming suits, chatting, and of course not swimming! It was impossible to swim and was like more or less a fashion défilé. Furthermore, I was eaten by mosquitos which are really tremendous in Tokyo during summer time!The spa is really expensive beacuse you have to pay an entrance fee.My recommendation is that is that you ask for your New Otani membership card on the hotel website before your arrival, so you can benefit from more attention, like newspaper in the room and access to the swimming pool for free.","Brussels, Belgium","Bianca A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brussels, Belgium</strong>",64,4.0

Basically, the New Otani Tokyo is a vast complex consisting of the hotel, several restaurants and bars, a garden and a large underground shopping arcade. Considered purely as a hotel, I was slightly disappointed. The rooms were large by Japanese standards, everything was clean and the service was good, but it did all feel slightly dated. Also, the size of the hotel can be annoying in itself, because you often have to do a lot of walking just to get out of the complex. On the other hand, the garden is amazing, access to the pool is free with New Otani Club membership, there are some nice opportunities for shopping and ""The Bar"" on the 40th floor of the tower was just spectacular. Great view of the Tokyo Tower, especially at night, wide selection of drinks and snacks and amazing service. Many (most, in fact) of the other bars and restaurants were overpriced in my opinion, though.To sum up, I would say that if you get a good deal on the room (as we did), the New Otani is a nice hotel, especially if you like the idea of having everything in one place. It does have some significant flaws, though.

I really found only one negative and that was the feeling I was being charged well over the odds for any sort of food or drinks. 27 USD for a burger or 28 for pasta at the bottom end seems like a rip off unless you are the Ritz. Some restaurants offer top-end Japanese food at 200 - 300 USD per meal. Drinks in bars are pricey (19 USD for a Mai Tai) and for a hotel that large many venues were strangely empty.

Enormous is the choice of top level restaurants in the hotel, you should try at least one of the Japanese. Food is of the best quality here, as you can expect also expensive. For not so expensive options you can go for an enjoyable walk in the Akasaka district, where you will find lots of restaurants only a few steps from the hotel. Breakfast is served on the top floors, where the view alone makes worth the high price. To pay a bit less it is useful to ask in advance for the free New Otani Club membership, which also gives you free access to the outdoor swimming pool.

So we called the front desk and within 20 minutes they switched us to an equal-sized but updated and clean-smelling room ten floors lower.The room was decent sized, similar to any big-city hotel room I've stayed in. Very quiet, no sound from outside or next door rooms. The bed was a bit hard and bouncy, but it seemed like a marshmallow compared to the futons we had been sleeping on in the previous week. Some of the furniture was new, some was older but in decent condition.The hotel property is huge and includes a bunch of fancy stores and restaurants, it all has a somewhat dated 60s/70s Vegas-y luxury vibe (but it's all in very good condition). We only ate at one of the restaurants once, the garden cafe - we had burgers and they were big and good, but they were nearly $30 each. We never tried the breakfast or any other of their restaurants; instead when we wanted a cheaper light breakfast or lunch/snack nearby, we went to the Sunroser building next door (it's connected via a short walkway from the garden tower lobby) where there's a Tully's coffee on the 2nd floor, and a small deli/market on the 1st floor. Other notes:- You can sign up for a free Otani club membership on the spot when checking in to save 20% on breakfast.- On-room wifi is free (seems like a recent change) and it worked fine.- There are many bars and restaurants only a few blocks away in the Akasaka neighborhood. We had a nice shabu-shabu meal at ""Shabugen"" which is on the 5th floor above the McDonalds.- The Akasaka-Mitsuke metro stop is a block away.- The app ""Tokyo Subway Navigation for Tourists"" was extremely helpful for using the subway. Aside from a map, it will show you the closest station, and if you plug in the start and end stations, it will show you where to change if needed, how long the trip will take, and how much to pay.- If you're going to be using the metro more than a few times, it's worthwhile to buy a Suica or Pasmo card which you can tap to ride the metro (and use to buy drinks at many vending machines).

The sprawling hotel comprises a 17 storey so-called Main hotel and a 40 storey Garden Tower separated by nearly 100 metres of corridor. I haven't stayed in the tower for a couple of years, but back then it had large rooms, sparsely furnished, with the hardest beds I've ever experienced. The Main hotel block rooms are far smaller, more recently refurbished, and with beds which help overcome jet lag rather than reduce your chances of sleep. Whichever block you choose, the bathrooms are small - and of course come equipped with the ubiquitous electric lavatory. Press the wrong button and you'll self induce colonic irrigation, and it's worth learning how to turn off the seat warmer.The complex - for that is what it is - is built on the side of a hill. This makes it quite confusing. The lobby floor of the Main hotel is on the equivalent floor to the 6th floor of the Tower (so the Tower lobby is on the 6th floor). There are restaurants and shops all over the place. The hotel is a hive of activity during the day - navigating the wide, shop-lined corridor between the two parts of the hotel is rather like walking down a busy street - yet turns into a wasteland at about 8.30 at night.There are several places to take breakfast. On a sunny day, opting for continental breakfast allows you to eat in the Garden restaurant - half way along the 100 metre corridor separating the Main from the Garden Tower. The huge picture windows overlook a 10 acre Japanese garden, complete with red bridge, rock garden and fairly sizeable waterfall. It looks less polished when you walk round it, but from the breakfast room it is a spectacular oasis of peace over which to gaze while eating your beakfast.We also had breakfast in the more popular, larger, and rather dismal breakfast room in the Main hotel. While the choice is good, the atmosphere is oppressive and the seating arrangements so convoluted that they contrive to create a 10 minute queue for a half empty restaurant at 06.00.Over the last couple of visits I have eaten in a couple of the hotel's Japanese restaurants, including the really excellent Kyubey sushi restaurant. The Sky Bar is a different matter. Service is pitifully slow, the ambience is uninviting (which is why the lights are virtually on ""off""), and the view is completely spoiled by the distraction of the revolving restaurant which circles the bar.For the record, over the years I have found the service in the hotel to be solid if somewhat slow. This time they struggled to cope with the fact that I arrived with my wife rather than just alone as my booking indicated. What should have been a two minute rate adjustment took 15 minutes to resolve. This time round the bed had hairs in it: it happens in hotels; they were very apologetic; but it took two people an inordinate amount of time to remake the bed at 11.00 at night.It's absolutely not a five star experience, but it is reliable and - for Tokyo - reasonably priced for what you get (25,000 Yen per day including breakfast).",United Kingdom,"D j R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United Kingdom</strong>",133,4.0

We made the reservation for a Friday night, and I was told (in writing) that the base price for dinner would be JPY9,505 per person. On Friday afternoon I had a work meeting and needed to change my reservation to the following night (Saturday). We showed up on Saturday; view was ok but nothing great. Food was decent. Then the bill came. We were charged JPY 15,444 per person. When I pointed out that this was not what we had been quoted, I was told that this was the holiday price (effective Saturday but not Friday). I thought it was a bit unprofessional that no one had pointed this out when I changed my reservation but we decided not to let it ruin our night.I gave the waiter my credit card, which was a Citibank American Express from Singapore. (we are expats living in Singapore). After awhile, the waiter came over and asked me to come and enter my pin. I told him, there is no pin because it's a credit card, not debit. He then said my card didn't work and we needed to provide another. My finance gave him her Citibank American Express card, also from Singapore (from her own account). She was also told her card didn't work. This was extremely strange to us since we had been using both cards the whole trip, all over Japan. We then each provided our Citibank Singapore Visa cards. They ""did not work"" either. When we said that we thought there must be a problem with the credit card machine at New Otani, and asked if they could manually key in the numbers or run it at another machine, our waiter became increasingly agitated and told us we needed to provide another card. He was repeating ""Your card not working!"" aggressively which to both me and my fiance felt like he was implying we had done something wrong or we did not really have money behind our cards, which could not be further from the truth. At this point we had provided 4 cards. We had also stopped enjoying our dessert and coffee to come deal with the situation. It was embarrassing to us and many guests saw what was happening. Another manager came back to our table and took a manual imprint of the card. We then left. However, the following day, I got an email from my WORK COLLEAGUE based in Singapore. The New Otani had actually emailed my WORK saying that our cards still didn't work and the balance from dinner was outstanding. They asked my work colleague to ask if I could come back to the hotel and pay cash. Now we were really infuriated. They got my colleague's work email from my away email address which said ""for urgent / emergency matters please contact ____"", and they had my email address because this is how I originally made my reservation. CLEARLY the dinner was a non-business matter and also a non-emergency matter; furthermore my cell phone was working just fine and that number was also listed on every correspondence I had with New Otani. Now my office has received emails which imply that my fiance and I don't have working credit cards. I was incredibly shocked that they would abuse my work ""away"" email auto message, particularly when they had my cell phone number and my cell phone worked fine. We called Citibank immediately who assured us all of our cards had ample credit and they saw no problem on their side.The entire situation just ruined the end of our Tokyo trip and I will never be eating here again. For a 5 star restaurant and hotel, it's just unacceptable to me. The service was that of a 2- or 3-star. Employees not knowing how to use their own credit card machines or trouble-shoot situations professionally is not ok for how much you're paying. On other notes the view is completely sub-par.","Singapore, Singapore","sjb418</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",16,1.0

And because of the hotel’s excellent location it is very easy to go out for a drink or meal, as it is a stone’s throw from the Akasaka district (and metro station should you want to go further afield) where there are ample different restaurants to suit all tastes and pockets. To walk to the Akasaka area it is quicker to leave the hotel by the Garden Tower entrance rather than the main entrance as it saves a walk round the block.Our room in the hotel (in the Garden Tower Block) was more spacious than I had expected in a Tokyo hotel, with enough room for storage and suitcases. It was clean, comfortable and well serviced with towels changed every day. The bathroom was also the best we had during a tour in Japan, with a showerhead that could change the direction of jet, bars of soap, small bottles of shampoo and conditioner plus face clothes – all of which were lacking in other hotels we stayed in.Breakfast in the hotel is also good, with a reasonable selection of hot western style dishes, Japanese dishes and fresh fruit. (Although I found this never-varied selection was much the same in other hotels we subsequently visited and consequently became a little boring, but it was probably better here than other hotels we stayed at). Breakfast can be taken at one of several restaurants, but the main two for western breakfasts are the rooftop restaurant in the Garden Tower, and the central ground floor Garden restaurant (there is another Japanese restaurant if you want a Japanese breakfast). These open at 7pm and there is invariably a queue, particularly at the rooftop restaurant where great views over Tokyo can be had from window tables. If you want a window table here for an early breakfast you would need to get there by about 6.45, otherwise just before 7.30 when, although still usually a (shorter) queue, you will get the first arrivals starting to leave. The Garden restaurant is more airy and has a greater capacity, but again you should be there just before 7 for an early breakfast to get a table overlooking the superb gardens. For us, this was the more comfortable and relaxing of the two. (Incidentally, the attractive gardens and pools full of Koi carp are well worth walking round).Drinks are expensive (1000 yen plus for a small beer). The lobby floor Capri bar (near the main lobby) is a bit soulless with more serving staff than customers when we went (I noted 6 attentive serving staff for us and another couple), while Trader Vic’s bar (the only other we tried) was equally pricey but had a better atmosphere being decorated out in a Disney-like South Sea Island style. It also serves snacks in the bar.Overall we thought the hotel very good, reasonably priced for the size and style of hotel it is, and met our needs in all respects, although we did eat and drink out after the first night.","Gravesend, United Kingdom","malabarfly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gravesend, United Kingdom</strong>",576,4.0

(The hotel is so large that there's a separate page for reviews of the hotel's ""new"" ""Zen"" wing.)My room was meticulously maintained (everything worked) and quite clean. However, the decor was outdated. How outdated? Well, the knobs and switches on the bedside control stand are definite throwbacks to an earlier era. I likewise dislike the green upholstery on the room chairs. Plus the bed's mattress was firm and took some getting used to. I had an LCD TV (from the early 2000s it looked like) with an adequate (but not great) selection of English language channels, including CNN and BBC. All the usual suspects (except for complimentary bottled water) were present (i.e. safe, closet and hangers, mini-bar, luggage rack, etc.) as well. Finally, at 27 sqm. or so, the room was of a sufficient size for one person.The bath was okay. Sure, not as nicely laid-out, designed or large as some hotel bath's I've had the pleasure to use but still okay. Shower and tub combination rather than a stand-alone shower in the bath. In addition, the bath had a low ceiling and I'm only of average height. However, it did have a hand-held shower with different spray settings and I did like the Japanese ""scene"" done in tile on the wall of the bath. Toiletries were more or less complete. However, you get body wash rather than bath soap and I think they were a ""house"" brand rather than a well known Japanese, European or American one. I should mention breakfast. You can take it at 4 different restaurants. There's a Japanese restaurant serving a traditional Japanese breakfast, two restaurants offering full western buffets (the first in the 40th floor Italian restaurant of the Garden Wing and the second in the all-day dining restaurant located on the ground floor of the new wing) and one restaurant offering a continental buffet located along the passage between the new and garden wings. As expected, the 40th floor restaurant was busier, since it offers great views of the city. However, the restaurant in the new wing offered much, much better variety and, dare I say it, much better quality as well. I tried the Japanese breakfast during my first day and I can say that it's definitely worth having at least once. I did not try the continental buffet.Service wise, I didn't really have any cause to complain. The bellman even insisted on giving us a tour or briefing of our rooms, pointing out all the controls and what not. The staff spoke English with different levels of proficiency, with the aforementioned bellman sounding almost like a native speaker. I also very much like that Japan doesn't have a tipping culture.

The location was reasonably convenient in the sense that it was about 8 - 10 minutes walk from the Yotsuya Train and Metro Station. The hotel with its two towers was quite large and it was quite a walk just to get from the front door back to the Garden Tower. There were at least three restaurants and several shops in the lower lobby level. There were also several other restaurants on site such that one would never have to leave the hotel for variety if they did not want to do so. The check-in went very smoothly and efficiently. I was quite happy with my room as it was very spacious, even by Western standards, and also very clean. The amenities worked well. The internet was plug-in but functioned quite sufficiently for my needs. The morning breakfast was quite good in the Garden Room with a full buffet on weekends and a continental buffet (salad, bread, fruit, yogurt, juices, etc.) on weekdays. The rate for the hotel was very reasonable for what I paid and a better value than any other hotel at which I have stayed in Tokyo in a similar price range.

The wedding at the hotel was a truly memorable experience and it was not until we attended at the wedding did we realise just how big the hotel actually is. All in all we had a great time at the hotel. The only downside is that it is incredibly expensive to eat and drink at the hotel - in our view prohibitively so. The pool was also expensive to use ( although it seems that if you join the Otani business club you might be able to use the pool at a reduced rate according to other guests) and very crowded as it is open to the public - not quite what we had expected really.

It was clean. The bed was comfortable (apart from a very unusual bedding setup, a duvet folded into a very oversized bedsheet). There were two pillows provided (a rarity from our other experiences), one firm and one soft. The bathroom had a bath with stand-up shower. Overall, very happy with the room, except one thing...We had a no smoking room. However, it was not a no smoking floor, which seems a ludicrous decision by the hotel to do this. The room still smelled of smoke as, surprise surprise, the smell seeped through the door frame and whenever the door was opening (e.g. during housekeeping / room cleaning). While more faint than had we been in a smoking room, it was still unpleasant to have that smell lingering in the room.On check-in, the front desk had the wrong dates for our stay, having us down for three nights rather than four. They were quick to rectify the situation by checking with their booking agent (we had booked and paid via our Avios airmiles so hadn't booked directly). A minor inconvenience but nothing too bad.The location is good in that it's very close to a metro station (Akasaka Mitsuke). There are lots of restaurants and bars nearby, ranging from the cheap (250 yen noodles) to expensive, so there really is no shortage of options for dinner or drinks. However, if you're in Tokyo sightseeing you will need to travel - there is very little of cultural interest within a short walking distance, e.g. no large temples or shrines, no large gardens or parks. However, this is not a problem as the metro is very convenient and runs well. The only time the location would be a problem is if you were wanting to be out late (after the metro stops) each night, this could get expensive in taxi fares depending on where you will spend your nights/mornings.The gardens attached to the hotel are pretty and worth a little walk around, but you won't need more than 30-minutes here - they're not large.A big failure is that there is no free wifi, anywhere in the hotel. In your room there is wifi available, but for a mildly extortionate fee. In this day and age this is inexcusable. I expect wifi to be provided, and for free, in all but the most basic and cheap accomodation. For example, we stayed in two ""Monterey"" hotel chain venues (Tokyo Akasaka and Kyoto) and both had free wifi throughout the entire hotel.Overall, I'd rate the hotel 3 out of 5 for a few reasons.-While the room was large, clean and comfortable, the smell of smoke in a supposedly no smoking room was unpleasant.-For what you get, the price is (I believe) too high. You get absolutely nothing but the room. No bottled water, no biscuits with your tea, no wifi, nothing. As such, it feels like it's geared towards business visitors rather than holidaymakers.-While there are lots of bars and restaurants attached to the hotel, they are all vastly overpriced. Again, this makes the place feel geared towards business travellers. Not a big problem as there are lots of restaurants and bars near the hotel.-A mistake on check-in, telling us we had booked (and paid for) one night less than we had, is not something I expect from an expensive or well run hotel, even though it was resolved quickly.",London,"Tom L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",65,3.0

Quality double room in the main building which was very nice, spacious, clean and well serviced and free wifi (good in room, sadly lacking elsewhere in building). There are a number of bars and restaurants within the hotel complex although the position of the hotel gives you a huge choice within a 5 minutes walk outside.

If you stay in the New New Otani you will be happy, maybe. If you stay in the old New Otani not so much. The old one, where I ended up is called the same name but I ended up in the Garden Tower. It has older rooms, kind of OK but a little bit in need of renovation and a bit not so nice feeling.The bathrooms are quite old, and the beds a bit on the saggy side. The help is way below what you expect in a nice Japanese business hotel. First, beware, some of the rooms do not have wifi, at least not when I was here. The first room had none, so after I unpacked I headed down to the front desk, and only then did they inform me I would have to repack and have another room on another floor. No sorry. Later, when I asked for a map and location it was all the bell desk could do but to mumble a few words and clearly wanted no further talking with me.The restaurant at the top of the Main Building, the New New Otani, that turns, has a deal of around $100 USD for not very good food at all. Stay away from this place for dinner! The breakfast on the other hand in the new building has a great buffet that comes with the room. Coffee for two in the coffee shop betwen the two buildings was $15 per person for a cup of coffee. Quite ridiculous. We wanted to just share a spread sheet and it cost $30.In short, you can do so much better and the location is kind of off the beaten path in Akasaka although it is right across from the Metro stop Akasaka Mitsuke.","Tucson, Arizona","zabriskibound</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>",437,3.0

It has two wings, the more salubrious Main Building and the newer Garden Tower and these are interconnected by an arcade containing shops and restaurants. Lobby decor is a bit 'arte nouveau' influenced. We stayed in the Garden Tower on the 22nd floor, the room was comfortable and had a great view across to the Tokyo Tower that is lit up colourfully at night. The hotel service was impeccable. As indicated by many reviewers the real unique feature of this hotel is its Japanese Garden complete with a large waterfull and walking around this is a real treat, particularly in central Tokyo. Along the arcade is a bar and tea house and you can sit in the afternoon and admire the Garden from above with a drink in hand. The major frustration of the hotel is the cost of all the add-ons. There is no WiFi in the room but internet is available via cable for ~1500 yen for 24h and this then gives you access to WiFi in the lobby and arcade. The outdoor swimming pool, adjacent to the Garden, is very nice but costs 2000 yen for guests and was quite busy on the hot summer day we visited. Breakfast is expensive and I would recommend that your purchase fruit and pastries at the Sakogami food shop on level 1 in the shopping centre below the Garden Tower if you want a cheaper option. The hotel is very well situated next to subway stations and if you walk down the hill, over the bridge and across the road there is a street of restaurants to chose from, where we found magnificent made to order Sushi. The central location of the hotel means that many of Tokyo's important sites, e.g. Imperial Palace, are close by. All in all we really enjoyed our stay here, sure it is a bit old and not a big new glamour hotel but the New Otani has some features, like its garden, that cannot be matched elsewhere.","Brisbane, Australia","GingerCheetah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",27,4.0

But it offers great value. We stayed in the cheapest room type, a standard room in the Garden Tower, but there was nothing wrong with it. It was big enough, certainly for Tokyo, with a great view, quiet, ok beds, good shower. It is a bit old, but everything is in working condition. Even the beds were big enough, and we are quite tall (6'1 and 6'4 / 185 and 192 cm).The service in the hotel is impeccable. Everybody speaks at least some English, even the cleaning staff greets guests in English. Service of the bell boys is also great; they escort you to your room with your luggage which I like much better than the usual procedure in US hotels where you sometimes have to wait for 15 minutes or more in your room before your luggage gets there.Special mention for Ms Takahata of Guest Relations / what one would call a concierge in the US. Our purpose for visiting Tokyo was to eat some of its great Japanese restaurants, but unfortunately it is very hard to get reservations if you do not speak Japanese. Ms Takahata made all the reservations for me, including ones that could only be made a month in advance and thus she scheduled to contact the restaurant on my behalf on exactly the right date without any reminder from me. She also provided a letter with reservation details upon arrival at the hotel and excellent directions on how to get there.There is no Wifi in the hotel, put the wired internet for 1260 Yen per day worked very well and considering the low rate that's not bad.

I rolled in on the airport limo bus from Haneda (I don't recommend that if you are a) coming to the international terminal b) are familiar with using trains in tokyo and c)traveling light given all the different airport terminal stops) and it pulled up at 11pm to a large, empty hall with an escalator leading up to check in. I had booked a cheaper room in the Garden Tower, and so after the fairly rapid check-in was escorted by a very personable porter to my room down a long hallway to the Garden Tower. The room itself was clean, functional, of average size and to be honest fairly unremarkable, except for the pretty blue bathroom tile murals which was a nice touch. The bed was very comfortable, the yukatas and slippers were great, and I slept like a baby both nights. I also always like the complimentary salty plum tea which was one of many options. I am sure the Main Building rooms are much more luxurious as previous reviewers have commented.There is a typical paid-for gym in the hotel, with spa and sauna facilities. Used to travelling in Asia outside Japan though I couldn't bring myself to pay for that and used the small gym in the Garden Tower. Very basic, with a few cardio machines and some free weights, but it did the job.What impressed me about the hotel were the sheer number, scale and variety of restaurants in the hotel, including three separate bakeries. The patisserie in the front of the hotel is highly rated by guests and locals alike, but I actually quite like the pastries at Aux Bacchanales at the street level just outside the Garden Tower ground floor entrance (their steak frites was quite tasty too!). I ate at the Lounge area between the Garden Tower and the Main Building for breakfast, which was a limited continental breakfast one day. That was perfectly alright (I can never have enough Japanese yoghurt, living in Hong Kong) but a fairly limited selection with no real hot foods. I would have loved to have tried some of the fancier places but being by myself I was going to save it for a return trip.The location of the hotel is pretty good, not too far away from a number of different subway lines, and very much within striking distance of both the business districts and the shops of Shibuya, Aoyama, and Omotesando.

For a hotel of this magnitude I was expecting a bit more. Being our first trip to Japan and Tokyo itself, we didn't exactly get the friendliest of welcome from their staff, not something you need in the morning after a very long flight. Apart from the level of customer service not being up to scratch, their english was also not so great. Especially when I asked not one, but a few of their staff a really basic question and when they couldn't give me a straight answer I was really quite shocked. In the end, I managed to figure out the answer to my own question, without their help.We stayed in the Garden Tower for four nights. The twin room here was quite spacious and modern. We had a nice view of the the skyline at night and when the day cleared we were pleasantly surprised that our room also had a view of Mt Fuji. This was by far the most expensive hotel we stayed in on our Japan trip and the only one that did not offer either free wi-fi or internet access. Although I knew this prior to booking, it got me thinking that if the other hotels which I stayed at, where we paid much less for, were able to either provide us with free wi-fi or computers to access the internet in the lobby- why can't Otani? This is something very handy when you're trying to look for something in Tokyo and communicating with the staff is just way too frustrating.I chose to stay in this hotel because it seemed to be located in the centre of all the places we were planning to visit, plus my friend wanted to see a beautiful Japanese garden and express check-in is offered to their members. On the morning we arrived, all the rooms were fully booked, there was a wedding on that day and it was during cherry blossom season, so it was understandable that we couldn't get express check-in. (FYI: If you do plan to stay here, sign up for their free membership card, it helps, a little).In terms of location it is not so bad. To access the hotel we used the Akasaka-mitsuke station, which is a short walk from the Garden Tower. On the orange Ginza line it was the G5 stop and the on red Marunouchi line it was the M13 stop (note: these lines are the Tokyo Metro line which are not covered by the JR pass if you intend on purchasing one). The station is near other shopping and dining areas such as Roppongi Hills, Tokyo Midtown and if high-end designer label shopping is your thing, Ginza and Ometesando are not far from this station. However, if you're on a budget or you just want to be located in the heart of the action, then you are best to base yourself in either Shibuya or Shinjuku which is exactly what I'll do next time I'm there. These places are amazing at night and have a great energy to them. Plus there are plenty of restaurants, shops and entertainment to choose from in contrast to the neighbourhood around Otani which is rather quiet with a demographic of mostly business workers. Sure, the hotel has it's own restaurants, but if you haven't made any reservations then you could always go for a little explore into your neighbourhood like we did for dinner. We ate at Akasaka Square Dining, the food there was pretty average as reflected in the price. We also had a rather healthier version of the American buffet breakfast at the Garden Lounge located at Otani's Main Tower. This lounge had really nice views of the garden and we could imagine how spectacular it would have been had the cherry blossoms been in full bloom, but unfortunately at the time, they were just beginning to bud.","Brisbane, Australia","osmosis12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",15,3.0

There were many Restaurents nearby which was great as the only downer on this place was the Restaurent prices they were incredibly expensive and you could eat just as good for about 25/30% of the price outside the Hotel. This Hotel would have scored 5 if it had some moderate priced Dining facilities and a good Bar.","Yateley, UK","UKsteve_9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yateley, UK</strong>",3,4.0

This is not our normal airline crew hotel, but due to an issue at our normal hotel, we were substituted here. The FIRST thing that you have to get your arms around is the sheer size of this hotel property.. It's huge.. The hotel consists of three major buildings plus one of the largest private hotel gardens in Tokyo. When you first arrive you really don't get a sense of just how large it is.. Check-in was a bit complex as the Otani's Credit Office had to communicate with my airline's billing office (it's a pre-paid room) to confirm payment arrangements. In typical Japanese service style, rather than being left standing at the check-in counter waiting, our bags were taken by the Bell Staff and we were shown to the adjacent lounge and offer a fruit juice drink while we waited for the details to be worked out.. This, in itself, is a small event, but is in my opinion a good representation of what level of service the Otani delivers..Within :15 were were assigned rooms and escorted with our bags by the Bell Staff. Rooms in the lower and older Main Building are priced a little cheaper than rooms in the newer, taller Garden Court/Tower buildings. Luckily we were assigned rooms in the Garden Tower building. It takes a solid :10 to get from the Front Desk to our rooms-- an indication as to the sheer size of this hotels property.The room itself is typically Asian, in that it's small. Nicely furnished with darker, cooling colors with dark natural wood trim. As you would expect, all the furnishings are top-rate like the plasma TV, work desk with multi-line phone, multi-power outlet, high-speed internet connection, data ports, coffee/tea serviette, iron and ironing board and room slippers and plush teri-cloth bath robe. The windows are nearly floor to ceiling and provide on of the best views in a city hotel I've ever seen. The drapes are not ""black-out"" but do shut out a substantial percentage of the natural light when closed. The room also has one leather sitting chair and coffee table. I turn the chair to face the city view.Like the bedroom, the bathroom is also noticeably small but also very well equipped. Full toiletries provided, tub and shower. Anti-fog mirror, radio and telephone for those who need to make or receive a call from the bathroom. A wall-mounted hair dryer is also included. Nice strong water pressure and very hot water.As expected everything in my room was in working order and it was cleaned to an immaculate standard.The hotel itself is like a semi-city. For the first-time guest, you may get temporarily lost. The hotel has two large pool, a full gym with classes and free weights/machinery, a day-salon and a day-spa. The hotels private Japanese waling garden is NOT to be missed. You can get a guide so you can better understand the symbolism of the gardens and the native plants as well.You won't be at a loss for eating options either: Japanese, Western, Chinese, French/Pastry, Cafe and Bar/Lounge are all available. They do also offer 24/7 room service at typical room service rates. The hotel is so centrally located in the Chiyoda-ku district that there are literally hundreds of eating and drinking options withing a short walk or subway ride from the hotel.I can't say enough about this hotel.. It's sheer size and level of amenities are unrivaled. I do know that it is not cheap by any measure, but in my opinion, for the location, the level of amenities and guest services it's a good value. But for me it's the staff politeness, promptness and overall level of guest satisfaction that make it a winner for me!","Bangkok, Thailand","GOPBI</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",254,5.0

Heaps of restaurants and shops, very busy but a good place to kick off trip to Japan when you know nothing! Easy to get everywhere, close to metro. Room was slightly jaded but clean and comfortable. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Disappointing to have to pay for internet (100 yen for 10 min) in such a hotel but seems to be everywhere in Japan. Even when it froze and I lost the money they would not give a free session, had to pay again.","Cambridge, United Kingdom","Gbrux</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, United Kingdom</strong>",53,4.0
