However, when a different part of our trip was cancelled at the last minute, the hotel had a room available so we thought we’d try them out.The hotel and its staff are second to none! It’s definitely one of the loveliest places to stay in Tokyo! Our room was large by Japanese standards, with an opulent bathroom and all the amenities one could possibly want. We stayed on the 33rd floor, and the view across Tokyo was wonderful, a real treat! I can’t put into words how friendly and polite all the hotel staff are. They really go above and beyond.The location of this hotel is also great, particularly if you’re in Tokyo for 4 or 5 nights. It’s adjacent to Shibuya Station, which is a perfect departure point to get anywhere in Tokyo and beyond.My only small niggle is that they make you pay for access to the pool and gym. This seems out of place for a luxury hotel, particularly one where everything else is included.

But there’s a cheap bus service to Haneda (1030 yen) / Narita airport (3100 yen) right next to the hotel.At check-in no deposit was held, just card details were added on file. Final payment was made upon check out.My neighbors next door were party guys, I could hear them in the hall, but not in my room, so I could relax and enjoy the silence.The room was quite small but there’s a small storage room for the luggage, that’s very comfortable.There’s an air cleaner in the room. Hotel offers an interesting ladies kit consists of cleansing gel, washing essence, lotion and cream - all of them were high quality products and really good on skin. All amenities are fully refreshed every day: even if I used just a half bottle of shampoo, I’ll additionally get a new one.Ventilation system is poor in the shower. You need to close bathroom door before taking a shower to avoid fire alert.However mirror is heated in the middle, so it’s not steamed up in the middle even after a long hot shower.There’s a nice typical Japanese toilet with a control panel (seat heating, bidet, shower).It was disappointing that I didn’t find any hook in the bathroom to hang on my wet towel or a bathrobe. The only shelf there is for dry towels, the bathroom itself is very small. Towels soak up the water really good and are very soft.Quality of sleep was perfect: soft blanket, comfortable mattress and choice of pillows - we took memory foam pillows.Room service food was average and quite expensive, but you can order it 24/7. You can find better and cheaper options outside.Tea (300 yen) and coffee (400 yen) in the room for extra cost. Gym and swimming pool access are also for extra cost.Hotel staff is great and very helpful. Concierge answered all my questions (I had plenty) and booked tickets to the flowers park in advance.I really enjoyed my stay and hope to come back.","Athens, Greece","Svetlana R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Athens, Greece</strong>",41,5.0

Check-in is fast and efficient, lifts will take you really quick to your room. We booked an Executiv room which we were really glad we did. It was fairly large in size with a very comfortable bed, a desk for working and a very nicely appointed bathroom with branded amenities. Executive rooms will grant you access to their Executive lounge which is a nice oasis to relax after a day of walking around the area. Typical hotel exec club amenities can be found here.Tokyo is a very big city so if you are going to be staying mostly in that part of town, I would not hesitate to book this property, you'll be happy you did.

From the window you could see the Shibuya crossing Starbucks but you’re so high up that you don’t get the noise. You could also see Mount Fuji! The service throughout the hotel was exemplary, from the check in staff to being shown around the room, and those working in the restaurant, bars and spa.I would suggest to the hotel that breakfast and spa access should be included, though I would also gratefully note that my room upgrade came with spa access. The swimming pool and jacuzzi is beautiful and very quiet.The breakfast room is very well featured and has incredibly attentive staff (a fantastic first experience of Japanese hospitality) though at 3000¥ per person/day you may wish to get your own elsewhere or go for an inclusive package.I can’t imagine staying anywhere else in Tokyo now - thank you Cerulean Tower Tokyu!","London, United Kingdom","764JohnS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

A nice person on the street took pity on us and helped us find the hotel. I recommend taking a cab to the hotel, even though it’s not far from the train station, because Shibuya Station is absolutely huge, and it’s no fun wandering around lost with luggage. We stayed in a room on an executive floor for access to the executive lounge for breakfast in the a.m. and a light dinner/hors d’oeuvres/drinks in the evening. The food in the executive lounge was good and the staff was polite. Our room was small but clean. The hotel pool is heated to a nice, warm temperature and the locker room was spotless.

After I presented the front desk manager with proof of what I had reserved, He then tried to tell me I would have to pay more for the suite, ( i had booked) Had he told me that he didn't have the suite available, perhaps I would of understood. Yet instead of giving in, or simply going by the rule, customer is always right. He was asking for additional money. After a 30 hour trip from Miami to Tokyo, we were tired and had enough. I took the rooms he said we paid for, even though again, my reservation said something else. All he would do was say sorry, but he didn't do anything else to accommodate us.

What's to like? First, the location, for us, is good. Only a few minutes walk to Shibuya station. Getting around Tokyo is easy, although the Shibuya station area is currently under construction and walking can be disorienting with pedestrian traffic re-routed here and there. Shibuya area is also quite crowded. Nonetheless, this is a good location. First stop from the airport for the airport bus limousine service. Airport transfers are therefore very convenient. Second, the hotel itself is modern, up-to-date, and quite clean. Our rooms were on the 36th and 33rd floors. Rather large for Tokyo standards. Nice walk-in shower and lots of good amenities in the bathroom. Bed was a super king size. Very comfortable. Big screen TV with two or three English language news channels. Third, we liked the breakfast room and its service. The room is bright and cheerful, full of morning light. There's a lot of buffet choices. Fresh squeezed orange juice is a favourite. Last and certainly not least is the friendly and efficient general staff service. Check-in was a breeze. Hotel stored a large suitcase for us while we journeyed to Nikko for a few days.

Easy to get to from Narita (I took the airport limousine for ~$30 USD and it brings you directly to the lobby - booked at the airport without an issue). Check in was a breeze. I was offered a complimentary upgrade to a king size bed (YAY) and had a lovely view of Tokyo. The room is clean and quiet; but nothing special. When I booked this hotel, I got a sale rate. For that rate, it was fine. Without the sale rate, it isn’t worth it. Several bathroom amenities but notably no lotion or shower cap. Just an FYI. Also no coffee maker in the room - I think it was instant? I don’t drink coffee often but I don’t think I’ve been in a hotel in Asia that hasn’t provided a nespresso machine or something similar. Especially at this price point.The bed is comfortable; actually softer than I expected. A couple of different types of pillows. The blackout shades work like a charm and are necessary for the very early sunrise. The hotel is about a 3-4 min walk to the Shibuya train station, which is one of its huge benefits. This station has a JR office, for those of you starting your rail pass or the like. Service has been wonderful so far, though I certainly haven’t required much. The gym is free from 6-7am; after which you must pay. It opens at 6am and is quite busy bc it’s free. If you want to workout in peace - go after 7am. The gym is compact with the basics. There is a small stability ball and some stretch mats. No yoga mats or foam rolls. There is a stretch area as well. Breakfast is also a separate cost, which I didn’t opt for. There are a 7-11 and a Family Mart right around the hotel.Laundry service is prompt and good - but fairly expensive. WiFi was excellent - no problem with FaceTime or streaming shows.Never had a problem with any smoke smells in the room. I know this can be a common issue in Asia. They have a lovely pastry shop in the lobby; unfortunately I wasn’t able to partake. But if you have a sweet tooth, you’re in luck!Wouldn’t hesitate to recommend but I’m not sure that I would stay again for this price.",,Danielle2374,115,4.0

It is a 5-10 minute walk to the station. Remember though that once you get in the station, you may have to walk another 10 minutes - its big. If you are trying to catch the NRT airport express, I would leave at least 20 minutes ahead of time. There are plenty of bars and restaurants within an 10 minute walk. The famous Shibuya crossing is 5-10 minutes away - you can get a nice view from Starbucks or the L'Occitane Cafe.Service: Amazing. The gentleman at the front desk, Mr. Ishioka, was most gracious and helped us resolve a room issue (we were initially assigned a double twin room but wanted one with queen/king bed ). The front desk manager, Mr. Takahiro Tsuruga, was also fantastic. They also gave us helpful recommendations. There are plenty of staff in the lobby to help with whatever is needed. We had not wait for checkin or checkout. Room: Luxury. Large bathroom with L'Occitane products to keep you smelling nice. The shower is large and roomy. The room itself is large with great views. Of course, they have a fancy toilet. Nespresso machine in room! They also provide several bottles of water. The only negative on the room is that there are few outlets;however, at lest one or two outlets will accommodate a US three prong plug which is nice. Unfortunately, they do not have any dedicated USB outlets. Sleep: Large,comfortable bed. No noise. You control the temperature. The black out curtains are very effective.Food/Drink: We went to the 40th floor bar which had great views of Tokyo. Drinks are little on the pricey side, but hey, it is Tokyo. Let me repeat, the view is fantastic. We did not dine at the hotel. There is a convenience store in the hotel.Value: The hotel is above average in cost per night, but I think the value is high. It is great hotel. I think i is well worth the extra $50-60 per night when compared to more 'average' hotels. We did not want to leave.Would I stay here again? Absolutely.

We struggled with staying in Shinjuku vs. Shibuya and feel we definitely made the right choice. In our view, Shibuya gives you the typical feel of Tokyo without some of the touristy or seediness you will find in certain parts of Shinjuku. The Cerulean offered comfortable rooms, a prime location just a 5 minute walk from Shibuya station (and the Shibuya crossing) and quick access to a multitude of great restaurants. We splurged and booked a room with Executive Floor access. Pricey, but worth it. Stunning views, afternoon tea and snacks, free cocktail hour and special check-in. An airport shuttle bus also stops at this hotel; for about $30 pp easy transport direct to the property after a long flight which was much appreciated.We would definitely stay at this hotel again.","Downers Grove, Illinois","Janet B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Downers Grove, Illinois</strong>",5,5.0

Location:I saw another guest comment about how the location is awkward within Shibuya and I don’t understand this at all. The location is absolutely perfect as it is only a few steps away from Shibuya station and the infamous Shibuya crossing. There are elevators on the long walkway crossing from the train to the hotel also, so it’s luggage friendly without having to worry about steps. There is easy access to everywhere you want to go in Tokyo as you can access the JR pass lines from the train as well as all the local trains. You are also walking distance from night entertainment in Shibuya, Roppongi, etc. without feeling like you are in the heat of the madness. Rooms:The rooms are massive for Japan and we had a great view of the city. Beds were super comfortable, top class toiletries and bathroom was luxurious. There was a cute little seating area with a table next to the window and it truly felt like we could relax in a luxurious room after coming back from a tiring day running around Tokyo. They also had a pocket WiFi (kind of like a hotspot) you could bring with you around the city for a small fee if you wanted. Facilities/grounds:The hotel itself is huge, but somehow manages to not feel crowded and it maintains a personalized feel. Between the abundance of restaurants, attentive staff members, high ceilings and multiple entrances, it never feels like you’re drowning in the mass, which I found to be unique. There is also a 7/11 on the 2nd floor which came in handy for local snacks and beverages when we would come home at night. Although we didn’t have time to use it, there is also a pool on premise (next time!). Service:Service level was top notch, especially considering that we speak zero Japanese. Check-in was a delight, complete with our bags brought up and a full tour of our room despite not staying in an executive suite. The concierge somehow pulled off a last minute dinner reservation for us for a same-day omakase reservation with 4 hours notice. Upon check-out, we were able to store our (many) bags up front for a few hours while we searched for our last bowl of ramen. Overall, this was one of my favorite hotels on our trip and I would fully recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the Shibuya area. It was an absolute delight for us and I’m looking forward to staying here again next time I’m in Tokyo. Highly recommended!

The staff was so friendly and helpful with all of our needs. The hotel is beautiful and our room was perfect - comfortable with a great view and all of the amenities we needed.

We chose the Cerulean based on prior positive experiences and because they offered a “Family Suite” on many major booking websites. The Family Suite consists of two connected regular King bed rooms, so you essentially get two normal hotel rooms for your family. Considering how expensive hotels can be in Tokyo, the Family Suite setup represented a really good value for a luxury hotel in a great location.The Cerulean is located inside a high-rise office tower. It is an easy 5-10 minute walk from Shibuya station and the famous Shibuya scramble crossing. The walk requires crossing a busy street and highway using a pedestrian overpass, so it could be challenging with a lot of luggage or if you aren’t good with stairs. The Airport Limousine stops at this hotel, so access from either Narita or Haneda airport is very easy. Even though the Cerulean is in the heart of Shibuya, it was a very quiet property and provides a nice respite from the noise outside.Our hotel room was great. It was spacious by Japanese standards, and the bathroom is simply fantastic. There’s a nice shower as well as a separate bathtub, both with great water pressure and nice hot temperatures. There’s also a huge spread of bath amenities. Because it’s a high rise, there are great views of Tokyo on a clear day, and the city lights are stunning at night. You get a sense for how immense Tokyo is. One nice touch is that a mobile phone is provided in the room. It’s nice to have a local telephone number to make dinner reservations and the like.We did not eat in any of the restaurants at the Cerulean because there are simply so many options steps away. We did however find the 7-11 convenience store in the building to be very useful to purchase a variety of food and snacks.We’d definitely stay at the Cerulean again.

We settled on the Cerulean in Shibuya because the reviews were really great and the price was very reasonable for a high end hotel in Tokyo with incredible skyline views which was very important to me (the Hyatt in Shinjuku was just too expensive for us to swallow and this seemed like a great second choice at a lower price point). The beds at the Cerulean were comfy which was really important for me because my back was very sore after the long-haul flight from Toronto. This is a true 4 star hotel with lots of nice little luxury touches, but it is not a '5 star' hotel by any means. We had a room on one of the upgraded floors, which was great and spotlessly clean. The view of the city from our room was awesome and we even had an incredible view of the city below us from the bathroom right over the bath which was very cool! The breakfast buffet was excellent and had something to suit all tastes, including 'classic' North American and European breakfast options. The only issue was that my husband and I felt nauseous while we were staying at this hotel, which, it is important to note, was for the first three nights of our trip. That being said, we were extremely jet lagged because we started our trip in Tokyo and it took us a while to adjust to the time change so we always felt kind of groggy and gross the first few days whenever we were in our hotel room. My husband thought that maybe we felt nauseous because our room in the hotel was really high up since the hotel is on the upper levels of a super high-rise building, and that we were feeling nauseous from feeling the towers sway very subtly in the wind. However, I really do think it was the jet lag that was the culprit.TIPS: DIRECTIONS FROM HANEDA AIRPORT TO THE HOTEL -Online it said it was approximately one hour to get to the hotel from the airport but we arrived during rush hour and it took us nearly two hours to get to the hotel by bus from Haneda Airport, so plan accordingly in terms of timing because it was a long bus ride for sure.Option 1 – Hotel Limousine Bus (approx. 60 minutes) Buy ticket from information desk - Keikyu Bus Touchscreen ticket machinesCost: 1030 yen per personTicket: Bus departure customers from Haneda Airport International Terminal should purchase ticket first from the Bus Ticketing Counter on the 2nd floor or the Bus Ticket Machine in the Ground floor. Bus stop shown in Orange is the bus stop for Airport Limousine Bus.Boarding: See map below (orange little bus is where to board from the international passenger terminal at Haneda Airport):Option 2 – Subway (approx. 60 minutes)Purchase a Suica card at the airport and load up Suica card, cost is about JPY 580 to get to the hotel.Directions:(1) Haneda Airport International Terminal / Haneda Airport Domestic Terminal Keikyu Airport Line (approximately 14 - 25 minutes )(2) Shinagawa Station JR Yamanote Line (approximately 12 minutes )(3) Shibuya Station on foot, 5 minutes.(4) Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel","Toronto, Canada","Bee E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",89,5.0

They have fresh squeeze orange juice, fruits, and an assortment of both American and Japanese standard breakfast items. The one thing I would say is overall in the amazing category is their pastries. Their croissants and other pastries are made at the hotel, and kudos to them, they are as good as ones in France (they have a bakery counter if you just want to buy a coffee and croissant, right at the restaurant entry). The best thing about this hotel is the location. It’s less than 5 minutes to walkto Shibuya Crossing and Metro station. Very well located if you are into walking and exploring.

The hotel was everything I could have hoped for: a convenient location, large beautifully decorated room (loved the toilet), endlessly fascinating view (34th floor) out over Tokyo, great staff. We were on the Club level and enjoyed meals, drinks and the view repeatedly throughout the day--it you can do this, it's more than worth it. There have been so many positive reviews of this hotel, so just a few additional thoughts. First, the location was excellent for a Tokyo novice. The Cerulean is quite central, near the Shibuya railroad and subway station and an interesting walk to many sights and shopping districts.Strange to say but the hotel's distinctive shape and height were also really helpful and made it easier to find in the mass of people, cars and multi-level/multi-dimensional movement at Shibuya street level.We loved the muted, cloth and wood decor. It was, well, soothing after a day out in Tokyo.Finally, the hotel staff were wonderful and helpful in so many ways.

I think the hotel should continue to communicate this based on other reviews. It is something us Westerners (incl. Asian Westerners) are not used to. The staff were very helpful and spoke good English.

The location being so close to Shibuya was fantastic. The rooms in the hotel are some of the nicest I've stayed in. We stayed in a Deluxe Queen room and it was well worth it. The bed was HUGE. It almost felt like 2 Queen size bed's pushed together. Had some of the best sleep I've ever had in this bed. Pillows were nice and soft as well.Bathroom was excellent. Toilet was just as I'd expect a Japan toilet would be (First time with warmed toilet seats!).Could not fault anything about the room (except maybe the size of the TV.... such a nice big room... yet the TV was small by comparison).The only negative was the cost of some things within the hotel itself. That was our fault though. For instance... the bar on the top floor was expensive. You can't go up there and not have a drink and some nibbles to go with the view, but the prices were exorbitant. The worst though was in the lobby. We sat down to have 2 coffees and were absolutely shocked at the price. Over 2,700 Yen (Almost $35 Australian) for 2 small cups of coffee is an absolute rip off. If we had seen a menu before walking in and being seated we would never have gone in, in the first place.

We were given a room on the 24th floor (rooms start from 19th floor) which had a decent enough view (city view of Skytree, Tokyo Tower etc) but I would have liked for us to have been higher given how people rave about the views from the higher floors. My husband went downstairs to see if they could change our room and after some persuading, they moved us to the 31st floor- this was good of them and I did appreciate this. We went to the Bellevisto bar on the first night and it was great and the drinks are very well made- views are outstanding too. The second night we went back and my husband asked if we could have some nuts with our drinks. Little did we know that on our bill we would be charged a ridiculous amount for these nuts (£6-7 GBP). Most bars give this complimentry yet they charged so much for so little. Really disappointed. On NYE after we had returned from the countdown at the Shibuya Crossing, we asked if we could have one drink at the bar but were told no- perhaps they were at capacity but they didn't seem to care much when turning us away. My husband woke up extra early on New Year's day to go upstairs to view the first sunset (it was promoted by the hotel as a guest only event) but he was initially told he couldn't enter even though he was the first person to arrive- it was all a bit odd and the man was not helpful to him.For the fact that we had spent five nights and quite a bit of money staying here, I just didn't feel that Japanese hospitality that I'd become used to elsewhere. The bathroom was ok but the toiletteries were not very good and I'm glad I'd still kept mine from previous hotels which I ended up using.The most helpful person was the sweet girl at the porter desk who helped me find out where they sell the amazing Panasonic hair dryers that are in the rooms. We stayed in the Capitol Tokyu Hotel in the first leg of our trip which is in the same group as the Cerulean Tower Tokyu and the service, rooms, toiletteries etc were far better at the former. Seems that the most positive reviews are from those who stayed in the executive suites/floors and received other great benefits from doing so.The hotel location itself is great as it's a 3 min walk to Shibuya Crossing and there's so much to see and do around there. Shibuya station is also a hop away.

We took the metro which is relatively easy to get around once you know where you need to make a change to get from point A to point B.Our hotel was located a few minutes from Shibuya station and we took the subway to get to the hotel. You are able to see the hotel from the station providing you use the correct exit.We followed the West exit sign to get to our hotel. The check in was relatively quick and first impressions the hotel was easy to get to and also very clean airy inside. We were taken to our room located on the 26th floor which had good views.Unfortunately, we were facing the road side rather than over the city. Although we had requested city view it but we let it slide as jet lagged kicked in and we decided to venture out for dinner quickly.There are so many restaurants located near the hotel and you are not short for choice. After dinner we decided to head back to the hotel and ask the hotel concierge to request a seat for the bar for New Year's Eve. We were informed by the staff that a reservation was not necessary and we could go up there on the day. With that information we went of on our way back to our room to rest. As we woke up around 2am due to jet lagged we had spotted a 7 Eleven attached to the hotel outside. We ventured there to grab some snacks. As we had metro cards(our version of the oyster) we could use this to purchase our goods. This can also be used in other shops too. Around 3am we went to the concierge to try and get a taxi to the fish market which has now relocated. Unfortunately, no taxi was waiting outside. The hotel informed us that they could call a taxi in but there would be a charge for them to call. I found this quite surprising as the lady we had helping us barely looked for a taxi and to then try charge us was a bit of a shock to say. We declined this as the call would have set us back £30. We walked to the main road and were easily able to find a cab. By the time it got to New Year's Eve we saw the sign on the hotel board that advised a reservation was required to go to the hotel bar. We went to the concierge to enquire as this is not what we were advised. Unfortunately, all of the seats had been reserved by this point and we could not get a reservation. I went back to the room while my partner decided to go to the hotel bar to explain the situation and see if they could do anything. Luckily for us a few cancellations happened and we were able to get seats by the bar with a good view (see picture 3).From this experience of the hotel unfortunately, we will not be going back or recommending it as the staff provided mixed information and also a lot of them were not able to communicate in English which made understanding difficult as they were unable to answer our queries.However it has not hindered our experience of Japan and I hope to go back to visit other places as the time there passed by really quickly.

We spent four nights in rooms on regular floors and, after a visit to Kyoto, one night on an executive floor. The rooms are spacious and well appointed - comfortable beds, good lighting, excellent bathrooms - and had wonderful views of Mt. Fuji. Executive rooms are on higher floors and have nicer amenities and furnishings. None of the rooms were cheap, but relative to other luxury properties in Tokyo, the Cerulean is a great value.This is a fairly large hotel, so you won't get highly personalized service, but the staff were very friendly and accommodating, and well organized. And before our arrival the concierge was helpful in booking a reservation at a Michelin-starred sushi ya in Ginza.The executive lounge is much quieter for breakfast than the bustling lobby restaurant, though both offered a nice selection of Japanese and western foods. Great way to start a jet-lagged day. The bar on 40 has spectacular views over the city and is not to be missed.

But I can definitely say that I will be staying at the Cerulean Tower again, and that's 100% down to location. For me it was perfect, and beat the better hotels I have stayed at in Tokyo. I was out and about 90% of the time, and being in the heart of Shibuya, a walk from Harajuku and Omotesando, made this hotel unbeatable for me. Also, a 3 or 4 minute walk to the easy-to-navigate JR Line which gets you everywhere is perfect. Plus, a 10 to 15 minute journey to Shinagawa for the Shinkasen is a further bonus for getting around Japan.Now, for my three gripes. You've paid extra for an Executive Level room. I think a 10.00am clearing away of breakfast is unacceptable. Why the rush ? There are people on vacation who want to relax, plus they are adjusting to a different time-zone and jetlag. Also, the food offerings at the Executive Level were so Westernised. I don't want Western food in Japan. Surely there could be a mix of Japanese and Western ? Lastly, I'd like to watch a bit of TV in bed before going to sleep. A huge percentage of the World speaks English. Why only CNN and BBC World News to watch ?Regardless of my gripes, I will definitely stay again..",London,"Serial_Traveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",441,4.0

It’s a quintessential Tokyo hotel with great views from the rooms and a central location, however the hotel is a little dated and the food is poor.Here’s what’s great...Location - this is a great asset of the hotel. You can walk to Shibuya and Harajuku so you’re never short of great restaurants, bars and shops.Design - although the hotel is quite old, there is something classically Japanese about it which is quite appealing. I ended up in an executive room which was far better than the standard rooms which are starting to look tired. Views from most rooms are spectacular. Service - service is overall good (with the exception of my check-in experience) and there are plenty of staff around to help out. Here’s what I didn’t like:Food - the food is consistently bad. Just some examples....1. ordered room service. 41$ for a burger, 11 fries (I counted) and soft drink. The burger was so undercooked I couldn’t eat it.2. I ate at the lobby restaurant and ordered pasta. The tomato sauce was almost pink and the bacon again totally undercooked.Reservation Mix-Up - when I arrived to my room they had given me a twin room although I was alone. The front desk told me they didn’t have any king rooms available and that I had booked a twin. I’ve never booked a twin before and my confirmation did not state bed type. The front desk did not manage the situation well as I was not willing to stay in a small single bed for my stay. The only offer was a paid upgrade which would cost me an additional 200$. Good customer service would have moved me free of charge - it’s not my fault the standard king rooms were sold out. This put a dark shadow on the rest of the stay.

All aspects of our stay were convenient and efficient. We caught the Airport Limo bus directly to the hotel, checked in with ease and spent 4 lovely nights here. We booked 2 adjoining rooms, which afforded luxurious space. We were blown away by the Handy phone in each room, which allows guests to access the internet and make international calls to certain countries for free. The phone allowed us to find our way around the busy Tokyo public transport system because of free internet access. Staff are professional and friendly and went out of their way to help us with any query. The hotel has set a really high standard, which I have no doubt we will find hard to beat. The icing on the cake is that it was affordable for the amenities and service provided. Location was so close to Shibuya Station for convenient access to the rest of Tokyo and beyond. We were not short of food choices with the many restaurants nearby. Shibuya Crossing is an experience on its own!

As other reviewers state, its a short walk to Shibuya station and local shopping. The area is vibrant particularly in the afternoon and evening. The hotel staff were extremely polite and friendly. Always eager to help if they could. I could not fault them at any point and the entire staff team should be commended for their exceptional service. We were very grateful.My only real disappointment here was when checking in, we were told that use of the pool was not included in the hotel rate. It was approx $25 AUD PER DAY more to use the pool. Given the high price we paid for the room only, this was a bit of an insult. As it turned out the pool would have been enjoyable at the end of each stinking hot and humid day exploring. What a disappointment. The top floor bar was under renovation when we stayed so we didn't get to try it. We did have a drink in the lobby bar one night. They had a violin/piano duo playing which was nice.We tried the hotel breakfast one day but it was very expensive (~AUD$40 p/p) and not worth it in comparison to other nearby options.The room was large with a big marble bathroom, and the bed was very comfortable. We couldn't see mount Fuji because it was so hazy but the view was nice. The tower is significantly larger than any nearby buildings.

Primarily, it has a great position. It's arguably the best in Shibuya and located very close to Omotesando Avenue and Minamiaoyama. It's therefore very close to a wide array of the coolest shopping and eating areas in Tokyo (which is definitely a big plus).Secondly, the service is good. You feel like you're well looked after. Thirdly, it's uniquely positioned as a relatively affordable 5 star hotel, though it is a far cry from others such as the Peninsula or Mandarin located in Ginza.However, this doesn't mean it's cheap. Unfortunately the state of the rooms let it down here too. They are certainly in need of an update. Food options are equally as ordinary. If it comes down to a question of whether it is good value for money, I would say only just. It really could be a lot better. In saying that, you'd be hard pressed to find a hotel in a better location, with facilities and service as good as the Cerulean's at the same price point.

Its gives a good balance between a spacious american sized room and amenities, and price. Room: i just get the basic room....2 twin beds...i love that the rooms start at a very high floor, so you get great views....ive seen both sides...and they are both great. The window is big unobstructed glass that frames either Mt. Fuji or the shibuya station on the other side. Theres even a space to sit on the ledge if you wanna do the lost in translation by the window shot. I like the fact that the shower is separate from the bathtub...although, there was 1 time i was here, and it was not...but most of them separate. They offer 2 bottles of water every day for free. They also have a loaner cell phone, although i didnt try it. My only negative is the sheets have a hint of cigarette smell. There are smoking rooms in the hotel....and i suspect they wash the sheets in the same batch as the smoking rooms, so you can notice it. Also, the mattress is not as comfortable as i remember it to be....maybe its time to replace with new ones?...or maybe im just getting old and my back is not as forgiving anymore....Hotel- ive been here about 4-5 times already over the years since 2003.....and the decor is still holding up, but it is showing its age. The penthouse bar is being remodeled so, hopefully it will breath new life to the place. I did not try the pool this time, but i remember you had to pay like $50 per day if you wanted to use it. It was a big nice pool...would have been great in the summer months.Service: This is what makes this place shine....everyone is very professional and efficient and very helpful. The concierge team is amazing! Naoko Tsugita and Yoko Sumida were so patient with all my requests and were on the ball when it came to getting me in all the restaurants i wanted to go to. They answered in 24hours and sometimes instantly if you were responding in the window when they worked. After hours, they have a senior manager who took care of us when we had last minute changes in plans. Absolutely worth staying here just for that. bell staff were very helpful as well and polite.Location: Big plus is the Limobus goes directly from narita to the hotel. its so convenient getting in and out of narita into your hotel. Cerulean is adjacent to the shibuya station....you just need go up the overpass to cross the street....if you have bad knees like me or if you have kids in a stroller...its a bit of a pain to go up and down stairs...although you can use the elevator on both ends.... it makes me think if only cerulean was on the same block or side as the shibuya station, it would have been perfect. Shibuya Excel is on the station itself and $40 cheaper but its not as nice as the cerulean. Theres tons of places to eat around the area....even behind the hotel, there are a ton of cool small restaurants you can choose from...or walk across the street to the bigger department store food court or the food show below the Tokyu department store.Overall...this is a great place and ill definitely stay again.","Los Angeles, California","neversummer1911</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",31,4.0

The breakfast buffet is excellent, extensive but expensive at 3326 yen for the ""full"" proposition. There is easy access to a choice restaurants on separate levels and also a Seven11 type convenience store on site. I am told the top floor bar is marvellous but unfortunately my schedule did not allow a visit. Now for the really strange and also irritating bit. They have a fitness suite with a great range of cardio and strength equipment. But you have to pay for access!????? In a hotel like this!? That is already expensive to say the least!!??? It's unheard of in my experience. In fairness this only matters to the minority of hotel guests that like to work our every day if possible. To everyone else.....who cares about the gym right!? Frankly, at this price, the gym should be free at all times to hotel guests. It must be mentioned that the gym is FREE to access between 06.00 and 07.00hrs, but outside that time, your paying.....and it is more than you might imagine!!! From memory, something like 2000 yen(!). My only other dislike was the furnishing in my non smoking room (2310).....really quite old fashioned and in need of a refurb. Also, the room and indeed the corridor to the room did smell of smoke, on what is stated as a non smoking floor. Yeah right!? This may be the case for the entire floor but I can only objectively comment on my room.So, in summary, a beautiful, but expensive hotel, that from what I could see, needs a decor update in some rooms and a strict smoking policy and needs to get a bit more of a 21st century policy on it's fitness club access. Good but pricey. ","Stockport, United Kingdom","BillL455</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockport, United Kingdom</strong>",21,3.0

Stayed here for 9 nights and booked 2 rooms. We wanted to book Four Seasons by Tokyo station but got attracted to the Shibuya district. They do have large rooms, American size, but the beds are smaller than Queen. The bathroom was also spacious with large sink counter and shower space. Large windows with great city views. The air conditioner was working great, a huge plus in a hot humid summer. In-room wi-fi has high speed and we had 4 devices running at the same time with no issues (game, movie, surfing).The best was their complementary smart phone (called handy phone) provided in the room (with its own charging station). You can take it out of the hotel for internet/map/calls, saved me over 10000 yen if I were to buy one of those sim cards for my phone at the airport. We walked (with young kids) to the Shibuya station everyday, easy commute to everywhere. Be warned, local Japanese do not know ""Cerulean"", as we got lost coming back late at night. Breakfast buffet was pricey (3500 yen) but that's average compare to its competitors (from my research), we didn't try it. There's a 7Eleven on the 2nd floor. We asked for COLD (us Americans) complementary bottled water daily after returning from a long day at the Porter desk, they were always happy to give it to us. You will feel like a King/Queen by the excellent service they provide. Despite limited English, each person will try his/her best to help you. We used their hotel limo minivan to move to another hotel by Disneyland, only 9000 yen for 6 people and lots of luggage. I asked the driver to take a side-trip and show us ""downtown"" Tokyo, no problem and no extra charge. We lost a bag behind, called the hotel and they delivered it to us the next day, only charged me 1000 yen for the gas. Btw, the hotel (Sheraton Grande) we stayed at by Disneyland did not have nice rooms compare to Cerulean.","Seattle, Washington","Archie A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",11,5.0

On the one hand, there are some great features. The first is that they provide you with a smart phone to take out and use (yes, it’s a bit of a brick but i found it extremely useful to avoid roaming costs.It’s fine if you just need it for Chrome and Maps). I’ve never heard of a hotel doing this, but wow; what a great touch. A second great point was the room itself - spacious, with good aircon, a big bath and shower, hairdryer, stunning view, comfy pillows, etc. To be fair, for the high cost of the hotel, it was on par with expectations. However the bed was a bit strange - they’d pushed two doubles together to make a bizarre, comically large, Optimus-prime-esque king size. We would have preferred a good old queen, especially if it meant more floor space and avoiding the awkward join seam in the middle.The third good point is the location. Just a short walk to Shibuya station, (and Shibuya itself is arguably the heart of modern Tokyo) but one block removed from the crazy noisy hub of the city, so it’s safe and quiet. Perfect. Now for the bad points. The first is that the gym and pool are not free for hotel guests. Well, the gym is free only if you go between 6 and 7am in the morning... and the pool doesn’t open till 7 so doesn’t even count in this deal. (Logic? Not so much). At all other times, using the hotel gym will cost you ¥2160 (which is almost $30 AUD). Have you ever heard of such a thing, in a 4.5 star hotel?! Charging guests to use the hotel pool and gym! Plus, they conveniently refrained from telling us this when we checked in, despite me asking details about the pool and where it was located (I mean hello - it was the perfect time to drop in a casual tidbit on the random cost right there?). So I turned up to work out at 7:30am and was asked how I’d like to pay, which came as a huge shock. Every other poor point has to do with charges - the buffet breakfast was a whopping ¥3300 (so we didn’t end up doing breakfast there). One night we went to the top floor hotel bar and they said it was a ¥1500 charge per person if we wanted to sit near a window. I mean, come on guys.Ultimately, this place was lovely to stay at, and very well located, (which is reflected in the price), but if you want to use the gym or pool, or eat breakfast there, be aware of the costs.","London, United Kingdom","carlaingrid</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",70,3.0

The room held not only the expected amenities (the nespresso machine adding a welcomed change to the usual sachets of instant coffee) but also the addition of a smart phone that, if I so wished, could be taken out of the hotel and used for the duration of my stay at no extra cost. I had asked to have a ticket forwarded to the hotel and the staff not only took it in before my arrival but then assured that I received upon my first visit to the hotel despite my arriving before check in time (they also, very kindly, took in my bags and then delivered them to my room in duration between this and my actual check in). In this interaction, as well as all others that I had with the staff, I found them not only polite but very willing to help with any issues that arose (not that I, myself, experienced any true issues during my stay) As one note if, like myself, you only have a debit card make sure you bring cash to pay for your room if you have not already done as such and be prepared to pay for any extra costs (mini bar, laundry etc) when they arise as a 'tab' can only be authorised with a credit card.

There is even a currency exchange machine in the lobby. We have stayed there many times. If you want to know everything wonderful about this hotel, there are hundreds of reviews on this site for you to read. So I will focus on the flaws which are not so obvious.1. Tokyo is a city to walk around and enjoy the convenience of the subway system and the JR trains. As such, visitors will want to take advantage of the very close Shibuya Station which has convenient connections to anywhere in Tokyo that you would want to go. But you must be very healthy and mobile to enjoy this convenience because to get from the Cerulean to Shibuya Station one must cross over a series of pedestrian bridges. Unless your heart, lungs and legs are in good shape, this could be a daunting task.2. The Cerulean will want to make an imprint of your credit card when you arrive with payment being made on departure. The problem with this scenario is that many brand new chip cards (like mine) are not embossed. As a result, we had to pay for our seven day stay up front. While this in itself may not be a major issue, it meant that I was billed in the current credit card billing cycle and not the next. This is called a cash flow problem. 3. The buffet breakfast should be avoided. It is expensive and, quite frankly, not very good.4. Back to that currency exchange machine. Yes, it is convenient if you want to exchange foreign currency bills to Japanese yen but the exchange rate is not as good as you would find at an ATM.","Thousand Oaks, CA","BCBob13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Thousand Oaks, CA</strong>",13,4.0

Pros of the hotel: easy, fast check-in, very impersonal but efficient. WiFi speed was great -- I was able to stream Netflix with no problems. Water pressure is INCREDIBLE -- hard to leave the shower! Our city-view was also quite nice. The decor was very basic, but clean and comfortable, especially the pillows. The location, close to the Shibuya train station was very convenient. All of the staff we spoke with had almost perfect English and were pleasant and efficient. CONS: This is a very institutional, not overly friendly hotel with no ambiance; which may not matter to you; we would have liked a hotel with a Japanese feel. We rarely saw staff as we were leaving or returning to the hotel because there are so many exits, most of which are not staffed. Added to the impersonal feel. We wanted interconnecting rooms, and so we could not get a room on the executive floor (there are no interconnecting rooms on the executive floors), as a result, we were not able to get the free breakfast in the executive lounge. The buffet on the main floor is roughly $35.00 per person -- not worth it to us to spend $140+ for breakfast. We brought bathing suits only to discover that the pool was for guests over age 18 -- crazy. Also, because we couldn't stay on the executive floor, we had to pay a large fee to use the fitness facilities -- annoying to be constantly asked for extra fees in a 5-star hotel, these amenities should be included. The smell in the hall was very smoky and musty, not pleasant to come home to but the rooms weren't smelly, the air quality isn't terrific though. We also were awoken many mornings by the sound of yapping dogs. I thought I was losing my mind until I discovered what appeared to be dogs being boarded on top of an adjacent low-rise building. They were very loud... I counted 14 or so dogs, all of them little yappy things that constantly barked while they were outside for their ""break"". Overall, if you are in Tokyo on business, this is probably a great hotel for you. If you are with your family, I would try somewhere else -- probably a different location like Shinjuku.","Toronto, Canada","LMGToronto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",91,3.0

The food and drink service here for breakfast and evening drinks is of very high quality. The food is constantly refreshed and monitored by staff, and although the selection won’t be the biggest you’ve seen, it really has everything you could want for a wonderful breakfast. Again, the smallish selection is more than made up for by the great quality of the food on offer. What really makes this hotel great is the service everywhere.

The location is perfect, just five minutes' walk from Shibuya station, from which direct trains connect tourists to almost anywhere they would want to go in Tokyo. The room was large (not just for Tokyo standards, but legitly large) and had a direct view of Mount Fuji. The small walk-in wardrobe was useful for storing parcels and such from our online purchases. Snacks and drinks can be had at the 7-Eleven downstairs -- not easy to find as it isn't on the street level, but up an escalator.We made good use of the direct limousine bus from/to Narita. When we checked out, we simply called the porter to pick up our bags from our room. She took care of everything and the next time we saw the bags again was at the airport -- very handy. Speaking of bags, if you have a Rimowa, the hotel is one of a handful in Tokyo that participates in the brand's complimentary repair programme. Rimowa will pick up, fix and return the suitcase for free. We took advantage of this to fix a wonky wheel that we never found the time to attend to back home. (Having said that, we had to speak to three different people before someone knew what we were talking about -- best to head downstairs to the front desk instead of talking to the operator.)The only reason why the hotel did not get five stars is this: two months before the trip, I emailed the concierge a list of restaurants to book for the trip. Someone wrote back to clarify something, then silence. I thought things would have been taken care of, but when I enquired one month prior to the trip, I found out that my request had vanished into a black hole. After some scrambling, we still weren't able to secure a couple of reservations at the desired date/time, which meant that we had to reshuffle our other commitments. No attempt at service recovery and the email I wrote to the manager went unanswered.

The room was large and comfortable with a separate walk in wardrobe area. The bathroom had a second window also and there was both a bath and shower. The hotel provided a free ""Handy"" phone which was great. I have never seen this in hotels before but we used it every day! The phone gave you internet access so it was brilliant to take out with you and use google maps to find your way about. Also was handy to look up restaurants in the area etc. We had breakfast in the Executive lounge - there was a good choice of hot and cold food available.

It is wonderfully located. I have been staying at the hotel for many years and every time, I cherish the moment I open the door to any of the rooms and find myself staring––through a window as large as the wall––at the most amazing and classic view of Tokyo.The hallways are a little worn out, but still clean and very quiet. The rooms and bathrooms are compact but feel very spacious because of how well designed and outfitted they are. Table, couch, minibar (a tad sparse), water kettle with teas, great l'Occitane toiletries, large TV, automatic blinds and curtains, and everything works. You can get shiatsu massage in the room.There is a fitness center with good equipment, a spa, and a sun-kissed, quiet (indoor) pool, made even more soothing by the fact that it is not over chlorinated. Please note, unless you have a special deal, you might have to pay extra for the fitness center.The restaurants are delicious, the service alert and solicitous.

This one fit the bill—it’s decently sized by Tokyo standards. There is a large window sill that I loved to sit in and take in the view while eating a snack, having a beer or morning coffee. We were fortunate to get a west facing view, which made for gorgeous sunsets and a stunning view of Mt Fuji on clear days. We never bothered with any of the hotel restaurants as the prices were high and so many inexpensive alternatives are nearby. There’s a 7/11 conbini around the corner where we bought coffee every morning for ¥150 each morning (along with loads of other goodies like breads, cookies, egg sandwiches, and mochi). We bought some beer there to take back to the hotel to drink in our room at much lower prices (and with less smoke) than the hotel bar. There’s also a quick service noodle shop next door that is open early in the morning and into the evenings, maybe 24 hours. For about ¥500, you can get a really satisfying and delicious bowl of soba or udon. I had Japanese curry there one morning for breakfast with a bowl of soba and that was tasty too. Lots of great izakaya very close as well. Bottom line, unless you’re dying for western style breakfast, you can spend a lot less than the hotel restaurant without going any farther away. The bathroom was lovely with abundant high end amenities like bath salts, special face care kit for ladies, green tea shampoo and more. Of course they provide all of the standard products like brushes and razors as well. The room did smell of smoke, despite being non smoking. There is an air purifier that helped somewhat, although we weren’t certain how to properly operate it as the controls were all in Japanese. The location of the hotel is so convenient to Shibuya station which is a nice place to stay as a home base from which to explore Tokyo. The hotel is a very tall tower, so it is easy to spot when leaving Shibuya station via the west exit. When you’re jet lagged and trying to orient yourself to navigate to your hotel, this is great. Shinkansen leave from nearby Shinagawa station, which is about 20-30 minutes away via the Yamanote line. Cerulean Tower is a reasonably priced, moderately luxurious hotel with a great location in Tokyo. I’d stay again on a future visit. ",,Suzanne S,10,4.0

The rooms were clean, comfortable, and were large for Tokyo standards. They also had a great view of Tokyo. No complaints there. The hotel is very centrally located in Shibuya, near all the major departmental stores and major train lines. Be aware you are in the heart of Tokyo, so there is hustle and bustle and plenty of people, so if you want something quieter and more relaxing this is not the place.The service was okay but could be warmer, its hard to describe but I guess there could be more smiling? I found the service to be very curt.We also unfortunately had a major fire in the car basement and had to evacuate down 21 flights of stairs, which royally messed up my nanny's knee. At first the announcement was only in Japanese and we had no clue whether to leave. The house maid was also misleading saying we should stay since it was only a car fire. Once I figured out it was a fire fire we high tailed it out of the building. The hotel needs to update its policies to inform its guests in all languages. Since 9/11 and earthquake disasters I don't take evacuation orders lightly. Also there were maybe only two staircases down the exit, I was glad things were orderly but there were times the evacuees were stuck in the stairwell and it was hard not to panic, especially since I was carrying my baby. So there may be a con to staying on the 40th floor if an emergency happens, at the very least be aware where the exits to this building are.

We figured we would be spending more time in the hotel and as such would benefit from a great view of the city. After we were checked in by a very formal and icy receptionist who took my card details for room incidentals. This had the unfortunate result of locking my card down for the rest of the stay, however my wife had her card so further purchases were made on that. When we got to our room, we were initially underwhelmed by our south west facing room. A guide was supplied with the room to suggest what the various epithets of the sky line were and what we should be able to see. Such as the rainbow bridge and Tokyo tower. We unfortunately were too far west facing for Tokyo tower and we would have needed a pair of binoculars or a telescope to see the rainbow bridge. On the plus side we did have a fantastic view of Mount Fuji on the rare days that the sky was completely clear so that was a pay off. Also on a positive note the room came with a complimentary ‘handyphone’ for use around Tokyo, giving us 4g internet access everywhere in the city and which allowed access to google maps and some social media. The family room we had been given was adequate but small though additional storage was located in a side room. The staff were for the most part courteous although there was an issue with some members of staff not speaking English to a competent level and accidentally giving incorrect information which was a pain, especially on the last day when we needed to get the limousine bus back to the airport and was told to wait in the wrong area to board the bus. Luckily we had allowed enough time to compensate for this oversight. The location was fine in a good spot approximately 5 to 10 mins walk from shibuya station.

This was my 3rd trip to Japan, and so far in every experience with restaurants, hotels, taxis, etc I've come to love the country and the friendliness of its people. This is why I've come back here to vacation every year for the last 3 years, as my wife and I have absolutely fallen in love with the culture and its people. Because of this background, this is why my stay at the Cerulean was so shocking and disappointing. Perhaps it was because everyone in our grouped tended to look young or that I had dressed quite casual during my stay there (cause I'm on vacation). But I had never been so rudely treated by a group of hotel staff as a group before in my life, especially at a ""5 star hotel"" which if that is true, shouldn't just be on the amenities and quality but also due to service.This wasn't just one isolated incident but many. For example, even when we checked in the person at the counter asked us rudely for our passports since I forgot that for international travelers it was required. It echoed the tone I felt throughout our stay there which was slightly condescending and dismissive. We actually stayed in the executive rooms which start on the 33rd or 34th floor so we had access to their special executive lounge where you can get breakfast as wells as snacks/drinks throughout the day. One time when we went up to the lounge for drinks the lady asked us for our room keys to verify we were executive guests in the same slightly condescending manner. Since we had very young kids with us, we wanted to go out and get some dinner and bring it to the lounge to eat at night when the kids were down. When I went to the counter to ask the same lady if that was ok, she reacted in slight horror and said that definitely was not allowed and if we got food we would have to eat it in their lobby. So that's what we did, we got some food and while we were eating in the lobby a hotel worker accosted us and demanded that we leave or go to our rooms to eat. We tried to explain that the whole reason we were eating in the lobby was our kids were sleeping in the hotel rooms and we couldn't eat in the executive lounge. He had literally waved his finger at us aggressvely like a parent disciplining a child and stated in an angry tone that they are a 5 star hotel and don't allow guests to eat in the lobby! I think he thought we had just come in off the street and was a little taken aback that we were actually executive guests because after that he literally scurried away like a rat after we had stated we were executive-level guests and he had no right to treat us that way. By this time we were furious because of the combination of events. The next morning, their front desk manager talked with us and we agreed that we would get a slight upgrade and a 25% discount on our stay. We shook hands and were happy with it and went out for the day. When we returned at 3 pm to move into our new rooms, he then informed us he could not give us the discount although we had agreed to it but he swore he did no such thing. Other hotel workers and my cousin all witnessed him agreeing to the 25% discount. This was incredibly upsetting because we were lied to in our face. Even worse, he claimed to have called Agoda (3rd party which booked tickets) and asked for them to discount us and they refused. When we talked to Agoda, they said they haven't talked to them and offered to give us a full refund on the rest of our stay so we could find other accomodations. I'm pretty sure that the manager never even tried to call and offered us the 25% discount knowing he would later revoke it and making it hard for us to find new accommodations. We ended up moving to the Westin, where we loved our stay.Finally, this hotel is great for business travelers but is NOT a kid-friendly place. We weren't allowed to bring our kids to breakfast, and they charge a ridiculous US $21 a DAY for the pool. We had brought swim wear assuming we could bring them to the pool or at least hang out there even if the kids didn't go in the wate.All in all, this was the most infuriating experiences I've ever had at a hotel. A true 5 star hotel shouldn't feel like it needs to constantly tell its guests they are a 5 star hotel and make the guests feel like prisoners with all their rules. We weren't trying to do anything out of bounds except for eating together and having fun with our kids. I'll never stay again at the Cerulean and will be telling all my friends and colleagues in the future to avoid the hotel at all costs.","Sunnyvale, California","soeske18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunnyvale, California</strong>",19,1.0

The hotel itself is beautiful. It's in a great/central location. Certain staff members were friendly and had some nice perks if you're staying in one of the executive floors, like daily breakfast or happy hour in the private lounge with view. I think I would have mostly enjoyed this if I was there by myself, but I was not alone, I came with my wife and 11 month old and family that also had an infant baby. This hotel should just be upfront and call itself an adult only hotel. It's not on the 3rd party travel sites that you cannot bring children to breakfast. We didn't even realize the gym & pool had a daily charge per person. Then we find out not only there was a charge, but pool is adults only as well. These things just kept adding up, that it felt like its this nice hotel, but we couldn't even use what we were paying a premium on. After being frustrated with all these things piling up, we finally hit our breaking point with the service, or lack thereof. Both us and the family we traveled with had our babies down for bed in our rooms. We went up to have a drink in the executive lounge and asked if we could bring in food since they didn't serve food there. They were appalled we even asked and told us we couldn't do it, but could in the lobby. We went and picked up some food next door and ate in the lobby like they said we could, to then get verbally abused by the lobby workers for eating in their hotel lobby. First, it seemed like they profiled us, thinking we were just rift raft in their 5 star hotel, seeing us being young and in shorts and t-shirts. They pointed their fingers at us and screamed and made us feel like we were scum. We finally let them have it and demanded a refund to let us check out. They seemed embarrassed once they realized we were staying in their premium rooms. Their manager took us out of the lobby to try and keep us from causing a scene and acted like they would take care of us. We spoke to a higher level manager the next day and initially they just offered breakfast passes to another restaurant on lower floor. We still wanted to not bother and just get a refund. They claimed they couldn't because we booked through 3rd party, Agoda. They did act like they wanted to try and make things right though, and after a lot of back and forth, they promised us an executive suite along with a discount in rate. We left for the day, agreed we wouldn't check out, to come back and find that they didn't give us the suite, they just moved us to a corner room that was older and then said they wouldn't honor the discount. They just flat out lied to us and we just wasted a day working with them, dealing with stress of this whole situation, to then have them pull back on what they promised us. They also said they wouldn't refund us if we wanted to leave, so I went and complained to Agoda that we just received the worst customer experience we had ever faced, and Agoda went ahead and refunded us, no problems at all. We still gave the hotel another chance to try and make it right, now that their excuse of not being able to do anything due to being through a 3rd party booking no longer applies, but they still wouldn't honor it. On top of all of this, the manager was downright disrespectful to me. He only agreed to speak to my family member for some reason, and I was the person that booked the rooms for our family while I was there for work. When I tried to speak to him, he flat out ignored what I had to say and even turned his back on me. It was downright the most disrespectful treatment I'd ever experienced. They liked to claim they were a 5 star hotel, but a big reason for getting a 5 star rating is service, and their service was the worst I could have ever imagined. It was such an anomaly as we have found service in Japan to be wonderful. Since it was late in the day, we checked out the next morning and went over to the Westin, which was absolutely wonderful and they catered to families and treated us with true 5 star service from a 5 star hotel. It truly was a shame, as I'll be back for work and my company's Japan office was a short walk from the hotel, but I definitely will never stay here again and would highly urge anyone else with families to avoid as well.","San Francisco, California, United States","SeanW936</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California, United States</strong>",23,1.0

It also helped that they are an Accor partner hotel so I could earn some decent points for my 6D5N stay. PRICE - really expensive and the only reason I could only stay here was because 3 nights out of 5 were borne as business. My total stay was JPY 196,736 (est SGD2,380) and I opted to upgrade to the Tower Floor for another total of JPY36,828 (est SGD450) as the cost would have been almost the same if I add 2x breakfast to the base rate. So my total was about SGD600 per night! That upgrade gave me breakfast and access to the Executive Salon but still, this is one of the most expensive non-suite rooms I have ever stayed in. Note that the rates are a little lower if you book through their website proper instead of the Accor website. LOCATION - right smack in Shibuya and the towering height makes it too hard to miss, plus a good navigating point if you get lost in the area. 5mins-10mins walk from Shibuya station and a quick walk brings you to the middle of the action. GETTING HERE - Super easy after a little research. After getting out of the arrival hall, grab your airport limousine bus tickets from the counter, go to the correct bus stop number (they will check your ticket again), and get on while they load your luggage. Get down when they announce Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel. Must easier than attempting the train! CHECK IN - was super happy the room was already available at 11am+ and process was courteous and seamless. I had also ordered a box of items to be collected upon my arrival and was impressed that the hotel even allows such transactions for the brand (payment was made to hotel upon checkout)ROOM - I got 3302 (twin beds) and the the size was adequate for 2 ladies with big luggage. Cleanliness was top notch, and so as the toiletries offered in the bathroom. L'occitane toiletries was def a bonus! Super comfy beds but the a/c takes a while to get the room comfortable enough. EXECUTIVE SALON - I had access to the Executive Lounge and most times it was never crowded, even at breakfast. Service was always polite and attentive. But the cocktail hours had a poor showing in terms of the quality and quantity offered - pre-packed cheeses and dried fruits, nuts, and cookies but no other cold and hot items. I understand that its not supposed to be dinner food but with the other properties offering much more, its always good to stay competitive. Coffee was good though. Bonus points for champagne available during cocktail hours. I also had a bad breakfast experience one morning but I've corresponded with the management directly so not going to repeat here - essentially about flexibility and offering options to guests. FACILITIES - I paid JPY1,080 (SGD15) to check out their indoor pool, really nice with a adjourning jacuzzi. But I found it really strange to have to pay to use the facilities with a $600 per night room.CHECK OUT - Swift and painless. SERVICE - not too bad except for my crappy breakfast experience. This will be my first choice if I come to Shibuya again but the prices makes it really hard for it to be an easy choice.","Singapore, Singapore","Hburn10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",177,4.0

(Shinjuku is also really convenient but felt way more crowded - like Times Sq before the pedestrian areas) (7-Eleven downstairs in the building)Rooms are modern and clean. Unfortunately, my husband and two kids had to split into two rooms because two double bed configurations don't exist but they did give us two joining rooms which was nice but not very economical for us. The hotel itself does not have a lot of personality - felt like a nice business hotel that could be anywhere in the world. So here's the most interesting part of our stay - we were there during a 6.9 magnitude earthquake. Being from CA, I am not particularly afraid of earthquakes but being in a high rise during one is a whole new experience. I think the buildings are meant to move with the quake so an already long earthquake was made extra lengthy. I woke up at 5 am and it felt like I was on a Caribbean booze cruise. The rolling went on so long that I scanned the room for potential falling items (absolutely nothing), checked on my kids in the next room(still asleep) and looked out the window (locals walking to work totally chill) and we were still rolling. When I opened the door, we found crazed Americans running around heading for the stairs so we decided better safe than sorry although by then the movement had stopped. After grabbing our kids and trudging down 31 flights, the hotel staff kindly told us we were safe and could head back to our room in the elevator or hang out in the lobby if we felt more comfortable - with a gentle reminder that they do have alarms if we actually needed to evacuate. I noticed we lost my daughters sneaker at some point and asked a staff member to keep an eye out for it. We quickly went back to our room and back to bed. Five hours later we get a call that the staff had searched the lobby and all the stairwells for the missing sneaker with apologies that they could not locate it anywhere but they would continue to search and wanted to know our exact path downstairs. A quick search in our room revealed it was behind our door. Oops. (Don't worry, we quickly called back to call off the search) Tldr- that building is earthquake safe and service is almost too good!

Access to the airport is also very convenient - can either take the airport bus or the JR line (JR Shibuya station is just a 5 mins walk from the hotel).The rooms and bathroom were clean and nice, and by Asian standards, also very spacious, so it was a very comfortable stay.

We had already stayed in other hotels in Tokyo and this one was by far the most expensive and so we had prepared ourselves for a bit of luxury however it hardly met that expectation and the front desk staff did not provide the warm welcome weary travelers were looking for - it did seem the hotel catered mostly to business guests so perhaps the service style wasn't quite what we were accustomed to. Without going into the ins and outs of our check-in woes, we were informed that we had been upgraded rooms as they had oversold the standard room we had booked and we would be given a key card to access our floor from the elevator - it was highlighted to us we could not use any amenity afforded to those who had booked the more expensive rooms and that it was an upgrade in room only which was fine for us, we would have been happy with the room we booked.Anyway, our 'upgraded' room did not seem to have anything extra over and above a standard room and the only positive I can give is that it was large for Tokyo hotel room standards however still small and not exactly spacious. Cleanliness was okay and comfort was so-so, however having stayed in comparable hotels in other areas of Japan (such as Osaka) this hotel was severely lacking. I understand Osaka and Tokyo are completely different cities, however the idea of a luxury hotel in Tokyo is completely different from Osaka and this hotel did feel rather basic, but with a large price tag and they had completely neglected the small details that make an expensive stay at a premium hotel worthwhile. The restaurants and bars located inside the hotel were absolutely extortionate and room service prices were actually pretty comical which placed dining or drinking inside the hotel way out of our budget - had there been at least one affordable option we may have dined in. The location is pretty good in terms of transport, shopping and dining, however I did much prefer staying in the Shinjuku area - but that is just personal preference, there was more that appealed to us in Shinjuku than Shibuya. Overall, I personally think the hotel is overpriced for what they deliver and that there are more affordable hotels in the area that offer the same standard as the Cerulean Tower does and the customer service is hardly a redeeming feature of the hotel - we experienced far better in other hotels in Tokyo, many much cheaper than the stay we booked here.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","PaulJ19</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",54,3.0

Just make sure you ask for a room from which you can see Tokyu Toyoko department store, right next to Shibuya Station.The hotel has many perks for the business traveller coming to Tokyo for the first time: - great connection: close to Shibuya train station for getting around easily; direct airport limousine bus connection (only 1030 JPY each way, but you won't get a receipt when taking it from the hotel to Haneda)- close to several icons so you can squeeze in some sightseeing: the rooftop Adidas futsal field, Hachiko, Shibuya scramble crossing (go to the overhead bridge linking Shibuya MarkCity to the station for a great perch to take video/photos of the crossing)- next to lively Shibuya with its many restaurants and shops- easy access to foodhalls in Shibuya MarkCity and Tokyu department store where you can stock up on Japanese pastries, dessert and snacks as gifts for the office or just to bring home to family Japanese service standards are phenomenal, so expect that at Cerulean too. I asked for recommendations to ramen and local cuisine near the hotel. The staff came back later with 2 marked maps showing the location of recommended restaurants and even the price range.The rooms are also rather large (by Japanese standards), and yes, you do have to pay for the fitness facilities (I got a free voucher but it was wasted on me).",Australia,"Charlestkh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",22,4.0

They have done a great job of maintaining this property which is in the heart of Shibuya within a 3 minute walk to the train station. The rooms were very nice with great views of the city (get the bathroom with the window over the tub) and the service is always wonderful. If you're a frequent Tokyo visitor, you know how nice it is to have a 7-11 tucked on the second floor of the building for easy ATM's, snacks, and whiskey highballs in a can. We had drinks a couple of times at the Italian restaurant on the second floor--go see Sunny at the bar, he's awesome.As for location, I just don't think you can do much better in Tokyo than the Cerulean. Shibuya is fun to walk around, and it's also a super easy walk to Harajuku, Aoyoma, and Naka Meguro. The train station is big enough that you can get everywhere easily, including catching the NEX to the airport and the Shinkansen to Kyoto, etc. I've looked at pricier hotels that look super swank, but they just aren't located all that great, and the Cerulean feels way nicer than its price. One last thing--I contacted the concierge a few months out about restaurant reservations, and they got us in to Sukiyabashi Jiro in Ginza. That was a major thumbs up, and I highly recommend their concierge service for your tough to get in restaurant needs.","Houston, Texas","revcaf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",23,5.0

I had heard that the Cerulean hotel in Shibuya is a good bet. Not in the middle of the frenetic footfall but close enough to be near the cool factor. The hotel is certainly well located and the price point is value for money. We took a large corner room that was huge and great for lounging. It was the little things that let us down. The stuffy bedrooms even after maintenance checked it twice. The lack of turn down service. The fact that the massage service could only be booked from 4pm and you could only contact them from 4pm. The knowledgeable but unwelcoming concierge service. The weak hairdryer. It was like they got the architecture right but the experience of hotel guests was an overthought. Which is fine in a business hotel where harried guests just want a wake up call and an early breakfast. By any other standards, it was a good stay. But this is my 8th trip to Japan, where the level of courtesy (from bellboys to random strangers helping you find your way on the street) and hotel service makes every other guest relations officer look like a warden keeping discipline in a super max prison.

Very easy access to the station and the shops of Shibuya. We had a standard room on the 26th floor, and because Tokyo is so vast, I suspect the views are equally incredible regardless of which side of the building they're on.The hotel is what one would expect of a business hotel in a city - nothing special, although having seen a number of 4* hotels with extremely small bathrooms and rooms in Tokyo I was a bit worried, but this was not a problem here. As it's pretty standard though, I just wanted to share a few 'be aware' notes:- We booked on Hotels.com which is usually really good at small print, but the hotel had not told them (I guess) that there was an additional charge - I think about Y2000 ppn - to use the pool and gym. I was extremely angry because it was one of the reasons we booked that hotel, and they were not even slightly apologetic. However, on pushing a bit, we were told that signing up to a Japanese hotel loyalty scheme they would give us free access for the duration of our stay - well worth doing!- The bar on the top floor - like many upmarket hotel bars in Tokyo, we later discovered - charged a cost just to be seated, even for guests. This was fairly pricey, so just be aware if you want to go and take in the view of the crossing (which is pretty cool, but not worth the price of two extra cocktails when you can just walk up there and take a look!). They also didn't do nibbles with drinks, which seemed unnecessarily stingy!- The restaurants attached to the hotel are - unsurprisingly - really expensive, but the one we went to (the Italian) was not worth it at all. We only went there because it was late and we needed to eat, but in hindsight should have just crossed the street!- The hotel pool does not allow access to people with tattoos! We'd heard about this for the onsen (although saw no signs or evidence of a ban), and were very surprised that it was the case for a business hotel in the city, but there you go - consider yourselves warned!","London, United Kingdom","JRB2207</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",44,3.0

The bathroom was spacious, but could have done with a bit more space for placing your personal toiletries. I enjoyed the large bath. The one thing that really let it down was a pervading smell of cigarette smoke in our non-smoking room. I couldn't tell if the precious occupant had been smoking or if it had been circulating from smoking rooms via the air conditioning. As a non-smoker and an asthmatic it was quite noticeable.

We spent a lot of time in Shibuya and this was conveniently located in that neighborhood. (Also walkable to Shimokitazawa, Naka-megura, and Daikanyama, where we spent a good deal of time). The room was a good size and clean. The staff was very helpful and helped coordinate a plan to send our luggage to our next hotel while we traveled to Kyoto. After busy days of sightseeing it was so nice to return to a neighborhood we loved. We could casually wander Shibuya for an hour or so without it becoming a stressful thing. We also really enjoyed getting drinks at the bar at night. Great view. It was a five minute walk to Shibuya Station which was such a hub. So many lines ran through there. Later in the trip we stayed at the Park Hyatt and though that is a beautiful hotel, there wasn't much to do in the neighborhood and the nearest subway station wasn't that conducive to easy travel around town. We had to transfer a lot and it was confusing. We missed the Cerulean Tower!","Los Angeles, California","elizbethando</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",3,5.0

The shower facility was outstanding was helpful prior to our long flight. Ps: Make sure to use the massage chairs - they are awesome. We thought it was a nice touch for them to allow us to use the showers and not charge us - it was greatly appreciated.

First for 4 nights and then again our last night in Tokyo in a different type of room (notes on both below). Overall the hotel is really nice, but definitely a business hotel. It's located very close to Shibuya Crossing and the train station--you become very intimately acquainted with the overpass bridge to go back and forth from the hotel to the train. The location is key as many trains stop here and you can get almost anywhere with this as a starting point. The concierge was not as helpful as would have liked though. I expected quick recommendations but they looked things up online and one time suggest a restaurant in a mall food court (for the record there's nothing wrong with food court restaurants but this one was not very good and it was my husbands birthday).Our first room, room 3318 on the 33rd floor. Great room--small and very clean. There is a large window that you can look out while laying on the bed and we had a view of Mt Fuji (when it wasn't hazy). Comfy bed, hard pillows (one of which has weird pearl type things in it, I didn't like it when sleeping on my side). Medium sized bathroom, nice L'Occitane amenities, no counter space. You have to use your room key to access this floor (which makes you feel special) and you get free breakfast in the morning which was insanely helpful every day. Breakfast is good, not great. LOVE the coffee/latte machine! Free internet was ok, worked but couldn't stream anything (that's probably the point).Our second room, 2208 (I think that was the number). Very clean much bigger than the other room. It had the biggest bed I've ever seen in my entire life! The bed was very comfy with ok pillows (same as other room). The bathroom was quite large, tons of counter space and a separate ""room"" with the shower tub. This shower did not have an ""American"" shower where the shower head is over the tub with a shower curtain. We stood in the tub while holding the shower head over us. Amenities are good but not L'Occitane. The thing that killed me in this room was that if you need an iron, you have to rent it from the hotel. The other room had an iron in it. No special room key access for this floor, makes you feel like a plebian when you're in the elevator with someone who has special floor access. Had a view of Tokyo Tower which was great! No breakfast with this room but that was fine because we were going to the fish market for breakfast. Free internet was ok, worked but couldn't stream anything (that's probably the point).Overall, I would stay here again in Japan and recommend it to others.","San Francisco, California","Amanda M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",10,5.0

The place is bustling and efficient as well as near various shopping areas. Had ordered from Amazon Japan and the box was promptly handed to me as I checked in. The luggage service was prompt and pleasant. We had opted to splurge on a room with access to the 33rd floor executive lounge instead of doing the group rate. The room we had turned out to be smaller than one of the rooms for the group and more expensive but bed and pillows were super comfortable.. The executive lounge is a treat though with great views including Mt. Fuji on a clear day. The people in the lounge couldn't have been more helpful. Breakfast there was lovely. Afternoon tea was meager as far as food but great if you happened to be a big drinker as booze is free of course.My one complaint: when we checked in they advised they were totally sold out and although the room was quite small and there were stains on the carpet, we were too tired to say anything. I expected that the stains would be taken care of by the next day but nothing was done. As we were there for business, we were seldom in the room and only thought to mention it as we checked out.

The hotel seems to have a swarm of people to serve you as soon as you arrive, and the staff are genuinely friendly and helpful. We stayed in a twin room on the 20th floor, and had a huge corner room which was very light and bright.Our only concern was the strange noise which periodically came from the bathroom throughout our stay. We couldn't work out whether this was someone flushing a toilet or emptying a bath on another floor, but it was certainly a loud noise. We didn't worry too much about this though.The breakfast buffet was reasonably expensive ( around A$40 pp ), but quite good, with freshly squeezed orange juice, good pastries, and all the usual breakfast options. If I was deciding on future bookings whether or not to pay a breakfast inclusive rate, I'd probably opt for no breakfast, as it was nice to do for a couple of days, but after that I think I'd just head to Starbucks where you can get a reasonable coffee, fruit, yoghurt with granola and a juice for around $15-$20 pp.All in all, this is a really nice hotel with a great location, but if the price keeps escalating, I'd go to the Shibuya Excel which is considerably cheaper.","Melbourne, Australia","Bali-dreaming</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",88,5.0

We had prebooked the Airport Limousine Bus which goes directly from Haneda Airport to this hotel but as our flight was late and we ended up arriving after midnight so we could not use our prebooked ticket.

Hotel location and accommodations had great reviews. Nightly rate was a little higher than other hotels in the vicinity. However, when planning a family trip, didn't want to save few dollars and be miserable for the duration of the trip. We have booked two queens with the two minors for the room (2 nights). Upon checking-in front desk lady said you need to book an extra room because you have only indicated two adults on reservation. So she reserved an additional room on a totally separate level at additional $500/per night. At this moment, my comment was we are here on a family vacation. You are expecting us to be in two different rooms? How about upgrading to a suite so we can be together? Front desk lady's comment was ""we are sold out with suites."" She showed no effort to accommodate and when I asked her to cancel the EXTRA room, she threw the credit card back at us. I told her, I would rather find another hotel in the vicinity for the two members of our family than book an additional room here at this hotel. When traveling to a foreign country, I understand there might be a language barrier. However, body language and face expressions are Universal. She was definitely rude.

It is not cheap but for the location and service we had from everyone at the hotel, we have no complaints. Couple suggestions. Order your sim card with unlimited internet access before arrival to Japan. Pick up at post office in airport. Works with iPhone, not sure about Android. Make sure you have Whatsapp on every phone of your family before arrival. Your itunes account will not be accessible. Google maps is a must to get around.Know your location in relation to other places you plan to visit before arrival to Japan.

For us the Cerulean Towers ticked the boxes- but not without a bit of re-work after we arrived. Once we got sorted we had an excellent stay. I would easily stay here again. We are a family of 3. That is, we travel with a teenager. If you have one you understand. These fascinating creatures have different needs and requirements than others in our species. A new adventure can be life-changing. Afterward you might be amazed to hear them tell friends and family how awesome the trip was because during the experience they seemed to prefer to be anywhere else much of the time. Gotta love 'em. We love dragging our teen around the world, but we also love that they are old enough to entertain themselves at times. That said, sharing a hotel room has reached it's term limit. Beds in Tokyo hotel rooms, it turns out, use ""double"" and ""single"" differently. And getting a room for 3 is a non-starter. If you are a couple you will have 2 beds (a double). A single is one bed, small or large. We arrived to our room after exchanging emails asking to have our room prepared for 3 only to discover a chaotic nightmare of beds/tables/chairs crammed together to suit our request. Sharing a room with a teen for a week is daunting enough. This was going to break even the most unified of families. Luckily, Cerulean Towers rose to the occasion. We sifted our reservation to two rooms, a single room and double, which ended up costing only slightly more than the ""triple"". The extra cost made the trip a pleasure for everyone that combined family time with a getaway.  During the day we adventured everywhere by foot and train. The station is not nearly as daunting as I feared. Most things are written in English somewhere. Just leave yourself plenty of time to find your way and figure out the ticket-buying machine. For dinner nearby the hotel there is a hill just behind it that is filled with fantastic tiny Izakaya places, as well as all kinds of other places including Indian and even an American-style diner. We ate at local Japanese places and the food was fabulous and super local.  In-room amenities were excellent which makes packing light. For me that alone almost earns a hotel 5 stars. Razor, toothbrush, toothpaste, as well as the usual shampoo, etc. are all provided and good quality. I was thrilled. But just in case you forgot something, there is a large 7-11 in the hotel and the concierge is fantastic. I had them purchase tickets for me to a museum I wanted to attend (that only sold tix in Japan) and they had them waiting on check-in.  Do stop in the upstairs bar, Bello Visto. The bartender, Park (?) is working on his Aviation which happens to be one of my favorite classic cocktails. They have a good selection of Japanese whiskey and a view that has to be one of the best anywhere in the world.","Boulder, Colorado","Naomi B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boulder, Colorado</strong>",110,5.0

Check in (2/5): I flew in from a Bombay red eye flight with a total 14 hour door to door commute and expected to just crash in the room. I was told by every single colleague who has taken the same flight and stayed at cerulean that they ""do not"" give an early check in. Just as expected, I was told to come back to the hotel at 2pm as the room isn't ready yet (I was there at 9am). Check out (5/5): Checkout at 6am was a smooth process and took under 5 minutes. The porter desk also helped arrange tickets for the morning bus back to Narita.Overall, I was super happy with the stay and would definitely want to visit and stay here again. I just wish they allow early check-in and improve their wifi speeds. ","Munich, Germany","iVizz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Munich, Germany</strong>",107,4.0

Excellent location with Tokyo hot spots right near the hotel.  We initially where booked into a king room on a tower floor. These rooms included the executive lounge access. The regular king rooms are small, with small bathroom including glass enclosed shower tub combo. The King Corner room is the best bet, 3 different picture windows including a bathtub window view. The room size is comfortable including couch seating area, desk area, and bathroom with dbl sink, soaking tub, and separate glass enclosed shower.   The hotel website was a bit confusing as there are numerous different types of rooms. I'd suggest the hotel streamline the room categories if they could. We were initially booked into a regular king room and switched to a corner king after one night. The ease at which we were able to switch rooms made me think this might happen with some frequency.   The executive lounge located on the 35th floor was intimate yet well appointed. Holding approx 35-40 people, the lounge never felt crowded. The wall of picture windows lets you enjoy breakfast with Mt. Fuji in view on a clear day. The breakfast was a combination Japanese, American, European. Something for most everyone. I suggest getting to breakfast early as you'll want to linger in the picture window seating and soak up the vibe.  All around solid chose of home base to tour Toyko.

The rooms are very quiet, with Tempur-pedic beds, great pillows, and curtains that shut out 100% of the lights, so that you get a really deep sleep after your exhausting days in Tokyo! We ate breakfast almost every morning at Denny's, which is about a 5 minute walk through an interesting neighborhood. You have to go to the Nanpeidai Denny's (not the Shibuya Denny's), which Google Maps will guide you to. Don't use Google Maps inside of the ""scramble area"" of Shibuya because the tall buildings will block the signal. But when going to the Nanpeidai Denny's, which is in the direction away from the ""scramble,"", there was no problem following the Google Maps directions. So, about Denny's: we found that they serve a really nice American breakfast set for only 549 yen, including great coffee. That's quite a bit less than the 3,000 yen breakfast at the hotel! We also found out that Denny's is considered at the top quality of breakfast places in Japan. If you're short on time, you can pick up breakfast the 7-11 and have them heat it up for you when you buy it. The other tidbit is to utilize their concierge service as much as possible. Aside from one concierge lady who never smiled and and who gave the most minimalist answer to any question you asked her, the people were very helpful to give advice about anything from which trains to take to where to purchase certain things. If the lady is sitting there, just ask the porters- they were very helpful too. Every hotel in Tokyo charges for swimming/exercise facilities. I think that in Tokyo it is not considered a normal activity. I know that when we stayed in Odawara and Takeyama it was included, however.

The building itself houses the hotel along with offices and restaurants, but the rooms are mostly on upper floors and the views are spectacular. The hotel description does say that there is a pool, and there is one in the building, but it is not part of the hotel and is not free. The fitness facility is a separate business and is open to hotel guests from 6am to 7am free of charge, but that does not include the pool.

I'm sure the one is wonderful, but we never experienced it as they wanted an extra ¥2,500 per person. We were already paying ¥270,000 for 3 nights (2 rooms) so we didn't bother. I think this policy is dreadful in a modern international hotel. I'm not even sure if the cost was per stay or per dip!As a less significant second gripe, I needed 5 small gifts wrapping for some business colleagues. Having little time I asked the concierge to do it for me. It took two attempts and even included a few attempts at Japanese, but both people made me feel like it was a lot to ask. I must say that they came back looking really nice once they had agreed and only charged ¥550, so not all bad, but I have come to expect better service in Japan.

It costs a little bit more, but generally in Japan, you get what you pay for. I've been to Japan four times and tried countless hotels, and this is the place I always choose to stay. Please trust me and splurge a little for this hotel, as it will make your Tokyo trip that much better.First of all, the location is absolutely ideal. It is minutes away from Shibuya station, which will easily get you anywhere in Tokyo. However, it is also on the edge of Shibuya, so away from the craziness for when you want to relax peacefully. On the other hand, if you're feeling restless, you can cross a bridge and be in the middle of it all. I highly recommend checking out Shibuya late night, as it turns into something different with merry, drunk youngsters barely able to walk.Room is large by Japanese standards. Bathroom is exquisite with granite showers. Bed is absolutely huge and comfortable. Air conditioning/heating works well. You also get spectacular views of the city from your window.Hotel staff is polite and also warm and friendly. Everything from check-in and baggage handling was great. There is also a 7-11 on the second floor for everything else the hotel cannot provide.One last tip, it is definitely possible to take the Narita airport express to Shibuya and walk to the hotel. However, if you want to do that, make sure you are adequately prepared to find the hotel, as it is a few pedestrian overpasses away and involves scaling some hilly sidewalks. Also, the Shibuya station is usually crazy busy, so take that into account if you plan on traveling with large luggage (it could be a stressful experience if you're lost). Don't be shy and ask the information desks which station exit to use and follow the signs. Alternatively, you can take the airport ""limousine bus"" directly to the hotel which is much easier.","Santa Ana, California","james y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Ana, California</strong>",7,5.0

It's just a few minutes walk from the main station there, so the location was excellent in that respect.

Our room was large and decorated very tastefully, and our city view went on for miles, so it really felt like we were perched on the top of Tokyo at times.The breakfast was fairly pricy, but very excellent. For those wanting to start their day like a local, it was a peaceful, zenned-out way to do so.The concierge was helpful in calling some restaurants we had researched, but the one Izakaya that they recommended was the worst meal of our entire trip, so I wonder if they're advice might be skewed, or just dated.

The hotel is located a few minutes from Shibuya Station, but we had some difficulties to actually get to the hotel with our luggage. Being spoilt by another hotel in Tokyo that offers a meet&greet service at the station, Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel kindly answered me by email that the hotel is to be found at the west exit of the Shibuya Station, nothing else. No mention which high rising building it actually is, how to get over the fly-overs outside the station or where the entrance to the hotel is. After some asking (luckily I had the name of the hotel printed in Japanese) and searching around, we finally got to the lobby of the hotel, where we were literally asked by a bellboy what we were doing there? We guess he was still learning English, because what would people with a suitcase be doing at the reception of a hotel? Anyway, we were checked in professionally, but we could not really feel as welcome as in other hotels in Japan. We were taken to the executive floor and when entering the room, our first reaction was really ""whow"". The views from the room to Odaiba, the sea and Yokohama were incredible by daylight and even better by night. When staying here, one can probably easily skip a visit to the Tokyo Sky Tree, you get the views here from your bed. The room itself was spacious and clean, the same for the bathroom, the colour scheme maybe a bit dull in different shades of dark brown. Unfortunately, the rooms are a bit noisy.Contrary to our impression at the lobby, the staff at the executive lounge was really great, helpful and friendly, the choice at happy hour and breakfast good enough for moderate eaters. We thought it was worthwhile to choose a room at the executive level, we sincerely enjoyed staying here.At the last day of our stay and holidays, we wanted to print our boarding pass, but this turned out to be quite an adventure. It could not be done at the executive lounge, so we were sent down to the lobby, where we were informed that we would have to wait until the business center was available. We could not be informed how long this would take (depended on the person using it) and we could not make a reservation neither. We decided to come back later, but we were lucky, at the moment we wanted to leave, the business center was free. We were informed the use of the computer costs 500 yen per 15 minutes plus 45 yen per printed page. This seemed quite expensive if you look at the price you already pay per night at the executive floor, but we had no choice, so we accepted. The ""business center"" is a separate room with 2 computers, one Japanese and one international and a printer. We tried desperately to connect to the internet, but nothing happened, had to search for staff to help, to find out that the entire computer had been turned off. When we finally got to print our boarding passes, the printer did not work and we needed once more help from the staff. The printer was out of ink... We needed almost 25 minutes to get something as simple as printing 2 pages done. Because of these problems, we did not have to pay for the use of the internet, only for the use of the paper, so that was a nice gesture. We were on holidays, so this was no big deal, but we would be extremely unsatisfied if we would be on a business trip and would need to use the business center for something really important. The location of the hotel is very central, it is practical to be able to take the shuttle to Haneda airport from the basement of the hotel (difficult to find), but the service at the lobby makes us wonder if we would choose the Cerulean Tower again, specially if taking the price into consideration.It is thanks to the staff at the executive lounge that we rate this hotel at ""very good"" instead of ""average"".","Luxembourg City, Luxembourg","snoringBommel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Luxembourg City, Luxembourg</strong>",96,4.0

The rooms are adequate, but they miss that extra caring touch that makes all the difference in hotels of this class.

We complained about this, and were assured that it wasn't the case. However, when we checked out, they did indeed attempt to charge us for the coffee.

I will say that we had come from the Marriott in Osaka, so Cerulean Towers had big boots to fill... Which unfortunately they didn't quite fill..Quite a pleasant room on the 28th floor, nice views over Shibuya station/scramble way - even had a brief view of Mt Fuji when the smog lifted one morning which was uplifting. However our first impression on arriving to check in was to be told that the pool/gym were not included in our stay... Considering the cost of our stay I think that was a less than stellar start. Move forward to our room - no complimentary coffee! Even cheap dives I've stayed in have complimentary coffee... (I realize these are small gripes overall, but given the price we paid to stay here AND the fact that Marriott Osaka included everything for much less cost - jus' sayin'...) I will say tho that the staff were lovely, housekeeping did a spotless job each time and the hotel was in a great spot for moving around and seeing the sights. I suspect had we have stayed here first instead of elsewhere my review would not be quite so judgmental (tho the lack of coffee thing is crazy, and should be attended to imo)... Bed was comfy, pillows were a bit weird to my taste and the bedside lamps are just annoyingly and immovably in the wrong spot. Very small choice of tv channels. Shower was great, great views from the bath as well. No moisturizer supplied in the complimentary toiletries. Cannot comment on the restaurants, as we did not eat in the hotel - I did find the prices quite high by comparison- but they certainly were beautifully presented. Would've liked to attend the jazz club onsite, but found a fairly pricy cover charge off putting. This was our first trip to Japan, and I understand that the Tokyo area is more expensive (like most cities)...so perhaps I'm judging unfairly between the two hotels in different cities - but I know which one I'd go back to again.

We have travelled to Tokyo and Japan many times and stayed at very different types of locations, first time at Cerulean, and very satisfied. Points to share :1) It is an excellent, comfortable. luxurious hotel , not brand new, but does not feel worn in any sense, well kept; a bit anonymous perhaps, but style is grand.2) Location in Shibuya is nearly ideal, less than 5 minute walk from the station, some uphill and over pedestrian bridges, but has elevator where you need it for luggage. Shibuya station area is under massive reconstruction but this does not pose serious nuisances for staying. Very easy to find the hotel - the tallest building in Shibuya.3) View from our 22 floor room (=not executive or top level) was outstanding - we were lucky to get the city side with all of centre from Shinjuku to Tokyo tower in sight. Even the bathtub had this view - amazing day and night4) It was a 3-person room, of extra size (corner room), but the third bed was just added, not 'built in', so even if space was large for Tokyo it was not like enormous.5) Note: WIFI is now free throughout the hotel, we did not have a special deal.6) No noise to notice from the very busy city below thanks to thick window glazing (aircon worked well and was also quiet)7) Breakfast was Ok fine, nothing grand or exceptional. We had to pay for it , so only did it once, plenty other options nearby8) Surprised we had to pay for the in-room coffee, was not indicated on checklist9) Awesome dinner at elegant European style top restaurant Coucagno (separate review), but also very expensive10) Efficient service (although we did not need much of it), no wait at check-in/out. We got our room around 1 pm, 2 hours before official check-in11) Main drawback. It was expensive! We were a bit late with our bookings so many good cheaper options were gone.

We had a huge bathroom, lounge area and two big double beds and there was no noise from within the hotel. Everyone was so happy, helpful and smiley. I can thoroughly recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in the city. The only complaint that I would have is that when we went up to the beautiful bar at the top of the hotel we were told that there was a 1300 yen (about £10) charge per person to sit in a comfortable chair at one of the tables even for residents. The only places to sit that did not incur this charge were at the bar or at the back of the bar on high stools. We decided to have some food there with a business colleague one night and even though we had 6 glasses of wine in total and 3 main meals we still had to sit at the bar. The views were spectacular and the atmosphere was super but the next night we ate out as we felt that this was a penny pinching attitude especially when we were spending a lot of money on accommodation and then subsequently more money on food and drink - to expect us to pay £30 on top of this was ridiculous.

Both were possible and the views are impressive. No need to book the breakfast option, there is a bakery with good take away coffee and fresh pastries in the lobby.Although not as luxurious as the Aman Hotel or Mandarin Oriental, this hotel has everything you need from a luxury hotel without having to pay £600 per room per night. The location is great for Shibuya - the famous crossing can be best observed from the Starbucks overlooking the crossing just 2min walk from the hotel. There is also a food market very close by with great sushi at Sushi no midori. You can also walk to one of the most popular shrines - Meiji shrine from the hotel or take the subway for two stops.

In our completely overheated room (2720) the smell got worse and turned into ""mold"" and ""wet dog"". We asked the bellboy to activate a Daikin streamer (cf picture) which was already in the room. (A streamer is especially made for purifying air form bacteria and humidity - we had to look up the machine because the operating panel is only in Japanese).Nothing happened, we called reception and they were sending up a technician. Meanwhile we took a midnight walk in the neighborhood. Upon our return the room was acceptable at the price of having a strong rattling fan noise. So we had to sleep with ear plugs. Everyday, the cleaning lady raised the temperature on the AC and cut off the air purifier. This meant that each time you got back to your room you had an unpleasant situation. This is evidence for blunt money saving at the back of the well being of the client. Dear hotel manager have you ever considered that an unsatisfied client might cost you more than a few marginal gains on the electricity bill. You proudly state having ISO 14001 - go ahead and subscribe green electricity, replace the old generation of air conditioners, clean the filters but don't compromise on hospitality standards!Same misery in the generously sized bathroom. The air extraction is not powerful enough. Humidity and odors stay for hours.Last but not least, the also generously sized closet has no shelves.

Another great plus about this hotel was the 7/11 connected to the outside of the hotel. Every morning I would go and get coffee for 100 yen. STEAL! The downside of this hotel is that to get to central Shibuya where the ""happening places"" are you have to cross the bridge because it's over a freeway and across the street. Now at night time, the elevator to that bridge closes around 10pm, so if your traveling with a stroller or wheelchair your SOL. You have to then go to another bridge several blocks down and trek your way up to the bridge that has a ramp all the way up.

Of course, Shibuya has tons of shopping and restaurants as well.The hotel is modern, very clean, with large bathrooms, especially for JP/EU standards. The beds are smaller than US size but fine. Staff speaks English and is super helpful. The concierge can help with tickets, reservations, transportation, etc. There's also a 7-11 convenience store attached to the building (though you have to go outside up the escalator) which is nice.Note that kids 11 and under are ""free"", meaning if they share a bed with there is no charge - i.e. you can have 2 adults and 2 kids in a double room (essentially two double beds). The beds are smaller than US (not Queen size!) - should be fine for the average US 8 year old or under but bigger kids and adults will be cramped.The hotel caters more towards professionals but I'd come back with my family.

I spoke with travel agents who pushed me to choose Keio Plaza or similar hotels and get 2 adjoining rooms. The Sakura suite at cerulean was going to cost more than 2 rooms at Keio. But it was worth it and cost effective. First of all, the kids loved sleeping on futons on the tatami mats every night. The beds were very comfortable. The area was cleaned and changed into a sitting area with a low table every day. The ""king"" sized bed could fit 4 people. The pillows and bed were so comfortable. This is from a pillow snob. My only one high maintenance thing. There is a ton of closet space. The bathroom is amazing- soaking tub for one and shower and of course, the famous high tech toilet. The bath products are L'Occitane. They provide you with toothbrush, razor, hairbrush and more. The outlets accommodate us plugs. The Sakura suite gives you access to club level. So here's the cost analysis: we saved money on breakfast included- not just any breakfast but 4 choices of great breakfast. Choose from buffet which has American and Japanese choices and fresh squeezed orange juice and Nespresso coffee (a favorite), Japanese breakfast at Japanese restaurant ( ceramic bento box tower with soup), club level room buffet or room service. We got 4 bottled waters free every day which was useful for the amount of walking we did. For some of the days, we used the cocktail hour at club level to have a light dinner with Chivas for my hubby. The fitness center/pool was free for us ( only able to use if 18 or over so not for our teens). These amenities saved us hundreds of dollars and made it similar in price but a much nicer room. This goes in the top 3 hotels we have ever stayed at and that keeps company with the St Regis, Four seasons and Ritz. It's worth it. Did I mention the view. Amazing view of Tokyo from our room and club level lounge. Location was easy for travel. Take JR train Yamanote line to Shibuya and exit from south gate (west exit). You walk across pedestrian bridge straight then right ( make diagonal to go across). Don't take New south exit. It was fine with luggage from Narita Express. We each packed carry on bag and a backpack. We packed quick dry clothes and rinsed our clothes out with powder detergent I packed. The bridge has ramp in center so easy to pull bags up. We are fit and used to traveling so it was not bad. But easier would be to take airport shuttle which would drop you to the front of the hotel. I would recommend this if you have bigger bags. Service was great and very friendly staff which keeps place impeccably clean. They will loan umbrellas but we packed small travel ones which I found easier than lugging big ones. 7/11 is on site and can be used to get money from atm. We would definitely stay here again. As an FYI, we went to the Keio plaza for a tour meeting point. Keio is Not the same caliber on how luxurious it looked and much bigger touristy place. This is not to knock Keio. I didn't stay there and it looks like a nice hotel but Cerulean is really first class. ","Orange, Connecticut","Dragonbaby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange, Connecticut</strong>",61,5.0

We had a Tower Executive room which was very large and well laid out. Good amenities in the bathroom. Stunning views over the city (towards Tokyo Bay in our room). With this room, you have access to the Executive Lounge on the 35th floor where breakfast, afternoon tea and then cocktails with snacks were served - all included in the room rate. The breakfast was plentiful as were the cocktails. The Lounge was very peaceful with accommodating staff. In fact, lovely staff throughout the hotel. A great stay.","London, England","PerryM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England</strong>",34,5.0

We were there around early December 2015, 2 rooms and added extra bed in each room. To my surprise, the rooms are more spacious than I expected. The lobby is decent with high ceiling. One more good thing to point out, the bus stop of airport limousine from Haneda airport is just located at its basement. At first we also hesitate as the price is at high side but we felt worth it after our stay as we really enjoyed it.","Hong Kong, China","GirlsHeaven</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",42,5.0

Yes, you need to use a footbridge to get there. Our room was big. so was our bathroom. and they have enough space for our clothes and luggage. We were just surprised that our room has no free coffee and tea. Unlike in most of the hotels that we go to that its free. Here, its not. We did not include breakfast as its a bit expensive. Since convenient stores are in every corner of Japan, we just got our daily coffee and bread from there instead. The pillows in our room were not comfortable. We had 3 kinds - soft-hard and hard & heavy. I should have asked for a replacement but kept on forgetting to do so. Airport bus transfers are available in this hotel, it's Y1,030 per person. Overall, this hotel is in a good location. Clean and hotel staff are always ready to assist you.",Philippines,"anritaa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philippines</strong>",27,4.0
