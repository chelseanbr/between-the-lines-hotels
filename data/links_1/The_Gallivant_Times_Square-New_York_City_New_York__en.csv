We had family from France flying to NY for the event. I had booked two hotels rooms for family to come and celebrate. The graduation was cancelled along with the rest of our travel plans. All of our flights were refunded except for the hotel. I originally booked a non-refundable rate which I understand the terms of that, however, these are extenuating circumstances, some that no one could predict. All I was allowed was a voucher for this specific hotel to be used within a year. My family from France certainly does not plan on flying here anytime soon and I am a healthcare worker still working many overtime hours taking care of those in need. I most likely will not be able to book these rooms again and will lose out on over a thousand dollars. Many businesses have been flexible during these times, I most certainly will be bringing my business elsewhere than the Gallivant Times Square.","Boston, Massachusetts","N9377VZelisac</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",0,1.0

I booked the PH has no balcony access, a shower that dripped all day and night, Tiny bathroom considering its a 2 B/R and the bathroom is through the bedrooms so not great if two couples booked it. I had a number of issues with the hotel and emailed the manager to discuss before doing any reviews however this has been ignored so now here's my review. I booked the PH for $2000 (just over - for my 40th Birthday treat) and my friends booked a family for $600. Her room was larger, had a huge balcony she could access and also had an extremely last master bathroom, the type you would expect in a Penthouse! I had no access to my balcony through construction (was not informed at any point, until I walked into the room to find out for myself) The door wasn't even secure and blew open twice during the night from the wind. The shower dripped all day and night and cleaners left towels in the shower tray to try and reduce noise, it didn't work and was very annoying when trying to sleep! The manager on site was polite but seems had no power to offer any compensation or alternatives which is ridiculous. I would definitely say if you're going to stay here, get the cheaper room. Youll be crazy if you pay what I did when you see what the other rooms get in comparison.The positive for the hotel is the location - 2 mins to Times Sq without the constant noise.",,lclare80nj,0,2.0

I do like it to be fairly cool to sleep but I couldn't reduce the temp as the fan was too noisy to leave on for too great a time.

Been to NYC 3 times now and this is by far the best location.Quick service - the hairdryer broke, rang down and new one at my door within minutes. Batteries died in the remote - same thing, less than 5 mins. Really great service in that way.Lovely smell in the reception area. Fancy fish tank.Cons:This hotel has jumped on the “resort fee” bandwagon. They’ve named theirs “urban tax” seen as referring to themselves as a resort is stretching it. For your urban tax, of a massive $35 per day, you get WiFi and a small bottle of water. Before this crazy charge such things were included or complimentary - to claim water and WiFi is an added extra in 2020 is a bit silly. So you might get a great nightly rate on your hotel site - but remember to add $35 to that! It’s a shame this hotel have jumped on this bandwagon, I hope this resort fee craze is the next thing to be regulated.Cleanliness - not great. I thought it could do with a good scrub when I arrived but it wasn’t terrible. Then on the last day a huge cockroach came strolling out from under my bed!! Gross! It looked like something out of men in black. I let reception know and went to breakfast so they could go in and get it, but they mustn’t have been able to find it because when I came back there it was right behind the door. My husband had to stand on it and it crawled up his leg. Absolutely disgusting. Now this maybe isn’t a huge deal to New Yorkers (?) but you don’t get these where I’m from and it totally grossed me out.Room is small but that’s to be expected in NY.So all in all points lost for the resort fee and the attacked of the giant man eating cockroach (ok maybe it wouldn’t have eaten me but it was huge)","Grimsby, United Kingdom","632alexandras</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grimsby, United Kingdom</strong>",21,2.0

I asked her how they processed payments as my card wasn’t setup for contactless or online payments & her answer was that she didn’t have a clue. I asked her to try my card again & again it declined. I asked if she could wait one moment while I logged on to the card app & she huffed & puffed even though I was the only person stood at reception.

I would not recommend for families or people who want to sleep at night. We were on the 15th floor and apparently there was a club or party doing on downstairs on a Friday night. It was SUPER loud even though we were so high up. If you're a light sleeper, you'll hate it. The rooms are small but cozy, bed is moderately firm, and the cable TV was pretty good. The fixtures and decor is modern. The water pressure and hot water were great. The outlets are not positioned in convenient places, so be mindful of that. Hope your appliances or chargers have long cords! Also, the shower has no door so water gets everywhere. The bathroom is super-small, so it's good for solo travelers or maybe one extra person. There's nowhere to store your toiletries. Also, the room temperature is tricky to adjust and the method to do it is archaic. One minute it was super hot in the room, the next drafty.They offer convenience of free check-in of your bags if you get in earlier than the 3 p.m. check-in, which is awesome. (I tried to call ahead to see if I could pay for early check in and find availability. They put me on hold two times and then third time just hung up on me. When I arrived, they claimed they had no availability for the early check in.) Also, the only other amenities they offer in the rooms is a mini-coffee maker (with pods and powder creamer/sugar).I've lived in NYC for years and now travel there on business so if you're not from the city and you're traveling with family or want space/better amenities, try either staying outside the city (in Queens or New Jersey) or tough it out in smaller spaces, less amenities and maybe not-so-friendly customer service.

Looking at previous reviews we were slightly worried but from a great welcome by the reception staff (male name unknown) we were allocated room 903 which was at the end of a corridor and found to be very tidy, small in size but perfect for a 3 day base. We did have roof top air con units and street noise outside but this is to be expected in the Middle of New York City. I class this as white noise as no sleep was interrupted. You are only 2 mins walk from Time Square, 5 mins from the Rockafella Centre and Hells Kitchen. Would advise if you want milk in tea, buy a small carton as powdered creamer is not the same.

The location of this hotel is excellent! Just off Times Square. You couldn't ask for a better location. The room was small but contained a queen sized bed, drawers, large flat screen TV, cupboard for hanging clothes and safety deposit box. The room was modern and clean. The bed was extremely comfy. The bathroom was small and the shower took a while to heat up but once it got warm it was a great hot powerful shower. The lifts were slow and small but we were on the second floor so walked down the stairs. We got fresh towels and the room cleaned during our stay. Yes you have to pay a deposit up front on a card but you get this back 3 - 5 days after check out so long as you dont use anything (room service, movies etc) The lobby area is very modern and has plenty of seating and smelt lovely!!! There is a desk in the corner next to check in where you can phone for transfers or book tours etc. There is free Wifi in the hotel which is fast and works. You just have to reconnect every time you come back into the hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. And I would recommend the chinese nextdoor. Set menu for $22.95pp!

We booked a deluxe 2 doubles room through travel republic. With all the bad reviews I was concerned, however I needn’t have been. The location is great - 48th between broadway and 8th Avenue. On arrival check in was quick and we were allocated room 1029. However upon entering it was clear this wasn’t the room we booked. This room was a box with 2 single beds. I went back to reception and the man showed me the confirmation they received from travco who travel republic use stating 2 single beds. A call to TR out of hours and 20 mins on hold to be told they couldn’t get hold of their hotel supplier that evening. Luckily the hotel advised they could move us and would temporarily hold the upgrade charge on my card until the supplier contacted them. They allocated us room 1228 and this looked exactly like the picture on the website. We had to leave a card for the security deposit of $50 per night, this showed as pending on my account. Several calls to TR and the room issue was finally sorted - confirmed by the hotel when we returned. The room had a large TV, coffee maker, safe, plenty of storage, hairdryer. The beds were comfy. The room was cleaned daily. There was bottled water available on reception. We didn’t use any of the facilities, on check out they charged our card for the resort fees - it showed immediately what I was being charged and the deposit released. I would definitely stay again price dependant. No complaints. ","Camberley, United Kingdom","cass1410</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Camberley, United Kingdom</strong>",146,4.0

Myself and my friend were told we would receive the refund in 7 days by the reception staff, it is now the 23rd of February and we have not received our refund.Positives of staying here:- Prime location.Negatives of staying here:- Be prepared for poor customer service, on arrival we were told to wait with no explanation other than the ""system has gone down"" (thanks to the guy on reception however who was very helpful in giving us advice and directions with a warm approach and friendly smile)- False advertisement/photography on website if you stay in a standard room, it is TINY, OUTDATED and GRUBBY; looks NOTHING like it does on the website - (I HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME ON INSTAGRAM AND I WILL SEND YOU THEM OVER @elliesole)- Ask if you are next to an elevator, we were disturbed nightly with the clinking and clanking of the elevator next to our room (700) - (I HAVE VIDEO EVIDENCE, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME ON INSTAGRAM AND I WILL SEND YOU THEM OVER @elliesole)- Be aware that there are no duvet covers, the duvet is placed between two bed sheets.- Housekeeping will not make your bed if you sort of, half make it (we were trying to be polite)- Check for all damaged items (and take pictures) as we had seen on reviews prior to arrival that the hotel has tried to take security deposits from travellers who have not damaged anything in the room.- No fridge.Overall, it was a pretty crappy stay; we put up with it however as we were out most of the day to explore.So, if you are looking for a cheap pit stop, for a night or two two explore the city then take my advice and I'm sure you'll have an adequate stay.If you are looking for a spacious, comfortable, quiet, attentive and reliable stay - I highly recommend you do not stay here.","Portsmouth, United Kingdom","ellie93xoxo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portsmouth, United Kingdom</strong>",15,1.0

Was quickly shut down by the rude receptionist when I questioned it as 'I will have been advised of it by my travel agent' - I wasn't, and I have taken this up with them.

It was part of a winter deal and When you pay little don’t expect too much. Firstly though good points, really handy for central Times Square, literally a few minutes and you are on it. Secondly only 7 blocks from the port authority bus depot. Take the bus from the airport for only 18 dollars each, far cheaper than a taxi (70 - 80 dollars). Close to Central Park etc. Handy for the subway only two blocks away. All the theatres are within a few blocks. Staff very good and friendly. The downsides would be the rooms, I paid an extra ten dollars a night to upgrade to a bigger room, would have hated to see what I was originally getting. Our room was basic and tired looking, the bathroom was tiny, a real reverse in and walk out to use the toilet. Our original room had no view due to plastic on the windows, also they were single glazed meaning we heard everything. We were on the 12th floor but could hear ones talking on the street below. Thankfully they agreed to move us. Can’t comment on the gym or pool as I did not use or see them. However, I had the privilege of having to pay a surcharge for them. If you do stay there allow another 40 dollars a day for the local taxes and facilities surcharge. The hotel is now just dated and is left behind by so many others in the area.

It appears that after checking our booking docs, there was no mention of a tax in our original booking T&Cs, however, this was later added via a booking ammendment email and we were not informed of this addition so be careful of that!Our room was underwhelming to say the least, we looked at photos of the standard rooms at the hotel online and the room we got was nothing like what the online images show. Please see the photos below.The radiator in the room (which was hanging off the wall) kept us both up all night, even when it was turned off weirdly! We had to complain to the front desk, to which we were told that we had one of the nicer rooms and that it was just the building and you get used to it. We eventually changed rooms, and it was better, but our radiator was broken and was constantly pumping out heat and could not be turned off. So we had to complain again to get this fixed.

I wasn’t staying there ! So basically I was been kept on the computer as staying there so they got paid by Hayes ! It’s disgusting and I’m sure illegal which I’m investigating ! I did get a refund on my last day , and Hayes are refusing to pay back my hotel stay that I had already paid for at the gallivant as I didn’t let them fix the problem ?! The hotel is unsafe so how could they fix that ? Fit a fire door , decorate the rooms and not charge me extras ?! The place wants investigating",,NorthStar623903,1,1.0

It took us about an hour to get to from JFK. When we arrived the reception team was very helpful in explaining the safety deposit and the tax. The deposit is $50 dollars a night and tax is $35 dollars a night. The tax is taken out of your deposit and the rest of your deposit is refunded to you if there is no damage to your room. The rooms are beautifully presented and clean. Housekeeping came to our room everyday to make our bed, empty bins and give us clean towels. The hotel also offers a 24 hour gym which is very clean and quite throughout our stay. The reception area had communal computers and printers to print off your boarding passes if need be. We was very lucky to be given a balcony from our room which gave us a beautiful view of some of the nearby buildings.

The rooms were spacious (twin room) and everything was perfect!That was until 9:30pm that night workmen started refurbishing every hotel room on our floor, we made complaints but these fell on deaf ears, the receptionist simply did not care and suggested we invested in ear plugs! I am not exaggerating when I say we had around 20 workmen outside our room shouting and working from 9pm-4am EVERY SINGLE NIGHT! Every morning we was promised that the works had finished on our floor, every night we had them back shouting. Turns out it was a check in mistake and we was never supposed to of been given the 9th floor but they refused to move us. When a room did become available I was offered to be moved to the 8th floor...where they has just started working, it was a complete joke! Our trip was completely ruined as we did not sleep at all. The reception staff did not care and were extremely rude with one stating she had bigger problems then me complaining about lack of sleep, when you have paid out for a trip of a lifetime I think anyone is well within their right to complain about blokes being outside there door all night with a master key! We was the only guests on the floor the first night and felt completely unsafe. We tried to speak to the manager everyday but she was either not in yet or unavailable, it go to the point that I had to email her for a response as we couldn't see her face to face. She has promised a refund via our booking agent but not heard anything as yet. The Hotel is nicely decorated and in the perfect location, if it wasn't for the works and the rude and disrespectful staff I would highly recommend. If you are booked to stay here over the next couple of weeks I really do urge you to call ahead and request a room away from the refurbishments.

It was nothing like the photos and we even wondered if we were put in the right room.The radiator cabinet was hanging off on 2 sides, the decor was different to the images we saw and the bathroom door had water damage. Bedroom walls are paper thin and the doors are not soft close so we could hear conversations and the slamming of doors. I think we only got one good night's sleep when we were there. One evening I saw there was a delivery of new mattresses for rooms and having woken up at 3am, it sounded like the noise of people unwrapping the mattress out of its plastic and the jostling of getting it in the bedrooms.

We booked two rooms a twin and a double. They were both on the 8th floor, the twin was bigger than the double and the twin to the front of the building was a quieter room then the double. The twin room: The sinks were not cleaned properly, there was hair on the sink when we arrived that was obviously from a mans shaver which had not been cleaned up. The shower where the dial pointed to 'Red' for hot was actually cold and vice versa. The water didn't flow down the drain so after a minute you were standing ankle deep in waste water. This then took about minutes to drain before the next person could get in. The beds were fine but they only provided one pillow per bed and then one spare. Our TV channels weren't lined up correctly for example the information page would say CNN but if you clicked that it would be a sports game etc. Our remote broke and they sent someone up very quickly to help. In double room: The heating system broke on new years eve and the room was like a furnace. While they sent someone up to 'fix it' straight away it wasn't properly fixed and remained very warm for the duration of the stay. The also suggested that we would get money back on check out however the receptionist never brought this up and we didn't want to cause a fuss as we needed to catch a flight. On new years eve we wanted to go to Brooklyn Bridge and I asked the receptionist the best way to get there, she didn't know and then gave me wrong information so be careful and double check everything on google maps. We booked a taxi with the concierge who was very helpful however, the taxi company he booked with sent a very old limo and suggested that we would travel with another family, this was fine with us and the other couple however, 50 meters up the road the car broke down and we had to wait for 20 minutes for another car which was a suv and was also not very new. I would suggest being mindful of the company that they book their airport transfers with as the new driver told us that things like that happen all the time.","Groningen, The Netherlands","Z3142QIlaurab</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Groningen, The Netherlands</strong>",13,3.0

I am really willing to spend some time focused on helping other people not to jeopardize their NY experience by staying at the Gallivant. My first room was on the 2nd floor and the scaffolding on the outside made terrible noises due to the wind and was really a hassle when it came to sleeping time. The windows were tremendously dirty and it was just sad looking through them - my fiancee and I tried to clean them but after our 4th attempt, the cloth was still coming out completely black. I can’t imagine how long it has been since it was properly washed. There wasn’t a desk with a chair on the room, and when I had to do something for work (about 30min/day), I had do utilize my notebook lying on the bed. The heating unit was overheating and not responding to the commands on the wall, the technician came in, couldn’t fix and his recommendation was we adjusted the temperature by opening the window - this is not a joke. I was moved to a 2nd room on the 10th floor. We don’t have any of the previous problems, but we were welcomed to a set of new ones: the safe was not working so I checked the batteries and realized they were being held by duct tape and cardboard (again, this is not a joke). I reattached the duct tape and it was functional again, but there is a great chance that it will come loose with all my stuff in there and I am not sure if the hotel staff will be able to retrieve my belongings in due time. The TV system is simply outrageous: if I connect my notebook through an HDMI cable (which I bought in NY just for this means) I can watch 30 min maximum before the TV blacks out and stops responding to any command. The only solution is to disconnect and reconnect the power plug, wait for the system to initialize, and watch another 20/30 min before it happens again. The exhaustion fan on the bathroom is not working and since it doesn’t have windows or any kind of ventilation, we have to spray perfume and wait sometime after we utilize it in order for the other one to come in - really romantic having to do this in the trip we became engaged. The night technician couldn’t fix it and said he had no spare parts to fix it. The front desk person said we should give it a try with the morning technician - who may have spare parts. All of those problems were noticed right away on our first night ant the new room. Morning came and I solicited a technician for the TV and fan. 30 min and no one showed up. I did it again, the front desk person said the technician was on its way but again, 30 minutes and no one showed up, so I left my room since I am on this trip to enjoy the city. After reporting these problems, front desk suggested we moved again, to A THIRD ROOM within our stay. Not only it is really frustrating having to pack everything and check-in at the reception, as it is a great waste of our scarce vacation time. On top of that, I am at a point in which I can already imagine what kind of problems our next room will bring us. I am not naive to think, after all of this experience, that the third room won’t have major issues. On top of all that, my fiancee tried to warn the reception that the beverage vending machine isn’t working (coins just go directly through to the change container and bills are taken in but the machine doesn’t recognize it - you just lose the money) and the response was “YOU should call the phone displayed on the machine and ask for maintenance” - again, I’m not joking and this was the actual response she got. I have traveled quite a bit in my life and had some bad experiences at hotels, but the Gallivant Times Square outperforms all of those and I can’t recommend it to anyone. The location is perfect and a part (maybe half) of the staff I talked to is really polite, but having in mind the price I was charged, the Gallivant gest a 0 out of 10.","Belo Horizonte, MG","athosmb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Belo Horizonte, MG</strong>",1,1.0

I’m giving them a 1/10 for proximity to Times Square only. We stayed from the 21-24th October. The room we had was smaller than our cabin on a ship but what l didn’t expect was that the cleaning staff didn’t even bother moving back the cupboards and desk that had obviously been moved around from last guest. We couldn’t access the cupboard drawers without having to reposition. Bedside lights weren’t working. Aircon inadequate. The drainage pipe was blocked so when showering water was filling up over the side onto the bathroom floor. We asked to move rooms which was approved. No offer of assistance by staff. Moved to a room on 4th floor. Traffic noise unbearable as we were closer to the road. They had a flimsy piece of plastic on the window. Not double glazing like most hotels. Room slightly bigger though. Twice we had had no hot water and the drain was also blocked, flooding the bathroom. When we went to front desk to report both they stated there was not a problem with the hot water etc. Totally dismissing us.....as if we were imbeciles! It took some heated demanding but they did send someone eventually to check.....though certainly did not act immediately. GUESS WHAT....we were right, no hot water. After lots of banging etc it came on and cleared the blocked drain. YEH! Our coffee/tea maker was broken so we had exchanged it for the one in our previous room. The downstairs stair door was outside our room so very audible most of the night from being used because the lift was so slow and bumpy. Even their own staff gave us the heads up that the stairs were quicker to use. The bumpiness was normal apparently. Staff had to use one of the 3 lifts so you could wait ages before one arrived. On each floor large linen baskets would remain near the lifts full of wet, soggy linen and towels. These baskets seemed to have a life of there own constantly obstructing the lift door or the passageway so you had to constantly move them to get by....Breakfast was a whole other bad adventure. It was next door by an adjoining door in a Chinese restaurant. The Continental bfast consisted of 1 juice, 2 sugary cereals, 1 fruit, a banana and a very limp, totally sugary, starchy, no taste pastry. Even remote outback Australia has a better, more wholesome selection. The Gallivant staff were not friendly, totally dismissive, unhelpful and obviously did not like their jobs. when there own staff tell you what is wrong with the place you know you are doomed. By the way we also had scaffolding outside the building and trolleys going up and down outside our room most of the day. A large glass panel above the front door was broken and secured by tape which had been there for sometime by its appearance....so they were obviously not in a rush to repair it. Could have been a potential hazard l’m thinking! This hotel was supposedly a 4 star but having now travelled extensively over the last 6 years in my opinion maybe a 2. Better suited as BACKPACKERS not a hotel. And for all the student groups that were there at the time l would say that is the type of patronage it gets. Actually l have been to much better backpacker accommodation than this certainly with far more friendly, approachable, helpful, obliging staff. Sadly this was not only our complaint as we met an English couple at a nearby pub who were also not satisfied with there room and were having to move. Because we all had paid upfront, to move elsewhere would have been exorbitant as we had paid $510 AU per night for this absolute appalling facility. We had booked it through a travel agent in WA/ Australia and once home put in a complaint to the wholesaler EXCITE HOLIDAYS, that fell on deaf ears...So for all you Aussie travellers please do not book anything through this company. BOOK direct to the USA companies if going to the USA who seen to look after their customers Also do not trust the photos you see on Gallivants website they are completely not trustworthy and they should be fined for false advertising.

The place was really dated, the staff rude, the front desk very unhelpful, paid the Urban tax and the refunded a days worth due to the downgrade, however less that 5 minutes later checked my bank and the took this back and is still showing on my statement.

We walked everywhere which was perfect. - Bunk Beds - Made it really easy for our family of 5 to stay. We didn’t find a ton of family options in this price range which is why we chose this place. - Room is small but it does the job. It was clean. Not brand new but we had no major issues with cleanliness. - Tons of great food options. Starbucks & Dunkin are right around the corner. - The staff was really sweet. The housekeeping service took care of us and made sure we had what we needed. They told us to grab towels or cups from the cart as we needed. Cons: - Sirens & Honking Throughout the night. It’s near a fire station so if you’re a light sleeper, bring earplugs. We slept ok but it definitely is loud. - Heater is loud & controls did not work. It was so hot we slept with the window cracked (with 30 degree temps & sirens outside) not ideal. - FEES: $30 Urban Fee, per day! Hikes your room rate way up. Total “extra fees per day” including taxes and urban fee came to an EXTRA $87 on top of the room rate. It adds up and although it’s not entirely hotel fees - travelers should know what to expect.

It was my mums birthday on the day we arrived too we hardly even got a hello. Not the best start to our trip. Is a shame the hotel didn’t have a bar as my dad rang the hotel to see if we could get a bottle of champagne for our room to surprise my mum for her birthday but they wouldn’t arrange anything which I’m sure they could off. The another bad thing I would say is our shower leaked badly and there was not always hot water in the morning for a shower. On the plus side our room was nice and clean the bed was very comfy.

This is my 8th visit to New York but my first time taking my 3 kids with us ages 6,10,13. We had a family room so had previously read that these rooms were much bigger than the standard rooms. I knew all about the fees we had to pay on arrival so was prepared for this. My kids all used the wifi and never had any problems with the signal. The reception was beautiful and nicely decorated for Christmas. Not once did we wait anymore than a couple of minutes for the lifts. This was never any problem for us. Our room was massive especially for NY sizes. We had two double beds and bunk beds. Bathroom was also very big with a big walk in shower, two sinks and very clean. We had a mini fridge, coffee machine and plenty of sachets topped up every morning. My only gripe would be the rooms need a wee tlc. Chipped paint, handle missing from the drawer but we were more than happy with our visit and wouldn’t let this put us off returning. It was cleaned every day and the maids were very friendly.

We could not open the wardrobe as the bed prevented was too close and could not be moved. i understand you will never get a big room in New York especially not the center but this was ridiculously small. i should be able to open a wardrobe door and fit on a bed for goodness sakeWe decided to go speak to reception as there was no way we could stay here. we spoke to reception and got told that there was no other rooms available apart from a room with two single beds which there was no way we were staying in, i did not bring my boyfriend on holiday for his 21st and spend all that money for this hotel only to be told we had to sleep in different beds and we would have to wait half an hour for the manager so we did and he told us we were in standard room and i explained there was no way that room is what is shown on your website for a standard room and that i would like to be moved rooms. got told i would have to pay for an upgraded room to which i explained that will not be happening as i have already paid for a room that i have not received and i was also on the phone contacting british airways during this as i was far from happy. and then as if by magic the manager said he can give us a room the same size as previous but the bed is bigger. We agreed to go view the room as it was the only one available we got told and we would not be able to move anywere else. the new had a proper sized double bed and the room was much bigger. not massive but large enough for two bodies and two suitcases so we decided this was okay. the bathrooms are so small you cannot move in them, i am 5ft 5 and when sitting on the toilet my legs were touching the wall in front it was very small even for New York. the wooden floors in the room were disgusting even after allegedly being cleaned, the room was facing onto the street so we had scaffolding out of our window which made the loudest noises throughout the night but as this was the last room we could not be moved. Our whole first day was wasted trying to sort rooms and wait for a manager who was extremely rude to us, told us we were wrong (which we were not as the photos on the website proved that), he was not helpful in the slightest until he released i was contacting British airways and i showed him the photos on HIS website to which he initially said was wrong and i said they are fro your website stating the size of rooms with photos. He was the most rude person!! the cleaning staff were lovely however, full of compliments and would always say Also to mention you get charged $34.42 per night per room as an 'urban fee' and 50 dollars per night per room deposit. This deposit takes 5-7 days we got told to go back on a debit card so they take it off and then you have to wait to get it back if the room is left with no damage, far too much money for such a shockingly bad hotel. they say the urban fee is to cover access to the business center which no holiday maker will be using, the fitness center and water upon request. also discount in the Chinese next door that is attached to the hotel discount off flowers, yoga class and mini bar delivery (THERE IS NOT EVEN A MINI FRIDGE IN THE ROOM AND NO ICE DISPENSER ON EVERY FLOOR SO YOU HAVE TO RUN AROUND THE HOTEL LOOKING FOR AN ICE DISPENSER AND TRY FIND ONE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS) we did not use any f these facilities so i don't understand why we had to pay such a high 'urban fee' RIDICULOUS!!!!.

The hotel is incredibly unclean, the windows are single glazed which isn’t desirable in the city centre and caused sleepless nights and I found some of the staff very rude. Our first room seemed ok, the beds were small but it was fine. However the bed was broken on one side as though the springs were missing so my partner had an awful nights sleep so we explained to reception and they changed rooms for us. However the next room was disgusting, it was unclean, it had other people’s hairs, the door in the room was going onto a construction site and yet again the bed was broken. So we then moved rooms again and had the same issue with both cleanliness and the beds. We then spoke to reception and they begrudgingly offered an upgrade and one night without the tax, which was appreciated. (I might add that the tax was unexpected and around 35 dollars a night so be prepared). I will also add that Rachael was so helpful & lovely, however we were then passed on to Cassandra who was very bolshy and spoke to her manager on the phone in a sarcastic tone about our reasoning for wanting to change rooms which was quite demeaning. The upgrade wasn’t hugely different, however it was slightly cleaner and this bed wasn’t broken, so after changing rooms 3 times we sucked it up. As a final point, we bumped into a fellow guest in the elevator who was extremely angry due to a number of live cockroaches he found in his room. If this doesn’t demonstrate the lack of cleanliness I don’t know what does - this is so disgusting and should not happen. The only positive of this hotel is the location, but I would not recommend nor would I visit again.

The ancient heating system was difficult to regulate and the window opened onto a jungle of noisy ventilation shafts from the hotel and other surrounding buildings. The window was also single-glazed and provided little protection from the noise of a New York night. We complained and were allocated another room on the 12th floor. This was slightly larger and a bit less tatty (although the bathroom tap was hanging on by a thread). The windows were also single-glazed and locked shut because of tatty plastic sheeting that had been stuck to the outside (presumably for insulation). Like the previous room, it was very noisy. There was a thermostat for the heating but it didn't seem to have much effect. Water spilled out of the (otherwise good) shower and flooded the floor.

However, our experience could not have been better. I was travelling with my teenage son and although (being cheap!) had booked us a double room. I asked at the desk if there were any twin rooms available. Cassandra, who checked us in, was really lovely and friendly and explained that there weren't any twins but if we came down the following morning and asked again there should be one. We went up to our room (very clean double, we knew to expect small rooms in New York so weren't disappointed), literally 5 seconds after walking in Cassandra rang the room to say that a twin had become available, so we moved. Our room was lovely, comfortable, clean and absolutely perfect for the two of us. If I have any criticism at all it's that there wasn't much of a view, but then we literally just slept there and there are plenty of other places to go for a good view of the city! A fridge would have also been nice but it wasn't a problem. Every time we went to or walked past reception we were greeted by really friendly staff (Suny and Cassandra in particular are a credit to the hotel) and given bottles of water to take out or to take back to our room.It was my third time in the city but my sons first time (we were there with my sister and her family for her 50th birthday) and we both had such a wonderful time, it was so nice to have some mum/son time together before he goes to university next year and staying at The Gallivant really made it special.

On going to our room we were immediately disappointed in he size of it given the money we were being charged per night. There was no chest of drawers where you could store your clothes, he wardrobe for hanging clothes was no more than a cupboard which also contained a wall mounted iron, ironing board and a safe so not a great deal of room to hang clothes. The bathroom was about 6 X 3.5 feet in size and this contained the walk-in shower, toilet and sink so if one person was in the bathroom all space was taken. If you were seated on the toilet your knees just about touched the wall in front of you so don't think about trying to read a paper while in the loo. So if thinking about booking this hotel don't believe the room photos you see online.

For instance:Better glazing to stop traffic noise.Soft Close doors. Constantly banging day and night.New air conditioning. It was like lying next to a jet engineCleaning and maintenance of shared areas was very poor.

We stayed on the 2nd floor (1st if British) and it has to be said the rooms are a little tired - dints on paint, bedside lights not working, no safe present (the last 2 were corrected the following day upon report) and a large housekeeping trolley was permanently parked just beside the door for the whole stay. Can't fault the hotel itself - although they do apply the ""Urban Tax"" which more and more hotels in NYC are doing. This is - basically - an additional security deposit which allows the hotel to advertise lower room rates - your card is pre-authorised a specific amount per night and, providing you don't trash your room, this is released within a week of your last night. The Gallivant fully refunded/released the pre-authorisation on my card in under a week - which was great service. Some people find this practice dubious but if you're in NYC with insufficient credit on your card - perhaps that's not the place for you because EVERYTHING costs a small fortune and THEN you have to tip!

We couldn't open the blind in our room which on one hand was a good thing as there was scaffolding outside the building during our stay and men working there all hours. There is no bar fridge in the rooms and one of the lifts kept breaking down making it hard to come in and out quickly. Luckily we were on the third floor so could walk down the stairs easily. The lobby is fine but one thing that puzzled us was that for a couple of days there was free small bottles of water available in the lobby and then not.

We booked a twin room. The website seems to make the rooms look a lot larger than they actually are - upon arriving at the room I was quite surprised at how small it was. Despite this, it was clean and comfortable and had an iron and ironing board too. The bathroom was however extremely small and was difficult to shower without the whole bathroom flooding each time!! Also, the location of our room (room 105) meant that our window view was of the courtyard of the hotel with big noisy generators outside - this didn’t really bother us as we only used the hotel as a base but may be disappointing for some. Sadly, upon arrival I was quite disappointed with the service of the gentleman on reception, it was clear that he was struggling to juggle all the jobs and responsibilities he had and it seemed very under-staffed. He was quite rude and abrupt which left a stale taste to the start of our adventure in New York, especially after travelling so far from the UK, it was rushed, not personalised and a bit of a let-down. The WiFi was good in the hotel and was free. Location wise, it was good and only a stones throw away from Times Square and close to subway stations. The hotel also offers a luggage hold facility for $2 per bag - good for those with later flights.

I informed the staff on the front desk about this 4 times for them to finally get it sorted. All they said was we will get an engineer to have a look. It did come on at the end but it was the end of the holiday so too little too late. The phone in the hotel did not work. The bed and the bathroom were tiny. The lifts in the hotel took ages to come up to your floor, it took about 5-10 mins, most people walked the stairs. Our TV did not work for the first few days we mentioned this to the staff and they just give us an paper with instructions on how to use it which didn’t help. My boyfriend had to tune it in himself. We couldn’t get the heating to work, the hotel room was freezing all the time. We had to confirm the booking of our shuttle so we asked one of the girls at the front desk to phone them for us (we thought it would be easier) and she didn’t seem very happy to help us out. She even got our flight time wrong even though it clearly said it on the shuttle voucher and then had the cheek to say we told her the wrong flight time but we never. All the information was on the voucher, she was just too lazy to look. The house keeper came round early morning 7:30, 8 and if you didn’t answer your door she would try your door, which I found annoying you could be asleep or in the shower. Only positive thing I would say was the hotel is right in the heart of New York, Times Square is on your door step, Central Park is only a new minutes walk away, Rockefeller isn’t far and the Empire State Building was only 30 mins away. I wouldn’t stay here again and I wouldn’t recommend anyone to stay here either. I never write bad hotel reviews or any reviews.

Excellent breakfasts too, but in an American hotel, surprised to find no hash-browns and no choice of eggs other than scrambled. You might find a banana if you are up early enough. Our room and bed were not large but comfortable and had all we needed. Best thing about the Gallivant is its proximity to good places like Times Square, many theatres and Central Park ( south end ) was only a short walk...Empire State Building , Top of The Rock and further down to Greenwich Village - along Broadway - or the High Line were all walkable, if you like reasonably long walks, but there are no hills to climb.

I appreciate that the Gallivant is in a prime location close to Times Square. The lack of any dining or beverage facilities were not ideal although not an issue given the close proximity of eating and drinking facilities close by. The location was indeed excellent and served as a fantastic base for our holiday. The location is the only positive I can find with the hotel experience however. Firstly, the room should absolutely not be described as deluxe (which i paid extra for). The room is very small and cramped with minimal space available. Consequently, there was nowhere to properly store luggage other than on the floor which served to further reduce the space available. The air conditioning unit in the room worked fine, but made a loud clicking sound everytime it swithched on - very frustrating during the night when the loud click wakes you up and then kicks in every few minutes. Turning it off wasnt an option as the temperatures were high during the week. Adjusting the temperature up helped to reduce the number of times the unit kicked in. I have stayed in many hotels across the US and never encountered that. From the second night onwards the unit began rattling constantly. The reception staff told us that the noise was from the outside unit, not inside and would not even send service staff to check it. We asked to change rooms and were told the hotel was fully occupied. The only way we could get it to stop was to kick or hit the wall beside the unit, which worked for a while until it would start again. We stayed on the 2nd floor so routinely used the stairs to get to our room (there are very few elevators and hence long waiting times), but the stairs were convenient. The stairs are filthy however, dirt on the floors everywhere and be careful of the doors slamming shut.

Instead, they put us in a tiny room with a king sized bed and a disgusting view and a loud airconditioning that we could not switch off. We talked to other people who also mentioned they had been put in the wrong room. So this is common practice at the Gallivant. Then, we were switched to our twin room, but the patio was not accessible. They reimbursed us 10 euros a night for this. Also, the rooms look very different than on the website. They are extremely small. False advertising. The hotel is not clean either. The cleaning staff does not clean certain areas. For instance, the area under the bed does not get cleaned. It was really dusty and filthy. Also, the walls in the bathroom do not get cleaned. There were several little hairs attached to the bathroom door. The staff also does not fill up the toilet paper. Very annoying! You don't want to worry about having toilet paper at night when booking a 4 star hotel. The shower is not easy to use, as you cannot choose how much water you're getting. You can only choose the temperature. The most filthy part of the hotel is probably the gym. I have never seen gym equipment look this disgusting. The treadmill looks like it has never been cleaned: there are so many sweat drops and filth on it. Also, two of the three gym devices, including the treadmill, did not even work... They charge you 2 dollars a suitcase to keep your bag for a couple of hours after check-out. Ridiculous. Lastly, and probably the most annoying part of our stay, were the elevators. There are only three elevators at the Gallivant, one of which never works. At certain moments, around 10 am for example, the cleaning staff blocks two of the three elevators, so there's only 1...

Im a US size 14 and just managed to get on the toilet due to it being in a tiny corner. The bed was OK but again just OK and definitely showing signs of wear. The room was adequate but didn't have guide as told it would and remote had half buttons working and AC was LOUD and all or nothing. We were on the 14th floor and even there the street noise was loud. The fire station is behind and every night it woke me at least once but to be fair my husband didn't wake. It was just clean as in I didn't complain but really could do with scrub of tiles and the AC needs a major clean up. THE REALLY BAD PART is the elevators.... Wow.... You could easily wait 20 mins for 1 at busy time and always at least 5 mins. 1 has been broken for 3 weeks and during room cleaning 1 is held for staff leaving 1 which holds 7 people for the entire hotel...

We were happy enough with the signal we got in the room though.There is no bar in the hotel itself, but there are two restaurants on either side of the entrance and also an Irish bar next door. The location of the hotel is really good too, a stone's throw from Times Square, close to NYC Sightseeing to organise your hop on/off bus tours, and within walking distance of Broadway and even the Intrepid.We enjoyed our stay, and would highly recommend The Gallivant Times Square.Kind Regards,Yvonne","Dublin, Ireland","Yvonne D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",44,5.0

The room that we had was much smaller than what had been advertised and from then it really just went downhill. The shower is located right next to the toilet meaning when you do have a shower, you end up with a drenched toilet. The AC turned out to be a positive apart from the fact you found yourself spending the majority of the time swatting flies coming out of them. The room is dirty, and when I say dirty I mean it’s not CLEAN AT ALL. If not for the house keeper I can truly say I would’ve been out the first night. The only other positive is that the Beauty of Times Square distracted us from the ugly room. There is no room service meaning that if you do want to eat anything you find yourself wandering the streets constantly trying to make up from the poor service of the hotel. If after reading this review you still decide to stay at this hotel then be prepared for a $30 (nightly fee) which they only tell you about as You are checking out, which apparently is an ‘Urban Fee’ from the hotel. This was never specified. (It seems the staff have no communication and social skills, which is surprising for a place that’s meant to be welcoming)DO NOT STAY HERE.

The hotel also whacks you a resort fee per night which is roughly $35. I’m sure common practice for NY hotels but was not made aware upon booking so watch out for this. There is also a charge of $3 per bag if you need to leave bags at hotel for a later flight - no issue for us but a little cheeky considering resort fee. Location alone makes the hotel worth a stay!

We changed our room 4 times!! All the rooms are tiny, you can’t open your suit case on the floor it’s that small. 1st room smells like Damp. 2nd room food over the floor, dust & white stains on the purple chair god knows what that was, 3rd the roof of the shower was disgusting green mould everywhere, 4th room was a little better but loads of small flies in the bathroom maybe like 30 every day. I asked to speak to the hotel manager after waiting 20 minutes. He told me he’s only worked there for two weeks. There’s no other rooms available (even though there was on the website) so thanks for Lying! so as a goodwill gesture after the first night he will refund me the other two nights & don’t stay with us. In all my life I’ve NEVER had a hotel turn away my business because the hotel is rubbish. If you know the hotel is awful don’t sell the rooms!! Lower the price, don’t advertise it as 4 star when it’s actually a 1 star & don’t lie in the pictures. All the pictures online are FAKE! When I told the manager our room is nothing like the pictures we booked, he told me they are fake pictures & all edited!! You can hardly see out of the windows they covered in dirt. No WIFI only in reception, Mirror light did not work in the bathroom. All the furniture has wood chips missing, Towel holder falling off, old crappy TV on the wall, paint missing on the ceilings & walls, no good views of the street in any rooms, noisy, toilet roll holder hanging off.

Never before have I walked away from a hotel. But this time we were basically forced due to it being in a bad state and the hotel not being able to provide a room that was somewhat acceptable even. The rooms were supposed to be renovated but everything seemed kinda old and worn out, the furniture was far from new and the photos had been photoshopped. It didn't look like the photos at all. There was a problem with the heating where it wouldnt stop working, eventhough it was supposed to be on airconditioning to the point that it started smelling like it was about to burst in flames. Electricity sockets werent working and the rooms were really noisey. Not something you would expect for a 200 euro a night hotel. The way the ""management"" responded was very unprofessional, when it turned out that maintenance couldnt fix the heating isue the manager apologised but said that there was nothing more she could do and that we just had to deal with it. We are talking about a problem with the heating constantly blowing at full heat and speed. It felt like a sauna. Regarding the Wifi the modem was supposed to be reset and that should solve it, but it didn't. Then the manager tried to blame it on our phones since we all had iphones. Eventhough the wifi was working fine at the reception, but it wasnt on other floors, clearly making it a receiving issue. After having checked 5 different rooms which all had the same problems we decided we no longer wanted to stay and wanted a refund. The manager insisted that we would have to pay for one night, on which we replied that that would be fine IF they could provide us rooms that were acceptabel. With acceptabel we agreed that there would be no heating issue and the wifi would be working. The new rooms we got again had the same problems, so we wanted to go. Having spent 4 hours trying to get a decent room it was enough. Unfortunately the manager didn't keep up to her side of the agreement and still wanted to charge us for the first night. Which we don't agree with and still expect a full refund or an other solution. During the time we were complaining multiple guests came downstairs to complain either about the heating or wifi. Looking at the recent tripadvisor reviews I think it pretty much confirms our experience. After leaving the hotel we booked a room in a hotel also on timesquare for the same price which basically was 10 times better, just to show it wasn't about us having wrong expectations.",,Journey79412,1,1.0

Reception on arrival was luke warm, not particularly friendly or professional. Our first night was uncomfortable, the room was a lot smaller than expected for a queen bed. The mattress was very poor - lumpy and seemed well past its sell by date, we both had back ache in the morning. One of the bedside lights was working but the fixture was broken and just resting on the wall attachment. The TV was not working and the room was generally tired and in need of decoration and updating. The bathroom was very small and would not have been suitable for those with mobility challenges or people who are large in stature. The windows were filthy and we could barely see out of them. It was incredibly noisy so the glazing was probably single. We asked to be moved due to the noise and matress and were told that all the mattresses were the same. We moved anyway and were given a larger and quieter room and the TV was working. However, the windows were still filthy and there was a step immediately inside the room leading to the bathroom that we tripped over numberous times as there was no marking to highight the step - floor covering was the same throughout. The last time I tripped I scraped my arm on the wall and really hurt my big toe. We highlighted this to the reception stating that this was potentially dangerous for elderly or infirm. There was coffee provided in the room but no tea so we had to buy own own tea bags. The extra charges of nearly $200 was a rip off as this was for extra amenities that we didnt get, apart from water that we had to ask for each time at reception - the tiniest bottles of water. On a positive note, the towels and bedding were changed each day, the shower was great (although it did flood the floor each time and had to be soaked up with towels - a bit dangerous), the iron and hairdryer were both working well. Having said this, I would expect this and so much more for a hotel that was not cheap.

We had 9 nights booked at Gallivant and had been travelling for 14hours when we arrived to the hotel (exhausted, as you can imagine). Firstly, there is no heating in the building, including hot water. When I called the front desk about my cold shower and inability to warm up the room on a 11degree day, they said the building was over 100 years old and they didn’t have heating. Only old boilers which they don’t turn on? Furthermore; the bedding is inadequate as there is only light sheets provided. We shivered throughout the whole night and the bed/mattress itself was so uncomfortable I couldn’t even get in a position where a spring wasn’t hitting digging into my side. It should also be noted that the walls are PAPER THIN! You can hear every single conversation happening in the rooms around you, even the relatively quiet ones... But the worst part - the sirens, the garbage trucks and traffic noise coming from outside throughout the night! The hotel is old and outdated. The “air conditioning” in the room is a dodgy unit attached to the wall under an unsealed window. The floors are uneven and I actually tripped getting out of the lift due to this. The rooms are tiny (standard for NYC, but don’t expect a place to leave your suitcase! Everything about this hotel is tragic and outdated. We moved rooms once because of our neighbours drunkenly partying and yahoo-ing next door (which is insanely painful when the walls are SO thin already) so I can confirm this wasn’t an isolated incident and only applied to one room or floor. When I called the front desk in the morning (almost in tears after the worst night), I was told that they’d “allow” me to leave and they would refund me the unused portion. Whilst grateful that I was getting my money back (god forbid they withheld it!), I asked whether I could also be refunded for our first night given all the issues... The manager flat out refused and said he was doing ME a favour by letting me leave with a partial refund! I understand that we did occupy the hotel that night, however the issues were brought to the staff’s attention during our first room move and we had no choice but to stay by the time we checked in etc. I told the Manager that I’d be taking this further as we now had to book a new hotel (Crowne Plaza across the road which is AMAZING) and needed as much money as possible to cover that stay due to high cost - which he responded to in an arrogant manner “that’s fine” and hung up on me! We are still waiting for our “incidental fee” to be dropped/refunded also. The worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at. I will forever have a bitter taste in my mouth due to the stay, but more the management. Don’t stay here... Simply, just don’t put yourself through it! It’s not worth it!

Like a shoe box, I couldn't believe the rate they were charging for that size of room.

So I was without a shower and toilet for a whole day. Then I was stuck going down in the budget lifts as it wouldn't go down to the ground floor.

Shower was good but water sprayed everywhere. Shower didn't drain properly.Wifi was average. Very slow at times, at others it was fine.We felt the basic cleaning in room wasn't good enough. Long black hairs everywhere (neither of us have black hair), feet were dirty after walking about floor, walls covered in dirty marks and the ice bucket was disgusting!Location was ideal for Times Square. Obviously it was noisy but you're in the centre of NY what else is to be expected :). Take an eye mask and ear plugs.I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless you were able to get an extremely cheap room and didn't mind all of the things mentioned above. We weren't in our room much apart from sleeping so it didn't ruin our stay but I definitely wouldn't return to this hotel.The POSITIVES were: comfy (small) double bed, good shower, excellent location for Times Square, very pleasant staff (reception and porter) and the Chinese restaurant attached to hotel was great! These are reasons why we gave any stars on this rating.","Irvine, United Kingdom","R K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Irvine, United Kingdom</strong>",6,2.0

Right off Times Square so your dead central. Brilliant for a first time holiday in the city as its very easy to find your way home and youre close to all the tourist stuff. The bed is comfy if a little small. I'm about 5'10 but anyone taller than me would be having chilly feet. The room is cosy. It fits everything but theres not a lot of free floor space so you'd notice an open suitcase. But you're out in the city all day so you dont notice the small room. The bathroom is gorgeous. We had no issue with hot water and the water pressure was sexy, I had a shower every morning!I dont know where people are coming from when they say the room was cold!! Ours was too warm of an evening so we stuck on the aircon for 20 minutes before we went to bed and that cooled it right down.The staff were friendly and helpful and we had very little to do with them. We left our bags with the concierge before check in for free and paid the 2$ per bag to mind them after checkout. Theres also a free to use weighing scales you can use if you're flying.There are two small elevators that only fit 7 people at a time. Now we only had to wait for a lift twice during our entire stay and tbh we could have just used the stairs only we were lazy so it wasnt an issue for us.

NO WATER in the hotel for a full day from 8am to 5:30pm (meaning no showers or flushing toilets) - completely unacceptable is a first world country. Who is their right mind would pay for a hotel which doesn’t have running water. Note, we were provided $28 as compensation for not having running water however this was after 3 heated conversations with front desk. 4. Front desk customer service was stand off’ish and smug.

Manager advised that Booking.com had cancelled the room however when I spoke to a different member of staff at a later stage they said that it was the hotel had cancelled the room. My biggest issue was the treatment we received we had no room, despite it was paid for and there was no apology. The manager was quite abrupt and did not even look up when speaking to us. I have to say the room was lovely and it was clean and we slept well but the arrival to the hotel was shocking. My daughter was crying as she was so tired and thought we would have to go looking for another hotel. Why would a hotel give away a room that has been booked well in advance and paid for. My only guess is that the hotel was trying to make money twice on the room which is so dishonest. I would not recommend this hotel and I will be posting my update on TripAdvisor to day.

I don’t think I got adequate heat once during my 5 days stay. Did think about complaining but having waited so long for a lift to reception, I just wanted to get out and about. Free bottled water advertised for your resort fee however twice they had none at reception. Bunk beds? Top one I did not believe was safe the sleep in as the guard was less than adequate.

We looked around but there was no way of turning it off? No buttons on the unit either! We called down to reception where we were told that there’s a switch on the side to turn it off (I had looked there was no switch) So I explained there was no switch and eventually they said that someone would come up to have a look! so while we was waiting my daughter said she would have a shower only to find the shower only come out with cold water I then rang down again and they said please let it run for 10 minutes so after 15 minutes it was still cold so we left it and after 30 minutes it was still cold so I rang reception again and said this is unacceptable we have freezing cold water from the shower no hot water & the air-conditioning is on full and freezing cold so please can someone come up and sort this out! After an hour and twenty minutes later someone came up and accepted that there was no way of turning the air con off so he had to take the unit case off to disconnect a switch which was inside the unit!Then the shower was still cold so he said we would need to go to reception to ask to change room?We went down and was explaining everything to a gentleman on the desk when a lady came over who was listening & said very rudely “Oh Just give them another room it’s too much aggravation!” I just looked and said seriously she needs some lessons in manners! The new room was fine and the beds were really lovely that was a huge bonus! We had tv and WiFi & a coffee machine the shower was hot apart from 3 days when it ran cold due to issues that the hotel had but they then deducted the service charge for those days off our bill! To be fair the Hotel was in a fabulous location literally by turning right outside the hotel it brings you to Times Square So if you can put up with the downsides the plus side is you are in the middle of New York so you can get to everything so easy Having a comfortable bed really helped me get over the hiccups and as you only really need a clean room and a decent bed I was able to enjoy my holiday with my daughter for her 21st ,"Harlow, United Kingdom","juleslovesnyc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Harlow, United Kingdom</strong>",8,3.0

So to start off with we arrived to a rude receptionist then when arriving in our room we was completely appalled at the size of the room and the state of it, we could hardly fit 2 suitcases in and still then the door was hitting off them, the wardrobe could not even fit my cabin bag in, we had no natural sun light, the air conditioning had to be turned of during the night because it was too loud even for one of my family members who is profoundly deaf so you can imagine the sound and the bathroom was so small I could just about sit on the toilet and my legs didn’t hit the wall by centimetres and I’m 5 ft 5 so you could imagine the problem my boyfriend had when he needed the toilet. We went straight to the manager and also found the price of our room went down from $2300 to $800 online so we went to explain how we wanted to be upgraded because our room was unexceptable and we was obviously ridiculously over charged. So we asked if we was able to either be given a refund because the confirmation says the hotel price matches if you find the room cheaper and if that wasn’t possible that we could be given free breakfast if they wouldn’t price match ,we was refused price match and breakfast. To add to this we was even told by the cleaners that “everyone moves rooms when they arrive because no body is happy with their room” and every passing guest that walk by in this moment agreed and told us the problems that they was having too. I brought this as a gift for my mother who is visiting for the first time and my boyfriend I spent $4600 for two “standard rooms” and I was upgraded to “king size” which the hotel told me I was lucky to get even though the king size cost $1200 by the time we was there so we still lost out over $2300 we have had an awful start to our holiday and I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

In addition to this the door was broken, it kept catching and you had to force the door shut.We told the hotel employees about this on three occasions, all three occasions we were told it would be fixed or we would be offered a new room. This never happened. We utilised the safe in our room to keep our valuables safe, upon arriving back from a day of sightseeing we were unable to access our safe due to an error code. A member of staff did come up to fix this and I asked why the safe was broken she informed us that the passcode had been incorrectly entered too many times. However we had not attempted to access the safe all day. I became concerned incase the house keeping staff had not ensured the door was properly closed and someone may have entered our room and attempted to open the safe. I expressed this concern to the member of staff who quickly said it was an error with the safe however we still had doubts about this and asked about cameras in the corridor which the hotel DOES NOT have.

Unfortunately the positive aspects stop there for me. From day one I had to repeatedly complain about the WiFi being inexistent in my room; I was banking on this as the place where I could check NYC's map, where I was going for the day, opening times/prices for places I wanted to visit, weather app, WhatApp and other social media usage. I was told rather dismissively on the first day that, whilst yes, the signal was poor, it was probably because I had 'x' many browser windows open and had I tried to turn it off and on again. I found this very patronising, and frankly insulting to my intelligence, as it was clearly the WiF, not my phone. Nothing was ever done about it, and nor was I given any kind of apology about not being able to use the WiFi in full in my room even though it is included in the list of services paid for by the Urban Tax ($35 per day) charged at the end of my visit.I also remarked several times that the TV in my room was not working (it was essential the equivalent of watching TV in the '80s with a bad aerial signal); whilst I clearly did not visit NY to watch TV in my hotel room, I consider this to be a basic, so that I can watch the news in the morning, maybe catch a late night show before falling asleep, etc. For two days nobody came upstairs to check, and only on the third day (when I had finally given up and unpacked all of my stuff) was I offered to switch rooms, which I was reluctant to do anyway as I had no idea what other issues the new room would present, thus I thanked them and declined.The cleanliness of the room was down to absolute basic, I doubt anyone ever decided to sweep or vacuum under the bed, which had clearly collected dust from years of guests. (I only had the misfortune of noticing this because I dropped an earring and had to put my hand down there); also the bathroom was so small that I had to essentially play tetris to use it.If by mistake you'd like to sleep an extra hour one morning because you walked around so much the previous day and you are exhausted, forget it; the cleaners will make sure to shout at each other or down their phone from very early on, never mind a few 'do not disturb' signs.In short, a very bad experience for me, not worth the money.","London, United Kingdom","Sightseer37855926407</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",0,2.0

I noted that some of the lights in my room were flickering, some wouldn't come on at all, the door handle on the balcony was broken, the room was very hot due to what seemed to be an HVAC issue, and I was having trouble finding an outlet to plug in my devices. I went out to explore the city. When I returned, it was slightly cooler in my room (still very hot), the flickering lights had been replaced, and there was a new clock radio on the night stand with USB ports for my devices, but the door handle was still broken and the heater still would not cycle off. Because of that, I slept with the balcony door cracked to let in some cooler air and unfortunately heard street sounds all night. The bed and pillows were very comfortable.

The shower in the room has been lukewarm on 2/3 of our days here and today, it is like ice cubes coming out the tap.

As a result of this confusion the hotel said they only have rooms with double beds which was not acceptable for me my dad to share! I showed my booking confirmation from BA and eventually they sorted us out with a new room.The room - Had three beds! A double and a bunkbed (maybe a family room) it was clean and spacious. The heating in the room was either hot or cold or off! Nothing Inbetween but this wasn't much of an issue.Location - Great location but expect it to be noisy 24 hours a day! Traffic on 8th nearby and it's relentless! Regardless of this I actually slept well and the bed was comfortable!Staff - Helpful! Deposit - Having never been to the states before I wasn't up together with credit card swipes for ""damages"". This wasn't an issue but the hotel earmarked 250 US DOLLARS without informing me they would! When I went to question this I saw a sign explaining this...it hasn't come back to me yet but hopefully it will soon!

Our check in experience was poor the receptionist was rude barked at us in broken English seemed to have very little patience. On entering the room I was met with a musty smell and an irritating buzzing sound. The room was cold and there was a draft and no amount of messing with the heating system made any difference. The room looked nice initially but it soon became apparent it was run down and in the need of a facelift. I’m so glad we had booked elsewhere for the other night due to the absurd amount they were asking for a second night. Had I do bit the bullet and paid that amount I would’ve been bitterly disappointed! Wouldn’t stay here again and wouldn’t recommend! Only good point is the location as Times Square is a stone throw away.

On arrival, clean room (pretty small ‘deluxe queen’) but adequate for a 7 night stay in a busy city. Room was located on the front of the property. The room was quite noisy and again I expected that with it being such a busy city. The hotel is located around the corner from a fire station so expect sirens to be sounding all night. The location is great for the city and is walking distance from Times Square and Central Park. In fairness my partner and i only used the subway once during our whole stay. The rooms are clean and relatively modern with coffee and toiletries provided. I did have to request extra creamers for the coffee as occasionally the maid left us short and I also Had to ask for the hairdryer which was not provided in the room. The hotel has 3 lifts which were all working properly and we rarely had to wait to use them. The water was always hot and I know previous reviews have stated otherwise but we didn’t have an issue during our stay. On our arrival we were asked to provide a credit card (which we did) and were told that this was to cover any ‘damage caused’ to the room. We were happy with this as this is standard practice. We enjoyed our stay and checked out early for a 10am flight back to the UK on our last day. On check out we handed keys back in and we knew that there were no charges to be added to the room. On our arrival back in the UK my partner was charged £176 to his credit card ($230) When he queried the transaction it said that the card pin and signature had been used. At NO TIME did he authorise The Gallivant to charge this money to his account. We were not informed of this charge by the hotel or by BA. On reading reviews I have gathered that this fee is possibly a resort fee. The resort fee is used to charge for WiFi, gym and water. We didn’t used the gym, we didn’t have any water, and the WiFi was slow and extremely intermittent. The hotel website advertised “free WiFi high speed internet’ Which it clearly isn’t. We are now in dispute about the transaction with the credit card company. Be aware of this before you book or make sure you fully understand that these charges could be applied to your account without your knowledge.

My only moan really is the breakfast. We were booked as continental breakfast and it seemed to be in an adjoining Chinese restraunt. Very basic to the point of polystyrene cups and bowls.

Air con unit is very dusty but not a huge problem.Went to have a shower and find that I’m aimlessly turning the handle and no water comes out. The handle is on top of the toilet tank!! Call reception to which they send a technician. He arrives and puts the handle back on.. he leaves and I try to turn the shower on. Handles falls off we eventually get it working and my partner goes for a shower.. same happens again!! We are not ones to complain but just laugh it off. Shower is powerful enough but the glass screen does not shelter enough so you basically walk into a flood/bath on the floor when coming out.Our friends staying here mention that there is a usb charging adaptor as I forgot my adaptor so I call reception and ask if it is possible to borrow one as our room did not have one. He abruptly and rudely said that not all rooms have them and this is not possible. I replied that surely as our shower handle is broken that maybe a usb plug was a small ask... he said that your shower is not broken the handle just falls off .. ok fine.... With high hopes I thought there might be a usb hole on the back of our dated tv.. no just layers and layers of dust!Just find it very bizarre that we paid the same price as our friends and our room is at least half the size!!Just wish they were more focused on making our stay more comfortable especially things that do not cost or put the hotel at a disadvantage.Would we stay here again? Probably not as not a good experience so far but will change review if our stay improves and the shower handle decides to stay on Best of luck if you stay here ",,sallyj08,1,2.0

Before arriving here I was some what apprehensive as I’d seen reviews that weren’t great. We actually had a premier room which I was completely unaware of! Haha. So that was a lovely surprise. The room was big and spacious with two bunk beds and a queen sized bed which was unbelievably comfy! Along with the normal facilities you would get in a hotel room. The bathroom was lovely too although I would suggest laying a towel down on the floor outside of the shower as it. can get quite wet as there is only one glass pane that doesn’t move. The location is amazing! I’ve been to NYC twice before but this hotel came out on top as it is so close to Times Square, you couldn’t ask for better. Subway is close too and so is a local shop along with a pub next door. So everything was literally at your doorstep. I’ve seen that people have complained about the fees that are required and I had also heard someone moaning to the receptionist about the fees too but I paid a holding fee at the start of the holiday and when we left and got back to London I was charged £91 in total for fees so I was happy with that considering from what I’d seen I thought it would be worse. Also, staff were nice too and so were the cleaners. Anyways, I liked this hotel and would happily come back here next time I come to the city. So thank you!

Our room had marks all over the walls, dirty windows, missing draw handles, no shower curtain, wires hanging out the air conditioning, hairs and plastic in the plug from the last guests.We went to reception and asked to be changed room, no question was asked why or no apology. 2nd room wasn’t much better but after a long flight and transfer we couldn’t be bothered going back to change the 3rd time.2nd room had a safe loose on the floor that didn’t work, rang reception later in the day to fix it put new batteries in it but still never worked, had cracked sockets, dirty windows and noisy air con that randomly banged every minute, no ironing board and a bathroom you couldn’t swing a cat in. On check out no questions asked about the stay. Also seemed very sneaky about the hotel taxes, was asked if they could take my ID and credit card never said why assumed for a room deposit and then gave me a piece of paper nothing said later in the room read it and said there was a $35 a day fee on top of what we have already paid.

It has everything you need, you are in the heart of Times Square and close to everything. The rooms were always clean, although the room was slightly small, it was just a base for us, fresh towels every day, coffee is always refreshed (no tea unfortunately so take your own). If you want quirky places to eat just ask the reception staff who were always happy to help and recommend some hidden gems, it does have restaurants either side of the hotel and we ate in the Korean BBQ restaurant at least twice as it was lovely! There is free WiFi in the hotel which was great, please note that they do take $150 deposit on a credit card before you check in, this is kept until you check out in case of damage to the room. Also note that they charge a hotel tax of $25.00 per night per room so factor this into your spending money, this is paid at the end of the stay. Overall we would highly recommend this hotel for a short stay to NYC. We would also recommend using the Top View Hop on Hop Off bus, it’s the easiest way to get around NYC, it includes the ferry around the Statue of Liberty which was amazing, night and day tours which are also amazing, it was $136 for two people for two whole days and nights, we got to see everything with these buses and you can get off or on wherever you fancy! NYC is an amazing place, I recommend going to the Top of the Rock to get the best views of NYC and get all your pictures. Make sure you go to M&M world it’s over three floors and lots of fun!Like I said New York is amazing and I’m glad we got to experience it, take lots of spending money (it’s very expensive) and make sure you tip, it’s a way of life out there. I hope my review has helped and I hope you enjoy this wonderful hotel and New York City as much as we did.

Bit the bullet and went for it anyway. Location is excellent, Times Square not even a 5 minute walk. Receptionist very friendly, nice interior. Room overall okay, modern design however definitely lacking a few touches- paint cracked and peeling on the skirting boards, felt tip pen on the white bed headboard?!, didn’t get a great view from the window. However these were only minor things, particularly as when you visit New York you barely spend any Time in your room. Only let downs were that one day our hot water was not working so my partner couldn’t have a shower, we did report this to reception who said they would investigate. The TV only had one channel which was news and that as an extremely awful picture, but again not major as we barely watched it. Only last grumble for me was the whole issue with city tax. The rate is $34 a day, which seems pretty extortionate. This is apparently for WiFi, gym and drinking water. The WiFi worked fine in our room, however we did not use the gym so not sure why I should be paying for this? Also the drinking water was not made known to us, only discovered on our last day that we could go and collect water from the desk- why not put it in the rooms and change it when the maids replace the toiletries? Upon arrival you are required to give a bank card for them to hold your details, was told no charge would be made. Upon check out the receptionist handed me a receipt for the city tax which they had already taken from my card. I didn’t mind as I would of paid this tax on card anyway, however I do think they should check with you first how you would like to pay, as people may want to get rid of their dollars on the last day. Also wanted to raise the issue that I wasn’t very happy about paying this whole amount as I didn’t use half of the services (water and gym) and one day we had no warm running water. A good stay, value for money but just keep in mind about the city tax, as it may not be great value for money by the time you have added that on top.","Birmingham, United Kingdom","Shan B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, United Kingdom</strong>",0,4.0

After reading reviews on this hotel months before hand I must admit I was dreading arriving at this hotel. Its my 3rd time to New York but my fiancée's first so I didn't want anything to ruin it for her. There was absolutely no reason for us to be worried. on arrival into reception we were dealt with by a very professional bloke who only charged us the city tax fee and not security deposit that I have read that other people were charged. We were handed our room keys and went straight up to the room on the 5th floor. The room was so much better than I expected, you would think people were sleeping in the back lanes the way some people have went on about them. The room was very clean, bed was so comfortable, TV signal was perfect, Shower pressure was perfect allow we didn't have any hot water. the next morning I went down first thing to get this fixed and within 2 minutes of being back in my room the handyman was knocking at the door to fix it which was brilliant service. Room is a bit warm and the air con didn't seem to blow out cool air so I just cracked the window open slightly and it was sorted. People are right you couldn't swing a cat in the bathroom but luckily I left my 2 cats back at home so no issues there. Rooms cleaned everyday and towels refreshed.

A great plus when you have just stepped off a 7 hour flight and endured a 2 hour transfer!Rooms were spacious enough for New York. If you are expecting a vast room with a huge bathroom and walk in wardrobes then you will be dissapointed as New York is not the place for this.Beds were comfortable and the room was cleaned every single day without fail. Couldn't fault the staff at all. Decided to give the shuttle a miss on the way home due to the long transfer times to the airport. Booked a taxi with the concierge and he could not have helped more. He stored our bags for the day and the taxi arrived bang on time. He is a great credit to the Gallivant!Only small issue was that the first couple of days the shower in the room was extremely slow to warm up, hence the 4 star review. Left it running for 10 minutes though and then it was perfect. Please don't let any of the negative comments put you off. It is more than adequate as a base for exploring New York. As said before, the location could not get any better! Great value for money.

Secondly, the bottled water is not put in your room daily and something you have to ask for, and when you do, it’s warm (there is no fridge in your room)!! Thirdly, the worse ‘high speed’ WiFi I have ever seen... it really is hit and miss as to whether it works!

The next room was standard, but when we went to check out in the morning they wanted to charge us again the full price of the room. Management was slow and unsympathetic in solving the problem, which still resulted in only a slight reduction of the charge. The hotel was loud and the services offered didn’t match the price.

As I'm washing my hair, eyes closed & fully under the water, I noticed a slight temperature change in the water so opened my eyes to adjust to find that the water surrounding me was Dark Brown. I was bathing and washing my hair in completely dirty brown water.

I told her I needed a supervisor to come up to my room immediately.

Being a traveller this was slightly unacceptable due to being out late at night to enjoy the city.Also, whatever time of day you are there you can hear room service wheeling their trolleys around the hotel. (This was VERY noisy) The room was nice, however way too small for friends sharing. It would be more suited to couples or lone travellers. The Tv's reception was very bad and the screen was always grainy and unwatchable.I would stay again, however only with a partner or by myself. As a frequent traveler, location is very important to me.

Other than the WiFi it’s really good value for money and you couldn’t ask for a better location.

They gave us a room upgrade on checking in so we ended up with a room with a double bed, bathroom and then a seperate section with a set of bunks (which we used for our luggage). The rooms are not overly spacious, but they don't feel too cramped either (except for the bathroom). You are REALLY close to Times Square (which is great if you are seeing an evening show) and various subway stops so it was incredibly easy to get around. It is also a nice walk to Central Park and the many shops around there. It is directly next to a fire station though, so it was hard to sleep the first few nights as we were often woken by sirens (couldn't believe how many would go off in 1 night!). However, we did get used to it. Personally, if we came back to NY we would stay in another part of town, such as Soho or Brooklyn, due to the sirens and the fact that being so close to Times Square got old quite quickly (it's hectic!). However, it is a convenient location to see different parts of New York and the hotel itself is nice.",,Emma J,8,4.0

Maybe there is bigger rooms in the hotel or a suite you could request. The room was generally clean. Some areas could do with a deeper clean on closure inspection. We had nice fresh wallpaper on our wall so I think the rooms are getting a makeover. The bed was comfortable and the TV had some decent channels. There was a iron and coffee machine also. The aircon unit could be noisy at times. Check out was busy but moved quickly. Baggage Porter was friendly and efficient. The location of the hotel is excellent. Outside noise was minimal.

Check in was quick. Man on the desk had a bit of a chat wished me a merry christmas so i explained that it was my birthday first. He asked when so i told him to find out the other guy who was with him on reception was the day after mine. Asked for a credit card for the hold charge and that was it, all checked in. No other charges were taken due to me booking a package with british airways. My room was on the 13th floor. I had booked a single room as it was just myself and i was only sleeping and showering there. Room was small. Had to sit with my legs on the bed to open the wardrobe each day. It was clean untill i found a few ants crawling around one morning before i went out. Simply poured boiling water on the source and i didnt see any after that Room had a heater that was noisy but had to have it in cool all the time as the room was so hot. Im usually always cold so dont usually find that a problem but the heat was too much for me. Room also had its own balcony. Not much of a view but it was ok for me. The door was slightly stiff and didnt close properly like there was a slight gap in the frame almost like it had been sprained at the hinges. Didnt find it an issue though as i was on the 13th floor. It was very noisy due to the location but for me that added to my experience and once id turned the lights out and blinds were down i was sound asleep from being busy all day anyway. Maids came each day with towels etc but no toiletries. I always take my own just in case but none were replaced when used. Location is fab. 5 mins walk from all the the glitz and glamour of times square. Easy to find the hotel from 50th street station when traveling from the airport by subway. Upon checkout i left my case and rucksack with the bell man for 2 dollars per bag. He asks what time you'll be back to collect and then threads and chains them around the sofas in reception and secures with a padlock. Asked if i could print my boarding pass but the printer wouldnt print. After a few mins playing around and using a different programme to open the document i finally managed to print it out. Although the lady on reception said if i emailed it to her she would print it for me if it didnt work the second time around. Couldn't have asked for more really for my first time in new york. Id stay here again as i had such a positive experience overall. Im one of those people who isnt picky about places unless it really deserves to be brought up. Just go and enjoy yourself.

We arrived in good time but were not greeted by the staff and hauled our own luggage in ( i know this sounds lazy, however, having been to New York before it is customary at most hotels for the Bellman to attend you upon arrival). The receptionist was pleasant enough, however, she only booked us into 1 room (two couples)! Upon realising this, we had to go back down to reception to sort it out(not what you want to be doing after travelling for 18 hours). The guy on reception wasn't very helpful and even tried to argue we had only booked one room - even though our paper work showed differently. Eventually we got it sorted out, however, the reception staff were very short on giving information and didn't explain the debit card bond situation very well. All in all, not a very professional start.The room was clean and tidy - nothing flash, but for a budget hotel not bad with all the amenities and coffee making facilities and a secure safe. The only draw back was that for the entire 5 nights we were there the bed sheets were never changed!The staff were not very approachable and appeared to not want to be there and the only time i saw a smile was when we were checking out.Overall, it wasn't a bad stay, but I've had a lot better from a similar hotel only a block away.","York, United Kingdom","loppylowe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>York, United Kingdom</strong>",1,3.0

All Gallivant staff have been helpful and polite. The rooms are clean with clean towels changed daily with shampoo, conditioner and soap provided. Beds are comfortable with soft fluffy pillows. Breakfast is available in the hotel which we have enjoyed. The location of this hotel cannot be faulted. The negatives- Our standard room is very small. Bathroom is tiny. Room temperature at night has been the main issue. At times it has been too hot at night making it almost impossible to sleep. The window in our room does not open and air con has been a bit hit and miss. If you are planning to spend a lot of time in your hotel room then this may not be the hotel for you. If you want a clean, friendly and perfectly located hotel from which you can explore all that NYC has to offer then I would recommend this hotel.

Our family from Germany flew in to share the holidays with us here. When we arrived and came through the front doors, the lobby was very updated and beautiful. That excitement quickly turned to horror as we entered our room. The most upsetting part is that I am not the only one who complains about these issues; yet the hotel does nothing about the following issues: we had a broken dresser. If we open one drawer, they all opened and then would come off track. We tried to fix them. Did not work. After a closer look-- all furniture looked like rejects from Salvation Army. The photos attached show very worn furniture, however, my photos do not capture how bad the furniture truly was. My husband was going crazy after seeing many exposed wires hanging out throughout the room and no wall outlet plates. Whenever one of us would shower, the water would flood the bathroom. (They did fix this). Also, when one of us showered, there would suddenly be dozens of bugs flying around us and climbing on the walls. The housekeeping staff said it is normal. The bugs come up from the drain. Throughout our room, there was peeling paint, wall holes, wall knicks, broken blinds, and some of our windows did not open correctly. Also, there was missing floor in some areas and in others, the flooring was overlapping one another. We had broken and/or missing baseboards as well. Ok. Ignoring all of the esthetics, it just got worse. We could not even relax to watch TV. The TV does not swivel--it faces the broken desk. To watch the TV, you must sit in the ""one"" old, uncomfortable, breaking desk chair. If more than one person wanted to watch TV, we had to take turns sitting in the ""one"" old, uncomfortable, breaking desk chair. Mind you, we had a Family Room for 5 people. To have to share a chair with 5 people is plain ignorance on the hotel's part. We paid for a large room with 3 beds; yet we could not watch TV at the end of the night and we are paying about $600 a night. This is one of the stupidest decisions I have ever made in my life with regard to wasting money. Because our stay was during the holidays, we were held hostage. There was no where for us to go. It was extremely maddening. We had children. There was no way for us to avoid our room and stay out all night. Also, after 6 hours of walking around every day, we wanted to relax and watch TV as well. How the hell to do this when the TV faces the east wall and our beds are on the north and south walls? Remember, the TV does not swivel. The thought that went into this ""boutique"" hotel were extremely trivial and uneducated. I recommend staying at a chain hotel so that there are standards that must be met or the staff is held accountable.","Menifee, California","Cynthia L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Menifee, California</strong>",18,1.0

Lovely soft clean towels, didn’t use coffee machine would have been nice to have had provision of tea bags as we don’t drink coffee. Great provision of travel adapter we actually went out and bought one before we realised!

Our friends had the penthouse suite with a balcony overlooking the road which was wow factor but we preferred being lower down so could go up and down stairs and didn’t have to rely on lifts although there were 3 of them and pretty quick but our friends felt they had to wait a while to get up and down.One tiny gripe we had to pay residents tax outgoing whilst our Expedia reservation said included all taxes and surcharges and this was taken from our credit card, I would have preferred to have been told that, the cost and the option of paying cash when we checked out instead.Liked the lemon water provided on the desk and the provision of ice machine on our floor and the noon checkout was also great thank you for a lovely stay","Bolton, UK","DebsnMark1967</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bolton, UK</strong>",81,5.0

After spending 10 minutes in line for assistance, the receptionist was totally disrespectful and dishonest with me. I asked for help because I had a reservation with airlink NYC, and since the streets around was closed because new years eve, I needed to know my new pick up point. so I asked the receptionist to call them for me and he just said “I can’t do it, can’t you see the line of people waiting to be assisted?”, I was outrageous since I waited in line FOR TEN MINUTES BEFORE MY TURN. So I tried to explain to him that I had only 5 more minutes before the shuttles departure time, and he just said that after check out, the guest is not the hotels problem anymore and yelled “next guest”, totally left me out talking by myself, I felt embarrassed, mistreated, it was horrible! So I asked him to call the manager, he did. The manager came, and apparently tried to help, but did nothing with the receptionist who humiliated me in front of everybody at the lobby.

On arrival, we were greeted by a beautifully festively decorated & presented lobby. This was then followed by welcoming and friendly hotel staff. We were told on arrival that we had been upgraded which was lovely. We then went up to our room which was on the 9th floor. It was very clean and tidy and much better than most of the reviews I have read. It was also a good size given that you are in New York! I have seen a number of reviews complaining about the lifts, however, we didn’t experience any issues. There was the one morning they were busy but the stairs were easily accessible and it didn’t take longer than a couple of minutes to get down to the lobby. We were very busy on our trip so we didn’t get much time to eat at the hotel, but the restaurant on the side was great to pop in to and have a quick beer and nibble before venturing out for the evening. When it came to the departure, we had to leave the hotel at 4:30am and I was a bit concerned we would struggle to sort getting to the airport and finding a cab. The gentleman on reception that morning was extremely helpful, and called us a cab which arrived straight to our front door. It was really smart and reasonably priced too. The receptionist really did help to make things a lot less stressful that morning, so thank you. The location of this hotel is perfect! Broadway and Times Square are easy to get to within minutes, it was so easy to find somewhere to get dinner in the evening. Apart from the airport runs, we only used one taxi whilst we stayed here and that was to get to the piers - we walked the rest.So take the negative reviews with a pinch of salt, we had a truly magical time in New York and the Gallivant definitely contributed to this.Thank you :-) ","Hartlebury, United Kingdom","victoria_jay2017</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hartlebury, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

Water is only available on the 4th or 7th floor from the ice dispenser, compounding the hot room and lift issues.

The price was almost too good to be true and so we didn't expect much. We travelled to this hotel via subway from JFK (well, you have to take an air train out of the airport first) I think we paid $5 for the journey. It took approximately an hour to get to the hotel this way as you have to change once or twice, but it wasn't too difficult as we didn't have much luggage and the walk from the subway was little over 5 minutes. The hotel itself is very close to Times Square, again, little over a 3-5 minute walk. The view wasn't fantastic, I think we just about caught the side of M&M world, but then, you get what you pay for. The room was a little on the small side, but adequately supplied. We did find that the door caught on the floor when you tried to shut it, and the shower rattled, so we got the overall idea that it was a bit cheap, but then...so was the price. We didn't particularly like that the duvets on the beds didn't have a cover, but they were merely sandwiched between two sheets. This might just be an American thing, but we didn't like it. The rooms, however, were modern and there was very little street noise. Most places were within walking distance of this hotel, with the Empire State taking less than 15 minutes (although we are quick walkers) It was also surrounded by subway stations that led to anywhere that may have taken slightly longer. We didn't have much interaction with staff. We weren't greeted at the hotel, but the man at the check-in desk was pleasant enough. The Wi-Fi is also very good. Overall, we would definitely stay here again. Pros: distance to everything, street noise, modern.Cons: bad bedding, small rooms",,jargonpardon,5,4.0

We have stayed in many of the moderate-priced hotels in the immediate 4-5 blocks of the Gallivant. The Gallivant's location is superb! The beds are very comfortable and things are reasonably clean without being spotless. That said, you must understand that the Gallivant is a converted old welfare hotel with rather dingy hallways, and doors that slam when being shut. This hotel currently seems to cater to large tourist groups, so be prepared to pick your way through a lobby filled with milling people from tour groups and littered in every corner with huge suitcases tied together. The 3 elevators are often slow or in use at the top part of the building. We stayed in 309, and it often was more convenient to walk down. Specific to 309: the view was of the ""tenement"" side of the next door building, but it was delightful to be on the quiet side of the building rather than the noisy street side. If we stay here in the future, I would probably request a room further away from elevators and the morning housekeeping racket. All in all, our stay was pleasant enough, and definitely beautifully located. While I think the price was outrageous for this level of hotel, I also have to admit that I learned the hard way to never come to NYC the first week in December.

The room was really comfortable, small but you’re not their to stay in the room all the time. Now for the bad. I paid extra for breakfast, but unfortunately I ended up eating out every day, the first day was because we had an early tour and breakfast was served until 0700. The other days were because it’s a continental, that’s probably partly my fault as I never read that properly, but I wish I had never paid for the breakfast at all. There was one particular day our room wasn’t cleaned and we had to locate our own towels and take our litter out. There is three lifts in the hotel, and at least two of the days there was only one working lift with queues of people waiting for them, leaving us to walk a couple of times, the day we checked out the lifts were down and we waited for about 20 mins to finally get one down. Lastly, there is an additional charge on top of what you have already paid, I believe it’s about $25 a day. I did know about this, but only because I had done some digging. That being said, I think most hotels in the city charge the same charge. I did have a fantastic holiday and apart from the lift and breakfast, the hotel is good.

We requested a twin room and received an email confirming this from the hotel itself however were given a small double. The hotel dismissed me (politely) asking to change rooms despite me showing the email. We were told we’d have to wait two days for another room to become available. The whole time we were dealt with rudely by the reception staff with one woman exclaiming ‘do what I tell you’ when I asked what we had to do with our cases to switch rooms. The foyer is lovely upon arrival however you soon discover the rooms are not reflective of that. They are small, which is understandable given the location, however I have stayed in other 3* hotels in Times Sq. and The Gallivant has some of the smallest rooms I have seen. Perhaps most disconcerting, though, is the dustiness and general dirtiness of the bedrooms. Both rooms we inhabited were disgusting in terms of dust under the bed, grime and the state of the air conditioning unit. Both my friend and I suffer from asthma and we were both ill the entire duration; something that other guests have also commented on which does not surprise me as the air unit looked ancient and the room constantly had a weird dustiness to the air. There are also too few lifts for the number of guests - we waited over 15 minutes for one one day as they only allow 7 people in each lift and there are just two for the whole hotel.

The lobby is small and can get a bit over crowed at times but this is not an issue as i wasn't there to sit in the lobby. Our room was an average size, clean, warm and the bed was comfy!!! If you are going to New York to stay in your hotel room then this hotel may not be for you as its not 5 star but if you want a comfy room to lay your head after a busy day then this is the place as the location is unbelievable with a 2 minute walk to time square.

Beds were comfortable though. Decor was tasteful. AC did not work in room 1428- which made the room 80 degrees all night- very uncomfortable. Lobby/front desk-nice staffThe lobby was overheated and overcrowded. 2 skinny elevators are inadequate for 15 floors. I think there must’ve been a front desk issue on Dec 7- unhappy people and luggage filled the entire lobby for the entire day. We did not have front desk issues, but it seemed that was not the case for most people, most People could not get into their rooms well after check in time and some got there early. The lounge/computer area looked like it was roped off with chairs still up? There was water available in a dispenser with ice but no cups. The ice machines were broken on most floors, only 4th floor worked. Location-1 block to Times Square- very convenient to everything. Bars/restaurants right next door. Parking- Ritz Icon parking garage directly across the street- $45 per day if you got your ticket stamped. We had no problems parking, but others were lined up the street blowing horns on our checkout day, so not sure what was going on with that, other than it was Saturday? So maybe we were lucky checking in on a Friday and getting out early on Sat? Anyway, for the high price, I would not recommend staying at the Gallivant.

We found this hotel and thought it looked smart and booked it. When we arrived, we were given our key and went to our room where we were not impressed with the size and appearance of the room. First thing was the size as it was very tiny for a couple to stay in and manoeuvre around the bed. Next was the large balcony door that was opposite the bed with a large frosted window that let in too much light. Not to mention that there used to be a blind but looked to be torn off or removed so we were woken up at the early hours by the light. Another thins to note is that this hotel sits on the same road as a fire station, so in the early hours of the night you will get woken up by fire engines. We should have been told about this upon arrival so that this was something to bare in mind. The breakfast in the hotel was mediocre, just a bit over priced for what it was in the hotel when you can go down the street to another place for cheaper and a bigger selection. The location, you can’t fault it. Around the corner from Times Square, the gray line bus tours and walking distance to other attractions. Lastly, I was asked to put a $125 deposit down for the room in case of anything had happened to the room. We left the room tidy and everything to a standard for the cleaners to come and change the sheets etc. I was promised that I would be getting a deposit back in 3-5 days. It has been well over a week, and I haven’t had a single word from the hotel, and no sign of that money. Even contacting them via the website is bad as you will not get a response. Not even a reply from Facebook.Wouldn’t recommend this hotel to be honest.",,rosswhittaker91,0,2.0

This was my first time in New York, I stayed with my friend to celebrate us turning 30! The location was brilliant, really close to Times Square and Rockefeller Centre etc and the lobby was lovely and Christmassy! The check in was really quick and the staff friendly but it took a while to get up to the room as the lifts seem to stop on every floor and are really small. The room was compact but we were out most of the day so it wasn’t a problem. The bathroom was lovely, great shower. And there is coffee in the room, TV and hairdryer etc. Our room seemed really clean and we came back to it having been cleaned each day and fresh towels. The only real issue we had was on organising transport to the airport at the end of our stay. We had asked reception the day before leaving, what the best way to get to JFK was (as we had flown into Newark on the way there). We were assured they could book us a cab no problem, and we didn’t need to book anything in advance as a taxi could be there within 2 minutes. So we spent our last day enjoying the city, but arrived back to the lobby packed with people complaining that their taxis hadn’t arrived! When we asked reception to book us one, they said there are no taxis available, so I explained what we had been told the day before and he told us to go out on the street and hail a cab. Being two girls on our own, on a Friday night with our luggage, we didn’t fancy this! Eventually we spoke to the manager on duty who was really helpful and she managed to get us a car, but it cost us more than we were initially quoted and was an anxious end to our trip. We would have been happy to get the train, but as reception had told us it was so easy for them to get us a cab we didn’t look into other transport options! Apart from this, and the slow lifts, it was a great, clean and comfortable place to stay right in the centre of town.

The hotel is relatively clean and basic, but it is in need of major investment, an uplift in facilities and a overhaul of the front of house staff.The positives first - The basic rooms are clean and kept tidy by hard working house keeping staff. The lobby is spacious and makes for a nice entrance, however that's where the positives end.The negatives - The heater in our room was broken and blowing cold air until we managed to get staff to fix it after a long argument over it supposedly taking time for the 'old building to heat up'. The water supply is cold in an evening and takes 10 mins to actually warm up prior to being able to take a shower. The lifts are tiny, overused and so it takes 10 mins for one to arrive on the relevant level. Whatsmore, when we tried the stairway it was apparently blocked for painting work even though it is meant to be a functioning fire exit. On check out the concierge, who we asked to book a ride to the airport was the least helpful man in the U.S, rude and unhelpful.

The room (even in December) was extremely warm, and the air conditioning unit in order to have it up high enough to make any difference was extremely loud. It was a choice between sleeping or being cool at times! I was disappointed on our final night that some sort of maintenance work was being done at 7am right outside our room - I'd expect a hotel to appreciate people might have been up late, or perhaps be sleeping after travelling and to perhaps start at a more reasonable hour.

To add breakfast for 2 people for 4 nights cost an extra £189 so I thought rather than go out searching for a restaurant in the morning It would be more convenient to eat in the hotel and head out from there. I was given coupons from reception which I had to hand in to the restaurant before breakfast. the first morning I handed in our coupons only to be told that I was only entitled to a continental breakfast. I explained that I had pre paid for breakfast and was expecting a full breakfast. Waitress explained that in order to get a full Breakfast I would need to pay another $10 per day. Without wanting to cause too much of a scene I gave her $10 and found a table. To my surprise the full breakfast was a few tiny sausages. scraps of Bacon and cold scrambled Egg. The following day we just had continental. on the final morning I was eating my Breakfast, and I was interrupted by the waitress who asked me why I had got cheese. Bearing in mind the cheese was 2 slices placed on a saucer and wrapped in cling film. I said I was just having the continental Breakfast. She then told me that the cheese was not included in the continental Breakfast and then took it away from me and put it back on the Breakfast bar. I found this very embarrassing and confusing. To me a continental breakfast always included Cheese/Ham/ Bread etc. The breakfast is very limited at the hotel but to be honest I never went hungry. However you can opt to pay for breakfast at the hotel which would have been a lot cheaper than what I paid. Moaning aside. I thought the hotel was fine. the rooms were small but clean and adequate to be honest. could not fault the location as its right In the heart of times square. Would I go back? Probably, but I would not use the restaurant for breakfast as it just wasn't value for money and the staff have really put me off with their unprofessionalism.","Durham, United Kingdom","Jaynshaz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Durham, United Kingdom</strong>",3,3.0

We were allocated a room on the 15th floor which had 2 double beds, 1 had disgusting stains around the base cover and the other was sagging in the middle. The radiator cover was cracked and looked filthy and the sofa cover was stained with goodness know what. I couldn’t have slept in that room as it looked filthy on first inspection so I wasn’t taking the chance on what may have been lurking on the mattress! When we asked if we could change rooms the guy on reception actually sniggered and said there was none available. The duty manager eventually sorted things out by issuing a full refund so we could be on our way and find another hotel. To top it all the lift doors stuck on the 15th floor when we went back up to the room to get our cases so we had to press the floor below to get out! The reception staff need customer service training and you don’t pay good money to be patronised or made to feel you’ve done something wrong by refusing to stay in a filthy room.We were asked to email the duty manager with our complaint which we have done. The hotel has not responded to our email, but yet we have since had 3 emails from the hotel ‘thanking us for our stay’ and asking us to leave a review!Don’t waste your money the hotel is not cheap and there are other great quality hotels with well trained staff nearby - as we found out!","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","SCF69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",32,1.0

Glad I didn’t. Stayed 5 nights. The reception was clean and modern and decorated for Christmas, the staff were welcoming. Check in was easy and the room was ready early- 2 hours before their stated check in time. The lifts were slower than some but on 11 out of the 12 times used it wasn’t a problem. Didn’t eat here so can’t comment on food. Coffee pods in the room was good but the powdered creamer was disgusting so get some fresh milk! Our room was on the 12th floor and must have been refurbished as it had a modern contemporary feel to it. Spacious room with en-suite shower room. Large walk in shower. Miniature bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body lotion- no shower gel but I’d seen the reviews so taken my own. Towels were replaced every day and were only bath towel size rather than bath sheet size , but there were hand towels too. Personally would prefer a larger towel! The room was very warm and the air con was noisy and unit didn’t look the cleanest so didn’t want to keep it on in case it was harbouring germs. The windows were probably over due for replacement, we left ours open a fraction and you could hear street noise but we were in Times Square and you soon blocked the traffic noise out. The bed was comfortable, sheets replaced every day, it was an average double, but not complaining like others have. TV had poor reception but I wasn’t there to stay in and watch TV. Standard things in the room were there, safe , hairdryer, iron and ironing board. Overall a very good hotel experience. Clean and comfortable. Check out swift and the bag storage was $2 per bag for the day. Location was fabulous. New York brilliant.

Check my in was fast and easy. The room was clean and comfortable as well. The street noise at night was sometimes very loud but this is expected considering it is so close to Times Square. Location is the best as most of the tourist attractions are in walking distance. We were mostly only in our room when we finished a long day in the city and were ready for bed so it was perfect for us. ,,Sightsee45928779923,0,4.0

On arrival we were disappointed from the welcome for the reception staff, there was no bellhop and we were handed 3 bottles of water to carry (along with all of our luggage) to the room.On inspection of the room the sofa cover was filthy - deep stains and looked very unhygienic, the radiator cover was broken & looked dirty, the bed cover/dressing was marked and stained. I didn’t even venture into the bathroom. We asked reception if we could move but quite frankly they were uninterested just kind of sniggered when I asked if that was the best room available and then said they would call the manager to sort it out. After persuasion the duty manager did process a full refund as the hotel was fully booked however it spoiled our initial arrival and especially the parting words from reception saying ‘have a great birthday & don’t let this spoil things for you - start afresh tomorrow in a new hotel’ beyond belief! We were asked to email pictures to the duty manager which we did but have not even received a courtesy email back! We have since received an email from the manager asking us to ‘rate our stay’ hence this review!","Fethiye, Turkey","jamie_fisher</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fethiye, Turkey</strong>",16,1.0

Prior to arriving I had emailed the hotel saying it was my mums birthday. On arrival, they had sorted out a bottle of wine, balloon and card for her. It was a lovely touch! The desk staff were very knowledgeable and recommended places to eat. We had a family room on the 12th floor and it was amazing. Very spacious and comfortably slept 4 adults. As other reviewers have mentioned, the lift is slow however it’s not that much of an inconvenience and you can always go down the stairs if you’re in a rush. We didn’t have breakfast in the attached restaurant but we did have an evening meal and it was lovely. The hotel is very well located within a few minutes walk to Times Square. I would definitely recommend and would happily stay here again.

Rooms are super small with horrible lighting even in the bathroom and the hallways were extremely hot. Really long waits for an elevator because only one worked most of our stay. The ice machine was out of order on our floor and the 10th floor room was being used as storage, so I had to go to the 7th floor for ice which wasn't convenient since the elevators didn't work. Staff was friendly and especially the housekeeping lady on the 15th floor. I understand that room size can't be changed, but lighting, climate control, ice machines and elevators can and should be.
