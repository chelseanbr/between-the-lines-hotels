The front desk upgraded us to a room with an amazing skyline view and couldn't be more accomodating. We were so happy, in fact, that we extended our stay for an additional night. Kudos to the front desk staff who were extremely helpful and asking if we needed anything any time we were in the lobby. Much gratitude to the cleaning staff and housekeeping staff who kept the building immaculate and also provided extra towels and pillows. If you find yourself in NYC, this hotel is a real treat. The view from our room (1604) is nothing short of amazing. NYC is going through some trying times and Chinatown has been hit especially hard.

He is disabled so I was looking for a hotel close to Little Italy and Chinatown. I originally booked the ""special offer"" for the room and parking on the hotel website which reads, ""Parking in New York City is no problem with our special travel package. Enjoy a stay in our plush accommodations with an upgrade to Deluxe Queen Empire View room (when available), a $15 credit to Grab and Go, and complimentary valet parking right here at our downtown Manhattan hotel. What could be easier? Package is based on availability, and black out dates may apply. Standard hotel cancellation and deposit policy apply."" My husband decided we should take the train instead. When we got to the hotel I asked them to honor the day's prevailing room rate of $284.00 because we did not drive and I was not going to use their parking. They said they did not see the parking on the room and they could not accommodate my request. They DID NOT give me the $15 credit to ""Grab and Go."" All they gave me the manager's business card so I could try to contact him after the stay. They were not ""helpful"" at all. The room was not what I would consider a ""Deluxe Empire Queen Room;"" there was barely enough room to turn around in it. My final charge for just the room was $427.56 for one night; $369.55 was the room fee plus tax. I don't think I will be going to New York City again any time soon.

Within a few hours of our first night on this trip, our smoke alarm went off. I called the front desk multiple times with no luck. A 'Hotel Engineer' came up, peeked his head in, and said hold on. Another 10 minutes past with the blaring, ear deafening alarm. Another hotel service person came up, and tried to radio it off remotely with someone at a panel on another floor. The panel was ""too far"" away someone yelled on the walkie talkie. Another 10 minutes of the ear piercing alarm went off, the man returned, pried the alarm off the wall (not a typical battery smoke alarm, but one of the large dome shaped official city alarms), and did something with a screw driver to turn it off. We were told taking a hot shower caused it to go off as the bathroom fan relies on a natural roof exhaust (not a motor fan). We were instructed to shower with low heat showers and to keep our hotel door open when we showered going forward? I can't think of a more vulnerable way and place to shower. The front desk never followed up, apologized or offered any form of a coherent explanation as to why the deafening loud alarm went off for 20 minutes. It may have even been a fire alarm or carbon monoxide detector, but we didn't die so I guess it was neither. The service here is poor. It has been sort of average in the past and I was always willing to overlook that for the price and room cleanliness, but when we are talking about emergency indicators and consistently grumpy personnel, I had to speak up. Additionally, because of the Beer Garden and Ramen Bar on the first floor, there is now an ottoman sized cologne diffuser in the lobby which is bordering on intoxicating in how strongly perfumed and repulsive the scent it fills the lobby with. I imagine this diffuser is to the mask the smells of the two eateries, which it does successfully, but with the price of wanting to pinch your nose in the lobby.We also saw an old lady struggle to pass through the main glass revolving lobby door with her rolling luggage as the side doors instruct you to always use the revolving door. She kept getting stuck, waved for help to the woman at the front desk and who responded by rolling her eyes, remaining at her station and yelling ""Thats why I told you to use the door!"".

Shinka, the ramen restaurant downstairs and the rooftop bar are both worth a visit. Shinka is a great spot even for us locals. The location is excellent, close to many great restaurants and neighborhoods in Lower Manhattan.Cons: We checked in at 9:30pm or so and went into our room. We couldn’t find the lights. Went back downstairs on the super slow elevators and the front desk member told us how to turn them on. Not intuitive at all. Why would you put a dark brown light switch plate on a brown wall that allows you to then turn on the switch to the lights that are in the middle of the room? The tiny hallway light barely lit up the entrance way, let alone the sleeping quarters where this secret switch is located. It wasn’t even a master switch because turning the switch off did not turn off all the other lights in the room when we were ready for bed.While unpacking, I stepped on a mystery liquid in my socks on the dark brown carpet that turned my white socks yellow. The carpet between the two double beds had a big wet spot that clearly did not dry out even though we had the windows open for several hours while we went out. The smell permeating from the spot smelled like moss or mold or something growing underneath the carpet. We laid a towel over it just so we could get into bed since we wanted to take a shower and sleep after a long day.The shower control was difficult to use. We are frequent world travelers and have stayed in hundreds of hotels, and we have never had to call someone up to show us how to work the shower. Not even in the Amazon rainforest! The front desk member I called agreed the showers are tricky in this hotel. There’s always a first for every traveler, I suppose.The glass door of the shower is useless at keeping the water from getting all over the bathroom. Everything ends up wet after you shower. Again, the moldy smell emanated from the shower drain. Coincidentally, the shower wall abuts the beds...My husband, usually with a high tolerance for this kind of stuff, suggested that we Uber home after our showers. He did not want to deal with any more issues for a room that we paid a pretty penny for. We checked in at around 9:30pm and he wanted to leave at midnight. That’s how bad it was.We left the windows open all night even though the garbage trucks and police cars were loud on the street. However, the smell did not abate. We left in a hurry around 8am, informed the front desk of the problem, was promised that the manager would contact us when he or she arrived for work today, and it’s now almost midnight. I held this review in draft mode until the end of the day to give management a chance to rectify the situation before I posted. We will not be back and will not be recommending this hotel to families or friends in the near future.","New York City, New York","tracycnyc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",5,1.0

Room is light most of the night and of course worse first thing in the morning as the currents are not thick enough. The bathroom door is frosted glass, so since there is a window in the bathroom, that also lets in a ridiculous amount of light. The bathroom shower has only half glass, so the bathroom gets flooded.I asked the front desk to have someone check the A/C as the temperature only went up from the time I first got into the room til about 3 hours later. I was told someone would fix it. Went out for a couple of hours. Upon return, front desk said it was fixed. She never actually confirmed it was fixed as no one had been in my room. Temp had gone up 3 more degrees while I was out. Perhaps check for accurate info before lying to guests.Last day of 2, a strong smell of marijuana has been coming through the A/C vent.

We didn’t stay too much in the hotel as we were exploring NYC for which the location is absolutely perfect. It’s on the edge of the Chinatown one block from Little Italy and less than 5 mins walk to the nearest subway (Grand Street Station). We pretty much walked everywhere in the Lower Manhattan from here. It’s also in a great proximity to Brooklyn Bridge so you can simply walk straight from the hotel.The rooms was clean with enough space. Even though it is on a corner of a very busy street and they were doing some reconstruction on the hotel building it was very quiet in the room. The service was excellent, really can’t complain about anything.There is a great rooftop bar with nice views up to Empire State Building. Definitely recommend to come and check even if you don’t stay in this hotel. There is also some bar downstairs and if you are after a great food then there is Little Italy with many Italian restaurants or walk up to NOHO for other options (Tip for Australians if you are after a great coffee - there is an Australian cafe Two Hands on 164 Mott St).How to get from and to airports:We arrived at the Newark International Airport and with a shuttle bus (we were the last one the dropped off) it took 1,5 hours. That’s not great but it was a morning busy traffic so I assume that’s fairly normal. When we were leaving NYC we took subway to Jamaica Station and then AirTrain to the JFK Airport which took over an hour but it was much cheaper then the shuttle bus and no extra discomfort (no need to walk little bit from the Jamaica subway station to the AirTrain station, I would say around 5 mins walk.) We simply wanted to avoid the unpredictable traffic when using shuttle, cab or Uber so that’s mainly why we decided to use this option.SummaryI would definitely recommend staying in this hotel for anyone who comes to visit and explore NYC.

The bathroom was also newly updated and we slept great in the queen bed. We also took advantage of the rooftop bar and the beer garden on the main level. Both were great options to end the day and relax together with a good beer. This hotel is a great location with easy access to uptown and downtown trains.

Never had a bad experience here and hope we never do. Some of the comments may be seem overly detailed but may help you get a better picture of the property:Shower – plenty of hot water, great water pressure, tile area clean, at least 3 towels. Perfect. (No shower door so the floor gets wet...go figure.)Room – average size for NYC although some (corner rooms) may be a bit bigger, always clean and modern décor. Small fridge without the pay-as-you go minibar. Heard nothing from other rooms.WiFi - works well although you do have to keep entering the password when you leave the area and return. No biggie.Entrance – quite busty and it’s hard to pull up out front, especially if you are coming south on Bowery or coming off of Canal Street. My advice is to park at T&K parking ($40) on Chrystie just around the corner and walk the half block or so to the front door.Location – At the edge of Chinatown and 3 blocks to Little Italy, so it’s busy on the street and the sidewalks. Five minute walk to the Lower East Side.Staff – A BIG 10 for the staff. Every single person we encountered was friendly and helpful. Servers were attentive, housekeeping friendly and the maintenance guys were polite. Front desk was always manned by a friendly and helpful person, no matter what time of day or night.BAR – The Rooftop 93 bar is absolutely great. Wonderful views and well-made cocktails. This is a bar manager that TV's John Taffer (“Bar Rescue”) would be proud of!TIP: My tip is to call the hotel directly to check on the best rates and availability, especially if you’re a repeat visitor.NOTE: There is a major construction project going on to replace windows in the hotel (July 2018) but we were not interrupted in the least by the work. There is scaffolding around the building but it shouldn’t affect your stay.The only downsides we found were: 1). a lack of neighborhood restaurants that were not Chinese (snails? really???). But the food at the Bowery Beer Garden (connected to the hotel) was excellent (burgers!). We did not try the restaurant in the basement (Mr. Wu’s). It's a short walk to the LES and Little Italy where there are many options. 2). The A/C was a pain in the butt and required a visit from the polite maintenance staff to get it cranking after 2 days. In all fairness, this was during the July heat wave, but that made it even harder to get comfortable. In the end it worked fine.Bottom line, this is a well-run, well-managed, clean, affordable choice for your NYC visit.","Drums, PA USA","OLDFLD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Drums, PA USA</strong>",19,5.0

Otherwise, I would normally opt for a Marriott properly.I drove in and the hotel is easy to find using GPS. First thought upon finding the hotel is where is the valet? I read from other reviews that you could do valet (which I wasnt planning on doing) but I was really looking for a place to be safe to unload. Well you do it on the street; there is a sign that says loading area and its about the length of 3 cars in front of the hotel. The good thing is that if you are unloading, the front desk says you are okay to leave your car there for a bit ; you wont get ticketed or towed. What didn't like about the front entrance is that its stairs only. If you have heavy luggage you are not going to have fun, and there are no special needs entrances that I could see. Then its just a revolving door to enter, so my thought is how limited the entrance is. So l grabbed our stuff, checked in, went to the room, yada yada, and came back to move the car. From other reviews I read about using the local parking garage a block over for cheap instead of the hotel $60 valet (didn't even see a valet person around). I already booked on spot hero for $25 overnight parking so dropped the car off and its 3 minute walk back to hotel. Since I never stayed at a Wyndham, I was surprised when they front desk upgraded us to a high corner room on the 10th floor (especially since I paid next to nothing from the room). Front desk staff was extremely friendly, and I saw this outside of the fact that they upgraded my room. Corner room has some nice view of the city; empire state building one way, world trade tower 1 the other. You are facing the street so you will get some noise obviously, but nothing too bad. I definitely enjoyed the size and layout of our small but cozy room (small in nyc is normal); great views from both sides of the room, and bathroom. The bathroom has a full window facing the street. Bathroom was modern, updated, and clean. I am not a fan of the European shower thing with just half a glass window, and water goes everywhere outside the shower, but the water heat and pressure were good. Bed and pillows were very comfortable, but only had a night stand on one side of the bed, so I had to put my phone (aka alarm clock) on the top of the bed post. Room had a nice sized desk, fridge, free bottle of poland spring water, standing upright closet (instead of built into the wall), LCD TV hanging from the ceiling, modern alarm clock with usb charger. I was definitely happy with the room itself, and my fiance slept like a champ. Couldn't test the hotel wireless; saw the network and its asked for a password, but I don't think it was included with out stay. I had great cell coverage anyway so not an issue.Therein are my two annoyances with my stay: I found I could not sleep good because the AC duct is right over the bed, and the sound and way it blew over me made it difficult to sleep comfortably. This is ymmv as the layout will change be room but this was very frustrating as the point of a hotel is to get a good night's sleep. Second thing that frustrated me was the amount of light coming into the room in the morning. This is the result of the the bathroom that I initially really liked. It has a swinging glass door that is translucent. Its really nice looking, but even if you close the bathroom shade and the door, you are going to get a good amount of light coming into the room in the morning. So I blacked out the rest of the room, but the light from the bathroom is full force in the morning, and it makes the light in the room too bright.Other points noting; there is a rooftop bar on 18th floor but can't comment on that. Also a bar/restaurant basically built into the hotel at the entrance. There are some other restaurants/bars in the hotel but didn't make it to any of them so cannot comment. You are however in Chinatown so a lot of good restaurants in walking distance. We walked about 3-4 blocks to Little Italy and had some of the best pizza ever around 11pm -- ahhh!

We were not expecting much, just a decent room to stay in and that's what we got. So far so good.If I don't book a Hilton I don't need a lot of service and don't care much for it, however I am sad to say the opposite of service was what we received. On the last day we wanted to check out at 10 (noon checkout available) and leave our bags behind until 1.30pm. The lady behind the counter wanted $3 per bag - odd and this wasn't charged when we arrived and left our bags until check in. As we had three bags the grand total was $9. I didn't want to kick up a fuss and just accepted it, reached for the wallet and pulled out a $20. The lady mentioned that she didn't have change and that was it. I expected her to get some from the bar in the foryer but nothing, she wanted to charge it to the card. As I had cash left and didn't want to exchange $20 I said $10 will do. The response was that she only had large bills. I think the charge in the first place is poor service and if a small arbitrary charge is raised that is uncommon and not mentioned anywhere, change should be on hand.Beyond that throughout the stay, the staff was not visible or welcoming, just neutral.The lift buttons and card reader didn't work - we stayed on the fifth floor and had to press the up button to get a lift to the lobby. Tough luck if someone on an above floor called the lift as well. You'll have to go up first. One of the two lifts didn't have a function card reader which meant anyone could go to the guest rooms. This happened multiple times when a questionably looking fella just strolled in and followed us to the room or didn't know where he was going.While the room was good the soundproofing was not, we heard taxis and cars honking frequently. We were on the fifth floor.Don't look out for signage at the entrance. It is a construction site with scaffolding, however nobody actually works there. If you have heavy luggage think again, there are some stairs at the entrance and no ramp etc.The location is alright but then again, unless you're keen on a Chinatown and walking past smelly fish on the way to the train station this light be a bit of a negative.The advertised rate on their website was $319 for the night, we got it for $120 - it wouldn't be worth much more than that.","Brisbane, Australia","Michael81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",48,3.0

When we arrived at 9pm we checked in without issue but when we got to the room there was only one double bed, I was staying with my 21 year old son. (I'm a 45 year old man). I thought it would be a simple case of going back downstairs and getting an alternative room. When I booked I was asked how many room and for how many adults, I asked for 1 room for 2 adults but stipulated that I required separate beds. To cut a long story short the receptionist said that she couldn't help and that the special requests box is only acted upon if possible. During our discussion about the situation the phone rang on the desk, the receptionist ignored me and picked up the phone. At this point I decided that after all the travelling I'd walk away and chat to the manager in the morning. The reason why, even in these extreme circumstances, I couldn't share a double with my son is that he suffers from severe eczema and tosses and turns all night scratching himself so badly that he's in constant pain and doesn't sleep well at all. I had to sleep on the floor using the spare pillows and the runner off the bottom of the bed! In the morning I asked a reception for either a roll away bed, a camp bed or even an extra duvet to put on the floor, they couldn't even do that. The whole time they pointed out that it was my fault for booking the wrong room. I spent 3 nights on the floor despite asking morning and night for something, anything, better than sleeping on the floor with the bed decoration! This was my first visit to the states and as a serving British Army soldier I'd been told that US customer service was second to none. Sadly, nothing could be further from the truth, I couldn't even get a spare duvet!Never again to this hotel or the booking agent Otel who have refused to even call me to discuss my complaint. I'm almost 100% sure that I wasn't given the opportunity to state twin beds before I got to the comments box but even if I did you'd think that the hotel would at least give me a spare duvet.

The stay here was comparable to a nicer motel at best. First off, the front desk messed up our reservation, which seems extremely common with this hotel. We had 3 people in our group and had booked a room for a king size bed + queen size bed. Instead they said that room was unavailable and had given us a smaller room with 2 queen beds. Front desk staff failed to clearly explain why the room was unavailable. However, after venting my dissatisfaction, an ""upgrade"" was offered. We were given a larger suite with just a king bed, with an option for a roll out bed for the 3rd guest. Larger room was a plus, but 3 nights on their springy roll out bed is not recommended unless you're under the age of 10.Not a full service hotel. No concierge, no room service, front desk personnel is just okay, but not helpful. Asked the front desk for an estimated taxi fare to JFK airport, and they didn't know and told me to just take an Uber. Seriously? Did not even offer to help when we were in the lobby clearly having trouble with our 4+ pieces of luggage at 5am.The good: Hotel location is great if you want to get away from the city. It's situated in Chinatown and is easily accessible to the subway. Lots of great affordable restaurants nearby, but bring cash.

My son handled the booking and I really don’t know what happened but we ended up with a queen bed instead of two double beds. Upon check-in, they would not switch the room for us, but were very accommodating by allowing the use of a rollaway bed for the mere cost of $30 a night. (I’ve paid extra before for a rollaway but never $30 a night.) The room was extremely small to begin with and then throw a rollaway in. Shower did not work very well at all for the first two days. They had to install a new shower head. Not once did they replace the toiletries in the room. I accidentally spilled some soda on the comforter and they never bothered to replace it with a fresh one our entire stay. Never did restock the coffee that was in the room the first day. A couple of days we weren’t sure the room had been cleaned because the bed and rollaway were made very haphazardly. Staff was nice enough at check-in, but basically ignored us the rest of our stay.

And that the public will come in at night to use the elevator to get up to the rooftop. I did not feel unsafe at any point mind you. Again, thought this was relevant to let people know.

This is not our first visit to New York and we wanted something different to the tourist trap of Times Square. The area on first glance is ok but nothing special, Bowery is the edge of chinatown so you don't get the ""watches, watches, bags bags"" while on the road itself as soon as you're off the road the area leaves a lot to be desired and I would suggest only breathing through your mouth especially on a morning! There were discarded pigs legs, fish and rubbish strewn in the road right outside to hotel! There's a subway station a couple of minutes away though which is good. The hotel checked us in quickly and we went up to our room on the second floor. This floor has a balcony outside the glass door in the room which is shared with all other floors so you can't open your curtains as there's always someone strolling by! The door had some tape on the edge of it I assume this was to stop the draft coming in but it didn't work as it was freezing on a night on that side of the bed. The room is a good size and has a fridge, large tv and coffee making facilities. The bathroom is good too but the fact you can see others showering when in the bedroom is massively offputting - perfect for a peeping tom! The shower was hot and powerful but the fixings were loose and the shower tray rusting, the shower also makes a screaming noise when running which I'm sure our neighbours didn't appreciate at 6am (we were in room 204 if you want to look at fixing that). The housekeeper did a great job of keeping the place clean and tidy, the main problem I had is that whenever we were in the room we were getting bitten by something which was leaving large red lumps on our arms, legs and bodies, we never saw what was causing it but it was definitely only when in the room. The rooftop bar has amazing views BUT the music is too loud, like ridiculously so. So much that you genuinely can't hear the person sat next to you and it stopped us going up again after the second visit. The bar underneath is also very loud - I'm writing this draft while on night 4 of the 5 night stay and I genuinely cannot sleep due to the noise from downstairs and the noise from the road too, I'm dreading tomorrow as it's our last night and we need to be up at 3am for the airport. The lifts are also just full of people going up to floor 18 making it harder to get to your room. Also, we asked the receptionist where we could buy some water for the room and we're sent into the hotel shop where we got charged $4 for a small bottle. The Hong Kong supermarket over the road do a large bottle for under $2. In summary - I'm genuinely confused as to what this hotel is aiming itself at as it seems nice but the uncomfortably loud music and number of visitors who don't seem to be staying in the hotel are stopping us enjoying the hotel for what we booked it for - relaxing and sleeping. That, coupled with the bites from whatever is feasting on us mean that on our next visit to New York we wouldn't consider this hotel again which is a shame as it could offer guests so much more by way of being a hotel rather than a nightclub. It was difficult to choose between 2 and 3 out of 5 for this hotel but I went for 3 as the description of 'average' is about right for what is on offer as a hotel meant for sleeping in and relaxing in.

Decided to check out lower Manhattan this time. This hotel is decent. We all know NYC is terribly expensive, noisy, dirty and crowded. I wanted more cultural experiences rather than the time square/disney experience. Chinatown is perfect, steps from Little Italy and Soho. Arrival at the hotel was shaky. Was stuck in the elevator, because the button to 10th fl was stuck and had to go to 11th fl. and walk down. Rescued by a security guard. I avoided that elevator on the return.Key didn’t always work for 1st, 2nd try in the other elevator either. it's midnight and I'm hungry. NO room service but Highland Deli delivers. Got a burger and fries. Good flavor however, no salt or ketchup provided so everything was a dry, dry, dry. Make sure you request it if you order.My room is good., nice view, small and clean(mostly) something weird on my sheets. NO counter space for my cosmetics in the bathroom, that’s a HUGE pain. Put some of my things on the toilet seat to get dressed. The mattress is encased and therefore bedbugs are not an issue.:-)The closet is a problem too. it's a half closet and my clothes can’t hang without hitting the bottom and getting wrinkled. So I use the Bathroom hook. Why the bar is so low I don’t understand. No dresser drawers either.No tub in 1001, but good city view. The shower has a weird design, only half a glass and the water spills onto the floor under the sink after showering. So the floor is wet, not great while you are trying to get dressed.Fridge works, but it’s not turned on, you must open the door and dial the number up before it gets cold..Windows don’t open. Small rooftop lounge for drinks. Cosy restaurant below, but it was closed.You have to pay $3.50/bag after you check out and want them to hold your bags☹ Also, 1st water in your room is free, then they charge $3.00/bottle afterwards.

There are some pluses, (floor to ceiling windows that provide a nice view, decent bar adjacent to hotel, fairly close to subway) but on my most recent stay (I've stayed here before) the air conditioning was not working. It was 95 degrees in NYC and the only thing you want after walking around in that kind of heat is to come back to a cool room to rest. It was awful - even the bedding was damp from the humidity. The front desk clerk who came up to check it (not even maintenance - the front desk clerk!) said maybe it was because the blinds were open. Um, it's midnight and the sun has been down for about 4 hours and the room is the size of a small closet, so I think if the temp in the room has gone UP since we arrived and set it at 68, it's probably not because the blinds were open. Then he tried to tell us it takes a little time for it to cool down. Like 8 hours?? No, not buying that. I asked to be moved and he said they were sold out. He offered a fan, which we accepted, however it did not do much to cool down the room. So we were not able to sleep much, which is really what we were paying for. On a separate issue, I asked at check in to change the credit card the room was booked under and the front desk clerk (same one from earlier) said he took care of it, but NOPE, he didn't. Vanessa, the morning front desk clerk was fantastic in helping to clear that up, and provided us with a late checkout which was much appreciated.","Mullica Hill, New Jersey","mrszuhwiggins</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mullica Hill, New Jersey</strong>",11,3.0

The beds are just right; not too firm or soft, and the pillows are soft. But the room needs more chairs and the a/c vent and system need to be reevaluated. The bathroom is different than the rest of the room and fits in with the expectations that one has of a glass and steel building. But the bathroom needs more than one hanger and lacks towel rods/hangers. Despite the eco-friendly offer to let guests reuse towels, the hotel doesn't provide any means for guests to hang wet towels to dry out. Granted that given the size of the bathroom, it may be a design challenge but nevertheless, this needs consideration.The room door warps in the door frame.

We chose the China Town area as it was better located for the sights we wanted to visit on this occasion.

The hotel itself was perfectly nice, we didn't have breakfast included do can't comment on that but reception staff were always available and although not overly friendly, perfectly polite and helpful.The gym was basic but although I used it each morning I never shared it with anyone! Plenty of towels and cold water down there, also a daily paper on the counter.There is a rooftop bar (one of our reasons for booking here) but we discovered it is NOT affiliated with the hotel and is actually quite a dump (see separate review). In my opinion Wyndham Garden would do well to completely disassociate themselves from it.The hotel is located on a very busy crossroads and I was concerned before we arrived about noise. Our room had floor to ceiling glass looking out over the main road and was very noisy- that would be our main criticism. I don't know if any rooms were less noisy but on the 5th floor the traffic, sirens, horns and traffic cop whistles were irritating to say the least, preventing us from getting proper sleep. The room itself was furnished to a good standard with a comfortable bed, large TV and basic coffee making facilities. The bathroom lacked thought though. The shower screen was attractive but not sufficient to prevent the rest of the bathroom (including loo rolls) from getting soaked.

Clean hotel but the rooms are tiny, to the point wear you have to climb over suitcases to get to the bathroom. We had second floor room looking at a brick wall. The sliding doors to the outside leaked noise and the wind whistled through the night. I asked to move rooms as I had emailed them twice requesting a nice room (it was a surprise trip for my boyfriends 30th birthday) I never got a reply. When I asked to move rooms I was told there would be a charge. Having already paid for my room I wasn't prepared to pay anymore. Shower is poor just spits the water out and floods the bathroom.Lovely rooftop bar on the 18th floor with amazing views at night, opens at 5pm. Even though we had been there all week we were asked for id on the last evening. Bar food is nice (only ate on first night as we were too tired to go out). Nice big portions. Nice friendly staff.One other issue I have, I was asked to leave my debit card details, which I did as I thought this was standard procedure. Only to find out from my bank yesterday they debited $40 from my account FOR NO REASON. I will be contacting them when my statement comes trough. The hotel was all paid for as a package through British Airways. I should not have been charged anything.Don't give your card details. In terms of location - I would stay downtown again. Apart from the one day when we visited the 9/11 memorial, statue of liberty and Brooklyn Bridge we spent the rest of time around central park and times square. So next time I will stay up that end.

I was in town for a solo vacation.What I Liked:1. The location. I wanted to stay in a part of the city that was not extremely touristy and this hotel is ideal if you want that type of experience or if you just specifically want to stay in the heart of Chinatown.2. They really maximize the city views with floor to ceiling windows in the rooms.3. The free WiFi in the rooms is easy to connect to and works great.4. You are within 3-4 blocks of multiple subway stops.5. The heat, bed, pillows, everything was on point and comfortable.What I Didn't Like:1. The bathroom. I didn't like it so much I am knocking a whole star off the review because of it. Despite being a very spacious bathroom, it is just not designed very well. The huge walk in shower has no ""traditional"" shower head and just a handheld sprayer on a sort-of adjustable arm. So you either need the sprayer always in one hand or have to somehow position it on that adjustable arm just so. Plus the water pressure was lame.Also, despite having plenty of room, there is literally no counter space in the bathroom at all. Luckily my Dopp kit is in a hangable bag, but if I didn't have that I have no idea where I would have put my stuff.The bathroom aside, I enjoyed the property and had a wonderful trip to the city. I am not in the hotel room all that much when in NYC, so if the place is clean and the bed is comfy I am pretty easy to please.

Our hotel room on the second floor was so cold it was hard to sleep, and the hotel staff were not helpful. I had turned the thermostat to the mid to high 70s, but this changed nothing. I called the front desk asking if there was anything they could do about how cold the room was, and the man came to our room, turned the thermostat temperature to 90 (the maximum) and said that was all he could do. The thermostat might as well have been a decoration on the wall because it simply did nothing. It did not work, and the room remained extremely cold. I called them again and said that the hotel heating system must be broken for this room as the thermostat does not work, and asked if I could be moved to a different room on a different floor. I was told that there were no other rooms available that night, and that there was nothing they could do. Frankly, I don't believe this, we were staying during a very quiet time and it's likely they had nicer rooms on higher floors available but simply refused to move us even though our room's heating was broken.This supposedly 4-star hotel in New York city costing $200+ per night had a broken heating system and they did nothing about it, and they refused to even have us move rooms. I don't know how they can think this is remotely acceptable.Personally, I will never stay at a Wyndham again. I had even called their customer support after the stay, and they never got back to me.

Round the corner near Manhatten bridge is a dunkin donuts for anyone wanting a quick breakfast, also along Canal St there is a 7/11 which is good to get snacks.There are so many restaurants nearby but we were on a schedule with family that we only ate at one of the Chinese restaurants nearby, I wish we had had more time to eat there again.I would not chose another hotel as I felt this hotel offered all that you needed plus it was in an amazing location that would show a new visitor more than being in Times Square.The hotel also have a fantastic roof top bar which we only visited once which i regret as the view was to die for!","Hessle, United Kingdom","minilouise75</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hessle, United Kingdom</strong>",43,5.0

For those driving in (and leaving your car overnight) the valet drop-off is nearly non-existent during peak times - nothing is clearly marked; it's simply a parking spot on the corner of Bowery. Your car will then be driven to a satellite parking lot (my car was unscathed so no complaint there). The front desk upon my arrival was super helpful but I was surprised to see that she was the only staff (they could use more). The elevators during this time were pretty slow and reduced to only one operating - wait time matters when you're trying to get some rest. Thankfully there's a lot of good food and shopping within walking distance. The centrality of the location is great for convenience but not the best parameter for restful sleep. The showers in this place are kind of weird as they are separated by a half wall. There are great views of Manhattan available in the hotel's terrace bar. The bartender was kind enough to escort us to the empty deck on an overcast evening - do note that there was a two-drink minimum to access the patio area. By my valuation, the experience was overpriced but it was the right place to stay for a weekend getaway in Chinatown Manhattan.

For the first two days, I was told they were sold out and they couldn't move us for the first two nights.

We were told that they would straighten this out and by giving us a credit later. It's been 12 days since and my credit card was just charged, with no invoice or credit whatsoever for any part of my hotel stay. When I called and asked, they would not give me the name of a manager to talk with because they were overwhelmed with trying to fix the computer problem, and asked me, ""Could you call back tomorrow?""I asked that they call me back tomorrow and gave them my number. Then I was told that someone might call me back in a few days, they ""could not guarantee that someone could call me back tomorrow."" If this was the case, then why did he ask me to waste my time calling back, when he couldn't ""guarantee me an answer?""I pointed out that they went ahead and charged my credit card with no notice of what the charges were, even though I left my email address with them. I also pointed out that the dates were all wrong. At least he acknowledged the date problem on the invoice.I would have rated them much higher if I had gotten some good pro-active customer service during the four times that I inquired about the problems. Still waiting for this to be resolved.I get that it wasn't the staff's problem with the technical glitch; however, after seeing them note down my name and being told that they have to deal with ""hundreds of guests"" that was not good customer service.

The front desk told me that the hotel switched that day to heat for the winter season and they can't provide air conditioning as well.

It's easy to catch a cab here anytime. I'm glad to have stayed here, and I would happily do so again. It delivers on the essentials: cleanliness, noise levels under control (despite being above the busy Bowery), free strong wifi, sufficient supply of towels and bath robe, good water pressure and temperature controls in the bathroom, and adequate toilet pressure. The bright, well-designed rooms mostly face north (always great light levels), with floor-to-ceiling windows that mitigate their modest sizes.

Compliments to the afternoon clerk Daniel, who cheerfully checked me in, and was very friendly and helpful.While the basics are absolutely solid at this hotel, but why don't I rate this place higher? A few small details prevent it from being a great hotel. The luggage check is somewhat chaotic due to lack of space. The food at the ground floor restaurant is generally forgettable. More than anything else, it also feels somewhat impersonal, even though it's not that huge a hotel. It's certainly does not feel unfriendly, but it doesn't feel all that welcoming either. Even when they are not ostensibly busy, most clerks here are completely indifferent as you come and go. Just a few nods or subtle smiles of acknowledgement will do wonders.

The rooms had a nice TV with decent channel options as well as a safe, refrigerator, and a coffee maker. There was a small closet but very little other storage. The bathroom was a major challenge as there was no door on the shower, only a half wall which meant the entire floor for soaked. Between that and the humidity in our room, our towels were all completely drenched everyday. The only other complaint about the bathroom was the door. It was glass! And didn't latch properly and offered very little in terms of privacy. The restaurant onsite offered decent food, some things we got were really good, others not so much. Service was spotty.

Then we find out that our room wasn't available despite us getting there at 7. We had to wait while he found another available room. It seemed like originally we were supposed to have a higher floor room as he first checked the rooms on top, but after he placed us on the second floor, you know because they weren't available. Housekeeping apparently still hadn't cleaned it?Then the issue of the elevator- it seems the buttons don't work consistently. Some times after we swipe it would light up other times we had to press it multiple times. Oh and the elevator seems old and small too.When we got to our room it was tiny. I mean I could understand that part at least, but it was still small even for NYC standards. Another issue was the fact that there was no laundry machine.

I was in a corner room and could never get the temperature below 73 degrees, even though the thermostat was set at 60. I was told that it was because it was a corner room and I had two glass walls and the AC was blowing in the wrong direction. They tried to alleviate it with giving me a fan to help circulate the air, but it didn't do very much good. Of course, as I was leaving I found out one of my coworkers was also in a corner room and her temp was always at 68. So, who knows.The lobby is tiny, it's slightly claustrophobic, but that's NY.

It's funny how one person can change your feelings about a hotel by seeming genuinely caring.I admit that I was a bit annoyed from the start, when I called to talk to the hotel itself and could NOT get through... only to the main 800 Wyndham number. The 800 staff would not give me a direct hotel number... would only relay my questions while I waited on the phone. (i had some super specific questions, like whether the floor-to-ceiling windows were treated for privacy... the answer was going to affect the sleeping attire i brought.) I also requested the highest floor in our category and/or a corner room, letting them know it was a special occasion. There was absolutely no mention of this... no note of congratulations... no nothing. We had paid for a more expensive 'empire view' room' because it was a special anniversary. Our room barely had a view. Our request was ignored and when we politely asked, the answers were super officious. You know the drill... ""well, mam. we can get you a higher room for X-amount per night.... The woman working the front desk VERY grudgingly moved us to a corner room the second day (so annoying... i believe they are just betting that clients will not want to pack and move if they put off the room change to the next day.) I DO believe that she knew that the air conditioning wasn't working properly in the new room. It was almost 100 degrees that weekend. We got home that night, having let them know earlier that the air wasn't working, only to find an oscillating fan set up in the room. REALLY??So --- unbelievably hot and tired (being a tourist isn't easy!!) --- and on our actual anniversary night, we had to pack up and move again. In fairness, our next room did have a beautiful view. However, it had a balcony outside the windows, which I don't recommend. As others have mentioned, it is open to all rooms on the floor so there is really no privacy if your neighbors decide to walk around-- back and forth-- which our neighbors did frequently. (**note to future guests-- stay in front of your own room to enjoy the view!! It's just good manners, no?? Also-- the smell of (I assume prescription) pot was so very heavy on our floor that it was even strong in our room. This went on for 3 days. One could smell it from the elevator. I don't understand why the hotel doesn't take some control of this. I certainly didn't want to be the floor monitor on this issue, and chance an unpleasant confrontation with our neighbor. I feel this should have been their job... and it would be IMPOSSIBLE for them not to know. Honestly--- read my hundreds of reviews. I'm not usually so negative and am really quite forgiving. But this hotel has a couple of very unpleasant people at the front who really put us off so that things like broken air conditioning became harder to overlook.What we loved? The bed was super comfy. The room was kept super clean. The large windows are beautiful. We had a yummy breakfast in the bar area. Water pressure was excellent. Wifi was good. The rooms were very well insulated so that we couldn't really hear our neighbors. We liked the neighborhood... close to such a variety of cultures and experiences.

She informed that she had reported the issue and it was being addressed. When I was leaving I spoke to Mr. Mecca the night manager about my situation, and he said he would be willing to compensate me for issue with my room. I sent an email to the Sales Director and complimented all the staff I met at the hotel and thanked her for the compensation I was offered.

The rooms are nicely decorated and comfortable and the staff helpful. Depending on what time of year you come, room rates vary, but I have always found it to be a good to excellent value.

First impression: Fancy for budget in NYC. New hotel in Chinatown. Small sink. I don't think I'd go back, unless it was similarly priced, but it wasn't BAD or worthy of a 3-star rating. Small (but very nice and modern) rooms. Bathroom sink was really small, bathroom overall just so-so. BUT… VERY COOL: There’s a Penthouse bar on the 18th or 19th floor that had a cool vibe, floor-to-ceiling views looking uptown (Empire State Building was visible)… and zero people inside on a Monday night at 9pm. I love empty spaces like this, so I'd recommend it. If you're coming here as a business traveler, you won't be disappointed, you can get work done and it is a modern room.

Stations. We caught the J train from Jamaica after our arrival from the airport, so cheap. We even caught the train to Coney Island and back for the day. It is also a few minutes from the restaurants of Little Italy. We used the subway a lot, so it was no problem staying far from midtown, two to three stops from the action really. At night it was the best because we loved to eat at the restaurants nearby. We thought the staff were reserved but polite when we had questions. The room was a good enough size, clean and comfortable with an excellent TV just in a perfect position to watch it from bed. Bathroom big and super clean but the glass shower screen is definitely too small, so to stop the water from spraying everywhere, the pressure is low, so you cant take a quick shower because of that. The water was plenty hot enough though. The maid always left plenty of towels, of every size and her cleaning was the best I have enountered in any hotel stay. We had a wardrobe, safe, coffee machine with pods and teabags, a fridge and free water. The Chinatown location shouldn't bother anyone if they take the subway. It took us a day or two to get used to it.

For the first four nights, I was given a 12th floor queen room, with a wonderful view of the Empire State Building. Since I had a roommate joining me for the last half of my stay, I had reserved a double twin bed room. Because my roommate was arriving after taking a red eye flight, I asked if I could check into my new room early so that I wouldn't need to store my bags after I checked out of the first room. The staff went out of their way to help. They said that if the new room wasn't ready by the time I needed to leave for a meeting, I could just leave our bags in my old room and they would transfer them for us. Instead, housekeeping and the front desk worked hard to quickly get our new room ready. It happened to be the room right next door, so it made things very simple.The location of the hotel is perfect for those who want to stay in Manhattan, but not pay the price for being in midtown Manhattan, and avoiding the isolation of the FiDi. The Grand Street subway station is a very short walk, and that station has express service to the West Village, midtown, and into Brooklyn. Yes, the hotel is located in Chinatown, which can get crowded, with dirty streets, and an assault on the senses if you're not used to it. Get over all that. This is New York CIty.The only complaint I have about the hotel is something that they are unable or unwilling to address. There is absolutely NO way to have a shower and not create a flood. The glass partitioning wall does nothing to keep the water inside the shower. You'll need at least another towel or two to have on the floor because the shower mat they provide is woefully inadequate. I'm not usually someone who has housekeeping come into my room on a daily basis, but this was the only way to ensure getting fresh towels and clearing out the wet ones.","Calgary, Canada","blkjck5697</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",100,5.0

It's in Chinatown. Not necessarily a bad area, but it's not a trendy area or an area close to mainstream shopping or mainstream tourist attractions. It is a fairly close to a subway station for a NYer, but if you are a suburban person and not used to walking, it is NOT right around the corner from a subway either. Also, this is one of the busiest, most hustle bustle areas of town during daytime, so keep that in mind.It's a small hotel and the rooms are small. The windows are all glass, so depending on which aspect of the building you get a room in, you may get an excellent view.There is also excellent light in the bathroom because the walls are glass too.We didn't have a problem with noise, despite what other reviewers have written, but that might have been our luck.On the bad side, the separation between the bedroom and bathroom is glass as well and there is hardly any noise privacy. If I were to pick another negative, it is that the room is really small and the closet space is small too.We were perfectly happy with it for the price we paid which was good for NYC standards.","New York, NY","NellyAkGo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",14,4.0

The most surprising and disturbing thing in the bathroom was the shower, there was only half a shower door. After showering, I had to use several towels to dry the floor. The room, which is small (that's expected in NYC) could use some updating, the lamp was outdated and didn't provide adequate light for the room. And alas, the window didn't open, it's always nice to get some fresh air. The hotel is located close to the Brooklyn Bridge and several tourist attractions. I truly enjoyed being able to nearby Little Italy and eat at Ferrara Bakery, where the food and pastries were wonderful, and the waiter was truly welcoming and polite. One positive aspect of staying at this hotel was the reception staff, who were very accommodating, even when they were busy. That's certainly a plus. I ate at the hotel restaurant, mostly too avoid the unseasonably wet and cold weather, the food was adequate, but again the waiter was very friendly.

She greet the guests with smile and give helpful information. Aslo, I got a very serious problem with her colleague (night shift) about billing problem. She could handle very well with professional well train. She made all the issue clear, unlike the other one. The surrounding area will be closed and quiet after 9:00pm. There is no supermarket or convenience store open 24hrs or late at night. Thererfore, if you wanna buy something to drink please do it before get back to the hotel or you can buy bottle of water from the hotel. Overall if you are looking for a place to stay in Manhatton (Chinatown area) with good location.

I am always most appreciative when you are at a hotel where the cleaning and maintenance staff are welcoming and friendly. I had an issue with the heat and the maintenance man was there immediately, and even followed up (called) a few times to be sure problem was fixed. I thought that was impressive.

A really great deal on this hotel (offered at $160-180 a night depending on the room) kept us in the city for the weekend and we couldn't have been happier. The location is really great - right between Chinatown and Little Italy, a few blocks from the heart of Soho, and even walking distance (15 minutes or so) to Tribeca, Financial District, Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side. If you get bored staying here, its your own fault. You can also get to the Grand Street subway in about 5 minutes, and the Canal street station in about 8 minutes. Plus, if you want to take a taxi, we were pretty much able to walk out of the hotel and get one within 90 seconds at most. It is a high traffic spot, coming off the Manhattan bridge, so there are always empty cabs heading towards mid and uptown. Beyond the location, the staff is friendly, and the rooms are nice. It is a NYC hotel room, so don't expect anything spacious. If you can, get a higher floor room - there is a good reason why there is a rooftop bar there, as the height of the hotel in this part of town gives it an amazing view up towards mid town - a clear shot to the Empire State building - and on the front side towards the Freedom Tower. No major complaints about the room or hotel - good outlet accessibility, good HVAC, good bed and pillows, clean well appointments rooms. If I had to pick any complaints, I would say it would be that the hot water took a long time to get going in the morning (at least on the floor we were on), and that the shower is one of those that doesn't have a door that closes - must be something about this part of NYC, as I've stayed at others in the area with the same design. After three days I couldn't figure out how to take a shower without getting water splashing out of the shower. Truly a hidden gem in the area and great for anyone looking for a fun weekend in the city.","Barre, Vermont","musicfan76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barre, Vermont</strong>",6,5.0

There are not as many bars nearby, so it depends what you’re looking for. There is no bar in the hotel. There was no restaurant in the hotel at that time. There was a mix up with our room when we arrived – our booking had not recorded that we’d paid for an upper floor room, so we had to spend 2 nights on a lower floor before they could move us to the upper floor we had actually booked. We got a very small refund on our room rate for those two nights, but no compensation, and no real apology. The rest of our stay went smoothly. The rooms were clean, and the lifts were a good size. The view from our upper floor room once we got it was fantastic. They did store our luggage for us on the last day before we went to the airport. They called a taxi for us but the service was really poor, they tried to charge us per item of luggage rather than on the type of vehicle we hired – our luggage comfortably fit into a normal sedan with room to spare.

There is nothing that we can fault about this hotel except the distance from Times Square and it being a few blocks away from a tube station, which generally didn't bother us but at the end of the day when you begin to feel tired, it can feel a bit of a trek to get back. Otherwise, this was a perfect place. Quite, clean, reasonably room and pleasant, helpful staff. It feels very modern and the room was very stylish and immaculate.

We stayed for two nights during the Lunar New Year parade weekend. We were surprised that the cost was reasonable during such a busy time, we were convinced there must be something wrong with the place, but it was great!We had a corner room on the 8th floor and loved the views to the north and west. We could hear traffic on Bowery but it wasn't super loud and I always bring ear plugs with me when I travel anyway. The room was a little chilly, owing to the floor-to-ceiling windows (store bags and clothes away from the windows so you don't put on icy jeans!). The view was worth the chill. The thermostat was adjustable, and I like it at 65 F...I'm sure anyone could adjust it higher to counter the chill from the windows though.I really liked this hotel room and I definitely will be back, but I'm giving it a 4 rating instead of a 5 because the bathroom really irked me. I think the designers sacrificed functionality for form. It LOOKS beautiful but there were no towel racks! There is a very small hook behind the door, but nowhere else to hang a towel. Also, the shower has a glass half-partition, but this one felt shorter than half. As much as I tried to aim the shower head the opposite direction and close to the wall, water got everywhere. The toilet paper rolls hang right there, and they got soaked each time we showered. The floor is ICY in that bathroom - bring slippers or thick socks!!! But it did LOOK nice. It just wasn't as functional as I would have liked. It won't preclude another stay, but I felt it was pertinent to add this info so other people are aware and prepared.Overall, this was a great stay.

The lobby is super clean and always staffed with a friendly smiling face at the front desk. There is a bar/restaurant on the main level, and a rooftop bar, both of which we did not use, but we checked them out and the view from the rooftop was definitely a nice one looking uptown towards the Empire State. The entire building is new, I would guess under 3 years old, so everything is new and fresh and contemporary which is always a treat.

It's about 3 blocks from Little Italy and maybe 9 to Soho.All the beds are doubles and the rooms are almost as small as in Paris, but I've heard that's common in Manhatten. My husband and I usually sleep on a king and we don't sleep well, but we had no problems sleeping. The bed was firm but comfortable. No sign of bedbugs. Very nice pillows and they promptly brought us extras when we requested them. We also requested a portable room fan for white noise for sleeping and they promptly provided that. We were on the 5th floor and near the elevator and if we hadn't had the fan, we would probably have heard some street and elevator noise. The street was fairly quiet at night and the hotel is so small there's not allot of people in the halls to create noise though. The staff was very courteous. Our only issue is that the shower door is like they have in Europe, only covering half the needed area so that tons of water spews out on the bathroom floor. I don't understand why anyplace would want that, since it's got to decrease the life of the bathroom flooring. Make sure you have plenty of towels to sop it up. The top floor restaurant is currently closed for remodeling. If the price stays reasonable we would definitely stay here again.

Not great, but definitely serviceable. Everything looked new and clean, as far as I could tell. Everything was very small but I assume that is standard in NYC (this was my first trip there). The price was pretty reasonable compared to other NYC prices, but still kind of high for what you get. It was pretty close to a train station, so it wasn't too hard to get around. The area itself was pretty dead though, there were no bars, stores, pharmacies, etc other than the small grocery stores that comprise Chinatown and those all shut down pretty early. The restaurants were not very clean looking, so I did not partake in any of them. You'd have to walk at least 20 or so minutes to get to anything good. The hotel bar and restaurants were closed, with just a printed notice in the rooms telling you it was closed for menu changes, which seems weird for a supposedly new location. It was just really inconvenient since there wasn't much else around to go to, it would have been nice to have a place to eat quickly. I overheard the hotel staff being very short and kind of rude to a customer who was inquiring about this. I guess they're tired of answering questions about it, but there's no need to be rude. It's your job. As far as the room goes, the bed was comfortable. There was very little storage for clothes, just a very small armoire, no dresser or anything. The view from our room wasn't terrible if you turned your head and looked down the street.The bath room is my biggest complaint, but I think we were in a handicapped room so that could explain some of it. There was absolutely no place to put your toiletries. There was a pedestal sink with no room for anything. No counter space, no shelf above the sink, nothing. There is a very small shelf next to the shower, that's really the towel rack, so we put a couple things there, but most things had to cram into the very small clothes armoire and be carried in and out (I felt like it was a dorm bathroom!). Also, the shower was walk in, so it had no curtain or door -- aka no way to stop the water from escaping. The floor would be SOAKED every time one of us would shower, and we'd have to use all the extra towels to sop it up or else stand in water while you dry off.Overall, it was fine. You don't go to NYC to sit in your room. But after walking around all day it would have been nice to have a place to go back to where you can relax, and this wasn't really the place to do so","Saint Louis, Missouri","Amanda H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",14,3.0

Staff are friendly and helpful, even though they didn't really believe us when we called down to reception to tell them we had no TV remote (?!) and one of them came up to look in the drawers (as if we hadn't already) - a new remote was brought to the room within a quarter of an hour. The beds are comfy - we stayed in a twin room, so space was at a premium, but it didn't feel too cramped. The bathroom had a frosted window on the inside - unusual and I'm not sure I really liked that, despite the bonus of natural light in the bathroom. Best not to look too closely when sitting on the loo either, since the shower configuration meant it basically pointed out of the glass half-wall, and the tiles stopped after 3 inches, meaning the wallpaper had started to peel. My dad and I enjoyed peering down out of the window at the junction of Bowery and Hester to figure out why everyone was beeping their horns all the time. This was fine during the day and early evening, but it did disturb his sleep when there was a traffic jam at 11.30pm (I wore ear plugs, so missed the excitement). The in-room air con was also noisy, but effective. Strange bubbling noises seemed to emenate from a service room opposite ours, possibly linked to common areas air con or the elevators? Sometimes this was quite loud, but not at night.The hotel is well situated, on the edge of Chinatown and close to Little Italy, with two subway stops within easy walking distance (2-3 blocks at most), which was very useful as we used the subway almost exclusively to get around. It benefits from being the tallest building in the area, with excellent views of the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings if you're facing North. Sadly, by the time we decided to go to the rooftop bar to have a drink and a look around up there, it was shut for a 'menu revamp', and we couldn't even go to just take a few photos. Would I stay here again?

The street this hotel is on (Bowery) doesn't have a lot happening at night (mainly lighting stores) so if you're looking for lots of nightlife, there isn't much in this area (not that I found anyways...and especially compared to Times Square). I had a room on the corner of the 12th floor facing north and it had the most beautiful view of the city at night. The room itself was a decent size (I've stayed in smaller and bigger) so I think it's pretty average. Everything was very clean and new so I think you can't go wrong for the price.

Anyway, my dislike of the city, which is dirty, noisy, overpriced and way too pleased with itself just for being there does not extend to the Wyndham, which was by far the best of the 3 hotels we used. Located in Chinatown, which is a longish walk from mid-town and the best known 'attractions', but there is a subway - best of luck trying to use it, it is ultra confusing. The hotel itself looks pretty new and is nicely finished. We had a room on the 15th floor, and this floor has a balcony (the rest don't, except possibly up in the penthouse area, we didn't check) and faced directly at the Empire State Building. Please note that the balcony is communal, i.e. it runs all the way round the building and is really just for viewing from, there is no furniture of any kind out there.Room itself was spotless and equipped with the usual water, tea and coffee making facilities and a very nice bathroom. I would like to particularly mention the front desk staff, both the ladies and the gentlemen who were ultra helpful with arranging cars, calling taxis and just generally answering our queries. Also a mention to Jimmy behind the bar who looked after us very well. It was all downhill from the Wyndham as regards the NYC 'experience', but if you're determined to go, we really did like this hotel very much and would recommend.","Aberdeen, United Kingdom","mawreece</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aberdeen, United Kingdom</strong>",39,5.0

We're talking splash damage everywhere.....or a mini flood in the bathroom when you're done. By the way, they didn't clean the shower properly. There was quite a bit of hair left in the shower drain and under the drain, black slime buildup. I was grossed out big time!!!! Pictures are worth a thousand words.

The room and entire hotel was very clean, and our room was decent size. The staff was great! Everyone was very nice and helpful. The location was good, very close to the subway, although I hate the fact it is right in the middle of a fish market, whew stinky! The rooftop bar at the hotel had just recently re-opened, however the first night we stayed there it was closed for a private party. The second night we had a pre-show drink up in the lounge, it was very nice, very reasonable during happy hour. The prices to get on the rooftop were ridiculous! If we are paying guests at the hotel we should be able to enjoy the rooftop without the hefty entry fee, the drink prices should be enough of a cost to be up there. I had read there was a drink minimum, but I guess that recently changed to an entry fee + 1 drink. But to be clear you can go to the bar inside and there is a great view, the fee is only to be on the rooftop.The only problem we had with the room was when we arrived. We had been assured we had rooms next to each other (we had 2 rooms for 4 friends), one room with 1 bed and one with 2 beds, and that we had a balcony. In fact we were told back in April/May when this was arranged that our rooms had already been assigned. I called once before we arrived to check this arrangement, and I was assured it was still booked that way. When we arrived we were told only one of the rooms was on the 2nd floor (therefore had a balcony) and not only was the room with 2 beds not next door, it wasn’t on the same floor. Further, we were told there were no doubles on the second floor, period. I must have misheard him, because we found out the next day that there were in fact doubles on the second floor (we could see in the window), and in fact there was one next door to our friends. That was infuriating. If you accidentally gave out “our” room that is one thing, but to tell us there are no doubles on that floor was a bit far. The balcony on the 2nd floor was nothing to write home about, it is a shared space between all the rooms with no chairs or furniture on it, but it did allow fresh air into the room, and we would have been next door to our friends, which was our entire purpose of this trip to NYC, to spend time catching up. All of these other reviews are correct, there are huge windows (although we did not have a floor with a view), the shower water can be messy (but we liked the nice water pressure!), it could be loud if you are on one end of the hotel (corner of Bowery & Hester, so ask for a room away from that corner if that is a concern)....For the right price I would certainly stay here again. It was clean, well located, and overall a nice stay. I did not give them a lower rating because of the room mis-hap, but just be forewarned it happened to us, so if rooms are important to you, call an confirm again and get names.",Texas,"hyatt22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Texas</strong>",34,4.0

The rooms aren't large, but they're well designed and efficient. I wish there had been hooks for towels in the bathroom, and we ran up huge cab bills getting to and from the hotel from other areas of the city because the traffic in chinatown during rush hours can be impossibly slow. But if business or pleasure keeps you downtown this is a great location. One serious criticism is the in-hotel restaurant called ""Elevate."" Avoid this at all costs. The first morning we tried to have breakfast there, the waiter informed us that the only beverages available for our kids was soda. We went back the next morning having been told that the full breakfast menu was now available, but it was a huge disappointment.

This was fine except that the pull out couch was not prepared for someone to sleep on it. No bed sheets.

Called the front desk, told them their mistake, and they told me there is nothing they can do because the room I reserved for is occupied! WHAT THE HELL? What is the point of me making prepaid deposit for a room that was NOT reserved for me? I had a baby with me and hence I reserved the bigger room for my family. 3. The front desk did not offer me any solution, not another hotel room, not another room in a nearby hotel, then offered me only 20% off the first night. Then promise to move us back to the room we ORIGINALLY booked for the second day. Did not offer extra help. It's creating alot of work for us because we have to re-pack and unpack and they show no sign of remorse. Anyways, I am most pissed about them not mentioning it on the day I checked in, that the room I reserved for was not the room that was assigned to me.

One complaint: we had booked a superior room ""with a balcony"" (which by necessity requires that we be on a higher level) and they tried to give us a room on the second floor. Thanks to the advice here that the lower floors would be noisy due to the street noise, we stuck to our guns and got the 7th floor.

The fitness center and the equipment were excellent. The air conditioning did not work as well as I would have liked.

Further, I had the fan on auto and it never turned off, even when the thermostat showed the temperature in the room was where I wanted it to be. Finally, in the afternoon the room would be warm and it seemed like the air conditioning couldn't handle it, then mysteriously in the early evening the air conditioning would cool the room nicely. In the early morning the temperature in the room would begin to rise. (In an earlier review it is mentioned that the sun caused this. I'm not so sure, because the temperature in the room would start to rise at 6:30 a.m. and go down around 6:30 p.m. - there hasn't been enough time for the warm up or the quick cool down.","Atlanta, Georgia","Mike C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",4,4.0

I did find a couple of patches of mulch for her but it was full of broken glass, We did have a very nice room. It was a corner king suite with a sofabed and small fridge. The room was very hot and humid so I called for service to fix it. A repair man came and said that he took care of it. During the night it did go down a couple of degrees but by the next morning it was a sauna again. They did move us to a one bedroom suite that was much better. I was told that all of the corner suites are hot when the weather is sunny. I only had takeout from the restaurant but it was very good. Parking was $60 a night but worth it as all of the self parks were $50 for a minivan and it was worth the extra $10 not to have to do it ourselves. I was hoping that I could find a 7 Eleven or similar but there was nothing of that at all. I wanted Asian culture and I got it. The first night I wanted some cans of Pepsi but they had removed all of the soda vending machines so a very rude man walked me down to their breakroom to use that vending mach. I think that he hated me as he then had to walk rather than sit to do his texting from two phones. Ling was the best. The hotel should be all Lings. Guests in rooms on the second floor have access to a large balcony but I didn't see any chairs or tables. The lounge area is very nice and you can get food there also.

However, there were a few oddities I feel the need to comment on. 1) The bathroom had a frosted glass door and frosted wall between the shower and bed. Not a problem for us, but could be for those needing a little privacy. 2) Like most hotels, this one encourages you to hang up towels to use again, but there is no towel rack. Just a two-sided hook where the hair dryer is stored. 3) The restaurant is nice, but automatically adds on gratuity. This might be a New York thing. I noticed comedy clubs did it too.Still, this is a clean, modern building, with comfortable beds, attractive decor, in a culturally interesting neighborhood close to the subway.

We’ve stayed at other hotels on Manhattan and expected small rooms, older furnishing, limited service – all in exchange for location.We made our way through the exotic streets of Chinatown to our hotel and experienced our first surprise: the building looked brand new and smaller than we’d imagined with an interesting glass façade. After a friendly check-in, we used the elevator to get to our room on th 12th floor, hardly a high floor by Manhattan standards. And opened the door to the second big surprise: the room appeared large through smart design, the bathroom was cool modern with neat lighting, and the view was jaw-dropping. After tearing ourselves away from the window, we noticed the neat little touches, space to hang up clothes next to a convenient practical desk area, the luggage stand fitting exactly in the space between closet area and wall.We slept wonderfully that night not just because we’d done our sports by crossing the Brooklyn Bridge twice on foot but because of the great mattress.But before we went to bed, we enjoyed the ***** fantastic view from the City View Lounge on the 18th floor for chilling on our last night in Manhattan and the US. The view was as good as that from our room, the server friendly, the drinks cold, and the music perfect. We’d return anytime and maybe enjoy service on the fantastic open-roof top above the lounge too. Just a pity TripAdvisor doesn’t have a separate listing for the City View Lounge since it’s open to non-hotel guests too. (We couldn’t charge our drinks to our rooms since the proprietor is separate from the hotel.)And as the last pleasant surprise next morning: no normal breakfast buffet but breakfast a la carte with fine ingredients – and the somewhat slow service slowed us down before our last day of touring Manhattan.My Spanish husband made friends with the Dominican assistant and we easily clarified the problem with breakfast – it should've been included in the room rate but was listed extra – with the manager.

Water pressure was okay but not super strong.Service was excellent and housekeeping great too.No complaints over staff what so ever - all friendly and helpful :) Wifi worked great too. The terrace room does feature a large shared balcony with 5-6 other rooms so it is not very private - a few flowerpots to divide the space and a couple of chairs would have been a great improvement. The view is fabulous though. The room is extremely small for two people. Only room for one suitcase and does look a lot smaller than the rooms shown on website but it might only be this room? There is an ice-maker right outside this room which is quite noisy at night so if you are a light sleeper avoid it.

Had I paid 180 US I would have been happy.(no breakfast included).Location: It is a few blocks to the subway on Bowery street but that is only brown and orange line which does not take you uptown. For uptown you need to walk over to Canal street which takes about 10 min. Restaurant and shopping starts in little Italy and Chinatown a few blocks away so not a bad location.

Room was good, fairly spacious and bathroom small but comfortable and stylish. WiFi worked well and was included. Room came with balcony, but BEWARE. The balcony is a shared balcony with all the other rooms on that floor on street side. This does not feel safe and takes away the sense of privacy. We did not find this comfortable, but the hotel could not offer an alternative. We booked including breakfast, this was continental and basically means coffee, juice, fruit and either a pastry basket (mini-croissant, mini-muffin and mini-danish) or oatmeal (not both). No savoury toppings, just a mini-jar of jam. You can choose a warm option (e.g. eggs with bacon & toast) by paying extra, but be prepared to pay USD 5 per person extra, not the USD 2 difference on the menu. We got into a whole discussion with the breakfast room staff due to them adding tax and service charges etc. Not worth the uncomfortable discussion and avoidable if they were more clear on the actual extra costs on forehand. Knowing what we do now, we would not book breakfast and grab something elsewhere, as the USD 10 for the continental is NOT worth the money. The breakfast room is in a restaurant offering sushi for lunch and dinner, with fair prices. We didn't try it, but it appeared good. Atmosphere at breakfast was not great, staff was not unfriendly, but lacked any enthusiasm or smile. You can go up to the roof of the hotel for a great view of NYC. Location-wise, it is good for exploring south manhattan, and about 5-8 min. from the nearest subway. We did a lot on foot. I was not that comfortable with the neighbourhood (especially Canal Street towards night time did not feel nice) and both Chinatown and Little Italy were disappointing, so not worth being in the middle of. Lacked nice restaurants or coffee bars in the street. But that is personal preference. We were on the 2nd floor and I had to sleep with ear plugs in, but my boyfriend did not, so depends on being a light sleeper or not.

When you're going alone Manhattan is undeniably very expensive. Admittedly I got a great deal on this hotel through booking.com so wouldn't have been able to afford it otherwise but if I compare it to somewhere like the Cosmopolitan hotel in Tribeca which is about the same price normally if not more, this hotel is better in every way and totally worth it. The hotel room size was much larger than other hotels I was looking at with the same star rating, the staff were very friendly, my room always clean and coffee etc replaced every day. These may seem like things that you would assume all hotels did but I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the last few months with higher ratings and have come to learn there are many things you can't assume! I asked for a quieter room, which they fulfilled, my neighbours were pretty noisy in the morning but I can't blame the hotel for that! I also spilled something in my room and they sent a cleaner up right away to deal with it. I don't have a bad thing to say about the hotel. I can't comment much on the restaurant, I had breakfast there one morning which was OK but have a feeling the lunch and dinner menu may be better, it has very good reviews on google. Although bang in the middle of Chinatown, the location was great too 5-10 minutes walk to shops and two minutes to the closest subway (Grand St) and close to areas like Tribeca and West Village too.Nice powerful shower too, would definitely stay here again.","London, United Kingdom","coletteb798</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",23,5.0

The hotel is located 2 blocks from a subway station (Grand St, B & D trains).We found this hotel to be priced well, compared to many other hotels in Manhattan. Yes, the rooms are smaller than a typical hotel room, but it's New York City. But with two of us in the room, we found it to be sufficient. The decor, both in the lobby and in the room itself, was stylish and modern. The room was clean and well-stocked with amenities (bottles of water, toiletries, etc), and the bed and pillows were comfy. Wifi worked very well for us, and we didn't experience much street noise (though we did have a loud, noisy neighbor one night). The front desk staff was particularly friendly, helpful and efficient.There were, however, some minor flaws we experienced. *Our room (702) had a balcony, which is great, but the balcony was shared with the rest of the floor. In other words, we could walk past all the other rooms from the outside and even see into the other rooms if the curtains were open. It made me a little uncomfortable, and made me double and triple-check that our balcony door was locked. We also never opened our curtains.*The shower didn't have a curtain or any sort of enclosure, which caused a lot of water to splash out of the shower and onto the floor. We used our extra towels as bath mats because there was so much water outside of the shower. Even the toilet paper rolls got wet because the water from the shower splashed out.*The only towel hooks in the bathroom were on the opposite end of the bathroom, so you had to walk out of the shower (and drip all over the bathroom) to get to the towel hooks. Hooks or even a towel bar could've easily been placed right by the shower (there was plenty of wall space in our room).*When we arrived back to the hotel one evening after a long day of sightseeing, we went to the bar ask for a bottle opener to open a bottle of Coke we had purchased. We stood at the bar for almost 10 minutes (no one was behind the bar, but there were plenty of patrons sitting at the bar). When the bartender finally arrived, we realized he had been standing outside the whole time and had seen us waiting there but never bothered to come in and even acknowledge us. That was our only poor service experience at this hotel.Despite the flaws, we would stay here again. The price, the location (close to a subway station), the cleanliness, and the great staff (front desk, at least) make it worth it to stay here again when we return to NYC.","Las Vegas, Nevada","travelteamSDF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",68,4.0

After consulting TripAdvisor, decided to try this Wyndham hotel in Chinatown. We were not disappointed. Clean, quiet (quiet in the building - there was some street noise - car horns), comfortable. Responsive, friendly staff (actually much more friendly than you will find in larger hotels Uptown). $100 less per night compared to our favorite Midtown choice, Novotel. One thing to note - if you are sensitive to left-over cigarette smoke look elsewhere - this hotel's regular clientele appears to routinely ignore the no-smoking restriction. Our room had previously been occupied by a heavy smoker which the hotel promptly set about remedying. It didn't matter to us, but it may to you.The lower level restaurant for breakfast was a bit odd - my guess is it is independent of the hotel. Good price and food with very uneven, yet friendly service. Not busy. The ""Cup and Saucer"" diner nearby is a much better option (classic NYC diner - prompt, friendly service with good food at bargain prices). Excellent location for financial district, ChinaTown, Staten Island Ferry, Brooklyn Bridge type of day. Several good restaurants nearby.In summary - if you are looking for a NY hotel bargain, this is it. The trade-off is spending more time commuting to sites on the subway (up to 60 extra minutes a day compared to staying in Midtown).

PLUS, at 5am when the lights are off and your guest is trying to sleep they won't be asleep fr long when you put the bathroom light on. With the window there it lights the entire hotel room! Second, no shower door! There's a tiny glass partition but only on the shower head side. After my shower there was a huge puddle on the floor. I used three towels just sopping it up.

Some brilliant dumpling houses nearby - $1 for 4 dumplings is a bargain lunch/dinner/snack. Little bit of street noise still, which didn't impact sleep once I had inserted my ear plugs. It's New York after all, so I don't expect it to be completely silent. Room extremely clean, very comfortable bed and pillows.

The hotel is only about 5 years old so, as you would expect, it's very modern on the outside and the inside. It certainly stands out in Chinatown anyways!All of the staff were very friendly, accommodating and gave good advice whenever you asked them. The hotel rooms were very modern, clean and they were average in size for New York. It's very unusual to have a 'big room' in New York.The area isn't fantastic but all of the locals are friendly enough and the hotel is a 5 minute walk to Canal Street Subway and from there there's multiple subway lines taking you to locations across New York. The subway is really cheap as well. We got a taxi home from Times Square, on St Patrick's Day evening after a few beers, and it cost 15USD including tip. I would expect it to be a lot more during the day with traffic. The hotel also arranged a taxi for us to Newark Airport for 79USD as the weather wasn't great - the bellman arranged this and the service was great and the transfer arrived 10 minutes early.We wanted to visit the Skyline Bar but this always seemed to be closed whenever we wanted to visit it.We also requested a high floor room as we wanted views of the Skyline and also we didn't want to be too low down as we were aware the traffic can be quite loud at all times of day! The hotel acknowledged our request and, thankfully, we were allocated room 1204 which was a twin room.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anybody staying in New York.

Although I ended up walking pretty much everywhere, if you like walking then it's probably the best way to explore New York. The room itself was clean and comfortable, small and compact but it had everything I needed except, which pretty much every hotel lacks, towel rails. All hotels want you to re-use towels but then don't provide adequate racks for drying etc. But that was it for me, as for quietness actually this hotel was pretty good but considering you're in New York, there is going to be noise, always take those earplugs with you and a good nights sleep should be guaranteed.

I spent 9 days here eight months earlier, and was impressed enough to say that whenever possible, this would be my NYC home going forward. With that in mind, I booked a quick 4 night trip over the Presidents Day weekend.Upon check in, the front desk clerk looked up at me at said ""welcome back."" She had recognized my face from my previous stay. She couldn't remember my name initially, but caught on as I began to say it. Check in was a breeze, and that was a great way to start off the trip. The queen room was clean and comfortable, and was a good size for a Manhattan hotel room.My main previous issue with the rooms at this hotel was the shower setup, which resulted in a fair amount of water collecting on the floor. That's an issue that won't get solved anytime soon. This time around, there were two things that annoyed me to the point that I could only give a 4 star rating this time around. The first issue was the water temperature in the shower. On some of the coldest days in the winter, the water temperature at whatever time I took a shower was downright tepid. It meant for some quick showers and a fair amount of shivering afterwards. Not good when the air and wind chill temperatures were 0 to -10F (-15 to -25C). My next door neighbour indulged twice in room service, and when done, left his dish tray out in the hallway. Both times, the trays were left in the hallway for more than 4 hours, as they were there when I left my room and still there when I came back.

I had stunning views on the 8th floor of the gorgeous NYC skyline, I kept my curtains open throughout the evening just so I could wake up to that beautiful view! Seeing the Empire State building all lit up and gorgeous just before you fall asleep is just incredible and a view I will never forget. I know many people have mentioned about the bathrooms having a frosted glass panel letting light in from the room into the bathroom, and to be honest, it never bothered me. In fact, I wouldn't mind my bathroom at home looking like that! The bathroom was brand new with a wonderful shower and was light and spacious thanks to that frosted glass wall.  Even the cleaning staff were lovely! I got speaking to one lovely lady when I popped back to drop off some shopping before popping back out to see a show and she was absolutely lovely and had nothing but lovely things to say about the hotel, which is always a good sign! She did say that next time I should try and get a corner room as they have even BETTER views (if there is such a thing!) so I shall keep that in mind for my inevitable next visit. Transportation is excellent with Grand St Subway station about 50m away from the hotel front doors and there is an abundance of good food around the Little Italy area which I shall 100% utilise properly next time. The only slightly negative point that I had was that the restaurant on site wasn't the best (and I'm not really picky about food) but if that's the worst thing about the hotel, my goodness they're not doing badly at all!

I booked the handicapped accessible room because the website said ""Manhattan view."" The room had a view of the financial district, which was quite pretty at night. We stopped in the 18th floor bar (seemed to only be open on the weekend) and saw the midtown view which was even better. The sound-proofing was excellent; despite the busy street below, we heard very little of it. My only complaint was that the handicapped accessible room was not very convenient for non-wheelchair-bound people. The shower head was really low- my husband couldn't stand up under it - and water sprayed everywhere in the bathroom because there was no shower curtain and the glass of the shower stall was not wide enough.

Awesome location. The rooms are small but they are immaculate and gorgeously decorated. Besides, who goes to NYC and stays in their room??The only bad thing I have to say is that upon check-in I was told that we had the option of going with the room I booked which had a balcony or we could get a room a few floors higher with no balcony and a king bed instead of a queen. We wanted the better view so we chose the higher up room (the view was incredible, btw!). I asked if they were the same price since I had already dropped close to $300 for the original room at which point I was informed that this was an upgrade so we were actually getting a better deal. I don't know how getting a slightly bigger bed and losing the balcony is an upgrade but whatever.. Also I gave them my credit card for ""incidentals"" and they charged $50 to it upon check in. It's still pending so hopefully it will disappear in the next day or so. I would have appreciated being told that this was going to happen.

Just cross the street and have a coffee in Little Italy.We were little bit concerned about the location but were pleasantly surprised to see a lot of young people on streets,in the restaurants around.The hotel is new, clean and comes with a beautiful top roof bar and terrace.We enjoyed a drink on top and the view of the city.Great hotel.Can recommend to anyone.","Miami, Florida","lynnmiteva</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",7,5.0

We were there the week before Christmas, but another time of year we might have enjoyed the outdoor lounge with views. The free wi-fi worked well, but asked you to login in seemingly on each use. Two elevators were more than adequate; never any waiting. But for me, the surprising pleasure was location. We visit New York a few times a year and always use subways. At this location, you have your pick: a block away from the D (with transfer to the F or a quick trip to West 4th ) and a few blocks from the 6, you have your pick: midtown, west-side, east-side, all the different places I wanted to go were easy. And locally, within a 10-minute walking radius this somewhat gritty but rapidly changing neighborhood offers great coffee and food choices (it’s not just Chinese anymore): far more varied than midtown or the Empire State Bldg. area, for example.","Atlanta, Georgia","reprof</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",84,4.0
