In normal times, a reservation is necessary and for a hotel coffeeshop that is a bother. Regretfully the pricing is ridiculous for most items on the menu but if that is the price I have o pay to keep it, as it is, then, ok, I will. Still it seems not difficult to understand that instead of asking nearly 2000 yen for a glass of champagne it is better to sell a bottle at 12,000 to 15000 of, for example ,Bollinger or Taittinger as you might actually sell them.

The location is outstanding making it a very convenient trip from Nartita. Don't hesitate to request ahead of time to be met at your train by staff as navigating the trip from the train to the hotel is challenging for any seasoned traveler. It's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the outstanding service provided by the concierge team. As a guest we were afforded access to the health club onsite for a nominal charge. The facility is luxury as well. Our lunch in the main floor exceeded it's already stellar reputation. The luxury, staff and service made this a highlight of our trip to Hong Kong, Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka. Even after checking out and leaving for Kyoto, on the way back through Tokyo Station, staff met us at our train and took our luggage to the Narita Express. Their is no way we could have navigated the train station in time to make our connection. REMEMBER, WE HAD ALREADY CHECKED OUT OF OUR HOTEL A WEEK PRIOR when they contacted us asking what train we were on from Kyoto, to make sure they met us at the train car. They also assisted us in purchasing tickets to Kyoto after we checked out. Just as when we arrived, they carried our luggage and gleefully engaged us in conversation and delivered us to our destination. At this point, I want to make the special effort to acknowledge the lead Chief Concierge Marie Antoinette Mori and one member of her staff, Miyuki Saito.

If the walls could talk!!! This hotel was once the offices of the railway station. Check in as smooth a silk and I was guided to my room. Heritage brochure given on arrival and walls full of paintings, prints and photographs of the buildings former life. The hotel has a wonderful selection of restaurants - I chose Camellia for dinner which is a bar / restaurant, which was an excellent choice - sausages and onion rings - delicious with some Japanese whisky. Bar staff speak excellent English which is so for all the hotel. To the Lobby Lounge for a nightcap - not my intention but I heard the harp music being played with such angelic talent my attention was lost in absorbing attraction. If I had known I would have arrived much earlier.Breakfast the following morning - my, what a selection in the Dome. I didn’t know where to start but I went around several times to sample a little of each on offer. I was suitably impressed with this restaurant also. As I was leaving the waiter gave me a cookie and crisp bread to take away as I told him I was taking a train from Tokyo later that morning. This is a hotel that mixes the arts and heritage. It is inspirational for its history. The concierge were helpful though they chose to check museum opening by the internet rather than calling (it being the weekend of the introduction of limitation of opening caused by Covid 19), and hence I was misinformed. Front desk super efficient and looked after my bags until I returned four days later. The only downside of this hotel is the size of some of the rooms - my cupola room was just 30 Sq meters. I understand that the shape and size is dictated much by the nature and shape of the building. Notwithstanding, I didn’t spend too much time in my room so no big issues. The proximity to the station is one very positive element to staying here. All platforms within walking distance.A great hotel and a wonderful experience, especially for rail enthusiasts.

We are a family of 4 from HONOLULU HAWAII. Our kids are 4 and 14. This hotel is formal and its layout it like a football field long. The layout of the hotel stays true to the original 1915 building, but its cramped, has 14' high ceilings and very small rooms. They required us to buy 2 rooms to house the family. I wanted to buy a $1200 2 floor room with ample sq footage, but even that was not allowed (meaning occupancy by more than 2). So they are very much a luxury type hotel but for us (being from Hawaii, but totally used to travel all over the world) the rules were a burden, and detracted from our stay. The elevator to the spa was 60 yards down a hall tot he first floor, then get off and walk to another elevator to get to the basement. Nothing FLOWS here. We are on a wing and the logical entrances are blocked off (meaning not open) so we have to walk 60 yards to the main are, then down, and 60 yards back to the same location to get 2 floors down outside. Totally inconvenient and abnormal considering it being a luxury hotel. We were given 1 key for each room. To get into the hallway you need a key. To power up the room you need a key. So this meant figuring our who could go where and when, as when I asked for another key (for a total of 2 per room) it was advised it was not policy, and then met with confusion. They sent a bellman with another key. Thanks! but this made the original key unusable! So we still had only 1 key. So I went down the 60 yard hall to the main check in area to get a second key for each room. More language confusion ensued. AHHHH. My overall impression is that the PEOPLE here are so humble, kind and helpful. The rules are not flexible even to common sense. And this recipe makes it a place I wouldn't recommend unless you're a seasoned Japanese traveler. We had another episode trying house the spa. Down the 60 yard hell. Advised that we should NOT be wearing robes in the hotel common area. Looked at in shock. We went all the way back to change into normal clothes, bringing our swim suites with us this time. back down he 60 yard hall, only to find out the spa is gender separate, and no kids allowed. (of course) So by now we've walked this place so may times without getting anything done its soured us. Again. Not the people. Its the Policies. The 2020 Olympics are coming here. Id imagine these luxury hotels might want to get a little Flexible and stop with the unbending rules or it'll make for some unhappy guests. Japan. We love your culture in general. But this formality is a burden! With respect. Mahalo!","Honolulu, Hawaii","stevethepoolman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",27,4.0

It was delicious, and as we were leaving the restaurant the staff gave us a gift of a wrapped rice cake to eat later on our journey. (It was also delicious, we ate it later on the Bullet Train).The Reception staff were extremely helpful, polite and efficient. Check-in was seamless and a young lady accompanied us to our room to show us around and answer any questions. They lent us umbrellas when we ventured out for a morning walk in the rain.On our departure a young man accompanied us into the train station, wheeling both of our suitcases, and took us all the way to the platform gate where we would board our Bullet Train. We felt this service went above and beyond our expectations.Overall this hotel was a fabulous introduction to Tokyo and Japan, and our only regret was we did not stay longer.

Big malls, shops (both high-end and wallet-friendly boutiques), and restaurants surround the station, including beneath it. It is worth a day of exploring on its own. Grab a map of the place and tap on Ms Mori's excellent concierge team for advice, otherwise getting lost is a real probability. Rooms Gorgeous and classy in every way. You will love how tastefully the rooms have been put together. There are a wide array of rooms, with some categories offering unique features. The Dome side rooms (which we stayed this time) for instance looks into the interiors of the Tokyo station. From there, one can observe the thousands of commuters that go about their day from the calm and tranquility of the room. The Palace view rooms offer a majestic vista of the Imperial Palace grounds.The entry rooms are compact but never claustrophobic, thanks to the high ceilings and good layout. The mid-level Superior rooms are amongst the largest in Tokyo and would be our recommendation. A lot of attention is placed on the bathroom area so those who enjoy a nice shower or a hot soak in the tub will absolutely love what the hotel has done. In short, these are rooms you will want to spend time in, so don't just use the hotel merely as a convenient base to travel. It is so much more than that.ServiceWarm, attentive, and efficient, with good command of English to boot. They will be there for you, attending to every need. In our case, this care extends after checkout where the guest relations team found a quiet area for us to rest while waiting for a late flight home. This is Japanese hospitality at its finest. The service is so good, you may well regard them as friends and not just hotel staff, just as we did.Food In my earlier review, I wrote about the breakfast at the Level 4 Atrium as something not to be missed because of the huge spread and lovely setting. This remains very much the case. Do have breakfast included in your room rate. It is well worth it.I will now add the Lobby Lounge to the list of must-dos. The place combines a warm refined ambience, soothing live music from the resident harpist, and an extensive menu of drinks and light bites. The perpetual long queues attest to the quality. Go for their signature french toast with a pot of royal milk tea. We can't think of a more delectable way to enjoy a summer afternoon.Overall value-for-moneyThe Tokyo Station Hotel offers compelling value, especially when considering its incomparable location, classy interiors, top-notch service, and storied heritage. This hotel has all the qualities to compete with the best luxury hotels in the city, at prices that are more reasonable due to the good diversity of room types. Members of the Small Luxury Hotels (SLH) collection or World of Hyatt can additionally look forward to enjoying additional perks like early check-ins/late checkouts, breakfast and possibly even room upgrades. Do therefore consider enrolling for the membership if planning a major stay here. ",,720ricc,28,5.0

The service is incredible; the hotel, elegant. We stayed there twice in August. Once we had a queen sized bed in a palace view room; once we had a king bed in a dome room. I preferred the first despite the smaller bed. The rooms seemed equally small but the queen room was better laid out. They do manage to squeeze a lot in a small space. The bathroom is large and there is a closet. I liked the view better in the palace side room, too. The beds were comfortable as were the pillows. The food was expensive; we did not eat there. There are plenty of places to eat around there. If you plan to eat in the station, be aware there are few eat-in restaurants there. The proximity to the station was the major reason we stayed there. We took the Narita Express in and nothing could have been easier. We took the Shinkasen to Kyoto-- again, easily. Trains around the city. It is great for that. The service in the hotel was great. They were able to order my tickets to Kyoto and charge them to the room. Then they had not one but two women guide us to the train, helping us with luggage. We appreciated that. The female concierge there is efficient and professional; we did not deal with the males, so I can't speak to them.

Prior to our arrival, we had contacted the hotel a number of times with various questions and have always gotten quick, courteous, and helpful responses.We chose to stay here because of the impeccable reputation of Ms. Mori and her concierge team.

Other hotels can claim to being near a metro station or a major interchange, and that is all good. But this majestic hotel sits directly at the most iconic train station in the country, and a stone's throw from the Imperial Palace. As a result of the convenience, you'll be fast-tracked to all major parts of Tokyo and even areas outside of Tokyo (e.g. Yokohama, Hakone) within 30 mins. The Tokyo Station is also a gold mine for food and shopping. Big malls, shops, and restaurants surround the station, including beneath it. Grab a map of the place and tap on the concierge for advice, otherwise getting lost is definitely a real probability. While the constant hive of activity within the train station can be a heady experience, an air of calm and tranquility greets you the moment you enter the hotel lobby. The crowds and noise give way to gentle instrumental music and polite guests/patrons. It is an amazing transition.Rooms In a word, beautiful. The rooms vary widely in size but are generally spacious across the room categories. Everything about the rooms (and corridors and common areas for that matter) exude class, elegance, refinement. They are tastefully furnished with lovely blend of natural lighting, light marble, wood, and teal carpets, and supplemented with quality luxury fittings.  A harmony of modernity and old world grandeur. These are rooms you will want to spend time in, so don't just use the hotel merely as a convenient base to travel.ServiceFriendly, attentive, and efficient, with good command of English to boot. Japanese hospitality and service excellence go hand in hand, and this is on full display by the staff - from the bell desk, front office, restaurants, and housekeeping. Everything is well-oiled and delivered with pride. The team of staff are clearly very happy to be part of the hotel, and have every reason to be.Food The breakfast at the Level 4 Atrium is not to be missed, not just for the wonderful array of Western and Japanese buffet spread but also for the wonderful restaurant ambience replete with high ceilings and natural light. It is a sight to behold. Be sure to have breakfast included in your room rate, or you'll be missing out on something memorable.Overall value-for-moneyThere are several compelling reasons why the Tokyo Station hotel merits your consideration. The most obvious would be the hotel's incomparable location and its classy service and quality. But it is so much more than that. This is also a hotel with a story - an iconic heritage that has evolved with the development of the country's capital. This is truly an experience beyond luxury. Factor in the competitive room rates, and you will very quickly appreciate all the rave reviews and accolades the hotel has received over the years and why it continues to rank so highly on TripAdvisor. Just to add, the hotel is part of the Small Luxury Hotels collection and is perhaps the crown jewel of the SLH collection. The hotel is proud of its association as displayed by the SLH badges on their uniforms and the collaterals around the hotel. This means that SLH members can look forward to enjoying additional perks like early check-ins/late checkouts, breakfast and possibly even room upgrades. Do therefore consider enrolling for the membership if planning a major stay here. ",,720ricc,28,5.0

We decided to try the station-view rooms, and we do kind of wish we had a room with an exterior view. If we had to do it over again, we would prefer that (especially to help us get used to the time change after traveling). Pros:*The staff goes above and beyond to make their guests have every comfort imaginable.*We took advantage of the train pick-up service at Tokyo Station, and we were *so* grateful we did. We got lost many times in that station, so it was helpful after 15+ hours of travel to have someone greet us right at the door of our arriving train (N'EX), take our bags, and lead us to check in.*Location. If you're doing a bit of walking, this is fairly central to things we were hoping to see, but also convenient (obviously) to the train station. We walked easily to Imperial Palace, Tsukiji Fish Market, and a few other places.*Bed was pretty comfortable (hard to say for sure because we were fairly jet-lagged!). The curtains were definitely black-out curtains :)*The bathroom had every amenity you could need (hair dryer, toothbrushes, razors, etc). and was nicely updated as well.Con:*Again, probably the room selection we made wasn't our favorite. It wasn't awful either, but I think we would prefer an exterior facing room in the future for some sunlight!","Boulder, Colorado","Amanda D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boulder, Colorado</strong>",31,5.0

From the moment you arrive you are treated so well, from being escorted to your room by the bell hop (please remember no tipping in Japan) who helps you navigate the hotel and also points out the various features of your room.The room has an old world charm with a really big bathroom with separate shower and bath and separate toilet (which was so good I really would love to get a full featured one at home).The location is at what I reckon has to be one of the busiest train stations in the world and yet you hear nothing, it is so well insulated and there is a general sense of quiet and elegance about the place. You are within a short walking distance of the Imperial Palace and its many gardens. Being at the Station you can go to all points within Japan from this station by Shinkansen and most hub lines go through it so its ideal to get around Tokyo as well.We didn’t eat here as it was the pricey side (and there are lots of cheaper options just as good nearby).The one bonus we both enjoyed is that there is an in-house onsen style baths which were clean and marvellous with varying temperature pools (hot and cold) and dry sauna (which was the hottest I had ever been in) with a wide variety of complimentary toiletries so you can turn up with nothing and its a complete service.ProsLocation to the main train station of Tokyo (if not Japan), a true sense of elegance, the fantastic room and service.

Service is always exemplary, the Concierge giving wonderful counsel on everything from viewing azaleas at Nezu Shrine to buying baseball tickets for our next visit. The Tokyo Station Hotel remains a unique gem. Location is excellent, actually in Tokyo Station, steps away from Narita Express arrival, as well as the train from Haneda.

But a major bonus is it is literally in the Tokyo Station City complex (6 levels?!). As such, the Narita Express and many of the other Tokyo Metro and JR trains stop there. Also, massive shopping and restaurant options are available. As a single traveler I booked the Palace Side Queen and it was much more than I could have expected: beautifully decorated, the ceilings must have been 12' or higher, a chandelier, foot lighting (new to me!), in room safe, a massive shower head that was a delight and even a heated toilet seat (very new to me but that was great...LOL). This was the first hotel that I have ever stayed where I could not hear any of the adjoining guests. Very quiet with little to no outside street noise either. But, aside from the stunning room, ornate lobby and well-appointed property, the staff are what makes this hotel a 5 Star. Every encounter I had with either the reception or concierge staff was very professional, friendly and genuinely interested in making sure that both my questions were answered and my needs were met. For example, as mentioned above, the Tokyo Station complex is massive spanning at least 6 levels and is a city in itself. As such, it can be a bit overwhelming trying to learn the layout and operation. The hotel staff offer to meet you when the NEX Narita Express train enters the station and guide you through the maze to the reception area (they will cheerfully provide the same service in reverse when you leave). One member of this amazing team I have to give a special nod of appreciation to is Ms. Miyuki Saito. She was a real joy to interact with and always had a very warming smile for me when I saw her. In addition, as I entered the hotel after the marathon, she insisted on taking a picture of us together (see attached). When I checked-out the next morning I was presented with a very professional greeting card with the picture included...which was very touching to say the least.

I would be catching the shinkansen to Kyoto the following day, so was looking for a hotel near Tokyo Station. This hotel is connected to Tokyo Station and spans its entire length on the station's Marunouchi side, so its convenience was perfect, as was, it would turn out, its level of service. The hotel originally opened in1915, but was extensively damaged during World War II. It had its grand reopening in 2012. The hotel offers a Meet & Greet service where, with advanced notice, someone will meet you at your train platform and car to escort you to the hotel. I did not partake of this service, as I wanted to explore the enormous Tokyo Station (especially its dining options) a bit before checking in. The Marunouchi South Gate exit is most convenient to access the hotel; there is a side entrance in the dome, and the proper entrance is just outside. Upon entering the lobby, a bellwoman (there seemed to be more bellwomen than bellmen throughout my stay) immediately jumped to attention and escorted me to the front desk, where check-in was quick and efficient. She then escorted me to my room and spent a good amount of time explaining its features. She would later even escort me to the proper ticket office to purchase my shinkansen tickets (ticket booths within the station only sell same-day tickets). The hotel seems to span the entire length of Tokyo Station on the Marunouchi side. Thus, there clearly can be lengthy walks from the central elevators and entrance to many rooms. The hotel seems to have more convenient secondary entrances that have room key access and are closed late at night.I booked the hotel's smallest and least costly accomodation, a Palace Side Queen. There seem to be very few of these rooms, which are located in the Station's 2 domes, facing outwards. My room was indeed compact, but had a very high ceiling (as do all rooms) and even a chandelier. The queen bed was pushed up against the window, so one could access the bed only from one side. For 2 people or for several nights, the room's size would perhaps be a detriment, but it was fine for me. The bathroom was actually quite sizable with a large wet-room (bath tub and adjacent multi-head shower with chair). Of all the Toto toilets I would encounter in hotels during this trip, this ond had the most features, including automatic seat lifting when I approached. The room had pajamas and slippers, a humidifier/air purifier, minibar and fridge and coffeeand tea-making accoutrements, and a cell phone with local and hotel information. One niggle: the desk had neither electrical outlets or USB ports convenient to it. I had breakfast in the lovely and soaring 4th floor space called The Atrium, open only to hotel guests. It offers an expansive buffet with many Japanese and European/Western selections--very delish.The hotel has numerous other dining and drinking establishments--French, Japanese (several options), Chinese, Italian, plus the open-all-day elegant and popular Lobby Lounge.Tokyo Station itself also has many dining options, including innumerable stalls selling bento boxes to go.

Our room was spacious and extremely well-appointed with a deep bath and rain shower. The upstairs restaurant was cozy and welcoming and the food exceptional. While not unusual to have an egg station, the creations (particularly the eggs benedict) were superb. There was a wide range of breakfast foods including both Japanese and European offerings. Entry to the hotel can be made from multiple locations in the station which ensured we did not have to wander around trying to find the correct exit. The concierge staff were brilliant, offering activities that suited both the adults and teenagers, and when we queried how to find the correct platform for a train to Osaka, walked us through the station to the correct point. All of the meals that we ate in the hotel, including room service, were delicious. There are many shops in the surrounding buildings and a small supermarket in the basement of a neighbouring building.

We stayed in one of the dome rooms at the north end of the building. The room is very nice, clean and well appointed. The walk from the lobby to the room was a bit far as expected, but to actually exit the hotel there is a side door that is much closer to the north dome. The side door closes at 1:00 am IIRC, so if you're leaving or getting back later at night you'll have to go through the lobby. It's conveniently located at Tokyo Station (obviously) which is great for transiting around the city, but in terms of just going out at night to walk around or have a drink, this location isn't going to be lively like Shinjuku/Shibuya etc. Concierge is very responsive and helpful with restaurant bookings, and they also offer a porter service that can meet you or drop you off at the NEX platform of Tokyo station when you arrive and leave.

This is very helpful as the map is slightly better than google map, you can browsing for what’s trending or found any recommendation to dine or shopping or anything, make a local or international call, and the most important thing that you can save your phone battery for something else. There’s slightly rain when we arrived at the hotel, and one of the staff running out of the hotel toward us to help carry our heavy luggage and that’s not the end, as she (yes, you read it right) them, the other staff hand her a towel to dry out our luggage. We never ever have this kind of service experience before at any other hotel at the same situation. And more of this was when we’re checked out and very early in the morning, we ask one of the staff at reception desk for a taxi, and she was checking the taxi arrival for every couple of minutes to make sure it, while we just sat comfortably in the lobby instead of standing in a freezing cold morning.

Each room also includes a “Handy” cell phone which was free to use to make calls and access the internet, which was a nice touch.(5) Location/ConvenienceThe hotel is situated right at Tokyo Station (Marunouchi side), so is fairly easy to get to, particularly if you are in transit. It also has a fairly central location in Ginza, which is surrounded by lots to do and eat. The very nearby station was great in helping us get to the Narita airport (via the Narita Express). Overall, we found the hotel to be a great home-base for exploring the city.","Boston, Massachusetts","relax_the_smile</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",15,4.0

We booked Tokyo Station Hotel(TSH) dome room for seven nights after learning in the foodie circles that their Concierge Service is one of the best, if not the best, in Tokyo.TSH’s central location is hard to beat with the extensive rail system literally at your doorstep. Ginza is within walking distance. The room was immaculate and quiet with a luxurious bed and pillows. The rain shower was addicting and difficult to get out once you get started. My wife even wanted to take home the silky one-piece pajama, unfortunately it was not for sale. Both the Japanese and Western breakfasts were delicious with varied choices and lots of seasonal fruits. We never got tired of breakfast during our stay.However, what separates TSH apart from the rest are the people. Service excellence is in their DNA. The Concierge Service headed by (Ms) M.A. Mori and associates (Ms) M. Saito and (Mr) T. Otsuka made our culinary dreams come true. We dined at Michelin starred restaurants including Ryugin, Jiro Sushi, Harutaka, Tempura Uchitsu and Le Sputnik. They also facilitated the purchase of a special Japanese knife and guided us to the nearest Pokemon store and tea house. Another stellar example, the porter packed a large cardboard box and accompanied my friend to the post office; however, since he did not have enough yen, the porter returned to the hotel to get the money to complete the transaction. In my book their service is second to none! If you love food, Tokyo—the culinary capital of the world—is the place to go and TSH is the place to stay.",,tondan47,2,5.0

It is a high-end luxurious hotel and the clientel leans toward older, more refined guests (we booked it because we had a discount through a travel club). The hotel is long and low, along the west side of the station looking out towards the Imperial Gardens, Marinouchi side. We had a dome-side room (overlooking one of the domes in the station--basically the windows opened to the inside of the station, above one of the entry domes, looking into the station. I thought it might be loud, but the windows must be thick, because we couldn't hear anything from the station. On the other hand, there's no real outside view, so it was hard to tell if it was cloudy or sunny until we went outside). The room was well-appointed, but because of it's age (built around 1915), the bed took up a lot of space and there isn't a lot of storage space in the room, but it is well-appointed, good linens, comfortable bed, great bathroom amenities and very good water pressure. The hotel, as some reviewers have noted, is long and low, so it can be quite a walk from the elevator banks to the room--it seemed like it was well over 40-50 yards, but the hotel reeks of old-school gentility and is a welcome respite from the crowded streets outside. The convenience of being in the train station cannot be overstated. The main train station is large (not as confusing as the Shinjuku station) but offers wonderful restaurants and shopping.The hotel's guests seemed to be many older Japanese couples, business people and some families. It's a quiet, respectful place. We had the breakfast package and the food is wonderful, both Japanese and western food. The staff are excellent, accommodating and unobtrusive.

We had enough space for packing our luggage. The room was on the 3rd floor facing the concourse of the station, but it was very quiet. There was a direct walkway connecting to the Marunouchi South Gate. A tourist information centre was right at the Gate, where you can buy the JR pass. It takes only 10-15 minutes to Shinjuku by the Chuo line (JR). The Shinkansen brings you to the whole country.

Starting with location, we fly into Narita, and the Narita Express takes you directly to Tokyo Station, they will even have a person with your name on a sign to guide you from train to reception if you request it. Being a JR hub and having a metro line with the next station over being the 5 metro line station Otemachi (more quickly walked to then even taking the one stop train ride) you have access to nearly all of Tokyo. You step outside from the hotel (from the quiet guest-only elevator nearest your room) and can visit any number of shops and restaurants around Marunouchi or head into Tokyo Station, that you are literally sleeping above every night, and fill your whole trip just exploring the Marunouchi and Yaesu sides of the station. With a nearby convenience store as well, you are able to stock up on drinks and snacks at the start of each day before heading out. Now, the staff was wonderful and spoke very good English. They handled everything we ever asked for, while also holding our friend's bags (that were staying at another hotel even!) when they had to check out early. The room was so comfortable and spacious, with a very conscientious cleaning staff that even organized the makeup on the vanity by size on its own towels to give just one example of the care and attention given when they clean. And even if you are prepared for running around Japan with your pocket wifi, or sim card, they have a fully functional smartphone in your room for you to take with you that can make domestic and international calls, 4G LTE, and we even downloaded Facebook and other apps we use back home, all of which get erased when you check out of the room at the end of your stay so you don't have to worry about your information. I can't even count how many times google maps, google translate, or being able to make a call to a business to make a reservation, when we were away from the hotel's concierge, helped us when our rented wifi hotspot finally gave out toward the end of each night. The bathroom was ridiculously spacious and if you wanted a hot bath, it fills in about two minutes. And if you are able, eat at the Atrium at least once. Bring down the English newspaper they have waiting outside your door, and have breakfast at the Atrium, which was the best breakfast we have ever had in Japan, with a huge selection of Western and Japanese foods. Definitely worth the price to hit at least once to experience it, but if you have the budget to eat there every morning, do it! Can't say enough about this place.

We had an absolutely fantastic experience at the hotel in June 2017, and this was our top choice for this year's trip.Before we got to the hotel, I needed to communicate with both the reservations team as well as with the concierge team on certain aspects of my stay. Emails were promptly responded to, and very helpful advice was given.This excellent service continued through our stay at the hotel, from the check-in desk, to the porter, to the housekeeping staff, and even the staff at the fitness centre. Everyone was wonderfully professional.We stayed in one of the Dome-side rooms, which gave us a view every morning and evening of the crowd going through Tokyo station - quite the spectacle. The room was a fairly good size by Tokyo standards, although the space dedicated to the bathroom (which was HUGE) seemed slightly disproportionate to the overall room. My wife and I loved the Gilchrist & Soames toiletries which were provided.The fitness centre wasn't huge, but it had sufficient machines and free weights to do a proper workout. It did get quite busy in the mornings we were there though (I think non-hotel guests are allowed to be members, so perhaps it was a pre-office workout for some), so scheduling your workouts off-peak might be a good idea. The trainers were very helpful in explaining some of the more unusual machines, and made sure all the equipment was wiped down after use (even if the users themselves wipe the equipment down).The bath area was also perfectly adequate, with two hot baths (of different temperatures), a cold bath, and a sauna room.While the building itself is beautiful, well-maintained, well-located and full of history and character, what really made our stay an excellent one was the hotel staff.Special mention must be made of the excellent service we received from the Reservations Manager, Ms Sekine, who patiently answered my many emails pre-arrival. And of course, our stay was made extra special because of the efforts of the (legendary) Chief Concierge, Ms Mori, and Concierge team members, Ms Saito and Mr Otsuka. They were able get us into some of the best restaurants in Tokyo, and their reputation for being able to do so is well-deserved.We return to the Tokyo Station Hotel in December, this time with family, and cannot wait to stay there again.","Singapore, Singapore","dthtan01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",9,5.0

It looked beautiful, and I had read about the exceptional service. But after our recent two night stay there last week, I left disappointed.On the plus side, the hotel is in the perfect location in terms of proximity to the train station (connected). And the area around the station is just beautiful. You can easily walk to the Imperial Palace or hop on the metro to explore the city. And the hotel is definitely beautiful - from the outside and the public spaces. But that's where the good impression ended for me.We were given room 2001 which was the farthest room from the lobby. So far it had it's own entrance. It felt like we were handed the keys to a private apartment rather than feeling like a luxurious hotel stay. While the room was spacious, it felt dark and a bit tired. And for the price we were paying, I was surprised that certain things weren't offered, such as nightly turn down or access to the fitness facilities (you have to pay an extra fee). And on our first day, we somehow inadvertently turned on a do not disturb button, so when we returned to our room we discovered it had not been made up. No one tried to contact us. We came back to a note that informed us if we wanted housekeeping we needed to let them know before 3pm. Not helpful when you return at 6. And with no turn down, it meant we had no room cleaning or freshening of towels at all over our 2 night stay. And no one seemed to notice or care to help us fix this. While the staff were all polite and friendly, we didn't experience the service standard you would expect at a hotel of this calibre. People were helpful, but no one went out of their way to help us sort out plans when we needed help. The whole stay felt really impersonal to me. And part of the reason we choose to stay at hotels vs rent apartments is because that service element really goes a long way when you are in a foreign country.In the end, I guess it's all about expectations. And perhaps mine were just a bit too high.If you are looking for a nice hotel in close proximity to the train station and don't mind paying for the location, then this will probably do the trick. But if you are looking for a bit more then perhaps you want to explore other options.","Toronto, Canada","TorontoTravelGirl70</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",23,3.0

We travel often but for whatever reason it was a challenge to decide on lodging for Tokyo. So glad we discovered Tokyo Station Hotel (TSH). Some internet sites advise to stay at a tourist area for the first time like Shinjuku. We could disagree more as TSH was an oasis for us in this busy city. Centrally located at Tokyo train station we could easily access any district around Tokyo with ease. The best part was coming home to a boutique hotel like TSH where the team is happy welcoming you back home and interested how your day went. We enjoy the intimate connections especially with the concierge team of Marie Antoinette, Miyuki Saito, and Mr. Tomorino among others. They make relationships so that there recommendations were spot on. The hotel is impeccable form the customer service to the design and architectural details. The team attire was clean and professional. What was always nice was to see each team member step up or out to acknowledge their guest. As a leadership guru I find that well coached. Kudos. Location, location, location. Although not in the heart of the busy tourist area we find an advantage to be able to leave it at the end of the day. TSH is located in a beautiful plaza in the Chiyoda area. It seems to be financial or downtown center that was, of course, impeccable. The advantage here was we got to observe the locals moving about, where they ate and shopped. There two “twin towers” they call them loaded with as fancy shops as you need, all the delicious dining you’d ever want. It was nice to see where the locals went like having a drink at a local watering hole. The train station hotel has fantastic ramen in Ramen Street. You can’t miss breakfast in the Atrium. TSH not only has the five star look but what makes a great hotel an exceptional one are the ones you remember by the connections or relationships you make with the hotel staff. In other words they make you feel at home and want to return. You can’t go wrong.

Having stayed there previously in a totally quiet room, I knew that even though this hotel is located in the station, I didn't need to hear the Ka Kung, Ka Kung of trains all night. We rang the next morning and were moved to another quiet room. My mother was upgraded to an amazing suite!

But this hotel is rated amongst the top 3 hotels in Tokyo for a good reason, in fact, many good reasons. Value: I've rated it 4/5 only because of the size of the room, but it really is negligible, with the other perks the hotel is offering and the fact that hotel rooms are generally smaller sized in Japan. For the price you are paying, you'll be getting a rich heritage (hotel opened in 1915), utmost convenience, superb service, tip-top quality, great comfort and an unforgettable experience like no other.Location: Not only is this hotel located at the heart of Tokyo, it is also located directly above the railway station JR Tokyo Station Marunouchi. What more can I say?Sleep Quality: What the room lacks in size, it makes it up with the room's high ceiling, luxurious finishing and an extremely comfortable 8.25 inch pocket coil Simmons Bed. And don't worry, you won't hear any buzz from the railway station.Rooms: Rooms may seem small at first, but once you take in all the finer details, luxurious finishing and the unique/beautiful window view (depending on which room you've booked), you'll easily find the room a beauty.Cleanliness: Japanese standard, tip-top.Service: Language shouldn't be a barrier here as majority of the staff can converse in decent English. Service, as expected, is Japanese standard and tip-top as well. Just remember to do your due diligence and research about the country before going over. Tipping is not a practice in Japan and may be perceived as an insult if you try to do so. If you wish to show appreciation, just smile and do a sincere half-bow :) Breakfast: Do get your room with breakfast! The buffet breakfast is one of the hotel's many strengths. Approximately 110 food items to choose from, ranging from European to Japanese cuisine. It is heaven on earth literally before you even start exploring Tokyo's streets.","Singapore, Singapore","VLuo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",18,5.0

I chose here because I was worried about trying to figure out transportation after such a long flight and this seemed ideal to just stay at the train station. That was a very good call as we had no problem following the signs in the train station to the hotel. The staff was extremely helpful upon check-in as I had questions about activities that evening in Tokyo and obtaining a reservation/ticket for our JR rail pass for our early morning train out of the station. They had someone walk our luggage with us to our room, which was a very long walk at the other end of the check-in office. When I asked him about where to go to get the train ticket he asked me where I was going, wrote it down and said he would give it to someone to be able to take us there in the morning. He told us when to be downstairs to check out in order to give us enough time to get the reservation and make the train. Sure enough, the next morning at check-out they had someone waiting for us to take us and our luggage to the ticket counter in the train station where they waited for us to get our reservation. He then continued to walk us and our luggage through the train station to the exact spot where we needed to wait in line for our specific train car. We were so grateful for this as I'm pretty sure we would never have figured it out on our own or would have at least not made it in time as it was a very long walk with lots of turns, stairs, people, and confusion. The hotel also let me store a large piece of luggage with them as the lockers in the train station were only good for 3 days and I wanted to store a piece of luggage for 5 days while we traveled other parts of Japan before we'd be back in Tokyo to fly to our next destination. Picking up the luggage on the way back 5 days later was no issue and no charge. I had also identified a restaurant that I wanted to try and a animal cafe. The concierge made reservations for us at the restaurant, gave us a map and wrote down on Japanese each of the locations we were going to so we'd have something to show the taxi drivers. He also walked us out to the taxi driver and told him where to take us for our first stop. The room was a bit small but perfectly fine for the short time we were there. The ceilings were very tall which helped make it feel larger. The shower room, fancy toilet, and bathroom amenities were excellent. The towels were super soft thick, soft, and fluffy. They provide a free cell phone in the room for you to use to get around while there if you want (we didn't need to use it as I used my own cell). We stayed above one of the entrances of the station and watched the people coming and going through the train station turnstiles. I was worried nice would be a problem at night but it wasn't as the station closes at a certain time. The only thing we struggled with were the lights - we couldn't figure out how to turn them off at night so we ended up just taking the key card out of the holder by the door. As we were checking the room the next morning to make sure we didn't leave anything, we found all the light controls at the bedside. Would have been nice if that was explained to us when we were dropped in our room but at least we learned for all the subsequent hotels we stayed at (the light controls were all the same in all of the hotels we stayed at in Japan).

The experience and hotel were amazing and well worth the cost. It was so easy to get to it from Tokyo Disney and then even easier to get to our train back to Narita airport.We (my son and I) stayed two nights in a Dome view room. So interesting to see people come and go to the train station and unlike any hotel room view I've had before. The room size was perfect for the two of us. There was a nice sitting area with a desk (my son used it for work a few times), large bathroom, and extra area for the closet and fridge. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet one morning and were wowed with the selection of food. So nice to relax over coffee in such an elegant room.Two biggest pluses for me and why I would book a return stay were the use of a smart phone while we were there and the courteous staff. As we were checking out I asked how to navigate the train station. They provided us with a bell cap (hope that is the correct term) who guided us through the ticket purchasing process and walked us right to our ""gate"". In retrospect, I""m not sure how long it would have taken us to figure out what she knew and did for us.Yes, I'm sure with research we could have found a cheaper room, but the elegance of the hotel -- inside and out -- was perfect for our first visit to Japan.","Clifton Park, New York, Usa","cheryl8here</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clifton Park, New York, Usa</strong>",6,5.0

I also needed a doctor while I was there - was referred to a terrible clinic and given fairly substandard directions on how to get there.We called down to the lobby lounge to see if we could get reservations for lunch/tea on the day we left. They told us that they don't take reservations but we could just walk in. They didn't bother to tell us that we would have to wait in line for over 45 minutes. We tried to get cocktails at the bar around 10 pm on a Monday night. We were told there were no seats and we were shuffled to a table in an adjacent room, but they never offered to seat us in the bar once seats were available. On the upside, the rooms and bathrooms are clean and beds are comfortable. The hotel is not at all noisy despite location above the station. For the price, there are much better places to stay for service.","San Diego, California","travelvixen9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",84,3.0

It is a well known location so it’s always easy to return to by train, subway or taxi. The hotel itself it beautiful and the staff is amazing!! The concierge is wonderful and so detail oriented. She gave us very precise directions including platform levels we should go to to catch trains. She even walked us over to Tokyo Station (right next door) and guided us through buying a train pass!! She was absolutely correct; trains are the easiest and fastest way to travel around Tokyo. (Very safe and extremely clean. Americans will be happily surprised!) All of the hotel staff are so professional and helpful. I can’t say enough good things about them! Please book the buffet with your room. I usually am not a fan of buffets and prefer meals made to order but this buffet was amazing. Both western foods and full Japenese breakfast. The fresh squeezed fruit juices are wonderful. I liked that small amounts of each dish were put out and replaced immediately as needed. I believe there are 110 food items including made to order egg dishes. The atrium where breakfast is served is beautiful and relaxing. I also recommend the Oak Bar at the hotel. Nice, quiet clubby feel with fun cocktails. We had a lovely evening there chatting with some fellow Americans. Lastly, directly behind the hotel is an amazing department store. I can’t remember the name of it but is begins with a D.

Location, location, location. Tokyo Station Hotel (TSH) is close to everything in this sprawling city. It’s literally directly above central train and subway stops, across from the Imperial Palace, next door to the swanky Ginza district and great shops, restaurants and bars are already within the building itself. Many flock from all over the city to enjoy the sophisticated Café and charming little bar upstairs, two stops we could resist making ourselves – and we were so glad we did.Compared to other luxury accommodations in Tokyo (TSH being a member of “Small Luxury Hotels of the World”), the price is quite competitive and accommodations, impressive. The room was decorated beautifully and relatively large, with a unique view of the station. The King bed was comfortable, with clean, modern linens. The bathroom was spacious and kitted out in royal fashion (including rainfall and handheld shower, large bath, along with separate vanity and toilet areas). And the service was nothing short of outstanding! Did I mention the service? Restaurant bookings in Japan are difficult to make from abroad. As such, we enlisted our concierge to get us into a Michelin starred restaurant, in advance of our trip. He not only obliged, but also helped us get into a hard-to-book Sapporo restaurant on another league of our stay. The same fellow helped us with train directions for an early morning activity we had in the suburbs. It was as if we had a personal assistant at the ready – all for a smile and a simple 'Arigato'. We mustn’t forget the trouble we had with Wi-Fi, where they promptly sent someone up to our room to sort the issue out. Of course, we thanked them profusely and rewarded them sufficiently for their efforts.Another compelling reason to consider TSH is its impressive history, having been around since 1915. Listed as an “Important Culture Property of Japan”, it has survived earthquakes and wars, and lived to tell the tale. Historic hotels are rare as hen’s teeth in Japan, so it’s wonderful to stay somewhere that has more to offer than sleek surroundings, and reams of glass and steel.TSH was a big splurge for us, but this was the right choice in this terribly frenetic location. We needed an oasis of calm in the fast-paced hustle and bustle of Tokyo. We hail from Toronto, but Tokyo has 10 times the population, so it’s important to have an easy escape from it all, at the end of the day. The route home was a cinch from anywhere in the city – something critical during your stay in this not-so-easy-to-navigate place (no street names in Tokyo). We were thrilled we made the right choice for myriad reasons and would heartily recommend Tokyo Station Hotel to anyone who can afford to treat themselves to a bit of sanity and indulgence, during their stay.","Toronto, Canada","CKimoff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",47,5.0

Hotels located in grand old stations are fascinating, often exquisite and elegant, with a twist of melancholy.Located in the old Tokyo Station (built in 1914 and located in Marunouchi, near Ginza), the Tokyo Station Hotel is indeed beautiful and luxurious. The rooms have very high ceilings and are perfectly quiet, even though there are no high floors. There is free wifi, a gym (you will need to pay extra for it), and the service is considerate and very helpful. The reason why I’m not giving it full ratings is the lack of warmth. It is not a hotel where I would stay for a longer period of time because it would never feel like home. For a one night stay, however, it was a beautiful experience.

I am a sushi lover so every time I come to Tokyo, I try to secure reservations at Michelin three-star sushi restaurants. During my previous visit, Mrs. Mori was able to book me into Sukiyabashi Jiro, and during this visit, she was able to get me a reservation at Sushi Yoshitake, before they even started taking reservations. The concierge at the Tokyo Station Hotel did what other five star hotels couldn’t and that was why I decided to return. Both restaurants were beyond amazing. The hotel remains in excellent standing, immaculate in every corner and the service from all the staff were amazing. In addition, I did try out the spa facilities downstairs, they do require a 2000 YEN charge but it was reasonable as the facilities were very well kept.

The setting for breakfast in the atrium is simply beautiful, a fantastic space with a breakfast to match. Both Japanese and European on offer and all to the highest order. The location is also second to none.What wasn’t up to scratch for an SLH hotel was the size of the room, we arrived from London with 2 large cases and there wasn’t enough space to open them both at the same time. Also the tiny standard double (I’m 196cm tall) was pushed into a corner of the room which meant I had to shimmy to the bottom of the bed, climb over the chair, avoid the glass table and then stumble into the bathroom. No mean feat in the middle of the night!The hotel also advertises that it has a spa and fitness center however this is not an amenity thats free as you would expect of a hotel of this class,to use the spa you need to pay ¥2000 and for the fitness center ¥1000.That’s me done, I’m off to have my first decent nights sleep since I’ve been in Japan in a lovely king size bed that’s in the middle of a room!","London, United Kingdom","Supertedbaker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",63,3.0

The style of the room is great, the bathroom is huge and well stocked with amenities, however the room is realistically the smallest hotel room I’ve ever stayed in. The double bed was pressed up against the window with an armchair at the end, so only one person could actually get in to bed from the side, we had to move the chair and climb in from the bottom of the bed. We had 2 suitcases, since we were on a 2 week holiday travelling around japan, and we struggled to even stand both suitcases up and move around them to the bathroom, the only way to open them was to put them on the bed!On our last morning we had some time before our train so went to use the gym and spa/bath area. We were surprised to hear that the gym was 1,000 JPY and the relaxation spa area (no treatments just the sauna etc) was 2,000JPY for guests. My past experience is that when paying for a 4-5 star hotel that advertises a gym etc, that’s normally included in the price (not treatments of course, but pool or gym or sauna/bath).

LocationIt’s attached next to Tokyo Station which boasts a dizzying number of lines. It’s easy to shoot to Narita on the Narita Express, or pretty much any part of Tokyo or even Japan. We jumped on the Shinkansen to Osaka on our last trip and headed to Karuizawa on this trip.2. RoomsThe rooms are very well appointed with one of the best fittings I’ve seen, even by five star standards. The upkeep is impeccable and the rooms still look flawless with every visit. Beds are comfy and I love the bathrooms. Perfectly designed. I’m also really impressed that they take care of kids even though this is such a business oriented hotel - kids slippers, pajamas and even Shinkansen themed cups and special toiletries for the little ones. 3. ServiceThe service is really unparalleled and consistent here. We have had impeccable service with every visit here with so much thought and attention to detail. Even though this is a well appointed business hotel, they have treated our kids with such warmth and kindness.We have had the hotel staff assist me and my family all the way down to the train platform and they have been very kind to my family. A special shout out to Ms. Utsumi and Mr. Takizawa for helping us catch our Narita Express last year, and to Ms. Mizuochi who gave us such wonderful and warm service in the Atrium every day during breakfast this time round - my kids adore her.4. The food (particularly the breakfast)The breakfast at the Tokyo Station Hotel is something which draws us back. It’s probably the best breakfast we have had at a hotel. The quality of the food and the freshness of the ingredients is unparallel! The only let down was the choice for room service - somewhat limited but we still had a nice lobster dinner in the room.A big recommendation for this one - an absolute gem.","Singapore, Singapore","darre77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",40,5.0

As far as those things are concerned, I can honestly say that they do better than typical las vegas hotels. the room is very ""atypical Japanese hotel room"" - spacious, elegant and really expensive and quality materials. I'm 175lbs 5'9'' so if you are bigger than me, you may think otherwise. My room overlooked the tokyo station Marunouchi south gate exit. The entrance to the hotel is on the right side as you exit the ticket purchasing area. (don't go outside, it is in the same hall, on the right side. You will see the ""tokyo station hotel"" sign in english. You can sometimes hear the sounds from the train station but overall not bothersome. Atrium buffet (4th floor) was nice too. They have 2 different sections for the breakfast, western style and japanese style. the servers are very polite and ask for my needs time to time. They took away my used silverware and plates quickly (perhaps it was not crowded). Food was above average and probably not justified by ~$40 price tag. But everything spoke elegance and opulent. What impressed me the most is the exercise room. I have never been to a hotel with so many people working out (no wonder japanese people are healthy overall). They have top of the line equipment: O2 chamber, legit vibration plate, and 2-3 staff always attentive to your needs. Yes it does cost ~$10 but it's worth a visit if you are into exercising regularly. Overall my stay at the tokyo station was unforgettable.

Glamorous Ginza with Tokyo's most elegant shopping district, glorious restaurants and the Kabuki theater is just a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. The lovely hotel rooms were tastefully decorated with heavenly bathrooms and fresh pressed pajamas supplied daily. I rarely eat breakfast in my hotels, but Tokyo Station's is not to be missed with oodles of delectable Japanese and Western treats. I am always skeptical about using concierges, but Head Concierge Marie Mori and Concierge Tomonori Otsuka treated us as though we were privileged guests in their homes. I can't say enough about their professionalism, attentive service and concern for our well being. I started emailing the concierge desk a couple months before my arrival and their prompt helpful responses made the difference in our trip. One night when our taxi couldn't find our restaurant and dropped us off on the sidewalk, Marie called the restaurant to make sure we would find the door and confirmed that we had safely arrived. No request was too big or small.....they made it happen. The entire hotel staff were also gracious and helpful.Be sure to make it to one of the depachikas, the sophisticated, yummy food halls in the basements of Tokyo's famous, high-end department stores. Scores of offerings of chocolates, pastries, ice cream, salads, japanese delicacies, wine & sake and just about anything else you'd want to eat are on display. My Favorite is at Ginza 6, Tokyo's newest, fancy department store that just opened this year. Another great shop within Ginza 6 is the Cibone store showcasing mostly Japanese made housewares that you can't live without. I had so many great meals in Tokyo, but the can't miss is Michelin one star Motoyoshi. Reserve early to get one of the eight seats in this tiny restaurant and savor one of the omakase Tempura menus cooked in front of you!Book your trip to Tokyo now and don't even consider staying anywhere else!",San Francisco,"LSChampagne</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco</strong>",19,5.0

First and foremost everyone at the hotel was wonderful with helping us prior to our arrival. That said one person in particular had gone truly above and beyond what I have seen or consider 5 star service.The person I speak of is Ms. Marie Antoinette Mori, the Chief Concierge.I would consider myself very well traveled, as with over 30 years and 150+ countries visited while staying in 4 or 5 star hotels (where applicable), I know a thing or two about good service versus exceptional service. In my travels to Tokyo I have stayed at The Park Hyatt, The Mandarin and the Aman. I can say with complete certainty that although I felt very taken care of in these establishments, never once did I receive the type of personal attention I did from Ms. Mori and her team in the Hotel. She without question went above and beyond for us in so many ways with regard to reservations, advice and guidance on how to proceed with our booking. I really can not fathom how much effort she dedicated to our requests for when I was at the other hotels I mentioned, it could not be helped that we always felt like we would be taken care of when they could get to us. At the Tokyo Station Hotel we always knew we would be taken care of and Ms. Mori, Tomo and team were the reason for this. Not once did we ever feel like we were part of a que or that we would be gotten to ""in due time"". Her updates and follow through were consistently amazing. So again I state the obvious in that she is by far the best concierge I have ever had the privilege of working with during my travels. I truly hope the hotel recognizes the superior value that she brings. I would also add that if anything Ms. Mori is the standard by all staff/team members of hotels should be compared to. In summary we were lucky we chose the Tokyo Station Hotel, them having such a wonderful team member under their watch and we truly are looking forward to staying again soon.",Endurance99,"Endurance99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Endurance99</strong>",165,5.0

We had a 24-hour travel day coming from Cleveland, Ohio. When had looked into taking a private car from Narita to the hotel because of the length of our travels, but it was cost prohibitive and we opted instead for the train. We knew that the hotel was located at/near the train station, but after a really long travel day, we were absolutely thrilled to see an actual internal door from the train station into the lobby of the hotel. We had arrived! High fives everywhere! As in many hotels, hostesses guide you to your room when you arrive. The hallways are the longest hallways I have seen in my entire life! It makes sense when you see the hotel as it is a very long building. Our room had a view out to the front plaza. Once we figured out the elevators and small lobbies that are midway through the building allow you access both as an entrance and exit to the hotel, it made the walk easier. We ordered room service one night and it was prompt and delicious. The rooms (at least ours) is small, but it is very well appointed. It was a little tricky trying to figure out where to put two large suitcases, and we did have to move one of them around both in the morning and again in the evening. I would prefer to eliminate the desk to make room for another suitcase. The bathroom is really big, and I was very excited about the shower. It was large, and had a multiple different types of shower heads (I liked the rainfall version from the ceiling), and it was one of the best bathrooms I have ever had at a hotel. So, that made up for the size of the room in my book. With all that being said, the highlight of the hotel was the customer service, and we are still talking about it. Most specifically, I had visited Mr. Tomonori Otsuka at the concierge desk with two questions. One... I wanted to go to a hibachi restaurant. He set us up with reservations of our choosing at a restaurant in the Ginza district for that evening. Secondly, and most impressive, Mr. Otsuka had emailed me with a confirmation about our dinner reservation, which meant that I had his email address. The next day, my husband and I were touring Tokyo and we had questions about something unrelated to that dinner reservation. We had purchased baseball tickets to see the Tokyo Yukalt Swallows baseball team, and were concerned about the rain, the refund policy and whether or not the game would be played. I wrote him a note to ask one simple question. That turned into him sending me updates throughout the day about the status of the game. Luckily, the game was played (yay!), but the experience was made so much better by knowing that someone was thinking about us, and making sure we had the most updated information. Top notch hotel... recommend it highly!","Cleveland, Ohio","tracyamarek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cleveland, Ohio</strong>",49,5.0

I stayed here only for one night, but I wish I had stayed for more. The rooms are impeccable. I stayed in a normal double room and it was more than sufficient. Maybe, a bit on the smalll side though, but hotel rooms in Tokyo are rather small if you compare to other cities. Everything is neat and tidy and the bathroom is one of the best I have ever come along, perfect !. The breakfast area is really good and the variety is humongous. You will get everything you can imagine and if you can't find something that you like, they can probably get it for you. Just ask them. This is also one off the things that this hotel do so much better than other hotels- SERVICE. If you have a request or a problem with something- they fix it. I had a problem with a delivery of a portable router that I had ordered a few weeks ahead. So I talked to the concierge and she immediately rang the delivery company. 45 minutes later I had my package delivered to my room. This is what I call efficiency. The only thing I maybe have something to complain about is. If you get a room in the far end off the hotel, you will spend some time walking to and back from the lobby. Endless corridores!. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who appreciate tranquil sleep, perfekt service and super breakfast.

Booked primarily for location and convenience (we were catching a Shinkansen the following morning) we were not expecting the Tokyo Station Hotel to be as nice as it was. SLH hotels rarely disappoint to be fair but in a city of countless iconic, uber sleek and luxurious high rises, can a 3 story property attached a train station really cut it? In a word, yes.It is certainly luxurious and our duplex room (we were upgraded as SLH members) was probably bigger than most Tokyo apartments. Everything that could be (including curtains and blinds) was electric as you would expect and we had a month's supply of Bulgari toiletries in the gorgeous bathroom but the room (and whole hotel) manages to exude genuine old world charm thanks to the meticulous restoration of the original building. It is this effortless combination of old and modern that gives the Tokyo Station Hotel a fairly unique charm. The location is fantastic too. Not just for the station itself but Ginza with its wealth of eating and shopping options and the Imperial Palace all within a comfortable stroll. We've stayed at the Mandarin Oriental, Peninsula and Park Hyatt in Tokyo on previous trips to Tokyo and surprisingly, this gives them all a run for their money in many ways. If anything lets it down it's probably the bars, neither of which are places you'd probably want to spend too much time in (compared to the eye-popping, cloud-touching effort at the Mandarin Oriental for example) but with Ginza on your doorstep you are not short of alternatives that are kinder on your wallet too.

We did our sight seeing via the train system, which is very easy to use.

And our decisions were absolutely right. The pleasant impressions just right from the start we arrived at the hotel. The exterior is beautiful (especially at night, very romantic), the front desk was very helpful and so polite. The whole lobby teams are amazingly friendly. The lounge, the hall and the room are amazingly beautiful and super comfy and the privacy is excellent. You don't even have to ask me about the foods, they are extremely delectable. You can even arrange your own Japanese breakfast (well at least it's my first experience to have my own selections). The manager at breakfast was very helpful, he passionately tried to explain how i can explore this historic hotel's building as mentioned by the front desk guy when we're check-in as well. I can tell, their services are second to none, one of the best for me. At last but not least is the location and access. You don't have to come out of the hotel building to get into the Tokyo station, you get your own access as they're technically in the same building.

Comfortable beds, very quiet rooms, gorgeous bathrooms with rain shower heads and fully automated toilets (as seems customary in Japan).Breakfast is amazing with a large number of ulta high quality Japanese and Western food choices/options. Coffee and tea were excellent and service was good. Minor issue being that the coffee is not proactively refilled quickly enough, so we had to ask for coffee and/or tea over and over which made us feel bothersome. Some of the staff also do not have great command of English, so communication could be choppy at times, although I thought this added to the overall feel of the place.Lastly, as far as location goes, this hotel is in PERFECT location especially if you take the Narita Express to get to downtown Tokyo. The NEX will stop right underneath the hotel, so even with luggage, it was easy enough to get to the hotel with minimal hassle. The hotel also offers a free ""greet"" service at the platform where an employee will meet you at the patform and help you with your bags. That is a service I did not utilize but wish I had.To take the subway, other statons are frequently more convenient to avoid having to change trains, but all of them are within 5 minutes walk, so still incredibly convenient.Overall, I could not have been happier with our stay and will return to stay here next time I am in Tokyo.","Austin, TX","Steffen P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, TX</strong>",81,5.0

Note: it is generally best to buy your rail pass in the US.In particular we want to thank Concierge Marie Antoinette (really) who was so helpful throughout our 5 night stay.

One of a tiny handful of properties in Japan that date back to the late 19th or early 20th century and have that Victorian feel. The rooms have high ceilings and tall windows. The location is perfect for both a jet lagged stroll around the grounds of the nearby Imperial Palace Gardens and it's a short hop downstairs to the Shinkansen to Kyoto. The breakfast buffet is good value for Japan too.The hotel suffers from being at the crossroads. It is incredibly busy with large crowds for checkin and check out.

I had it in my head that the pictures online would of course be way better than what it actually was. That idea started to change when we entered the hotel from Tokyo station south exit, and we came across the beautiful bar/lounge area next to the reception area. There was quite a line to get in there, so obviously very popular. We kept going along the corridor until we came to the gorgeous reception area. We were greeted with beautiful beaming smiles from all the staff, and a genuine friendliness. We were escorted to our room, and shown all the amenities within. We had a palace side superior room - beautiful! Ample space, including a little sitting area, with seating for 3 and coffee table. Also, a lovely desk next to the TV for any work you need to do. Free wifi of course. Lovely comfortable bed. Safe. 4 free waters in the minibar fridge good to take with us on our sight seeing walks around Tokyo. There was a note saying there may be noise from construction out on the street in the mornings, but we heard nothing. The room is so well sound proofed. The bathroom is huge and gorgeous, complete with your option of using the rain shower from above, or the shower on the rail, with choice of varying functions, which meant varying water pressure to please everyone (let's hope!). The bath tub is large and great for soaking in after a hard day of walking, or doing nothing:) Heaps of toiletries included, above and beyond the usual. Watch out for the Japanese toilet if you have a little one. My 10 year old was scared of it for the first 2 days, and I had to stand outside so she felt safe! But it's great. You don't have to touch it at all. The lid lifts as you enter, the seat is warmed (!), it flushes itself once you stand up, and closes the lid about a minute later. I want one! If you are into bidet stuff, it had that too.Regarding other reviews about the long hallways, yes, if that is a problem for you, request one closer to the lifts. It wasn't a problem for us. There are directions to reception or rooms on the walls, so it's not like you would get lost, unless you're not paying attention, or forgot your room number. Even those long hallways and corridors are beautiful, and perfectly maintained/cleaned. Check out the photos on the walls every so often as well, of varying eras of the hotel, and stages of reconstruction after the big earthquake many, many years ago, and then after WW2. Its latest refurb was done in 2012, and has been done in a classic, contemporary feel that is perfect for the exterior architecture. In regards to location, it is absolutely perfect. Walking distance to Ginza or the Imperial Palace and gardens. Right above Tokyo's biggest train station means easy access to everywhere. The area feels very safe. The workers of the area are so impeccably dressed it is jaw dropping. Needless to say, we would definately stay here again.","Brisbane, Australia","bunny2669</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",40,5.0

Why should you have to pay to use the gym - which only opens at 7:00AM - and requires you to find another elevator?

Why is there not an outlet anywhere close to the desk where you can plug in the computer? Why is there a fancy coffee machine that does not work?

In a great location above Tokyo Station, and given that most of your travel around Tokyo is by train it was ideal. No train noise could be heard in my room, I might add. We were met by staff at the station on arrival and taken to the correct platform on departure. The staff were exceptionally polite and no request was an issue for them. My room was beautifully appointed with a fantastic bathroom full of natural light, seperate shower, bath and toilet, and had every woman's necessity, a magnifying mirror. There were only two things I might mention, the front of the hotel is undergoing landscaping, but this wasn't an issue for access, more aesthetics. And there was a problem getting a drink at the hotel bars, there seemed to be a weird booking system, despite what the front desk said. A special thanks has to go to the wonderful Marie Antoinette, the Concierge, for whom nothing was too hard, she took initiative when making bookings for us, and was just a particularly pleasant person. One final thing, my friend stayed there for one night a week later and the type of pillow she had used previously was waiting for her on her bed! Thankyou Marie Antoinette for a wonderful stay.

It's right at the Tokyo Station and if you have limited time, it's a great starting point to the city. They also have pick up and drop off service which was just amazing. Someone will meet you at the platform (you have to contact them 2 days prior and you have to be taking one of the fast trains to use this service) and walk you to the hotel. At the end of your stay, you can also ask to be walked to your train's platform. It may not seem like much, but Tokyo Station is a humongous maze and if your time is limited it's just a fabulous service. The concierge was also excellent in booking us a dinner reservations and upgraded our room to celebrate a special occasion. They even left us a complimentary dessert in our room! The room itself was very spacious and the bed was very comfortable. The washroom was quite luxurious and we were very happy with everything.My only complaint about this hotel is regarding their fitness centre. First of all, they charge 1000 yen per day to use it. For a hotel that already charges so much per night, it's kind of tacky. Secondly, there are some really odd and rigid rules here. They tried to get us to pay 500 yen to use their ""workout clothes"" including shoes. We declined because we had our own, but when I entered the change room she tried to take away my shoes. I explained to her they were my workout shoes, she tried to tell me I wasn't allowed to wear ""outside shoes"" into the gym and wanted me to pay the 500 yen to wear their ""indoor shoes"". It was so bizarre. I told her they were what I wear to the gym and that they were clean, but she insisted on scrubbing my shoes with a towel before reluctantly agreeing to let me wear them. Once I got into the gym, there was someone standing next to me the whole time and pressing the screen for me while I was working out. I wasn't sure if she was there to help me or supervise me. My husband also had a guy stand next to him while lifting weights and he would sporadically inform him of random rules. We both felt so restrained that we left in 20min. We've been to hundreds of gyms around the world and this was just the oddest experience. In the change room too, there were random staff just standing there while people were changing. Again, I'm not sure if they were there to help us or make sure we didn't break any rules. I had a feeling it was the latter. The spa was really nice though. Overall, it was a nice hotel, but too rigid and rules need to be updated for this century. ","Vancouver, Canada","Ingri-ingri</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",174,4.0

The hotel is beautifully appointed and very conveniently located (its in a train station for crying out loud) but my hotel room was probably a good 10 minute walk down a never ending array of hallways from the entrance/elevator and overlooked a construction area. The decor is modern and plush but the food was just abysmal. We ordered a japanese breakfast in room service for over $120 and we literally rolled the cart back out to the hallway the way it came because the food was just unpalatable. The same could be said about the dinner we had our first night at the Italian restaurant on the property, we would have been better off eating canned spaghetti. The staff was polite but nothing more, and considering how polite and hospitable the locals have been during all my trips to japan they really fell short. I would not stay here again. The 3 stars( a true 3.5 star experience) are for the actual decor/design of the hotel and the amazingly convenient location that is worth gold in Tokyo, but service, room view of a contraction zone, location of room so far from elevator (5-7 minute walk from elevator to room door), and both room service and the restaurant providing horrible meals made this a hotel I could not recommend moving forward.","Los Angeles, California","KatC842</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",2,3.0

They even offered suggestions/alternatives when I had some concerns about seating availability. I really appreciated all their assistance and everything went perfectly. I did wish that they had provided me with the directions to the restaurants before I had to ask. It's a very minor quibble but perhaps it was due to having had such service from the nearby Four Seasons Tokyo. When I stayed with them and had restaurant reservations made, the hotel provided me with a location map and restaurant details etc upon my check-in.Our train from Narita experienced very severe delay and so by the time we arrived, 2 of our rooms were available to check-in. The room was very much as I had remembered it, cosy and comfortable with all the usual amenities. The bed was very much to my liking and the complimentary wifi very fast. The excellent location makes it very easy to access the train lines and I was able to travel from the hotel to the station exits without having to expose myself to the elements. Upon our departure, the hotel was also able to assist us in transporting our luggage all the way down to the Narita Express platform. Really helped my family a lot as we had quite a few heavy suitcases. Overall, I'd highly recommend The Tokyo Station Hotel for its excellent service, lovely property and unbeatable location.

The general manager's personal note and little gifts like Bvlgari chocolates and traditional Japanese red bean cakes inside the room also made a huge difference. Among these, I wish to personally commend the male middle age concierge (who I unfortunately forgot to take his name). He was very professional while providing me advice for my trip, and always took care of little details to ensure my trip is perfect. The hotel is perfectly located in the beautiful Tokyo Station which is a tourist attraction by itself. As it is located in the Tokyo Station, you can easily travel to places like Shinjuku or Shibuya, or out of Tokyo (this is a huge plus point since I needed to travel to Yokohama, Kyoto and so on). It is also located near the Imperial Palace which is also a major attraction. The hotel has a lot of famous restaurants located within, and the toiletries are the branded Gilbert and Soames. I will definitely come back for my next stay and I will strongly recommend this best Tokyo hotel to everyone. Last but not least, the general manager sent us off personally during my last day.

The bathrooms are wonderful with a delightful shower and tub, plus a heated seat toilet/bidet! We had never been to Tokyo and were a little apprehensive about getting around, but the Concierge, Tomonori Otsuka, relieved us of that. We was wonderful with perfect English. Arranged a great tour guide for a day, made restaurant recommendations, and drew multiple maps and instructions plus answered all our questions on local customs such as tipping. He even followed up with email confirmations. The hotel sits on tops of a gigantic train connection probably 4-6 stories deep. There are multiple shops and restaurants. Just across from the hotel are high rise buildings that are also full of restaurants and shops. You could never leave the area for days. It is also a very short walk to the Imperial Palace and gardens. Cabs are always available and reasonably priced. At one point, Tomonori came out with us to explain to our taxi where we wanted to go. On departure, Tomonori arranged for two assistants to take us and our bags to the platform for the airport express train. Thank goodness. It was numerous escalators and 2 elevators away. We would have been lost for hours. The hotel has two very nice bars (Oak Bar the nicest, smoking but didn't bother us), but they are hidden away and you will need instructions.

Great access to the subway and easy walking distance to the Imperial Gardens, Marunouchi boulevards and Ginza.The hotel design and decor is traditional and fresh and the rooms are generous for Tokyo. The beds and linen are divine and while the rooms we stayed in were narrow they were long and had high ceilings. We stayed in interconnecting rooms. Housekeeping and concierge service were always excellent. It's a boutique hotel by Tokyo standards and we enjoyed the cosy ambience.I must mention the atrium breakfast room. It is located in the original dome of the station building and is light, airy and elegant. The breakfast buffet was excellent - especially the Japanese selection and the engaging chefs on the omelette station. As you leave each morning, the staff give you a delicious powder puff of a cake for a snack. We didn't dine at the restaurant or bar.The external plaza construction works did affect the sense of arrival to the hotel but we noticed no noise at night. The taxi drop off has been disrupted during construction, so taxis will drop off in front of the station entrance and not the hotel entrance. If arriving with a lot of luggage (as we did), I suggest that you fetch a porter from the hotel lobby or call in advance so that they are waiting to assist with your luggage. This location is quiet at night time, although very safe. If you are looking for dinner or supper, the closest options are the excellent station tunnel venues rather than street options.I am looking forward to returning to this hotel when the plaza work is complete.

The hotel is beautiful, the staff were wonderful (I emailed prior to arrival about my feather allergy- they responded quickly and provided hypoallergenic bedding for our stay), but there were some small niggles. The first one (this is not the hotels fault as such) is there is building work currently going on outside the station to make a new park, pavemented area. This will look amazing when completed but is a bit of an eye sore at the moment (plus they were still working at 9:15pm on one evening which was disturbing). Maybe check with the hotel to see if this work is still on going?The rooms are lovely with high ceilings, and very good black out curtains. The bathroom/ wet room is great! There is little draw storage space- two small bed side units with 2 draws (one draw had the safe in it, another had the touch and hotel night wear). Staying for 5 nights more space to unpack would have been great, the room had space for a chest of draws.There is hanging space for clothes but not many hangers (but I suspect the hotel would provide more if asked). You can occasionally feel some of the shinkansen arriving/ leaving the station but its not disruptive. One of the train stations entrances goes under some guest rooms- but this entrance is closed at night. The location (apart from the current building work) is excellent for the metro, JR lines, N'EX and shopping/restaurants.

Walking distance to Imperial Palace and Imperial East Garden. The location at the station makes it a great place to return from the day excursions. Also plenty of good food near and around the hotel.From the reservations we were not expecting much but once we walked into the hotel the warmth and friendliness of the staffs were apparent. Service was very good and staffs were genuinely helpful. We had a good chat with the concierge. The rooms was good with everything in good condition. The classic architecture of the hotel is also very very nice. No huge lobby but a warm cosy feel.Despite being unhappy about having to pay for my kids breakfast we were very happy with the quality of the breakfast. The food was of very high quality and taste is great. Free flow strawberries, melons and other seasonal fruits.I repeat, the breakfast is great.We do however wish that they have a king size bed room where we can add an extra bed. A good thing for families travelling with young kids is that they allow the kids to stay in the same room as long as you can share the beds. In our case we have two of them age four and six in tow.All in all it is a great place to stay if one is willing to pay for it.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","pwt2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong>",10,5.0

It is situated in quite a nice neighbourhood & since it's not located in a party or shopping district, a very nice place to come back to after a long day of exploring the city/country. It's also within walking distance to the Imperial Palace. There are still lots of restaurants & cafes around the hotel. You can find convenient stores in all of them. Anywhere from 5-15mins walk.The Japan Post Office is next to the hotel in the Kitte building where you can change foreign currency to Japanese yen at banking rates.The service staff at the hotel is beyond compare, they are efficient, extremely friendly & courteous. Always at hand to help with any travel question or making reservations at your selected restaurants. You usually will need a Japanese speaking person to make reservations. Some of the best restaurants in Tokyo is location in & around this hotel The hotel itself is modern & classy architecture design. Rooms are beautifully done & big for a Tokyo hotel. I stayed in their most basic room size & it's approx. 26 square meter. High ceiling gives you a more roomier feel to the room. My girlfriend swears they have the best beds she have ever slept in.

They often responded to emails within the hour. When reservations were not available at certain restaurants, they suggested wonderful alternatives and secured reservations for us. Once at the hotel, service continued to be impeccable. From the moment we checked in, staff members greeted us by name. When the lady who helped us with our luggage learned we were on our honeymoon, we returned to our room to find a beautiful swan display and fruit. Every staff member we interacted with was professional, helpful, and friendly. The staff helped us with our forwarded luggage, mail, holding our luggage, and with our cab to the airport. Room service was prompt and always came with a smile. We did not have to ask for help—the staff anticipated our needs and followed through with excellent service. As we do not speak Japanese, we greatly appreciated that the staff members all speak excellent English. Most impressively, the entire hotel staff was always in sync. When we called the front desk for help with our luggage the day that we were checking out, the lady who helped us knew that our flight was going to be late that evening, had reserved a taxi, and needed our luggage to be held by the hotel until it was time for us to head to the airport. When we returned to the hotel that evening to pick up our luggage, the staff member at the entrance of the hotel knew exactly who we were and went to get our luggage right away, without us asking.

Started a bit rocky as we did arrive very early off a flight from Australia. The concierge was wonderful - took our bags, greeted us with genuine warmth. We were ushered to reception to check in and while the receptionist was nice but she did tell me check-in was 3pm four times. As an hotelier I understand the situation but did find it annoying to be told over and over as I explained we would be going out for the day. We came back from being out and our room was ready around 1:30 pm and the greeting was again wonderful. From there on it was a brilliant stay. The staff are courteous, warming and so helpful. Clearly they deal with the as individuals and not numbers. The rooms are lovely – spacious and beautifully decorated and with everything you need for a great stay. The next day we had breakfast and again wonderful. We checked out for a day and returned to the hotel and we were greeted as old friends by a number of staff but particularly by a lady at concierge. I wish we got her name as her greeting back was such a nice experience after a long day of travel. They had also kindly upgraded our room. The only negative I can say is the one restaurant we tried Ristorante Enoteca Norio. We wanted to go to Blanc Rouge, the French Restaurant, but you needed a jacket something I do not travel with as I wear them for work. We settled on Ristorante Enoteca Norio and what a huge disappointment. There was a group of business people celebrating something and we were in a smaller area which was fine. Unfortunately it meant poor service which did not start the meal well. Would have been willing to overlook this as the staff and manager were obviously stressed but the food was exceptionally average and very limited.

Finding a central location in Tokyo was important and by all accounts the Tokyo Station Hotel fit the bill. Upon arriving at the train station on the Narita Express from the airport one has to navigate 5 floors and literally thousands of people in a maze of corridors to find the way to the hotel entrance. Luckily our daughter-in-law is Japanese and was the perfect guide. The hotel itself is operated by Japan Railways (JR) and will be somewhat familiar to those who have stayed in similar properties once owned and operated by the Canadian National Railway in locations such as the Chateau Frontenac in Quebec or the Chateau Lake Louise. All of these properties including the Tokyo Station Hotel harken back to a day when train travel was romantic, exciting and sometimes even thrilling. While the actual train station associated with the Tokyo Station Hotel has undergone vast expansion to accommodate thousands of daily commuters once you step into the Hotel you are transported into another world of quiet confidence and luxury. Our rooms on both ends of our trip to Kyoto were spacious and well appointed. Service was impeccable especially that of Yoshiki Kamata, the Duty Manager at the Hotel. Front Reception Supervisor Tatsunori Watabe was a true professional and worked out last minute arrangements for us. My suggestions for the hotel are as follows: provide your guests with seating areas to sit and relax. The two hotel restaurants were restricted to those eating and drinking. A $15 cup of coffee was, I was told, intended to prevent guests from lingering. That is nonsense in a hotel charging on average $500 per night. The workout room was closed the weekend I was there and opens later in the morning usually. A international hotel of this stature should provide hours of operation more in tune with travelers needs.

As it's owned by Japan Rail, the concierge also bought my complicated regional train tickets for me before we arrived, which took the stress out of our short turnaround. The location inside the Station is incredibly convenient, and we snuck in some tasty bento from Daimaru for a lazy and cheap lunch while we recovered from our flight. The international buffet breakfast in the cathedral ceilinged Atrium was one of the best I've had, and the restoration of this beautiful old building is wonderful to see.

Check-in was very fast and all of the staff were very professional and courteous during my stay. The concierge came with me to fix me up with a Suica card and when it was time to travel home a staff member escorted me to the Narita Express platform. First class service!My room was slightly cramped, which also meant that there was not much shelf space but I think this is probably the norm for Tokyo hotels. On the other hand it had a very high ceiling and very high windows which made it feel bigger than it was. In addition, it probably had the best combined bath and walk-in shower room of any hotel that I have stayed in. The room was immaculately cleaned each day and all consumable products (toiletries, tissues etc.) were topped up or replaced straight away. There were also some very high tech features - a large 4K TV screen; an automatically opening/closing/flushing toilet; and a lighting setup that could be fully controlled from the bedside.A huge bonus is the hotel's location, inside Tokyo's main railway station, with the metro just outside. It was so nice after a long day's travelling to get off the shinkansen and be in my room within two or three minutes. Finally, the hotel had a nice ""feel"" to it. That is something you can't put into words but it does count for a lot. After two weeks it felt a bit like home and I was sorry to leave.

Each room has double glazed windows so very little outside noise gets in. All the staff a extremely polite. Every single staff member you come across greets you. I would have given the hotel 5 stars if the breakfast had not been so expensive. I only felt like a bowl of fruit and maybe a pastry, but there was no a la carte menu, so at around $50 Australian my bowl of fruit was outrageous. The other reason for my score was our room very small and directly overlooking a building site. I know that is out of the hotels hands, but the site was not a pleasant view. The room would have been more suitable for one person. (It was a queen palace view.) This was the last leg of our journey and all our rooms had been quite a bit larger.

We had been travelling round Japan, staying in perfectly adequate, reasonably-priced business hotel but knew we would be in need of a good night's sleep after a long journey, and before a long-haul flight the next day. So we chose this hotel as it was obviously easy to get to from the station (as in, right on top of it!) and booked the least expensive room we could find. We ended up with a small, unusually-shaped, but extremely comfortable, room overlooking the station concourse. Sound proofing was excellent, so we were not troubled by station announcements, mattress was superb, so we had a great night's sleep.The highlight was the large bathroom. It was worth the stay just for that! Massive bath, separate large shower room, separate WC and central area with sink, mirror et al.Breakfast was expensive but wonderful. Top notch service, huge variety of Western, Oriental and Middle Eastern foods on offer - plus anything you wanted to order...The central location of the hotel means all the sights are within very easy reach. It's also an extremely handsome building, which we didn't think we'd care about, but having stayed in extremely functional/brutalist-looking hotels everywhere else, it did actually add to our enjoyment.So - this is a luxury hotel, and you have to pay for it.

The rooms are decorated classic Victorian with 13 foot ceilings, but everything in the guest rooms and private bathrooms is modern. The hotel has a very nice large lounge on the first floor which appeared to be well used, though we never made it in. Service was excellent. We obtained a room upgrade at check-in as I feared the classic room we had reserved would be a big city ""postage stamp"" room. The upgrade to a Junior Twin Suite was great and spacious to include large bath room and alcove sitting area. Bed turn-downs with treats was appreciated. One bellhop provided me a tour of the building on request and another guided us through the train station and helped with luggage during our departure. It appeared most of the staff spoke English.Our only critique of the Tokyo Station Hotel is that it did not seem like the station and the hotel were as well coordinated as they could be. When we arrived in Tokyo Station, we never saw a sign directing us to the hotel (Gate 1 of the Marunouchi Line) and it appeared to go in and out of the station to visit shops you needed a subway or train ticket (or a rail pass which we had). The hotel does give rail pass holders a discount, but I'm guessing most of their guests don't use rail passes. We will definitely consider staying here again.

The fact that this hotel is attached to Tokyo Station is very handy; we took a train directly from Narita to Tokyo station during a rain storm and never had to step outside. That said, Tokyo station is huge and it took us a while to navigate our way to the hotel. I strongly suggest studying the hotel direction before you embark on this journey. Tokyo Station is not only a large and confusing train station, it's also a huge mall and very crowded. I suggest avoiding/departing during rush hour, also if you plan to depart the station by high speed rail (Shinkasen), buy your tickets early and give yourself extra time to find your platform. The Station hotel is located right next to the Imperial Palace, it was closed on the day we were there but we there but had it been open we would have loved to walk through the gardens before catching our train to Kanazawa.

It was actually the smallest hotel room we stayed in during our trip. The room is not big enough for a rollaway bed nor is there a sofa couch. They put side guard rails on the bed because we had to share the king size bed with our 9 year old daughter. For 1 night this was fine, but there's no way I would have done more days with1 bed.

The rooms are very nice and clean, are relatively new and have good bathrooms. One complaint is the rooms can be a bit small. On my most recent visit I was given a room that must have been one of the smallest. It looked into the south entrance to Tokyo Station (so not outside) and was in the corner so everything was squeezed in. Perhaps my travel agent booked me a cheaper class of room as on my prior visit the room was more spacious. The concierge is also very good at Tokyo Station. Marie Antoinette has helped me during both my visits and was very knowledgeable and helpful in booking restaurants. Most of my meetings tend to be walking distance from the hotel which is a plus. If I was traveling for leisure I may consider staying in a different area as a bit more lively at night in places like Shibuya, but for business the location is perfect.

There is a Japanese buffet line that offers exclusively Japanese delicacies, but for us, we enjoyed the European selection.

Small room with a fireplace, overlooking the Seine, daintily decorated and somewhat kitsch in a fin-de-siècle kind of way. The museum was a major train station in the late 19th, early 20th century. In those days hotels were a still a fairly new concept while train travel was rapidly expanding. People suddenly could go places but once arrived, there were few places to rest their heads. Train stations filled this need by incorporating hotels into their buildings. Tokyo station was built in 1915 during the Meiji era when Japan was frantically and almost blindly copying Western ways. And indeed, the architecture is thoroughly Western even though the architect, Tatsuno Kingo was Japanese. He studied under Josiah Conder and clearly did his best to produce the most Western design possible. Thus Western ideas not only manifested themselves in the physical look of the building but also in its mode of operation: The station includes a hotel in its midst. The entrance is on the ground floor, close to the dome on the right as seen from the Marunouchi side. The rooms are on the second floor, lining up from one dome to the other. Some rooms looks out towards the Imperial Palace. Mine looks inside into the space under the right dome. This makes for a somewhat surreal feeling as there I was in my comfortable room, watching the masses of travelers and tourists rushing to and fro below.This is a luxurious place. The recent renovation has endowed it with all manners of fancy, expensive items. The shower and bathtub are roomy and pleasant to use. I am not much into soaking but my Japanese girlfriend who must have her soaking every night thoroughly enjoyed the tub. We did not have time to sample the food at the various restaurants and cafés but they all look quite deluxe and delicious. While the hotel definitely inspires luxury, it misses one component that luxury must always have, which is spaciousness. In a place like Tokyo where space is at a premium, roominess is all the more crucial in projecting luxury. Sadly, this hotel is short on space, inside and outside the room. The lobby while very pleasant feels cramped and crowded. My room feels overstuffed. In spite of its smallness it is filled with all sorts of knick-knacks for that’s what luxury demands. The sink area overflows with amenities, so much so that I had a hard time finding space for my own few items. The same is true with the little desk where the TV is. Finally, since a king bed is de rigueur in this sort of establishment, there is little room left. In fact, one side of the bed is almost against a wall so there is no way to climb on the bed from that side. All that said, this is a hotel inside a train station. If one wants to keep the original design, that’s how tight things will be.In the end, what I appreciate most about this hotel is its location. I only stayed there one night on my way back to Tokyo from Hiroshima before flying out the next day. The Tokaido Shinkansen terminus is at Tokyo Station, my Narita Express train also departed from there. The Marunouchi and Yaesu areas around the hotel are pleasant. I only had to drag my suitcase up a few elevators when I got off the Shinkansen and down a few elevators to board the Narita Express the next day. I will stay here again when I need to be in Tokyo one night before flying out.","san diego, CA","sd122</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>san diego, CA</strong>",86,4.0

There are enough cafes and convenience stores in the station to keep your gastronomic tummy bulging and satisfied.

After countless days of research, my partner and I chose The Tokyo Station Hotel as our base in the city for our anniversary trip to Japan, and we have nothing but compliments for the property and staff. As tourists, Tokyo Station Hotel absolutely cannot be surpassed in terms of location. I cannot emphasize enough how reassuring it was to know we could always very easily get back to our hotel simply by the fact that a number of rail networks converged at the train station below. The fact that many intercity rail lines, the NEX train from Narita, and all shinkansen lines out of Tokyo all converge here make this the perfect place to begin exploring not only the city but the rest of Japan. Amazingly, despite all the transit associated with the property, the hotel was always very peaceful and gave no indication of being just floors above Tokyo's major train station.Having gone through a recent renovation, the hotel property and guest accommodations are beautifully modern, impeccably clean, and spacious. The beds are very comfortable with room controls for lighting and automated window shades right at the bedside. The bathroom is cavernous, and the deep soaking tub and huge rainfall shower head were a total point of relaxation after long hours in the city. Every space encountered was clean and spotless.Above all, I cannot compliment the staff enough for all of the assistance they provided both before our arrival and during our stay. The chief concierge, Ms. Mori, was incredibly patient and helpful in arranging a number of points in our itinerary before we even arrived by booking impossible restaurant reservations and securing great concert tickets, and her colleague, Mr. Otsuka, was an indispensable resource of information and help for us during our stay. The amount of patience and willingness to help from the concierge and the entire hotel staff elevate this property to true luxe levels. From the moment we stepped off the train from Narita and escorted to check-in with white glove service to our check-out where we were again escorted to our train platform with the same amazing bell staff, everyone that works at Tokyo Station Hotel treated us to absolutely royal service - always present, always polite, always anticipating.

My 5 year old daughter and I had been traveling for a while in Japan, and literally came out of the train station and found this hotel using TripAdvisor's ""near me now"" feature.When we entered the hotel I was immediately impressed, but my tired, cranky and embarrassed to say slightly spoiled daughter only wanted to know if the hotel had a pool. When we found out it didn't she nearly had a meltdown on the marble floor of their very finely furnished lobby. Mortified, I asked the concierge if we could sit down while I figured out another hotel to book. The hotel staff and concierge were totally gratuitous, and even helped me by answering questions about other hotels I found in the area on my TripAdvisor app on my phone. Finally my daughter calmed down after we ate dinner at a nearby Italian restaurant that the concierge recommended and I was able to talk her ""highness"" into staying at this amazing hotel despite the fact it lacked the pool for her to splash around it.We were offered an upgraded room with a view of the train station. It was gorgeously decorated. And my daughter decided she liked the hotel after all since she felt like a princess in the lavish room.Whew.Anyway, the hotel was 5 star from top to bottom, and the location was excellent. Of course we were able to hop on trains and taxis just outside of the hotel doors. We loved the remodel that they did on the classic historical rooms. They were very high end from all the fixtures, to the furnishings, to the linens, and on and on. The room was stocked with plenty of extras. They even had some special gifts for my slightly spoiled daughter waiting for us when we went up to our room. And tiny slippers in just her size, plus special soaps, shampoos, etc. etc. etc. just for her, in addition to all the other lovely amenities. The staff was top flight all around, even charging my nearly empty battery on my phone in the security luggage room for me while my daughter and I went out to dinner at an Italian restaurant, prior to even deciding to stay at this hotel! The service was over the top before we even spent a dime... that says a lot, especially since we looked really disheveled after traveling all day, and my daughter basically caused a small scene in their very fancy lobby full of well dressed guests.

We could not recommend this hotel more highly. The location and convenience factor absolutely cannot be beat. You travel around the city almost exclusively by train (and this is coming from nyc people who take cabs everywhere there - but here the taxi drivers do not speak much English and even with screenshots of addresses in Japanese we would usually be left off somewhere wrong). Having one of the most central train stations right there just made navigating a cinch! Also, the NEX (narita express train) connects you directly from the airport to the hotel in 1 hour. (Another side note: last NEX train is ~9:45pm so of you have a late arriving flight like ours, you cannot use the NEX. The Limousine Bus, though, has departures until 11pm and also goes directly from airport to Tokyo Station).The hotel service was also fantastic both before we arrived in Japan and while we were there. All emails were answered promptly and they helped us secure a reservation at a hard to get sushi restaurant. While we were there, everyone was so helpful and friendly. They helped us forward a large piece of luggage to our next destination via Ta-Q-Bin when we realized how tough it would be to lug it on the trains.We stayed in a ""classic room"". It was small but very nice and modern. Bed was large and comfortable. Bathroom had all amenities and was pristine. The only thing missing which didn't really bother us was that there weren't really any drawers to put clothes into (there was a closet with a shelf on top though). We didn't get the breakfast package but purchased breakfast there one of the mornings in the Atrium which was lovely with Japanese and Western options in a large buffet.All in all, we had a fantastic stay at the Tokyo Station hotel and would definitely stay here again.

Firstly my wife, who was to celebrate a significant birthday, adored another restored railway hotel (St Pancras in London). Secondly I read on this site that the head concierge Ms Mori spoke fluent English which I though would be most helpful as we speak next to no Japanese. Thirdly we were to travel to Kyoto by Shinkansen and I felt this hotel might be very convenient for that purpose.Well, my wife did love the hotel which has been restored beautifully. We have three boys aged ten to fourteen and the rooms are plenty big enough even with an extra bed. If you like old and low rise you really should stay here.They are building an underground car park in the forecourt, but there is no noise and our rooms had a view over it towards the Imperial Palace. The bathrooms are lovely and heated Japanese toilet seats should go global.It is minutes to the train platform and a staff member showed us there with grace and charm. You can stop for a bento box en route.So the whole experience is glorious and you will probably enjoy Tokyo hugely as a result (we did), But I haven't written about the front desk staff. To say that Ms Mori and her concierge team are friendly and capable is like saying Lionel Messi and Barcelona can play football a bit. I have never, and i mean never, been treated as well as this. Want to celebrate your wife's birthday in style but aware this is a smart hotel and five Australian and Japanese kids in the hotel lobby might be frowned upon? Ms Mori will consult the general manager who will allow the use of a small private dining room off the airy atrium where breakfast is served. And without being asked, the waiter will take a picture of you all and present it to you five minutes later in a photo-folder embossed with the hotel crest. And when you return to your room there will be a beautiful flower arrangement for your wife and a bath towel folded into the shape of an elephant we christened Bertha.The lovely staff at the Tokyo Station Hotel made it very easy for us to enjoy their city, and they took, I think, genuine pleasure in doing so. I must ask Ms Mori to send one of her team down to Australia, because I'm quite sure they would organise my business and personal life a heck of a lot better than I do!","Perth, Australia","adbuchanan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",32,5.0

First off the Meet and Greet Service at the Shinkansen platform was most helpful, and although I failed to get the name of the young woman who assisted us, she left a wonderful first impression of the service we experienced throughout our stay. Every person on the staff who we had contact with was efficient, friendly and went out of their way to help us have a great trip. Were it not for Marie Antoinette Mori and Tomonori Otsuka, we might still be out wandering the streets of Tokyo looking for our sometimes obscure destinations! My special thanks to Tomonori for being so helpful, patient and kind to us during our stay. I looked forward to our encounters with him - between he and Ms Mori, definitely one of the best concierge encounters I have experienced in my travels. The room (along with the entire Hotel) was impeccably spotless and gorgeously maintained. The bathroom was the best of the five hotels in our Japan trip. It had a lovely huge soaking tub and a fantastic rain shower that was perfect for relaxing after a long day walking around. We also greatly enjoyed the convenient location of the Hotel for ending our trip and going to Narita Airport (again, where the very helpful young woman and a young gentleman helped us get back to the platform with our luggage). All in all, one of the very best hotel experiences we've had - other hotels should take a course in The Tokyo Station Hotel way of professionalism with their kind, patient and helpful attitude of everyone on the staff (other hotels , although very efficient, were a bit stuffy and abrupt).

There are many factors that cause me to want to give it a full mark. 1. Location : Being right at Tokyo station was very convenient because you have both Metro and JR train to choose plus when you email the concierge at least 24 hours prior to your arrival, they will send you instructions of how to arrange the Meet and Greet service at the Narita Express platform. 2. Service : Let me start from the legendary Ms. Marie Antoinette Mori, I read from Tripadvisors before I chose this hotel that this Chief Concierge Lady would do all she can to make it happen for the clients. And she did it for me as well. She managed to book me two Michelin Star restaurants that one of them was quite hard to book. I only realize how hard it was to book the restaurant only when my friend told me that she tried to book this restaurant two months in advance without success, but I only wrote about three weeks before I arrived and Ms. Mori made it happen for me.  Other staffs were mostly equally enthusiastic and I need to specially thank Mr. Yoshiki Kamata the Duty Manager on May 17th 2015 that kindly took me to the room personally to make me able to refresh as soon as possible to continue on to my dinner appointment. 3. Comfort and Quiet : My bedroom window was facing the interior of the hotel I could even see people on escalator in the train station through the grill butI could not hear any noise coming in. 4. Breakfast : The food, fruits, coffee, service... everything was just perfect. 5. Perfection : Did I mention everything was perfect. Just let it be known and I'm certain the staffs at The Tokyo Station will try to make it happen for you in a very classy manner. P.S. I forgot my iPhone chargers at the room and I emailed the hotel from the airport. The next day they were already posting my chargers to be waiting for me at the hotel in Fukuoka that I'll be staying at.

We were only staying one night, coming in from Kyoto by train and leaving for Narita airport next day.We were quite disappointed this time our room did not have much of a view, even though we booked a palace view room.The room we were in was also very loud, firstly we could hear trains rattling below us & second there was construction work directly outside our room which ran until midnight on a Saturday evening.When we rang the front desk to ask if we could move to a quieter part of the hotel, we were told only if we were willing to pay for a full upgrade. Given it was 10pm and we were checking out the next morning & we were given no warning about the major digging happening directly outside our window - this is really poor service. If they had a better room on a quiet side of the hotel vacant anyway, they would have lost nothing letting us move there for one night given the problem we had.We stayed at the Capitol Hotel when we first arrived in Tokyo & they had a notice in the rooms warning of any construction work during May and which parts of the hotel it may effect - we had zero warning at TSH. Also quiet envious of all the reports of help finding the narita express platform and help with luggage...after not much sleep we got no such offer at checkout / though we did ask for directions, what we got was not particularly helpful.

All our trains arrived and departed from this station making it very convenient. No need for taxis - wheeling luggage from and to platforms was fine. Plenty of small eateries and convenience stores in the actual station itself. Staff service was excellent - the best we have anywhere. We arrived in the morning from a cruise, dropped our luggage off and went out to Disneyland. On our return, we were escorted to our room. Very well appointed - won't spoil the surprises with details! Our luggage was already there and we were shown where things were. Next day they tried to help us print boarding passes but our airline's website kept crashing.

The service is impeccable and the design is exquisite. Complimentary meet and greet service at Tokyo Station was extremely helpful since Tokyo Station is fairly large and most of the railway staff don't speak english. The purpose of my visit to Tokyo was actually to try out Sukiyabashi Jiro. Since the restaurant only had ten seats, it was extremely difficult to secure a reservation. Despite all the challenges, Mori, Chief Concierge at the Tokyo Station Hotel made the impossible possible. She was really helpful and courteous and offered many other michelin restaurant suggestions for my upcoming visits to Tokyo. I would recommend anyone who wishes to stay at the hotel to contact her if you want reservations at popular restaurants. All of the staff stopped and bowed whenever I walked through the hotel lobby and hallways; it was more like staying in a palace than in a hotel! The only problem I had at this hotel was that I was originally booked into a Dome side room. When i made the reservation the staff told me that the rooms are overlooking the station but there won't be any noise in the room. Upon arriving to the room i could hear railway announcements coming from the station every 5 minutes or so. I requested a room change however the hotel was at high capacity. I was offered 2 options, to downgrade to a lower category room at not charge, or to pay 3000 yen in addition to switch to a slightly larger room of the same room category. I already paid a fairly amount of money for the Dome room so of course of chose to upgrade the room. When i checked out, the front desk agent apologized about the extra charge and told me again that they charged me because the hotel was full. I was confused about why they charged me extra when it wasn't my fault that the hotel was full and that my original room was noisy. Standard procedure should've been an upgrade without charge.

Although the location is excellent, it took me quite a few minutes to make my way to the hotel.

It was only after navigating the underground pathways that I managed to make my way there. Thankfully the concierge later pointed out a short cut if I'm on the ground floor. There's a direct pathway from the Yaesu North side of Tokyo Station to the Marunouchi North side, and from there it's just another minute's walk.The hotel itself is a wonderful combination of colonial and modern design elements. It certainly feels more like a boutique than mega hotel, very much in line with it's membership in the SLH group of hotels. They were out of single rooms the night I stayed, as such I made do with a twin room. The size is just nice for two people, very cosy. The beds are quite comfortable and they somehow managed to include a little seating area despite the room's size. The bathroom area is just right and even includes a bathtub. Water pressure was good. The staff are very helpful, always greeting guests with a smile and providing as much information as possible. With it's unparalleled location at Tokyo Station, you can get to almost any of the train platforms within 5 minutes or so. Access to shopping and food is also a few minutes walk away, with Daimaru at the Yaesu side of Tokyo Station.

Walk out the door of the hotel and go either right and left and walk down the side of the railway and just find restaurant after restaurant all with delicious food and sake....and just so much fun.....and food was so tasty.There are great supermarkets in the bottom floors of Marunouchi buildings and the alcohol is cheaper in these shops than at duty free....which amazed us so muchWould I stay at the Tokyo Station Hotel again...yes within a heart beat....it was a serene, lovely haven, so comfortable and the rooms were spotless, superb and completely comfortable....and the staff always there to resolve queries.

And while many booking websites offer the ""Tokyo Station Hotel"", it's never ever available. Add to this the special location, and the ""Tokyo Station Hotel"" becomes a bit of a myth. When entering the station via the North or South gate one can gaze up to the rooms, but little have gazed down from those rooms.So when the ""Tokyo Station Hotel"" was available using my favourite booking site, I took my chance! From the moment I checked in to the moment I left, it lived up to its reputation. It starts with the location, which of course is very convenient. Tokyo Station is in the centre of town and of course every other place can easily be reached from the station.My room (#3031) was a mid sized room, overlooking the square in front of the station. The style is classic, but certainly not old or outdated. Everything looks so clean that one thinks he/she is the first person ever to stay in that room. The bathroom is positively huge, with a big bath, hand shower and rain shower. The safe is big enough to hold a laptop and a DSLR camera. The beds are big and comfortable, with good pillows.If I have something to complain, it has to be in the minor details. The shoe shine service is just a courtisy of the staff, while some other high class hotels hire professional shoe-shiners to do the job (the difference in the result is obvious). Also, the bar closes quiet early (22.00) and that seems a bit odd for a bar.Other than that, this hotel leaves little to be desired. Thanks to excellent sound insulation, one can sleep in late while tens of thousands of workers move in and out of the station underneath travelling from and to work. And this is the magic of the ""Tokyo Station Hotel"": it gives the very priviliged feeling of being in an exclusive bubble, an oasis of peace and quiet amidst the hussle and bussle of Tokyo Station.","Tokyo, Japan","i0kan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",291,5.0

We had high hopes for the hotel given the reviews and the pictures, but were disappointed during our stay. Having stayed at The Capitol on our arrival in Tokyo we felt there was a big dip in service and quality. The room was smaller than we expected and laid out in a very strange manner, over stuffed with furniture leaving little room to move around. All the restaurants were already fully booked until late and the room service menu was pitiful. I expected it to be on a par with a Ritz Carlton or a Relais Chateaux hotel but it wasn’t the same by any means. The two best things about the hotel are the original architecture and the location. It was at least perfect for when we had to leave at 6am to get the express train to Narita. Very disappointing for our last two nights after an amazing two week stay in Japan.

Just three stories high, it's hardly the typical hotel. Tokyo Station Hotel is steeped in one-hundred years of history. Otherwise, who would build a three-story structure in one of the most exclusive prime properties in Japan in the year 2012? One of the third-floor junior suites affords a perfect view of the central street sandwiched between two high-rises, with just a glimpse of the imperial palace grounds in the distance. It's a view that has changed, but hasn't changed for a century. Someone looked out a window from the old hotel in the same direction, surrounded by the luxury of those days, one hundred years ago. Perhaps they dined on a terrace. That's what makes the Tokyo Station Hotel exclusive. The hotel has witnessed two world wars and rapid economic growth, followed by a bubble economy, then a long recession. Millions have stayed there, dined there, passed through or by there. The old red brick building has greeted visitors from throughout Japan and the world for one-hundred years now - yes, some of the old centennial bricks have been plastered in cosmetically in parts of the same building. People have honeymooned there, said their farewells there - at Tokyo's central hub station - and passed by there on their way to work every day there for a century. The joys and sorrows and hopes and dreams of millions have passed through or by Tokyo Station Hotel.

We stayed in the hotel on two separate occasions. I selected the hotel for its location and historical aspects. In a city/country where service is spelled with a capital S, The Tokyo Station should be spelled with all CAPITALS. To find the hotel itself is a bit of a challenge, the first time around. For our first departure, the hotel staff escorted our party to our platform and made sure that we got on the right train and car. We have stayed in a few hotels around the globe. The key difference no matter what the architectural details are like is the people. This is where Tokyo Station shines. I would like to also compliment the team who designed and installed the hallway lamps. I can't remember ever seeing such a precision job. They were all perfectly aligned and working.Upon check-in for the first visit, there was a mix-up on my charge card and the hotel staff worked with me and kept an awkward situation from becoming an embarrassing situation. If this was the only issue, I would still have been pleased but when checking out, the another problem occurred. Again, the cashier worked with us to resolve issue as the bell staff waited to ensure that we had all of our luggage. Once the payment issue was resolved, the quickly got us to the train platform.These incidents described only address the more major assistance that we received. There were many others that started once walked through the entrance.The Tokyo Station is celebrating their 100th year anniversary.

Also, don't miss the Aoyama Flower Garden Tea Room--which is on Omotesando (cross street is Aoyama Dori)--walk THROUGH the Garden shop for the tea room----you will be surprised. the specialty here is the French toast that everyone raves about. sorry i had to divert from the hotel info, but i just had to tell people about the show and the tea room!!!! most people don't seem to know about it. even the people who live there!!!",hawaii,"toonza</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>hawaii</strong>",19,3.0

The opportunity came in my trip to Japan this year.Right in the heart of the Tokyo Station, this was home for the five days stay in Japan. I flew in from a direct flight from Manila to Haneda, which was perfect because it was a 26 minutes transfer from Haneda to the Tokyo Station (via the monorail and a train transfer Tokyo Station).Upon arrival at the Tokyo Station, take the South Marunouchi exit and that's about it...you're practically a few steps from the hotel. For a hotel in Japan, this had all the punches and oomph in glitz, glamor and grandeur. The lobby was beautifully appointed. The access to the rooms was easy from either the main entrance or from the entrance in the central and north areas. The hallway is quiet (considering that we're just above the hotel) and the rooms have double windows and there's not a peep of noise from the outside.We were booked in a King room on the Palace Side. Upon entering the room, I was awed at the elegance of this hotel. High ceilings. A plush bathroom that had a bathtub and a rain shower in the same area. Amenities in abundance fit for royalty. A warm comfortable bed with very comfortable pillows. Drip coffee. Pajamas. Free wifi. Humidifier. A full mini-bar. There's everything in the room that would make you feel pampered.Then there's the breakfast at the Atrium. While it is one great spread, it's one expensive spread as well. Priced at almost 4000Yen per person, you can only eat so much. Food at Dean & Deluca in front of the hotel would cost you 1/4 the cost of the breakfast buffet. And the restaurants are open to the public. Which meant that whether you're a guest in the hotel or a walk-in, you'd need reservations or queue.On arrival, our rooms weren't ready yet (although it was already 3PM) and we had to wait for our rooms. Considering that there was nothing to do but eat, we romped around the hotel looking for a place for lunch, but even the lobby coffee shop was full to the hilt.Overall though, except for the glitch on check-in, I would highly recommend this hotel as it is the center point for travel to and from any point in Tokyo. It is also walking distance to Daimaru and the Imperial Palace and other Marunouchi shops in the area. Incidentally, if you go this time of the year, there's a 1.2Km stretch of lights and Disney along the Marunouchi district.

Not so with an arrival in Tokyo with a booking at the Tokyo Station Hotel (TSH). You see, the Narita (Airport) Express stops just a minute's (undercover) walk away, and if you have made prior arrangements, there will even be a uniformed member of the concierge staff to meet you at the door of your train's carriage.The staff of this hotel are superb - extremely professional in manner, presentation, courtesy, knowledge, and right on top of their game. Pre-arrival questions of reservation and concierge staff (take a bow, Ms Mori) are responded to promptly and informatively.Although originally built in 1912 (and bombed in 1945) the TSH has undergone a major luxury refit/rebuild which was completed in 2012. The result is a high quality boutique hotel that oozes charm and comfort. Rooms are not large (at least the bedroom in the case of room 3084 - but the marble bathroom with full bath, rainfall shower, and hi-tech toilet) was spacious. Though it should be said that when we returned for a second visit Room 3085, of a slightly different design was larger. On the room plan we noticed that 3075 and 3088 might well be investigated also.Linen, toiletries, room décor are of high quality, and the hotel passed our 'elevator test' (always a good indication of attention to cleanliness and detail) with flying colours. Speaking of elevators, security is impressive with key-activated glass sliding doors keeping non-guests out of corridor areas on each floor.Not surprisingly, the '' Dome "" room we booked had an internal view of one of the impressive domes of the railway station with commuters able to seen rushing to and fro. No noise at all came from the working station.Breakfast in the impressive Atrium restaurant was excellent and catered to all tastes.But above all, this hotel has a fantastic location in central Tokyo - lots of restaurants nearby, the Tokyo station is the terminus for the Shinkhansen, (and has access to all other subway and other rail lines), and the Hato bus interchange is a few metres away also (incidentally, if you are planning to visit Mt Fuji, check out the Hato (big Japanese company) prices and compare them to the other excursion companies - they kill them). While the TSH is at the South Marunouchi entrance to the station, you can exchange your JR Rail vouchers for passes at the North entrance, about 400 m away... easy.With prices for the Dome Room with breakfast at around JPY 34,000, we thought this to be reasonable for a quality hotel, the location of which cannot be beaten.","Ballarat, Australia","gaad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ballarat, Australia</strong>",413,5.0

While this comes with a price their service and rooms exceeded our expectations. Firstly, we commend the staff, every question we had (before and during our stay) were answered promptly and thoroughly. The staff exhibits attention to details and were very willing to go out of their way to assist you. 5 stars just for that. Secondly, the rooms were spacious by Japanese standard. We stayed for 5 nights on the 3rd floor in a twin share. The beds were comfortable and the room was well equipped. The cleaning and replenishing of the rooms were thorough each day. We also stayed 5 nights on the 2nd level in a King suite. Beautiful while it's slightly smaller than the previous room. They also have extremely high ceilings so you feel comfortable and relaxed. The room's cleanliness is also 5 stars. Thirdly, they offer free wifi in the rooms as well as around the hotel. This may seem trivial but in Japan this is not a standard feature of hotels. This is also highly desirable as Japan does not offer free wifi in many places. The free wifi at this hotel is functional and reasonable speed (we've been to many hotels where the free wifi was so slow it's obviously not designed to give you freebies).Fourthly, the location of this hotel is without doubt central and convenient. It is located at the JR Tokyo Station which has many lines and subways leading to various different locations. We found this the most desirable as we were intending to travel a lot during our stay. It is also 5 mins walk to the Imperial Palace. If you enjoy a morning walk, there's the place to go. The hotel within walking distance to a number of eateries, department stores, bookstores, coffee shops. So you literally could spend every night choosing different restaurants to dine at and shop until your legs bring you home. Love this place. If you need a comfortable central hotel, this is the one to book with. Do try and book early because this hotel is so popular it gets booked out months in advance.

Our flight arrived mid evening and the next morning we were heading down to Kyoto quite early. As it was our first time in Japan we didn’t want to have to navigate too much on our first night, being tired and with luggage. Tokyo Station hotel is conveniently located above Tokyo Station at street level and we’d marked the exit (Marunouchi South Gate) on a station map before we left home to make the transition up as simple as possible. From down in the station it was easy enough to follow the signs to get to where we needed to go. I was surprised at how large Tokyo Station was and equally at how busy it was at 10pm at night. Checking in was easy and the hotel was explained to us along with a map of where all of the amenities were located. We had pre ordered a wifi device through Global Advanced Communications and it was waiting for us at check-in as well. We were escorted to our room down a series of very long corridors - so much so that a number of coloured lights were pointed out to us as where we should aim for when returning downstairs from our room. All common areas of the hotel were immaculate and all staff that we encountered politely stopped to greet us.We booked a Palace Side Queen room. Size wise it was on par with other rooms we booked for our trip in Japan. Easy enough to move around with a couple of bags. The high ceilings certainly give the room an added spaciousness. The furnishings in the room were incredible with large windows and thick curtains. The bathroom was also huge with a separate rain shower and bath - perfect after a long flight. All other room amenities are as expected - slippers, robes, free wifi, tea/coffee, complimentary water and toiletries. The bed was firm which I later learned was fairly standard in Japan. We didn't hear any noise from the station below. The hotel is located in between Chiyoda and Ginza. We ended up walking around the area that night - nice wide streets and very clean. We took the opportunity to buy a Suica card, JR Pass and reserve our seat on the Shinkansen in the morning. The next morning before checking out we got up early, had breakfast nearby and took a walk over to the Imperial Palace (20 mins each way). Special mention to S Fukunaga who escorted us and our luggage, from the hotel lobby, through the madness of Tokyo station to our car on the Shinkansen platform. Exemplary service. Thank you. I cannot fault the Tokyo Station Hotel.

How good is that? You get off Shinkansen, a few mins later, you are in your room. The room itself is very quiet, I anticipated some noise from the train station but I almost forgot where I was as my room was so quiet.Service: Check in staff was so friendly, they truly understand what good service is supposed to be. What I noticed in Japan while I was there for about a week, most people won't look at my eyes when they talk. Most people talks very politely but I could tell they are just following the procedure. The front desk clerks looked at my eyes and smiled as they welcomed me to the hotel. After the check in process, a nice lady offered to take my bag (which I refused as she as such a tiny lady and I thought I had more muscle to carry heavy stuff), and showed me to my room. As we walked, she explained to me about the hotel history and safety of the hotel. The way she explained to me shows she cares about hotel guests, and was proud to work for the hotel.Room: Standard size, not too large and less counter space but it was enough to get what I needed to get done. They had three outlet plugs on the work desk, I was able to charge my electronics, and with a very stable free wifi, I was able to get a lot of work done. The bed they had in my room was very nice too. Mattress they had was what I felt comfortable. Not too hard, soft enough, I was able to sleep very well. I like the bathroom too. Although the counter space was on a smaller side but still had just enough space to put everything I needed in the bathroom. I enjoyed a nice bath and loved the fluffy bathrobe. Just what I needed after two weeks of business trip in Asia. At the check out, since I was traveling by Narita Express, they offered to carry my suitcase to the train platform. ( I declined but it was such a nice gesture that they offered)Unfortunately I didn't have time to enjoy any of their restaurant facility, I definitely would love to come back to try them. When I started traveling to Tokyo for business frequently, the Tokyo Station was always under construction. When I came to Japan last year, I finally saw the construction finished and remodel for the hotel was completed. I told myself, the next chance I get, I am going to stay at this hotel. I am glad I was able to stay at this hotel finally.If you are looking for a nice comfortable stay with excellent service, this is the hotel for you.

The hotel was very very clean at all times, always looked and smelled great. Despite the size of the bedroom, it had everything you would need and more. Loved that they would give you a fresh set of pajamas every day. Shower with tub on the side was great. Furnishings were very pretty. This would have been the perfect hotel if the rooms were bigger.Location wise, thought it was perfect for getting around to Anywhere. Hotel has an entrance to the JR station (sorry I forgot if it was the North or South side), and just outside that would lead to the other trains (there is an elevator if you have huge luggage). Very convenient to go to and from the airport especially since they also had a free Meet and Greet service, and Send off service (when we checked out, I asked Guest Relations what would be the best way to get to Narita Express, and he said he will have someone bring us there and even help with our luggage, which was very convenient).:) Ginza is relatively near, either you walk there, but we preferred taking the train. Lastly, it was great that Kitchen Street and Ramen Street were very near as this hotel was also at Tokyo Station.:) Lastly, forgot to mention that it is quite convenient that there are 3 possible entrances to the hotel.Cons: Just the room size, but everything else made up for it. We stayed at a Dome King (which had a view of the Dome of the station which was interesting, though you cannot really keep the curtains wide open, hehe) for 2 nights and at a Queen room for 3 nights. Rooms were around the same size, the Dome King just had a bigger bed and different view (Queen room had a street view, could see Kitte across the street). Some people might complain about how far some of the rooms are from the elevators, but really, what do you expect from the architecture of the building, it's not a high rise structure.","Muntinlupa, Philippines","Mirzky</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Muntinlupa, Philippines</strong>",14,5.0

Not only were they obviously extremely well-trained and professional, everyone we met was really warm and friendly! Allow me to give a couple of illustrations:- While still planning for the trip, we were looking to make a reservation at a popular restaurant for our final night in Tokyo. We therefore took a chance and wrote to the hotel to see if they may be able to help us make the reservation. Even though we would only be staying in the absolute cheapest room(!), the staff that communicated with us (Ms Marie Antoinette Mori, who, we found out later, happened to be the Chief Concierge!) was so friendly, professional and efficient. We have never come across any other member of hotel staff that even came close.- Shortly after checking in, a very friendly lady showed us to our room. Having heard our questions earlier at the reception desk regarding the location of various restaurants, she took the time to explain to us (in very good English) the lay of the land and the best way to walk through the labyrinth that is Tokyo Station to where we wanted to go. She really could just have shown us to the room, said a polite good-bye and walked away, yet she chose to stay and made an effort to help us.What can we say!

The location is super convenient, right next to (and above) Tokyo Station. There is excellent food in the Marunouchi area and the Kitte shopping mall next door has a great selection of shops with interesting things to buy. I just completed by third stay at this hotel. The service is top-notch and the staff speak good English. The rooms are new and luxurious with premium toiletries. The beds are comfortable and I did not notice any noise from the train station (I have stayed at both the Classic and Palace Side rooms). Complimentary bottled water is in the fridge, which is perfect as I don't like drinking water at room temperature.During this stay, I hiked up Mt. Fuji, with a stay at the Tokyo Station Hotel before and after my hike. Marie Antoinette Mori, Chief Concierge, helped book my stay at the Gouraikoukan (mountain hut near the summit of Mt. Fuji). Gouraikoukan is very difficult to book as it is the hut closest to the summit, but Ms. Mori managed to book us 3 places at the hut and also arranged our dinner/breakfast choices. She is super efficient and friendly. The price of this hotel is very reasonable and much lower than hotels in the same category. The prime location makes this hotel even a better deal as you will save time to and from the hotel. I have previously stayed at the Conrad, Park Hyatt and Four Seasons Marunouchi - but my new favorite is the Tokyo Station Hotel. Being able to get off the train/subway and straight into your hotel is great!

This hotel is very nice and our room was very nice. Decorated to a high standard definitely. We stayed on the Palace side to help lower the noise of the very active train station. Although we could still hear/feel the trains it wasn't so loud that it interfered with our sleep although total exhaustion from the very long flight was probably very influential in our ability to sleep.Although the room was a bit small per our ""Western"" standards, we still had plenty of room for our suitcases and moving about the room. It was very nicely appointed, I believe it was remodeled not long ago. Extremely clean as were all the hotels we stayed in while in Japan. The bathroom had all the amenities, toothbrush, toothpaste, blowdryer, hair brush, Q-tips all that kinda thing as do many hotels in Japan, a wonderful touch actually. Very nice towels, wonderful bathtub and shower, all stone and glass, lovely for sure.I didn't attach any pictures of the room because there are plenty already available on TA and the hotel website. I did add some pictures of the breakfast area (The Atrium I believe) which was beautiful and the breakfast spread from traditional Japanese to Western breakfast was wonderful. Tremendous selection and everything was top notch, totally loved it!Although we stayed only one night we were treated to a wonderful staff and many spoke English. My wife was born in Japan and thankfully speaks wonderful Japanese but it was nice that the staff spoke English to me.Be prepared to walk through very long halls, remember this is a train station... train stations are often quite large and LONG, this one's no exception, but the halls are nicely decorated and patrolled (thankfully) by security guards, nice touch, felt very secure.Be aware that if you only speak English you'll probably do OK in large cities like Tokyo but know that once you get away from cities of that size you'll have issues if you don't know a little Japanese. The train schedules are subtitled in English....to a degree, you have to pay very close attention and allow time to connect and even get lost from time to time.....also know that when they say the train doors close in one minute they are NOT kidding, do not ignore the schedule because the trains run on time, unless there's some off the wall emergency, truly the trains are on time so keep out of the doorway when the train is getting ready to leave, trust me on this point!Also, if you're going to spend a lot of time traveling by train, purchase the rail pass, it's great and most of your travels will be via Japan Rail (JR), your pass will apply for most trains but on occasion you'll need to take a local train that your pass will not cover and you'll have to pay for that portion of your travels. You must exit through a gate manned by JR employees, often times a sign at their window will read ""Fare Adjustment"", always show them your pass, they will nicely bow and thank you, you must do this, your pass will not work in any automated machine. But the train system is fantastic, subway included, just pay attention and allow proper time to make connections etc...Carry coins with you, you'll need these for the train and bus which you'll need to take on occasion unless your not concerned about the cost of taxis, you can really expend some funds if you take taxis all the time, on occasion you just may have to but do try to avoid the cost. Taxis are great in Japan, always very clean although you may run into more than one that has been smoked in, smokers are still a problem in Japan, no where near what it used to be and it is getting better all the time, still you'll need to be aware of hotel rooms that say its a non smoking room, but check it right when you check in, if it stinks of smoke you can try to get another room right then, don't wait.....give it a try anyway, they may not be able to accommodate you but perhaps they can as well, ask nicely.Always carry a cotton handkerchief with you, not all bathrooms have any kind of towels or hand dryers provided, it's the only way you can dry your hands after using the bathroom. Also know that you may not always be using Western style toilets...do yourself a favor, research this on the internet, be prepared to utilize ""different"" style of toilets....all very interesting.Sorry to rattle on but these are several little tips that really make traveling in Japan, or many parts of the world for that matter, a LOT more comfortable.Avoid being rude and stupid.......be polite and respectful and thats' exactly what you'll get in return.","Monroe, New Jersey","garryo8893</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Monroe, New Jersey</strong>",128,4.0

Unbelievable service. Canadian hotels should take note!! We enjoyed it so much that we rebooked a room again the night before we were to fly out to New Zealand. There were no Classic rooms left so we did have to pay extra, but the room was twice the size and both times we were upgraded to a view of the city. Again impeccable service.

The short answer - I was totally blown away by the experience. (As a benchmark, I have stayed in top hotels and ryokans in Japan, so I know the level of hospitality the Japanese can go to!) First impressions: There are two entrances to the hotel; the main one is from the street or taxi drop-off area, and the other one is from the JR station. We entered from the latter, and were greeted by many bellboys (or bellgirls! They look really cute with their little hats) which made us feel very welcomed. The concierge was courteous, warm and friendly, and promptly showed us where we were with maps of the area. Check-in was 3pm and since we arrived earlier they took our suitcases and stored them. By the time we came back at 3:30pm, all the suitcases were in the room waiting for us! We had someone to show us to the room (typical in Japan), and he even gave us a little history of the place. Room:Our room was the dome room which is slightly larger than the others along the corridor. However this doesn't mean that there is a dome in the room - it just means that the window looks out to the great dome in the Tokyo Station. It was pretty cool watching the people walking about below, some of them gawking at the dome above. If you like natural light filtering into your window then don't choose the dome room; however I have to admit that looking over one of the busiest stations in the world from your hotel room is pretty hard to beat.The room was smaller than I expected, but the very high ceilings made up for it. It has everything I need and wanted, and then some. There is a JBL iPod speaker but it works only with the older iPods and iPhones. Everything looks spanking new and polished, as if you are the very first guest there. Bathroom:The bathroom really shines here. The shower area is right next to the bathtub, onsen style, so it's a very, very large ""wet area"" - a treat in Tokyo when bathrooms are usually small. Water pressure is strong, toiletries from Gilchrist & Soames, plenty of other toiletries provided. Toilet was the typical Japanese ones which means you have a warm seat every time you use the loo. Location: What can one say about the location except that it is perfect? Even the Mandarin Oriental doens't have a location as good as this. The Imperial Palace is right across the road (some rooms have views of the Palace), and you are at the station which goes to Narita airport on the NEX line. Daimaru (at Gran Tokyo) is also a 5-minute walk away (this can be confusing as you have to navigate the passageways through Tokyo Station, but once you get it, it's easy), and there are so many shops and restaurants at Tokyo Station, you will never be bored or go hungry. Roppongi and Asakusa is just around the corner. Tsukiji Fish Market is a 5-minute taxi ride away (about JPY1200) or 30 minutes on foot. Service:Flawless. I think the only few places which beat this is Ugenta ryokan in Kyoto, and the Mandarin Oriental in Tokyo.Cons:The room may feel small for some people. There are some rooms which can be very far from the elevators so be prepared for a long walk. That said, it does make the corridor look really impressive!I am a very light sleeper so even though the soundproofing is top-notch, I can still pick up a bit of noise.","Hong Kong, China","greenflubber</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",162,5.0

I was emailed back a signed letter in PDF which confirmed that the booking had been made in my name and to let them know if any other further reservations were required.

Also a big thanks to the team in helping us to pre-arranging the skytree packages for us which allow us to go up to the top in the very morning without queuing up at the ticket counter, and so lucky we also have a fine weather that day morning, and we, as the early bird, did get the worm to have the luck to see the Mt. Fuji on the skytree top, with excellent visibility. It was really our luck to have them to arrange all these for us. We also purchased a total of six packages of different products from the amazon.co.jp and asked them to deliever to the Hotel before we check in. The team in the Hotel just followed very closely on all my purchase ordered and inform me promptly whenever any one of them has arrived, giving me the greatest level of peace of mind. And of course I have to mention the Strawberry Cake, and top grade fresh strawberry and the Champagne that have been pre-arranged at our request were all wonderfully prepared, and the team was so thoughtful that they included a molten chocolate bath for our strawberry without us asking for such in advance! We did have a very joyful and excited Christmas Eve that night, thanks to all of their hard work in getting us to this point. The hotel itself was the best heritage hotel that I have stayed in so far, though the room is of a smaller size but with the limitation of the heritage building itself these are surely one of its own characteristic. The shower and the water pressure were both excellent and very comfortable, the rain shower was the best that I have used ever, with the powerful waterfall engulfing your whole body, and you never want to get out of that rain shower for sure once you are in. The temperature control of the shower was as precise as you want, with every little turn of the temperature knob it gives you a very precise change in temperature, it was so comfortable. Our last minute (really a last mintue as I only asked for that the day before our departure to Tokyo) request for a hotel transfer was also arranged flawlessly and that have enabled us to reach to Tokyo downtown much earlier than planned and allowed some free time for us to have a drink on the 7/F of New 丸の内 building before coming back for the in-room Christmas Eve celebration. You won't be disappointed with all these and I would highly recommend anyone travelling to Tokyo to consdier this Hotel. They are located right on top of the Tokyo Station, a station that could lead you to anywhere in Japan as it is the mecca of all trains in Japan. The sound proof of the room was really good given the proximity of the heavy train traffic just downstair and I can tell you that you won't feel or hear the train noise at all. The bed sheet was smooth enough, the bed was about right (though not the best that I have tried before), and there was free wi-fi, an i-phone dock (for those who use galaxy, you can jsut purchase a samdock, which I did, from amazon which will give you the access capability to use the i-phone dock same as if you have an iphone), the temperature control was excellent as well. There is also a humidity control unit which you can use to add on some humidity to the room as it would be dry in Japan during winter time. There were two bottles of chilled complimentary water in the fridge for you to use. There are just so many that I can't list them out one by one and you have to try this and experince this wonderful experience while you are in Tokyo. I didn't use the spa and fiteness facilities so I cannot comment on those but I have taken a quick view of the site which is very good indeed. There are also a lot of restaurant of the Hotel in B1F that you can try. For sure I am totally satisfied with this Hotel and next time if I am in Tokyo for an overnight stay, this one would be my top choice.","Hong Kong, China","HKA_888</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",115,5.0

Tokyo probably has more luxury hotels than any other city in the world and any of the top level hotels would have been great. Plus, this being Japan, the level of service is unrivalled. No other country comes close.However, I didn't want to stay in yet another generic 5 star hotel in a shiny gleaming skyscraper (not that there's anything wrong with that) but I wanted somewhere with character.And so I booked into The Tokyo Station Hotel.Believe the hype, believe the reviews, believe the ads - it really is truly amazing, extraordinary and an experience to remember.The interior design looks like a classier, more understated Gatsby aesthetic of Art Deco mixed with modern sensibilities. I had the Palace side Queen sized bedroom on level 3 and it was beautifully and stylishly furnished. And the bathroom - the most amazing bathroom I have seen, with a huge bath separate to the shower area (the wet section of the bathroom is enclosed in clear glass). Toiletries are Gilchrist and Soames, like Shangri-la.Located directly above the Tokyo Station, a stone's throw from the Imperial Palace and the Marunouchi district, ten minutes walking distance to Ginza and 50 minutes from Narita - no other hotel has the perfect location for the leisure traveller or the busy businessman. As one of the major stops on the JR Yamanote line, as well as the hub for the shinkansen and the Narita Express (NEX), Tokyo literally is at your doorstep.There's countless bars and restaurants in the station (this being Japan, there's an extensive network of underground shopping centres within the station) and they stay open til late!But if you are a romantic tragic, you cannot miss the chance to see a living legend in action - head to the hotel's Oak Bar and experience the legendary bartender, Mr Hisashi Sugimoto, work the bar like it's 1959. The Oak Bar is furnished very much like a private club but its surprisingly not an intimidating place - I went by myself and there were two other groups of females all kicking back with a drink. As an aside, if you're a cocktail afficionado, Tokyo is the city to be. The city is full of passionate bartenders of the old school variety who have dedicated their lives to perfecting the art of the martini. The highlight of the hotel was definitely the customer service - I could tell that all staff were drilled to the highest standards and no request was impossible. Efficient, courteous, friendly and impeccable - to the Tokyo Station staff (especially the fabulous concierge staff), I truly loved you all.The buffet breakfast at the atrium is exclusivity defined - only hotel guests can access this - and it was one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. As always, my general rule is to eat the local cuisine of the country you're visiting, so I skipped the western bacon-and-eggs-and-hot-meal part of the buffet and went straight to the Japanese side. And was promptly in heaven.The hotel has a spa and fitness complex but due to time constraints I was unable to try them out. There are a number of cheap and cheerful reflexology and massage places in the underground shopping centre and I highly recommend them. Note that the Imperial Palace is closed on Mondays! I forgot to read the fine print in my Lonely Planet and turned up at the gates bright and early on a Monday - and walked away empty handed. Here's some practical information:1) The Tokyo Station is on the Yamanote Line. Because the Yamanote Line is a circle, it takes just over an hour to do a full loop. And the Yamanote Line leaves Tokyo Station (and any other station on the line) every 2-3 minutes.2) Tokyo Station is at 4 o-clock. This means Shibuya (where Hachiko statue and the dance clubs are located) is at the 8 o-clock mark. Which means that it takes approximately 20 minutes to travel between Tokyo Station and Shibuya. Shinjuku is at 10 o'clock which means it takes approximately 30 minutes to travel from Tokyo to Shinjuku.3) If you're a fashion and shopping tragic, the best places to hit shopping are Ginza (for the usual luxury offerings) and Shinjuku (where the grand department stores are located). But I highly recommend Shinjuku particularly the little side streets and alleys just outside the train station. Oh my God - ever wanted to buy a Birkin, or Louis Vuitton for a fraction of the price - then hit the Duty Free Stores. Don't be shy, just go inside - all the staff are nice and friendly - and shop how the pros shop. Don't ever pay retail again. Some of the stuff are second hand, some are brand new - but all of them are authentic. And again, this being Japan, the second had stuff still look almost brand new. This is even better than ebay. 4) It makes life so much easier if your hotel is situated on one of the Yamanote line stops. However, note that many train stations in Tokyo are interconnected - for example, JR Yurakucho station is a stop on the JR Yamanote line, but what most travellers don't realise is that Yurakucho is just a 5 minutes walk to Ginza and Hibiya! This means that if your hotel is in Hibiya (literally on the other side of the tracks from Ginza) then you don't have to change trains if you're on the Ginza line - just walk to the Yurakucho station and you're on the Yamanote line straight away! Same thing for Shiodome station - it is not on the Yamanote line but it is connected to JR Shimbashi which is on the Yamanote line, just walk 5-10 minutes underground through a shopping centre.To the JR East Company and the Tokyo governor/mayor who had a vision of restoring this grand hotel to this former glory, and to the current staff and management who make the dream a reality, I salute you.","Canberra, Australia","LAG2612</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",45,5.0

I had asked for a dome room with a view overlooking the concourse of the train station, and I was assigned just the room I wanted. I've probably described this in an earlier review, but this one was slightly different than the other one, in that it seemed a little larger. Other than that, though, it was just what I wanted it to be. It had an extremely high ceiling, bathroom amenities including a Toto ""Washlet"" toilet that does just about everything for you, including raising the lids, flushing automatically and ""cleaning you off"" when you're through. The only thing different from the one I have at home (it's hard to imagine life without one when you've first enjoyed it) was that there was no ""dryer."" The bed was huge, soft and with a huge amount of pillows that made you feel as if you were an oriental potentate. Despite being right at the largest train station in Tokyo, you never heard a sound, even though announcements are going on literally right outside your window, and screaming kids are running around all over the place, not to mention the huge holiday crowds. I forgot to mention that the bathtub/shower area is just special. The tub is large and deep, so you have an almost ""onsen"" like experience. Then there is the shower, which is right next door to the tub, and it has an elegant ""rain"" shower head. It's hard to decide which is the more decadent.The hotel itself is ""old-time"" luxurious, with high ceilings, deep carpets, long hallways, and it takes you back to an era of (I almost hate to say it again) luxury that is sadly lacking in most hotels.I opted for the ""breakfast package"" which included a daily trip to their fantastic ""atrium"" where a huge and lavish array of wonderful foods was in evidence. Everything you could possibly want or need (and a few things you probably wouldn't) was there: meats, pastries, salads, soups, etc. (I don't want to take the space talking about all of them) and an on-site chef who whipped up tasty omelets. In short, it would be hard to find another breakfast as super as this!All in all, it was a welcome return for me, and I vowed I would always stay here when I return to Tokyo for at least part of my trip. Anyone who wants a perfect stay in Tokyo need head no farther (if one is arriving by train) than this sensational hotel.","Kaneohe, Hawaii","Whitsiepoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaneohe, Hawaii</strong>",164,5.0

It was cold and had started to rain so we cut through the building to get to the train station. It was an old, old barn with the widest hall on the 2nd floor I have ever seen in any hotel anywhere.Since then JR East has spent a large fortune restoring the hotel, adding a 3rd and 4th floor which we burned out in 1945 in the fire raids and restored the original two domes. The central hall was reduced in width allowing the palace side rooms to be enlarged to rather long rectangular shape, new everything, beautifully ""restored"" and refurbished. It is a joy to see what can be done with an old building and lots and lots of money.We stayed in room 3066, a superior twin room with a bare view of the palace grounds. My only complaint is that the wing chair was not comfortable for reading, the sofa was fine. Beds were great, quiet despite overlooking the very busy front taxi arrival area. We ate a light dinner at the Toraya Resturant on the 2nd floor, had a vegetarian dinner assorted steamed vegetables over rice with a ponzu sauce which to my surprise was excellent. My only criticism is that the green tea which I ordered with the after dinner sweet was not of the same quality as was served at the Toraya shop in the basement of Mid-Town Center. That was tea to go back for again and again. We went out walking afterwards to see the lights in Marunouchi 2 blocks west of the hotel. On our return we had a beer and an apple soda in the 1st floor lounge. Good service, not inexpensive, but it is Tokyo.The breakfast is an additional fee of 2,000 yen per person, but it is a very elaborate buffet of western and Japanese dishes of which I ate more than I should have. Excellent food and excellent service in a nice setting.Note, this hotel is built along side of the railroad tracks and stretches for about 300 yards, so you may wind up with quite a bit of a hike from one of the two elevators to your room. Such is life. The building dates to about 1906 was completed in 1914, burned out in 1945, closed in 2007 for a 6 year revovation/restoration. There are newer western style hotels in the city generally more expensive, but for a trip back in time at the most central location in all of Tokyo this is the place to stay.Oh, for giggles, go to the 2nd floor where you can overlook the rotundas at the North and South Marunouchi entrances to the station. Better than the scramble across the intersection at Shibuya, trust me.","La Mesa, California","Ted C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Mesa, California</strong>",249,5.0

This review can not possibly express the pleasure of our stay. I can't imagine our vacation being better had we stayed elsewhere. Getting to Tokyo Station from Narita is simple. Once you get into Tokyo station, it does take a little work to find the hotel. Following signs and asking, as others has posted, helps. Still, with no need to drag luggage into a cab, you can't beat the convenience, especially once you start to use the metro/trains for sightseeing. The station has everything you need, though it takes a little work to navigate your way around (which can be frustrating). Tokyo Station Ramen Street was an especially convenient place to go coming back to the hotel after sightseeing. Also, about a block away, are many high rises with dozens of shops, restaurants, coffee shops, and small grocery stores on the basement floor. With kids, this provided us with every convenience we might need, often without ever needing to go outside (there are tunnels from the Tokyo station underground that lead into these buildings). On to the hotel. I don't know where to start....The staff is remarkable. Let's start there. The staff could not have been more gracious during our entire stay. We felt so welcomed from the start and by the end of our trip we felt like the staff was family. I must also recognize Ms. Mori. Even before we arrived, she helped to not only secure me Pocket WIFI (which I highly recommend) but several restaurant reservations. Then, during our stay, she helped us with other reservations, sightseeing suggestions, and friendly conversation. Additionally, she has the insight to provide the kids little gifts upon our arrival back 'home' several times, making it far easier to 'parent' after a long day of sightseeing. The hotel provides PJs for all guests. Every night, the entire family would come home to pressed Pajama shirts. The kids' shirts had Shinkansen bullet trains embroidered, and our kids couldn't wait to get into them each night. It was very hard not to steal them at the end of our trip! The hotel also provided, in addition to all the great toiletries, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and shinkensen cups for the kids.The Hotel. It is beautiful. Obviously, the facade is a landmark. Inside, the hotel is flawless. Everything has been redone to perfection. It is very modern and remarkably well designed and exceptionally clean. I agree with others, there are some long, long hallways, but this is a minor criticism. The Room. We stayed in a Dome King. It is sound proof. We opted for this because we wanted to see the station below us, a unique experience. Watching all the salary men and women going to work each morning and leaving each evening served as bonus entertainment. One night, with the kids asleep, we were entertained by a young man trying to coerce a women to join him on a train ride home, while the rest of the station was empty (he failed). For some, the rooms may be small. For us, the Dome King was great. We are used to sleeping with our kids in a King Bed on vacation. There was plenty of room for the kids to play in front of the bed on the floor with toys. The bathroom is great. The shower is huge and has an amazing rainfall shower head in the middle, along with an adjacent tub. The toilet has all the expected Japanese features, including a heated seat. Our kids were disappointed to leave the Tokyo toilets.Restaurants: We were never disappointed in the restaurants (sorry, forget the names, but you'll know what I mean). We ate in the sushi restaurant with my wife's aunt, who lives in Tokyo. Since we had the kids, we secured a private room. The sushi was wonderful, and the service was outstanding. Next, we ate at the Irish restaurant. I had the Shepard's Pie, fantastic, along with a Guinness Draft,while my wife raved about the fish and 'crisps.' The staff mentioned that they brought members of the Irish Consulate in to try the food before the restaurant launched. During that dinner, our waitress from the sushi restaurant from the night before came over to say hello and wanted to take pictures with our kids. As a parent, this sort of thing really makes you feel welcome. The atrium breakfast is not to be missed. It has a phenomenal selection, ranging from traditional Japanese fare to omelets, meats, pastry, and fruits. And the brioche french toast was amazing. It is a high end breakfast in, though and amazing space, a surprisingly relaxed environment.Also, I should mention the Oak Bar, where I stopped, unfortunately, oncet. Great little bar...intimate, with a Japanese Whiskey, along with a surprisingly good selection of international whiskey and US bourbon. Well, that is my take. Sorry for the delay getting it out. I guess I'll conclude by saying that when I come back to Tokyo, I'll stay at Tokyo Station Hotel. I had a long stay there with my family and at the end of the trip I felt really sad to leave the hotel and the people who worked there","Honolulu, Hawaii","JKJKJKEK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",7,5.0

From the moment my husband and I stepped off the Narita Express train, two of the hotel's staff members were waiting for us outside of the train car (a free service which they provide if you request it). They took our luggage right away and began to guide us through the labyrinth that is the massive Tokyo Station. The staff's English was very good and they were friendly and helpful. Once we checked in without a hitch one of the nice ladies who met us at the station escorted us up to our room and gave us a complete tour of the room's amenities as well as directions to best navigate our way in, out, and around the hotel. Honestly, service from a hotel doesn't get better than this.The room itself is gorgeous. The space is generally what you would expect in Tokyo, a bit small but not at all cramped or uncomfortable. The room (as well as the halls, lobby, Atrium, etc.) is tastefully decorated. Everything from the marble floors, wainscoting, molding, color scheme, artwork, was thoughtfully arranged. The style is kept true to the era of the original hotel but remodeled with all the comforts of modern living. They did an impeccable job of combining style and function and packing it all into a small hotel room. The queen size bed was comfortable, pillows were nice and the space was very clean. The bathroom is similarly pleasing to the eye and very functional. We had breakfast buffet at the Atrium (pricey, $32 per person). The atmosphere of the Atrium is simply beautiful. The food is tasty and the spread is quite respectable for both the western and Japanese cuisine selections. While quite expensive for breakfast, I recommend trying it if you have some spare coin and time. It's a very enjoyable meal and a lovely, calm, satisfying way to begin a day in Tokyo.

The two reasons we stayed here were that we had a relatively early flight when we came back to the UK and wanted to be conveniently located for the Narita Express and that we wanted to end on a high with a great hotel.The hotel itself is stunning and very comfortable. There are a few reasons though that I haven't awarded them an excellent rating. Firstly, the layout is not great and we were in a room that was a very long walk from the elevators and reception. Secondly, the atmosphere is very elegant but almost too elegant. The lobby bar was dead by 8:30pm and trying to get a drink proved almost impossible in the hotel. We had one evening where we went to one of the bars and despite seeing 6 people leave they refused to let us in, claiming they were full!The staff are very nice and English is widely spoken (if that's important to you) but I don't know if I'd stay here again as it was very staid and I felt as if I was 40 years to young to be there. It's also very expensive (although we got a very good deal through Expedia) and I think for the amount of money that you need to stay there I'd have been disappointed if we hadn't managed to get a discount.Overall it was good and a lovely end to our vacation.

It's a terrific city and I look forward to each trip there, even though it entails very long flights. Usually, my hotel of choice is the decidedly ordinary Excel Shibuya, only because it is near my work, located at the buzzy Shibuya crossroads/Mark City Building, and close to the utterly cool Aoyama-Omotesando neighborhoods. This time I also booked three nights at the Tokyo Station Hotel in eager anticipation of checking into the newly opened (since 2012), totally renovated, low-rise old station in and amidst the high rises of post-war central Tokyo. It's a very beautiful architecture and has indeed been attentively restored and outfitted. The neighborhood is quiet and well-situated for the Museum of Modern Art and the Imperial Palace compound. But I wouldn't call the hotel wonderful by any means. Service is delivered in a nervous and awkward manner by the numerous bellhop-clad greeters stationed about. (If the one person on duty who speaks English happens to be taking a tea break, good luck getting a map of the area from the others.) The room on the 2nd floor was long-ish, narrow, and over furnished for the space. Out the beautiful French window was the entrance to the hotel below, and that meant looking upon a truly ugly arrangement of taxis wound around and around to serve the entire train station; in other words, no grand or green entrance to match a grand hotel. Japanese friends were also surprised by the unsightly taxi arrangement, as well as the small and undistinguished reception area of the hotel. It's quite a hike from the elevator to most of the rooms, and if you want to access the numerous restaurants attached to the hotel, hike back to another elevator and descend to the dreary basement, or hike to the access door to more restaurants from the second floor (and then possibly get stuck outside if the keycard fails to let you in again.) The massage I booked in the room via reception --in order to avoid the long trek to the basement facility --was quite good when it finally happened: the masseuse was nearly a half hour late, and only after I phoned the front desk to inquire did she appear. Another inconvenience: to enter the main station from the hotel for a little bite to eat or to check train schedules is no easy matter: one must walk out the front entrance and around the length of the building (in the rain, in this case) to enter via the one hallway available without buying a train or subway ticket first. Finally, Tokyo is more than a little pricey, as everyone knows. In this case, the room was $500 and the one room-service breakfast I shared with my husband (one order between us) was more than $40. Yes, the Marunouchi Building shopping is great, and yes, the grand Ginza area is in walking distance; and there is a wonderful array of traditional Japanese eating places lining the street in-between. But will I return to the Tokyo Station Hotel for these, or just hop the Yamanote line to get there for an afternoon of shopping and eating?

Bathroom was large with an enormous deep tub and the most amazing shower. Plenty of nice quality bathroom amenities.Service at the Hotel was excellent. They had my room ready by 1pm even thought check in was officially 3pm which was much appreciated after a long flight. When I had a problem with a tour company the desk spoke to them on the phone on my behalf and sorted out the arrangements. All of the staff I met were very helpful, seemed rightly very proud of their beautiful hotel and genuinely pleased to welcome you. Housekeeping was excellent. Room was alway immaculate. Bedding was clean and comfortable. Really enjoyed my stay and especially liked he character of the hotel.

But something was missing? Maybe it's the hushed tones of the Japanese clientele that threw me a bit. Location superb all the main line and underground station right underneath you.

Finally, a central Tokyo hotel that is not a generic steel and glass tower. Newly refurbished, the hotel still has some bugs to work out.

From the Tokyo station JR entrance, where most will arrive, you are on your own with your luggage for the long and confusing walk to the reception desk. What others have said about getting to one's room is true: It can take five minutes of walking, if you don't get lost; and it is easy to get lost. Better signage would help.Certainly convenient for rail travelers, but take care not to arrive on a late train if you are staying here. Most of the station concessions will be closed; and there is nothing in the way of food on the streets within walking distance to the hotel, as the surrounding area is the financial district, which closes tightly at night. We arrived at JR station at 10:00 p.m. and ended up dining in the hotel bar, which had a rudimentary and outrageously priced menu of what turned out to be frozen/microwaved western fare.Overall, it was a good stay for the money, and perfect for JR/Narita Express travelers, provided that you do not arrive too late.","Hagatna, Mariana Islands","lat13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hagatna, Mariana Islands</strong>",112,4.0

The location is definitely a plus for business and leisure travelers alike, particularly for those who are very much obsessed with the plethora of dining and shopping within the station below.

Also, the long corridors on the 2nd or 3rd floors (where most guest rooms are) are punctuated by some exhibition areas, where you can enjoy the exclusive interior view of the dome overlooking the entrance to JR.Guests can enjoy utmost privacy when returning to the hotel as there are some secondary entrances (very far from the lobby yet much closer to your room) where only those with room keys can tap on some sensor to unlock the doors to the elevators. The rooms are spacious with European decor and high ceilings. The bed is firm yet comfortable with large bedside tables. The bathroom is large with the toilet in its own cubicle separate from the bathtub or shower. Unlike the dim rooms in many other hotels, these rooms are amply lit.

Equal in all respects to those great dames of the past, just meandering around the huge property made you feel as if a duke, duchess or emperor might appear just around the corner!I read many of the other reviews for this hotel and have trouble understanding any of the negative remarks. Of course I understand that people have different tastes and experiences, but in all ways I found my experience here to be top rate.I think I must have stayed in the same ""Dome"" room as some of the other reviewers, because I found the same amenities and furnishings, including the crystal chandeliers, the huge and wonder ""rain"" shower and the separate ""personal"" room with the porcelain ""throne."" No one mentioned, though, that this ""throne"" was one of the technical marvels of the bathroom age, a Toto ""Washlet"" that does everything for you when you ""use"" the facility except powder your bottom. No need to even touch the thing! From raising the lid to flushing and lowering it, and everything in between, this is truly a marvel of the age, and something really special. I would like the ""not so"" Grand Hyatt hotel in New York to come and learn something about great hotel bathrooms!I didn't notice anyone's commenting on the lovely spa downstairs. I didn't use all their services, but just visiting the Japanese style bath (I was told you can't call it an onsen because they don't have natural mineral water being piped up from under the ground) made for a very relaxing experience. As I'm sitting in my room right now, I believe I'll be making a quick trip down there for an invigorating soak when I finish this.So I basically have to agree with all the good comments that were made about this hotel, from the ""surprisingly quiet"" comment to ""Great Hotel in the heart of the city.""

This makes things very handy, not just for international comings and going, but also for domestic train journeys as Tokyo station is a main hub. As for the hotel, rooms are brand new and, while not huge, the height of the ceilings make the room feel very spacious. For us, one particularly memorable plus was the concierge desk. As well as being completely fluent in English (not a given), one gentleman on the desk was kind enough upon seeing me walk into the hotel to hand me a print out of a map showing me the directions of how to get to a restaurant I had asked him to book earlier that morning. I've never had this kind of thoughtful service, even at some of the most famous hotels who are supposedly known for their service. That aside, the hotel is also convenient if on business as it's in the business district and also next to Ginza if you want some high end shopping. If you want hip and happening (like my last visit), try Shinjuku. If you want something more refined, try here.","Hong Kong, China","RM303</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",190,5.0

Recently renovated. Excellent staff service. You need a train pass to conveniently walk to the main underground mall which is connected to it. If you dont have a train pass, you can purchase one. Not expensive, but a weird arrangement. The hotel rooms are not large, but they had to fit in the existing historical building, so can't really complain. Beds and linen excellent. The huge rain shower in the bathroom is reason enough to stay there. Location is within Tokyo Station. Surroundings mostly office buildings so not much touristy things to do there, but go underground and there are countless shops and restaurants. Ginza is 10 minutes walk away, Imperial Palace 8 minutes walk.","Singapore, Singapore","EYeo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",62,5.0

This is not only Japan, it's Marunouchi after all. But the tall ceilings mitigate any sense of oppression and the gorgeous appointments in the room quickly transport you to a state of luxury and refinement. The artwork hanging in the corridors is a nice touch reminding guests of the historical significance of the place. Even if you're not splurging on one of their DOME rooms, you can stroll over to one of the little observation areas (I think there are 3 on each floor). Here you can enjoy the view down into the station rotunda that would otherwise cost you an extra Y10,000. Squint hard and you might even be able to see the markers indicating the spots where 2 prime ministers were assassinated. Service in Japanese hotels is consistently top-notch, but here it is elevated to an exceptional level. One feels compelled to tip, but Japan has done just fine without that custom. Let's not corrupt them. By Japanese standards, I would give this hotel perfect scores across the board, but international guests might not consider it an excellent value and the rooms might feel a bit cramped and thus the deducted points.","Los Angeles, CA","surfhag</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",12,5.0

It doesn't matter whether it is the restrooms, elevators or certainly the lounges, don't plan to get in and out in a hurry or even slowly.Though everything was new and shiny, our room was slightly larger than a closet at many of the grand old hotels. For what it is worth, the ceilings were very high. I kept picturing being in an experiment to see if vertical height made up for floor space, and for me it didn't. I like to be able to open a suitcase without forcing the other person to climb on the bed or stand in the bathroom. Detracting further from the overall experience was the view was of a side of a building. Perhaps we were just unlucky and got the only really lousy room, but we did not experience the truly minimal size elsewhere in Japan or even at the other Tokyo hotels and ryokans I stayed at during other trips. The good news is we were happy to stay there one night and now can choose not to stay there again.","Meriden, NH","Dinnaah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Meriden, NH</strong>",49,2.0
