That means you get a bed, a bathroom, breakfast and a quick-checkout in morning for a reasonable price. The breakfast is very simple. You can choose between a western style and a japanese style version. it is nothing fancy but a good start into the day.THE ROOM is a little bit small and only provides the basics: a clean bed and a clean bathroom. But this is all you need, if you stay for on one (or even two) nights. THE LOCATION is perfect for people who have an early flight from Haneda airport or arrive late at night. The hotel is only one train station away from the International Terminal. The hotel also provides a free shuttle bus to the airport in the morning. The train station (Tenkubashi Station) is approx. 300m away from the hotel, and therefore in walking distance even with heavy baggage. There are two train lines available: Keikyu Airport Line and Tokyo Monorail. Both are connecting Haneda Airport with the Yamanote ring; Shinagawa Station for the Keikyu line (some trains become the Toei Asakusa Subway Line and go further to the Sky Tree) and Shimbashi/Hamatsucho für the Monorail (Japan Rail Pass is valid).The hotel doesn't have a restaurant for dinner or a bar. There are not many places for that around the hotel and it is still 30min away from Tokyo city center. Therefore it may not be the best place to stay if you want to discovery Tokyo or if you are looking for a good nightlife time.I choose this hotel for the night before my flight back to Germany. My favorite hotel in Tokyo is close to Yushima Tenmangu and at least 90 min. from the airport. With this hotel I was not worried about rush hour congestion are getting connecting trains. Just breakfast, easy bus shuttle and baggage drop-off at the airport. All within these mentioned 90 min.CONCLUSION: This hotel is an ideal place to stay the night before an early flight from Haneda Airport or after arriving late.","Luebeck, Germany","Seidenpriester</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Luebeck, Germany</strong>",150,4.0

There are 2 airport hotels in haneda airport itself. Royal Park Haneda was very expensive for a twin bed room almost 25,000 ¥ for a night. The other first cabin hotel was something like a capsule.. Not suitable for families.We found keikyu ex Inn on trip advisor.. The distance to the airport /modern and well equipped room /free shuttle to airport attracted us to book 2 nights (we arrived on 25 May 1am and had to book 2 nights as our flight is leaving 26 May 6am. It was around $15000 JPY per night. The shuttle bus only operates in the morning to the airport (starts at 430am) and every 30mins there is 1.And in the evening from airport to hotel and last bus ends at 11pm. We had to take a cab to the hotel when we arrived at 1am, it was about 900¥. The rooms are big enough for japanese standards.. The twin beds are wider than usual (160cm wide) we push the beds together and it could sleep 4 of us comfortably. 2 adults 2 kids,The room has a clean and modern feel, the washroom is very clean too with a very modern and high tech wc. The beds are very comfortable.The hotel is a 5mins walk from the nearest train station and note that the walk to the station is uncovered so bring a brolly if is raining.You have to change lines if you are going towards Harajuku / Shibuya area. It takes about 45mins to reach downtown.The shuttle bus in the morning takes about 10mins to reach the domestic terminal in haneda. It gets fairly crowded in the morning so get down to the B1 level early to queue up for the bus. We took the 5am bus and there were already 8 people ahead of us at 450am. The bus can take about 25 pax and no reservations is allowed. You can check out in B1 too. Is an automated machine... Just slot in your key card.Only small grouse is the breakfast is not buffet breakfast and is very limited. Basically 2 choices.. Japanese or international and Japanese comes with a bowl of udon/some condiments and that's it. Small portions. But is OK for us. Not a deal breaker.This hotel is highly recommended for a short layover while you wait for your next flight at haneda based on my view and experience. If you are looking for a hotel so to visit downtown Tokyo for shibuya/harajuku /ueno/mejji/disney for a longer stay.. You should look elsewhere as it is not near to those places.","Singapore, Singapore","Jer75</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",34,5.0

Maybe the largest I've seen in Japan (but still small compared to the US). The hotel is fairly new, and is very clean and comfortable. On the negative size, the breakfast was not so good. The amount of food was small. A choice was provided between Japanese and Western, but the Western breakfast was more like ""less Japanese"".

We arrived in Haneda around 10pm and took the hotel shuttle from the airport to the hotel at 11:40. We flew in from Osaka so we flew in domestically. The shuttle was on time, quick and efficient. Unfortunately, there aren’t any 24/7 restaurants nearby and we were hungry. Luckily there are 7-Eleven vending machines on the second floor, the same floor as the front desk, in the breakfast room. The breakfast served the next morning was good too! They served a western choice or a Japanese choice. We opted for the western - bacon, eggs, butter and jellies, beef soup (?) and a custard. Random, but good enough. The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was nice. The toilet was very impressive. WiFi speed was strong! Also, being smokers, we really appreciated that there was an indoor smoking room located conveniently nearby the lobby. The front desk agent got a taxi for us quickly as well when we asked how to get a taxi. It was very appreciated! We definitely recommend this hotel. Everything was exceptional. From the basic toiletries offered in the lobby, to the convenient smoking room, the fresh coffee offered 24/7, this hotel was excellent. They thought of nearly everything to make their guests comfortable. I’d also like to add that I saw in previous reviews that there are not self service laundry facilities in this hotel, which is untrue.

The motel is on the edge of the airport and less than $10.00 AUD taxi fare. They do have a free shuttle bus from the airport but limited from the international one. The room is compact but there is enough room for suitcases and it is well laid out. It is also very clean and new looking and no noise can be heard from nearby aircraft. There are plenty of vending machines in the hotel including some that sell beer and sandwiches and snacks. The breakfast (included in room price) is a choice between western and Asian and is a good size meal. The hotel is well located near supermarkets and the train station. ,"Perth, Australia","JenandbrianPerthWA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",99,5.0

My husband chanced upon this new hotel that was opened in 2017 that was at a reasonable rate of S$130 per night per room for 2 persons which was 1 train station away. There is free shuttle from Haneda airport to the hotel if you arrive from 18:20 to 23:40 and depart from the hotel for the airport from 4:00 to 9:30. The room was very neat, clean and tidy with minimalist styling that was efficient. Lighting was good with sufficient brightness when required with ambient lighting available. Air conditioning and bath facilities were good and comfortable. Breakfast was simple but good with a choice of Western or Japanese. We had saba, vegetable soup, rice and pickles for our Japanese breakfast on the first morning. The walk to the train station is about 5 mins and it was very convenient to go down into the city. For the time we had, we managed to visit Shibuya, Harajuku, Ginza and Tsukiji. Checking in and out was efficient and convenient. The family was very satisfied with the comfortable stay we had.

It’s easy to get to on the Keikyu line (the last stop before the airport) and via the monorail then it’s a little walk to the hotel. You can see Haneda across the road it’s that close. Check in was fine and as I arrived early and wanted to sightsee in Tokyo I paid the extra ¥1100 per extra hour to check in. Although you can leave the luggage at the desk and check in later (I was just doing early check in for convenience) The lobby had free hot drinks and any hotel toiletries you may need. it’s a short walk to the nearest convenience store and there is also a local shrine that you can visit. But checking in and going back into Tokyo is easy enough if you want to make the most of your remaining time. The breakfast was not the best and is limited to Japanese or European option rather than a buffet so I wasted much of it. But that was down to my fussiness The room was spacious, although cool and I struggled with the gadgets (temperature and alarm) as both were in Japanese with not English interpretation as I’ve seen in other hotels. Lastly I was a solo traveller which means 1 pillow so I did have to ask for an extra which unfortunately was like a brick. So my last nights sleep was not the most comfortable as I was chilly and had very small and uncomfortable pillows. This hotel is brand new and although the staff were very helpful and polite the breakfast and comfort of the room let it down for me. I am not sure I would stay again as I have stayed in a more comfortable one 5 minutes up the road!this hotel also offered a free shuttle to Haneda terminals ","Nottingham, United Kingdom","cl41r3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nottingham, United Kingdom</strong>",45,4.0

Had two days and the night in between to see Tokyo. It’s located very well for Haneda Airport, but getting to Tokyo is a challenge (maybe I couldn’t grasp the system though). Official check in is at 3 pm, we arrived at 2.45 and we were made to wait till 3 pm by receptionist. We then noticed that many other people standing around were told the same. This seemed rather petty. Once we were able to access our room, it was clean, simple and fairly big given Tokyo standards. Bathroom was bit silly & was clearly a whole bathroom box fitted into the room. We were bit disturbed by people sleeping in the room next to us, seems walls are pretty thin. We didn’t wake up early enough to check the breakfast. Given this seems to be a brand new hotel, I’m sure they’ll sort bits and pieces to be better / given Tokyo prices and standards, it was still money very well spent. Oh, they provide limited airport transfer, which don’t matter much given it is one metro stop away from Haneda.

The hotel staff is nice and helpful, yet it took quite a bit of time to check it. You have to wait for at least 20 mins for check in if you are the last one to get out of the shuttle bus. There is a family mart just across the hotel; some eateries in walking distance so you won't be starving. Anyway the hotel provides simple breakfast. It is worthwhile as a transit hotel, which provides shuttle bus from the Airport. Just hope that the shuttle bus will extend its operating hours to and from the hotel. I would recommend this hotel.

They run a shuttle bus schedule every 30-minutes or so from domestic terminal, see my photo for times. Within the town of Haneda there are a few convenience stores, some bars and some Japanese restaurants, all with walking distance. There is a train station as well, plus monorail to get into central downtown Tokyo. From the hotel room you can get a nice view of the airport. RoomThe room was a double bed and since hotel is brand new it was spotless and modern. More generous in size compared to neighbouring hotels I have stayed at the mystay and JAL city. The double bed is comfy of good size and has special very comfortable pocket coil (similar to Airweave) mattress. It is designed for optimal comfort sleeping. Either side are helpful bedside tables with full room light switches & plug sockets Flexible personal reading lights well. Facing bed is the large desk area with a huge TV but unfortunetly couldn't find any international TV that wasn't in Japanese language only. There is a small fridge, kettle, air purifier and open wardrobe with coat hangers and mirror. A chair is also offered with small table. AC is remote controlled and above and is somewhat a little noisy. The bathroom is standard modern Japanese with deep short bath and shower. Shisedio amenities and most items such as dental kits etc. However at reception, they also offer a box with say vanity kits, mouthwash clothes dust remover sheet and even shower gel. Overall the business traveller room is fairly nice and spacious (for Japan) and has a great view of the airport. The comfortable bed is the highlight. FacilitiesThe hotel has personal routers for WIFI to each room and worked fast. In the lobby is a currency machine, plus a room with plenty of washer and dryers (takes 2 hours and costs 500 yen without need for clothes cleaner- very handy). You can give out iron's and ironing boards here but also on each floor I noticed trouser press to take to room etc. There is a smoking room and also free coffee machine plus teas in the lobby. No leisure facilities though. Various vending machines for drinks and even t-shirts in the washer room. Breakfast hall is near lobby in a sort of airline looking lounge that can be used anytime. there are 7-11 vending machines in there. Breakfast consists of either japanese meal tray (Mackeral and rice) or Western (Egg and ham with toast) - both with soup and choice of small bowl of beans or fruit. Its ok but its very much set as to what you can have etc. StaffStaff mostly speak English well, polite with an efficient check-in process. Overall would stay again, they offer a comfortable bed in a brand new spotless business hotel convenient for Tokyo HND airport. Fast washer and dryer on site and special bed mattress were highlights.","London, England","doc d</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England</strong>",473,4.0
