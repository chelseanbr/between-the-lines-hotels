None of which happened here. 4 nights and house keeping just came once.

We would wait at least 10 minutes for the elevator and if it came within that time frame it would be completely full every time since there were always people waiting for the elevator on every single floor. The AC Unit in our room on the 5th floor would not work and would automatically revert to cooling at 72 degrees after a few minutes of operating at whatever temperature was set. The engineer replaced the fan in our AC unit but was unable to fix the reverting issue and we resorting to sleeping with the window open- in NYC, you can imagine how loud it was.The 2 front desk staff were overwhelmed with the workload that was placed on them (granted, the stay was at what I am sure is a peak time in the tourism season), and the hotel was obviously under staffed.the interactions I had with them were unpleasant, but I completely understand why they would be predisposed to unpleasantness given their working conditions.

They told me to call in the next morning, which I tried to while on the train and they had me on hold for over 10 minutes...we were almost there, so I figured I'd just inquire once we got there.We booked the room on the Hilton app, and it required our payment information so my father in law gave me his card info. NOWHERE on the app, or the confirmation e-mail did it say that we needed to bring the card physically for payment. When we arrived, we were told that we had to have the card physically present, and of course since my father in law didn't come with us, we had to get him to drive 20 miles round trip into his work to print and complete an authorization form with copies of both his card and ID, front and back.The front desk person never got his e-mail reply, so had to call him back and got him to text the photos to me. The attendant said that wouldn't work. I asked her if I could print it on site, she said she couldn't guarantee it would suffice. Tried to connect to WiFi to print, but of course I didn't have a room yet, so I had to go back and ask for the password to print. FINALLY got it printed, she went away for 10 minutes then came back and said it needed to be provided 24 hours before check-in.At this point I am LIVID, so she said she would not charge us for the room that day, but rather the next to satisfy the 24 hour rule. I had to give a physical card for the incidentals though, which posed another issue. What should have been $50 held, on my bank account it showed SIX DoubleTree debits @ $50.00 each...so $300.00!!! Because of this, I was unable to use my debit card during our trip...thank GOD I had cash.Two hours later and almost missing the audition...the only reason why we were there, we got a key to a room. There's 44 floors and only 3 elevators so it took 20 minutes to finally get up to the room.We made it to the audition and coming back I was insistent on not eating at their restaurant (we paid $60 for lunch while waiting for the above to get figured out...one $13 house glass of wine and two appetizers) so we grabbed Chipotle. My own fault for not checking, but they didn't give us silverware, I ordered a burrito bowl. Realized it after waiting the 20+ minutes to get to our room, and I was not going to waste another hour going back down and up to get one.I called room service to see if they'd send a fork, and they said they could but would have to charge us the 10% room fee. Insanity! Called the front desk and they happily obliged. An HOUR later, I finally got my fork.After we showered and tucked in for the night, I received a phone call to my room. It was the front desk letting me know that for some reason, they tried to authorize my father in laws credit card and it declined. I called him, and he was unable to reach his credit card company to see what was going on. He told me to have the hotel call him and he would provide another card. The front desk said that was unacceptable and if another card was used, he would have to go through that whole process again with the authorization form and the copies. How do businesses pay for rooms for their employees?!Thankfully he was able to get in touch with the credit card company, and same as my debit card, the reason why it was declined was because there was a fraud alert since there were 4 debits from DoubleTree at $50, $100, $150 and $200. They did whatever was necessary to make the card be authorized, but WHAT A NIGHTMARE.Still livid, the next day I called Hilton to let them know of my experience and the person on the other line was a total idiot. He kept thinking I was not in my room yet and tried to connect me with the front desk, which of course at this point were the last folks I wanted to speak with. I then e-mailed my concerns and was basically told that was just their fraud policy and sorry about it. So much for their ""Care"" guarantee about doing whatever is necessary to make everything right! Nothing about this hotel visit went right.We didn't get much sleep as the room we had didn't have blackout curtains, just sheer ones and the bright city lights shined right on through. I didn't want to spend $14 on pancakes for my daughter for breakfast so we escaped that awful place and experience the second we woke up, and will NEVER go back again.",,rmcd1983,3,1.0

I came last year and really enjoyed the location and staff. So when I booked a returning trip to New York, I fondly remembered this hotel and promptly booked two of my four nights here. We arrived at 7am after a redeye and had very little hope that we could check-in early. Obviously, they pretty much laughed at us and told us to come back at 4 for check-in. They did offer to text if our rooms were available sooner. I thought that was a really great gesture and excellent customer service. We return to the hotel at 330p because we had reservations we had to leave for by 4pm and were hoping to check in and change. We get to the front desk and were told that yes our rooms were ready an hour ago. We never received any texts or calls like we were promised. When I asked why, they apologized and said they must have forgot. Well gee thanks...After my last stay where I was on the 39th floor, I was grateful I was on the 9th this time. As I recalled, the elevators are really slow and I knew I wouldn't mind taking the stairs if I was on a lower floor. The room was nice but a little cramped, which is to be expected in New York. Honestly, this was a mediocre stay. Nothing bad and nothing great. I love the area and was able to get some great runs in because of where we were located. And the subway was easy to access. I was mostly happy after the rough check in up until the check out. We are waiting for the elevator at 10:50am so we can check out at the 11am check out time and move to our next hotel. There are three elevators but for some reason there is only one opening on our floor. And every time it opened it was jam packed full of people and luggage. We were patient because we knew everyone was checking out at this time. By 11:10am I am no longer patient while waiting for an elevator. My friend took the stairs since he only had a duffle bag and went to check us out of our rooms so we wouldn't be fined for a late check out. At 11:20am my other friend was sick of waiting and took his suitcase and pushed it down the stairs. I tried to wait it out and get an elevator because I had a large suitcase, duffle bag, umbrella and purse. At 11:30am I was fuming. I had wasted 40 minutes of my day waiting for a friggin elevator and could no longer sit in the hallway reading my book. I then started the trek down the 9 flights of stairs with all my luggage just as everyone else had. It took me forever as I had to keep moving out of the way of multiple other people doing the same thing. When I finally made it to the bottom, I was angry, covered in sweat and carrying a now broken umbrella because it got stuck in the stairwell. Not one employee apologized or offered to help. Just one comment when I finally made it to the bottom of ""rough day huh?"" I am still baffled by this experience. I made an exception the first time with the elevators but I now understand the old saying ""fool me once, shame on you.

Make sure your confirmation spells out every little detail of what you paid for because otherwise they will not honor it. I stayed in this hotel the end of September 2019. It was a last minute trip and was because I wanted to go to an event on Governor’s Island. I noticed that the Hilton Hotels offered a “Stay Longer Sunday” on one of the Hilton websites it explained this meant you could stay until 6pm on Sunday. I selected a Hilton Hotel that offered this. I drove to NYC on a Friday evening. I arrived to the promised valet parking and found nobody around. Finally a man appeared downstairs and rudely told me I’d have to wait for the valets. He disappeared, finally a more mannerly individual appeared to help me, and the valets finally arrived. The room itself was ok. The bathroom is very badly designed – no shelves to put anything on so you end up having to pile everything on your suitcase outside the bathroom, the shower has a weather strip to stop the water getting out but it stops about 2 inches from the bottom of the shower so the floor was very wet. There is no bath and the shower is tiny. In the bedroom there was a drip from the AC unit – it was dripping onto the floor. All of that aside it wasn’t terrible – we got room service and the waiters were polite and the food was pretty good. The reason I wanted the stay longer Sunday was because I wanted to shower after the event on Sunday, before driving home – so on Sunday morning we went to our event and came back around noon, ate and showered. As I was showering the cleaning staff knocked on the door. My daughter answered and told them we had bought the stay longer package. I finished my shower, my daughter was showering when the downstairs staff called me – I told them I had bought the stay longer package – they told me they’d need to see that – and they’d need to see where it said until 6pm. Of course the confirmation only said “Stay Longer Sunday” (I paid more for this option) but didn’t say what time, so when I went down to show the confirmation the front desk woman she told me this didn’t prove that it was until 6pm and normally they’d charge someone an extra night for not leaving on time. At this point I needed to get back upstairs so I told her I needed to pack and this had caused myself and my daughter a terrible amount of stress. She didn’t miss a beat, was entirely unconcerned about what this did to us, the customer, she then questioned me for leaving my daughter in the room (my daughter is 12) unpleasant words followed and I returned upstairs to finish packing. Not a hint of an apology, embarrassment, No customer service concern – nothing! It was basically “Prove it” which, due to the confirmation that only stated “extended Stay Sunday” I was out of luck. Another supervisor / manager type called me shortly after I got back upstairs, she basically restated what they had already said – they had no intention of honoring what I purchased my receipt only said “Stay longer Sunday” but didn’t say until what time therefore I should have been out of there by 11am. I actually had no intention of staying until 6pm – I had a long drive back – but I was hunted out of the room. I am a middle aged, professional woman. I am quite sure I have never been hunted from anywhere before – it was a really awful experience. Not only did I not get any form of an apology – they stuck to their guns and let me know I could have been charged for the extra time. A few days after I got back I started a chat with their customer service – and was expecting based on this chat – that they would contact me and apologize. Nope! Not one hint of that. They had multiple opportunities to make this right and opted instead to not do that. I understand that it’s tough to get staff right now – but Hilton really needs to do better than that.","Abington, Massachusetts","Exploration254393</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Abington, Massachusetts</strong>",0,1.0

The rooms are so small and you don't even have anywhere to put your toiletries in the bathroom. The AC unit was a nightmare. It was so noisy and antiquated that it barely cooled the room and I had to use ear plugs in order to sleep. The elevators are a nightmare....only 3 serving 44 floors! The layout of the hotel is also a nightmare. Reception is on floor 2 and it's a bun fight every day trying to get from the ground to the 2nd and elsewhere within the hotel. No amenities as such. Breakfast is hosted in the adjacent restaurant. Worst Hilton breakfast ever. Not only was the choices on offer extremely limited, but the scrambled eggs where so dried up they resembled yellow cow pats. The serving dish didn't close properly, which added to the problem of the eggs drying out. The chef certainly knew about it as he kept trying to push the lid down to close it. Interestingly enough they are awaiting a food hygiene standard rating....personally I know what I would award them! The tables weren't properly set with cutlery and teaspoons had to be requested. The melon wasn't ripe, the things that looked like a scone could be used as paving bricks. It all seriously yuk, apart from the bananas which had not been tampered with. On a positive note, the coffee was quite good. All in all it is a fairly rubbish hotel located in a good area. Best it's demolished and rebuilt.

I also found the staff friendly and was pleased with the housekeeping service. However, the main room was tiny, with only a narrow passageway around the perimeter of the bed. And the bathroom was small as well, with no counter space to speak of - and I travel light. All of this could have been OK - it's NYC after all, there's no need to spend a lot of time in a hotel room. But I'm a very tall guy, so when I book a Cityview King Room - and the view of WTC was great from the 40th floor - I think it's reasonable to expect a Standard King mattress, not what I have determined to have been what is referred to as an ""RV Short King"" mattress. My 79"" height belongs on a standard Queen or King mattress, with 80"" in length, not the 75"" RV short king. And I checked the Hilton website to be sure and, no, this non-standard mattress is not disclosed in the description of the King room. It says there's a 32"" TV, but can't be bothered to be honest about the short bed. Although the mattress and pillows were comfortable, I woke up with sore feet that didn't get proper rest from walking the streets of Manhattan because they were hanging off the end. The fundamental purpose of this hotel room - rest - was defeated by this. Don't lie to people about the mattresses in your hotel rooms.Almost as frustrating is what it took to get out of the hotel every morning. The other reviews on this site - and I read them thinking, ""It can't be that bad,"" - are not exaggerating about the amount of time it takes to get an elevator down, especially in the busy morning hours. There are only three elevators - and small ones at that - to service a 44-floor hotel with nine rooms on each floor. Many people end up getting on an up elevator and then taking it down as that's the only way to get out of the hotel in the morning, so no matter what floor you're on, you're taking a risk at getting down to the lobby. If someone is already on the elevator with luggage because they're checking out, not only does that mean there likely isn't room for you on the elevator, but even if you can squeeze on, it's going to definitely stop on the 2nd floor - where the reception area is - rather than going straight to the ground floor. Why is that extra annoying? Because if you squeezed on a full elevator on floor 40, it's still going to stop at almost every 2 to 3 floors for other people who are calling the elevator, and you're going to have to be rude and press ""door closed"" to try to make it move any faster at all. Again, this sounds like an exaggeration, but it's truly a nightmare. Especially in the heat and humidity of August - the A/C is minimal, if at all, in the elevator.A friend of mine in NYC says, ""You get what you pay for in New York"" and this hotel proves that adage very true. It was one of the cheapest hotels to book in the area through Hilton's website, and now I know why. I prepaid for the room to save even a few more bucks, but while my credit card was charged for the prepaid room at the time I booked, and I agreed for a $50/night deposit to be put on my card as a pending charge to cover incidentals - standard hotel business - what I didn't agree to was to have my card have a pending charge for the price of the room THAT I'D ALREADY PAID FOR. When I spoke with someone at reception about this, they acknowledged it was an error that shouldn't have happened, but that there was no way it could clear until I checked out after five nights. I didn't take a trip to NYC expecting not to spend money, but to have that much money tied up on one of my credit cards for my entire stay was ridiculous and rude.I have stayed at Hilton properties all over the country and while no hotel is perfect, I have generally been able to rely on consistency throughout the Hilton brands.

My complaints are about environmental issues. The first thing the desk staff does when you check in is hand you two plastic bottles of water! Plastic water bottles are quickly destroying the environment, AND NYC has delicious tap water, so there is absolutely no reason why this hotel should be handing out water bottles. There are cups in every room that could be used with the tap. Also, every morning after I showered, I hung up my towels, since the little card said that they wouldn't be replaced if they were hung up. Yet, every day, I came back to my room to find that the used towels were taken and new, clean towels were left in their place. After two days, I just left the Do Not Disturb sign on my door and refused the housekeeping. What a waste of water to wash all those towels after only one use, and what a shame to make your guests think you care about the environment, when you actually don't. I strongly encourage the management to reconsider its policy of handing out plastic water bottles to all guests, and to start implementing the laundry policy that is actually advertised.","New York City, New York","Amy A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",18,3.0

There are issues which other people have mentioned such as everything being a little cramped (which is understandable in NYC), the lack of a fridge in the rooms and the limited number of elevators leading to long waits. However, the main problem for our stay was noise from outside. We had been up since 3am travelling and really needed an early night's sleep but an open air restaurant/dance bar opposite the hotel started playing music really loudly from 5pm until past midnight. Obviously you expect a bit more noise being in NYC but this was ridiculously loud. We complained to the front desk, unfortunately we couldn't be moved to a higher room (we were on floor 16 of 44), but they did provide us with ear plugs and said that they would send over someone to ask the bar to turn the music down. Unfortunately this didn't seem to have much effect and we finally fell asleep in the early hours of the morning. We were then awoken from our unplanned but very necessary lie-in early by people using the elevators which were just outside our door. At this point we decided we couldn't face another sleep deprived night and checked out a day early.

I rang multiple times to check room accommodations, even the night before my stay. I paid in advance with the school credit card and completed the tax exempt form. While on the phone I wanted to make sure one of the rooms could accommodate 3 teenage boys. I was told only king size rooms were available. So to solve the problem I asked for a roll away bed. I was told over the phone- no problem. On arrival, I felt like my reservation was an inconvenience. It took a while to find my reservation and when I asked about the rollaway I was told that due to storage restrictions they do not have any at the hotel. The hotel was full and therefore they didn’t have any other rooms to accommodate the three boys. I asked to talk to a manager. I waited 20 minutes and then asked the manager to call me. She did call and I was told that a room maybe available late tonight if a cancellation comes in. We lucked out. A room did become available, for one night only. Now I had 5 rooms on five different floors. Yippee! Fun at curfew! After the first night we checked out of the room we were given. Later in the afternoon I talked to another person at reception about our situation and asked what was the plan for night two. He asked me to explain what had happened because there was nothing in the computer on our reservation. I explained and was told the same thing that I was told the previous night. Totally full hotel. No rooms available and no rollaways. This time I felt my situation was falling on deaf ears and when I asked for a managers name who was on call that night, no name was given until I asked which business card should I contact. I asked if I could have more comforters and pillows sent to my boys rooms so they could sleep on the floor for one night only. The receptionists said they will send some bedding up. I gave the room number and they questioned it. I told them to look at my reservation to confirm the room it’s needed for. I am so upset that a 17 year old kid that paid to go on their first trip to NYC has to sleep on the floor because of a lack of communication and blatant bad customer service from a hotel chain that we as a family are gold loyalty members of.

As mentioned by others, it takes a LONG time for the hot water to arrive, both at night and in the morning. Our concern was with check-in. We arrived late (after 8:00 p.m.) and there were two women working at the desk (Mar. 30th). Neither greeted us, and both wanted to hand us off to the other (one of them was obviously trying to leave at the end of her shift). There was no welcoming manner to either of them, no offer of the hospitality bag with complementary water, and I had to ask for the ""warm cookies."" Others in our group who arrived at various times throughout the afternoon/evening received no cookies and no water, and didn't know to ask. When leaving the next morning I asked for the welcome bag, and they were happy to accomodate. This staff couldn't have been nicer or more professional. When, minutes later, a HUGE busload of touritsts arrived en masse, I didn't know who to feel worse for, the TOURISTS or the single check-in person!?!

They are however very clean and comfortable with great bedding and bathroom facilities. The hotel is in a great location with so much to do around the area and close to the subway.We unfortunately had some very negative concerns. 1) Check in:We arrived early and understood that we wouldn't be able to check in until the correct time, but we thought we could at least ask. We were greeted by a very terse check-in attendant named Venetta who was extremely rude to us. Practically yelling to us ""That check in is not until 2pm."" We kindly asked if there was a possibility to see if she could check to see if any rooms were ready. Again we were yelled at by her ""Can't you see that Im very stressed out here! You need to wait and see when the manager arrives!"" We asked if she could give us an indication as to when the manager might arrive. ""I don't know!"" She yelled, ""Maybe in an hour - maybe in two hours?"" We sadly backed away and took our bags to the bell desk to be looked after while we went and found some breakfast. After this, we went back to see if this manager had turned up. He was there and we asked if we could check in early and he made everything look so easy. He found us all rooms that were available and checked us in early. 2) Check out:We had other issues with the hot water, and this occurred at our final morning of checkout.We needed to check out at 5:00 for a 14 hour flight. Each of us set our alarms at 4:00 so we could shower and prepare to leave.My room had NO HOT WATER - it was freezingMy two other friends' rooms had ONLY HOT / BOILING WATER.None of us were able to take a shower before we departed to the airport.I was the first to the check out desk and made a small complaint. The check out attendant apologised and offered to add 1000 points on my Hilton Honour account. 2 weeks later and this hasn't happened.My friend checked out and made a small complaint and the checkout attendant apologised and offered to contact expedia (who we booked with) and provide a small refund as compensation. The same occurred with our friend in the third room.None of this has happened and I feel sad that we were lied to by the desk staff.So overall, a great hotel but we had a horrible start and finish to the experience.

The more questions that were asked, the more visibly frustrated the attendant got. These were my first impressions...I got our room assignment, found our way up, and walked in only to find that the confirmed and paid for double room that we had booked was a single. So I called the front desk and explained that I thought a mistake had been made. The response i got was that all the double had been booked, and there was nothing that could be done. I questioned the fact that I had a booking that was confirmed, and was told ""I'm not sure what to tell you"" and was offered an opportunity to come down to talk about it further, but there was nothing that could be done. Puzzled, I thought to myself then what was the point??I gave the stay a 2 rating because of the location. It was convenient to have the subway stations near by.

This was a vacation trip for me and my wife. It was my first time ever coming to New York and seeing where my wife was born. So, with me being a Hilton rewards member I wanted to stay in the nicest location to which I believed Manhattan financial district to be an affluent safe area. However, our stay didn’t reflect what I thought one bit. After a few nights, we noticed our first room had an ant infestation in which I have video of. So, they moved us to a different room, but the door wouldn’t close shut on its own. I had to manually force it to close shut. Also, the shower was leaking water out on the floor and soaked the entire floor towel we had down and I almost slipped getting out the shower as well. Lastly, one of the main reasons my wife loves Double Tree is for the amazing soft warm chocolate chip cookies. But for some reason at this hotel the cookies were rock hard and we try getting new ones daily (3x) but yet the same results just over cooked and hard. Hopefully, something can be done about this major inconvenience because I didn’t feel as if I got the value for my money and this experience with Double Tree didn’t give me a great first impression on New York.I even extended my stay in New York one more day and stayed at a different hotel Holiday INN Downtown Brooklyn and that stay was 100x better.","San Diego, California","shaunmaye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",1,1.0

I notice my check out date is the next day- she tells me somehow they split my reservation and I’d need to call - so I go upstairs I’m on hold for 40 minutes to ve told that my reservation Is fine and that there should be no issues. So I call down to the front desk and the woman informs me all is well and that I would need to do nothing else . The next day after working and being out most of the day we go back to the room only to find that the key does not work. I go back down to the front desk- let me note there are only 3 elevators for a building with over 40 Floors. We get there again we are waiting for an additional 16-20 minutes so they can figure it out and find out if my personal possessions are still there or had been moved ?? So then after all of that I am told I can go back to the same room my stuff wasn’t moved I just need to CHECK IN AGAIN.

The location is perfect in that it is footsteps from a subway station and walking distance from any building in the financial district. Check in was quick and the staff (Luis) was able to make a room change for us quickly and without any hassle. The rooms are small but this has to be expected for a downtown location in any city; however they were clean, contemporary and well furnished. There was some maintenance issues that were never fully resolved, the sink faucet has to be run while the shower is on to keep the water hot, the bathroom fan ran constantly and the solution was to disconnect it and there was a deep crack in the shower floor which could cause cuts if you were not careful and for that I took off half a star. The breakfast was a let down. While the staff were pleasant and attentive, Fernando was particularly good at this job, under cooked eggs to order were more a health hazard than a morning welcome and overcooked hot buffet food made the place feel like a cheap motel. even with free coupons for the week, my wife and I chose other local options such as the starbucks round the corner or one of the fantastic breakfast foot carts within eyesight of the front door. Again for this I took off l half star.A final note is to give praise to the door staff all of which were friendly and always had time for a quick chat. Hopton was especially helpful with his morning greetings and informed us of (and arranged for) the airport shuttle which we did not know about and this saved us time and stress.Doubletree is not a hotel that should be passed up and with a few minor updates and changes it could easily compete with other more expensive locations.",Toronto,"Jeffrey D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",12,4.0

After a long and rainy day in the city , back to the hotel, the C/I process was unfriendly: no info about the property, no questions about the reason of the visit in NY ( even it was a special event for me which that's why I was sending the email !). And what was very important for me: no question about the method of payment !! They charge the cc on file in advance and with an impolite attitude the Front Desk agent told me that she can do nothing about that!In the room when we try to use the shower there was no hot water !! We call to the Reception and the lady told me that we must wait 10 min because the room is on the 43rd floor! We called again to ask how we can stop the heater because in the room was 75 F , but nobody answer on the phone and we figure it out ourselves hot to stop it from a button under the heater.Also, we wait 4o minutes for a toothbrush kit!The only positive thing was the view on the 43rd floor .All of this after I booked this reservation thru my Hilton member account.Next time pay attention when you put a big worldwide brand on a hotel in NY.",Pennsylvania,"silviuioneld</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>",3,2.0

We did not expect our room to be ready by the time we arrived and left our luggage with the best front door person ever Allen. He should be called Director Of First Contact as he is really a great ambassador for the hotel.When we arrived back at the hotel at the agreed time the room would be ready, it was not. It only had . to be checked on cleanliness and such. The lady at the reception would come to us one that was done. It should not take more than 10-15 minutes according to her. Only the lady did not come to us. Even worse, she ended her shift and left without informing us at all. By this time we already waited for more than 30 minutes.By the minute my wife got more annoyed and I was not a happy person. After almost an hour I went up to the front desk. Nobody acted as if they were up to date with our situation. This despite the two gents behind the counter being there when we walked up almost an hour prior.This infuriated me and the front desk manager was called for. I explained to her the situation and she was apologetic and very unhappy with this treatment. She rectified it by upgrading us and providing us with breakfast and a dinner voucher.The room was nice; a bit dated though and soem things were loose or not properly fixed. We were already happy that we finally had a room.The next day we used our voucher in the Italian restaurant at the ground floor of the hotel. After dinner we paid with the voucher and left a cash tip. The latter despite very bad service from the waiter who had more eye for four girls sitting at a table near us. He was trying to impress them and we could overhear him fibbing. (you do not leave the great country of Albania to become a waiter in New York when you have this great life and make so much money in Albania).When we left the restaurant and were waiting for the elevator this same waiter came up and demanded more tip. When I told that I had given him enough for the great service not rendered he threatened us that he would take the full amount on the hold by the hotel and more. You can tell me anything. I am big boy, been in war situations so a guy like him does not make me feel uncomfortable. My wife though is another story. She is all for kindness, harmony and more. She felt so uncomfortable that she started hiding stuff in the room in case he really would access the room and take stuff. Also she did not want to go for breakfast anymore since that is in the same restaurant and she wanted to avoid a confrontation in case he would be working the breakfast shift too.We sent an email to hotel manager. He called us back as we requested. He implied he was not happy with the situation and would come back to us. The manager never came back. We went for breakfast elsewhere.Overall the hotel is reasonable. It is more three stars at most (service rendered by Allen are five stars).We probably would not go back. And do not count on the hotel manager as he will not follow through his promises.When you decide to stay in the hotel avoid the overpriced Italian place. Go next door to the Irish pub. They serve better food at more realistic prices. In the weekend Barry is on staff and he is a blast.

Arrived right on time -- no last minute check-in where rooms might have been limited. No river view. View of the cooling towers of a nearby building, plus the rest of the skyline.

A person of size would have a very difficult time fitting into that shower.Halls on guest room floors are so narrow that two adults cannot pass without turning sideways!Staff team leader William did, per policy, check with guests about their satisfaction, so I met with him in the lobby. He admitted that some rooms are very small. (Why would you put a Gold Member who booked six months in advance into one of those rooms?)He did follow up on the river view issue. His explanation was that, when you use the HILTON App to check in, it apparently overrides the booking instructions you made and just assigns you a room. I did not choose a room with the system -- just let the App assign the room. (Again, why would the hotel's App assign a Gold Member to one of the smallest rooms in the hotel?)Lesson: DO NOT use the App to check in!So, overall, I always hesitate to give a low rating to a property, and truth be told, the room and facility were clean and modern.

Meanwhile the staff were unable to provide us with any information on what was going on.Add to that: a horrible smell in the room, a ringing sound in the ceiling due to water pressure issues, holes in the sheets and no coffee refills by housekeeping.

The Doubletree Financial District offered really reasonable rates for Labor Day weekend, but I'm afraid I learned why after my first evening there.Having taken a redeye flight from the West Coast, I arrived at the hotel at about 8 AM on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. I knew there would be little chance of having a room available to check into so was prepared to check bags with the valet and come back to the hotel in the evening to officially check in. The front desk very generously offered me a voucher for free breakfast buffet in their downstairs restaurant since no rooms were available. They did not have to do this -- was a very nice thing to offer.I returned to the hotel at around 8:30 PM, ready to finally get into my room. There was a line of guests stretching from the elevators to the front door of the hotel. The hotel has an odd layout where the front desk and lobby are on the 2nd floor. But what was causing this huge backup was the fact that one of the three elevators was out of service! For a 44-story property, three elevators isn't sufficient so when one goes down, the entire hotel basically grinds to a halt. There was no valet downstairs so I could not pick up my bags. I walked up the stairs to the lobby to pick up keys. The front desk told me that the valet would eventually bring up my bags, but to be please be patient due to the situation with the elevators.About an hour later, the valet arrived with my luggage. I was actually pleasantly surprised it was only an hour as I was expecting worse. Luckily, I wasn't going anywhere else that night so I didn't have to deal with the elevator situation again. I went to sleep assuming that it would be taken care of by tomorrow. Unfortunately, the third elevator never went back into service so my entire weekend was spent with 15 - 20 minute waits for every elevator trip. When your room is on the 28th floor, taking the stairs isn't really an option. Needless to say, it's extremely inconvenient to add an extra 20 minutes into each trip on the elevator.To the hotel's credit, when I wrote to complain about how the elevator problem really made the weekend more difficult, they offered a sincere apology and Hilton Honors points. It's a tough situation for everyone, but the hotel really needs some work on it to have it meet Doubletree standards.","Chicago, Illinois","Catherine T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",18,3.0

So, we ended up talking impolitely to make them sit up because they seemed to really dislike being talked back to and I did not understand why they are okay doing that themselves to customers; why be in hospitality industry if you can't be polite? We also moved rooms as the AC was not working and they had given us a lower floor before. Apart from the usual excuses of that this is not so and so's job and not doing anything worthy of reasonable service, they made us wait five hours to give us the key and didn't bother to check if the room was ready even though we did it ourselves and saw the room was ready.

Again, they lost one of the items while moving and, as expected took two days and multiple managers and multiple reminders to get it done... all while it was with housekeeping.

When we arrived at the hotel, I expected that blankets and pillows would be in the room given that we had 2 adults and 2 kids on the reservation. Using the Hilton app, I requested that these be delivered while we were out at the theater and I received an acknowledgment from Vanetta that this would be done. I saved a screenshot of her confirmation. We returned after 11 to find that they were not delivered and the message had been deleted! It took almost an hour (with very tired kids) to get what we needed. On top of this, the couch was dirty, stained, and worn.Our AC was also leaking into the carpet giving a moldy smell to the room. When we spoke to the front desk the next day we were told there were no other rooms available but they would see what they could do. I was promised an email from Peter the GM, but ended up speaking to Enoch who offered to move us to 2 adjoining rooms instead.One of the new rooms still had the AC leaking into the carpet, but it was less moldy smelling!I had good experiences with Enoch and the bell staff, but problems were largely dismissed by other staff. I was told repeatedly that no one else had complained and that all they could do was ask for housekeeping, maintenance, etc. to act but that they could not do anything else to make sure it happened. As a Hilton Gold member I expect more and so should Hilton.

The rooms were fine and cleaned daily.

Also the hotel were extremely accommodating, even though the booking agency had got one of our rooms wrong and there was nothing they could do about it- my advice book with the hotel direct!!

Only missed a fridge, hence the 3 stars instead of 4 star hotel, as used to fridge in the 4 and 5 star hotels I say in, but air conditioning will keep room cool enough for most mediations, unless it has to be kept in fridge like insulin.

The rooms and corridors are narrow and never saw a reception in the second floor of a hotel. There is no place for you to park during check-in (ok, that’s NYC, folk) but you literally enter the hotel from its back. I left my wife and kids in the car, got an elevator to reach reception, and went to ask information, but I was checked-in in couple of seconds, got my rooms keys, and quickly took my stuff to my room. That looks good, except for the fact that the receptionist didn’t ask any questions about who’s entering the room with me, and that seems a very serious issue concerning the security of the hotel. It looked like you can bring in whoever you want. Next morning, went to a small restaurant where we’re supposed to have breakfast and I was asked for vouchers. “Which voucher?!” “The receptionist should have given you”. Leave your family and your good humor, go up one floor, ask for breakfast vouchers. By the way, the poorest breakfast in America. Hilton is no longer synonym of luxury hotels anymore. Oh, but there’s parking at the hotel, one block down the street.

When we got there, we had to explain to the check-in staff multiple times that we were there for two nights, not one. I've done the same before at other hilton properties, but this was the first time it was an issue. Additionally, while we were waiting in line to check in, someone else came up and was trying to get our info, related to ""Hilton Grand Vacations"". I don't pay to visit a hotel and get sold a timeshare while waiting in line. Our second day, we got back to our room and our keys didn't work. The woman at the desk said because we had two bookings, we had to go down and have the keys reactivated. She acted like this was our fault - and that we should have known all this. No other time I've used a reward certificate in combo with a booking has this been a problem.The room was fine, other then the shower leaked water all over the floor. The hotel is 44 stories, and has 3 elevators. We had long waits for elevators, and lots of stops up and down. I would suggest a floor low enough you can take the stairs if you don't want to spend 10 minutes trying to get to your room and back. The breakfast included as a gold member is the worst I've ever had at a hilton hotel. It's in a tiny room with only 5 tables. The hot food was OK. The first day there were no drinks - no coffee, juice, water, milk. The second day the waiter brought us some water, after we asked (saw other guests do the same).

But the nightmare of being all the way on the 44th floor has its problems. I stayed for 10 days, and not once was I able to get either down or up on the elevator in under 20 minutes, This was the average wait time just to board it, The entire staff uses the same elevators including all the housekeepers and workers. Not once do they offer to wait, They just push them selves into it. But here's the real problem, On 7/14/2018 in the morning while in the elevator heading down with 8 yes 8 other people it stops around the seventh floor. It was stuck for over 30 minutes, with zero ventilation or air able to get into then elevator. The alarm in the elevator and the fire department also located in the elevator didn't work. Luckily we had phone service, One of the phone's called the front desk, Who was of zero help, She told us that this is the first time that this happened (Which is actually a lie, As the Bellhop the following day said it gets stuck all the time) She mentioned that it would be less than 5 minutes before it was running again, So after 25 more minutes we told her to call the fire department, As even oxygen was getting scarce, and panic had set in we asked the front desk to call the fire department in which she actually refused to do. So we called on an additional cell phone on our own, Just as the Firetruck was getting dispatched the elevator moved, We all got off the very next floor and walked down the stairs. I had such a horrible experience that I checked out a day earlier than I was supposed too and stayed in a different hotel. Zero compensation or even an apology were never extended my way.I dont want to even get started on how terrible the Breakfast Buffet was.I will never stay in this hotel again.","Portland, Oregon","milliganfm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",4,1.0

The subway is quite close and within walking distance. Lets start with the good things: Lobby – very nicely done it looks very professional and clean. It’s a good welcome to the hotel itself. The staff were very friendly and professional. Okay here goes the bad things. Bearing in mind that I have spent time in many Hilton hotels over the years and have been a diamond member. These have been at varying levels of cost and quality. Room – Standard size, same amenities that you would get any Hilton. Coffee machine which is fine, the linen was old and did have a whole in there. The iron needs replacing and ironing board also. The air conditioning is loud and I believe was damp on the carpet underneath. There is one sofa seat as well. There was no bath but shower which had decent pressure. The sink was too big and there was no place to put my shower gels, etc. Food – When I checked into the hotel bearing in mind it was my first time in new York I was actually quite excited about the breakfast and food in the hotel. I checked the menu in my room and was really disappointed to see it was standard menu that you would find in the uk. To add the menu was in such a tatty state, it was falling apart. In the morning I went to check on the breakfast. The food is served in a partner restaurant at the bottom of the hotel, I have not been more disappointed in hotel food in my life. There was a very limited selection of food, for the hot food, there was scrambled eggs, cardboard bacon, bad sausages and pancakes. There was no fresh rolls or croissants, the fruit seemed to be canned. I should have known that there was something wrong after there was no one in the restaurant for breakfast in the morning. Lifts- There are only 3 lifts in the building and they are constantly in use by the guests and the staff. The staff (not the receptionists or public facing staff) use the lifts themselves even if there is only one level for them to go. They could easily walk this but I don’t know why they don’t. They are constantly busy and at peak times you can wait for 20 minutes for the lifts. Overall a good location but that’s about it, unfortunately I have been told that hotels in New York are expensive but I expected more from a hotel that costs over 200 dollars per a night. I would not stay here again and cannot recommend it to anyone.","London, United Kingdom","Gary O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",28,3.0

I guess this is what you get for just under $200 a night in the Financial District. I guess I am used o Q-tips, nicer soaps, a fridge. The rooms was pretty clean, not spotless.... and smelled fine too. Bed was very comfy. But whatever. I specifically requested a room with a tub... and they gave me a shower room... I switched it out with little resistance from front desk. Then, when I took a bath, (my solution to a cross country flight) I was interrupted by knocking at the door and a man's voice. I ignored, they continued, I got out and told them to go away, I hadn't ordered anything. I was a little frightened. I returned to the bath, anther knock, and a few more. Again I told them to leave. They said it was security. Now, I would think someone would call first, before sending two different men to a room with a single female occupant. No way am I answering that door, especially still dripping from a bath. I called the front desk and they said the room below me had a leaking ceiling and they had to check the room. They said they had called first... but I heard nothing. The phones are weird so who knows. They offered to send a woman from front desk up with the man but said they did need to check the tub. I decided instead to vacate the room. They called me shortly to say it was ok and fine to return.

Pros: 1) Room was relatively clean 2) Bed was comfortable.3) Breakfast at the restaurant next door is good (and included in some reservations).Cons: 1) Elevators are SO SLOW... and the lobby isn't on ground floor... so every time you need something, you wait for the elevator and then get off on level 2. then wait AGAIN for ANOTHER elevator to go to your room. I timed it last night. It took 7 minutes to get from the ground floor to my room because I needed to stop at the front desk to pick something up. Absurd2) Rooms are TINY... you can barely walk around in them and 2 people cannot pass each other in the room. Even by NY standards - it is SO SMALL3) Noise - we had to move rooms because the screeching from the broken plumbing in other rooms was so awful we were up all night. They told me they didn't know what we were talking about - but then 2 other guests in the elevator said they had also been complaining. The old plumbing needs repair.4) Poor staff service. Other than the manager (who I corresponded with on text... not in person); the staff were not helpful or accommodating. And to be honest, the manager could have done more to help with the absurd noise our area of rooms was dealing with. One of them actually SCOLDED me for losing my breakfast ticket/voucher.

We chose the hotel mainly because I know the Doubletree brand and also the location in Lower Manhattan is good. The location is definitely the high point - right by Battery Park, the hotel is ideally situated to explore Liberty, Ellis and Staten islands and the financial district. We spent an entire day doing this. There is also a subway station at the end of the street for exploring the rest of the city. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and courteous throughout our stay. We had a view of the Freedom Tower from our window which my son loved. But the hotel itself is a little disappointing. The decor in the rooms is very tired and in need of a refresh. The air-conditioning unit is effective but incredibly loud which makes it difficult to sleep at night. So you have a choice of the 35 degree NYC humidity or being kept awake by the rattly AC. The lobby is on the first floor (American second floor) so the welcome on the ground floor is underwhelming. There are only two lifts so the wait is sometimes really long - 10 minutes plus, which when you're on the 32nd floor is tough. The restaurant is not actually part of the hotel but a separate restaurant next door with an interconnecting door. Don't waste your time having breakfast here - there are tons of much better places to have breakfast a short walk away. Pearl Diner, on Pearl Street, would be my top recommendation as it's an original American diner where nothing has changed since the 1950s. Overall the hotel wasn't worth what I paid for it.

On arrival which was late around 2am they were 2 staff at the front desk checking in no line just myself and one other couple came up to the 2nd floor where the lobby is located. I had the less competent of the two as she could not seem to get me situated. The couple was dealt with by the other lady within 5 mins and about 3 more people came and left after that and I was still waiting. Eventually I was told the room I booked(King Room city view) was not available so I was placed in a room with 2 double beds for the night and given complementary water(2 small bottles) and breakfast. The next morning I had breakfast. It was nothing spectacular and not a very wide selection. The basics fruit,toast, bagels, pancakes, pastries bacon and tater tots and a few other things. Got to check out of my room the next day and into the room I booked around midday. The room had a slightly smoky scent when I entered. Also the heaters in the bathroom took a lot longer to kick in. Like 10 mins for the shower to heat up. The other problem I had was with the temp control. I tried to turn the ac down a bit since the room was getting too chilly and then it just went kaput and started blowing hot air. After like 5 mins of trying to figure out on my own or waiting to see if it would readjust on its own I got frustrated and called to have maintenance come check it out. They came about 15 mins later by that time it was just overbearing. And that was on the same day I was getting ready to check out and trying to get all my stuff together didn't improve my mood. Checking out was a lot smoother however I checked my online banking to see I had been charged more pending than was on my booking so I made an inquiry and sure enough they had the wrong rate by an extra 20 a night which is an extra 40 a night in my currency which is A LOT. I'm not sure it would have been changed if I didnt draw it to their attention. The best staff were the guys at the entrance. A special mention to Allen who was super helpful with my luggage. Overall for the prices in NYC I need the service to match and I was let down by the service at Doubletree.

At one time.. out of the three elevators only one was working. There was a line for the elevator out the ground floor all the way up the block. Not sure why the hotel has not addressed this issue.

Just standing there to check in multiple people were angry with the front desk service. Ok. Now on to the room.Our first room was on the 37th floor. We had to change rooms due to the air conditioner leaking water all over the floor. Sopping wet all around the bed. The carpet was had mold. So this had been going on for awhile. The air conditioner grill was broken and only half of the unit was blowing air. The air blowing out the vent... too smelled like mold. So after going down and talking to the front desk girl, she was rude and said they didn't have any rooms available. My wife started to get irritated. She finally got us a new room but it wasn't ready yet. So we left and came back later to another front desk clerk. This one was very nice. She told us that she was putting us on the top floor. I guess these were newer remodeled rooms. This is were we stayed the rest of our stay. Not to say that there weren't issues but we dealt with them. Hair left in the shower after the maid cleaned. Also she did not restock anything. Shampoo. Ect...The phone didnt work. The TV was acting funny. also the long wait on the elevator... Like I said we just dealt with it. I wish Management would deal with these issues. The hotel is in a great area. It just needs some attention ASAP. On a brighter side. The door men were the best. They helped us with everything we needed. With a smile. If it wasnt for them I would have rated the hotel less than average.

The front desk for check in is located on the second floor. Also, the hotel restaurant, which is a local restaurant as well, is located and accessed via the street level entrance. The breakfast menu, selections and service was not up to par for what I expect from a Hilton property. Also, the rooms, furniture and amenities need an upgrade at this property, besides addressing the elevators and restaurant issues. If it was not the interaction with the friendly hotel staff and managers, this property could easily slip into a ""two"" rating with the negatives that need work, but it also has the potential to be a ""four"" rated property as well, if the owners / management start to work on the deficiencies we encountered.","Orlando, Florida","X2116PDthomasw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",4,3.0

Price wise it is the same as the hotel that we normally stay at in midtown but doesn’t compare AT ALL. I had hoped that with the name Hilton that this would be somewhat of a guarantee for quality but for me, that quality is somewhat lacking. The room itself is small, even for NY standards. The air conditioning unit made more noise than the traffic in midtown and that’s saying something. After arriving yesterday, severely jet lagged, and before going out for some things, I asked for a small fridge for our room. No problem was the answer - there would be a fee - also not a problem. I bought some things that have to be cooled only to arrive back to hear that there wasn’t a fridge available but I could keep some things in their fridge on the 2nd floor. The problem with so many floors/rooms and the elevators had been well documented so you can understand that I wasn’t happy having some things on the 2nd floor with me on the 22nd floor. Breakfast is in the adjacent Italian restaurant. What looks romantic in the evening looks completely different in daylight hours. After going in I was told that I had to have a voucher for breakfast and that it should have been given to me at check in. So back upstairs with the s l o w elevator only to hear that it had been forgotten at check in. Back downstairs in the s l o w elevator. The buffet gives the impression it is an after thought. It’s all bit uncared for. The backroom in the restaurant definitely needs a makeover, everything is a bit dingy. Unfortunately that is where the buffet is set up. We are here for another couple of days and hope that it gets better.On a positive note, the staff is friendly, the rooms are clean, the bed is very comfortable and the tv is good but further for me it is all a bit outdated and tired.","London, United Kingdom","dutchie50Rotterdam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",13,3.0

The female at the reception bluntly refused to do so even knowing that i had a 4 year old kid with me. I had to get my tour manager involved , argue with them & then only they changed the room.

It can take a solid 5 minutes, which becomes worse during peak mornings, especially on a Thursday where people are checking out.

We chose the Financial District because my daughter’s apartment is very close to the hotel. The hotel location is indeed great. There is a Duane Read just around the corner as well as a Starbucks, Chipotle, Broadstone Bar & Kitchen (we ate there twice—it was great) among many other interesting bars, coffee shops and restaurants (it is NYC after all). There were some good things about the hotel and bad things. I think the bad things outweighed the good. While it wasn’t a horrible experience, I’d probably look elsewhere for my next hotel.First the good. The bed was comfortable. Overall the room was clean. Our room had a nice large LG flatscreen. The price was good. The staff was great. As mentioned, the location is great. And the bad. If I could offer only one piece of advice: make sure you get a non-adjoining room. When we first arrived and got to our room, within 30 seconds, the first thing we noticed was the loud talking, TV and singing coming from the room next door. Turns out we had an adjoining room that has a door between rooms. So there’s essentially no sound insulation because of that door. We could actually make out what our neighbors were saying (which included some obscenities—yay!). I immediately went straight down to the front desk to see if we could switch rooms to a non-adjoining room. Unfortunately, they were apparently booked that day and couldn’t switch us. But, we were able to switch to a quieter, non-adjoining room the next day. We got a king sized bed and my feet hung over the end of the mattress. I’m 6’1”. This must be a NYC thing because the rooms are so small—the same thing happened at a Holiday Inn Express in NYC just recently. I found that odd.Another odd thing: the only bedside electrical outlets are up next to the raised bedside lights. If you take a look at some of the traveler photos, you can see the bedside lights I’m talking about. So, in actuality, if you’re charging your phone, camera, smartwatch, what have you, the cord will be hanging down towards the bedside table. If you have a short cord, this could make charging awkward.As mentioned by numerous other reviews, the elevators are hit or miss—usually miss. In one instance I had to wait about 6 minutes for an elevator. Now, in the grand scheme of things, 6 minutes may not seem like a long time. But take the opportunity to stand there, wherever you are and set a timer for 6 minutes. It’ll seem like an eternity if you imagine you’re waiting for an elevator. By the time the elevator arrived and I got to the ground floor, there were perhaps 15 people waiting for that elevator. Also note that the front desk is on the 2nd floor. This is not immediately clear when you enter the hotel from the street. We entered, went to the elevators, then, confused, went back outside and thought maybe the entrance with the front desk was around the corner of the building. We asked a staff member outside and they clarified it’s on the second floor. So we went back in, around to the elevators, and sure enough there is a sign on the wall indicating that the front desk is up one floor. Reading other reviews, we’re not the only guests that had this problem. Perhaps they should put a big floor sign, right when you walk in, indicating that check in is on the 2nd floor. One of the worst things was the bathroom. There’s practically no counter space. There’s a small 2-3 inch or so ledge around the raised sink and a small glass shelf above the toilet, half of which is taken up by a tray featuring 3 tiny bottles of soap, shampoo and conditioner (which no one will probably use). That’s it. And the cramped shower (just a stand up shower—not a tub/shower combo) had very low pressure and the door wasn’t sealed properly so after each shower, I was left with a small puddle of water on the floor. And the lighting was horrible. If you’re in to mood lighting I guess it’s OK. But, if you’re trying to do make up or something, good luck!The air conditioner was loud, dirty and the front grill was hanging on by a thread. I tried to brace it to stop the knocking and rattling, and the grill fell off. Lastly, when I checked in on a Saturday for a Saturday - Thursday stay I was told it was actually 2 reservations and that I would have to actually “check out” Tuesday. Not a real checkout. We didn’t have to change rooms or anything. But I had to go to the front desk on Tuesday to “check out” and I guess check back in. All they did was take my key cards, update them, and then hand the same cards back to me. Then I was good until the real check out on Thursday. Not a huge deal, but very weird and a bit of a hassle as I had to make an additional trip down in their unpredictable elevators. If you’re looking for a room for one person in the Financial District and can deal with some annoyances, this could be a safe bet. Otherwise, it might be a good idea to look elsewhere if you have that luxury.","Centennial, Colorado","TravisJett</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Centennial, Colorado</strong>",4,3.0

We had a parking package that despite confirming on check in and check out I received a charge posted to my AMEX a few weeks later..... so just be sure that you check your bill!The electricity went out in our room because someone had moved the phone from the side of the bed to across the room and either maintenance or housekeeping never bothered to repair the problem. The staff was pleasant enough, but the whole property just seemed to be poorly run. Breakfast was my chosen HHonors benefit but when you got down to breakfast they pointed us off to a mediocre breakfast buffet being attended to by a fairly inept waiter.The room was small and the bathroom was VERY POORLY appointed. I'm not sure who designed the bathroom but it had a very low sink with practically no place for 2 people to place toiletries. There were no towel bars and the shower had no accommodation for someone to shave their legs. The shower had55 one tiny little corner shelf that was totally inadequate and they didn't even bother to put a foot rest in for a lady to use to shave her legs. The only forethought put in to planning this bathroom was to save money!This is without a doubt the worst Hilton property I have ever stayed in my 25 plus years of being a Hilton member.

I had a king sized bed but my feet were still hanging off at the end of the bed. I suspect that due to the size of the room, they turn the bed to the side and push the length side to the wall.At night time, I could hardly sleep as a weird noise was coming from the bathroom (almost like the cistern was constanly filling up with water).After my first night, they did not clean my room, even though I left the room at 8.15am. The next day, I wanted to put the sign of ""Cleaning please"" outside my door but there is not such sign in this hotel.Finally, drinking water does not come with these rooms. I ventured to one of the floors that has an ice machine, hoping that the machine would also give filtered water. No luck there.

Three tiny lifts to serve such a tall building is almost a running joke in this hotel among staff and guests alike.

They are over-worked at peak time leading to audible sighs by the dozen.What’s super bizarre is just how many strange people it attracts: not foreigners or business people as you might expect but weird locals with pot noodles in their bags, booze on their breath and all kinds of crazy coming out of their mouths. No matter what time of day. I can’t speak for the food or the drink because there is no restaurant to speak of in the evenings. The dead flowers and hedges outside do however make for bad vibes on your way to work.

The desk is minimalist in size, I would prefer a larger desk, but it is workable.This hotel practices energy efficiency in rooms lighting to a fault. I couldn't get a confident read on color matches anywhere in the room! Some hotels only provide one bright light in a room, this hotel managed to provide no bright lights. Ironically, the best light in the room was the ceiling light over the door entry!!! I found that to be an odd priority with respect to lighting. If I was managing this hotel, I would replace some of the bulbs with efficient, higher light output versions. It would make a big difference.The bathroom mirror was well designed with respect to providing even lighting without shadows, with long diffused lights on the right and left side of the mirror. The bulbs just aren't bright enough, emitting more of a glow instead of illuminating the area brightly. The sink is way off center from the mirror lights. The sink is nearly aligned with one of the edge lights, resulting in an inconvenient shadow if you are using the sink (such as one would be when removing makeup or shaving). The shower was nice. My particular shower had a couple of issues, however. The drain was very slow, so during the shower I ended up standing in a deep puddle (nearly high enough to flow onto the bathroom floor). The bottom 3 inches of the shower door were missing the splash seal, so that a significant amount of water escaped during the shower and created an inconvenient puddle on the floor outside the shower.The phone in the room was filthy - the housekeeping staff needs to be trained to to wipe off the phones periodically.I was awakened at least twice each night by noise in the hallway. Apparently the door doesn't seal out noise very well and falls short of what other hotels in the class accomplish.As others have noted, the elevator situation at this hotel is less than optimal. The building is relatively new, but apparently had a poor architect that didn't think that a service elevator was essential (or centered sinks!). During the day it is not uncommon to have a staff member with a cart consuming a significant portion of the elevator. Just be prepared during peak times (such as 8am-9:30am) to wait excessively long for an elevator.Despite the issues I have listed above, otherwise the hotel does a good job. The door staff was very helpful and attentive. The location was excellent. It was an easy walk any where I needed to go. I would stay here again.","Chicago, Illinois","SGillinois</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",22,3.0

This hotel only has 3 elevators to serve 44 floors leading to long wait times. Also, the staff use the same elevators to take loads of garbage down to the ground floors, to move furniture from floor to floor, etc. This means elevators are sometimes full of staff rather than guests and they don't exit the elevators to allow guests to use them. 2. There are only ice machines every 3 or 4 stories so you have to either wait for elevators or use the stairs to access an ice machine unless you are lucky enough to be on a floor with one. I was using the stairs to go to another floor to get ice when I came upon a group of malodorous people having some sort of meeting in the stairwell. They grumbled as I squeezed by to go up the stairs. I did not use the stairs again and I warned my wife not to move about the hotel without me being present. 3. I noticed unsavory looking people outside the hotel smoking while sitting in nearby doorways or sitting on the steps of the near by subway station. I later found myself on the hotel elevator with some of the same people!?? 4. As you'd expect, the bathrooms are small with only a small glass shelf above the toilet. If you are not careful, items can fall in the toilet. 5. My final advice regarding this hotel is you may want to check on the internet regarding this hotel as you may find some interesting things about it that staff can't tell you.",texas,"texasgayler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>texas</strong>",0,2.0

The staff is very nice, the hotel is in a great location around the street from the Battery, the statue of liberty can be seen after a short walk, and there are several restaurants close by as well as a very convenient Starbucks and Duane Read around the corner.We were staying on the 32nd floor, so word of warning, if you're staying on one of the upper floors you will have to wait anywhere between 3-10 minutes for an elevator depending on what time of the day you are trying to travel. Also, the seal on our shower didn't work, so we had to soak up the water on the floor after each shower, which was a hassle, but not a big deal and I doubt it's a problem in every room. We didn't bother to complain about it while we were there.If you're a man over 6 feet or are traveling with a man over six feet tall, you may want to find other accommodations. My fiancé is 6'7, and his feet were hanging off the end of the king sized bed. We have a queen bed at home and it's not a problem, so the beds at the Doubletree run shorter than normal and you should be aware of that. I also was not a fan of the feather pillows because they don't hold their shape, but that's a personal preference.The hotel is convenient to the Staten Island Ferry as well as the Whitehall and Bowling Green subway stops. Also, I was there with my family who were staying at a different hotel close by and the Doubletree staff were nice enough to give them cookies too.

I was not as impressed as the first time. I was greeted upon arrival on Sunday, 1/14/18 on the street level by a long line of people waiting for the elevator. Some had been there for a while. In a building that is 44 stories there has to be more than two elevators working especially in the evening when many people are arriving. Because of the hotel's layout with check-in on the second floor, that means two waits to get up to my room. After a while I gave up on the elevator and made my way with heavy suitcase, laptop, and another item and schlepped up the steps to the 2nd floor lobby, where yet another several people were camped out waiting for the same elevators.I was checked in quickly since I had bypassed those who were still downstairs waiting. My Hilton Honors Diamond status was recognized with 2 water bottles. Although I had checked in a day ahead and selected a room on the 30th floor, staff had upgraded me to the 44th floor, which I believe is the highest.The room was again what one would expect in NYC. Tiny with best use possible made of the space available. Bathroom leaves noplace to put down any toiletry bags or the items themselves.Good night of sleep and minimal noise from outside at that altitude. However, the heat could have been a little quieter. Controlling the temperature of the room was fairly easy once I got the hang of the thermostat.In the morning, I could not get hot water for a shower. It was ice cold despite the fact I ran it for 20 minutes. One negative aspect of the shower is that where the only door is placed, one has to put their hands through the flow of water to turn the shower on or off or adjust temperature. That made it more uncomfortable since it was very cold.When I checked in, the front desk assured me that breakfast would start at 6 AM. I even verified this knowing it would be a holiday, and they said yes it would be open. So around 6:30 I took another elevator ride to the ground floor lobby, to find the restaurant closed. Back upstairs again , and then I went down again at 7 AM and it was open. I was able to partake of the buffet quickly and be on my way. The food was good, and I appreciated it being on the house.Upon check-out, I told the front desk about the water issue, and I was told that it was known that the 44th floor had a problem and that maintenance was addressing it. That would do me no good, since I was already leaving. I did not complain about the elevators, since the evening crowds waiting for it had to be witnessed by the staff the night before. I did receive an apology for the water temperature as I scratched the dandruff out of my hair and heaved my luggage back down the stairs to the ground level to avoid one more elevator wait.There are many hotels in this area, and generally those in the financial district are better priced than Midtown. If you have nothing to do but wait for elevators, this property comes recommended. Once you do get to the room you paid for, it is comfortable. It's also easy to get to from subways in the South Ferry area.","Lakewood, New Jersey","kevinkorell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lakewood, New Jersey</strong>",48,3.0

Quiet, at 44th floor at least.Con:Customer Service - The DoubleTree Hilton page says we will get welcome cookies - none.When we booked the room 1 month prior, we asked for a quiet room with a view. We got a beautiful view of....buildings.I called the hotel right after booking through TravelZoo to mention that we did submit a request that we will be on our honeymoon. The hotel said it's not in their notes and will get that added.Also that we might be arriving around 9am, can we check in early if a room is available - the answer was absolutely!When we called from the airport asking the status of the room, we spoke to LaTonya and she was very curt and dismissive - we don't have a room available and there is nothing she can do about it, and hung up.When we arrived at 12pm, no honeymoon notes as well. We checked in and went up to the 44th floor, only to find the key card was not working. So, another 15 minutes waiting for elevator, down to 2nd floor lobby, and... just too tired to even explain.And we got a plate of fruits for our honeymoon. Fruits. Really?Structure - What you see in the page is NOT the entrance of this hotel, it's the WINDOW of their restaurant.The entrance is on the side, congested. And the restaurant is congested, the lobby is on 2nd floor (strange) and you guessed it, congested.3 elevators for 44 floors and they are not programmed to run simultaneously. So, unless you wake up super early and return super late, expect to wait at least 15 minutes for the elevator.Not to mention the running elevator will stop at all the floors where people want to get on, and the worst thing is if you want to go to the lobby, you have to get off on 2nd floor and wait another 15 minutes to get to the ground floor. With large bags, the elevator can squeeze in 3 people.Cafe - they are very partial towards the business patrons rather than the tourists. No one really paid attention to us. The coffee was good though, never tried the food, cos the place was congested.Heating - the room was overly warm at night. We had the air conditioning down to 65F, but it did not help. We got up a couple of times at night to get water as the heat made our throats very dry.Room - the carpet was very dusty, like it was hastily vacuumed and only on the major area of the room. My husband bent down to pick something that rolled under the bed and could not stop sneezing afterwards.The coffee area only had 1 creamer.Bathroom - I liked the standing shower, but figuring out the water temperature was a pain. It was either freezing cold water, or scalding hot shower. We never got the happy medium. we took scalding hot showers.The shower gel and shampoo were Lemon Verbena scent and were in very tiny bottles, which were alright.Tools - the hairdryer worked great, but there was hair on the comb that was in the little sack the hairdryer was in, so, that was gross.Accessibility - Great! Right down the street Staten Island ferry, Bowling Green Subway station, Statue Cruises. It takes 15-20 minutes to get to Times Square. There is Chipotle and a pharmacy right around the corner.All in all, I would say, the cons outweighs the pro and I am not sure if I would book at this hotel again.

The cons related the overall design and condition of the building. The entrance is very under whelming...in fact I initially thought I was using the service entrance, as the dim and narrow space contained linen/service carts, and some checked luggage. Fortunately a friendly staff member pointed me to the second floor lobby for check in. As others have noted, the elevators are small, and it appears there are only two available to service guests for a 40 story building resulting, in long waits during peak periods. Finally, the condition of the room left something to be desired. While modern in decor and generally clean, it was definitely well used, with damaged bathroom and lighting fixtures, peeling ceiling paint, and torn curtains.

My biggest disappointment is that the hotel is aware of who book thru Hilton and who is part of their loyalty program. There was no water in the rooms as part of the Gold HHonors program and asking for any type of service seemed to be an inconvenience for the hotel. When I called to raise the complain, Andreanis was very quick to say that she was not responsible and was not her the one to point the finger at.

It treads on the same path as the American airliners where service standards seems to be somewhat different from the rest of Europe and the Middle East. No refrigerator in the room which seems to be odd for a supposedly a 4 star hotel. There are only 2 lifts/elevators which is not sufficient and seems to take ages to arrive (expect to keep 8-15 mins on hand just to come down or go up in busy times).Breakfast is good if not the best, but a word of caution - entry for breakfast seems to finish 15 mins before the closing time hence best to be there with good time on hand.No concierge but ground floor staff can assist with odd queries.Overall, staff are great and polite.Tip.

Cons: 1) Elevators are small and extremely slow (3 elevators 44 floors and no separate service elevator for the staff, so elevators are sometimes full with carts). I intentionally picked a room on the 44th floor so at least I knew there would be room to get on the elevator. One trip up took 17 minutes (10 minute wait and 7 minute ride)2) Horrible smoke smell piped into my room - it smelled like someone was smoking a cigarette and weed in my room at the same time. Gross and unhealthy. 3) Housekeeping did not leave new toiletries. I wasn't about to brave the elevators to go back to the front desk to get more, so had to forego washing my hair since no shampoo or conditioner4) Room and bathroom are very small - difficult to maneuver around with two people in the room I read previous reviews, so I knew about the elevator and the small rooms. I can live with that - I'm in NYC so those are realities. What tipped my review to only two stars is the horrible smoke smell and the lack of toiletries.

Really chose the hotel due to its location being near to where my sister lives and the fact that you can walk to so many places - Battery Park for the ferries, South sea ports, China Town, Little Italy, Brooklyn Bridge, Freedom Tower and the memorial pools and the Occulus. Also very near to subway station where you can catch trains to Brooklyn, Central Park, Times Square etc all reached within about 20/25 minutes by train. I was slightly disappointed upon arrival at the look of the hotel - its above a restaurant with 'net curtains' at its windows that looked like they needed a good wash!! The hotel reception is on the second floor. We arrived at 2pm but sadly our room wasn't ready so we were told to leave our luggage and return an hour later. This meant taking our luggage back down to the ground floor where concierge looked after it for us. Upon our return an hour and a half later our room still wasn't ready and it actually took around a further 30 minutes or so until it was. The gentleman called Will on reception gave us a voucher to use in the restaurant below the hotel as an apology for the delay which was very nice and we used it one lunchtime and the food was very good. Our room was on the 35th floor with a view of the East river in between a couple of buildings. It was a very small room, the bed was very comfortable although the furniture was rather dated and although we were supposed to have a sitting area there was only one rather shabby desk chair. The room itself plus the bathroom were very clean and was cleaned every day to a high standard. I am a light sleeper so sadly I was kept awake by the ice machine in the corridor very near to our room which would make noises during the night as it made ice. You would then get inconsiderate hotel guests wanting ice at ridiculous times of the night/early hours of the morning. Although being 35 floors up you could also still hear car horns, traffic, dustcarts, builders working etc during the night plus guests who don't give a second thought to letting their room door slam shut. Perhaps the hotel could look at ways of having the doors shut slower or quieter as that's very annoying. After three nights of being kept awake by the ice machine I asked if we could change rooms. Will once again helped us out and we were able to move to a room on the 6th floor where there was no ice machine. We did loose the view but I needed to sleep so it was worth it. This room was bigger with an armchair in addition to the desk chair which I had been expecting in our original room. It was also a room which had a connecting door to another room and I did hear the occupant of that room return around 1am one night and then make a phone call. I could hear her on the phone for about 20 Minutes. As previously said I am a light sleeper so maybe I'm just unlucky but again it's just another guest who doesn't consider their surroundings. On a more positive note ALL the staff were really friendly/helpful and the different concierge would always welcome you upon arrival or wish you a pleasant day/evening when you went out. Will was extremely helpful. The lift situation as mentioned in other reviews was a little annoying but once we moved down to the 6th floor if it arrived and we couldn't get in then we would just walk down. This was no real hardship and we would have done the same even if we had been up as high as say the 10th floor. Overall the hotel was adequate for our needs and I feel that wherever you stay in a city like New York you will hear noise from outside.","Essex, United Kingdom","13sazza13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Essex, United Kingdom</strong>",5,3.0

We wanted a hotel from a Manhattan but not from straight center and we ended up choosing DoubleTree Hilton Financial District.The price was surprisingly low compared to other Hiltons which was great for our budget.When we reached the hotel after 13 hours of traveling we were happy to notice that our room had been upgraded to city view room with an AMAZING view to the One World building on the 43rd floor. There is a coffee maker on each room and beds are super comfy!Reception was nice, the staff was friendly and very helpful (special thanks to Alex ).

The hotel is located to the very bottom of the Manhattan which is nice and calm area. There is a subway station right next to the hotel for the R and W metros which go straight to the Time Square in 15 minutes and back.

Barely an apology from the front desk and no offer to fix it for our one night stay. Literally nothing in the room. No hotel pens or overpriced water you can buy.

Check-in was not a problem, and it was especially welcoming how the doormen greeted you upon arrival each time you went back into the hotel. I noticed that the room size and elevators were an issue in some reviews, but in my experience, I did not have much of a problem with this.

All you have to do is ask and you will get service with a smile. They will always aim to please. When we checked in we were given warm cookies which are delicious and a nice touch I thought. You can also have complimentary bottles of water every day too.We were not comfortable with the first room we were given as it was very small. I know it's to be expected as we were in NY however it would have felt, in our opinion, very claustrophobic for a 7 night stay. We asked for a bigger room and the hotel very kindly upgraded us on the second night once a bigger room became available.The second room was lovely , very spacious and clean. We had a view of the river which was an added bonus. The room was cleaned to a very high standard every day.The concierge staff are fantastic! They will answer any question you may have or sort out taxis for you.We didn't eat at the hotel at all as we like to go out to explore the local area and we found some amazing places to eat. Would we stay here again? The answer would be yes without a doubt! * Not a hotel related issue but a little word of warning.....Thankfully the hotel booked us a taxi through Uber on our way back to the airport. This was much cheaper than the traditional yellow taxis they have waiting outside of the airport when you land! The Uber price includes any toll or tip fees. The yellow taxi we were advised to get as it is a 'set fee' is not so set after all! The taxi driver insisted on a 25% tip on top of our fare. We travelled from Newark to the Financial District. We were made to feel very uncomfortable by the driver and did end up paying just so we could get out of the cab! Please don't get caught out like we did.

We arrived late so did not pay much attention to our room until the next morning. We were very unhappy to find it was not clean at all. Dust and dirt on every surface. After asking to move our second room was cleaner but the carpet was completely filthy and sticky all inside the bedroom door and most of the way around the bed. It hadn't been deep cleaned since the winter! We were offered a further room but by this point we had lost confidence in the hotel cleanliness and decided to put up with the dirty carpet because we doubted any room was completely clean. I had to keep my shoes on in the room the entire stay. Very disappointed! Water... On three occasions we did not have any hot water to take a shower. On the first occasion we were told by the front desk later that we should have been notified of maintenance but no letter arrived under our door. That day (our wedding anniversary )we had to take cold showers to make our reservation. On the second two occasions we found the warm water would arrive after about 30mins of the shower running. Again not quite the facilities you expect of a Hilton operated hotel. Security... We were shocked to find our guest room was left unlocked and OPEN! when we returned from a day out in the city. The room service had been in to clean and obviously not checked the door on the way out as the catch was preventing the door from closing. We were lucky as nothing was taken from the room but given there is no security at street level potentially anyone could have found a way in taken our belongings.

Upon reception, the agent did check me in early which I did appreciate greatly, but I did not receive the standard welcome treat of Double Tree... the delicious chocolate chip cookie. My room was on the 41st floor. Entering I did have a very small room although it was well cleaned. My view was great as I had a view of WTC 1. The A/C was great when it was 67, but if you clicked it higher than that it became a sauna in the room. The bathroom amenities in my room were not complete upon arrival. The shower leaked all over the floor upon every use and required more than 2 towels to sop up the excess water. The noise level in the room was acceptable until the neighbors came back and you could feel every vibration from doors closing to drawers being closed. What was aggravating was the elevator. On more than one occasion it took me from the 41st floor to Ground floor an average of 9 minutes in a warmed elevator. Slow and some of the occupants that got on from the lower floors appeared to be street people who had been allowed to stay the night at the hotel. They had their carts with their belongings with them. While I think that is a great idea and a worthy cause... I was just shocked to see them in a Double Tree. Lastly, two major complaints were upon returning from a very long day out and about on a warm day in NYC -- one of the elevators was out which took getting up to my room quite a while and then also upon entering my room seeing a notice that I had no water with no expected turn on time due to an emergency and for ME to ""prepare myself accordingly"". All I wanted to do was take a shower and could not. Some of the good things were the staff were nice and tried to be helpful when able. This just did not seem to be ""in step"" with the full Double Tree experience that I have encountered in the past. I would NOT recommend this hotel as a Double Tree.

Stayed here for 6 nights Jun-Jul 2017. The entrance to the hotel gives a bad first impression its a side door into a poorly laid out hallyway and you have to take the elevators to the second floor to check-in. The elevators are very slow and small so when the do arrive they are often already full. The rooms are average size for a city hotel (we stayed in a queen room) but they have everything you need. The carpet could use a good steam clean as our feet were sticking to it in places i actually wasn't comfortable in bare feet and thus wore my socks at all times. The blackout curtain hem had fallen away and needs to be sewn back, the air conditioning unit and the celine fan in the bathroom could both do with a thorough dusting. The outside noise is less here than you would expect however the walls between rooms are paper thin and on more than 1 occasion not only were we woken by our neighbours tv/talking but when they close their bedroom door the entire wall shook along with the head of the bed! Also other guests were clearly smoking weed as the smell was unmistakable and this made me uncomfortable as I was travelling with my daughter -I am unfamiliar as to the laws in NYC if this is legal or not but they were not hiding it and the hotel staff didn't appear to be bothered. All in all it's a basic hotel not the worst but not the best either. I would certainly say I was disappointed with the Doubletree on this occasion attention to the details make a huge difference.

It was much bigger than the bed at the Hilton Grand Central. There was free breakfast. Although, they forgot to register my guest even though I was assured at check in that it would be done. However, it was fine. I was given two vouchers without any issues. Yet, it should have been given at check-in. Breakfast was adequate enough, but not enough choices and it was very dry and bland. Quite tasteless muffin and oatmeal. Also, the hot water took too long to come on and I hope slippers can be provided in the room. Service was quite good though. A lot of the people were friendly and they would acknowledge you even from maintenance and bellhop. Recognition to Tracy and Tina for smiling service. Maybe, an executive lounge in the future?

The service was OK – impersonal but professional, as you’d expect from a big chain in a business district. The rooms were OK – clean and fairly spacious by Manhattan standards, although the bed was unable to fit all 6’2” of me lying down without my feet dangling over the edge, and the in-room coffee & tea service had plenty of coffee but almost no milk. We had a city view, which was OK. The area is OK – easy to get to and quiet at night, but with a lot of construction going on nearby. In fairness the wifi was free and fast, and the gym was above average – small but with everything you need, and with 24 hour access as well.However, I hate to echo what other reviews have said but it’s a reality here – the elevators are terrible. There are only three elevators serving 44 floors; so unless you stay on a low floor, or only come & go between around 8pm and 5am, you are going to spend a significant amount of time standing in a corridor waiting for an elevator to arrive.If you want somewhere with character and/or in the thick of the Manhattan hustle & bustle, this is not the hotel for you.

This property is located in the financial district in lower Manhattan. It is in walking distance of South Street Seaport, Staten Island Ferry, and a host of local eateries. The hotel is a high rise structure with five elevators. The check in desk is located on the second floor, which will require an elevator ride or taking the stairs, the elevators take a while. The business center and refreshment area is also located on the second floor. The front desk staff was friendly, professional, and accommodating. Our room was on the 33rd floor. The halls were clean but tight. We had a king room with a restricted view of the East River (see pictures). The room included a king bed, single serve coffee maker, 40"" inch tv, desk, two night stands, an armchair, and a shower stall in the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable and there was no issue with noise from the hallways or adjoining rooms. For a quick turn around stay with a very familiar friend or loved one, this room and hotel can be very accommodating.

Cost- affordable as compared to other hotel options in that area.5. Offer: the Hilton website had a spring sale on which offered us premium wifi and complementary breakfast for our stay.Cons:1. View: totally depends on the wing and location of the room. Ours being on the 19th floor didn't had that of a great view as the property is surrounded by buildings. Higher floors might have better.2. Our stay had complementary breakfast which required breakfast coupons to be presented at the restaurant. We didn't know this and had to collect them from the checkin counter (which is on a different floor from the restaurant) ourselves the next day when we went in for the breakfast. Had they given us those coupons the time we checked in, it would have saved us time and efforts.3. Room service- we asked for a pasta which was supposed to come with bread and butter.

NYC is incredibly expensive, and if you're visiting from out of town, you don't want to spend $500+ per night just for a bed. $180/night for a hotel room in Manhattan sounds like a steal, but the real steal is by Hilton, from your wallet. This is the third time I have had the displeasure of staying in this hotel this year, and none of those times have been by choice. My firm put me up in this hotel for work in March and after two nights of not having hot water in the shower, I was allowed to switch to the Marriott on West Street (it's about $40 more per night and stunningly beautiful - I highly recommend it). The last two times (including this time - I'm currently staying there until tomorrow night and then I'm free, thank god) were not by choice. I've been swapping out one hotel room with a few rotating colleagues over the last month and a half. While I've had hot water these last two times (save for the 5 minutes of freezing cold hell this morning), neither handset for the phones work (I complained about this a month and a half ago and they have yet to fix it - I had to yank the battery out of one because it wouldn't stop beeping) and the elevators actually seem to have gotten worse. Idiots who stay in the hotel (and I've seen staff members do this too) think that pushing the up and down buttons at the same time will make the elevator come faster, but it just screws up the scant logic the elevators already run on and makes a terrible problem exponentially worse. If you're on an upper floor, plan at least 15-20 minutes to be able to get to the ground floor (that is not sarcastic). This building was built without a service/freight elevator, so the cleaning and maintenance staff make use of the three elevators, which causes all kinds of problems for the guests. Oh, and due to a unique NYC initiative, the hotel is currently housing several homeless New Yorkers. The reaction from tourists when they get on the elevator is quite entertaining, so that might be the only cheery side to this hellish hotel. The rooms are tiny, there is inadequate storage, there is no place to put anything in the bathroom, the keys require a midas touch and the patience of a saint to work, and the front desk staff is usually pretty rude. Also, there is no maintenance staff after 11pm or before 7am, so good luck if you have a maintenance emergency at 11:01. My advice: please stop staying at this hotel, let it close down, and maybe they'll level it and rebuild it correctly.",,Eric S,1,1.0

The only thing I was unhappy with was that I was not allowed to take my bicycle to my room, due to fire code. The room was spacious, bike could have fit on side wall without any trouble. Had to leave bike in garage, an additional cost of $7/day. Other than that the location is great, around the corner is the Charging Bull and Fearless Girl statue, short walk to staten island ferry ride to see the statue of liberty and about a 10-15 minute walk to world trade center.

In the room, it was all we could hear so we immediately rang reception and requested another room. At first they seemed reluctant to let us switch rooms but after reciting a brief tale of woe, they were quick to act and moved us to a room on the 8th floor which was much quieter (albeit with an inferior view).The rooms are compact but meet all requirements with a great shower and huge bed. Amenities like hairdryer, TV and coffee machine are also included.Housekeeping was daily but sometimes like to come early (sometimes as early as 9) so make sure you put the sign on the door.The location is spectacular with subway stops at the end of the road and another one on the other side of the museum. They were doing some renovation works to the main entrance when we arrived so the exterior wasn't amazingly pleasant at the time although this was not a problem for us.All in all, this hotel met expectations.

Another 30 minutes pass and we’re told we need to stay in the original room and would be moved the following night. the following night we’re in a new room, but the room didn’t appear to have been cleaned (toilet seat left up, sheets have holes in them, trash on floor). at this point I’ve given up and am glad we have a bathtub for our son to bathe in. Our third and last night we come back to our room and the keys don’t work. I’m told that’s because we needed to go back down to the front desk and get new ones since there was a second reservation for the last night (this i asked on at least 5 different occasions about prior and every time i was told ‘no problem, you don’t have to do anything’) now’s a good time to mention that the elevators in this hotel need reprogramming. on average it took us 15 minutes to get to our floor from the ground floor.

I'm relieved that I ignored them and stayed here, we had a lovely stay. When we first arrived after a long journey we were told that they didn't have our booking on their system, not really what you want to hear when your tired, but after a short wait and a few phone calls they eventually found our booking and gave us keys to a room on the 41st floor. The room was beautiful, lovely big comfy king size bed and amazing view of the one world from our window. However we had a very unpleasant surprise at 7am when we were both woken up by loud banging and drilling from a construction site on top of a tower being built opposite. I'm a heavy sleeper and it woke me up, and even after putting ear plugs in I could still hear it. I went and spoke to reception about it and asked to be moved to the other side of the building, the receptionist said she didn't know of any construction work going on and it shouldn't be getting done at that time of the morning. I found this a strange comment, I'm really not sure how she couldn't possibly know about this massive building being built right outside the hotel! Luckily they had a room available later that day on the other side of the hotel. Our second room was on the 38th floor and was also a beautiful room, we were very happy and comfortable in it, it was spacious and we had a lovely view of the Hudson. Our room was cleaned every day, it was well equipped and most importantly we didn't hear any construction noise for the rest of our stay.The main concern for most people on here is the lifts at this hotel, and it's true that there is only three quite small lifts for this quite large hotel, and they can get quite busy especially as the housekeeping team also use them. Maybe we were just lucky but we had no problem getting or using these lifts, I think the longest we waited was a couple of minutes and the lifts are quick when they don't have to stop at different floors.The staff were very helpful at this hotel, they stored our bags for us when we changed rooms and on our last day as our flight was a late one, and reception did solve any issues we had. The main selling point in my opinion is the location of this hotel. It has subway stations on its doorstep that can get you anywhere in manhattan quickly enough, and has plenty of amenities nearby. There are some lovely bars and restaurants in the stone street area that stay open very late every night, and battery park ferry stop, charging bull and one world and 911 memorial are all easy walking distance from it.Overall we had a very pleasant stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay hear again next time we come back to this amazing city, and I would recommend this hotel to friends.

Nothing was stolen from our room, but we felt unsafe after we realized that the staff had been in the room and had opened the safe.

At first, I was a little worried as I read some reviews regarding slow elevators, old rooms, poor air conditioning, no hot water and rude staff. Thankfully, to my surprise, my experience was anything but similar to what I had read. I arrived an hour before check in time and was politely greeted by the front desk. I explained I was a little early and she had no problems checking me in early. I got my key cards and proceeded to my room on the 18th floor, and didn't have to wait long for the elevator. The rooms were clean, kept well and the shower had no issues at all. The room was cleaned properly and thoroughly each day and being a fan of The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, it was a nice perk having that as their coffee of choice in the rooms. My only not-so-perfect experience was one morning when I waited about 5-7 minutes for an elevator, but other than that, no complaints at all. The subway (Yellow line) to the city was also just at the corner of Stone street so it was easy getting around and transferring stations. Also, for those who want to take the Air Train to the airport, the staff informed me that one can just walk about 10 minutes and take the J or Z train and transfer to the Air Train to the airport, which is really convenient, and can save you $65 for a taxi. The total travel time took about 45 minutes to an hour so just keep that in mind.This was a great hotel, with great staff and a fantastic location so I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone. For those that may have had a less-than positive experience, I strongly suggest that you give this hotel another try, and chances are you'll be pleasantly surprised.","Vancouver, Canada","AntonVSG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",6,4.0

As soon as we arrived a lovely guy (didn't get his name) made us feel very welcome & took us to reception. Reception lady (again didn't catch her name) was friendly & gave us warm cookies. Our room was 704 & it was big enough for me, my partner & our child especially given the time we would spend in the hotel, there was also a big shower, the double beds did seem a little smaller than UK double beds but was perfectly fine & comfortable. A lot of reviews I read talked about the elevators I can honestly say we never experienced this, we stayed Friday to Monday but the lifts was there within a minute sometimes even less, this could be because 2 of our days fell over the weekend but even on the Monday when we left at 8am it came within a minute (maybe we was just lucky). I personally recommend the Staten Island ferry, it's free & runs every half hour 24hrs a day 7 days a week, you get a great view of Statue of Liberty & the Manhattan skyline & it's literally a 5 minute walk from hotel, we did it both in the daytime & nightime. I can highly recommend Murphys bar right next door to the hotel, food is lovely. When we checked out a really lovely guy called Tony was so friendly & helpful & stored our bags for us till we was ready to collect them & told us best way to get to Newark Airport. All in all we had a fab stay for our first time in NYC & if we go back we would definitely stay here again. If your looking for a no frills, cheap hotel that's clean & comfortable & just somewhere to lay your head in a great location this place is perfect if your looking for 5* luxury I've heard the Plaza or Four Seasons is good ",,Rebecca F,11,5.0

I stayed at this Doubletree on Sunday night, 1/29/17. I was there at a quite off-peak period, arriving around 9 PM and not checking out until 11 AM next morning; thus I did not experience issues with the elevators. I was greeted at the front desk with a smile by Tina. She was quite efficient and helpful. My Hilton Diamond status was recognized and rewarded. The room was what anyone should expect when staying in Manhattan. Yes it was small but I always find it interesting how hotels make use of the space available. I did not lack for anything, except space in the bathroom to put down my toiletries bag. Perhaps some of the foyer area space could be used to expand the bathrooms a bit.I got a good night of sleep, finding the bed and pillows comfortable. The temperature in the room was easy to control, and the HVAC system was not overly noisy.In the morning I went down to claim my buffet breakfast, and it was good. Upon checkout, Tina was there again and was as professional as the night before.The price was right for me, definitely a great deal for New York City.

Besides this and the helpful/friendly doormen, everything else was pretty average. The front desk staff appeared under staffed, when in the morning people were trying to check out or in our case get some assistance with the safe in the room there was only one member of staff at the front desk and a huge queue of people waiting to be served. This was a bit of a hassle as it was the one morning we had to be leaving quickly. It does seem like a lot of people have mentioned the wait times with the lifts and this was a bit of a pain. There's only three, quite small, elevators that you have to wait 90% of the time over 5 minutes for so if you're in a rush it's not ideal. Our main disappointment with our stay was the room cleanliness and the construction going on right across the road from the hotel. When we booked our stay and when we checked in we were never informed about the construction of a new building that would be starting/going on during our stay, so when you are woken up before 6am every morning with exceedingly loud drilling/banging noises is a bit of an inconvenience. If we had just been informed it wouldn't have been such a disappointment. To add to the disappointment of the stay was the cleanliness of the room. Our room was really pretty dirty. When you first walked in and looked around you would think the room maybe hadn't been occupied in a while due to the dust. The dust was everywhere when we arrived, in the drawers, on the dressing table, wardrobe, desk and it was really bad in the air conditioning unit. So when you went into the bathroom there was hairs everywhere, so clearly the room has been used recently. There was hairs in the shower, on the toilet and all over the sink. It really wasn't very pleasant. Apart from the disappointments we really enjoyed our time in NYC and just avoided being in the hotel for too long.","Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom","Nicole G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, Scotland, United Kingdom</strong>",9,3.0

We even had a small bathtub which was unexpected. There was an ice machine a few steps from our room which was very convenient. Having stayed for 5 nights, we cannot understand why so many of the reviewers have complained about the elevators - we used these every day and they usually arrived within a minute; the longest we waited during our whole stay was around 3 minutes and we stayed on the 20th floor. No issue at all with the elevators. The location is brilliant - there is a subway station right across the road and being in the Financial District we found it fairly quiet at night. On our last day, the security staff offered to hold our luggage for the day and gave us tickets to retrieve our bags upon our return.

Honestly? Not very impressed, especially for the money. But by all accounts this was one of the cheaper hotels in the city, so I think that compounds the issue. New York, it seems, is as over-priced as most major cities. In the financial district, the area felt very safe albeit rather lifeless out of hours. There really aren't many bars, shops or restaurants around. But it's conveniently located near a couple of metro stations and within walking distance of the Staten Island Ferry and Ground Zero.The lower ground entrance is completely uninspiring and the 2nd floor lobby is presentable but small. The building feels like it's been crammed between it's surroundings and just three lifts convey people between over forty floors. So you can wait ages to get up and down. One morning, we took the stairs down 36 floors, we got so sick of waiting. Not everyone is quite as fit!The first room we had - small, a tad tired, tap fell off, chest of drawers broken and single glazing meant we were woken at 06:30 by very loud building works, despite being high up. We changed rooms and while the second was nicer, a dividing door/thin walls and a screaming child meant we were still disturbed.Small things, like finding the coffee filter difficult to fill; no fridge; noisy air con; speakers with an old ipod dock connection (not lightening port) and no pay-per-view movies meant that a comfy evening in just didn't appeal. The restaurant is tiny and breakfast was mediocre to say the least. Stone cold buffet, reminiscent of Holiday Inn Express in the UK - it simply wasn't what I would expect of Hilton Doubletree.Staff were pleasant enough and handled any issues politely. But when we wanted to check out and pay with a different card, we learnt they had already settled the account. To my mind - you do that WHEN the guest departs, not before.At the end of the day, we weren't there for the hotel. It was a bed for the night. But when I think about the fact that I could get a 4* all inclusive week in Spain for less money, it really hacked me off. But as I say, it's New York. I know London and elsewhere aren't necessarily a great deal better.","Harrogate, United Kingdom","K9866QSmarkf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Harrogate, United Kingdom</strong>",62,3.0

My stepdaughter is getting married December 31st 2016 and she organized a block of rooms for some of us. My wife & I arrived at this hotel Late the 27th of December. The Main & only Entrance to the Hotel looks like your entering the loading dock. There were bins of garbage & laundry in front & inside the door. We asked the bellman if this was the main entrance and he saying yes. We unloaded our SUV onto 2 carts. So we were supposed to be staying here for 6 nights. My wife is always willing to give things a chance so we went to the 2nd floor to the Lobby front desk to check in. Upon entering our room that we were told was the largest room they have in the Hotel (Junior Suite) we realized immediately this room wasn't going to accommodate 3 people along with all of our luggage UGH! Again we thought we would give it a chance. Finally we got a chance to sit down after our 3 hour drive from CT. I included photos of the room to go with the next sentence. So what I noticed about the room was this: -Bathroom towels by the sink looked like the rags my housecleaner uses at my house / -the desk chair was ripped in two place and looked dirty / -sofa bed when pulled out would have blocked the way to the bathroom for us from the bed / -wallpaper was pealing off the walls in a couple of places / -phone looked like it hadn't been dusted in awhile /-our door looked like someone must have tried to break into the room at one point because of the damage to it /-the refrigerator was full of scratches & dents & didn't fit under the counter /-in the hallway in front more than one room there was garbage /-the hallway was so tight my wife couldn't extend her arms out all the way and last but not least the bed looked like at had been slept in, so I being the germaphobe that I am slept in my clothes and didn't even take off my shoes..... Pretty bad. After securing the Hilton Millennium for the rest of our stay & getting the Front Desk Manager to confirm I wouldn't be charged for the next five nights we came to grips with the fact that we were staying there for the night. Oh by the way the other Hotel gave us a lower rate. We also made sure to cancel our Cousin's room so they could come to the Millennium with us.

When I stay in a hotel, I like to have a TV that I can plugin a Chromcast or a Roku device. These options weren't available in my room. Typical Hilton breakfast buffet, not bad but not good either. I did eat dinner in the restaurant my first evening. I ordered a veal dish with mushrooms and artichokes. I enjoyed it very much. The second night I was worn out from a long day at work so I went for room service. I ordered a bowl of their lobster bisque and the New York Strip, medium rare. The lobster bisque was outstanding, probably the best I have ever eaten. The steak was ok. The steak was cooked properly but it did have a lot of gristle and it was entirely too large. At least two people could have eaten the steak and been full. It is a high rise hotel but there are only 3 elevators. It isn't unusual to wait a long time for an elevator and if it is a busy time of day, when one shows up it might be full.The only reason I didn't give the hotel 5 stars is the TV configuration.

After getting to the room we were surprised to discover this bed was a king single (which is a boarder line joke for two people to stay in) I rang up the front desk to ask if there was a room with anything bigger and after being on hold for 2min we were given a room with a king size bed as per our original reservation. I understand the explanation given to us why rooms are given up if guests don't arrive until after 6pm (to basically make sure you can always have your hotels beds full even though you don't seem to care if you honor your reservations into what room size they paid for). Upon having a shower in our new room we were surprised to find it flooded the bathroom and after complaints to the front desk over several days no action or compensation was offered so every time we had a shower the bathroom was flooded it was slippery to a point of dangerous and we constantly had wet towels to clean up the water. Questions:How can it be possible that over a period of around 7mins at 10.00pm our original reservation can go from not available to available??Secondly if the room is available why is it up to the customer to ring front desk and ask for our original reservation to be honored??Thirdly why was no compensation offered by the front desk - surely you would agree that a king single bed is deplorable to offer to two guests?? Is it standard operating procedures for the Hilton to provide showers that flood the bathroom every time it is used OR were we given a room that was actually defunct and should have not been given provided to a guests due to the danger of slipping and electrical shock exasperated by the water leaking into the bathroom. Room number was 4109. NEXT COMPLAINT:While we were checking in we were not asked to provide the details of the credit card we had booked the room under - however we did provide the details of a traveler card which we were told was not acceptable (even though money was here to provide any sort of deposit they hotel wanted.The credit card we booked the room under was actually a family members of ours and when we wanted to double check the details of the billing to do the differences in currency we were told to provide physical evidence of the credit card and after not accepting any other cards (which we had 3 debit/debit credit/traveler credit cards) I was forced to walk in the freezing cold to get $250 cash for the front desk and terribly rude manager until our family member could photo copy the credit card and paper work approving the use of this card.Messages were constantly left on our room phone by the front desk until the details were provided and it was a full 12 hours after the confirmation was emailed to hotel staff before we could get our cash ransom back which us the guest had to initiate conversations with the staff to get back. This all could have been avoided if 1) the staff member did their job when we checked in and 2) the hotel accepted any other card we offered when we checked in and when we were forced to leave a cash ransom.FINALLYUpon leaving the hotel they charged us for the room BUT DID NOT CHARGE THE CREDIT CARD WE WERE FORCED TO RUN AROUND GETTING APPROVAL FROM OUR FAMILY MEMBER BUT INSTEAD THEY CHARGED OUR TRAVELERS CARD!MY QUESTION IS WHAT WAS THE POINT OF MAKING A GUEST RUN AROUND FOR 2 DAYS GETTING PAPERWORK DONE FOR THE HOTEL IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO CHARGE THE CREDIT CARD EVEN THOUGH YOU ALREADY PLACED A HOLDING FEE??WHY WOULD YOU THEN NOT CHARGE THAT CARD AND INSTEAD CHARGE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CARD WHEN WE WERE TOLD THAT THE TRAVELERS CARD IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AS A DEPOSITI have stay at hostels in morocco for $2.00 per night that had FAR better service than this pathetic excuse for a hotelThis hotel and its staff have ruined my partner and I's experience of New York which was a once in a lifetime for us due to their complete inability to follow their own rooms, provide simple service and constantly hassle us for moneyI expect a full refund for the stress provided to my partner and I, plus I expect an apology from general manager","Warrnambool, Australia","Michael L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Warrnambool, Australia</strong>",1,1.0

We chose this hotel for our final two extra nights, moving from mid town.The view from our very comfortable and large room on the 41st floor was breathtaking. An amazing view of the new World Trade Centre tower.That view was worth the entrance fee alone.We spent lots of time just staring out the window at that tower. But when we weren't partaking of 'tower staring' we were out exploring the areas bars and restaurants. There was a great eat-in deli just around the corner called Essen which was amazing.As for this hotel. The room we had was the best out of the three we stayed at while in New York. Besides the view, the room was unexpectedly big with a great walk-in shower and an extremely comfortable bed. But as many have already said, the lift situation in this hotel is completely inadequate for a hotel with this many floors and rooms.I came out of the gym one morning, which is small but okay, situated on the 3rd floor. Instead of waiting for the lift up to the 41st floor, I decided to run up the stairs. I was amazed to find quite a few people coming from the lower floors (4 to about 15) with their suitcases down to check-out of the hotel. I stopped and asked one man why he wasn't waiting for the lift. He told me he had been waiting for half an hour at the 12th floor and whenever the lift door opened, it was packed tighter than a rugby scrum - dangerously overcrowded with no chance of getting in with his suit cases. So please bear this in mind if you go there. The hotel could solve this problem by installing another two lift shafts but they would have to lose quite a number of rooms to do this, and in this day and age of money-making, I can't see mr Hilton doing such a thing.If it wasn't for the lack of lifts, I would have given this hotel a five-star rating simply for the location and the views. Someone mentioned in a review about poor sound-proofing in this hotel. I think that goes for the rooms, too, as one afternoon while walking back to our room, we could clearly hear a couple who sounded as if they were having 'a really good time - a very loud 'really good time.' Ah, the joys of youth, hey. Well, we assumed they were young, and good on them, I say.So come on - mr Hilton - drop a few more lifts into this hotel, it deserves it.","Runcorn, United Kingdom","garysweeney9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Runcorn, United Kingdom</strong>",27,4.0

The bathroom seemed to be recently remodeled in the Euro style with a large walk in shower with glass doors. So much nicer than the old fashioned tub shower curtain combo many NYC hotels still have. Plenty of towels. The room size was more than adequate. It was square size so the desk was to the side and out of the way. Huge closet, bigger than many hotel rooms. The bed was very comfortable.

A five minute walk to Battery Park. A very safe and quiet location, near World Trade Center but not too close that there are throngs of people around.

Waits were huge to get an elevator and half the time they were full of people or stuff. Furthermore there was no security on the elevator requiring a room key to go up and the elevators were easily accessible from the street with the lobby on the second floor. We returned at 11 pm one night with nothing (not a person or technology) to stop anyone from going up the elevator.

In town for a wedding at a nearby venue. The positives were location and very nice and helpful doormen. The parking situation was difficult at best and the front desk staff were not helpful at all. The hotel rooms are tiny as is the bathroom, which wasn't a huge issue but not expected for a doubletree. There weren't enough pillows or towels for the room and our room was never cleaned while we were there. The elevator situation as others have stated is abysmal! Thank goodness we read the trip advisor reviews and requested a room on a lower floor and were given a room on the sixth floor. We used the stairs often and were glad we sacrificed the view.

On line the hotel looked great so we had hope. When we checked in Saturday we were greeted by an energetic and friendly gentleman at the front desk who presented us with two bottles of water and two warm chocolate chip cookies.These were the high points. When I inquired about an upgrade we told that the hotel was sold out and no upgrade was available, even though I am Hilton Gold. As a consolation I was told that WiFi was free. Like, WOW. In place of points we opted for coupons for a complimentary breakfast buffet. So we took our key and headed to the elevators for the trip up to our 34th floor room. What felt like an endless wait the elevator finally arrived. The room was clean and well appointed but compact even by NYC standards. The bathroom could not be smaller and had no place for a toiletries bag, good thing the bed was in easy reach. The bed was comfortable but the TV was small. Breakfast in the morning was served in a restaurant on street level. The food was ok but the layout of the buffet was a bit weird and the staff was running around like it was their first breakfast service ever. After our initial greeting at check-in it appeared that the hotel staff was overwhelmed and poorly directed/managed (we are both managers so we notice these things). We were glad we were on a high floor (don't expect amazing views) because people on lower floors could not get on the elevators because of crowding (think Lexington Avenue line during morning rush hour) . Oh, and did I mention the elevators are slow? Plan ahead and give yourself an extra 5-10 minutes to get down stairs (or you can use the stairs that give you access for all floors).

It's not the speed that's an issue, it's the fact that there are only three small elevators to serve the entire building with no dedicated service elevators. Waiting ten minutes for an elevator, only to have the one that arrives be filled to capacity with bags of soiled linens, is not what I expect to experience at a hotel of this caliber. Or any hotel, really. I have to wonder if they've tried making one of the elevators staff-only. Considering that a second elevator which might have had room for me passed my floor while the full laundry elevator was stopped, I'm not sure having all three elevators open to both guests and staff actually decreases wait times. If you are on a high floor, factor at least 10-15 minutes of either elevator wait time or stairs time into any plans. The room was much smaller than any I've ever had at the same price point, especially considering the discount I had as part of a wedding block. But I can chalk that up to paying for the Manhattan location. Very convenient to Battery Park (thus the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island), the World Trade Center site, the Staten Island Ferry, and Brooklyn which is just one stop away on multiple nearby lines.

Also, we were charged an extra $50 a night, which we were told we would get back, after checkout ...in about 5 days. I guess they hold that in the event they find damage to the room. Breakfast buffet...not so great either. I'm not usually the type to say anything bad about anywhere, but I knew I had to post regarding this hotel.

I picked this hotel based on location, price, and the Hilton brand. This hotel does not live up to the Hilton and double tree standards I expect. For visiting NYC and access to subways and landmarks the location is the best. The property is in need of major physical and staff upgrades. My arrival day front desk and concierge was horrific. I arrived early before Check in time and was turned away in a rude manner by the clerk and told to come back later. When I did I was given a room with a broken AC. The maintenance crew did a temporary fix but did not have replacement parts. It took them to argue with the front desk to change our room later. The elevator are slow to arrive. The reason is that staff do my have a dedicated elevator and use. Guest elevator. I have a pretty large list of what went wrong with this week long stay. Staff are not happy because they are low on supplies guest ( e.g toilet paper and parts to fix things). The treatment you get at front desk just depends on who is there. Do not leave your luggage with the concierge. On arrival day they made us retrieve our own luggage that we check when waiting 6 hours to check in and on departure day we found that our luggage was left unattended unsecured for 30 minutes.

My woes started even before I got there. The booking was made through booking.com and was supposed to be payable at the hotel with a no-show cancellation of the first night only. To start off, the hotel decided to block my credit card for the full amount plus incidentals plus extras (the reason for which the staff could not explain) for all three rooms. Due to this excess charged by the hotel, my credit card was over limit and the credit card could not be authorised for the third room. To sort this out, I added another credit card on the day of checkin and two hours later tried to call them to confirm all was fine. Somebody answered the phone after I rang 17 times and said (a) new credit card detail was still not there: and (b) it was not their job to check with booking.com and therefore, it was my role to ring booking.com to ask booking.com to contact the hotel. (Note: this was when I was running to catch a flight!). When I called booking.com and they tried to contact the hotel, the hotel would still not answer the call!The next bit was when I reached the hotel and asked about the credit card amount they authorised. They had no explanation for the excess and was adamant that the booking was supposed to be prepaid (all amounts paid in advance) which is not what was set out in my booking confirmation that I received from booking.com.The morning concierge staff was polite and helpful but we also had an incident with the evening concierge/ caretaker (on the ground floor) who was so arrogant and rude that he should be out of the service industry. We reported this and the evening manager very kindly and graciously offered us breakfast to make up for this incident. We are very grateful that he tried to make amends though such an incident leaves a very bad taste in one's mouth.Finally, we decided to make the final dues settlement at 9am on checkout day but requested that we keep the room till 11am. At about 10am, a member of the housekeeping team who barely spoke English came to prepare the room for the next guest and her only response was talk to Reception. Not sure why she would come to start cleaning when Reception was already aware that we would be in the room till later.On the plus side, the location was excellent (close to shops, restaurants, the subway and ferries) and the rooms were standard. One good point is that we had AC issues one night at 2am and they did send someone to sort it out. The wifi service was good as was the signature cookies.

Room is small but modern, bed is very up to Hilton standards, our view from the room was grand - onto new WTC tower and couple other nearby skyscrapers. Rooms service was good and room was cleaned up well. However, there were few issues as well. Our sink faucet was completely ripped out of the wall and then basically put back in place without securing it, so when we turned the water on, it completely detached from the wall. Another problem in the room was with the safe - it was not functional and did not work. However, both issues were quickly fixed once I notified hotel staff. As for outside the room, just like everyone else we had issues with elevators. We were on the top floor and our main issue was not getting into the elevator, but mainly making it all the way down. When we were checking out, I think we stopped on probably 15-17 different floors on the way down, while our elevator was already packed and completely full. The hotel is small (7-8 rooms per floor) but tall (44 floors) and has 3 elevators that are pretty speedy when they are not stopping on every floor. As long as you avoid rush hour traffic you should generally be OK. Also try to book the highest floor possible, at least you will be able to get into elevator. People on floors 15-25 could not even get into elevators as they were full coming all the way from the top. If you are bringing your own car, the hotel does not have its own parking. Instead they use parking lot across the street that gives you a discount rate ($40 a day vs regular $56 a day). When we arrived, parking lot attendant was behaving sketchy, asking us for tips saying that he is giving us a good rate (meaning $40/day) as if he was the one giving us the rate as opposed to Hilton. Just beware of that - it's a hotel rate. Finally, as Hilton Gold I was hoping for free breakfast but that was not included. I was advised that I can either get points for my stay or free breakfast. I deferred to points. Luckily, it is New York, and there are variety of breakfast places around, so you can easily find something for pretty much any taste.

We tried to alert the hotel staff to this issue, but no one answered the phone at the front desk. In our daughter's room, the air conditioner was not functioning properly and left the floor soaked. The issue was not fixed, the staff just left a towel over the wet area. We also filled out the breakfast card that was supposed to be picked up by staff before morning (so that we could have it when we woke up), but it was not picked up. When we called to place the order, we were told it would be there at 9 am, then we were called again to say it would be ready by 8:45 am. We still had no food at 9:30, and when we called to ask what had happened to our order, they finally admitted that the kitchen was so busy feeding other guests that the order had been ignored and not made at all. When we finally received our meal at 10:00 am, it was incomplete and nothing special. We put our room service tray outside in the hall to be picked up, and it remained there for 3 days straight. We were given two breakfast vouchers in order to make up for the misunderstanding, but when we went to the restaurant downstairs, we were seated by a waiter who seemed confused and annoyed and who put us in the back room when the front room was full of nice tables (and air conditioned). The general maintenance of the rooms was appalling and not up to the Hilton standards that we expected. We spoke with the manager (Vanetta) about our problems and she gave us connecting rooms and 30% off ONE NIGHT. It was a nice gesture, but to be honest, it wasn't at all sufficient. In our new rooms, our daughter's toilet was entirely twisted, the showers leaked all over the floor (even out into the bedroom on our first night in the new rooms). The elevators were incredibly small and slow, it became more efficient to use the stairs on almost every occasion. Just really not a good value.

I would avoid this hotel.This is one of the seemingly growing number of hotels with the lobby and check- in above the ground floor. This is fine if a hotel has good elevator or escalator access to the check-in and good security. This has neither. I waited 15 minutes just to get an elevator to enter the hotel. (With very spotty security for anyone going upstairs). This pattern of very slow elevator service, with resulting packed elevators for 30+ floors, continued for movement between floors during my stay--going to the gym (which was nice), breakfast (food ok, but so so service), or checkout. The clear and unfixable problem--the hotel simply does not have enough elevators. Fixable but a problem: if you have a car, self or valet parking is a block and a half away. I waited 40 minutes for my car to arrive, after I was told it left on its short journey.Rooms are ok--room was clean, but carpets a bit gritty and need cleaning, bathrooms lack adequate counter space.

This was my first time staying at the Doubletree FiDi, as my office has located and is right next door on Broad Street. This hotel was the most disappointing stay I've had in a long time - with a poor experience across the board, other than the great location. Starting with the positive - the hotel is in a great location, with a 5 minute walk to several subway stops connecting you to Brooklyn and uptown Manhattan. It's close to Battery Park, Wall Street and the ferries to Liberty and Statem Islands. And that's it - there is no more good. The bad. Everything you read about the lifts is true. It's absolutely ridiculous to have to wait for 20 minutes for a lift - ignore the hotel's comments, the wait isn't confined to 'busy' periods, it's all the time. Incredibly frustrating to have to wait every time you want to leave the building, so much so we found ourselves avoiding popping back into our room to freshen up or drop of bags because it would take 45 minutes to make the round trip.The hotel itself is tired dark and needs an updated. The lobby and the hallways are all dated and dark, and the hallways itself are tiny. People leave their dirty room service trays in the hallway and you need to step over them to get past, and the staff don't clean them up. One room service tray sat in the hallway for 24 hours - not great in a city with a rat problem!The room itself is tiny, and there are no amenities - no mini bar, no fridge etc. The week I was there is was 37 degrees Celsius outside, and the Doubletree doesn't provide any bottles of water, or a space to store your own water. Fairly poor for a relatively expensive hotel not to provide even a small fridge for chilled water when it's so hot. The sink is so small and the tap is so cramped I couldn't even fill up my own water bottle from the sink. All in all a shabby hotel with few redeeming qualities. The staff are generally absent and I will not be staying here again. Surprised Hilton lends it name to a hotel with so many issues - particularly when the same issues (elevators, shabby decor) are repeated time and time again in the guest review.","London, England, United Kingdom","Jacqueline S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England, United Kingdom</strong>",13,2.0

The elevators are painfully slow as well and you may have to take the stairs a lot, unless you don't mind waiting in excess of 20 minutes.

Location - Very good for business around Financial District and Wall Street. Very close to Battery Park for ferry to Liberty Island or Ellis. Right next door to the museum of Native American history etc. 3. Room Rates - Very competitive for the location. 4. Laundry Service - Outstanding! 5. Rooms - Small but functional (I was on the 30th Floor) 6. Murphy's Tavern - Next door tavern is a great option to get your brew and food. 7. Connectivity – Excellent Subway connections to anywhere in NYC and beyond Could be better: 1. Lack of in-house restaurant is a drawback. The attached Italian restaurant has good food but available only till 11:00 PM which doesn't help in a city like New York. Also, while the food they served was very good, the staff at the restaurant could have been more polite. 2. Room size - however, for the price in NYC, its still a bargain. The hotel could do with a refurbishment, though. 3. Location - Nightlife limited in that location (as expected because its in the Fin. Dist.). You have travel uptown to get more late night options. Final Thoughts – Great hotel for those with business in the area. Not recommended for tourists unless it matches their budgets. Tourists are better placed towards midtown or the Times Square (which is also pricier).","Mumbai, India","Gautam G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, India</strong>",0,5.0

The 'Bowling Green' (and Wall St) subway stop is around the corner. Chipotle Mexican restaurant is close by (if you arrive late and need a quick meal, it's good and open late) and Flavours is also around the corner (fresh, healthy food). Stone St is another excellent place, within easy walking distance for a vast array of restaurants. Don't miss the Dead Rabbit bar, also very close. Although I don't like to leave negative reviews, and there are many pluses to this hotel, it can't be ignored that the wait for the elevators in this hotel during 'peak hours' (morning and evening) is excruciating. And once you get an elevator, you stop every floor until you are crammed in with as many people as the lift will fit. I have no idea why the elevators take so long, up to 15-20 minutes! Within one day I had figured out the situation and would walk down from my 24th level hotel room most mornings rather than wait. The elevators are that bad! Also, the Hotel lost all my laundry on day 3, kept me guessing for 2 days as to where it was (assuring me every morning & evening when I called to enquire that they had it & would deliver it ""immediately"" - lucky for them I was gone most days from 7am to 11pm so it took me some time to realise what was going on). Once I figured out they had lost it, they showed ""some"" interest in helping me while I was in the USA (to be fair, there were several staff who seemed like they were genuinely trying to help - shout out to Sherman who was the nicest, most polite person I've spoken to on the phone in a long time, he was delightful to deal with and really wanted to help, but we were under time pressure as I was waiting for flights home to Aus). But once I was back in Australia, they wouldn't return emails and I haven't been able to get any return emails right up to the Assistant GM. Thank goodness for travel insurance! While clean and reasonably priced and the staff friendly, if I were to return on a business trip, I would be asking to stay elsewhere. The elevators were just too frustrating, and I don't agree with rewarding a hotel with return business given their approach to fixing a problem (ie the lost laundry). If you do decide to stay (and besides the elevators and my own unique problem with the laundry) it was fine - don't use the laundry service and request to stay on the lower levels where you can use the stairs to get in and out of the hotel.","Sydney, Australia","RStips</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",2,3.0

We realized the carpet was soaking wet - the A/C was leaking! That was it; I called the front desk at 3:00 am. They sent someone to come fix it. The next morning, I politely explained our whole experience to a different front desk representative. She said that in terms of compensation, she sees that we were given breakfast passes for the first night stay. For the second night stay, she could give us 30% off. We calmly agreed. But honestly - I was never given an option to choose breakfast OR a discount on my first night stay. I would definitely rather have that. I can get a cheap breakfast anywhere after having to share a double size bed with my boyfriend. I left a comment card explaining how dissatisfied and upset I was. Have I heard back? Nope! It's been two weeks. I am never returning here again. I've told all my friends and family about this place, and I will always remember it. The reviews on Booking Buddy for this place were great, so I was excited. They were wrong. Do NOT book this hotel.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","CristinaMichelle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",1,1.0

There are something like 45 floors and only 4 elevators. If you are on a mid-level floor, be prepared to wait up to 15-20 minutes for an elevator in the morning. Guests from higher floors (particularly those checking out) cram the tiny elevators, and they tend to be full by the time they get to the lower levels. Tip: pick a lower floor (guest rooms start on 4) unless you want to be frustrated with waiting for an elevator every time you want to enter or leave the hotel.3) Hilton's Hhonors program allows you to pre-check in and choose your room, but this invalidates you from getting an upgrade. The front desk will give you a hard time if you ask for an upgrade and you've already checked in. The only time I received an upgrade was when I forgot to check in on the internet and got lucky. Per #2, I'm not willing to be stuck on the 35th floor so I just deal with having a tiny room of my choice.Now, about the hotel itself:1) Desperately in need of a facelift in the common areas. The carpet is tired and coming up off the floor near the walls. Shelves in the halls are falling off the wall. Ice machine is broken on the 4th floor as of June 2016. Nearest ice is the 7th floor.2) The halls are *very* narrow. I've seen people really struggling to roll full size luggage around3) Rooms are smaller than average (the Hampton Inn just around the corner is much roomier), and the shower stalls are so small that if you are a large person you will really have a hard time.4) The rooms also desperately need a facelift. My bathroom sink is cracked (a hairline crack along the entire basin), the toilet doesn't flush properly, and several light fixtures don't work.Overall, the only reason I stay here is because it is close to my office and I want to get Hilton points. I'd never spend my own money at this hotel.","Charlottesville, Virginia","jasonh590</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charlottesville, Virginia</strong>",30,2.0

Elevators. Depending on when you leave and return each day, the elevators may or may not be an issue. When I left before 8am, I only had stops at a few floors on the way down. I was on floor 34. No issues. BUT if you are using the elevators to get down around mid-morning or weekends, prepare for long rides. You almost stop at every floor. I did not time it but it felt like over 5 minutes on the elevator. Some folks ride up just so that they can get room on the elevator on the ride down. The reviews are true that they can be really bad depending on the time of day. Get a LOW floor so you can take the stairs. Really.Location - was great b/c I had a course a few blocks away. There are a lot of restaurants and bars nearby but breakfast places can be closed on the weekends. The Seaport area is a short walk and it has a lot of restaurants and shops. Really neat area. Subway is near the hotel and easy to figure out. Our cab ride from LGA was about 60 bucks with tip. We took a limo on the return trip and that was 41 with tip.Room - was clean and nice. Small but that is NYC. There is no breakfast or coffee/tea in the lobby. You are on your own. There is a restaurant right off the elevators which seemed busy for breakfast. There is a Le Pain Quotidien a block away which is a great breakfast place. You can get a small refrigerator delivered to the room if available. They are free. No microwaves in room.Would I stay again? Yes, but there was a Conrad nearby that was about the same rate if you like the Hilton chain.","Dubuque, Iowa","ccpr20</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubuque, Iowa</strong>",31,4.0

The manner in which the guest is ”accommodated” can often make the difference between a slightly annoying experience or a truly MISERABLE one. We were that 441st guest on Saturday night the 11th, after a long day on the road, but the experience at this Doubletree was singularly the worst, most incompetent treatment we have ever received at the hands of a hotel. We attribute this experience, not to the poor, beleaguered, desk clerk, but rather to the poor training (any?) that she had received in preparing for what must not be an uncommon overbooking situation (at least from a review I have read from earlier this week of the same hotel!). According to the “folio” we subsequently received by email, we arrived at 11:36 (in fact, it was more like 11:15, but the single desk clerk’s delay in greeting us (she was under the weather, and was, in truth trying to power through her cough) wasted close to 20 minutes. The reservation system was balky, but finally recognized our reservation number. We were finally assigned a room, and with the obligatory offer of chocolate chip cookies, we ascended the elevator to find, upon entering the room that it was already occupied! We felt terrible for the people whose rest we disturbed, and quickly retreated, with apologies. One might think that similar apologies might have followed FROM the desk clerk, but instead, when we returned to the reception desk, we received nothing more than a wide-eyed stare, followed by a silent retreat, into the “administrative office.” Nothing more for 10 minutes, when a young man emerged from another door, with no further information----we had to retell the story of having barged into the already-occupied room. Then HE retreated to the administrative office, finally (another 8 – 10 minutes) emerging to inform us, matter of factly, that there were no available rooms, and that they would instead walk us over to another hotel in the Hilton chain, the Hampton Inn, about 5 minutes away, and that we would “be called by his manager” the next day. NO meaningful apology, nothing to acknowledge that our own discomfort---never mind that of the people whose room we had “invaded,” was the least bit out of the ordinary. Short story: We reached the Hampton on our own steam, they were absolutely fine, and we finally got some sleep. But the experience at the Doubletree will discourage us from dealing wIth Hilton ever again---despite the fact that we are “Hilton Rewards” members. Final points: The “folio” showed that we departed at 12:13 AM. Close to 40 minutes of chaos and inconvenience. And, oh, by the way, no call from the “manager.”","Boston, Massachusetts","Lawrence B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",3,1.0

Overall enjoyed my stay with a few minor exceptions. I had paid a little extra for a room with a ""city view"" and was given a room on the 44th floor but the view was of Brooklyn and not the Manhattan view I was expecting. The room was quite comfortable and clean and a good size for NYC. There was a bit of hallway noise from doors slamming and the ice machine but not too bad. I compensated for that by turning on the fan of the ac unit which blocked out much of the noise. A nice tip: the hotel provides a free refrigerator if you ask for it at check in. One of the gripes many people have is the slow elevators. Have to say this wasn't a huge issue although I did notice many of the staff using the same elevators to ride up or down a floor or two. There is lots to do in the FiDi with plenty of restaurants and attractions nearby and the R train stop on the corner.

I used to live in NYC, and recently moved to a different state, but I keep going to the city to visit friends and places. This time I wanted to go alone with my 2-year old and stay at a hotel in Manhattan instead of at my friends' places in Brooklyn. I mention that because the location of this hotel is perfect if you are going to be visiting both boros. The hotel doesn't have a garage, which in Manhattan is a bit of an issue, but they do have a special rate at a garage in the next block, the Icon. Even with the discount, it was pricey, especially because my large SUV had a whooping $40 per night supplement... city things that I do not miss... what can we do. At least it was discounted. The lobby was nice, not very large, but again, lower Manhattan is like this, the rooms though are nice. We were in a beautiful room on the 36th floor, with a fantastic window facing the new Freedom Tower. We got there late friday night, and my son was so excited looking out the window, he was looking down at the tiny people and tiny cars, up at the beautiful lit-up tower... I can imagine for a tourist, this view is worth a million dollars, it is 100% what we all want to see when we go to NYC. Now, I called twice to make sure I could get a bathtub, they told me my room would have a bathtub, and for me that was kind of important because my little one doesn't love showers, he prefers a bath. Well, the room did not have a bathtub, but the shower was really big and he could be as in or as out the water as he wanted. Most people won't be affected by that point, but it is the fact that I called twice to make sure. Anyway, it worked out, it was just 3 days. The staff was super nice, helped me around with the stroller, the bags, in the rain... and when we left, the bellboy whispered to me ""Can I give him a cookie?"" and I nodded smiling, he went running to a back room and came back with half a dozen cookies ""for our trip"" so nice, such a nice little thing to do. The location is super convenient, we woke up early on saturday and just 1 block down the street we took to the free ferry to Staten Island, which takes you next to the Statue of Liberty and then the view when you are returning and are approaching the city from the bottom, is like woah.

It's right by Wall Street, 15 min walk to the 9/11 Memorial, close to the Staten Island ferry, 10 min walk to Brooklyn Bridge and you've got great subway access. They also give you nice warm cookies at check in. That just about sums up the good stuff. This is one of those in and out hotels. It really offers no additional incentives to guests. Zero glitz. Just a room and a shower. The hotel rooms (for a King) are tiny. The hallways are veeery tiny. The bathroom is an ok size, but I couldn't get the water to stop leaking through the glass doors. I ended up having to shower pressed up against the wall so that the water wouldn't puddle on the bathroom floor. the base for the shower nob rotated, like it wasn't installed properly. The carpet seemed a bit moist to me - maybe it was a bit humid? The bed was comfy, but there were flies in the room. Tiny ones, maybe a bit bigger than fruit flies. Again, maybe because of the humidity. Our last full day there, the AC gave out. Only the fan worked. we called to get it looked at and when we got back from dinner, everything was the same. We called again and were told that it was probably the compressor and that they could switch us to another room. They did, and it was nice and cool - but it smelled some. and that AC looked as if someone had let their frustration out on it... I didn't have a problem with the front desk at all. everyone was pleasant. However, when we got there, two people were in line complaining about their rooms. One of those guests got a bit snippy with the receptionist and she told the lady that she'd be with her in a minute but she kind of lost her temper and rolled her eyes visibly and in front of everyone at the guest (I mean I get it, but if you're in the hospitality field, you need to keep that in check, or private). We had arrived too early to check in so we left our bags with the bellman. When we returned, the bags were unattended. on the group floor. and we stood there for about 5 min. until someone showed up(a different bellman). We could see our bags and contemplated just grabbing them ourselves. I thought it was horrible that all of these suitcases were just left there, by the door, for anyone to grab. Every morning and afternoon there was this tray of used plates on the floor by the elevator doors. not moved. at all. i pointed it out the morning after we arrived and another guest told me that he'd seen it there since two days before. Maybe they were new plates each day, but it made me wonder ... We knew about the elevators ahead of time, per the reviews, and we had decided that it wasn't a deal breaker. it's not horrible unless you're in a hurry. at least two were working and we didn't mind waiting too much - until we were late, but when we planned ahead we were ok. The view itself wasn't good. Construction in between buildings. So if you go, you basically only go for a place to shower and sleep. I guess it served our purpose, but if I'd do it again, I wouldn't stay here. and I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. I'd much rather have paid the extra $30-$50 and stayed elsewhere","Chicago, Illinois","MariRdgz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",8,2.0

The shower room is tiny such that if you start showering while facing the front, you cannot turn until you are done. If you happen to drop your soap, you have to stop the shower open the door to get sufficient room to pick it up. The bed was very comfortable, especially after a day of walking around Manhattan, nothing could be better for the body and soul. The staff were good to deliver the service and nothing more. Maybe that's just how it is in New York but being an East African and experienced the hospitality of the likes of Double Tree By Hilton at Stone town Zanzibar, this was below par.We were tourists and from the hotel it was a walking distance to wall street and everything financial about New York.

The insulation in the building is not that good, so you can hear toilet flushing, guests taking showers, etc. The breakfast was given at the adjacent Italian restaurant on the first floor, and the staff was also rude (or inexperienced). The waiter would pour already coffee in your cup even before asking if you wanted any. I was also suffering from a foot injury with a cast and walking with a cane, and as the staff seemed busy doing nothing or figuring out what to do when we walked in. I took the initiative to take table in the back where I could seat down. A waiter asked me to stand up again and to take a different table since this one was already reserved! I found out from other guests (met in the elevator) who were seated next to it that this wasn't true and the table was still available even after they leaved! This hotel gets overcrowded with tourists and we had sometimes to wait a good 15 minutes to get into the elevators.

This hotel is old ... tired. There are three small elevators and they are not adequate to handle the number of people especially at busy times like 8 a.m. when the packed full elevator opened on every floor but no one else could get in because it was so full. It made for a very long descent. When I first went to my room, I realized it was directly across from the elevators ... very directly across ... like 4 feet from the door of my room, you'd be standing in the elevator. Too close! If the elevator door was open and my room door was opened, strangers in the elevator would be looking fit into my room. Plus I was concerned about the noise. So I went back to the front desk to ask for a different room. But apparently there were only rooms on other floors across from the elevators on other floors. Nothing else. It wasn't even that late, 8 pm, when I checked in. (Try to avoid rooms ending in 03 or 04.)The bathroom in my hotel room appeared to have been updated (large overhead shower head in a shower with glass doors); but the new sink was very impractical because it took up too much room and didn't leave much space for any of my toiletries etc. Also, two of the pillows in my room had stains on them (see photo).

Pro - the restaurant also does the breakfast for hilton honors statused guests. Decent eggs bacon sausage coffee juice - nice spread3. Con - elevators - there are 40+ floors and maybe 10 rooms per floor - and three elevators...long wait times during rush hour...I don't recommend staying on the 10th floor - the first day I noticed that every time I pushed the button to go down I got an elevator going up...I had to push the up to go down...I reported it and by the second day I finally gave in and pushed the up button when I wanted to go down4. Con - very small bathroom and the lighting wasn't so good for makeup - the bathroom door is a barn door sliding style - good for a small place - but there was no hook(s) for towels in the bathroom...that was very annoying5. Con - the blow dryer in my bathroom was missing - nothing like waiting for a blow dryer when your hair is wet and you need to get to work6.

Typically I'm a big fan of all Hilton brands, but this one was just ok. My issue was mostly with the property itself as opposed to the staff I encountered. The staff is very friendly and attentive so if you're looking for great customer service, this hotel gets an A+ in that department. The only reason why we stayed at this particular location is because it was the cheapest given the nights we chose and once in New York City, it's very easy to get around. However, I somewhat regret the location because the Financial District in general, particularly at night is extremely desolate and nothing is open. In walking distance from several subway lines, (4,5,J,Z and R), I think hotel is better suited for persons traveling on business. Definitely not pleasure. Literally the most annoying part about this location is that you will not find a parking space. Being a native New Yorker, and having an understanding that using a car in NYC is more like a liability, most, if not all the parking near this hotel is reserved for commercial vehicles. Although parking garages are available nearby, you're going to be paying out big bucks to park your car and depending on the size of your vehicle, you may be charged an additional fee. The rate at the garages is approximately $60 per day, but the hotel validates parking (YOU MUST ASK) for which you receive a $20 discount. Hotel Itself: Despite the aforementioned, this seems to be a very popular hotel. They have over 30 floors, but the building is narrow. Although the rooms are nice, they are small and whatever you do, do not choose a room that's directly in front of the elevator. There is literally 2 feet between your room and the elevator door. What I also don't like is that the Front desk is located on the second floor, so when you actually get into the hotel, you need to hop on the elevator just to get to the reception area and as you can imagine, given the number of floors, the elevator can be slow. We ended up walking down the stairs on numerous occasions, thankfully we were only on the 9th floor. What I did appreciate: Fresh cookies every morning at the front desk. The staff Providing us with a later check out time, which we greatly appreciated. Although I wrote plenty of negatives, it was a pretty good experience. If you're looking for entertainment constantly, seek a Hilton brand uptown because you may be disappointed solely due to the hotels location.","New York City, New York","Krystal C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",5,3.0

I placed the “request upon arrival” order. I had hoped to surprise my fiancee with the champagne on arrival, but it was not delivered. I called the front desk and was redirected to the restaurant. The restaurant employee was dismissive and insulting stating that they “could never give me wine at that price.” I spoke with the front desk in-person and was promised a resolution. No resolution was actually reached—they never even addressed the issue. The elevators in the building are intolerably slow. We found it necessary to build 10-15 minutes into our travel plans throughout the weekend stay in order to accommodate the wait for the elevators. In addition, the elevators do not properly account for whether a person is heading up or down, so they open on the wrong direction of travel. On one day, we were in the room much of the morning but leaving at approximately 11:45AM. When the housekeeper came by at 11:30AM, we asked that she come back in 30 minutes or so. She never returned and our room was never cleaned. On our last morning, we were jerked to sleep at about 8AM to the sound of wallpaper and baseboard being ripped from the hallway walls as the workers performing the work yelled at each other. We had hoped to sleep much longer as we had a long day of travel ahead and my fiancee was ill. The noise proceeded all morning until we left at 1PM. As we left, the hallway was quite dusty and wires protruded from the hallway walls.

We chose the Hilton Doubletree hotel on Stone Street because of it's convenient location. The best thing about this hotel was the staff, especially Tony, Allen, Luis and Hopton at the front door. We also appreciated the assistance given to us by Kelliani, Damian, Venetta, Cindy and Valerie at the front desk. Everyone always provided service with a smile, no matter what we needed or what time of day it was. Additionally the housekeeping staff was excellent, always responding promptly when we needed our room cleaned. This was important because my husband was working long hours in the room, so getting it cleaned every day on our schedule was a must. The restaurant on the first floor has very good food and excellent service. This was also important because although we did eat at neighborhood restaurants occasionally, we often just opted for a quick bite downstairs because we needed to get back to work. Our room was on the 42nd floor and had a great view. We were grateful for this because we spent so much time in it, That said, we often had to wait many minutes for an elevator to get downstairs and that was a bit of a drawback because the three elevators were a bit slow and required patience. The hotel itself could use some remodeling, especially the hallways and the elevators. The room was adequate in size. The shower had a great shower head but the shower door leaked. It wasn't a big problem as long as we didn't take showers that were too long. There was a fitness room on the third floor that I used frequently that was well equipped and of a decent size and this was a big plus for me. Another big plus was that the hotel was quiet. Noise was never an issue. Also, although it is located on a small, quiet street the hotel is within walking distance of a variety of restaurants, taverns, cafes and shopping.

As a fellow Hilton employee, a Hilton Honors member, and beyond that a GUEST, I was extremely disappointed with how the staff treated me. To begin with, out of the several interactions I had with your employees there were only two that greeted me with a smile and made me feel welcome. The front desk agent, Charnice Mohammed, and a house keeper whose name I was unable to obtain. I understand that your hotel is large and is located in New York City - an area not exactly known for its hospitality and friendliness. Unfortunately, this is a Hilton hotel and hospitality is the name of our game. Beyond this, it consistently took over five minutes for any front desk agent to pick up when I called. I know this because I began timing the calls after the first time it happened. On this same note, three different times throughout the day I called to request red wine glasses be delivered to my room while I was out seeing the city. The first time the agent failed to get my room number and hung up on me. The second time I was transferred to the restaurant who seemed hurried, which I understand. To verify that the glasses had brought up to the room I called a third time, where I was told that the glasses had not been delivered and would be. Mind you, each of these one minute calls took five plus minutes due to the delay in answering the phone. Upon my arrival later that night after several hours of walking, I had found the glasses had indeed - not been delivered. At this point I decided that it would be best for me to get them myself and so I went down to the restaurant. Now, I am going to write this in a separate paragraph because this, by far, was the worst experience of the entire trip. Upon arriving to the restaurant I went up to a gentleman and told him I was a guest in the hotel and I would like two red wine glasses. His response was ""Where are your keycards?"" Fair question. I showed the gentleman my key cards and his response was ""What is your room number?"" This is where I began to get annoyed. I had showed him my key packet/key cards. Read it. So I gave him my room number. He goes behind the bar and asks again ""What did you need?"" Two red wine glasses. ""What is your room number?"" You see where I am going with this. At this point only minor irritation but what happened next definitely escalated the situation. The gentleman proceeded to hand me two water goblets and said the following ""If you do not return these in the morning I will personally make sure that you will be charged $20 per glass."" Let me stress that he handed me two water goblets - I have my degree in Winery Management and have undergone several hours of sommelier training - I know the difference between a Riedel crystal burgundy and water goblets. As minute as this sounds it was extremely insulting for him to assume I would not know the difference. Speaking of assumptions, for him to even comment that he would charge me for the glasses implies that I would steal them. To backhandedly call a guest a thief - I am speechless. I am almost positive that The Double Tree of the Financial District of New York City is not financially hurting enough for this comment to be made. As for the last part of his comment, that I would need to hand deliver them to the bar in the morning. I drove six hours to get to Manhattan. I walked for six plus hours to see the city. The last thing I wanted was a chore. As far as I know, housekeeping is responsible for returning glass ware/plates/etc. to the restaurant - room service. After returning to my room and waiting five more minutes for the front desk to answer I refused to waste my time talking to anyone else but Charnice Mohammed as she was literally the shining star of my trip. Later around midnight, I received several phone calls while I was asleep. Eventually I unplugged my phone because it just would not stop. In the morning I found that it was the front desk trying to service recover me with a $50 voucher for breakfast and a free bottle of wine - a note under the door would have sufficed. To sum up, it is my opinion that the gentleman in the bar is in severe need of several more hours of training on Hilton Cares or should not be in the hospitality business and should find work elsewhere. I am a Night Auditor/Front Desk Representative/Manager on Duty. I am proud of this company and am dedicated to its promise, but I walked away from this hotel ashamed that it is part of our family. You have a beautiful property where you have the luxury of meeting hundreds of people per day to show them that Hilton is far superior to other brands when it comes to getting it right - I only wish 99% of your staff could see this opportunity and embrace it.","Watertown, United States","Jacob S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Watertown, United States</strong>",1,1.0

It included breakfast. Receptionist demanded travel paperwork which we did. Our paperwork showed an ""American Breakfast"" but she stated she didn't know what that meant; it was our problem for going through a third party (they are the ones with contract) and we could be lying and trying to get a free breakfast. We had not bothered with breakfast for the first morning so we had even skipped a free breakfast at the hotel. Manager came in and when we looked to him he rolled his eyes and stated he had ""just walked in."" Well after much frustration (this went on for an exhaustive 45 minutes) he relented after yelling at the travel agent I had called to clear it up! We called Hilton headquarters and a few minutes later we got a call on the hotel phone from an apologetic manager. By then hubby decided hotel not a good place. We got a room at the Belvedere.

The showers are trendy clear glass, and they look nice, but you'll have a puddle of water on the floor when you're done. Second, since it's a 44-story building, you can be hard-pressed to catch an elevator in the morning. If you're on the first ten floors, you're probably better off walking down the stairs. If you're above that, make sure you allot 15 minutes to catch an elevator.

The leisure bit included the slight distraction of running in the NYC Marathon on Nov. 1. The reason I booked this hotel was because of it's proximity to the Staten Island Ferry which takes one across to the Staten Island start point of the Marathon. It was also the most reasonably priced of the 3 or 4 star hotel available in Lower and Midtown Manhattan. I realised afterwards about the complaints about the elevators (lifts in my part of the world) being slow but still took the risk. It is not as bad as many reviewers say. I went up and down to the 20th floor where my room was many times a day and the only part of the day when it was slow was between 8am to 9.30am - but even then it was tolerable - maybe 5min to get down or up. It's not the worst I've experienced in my travels. So what else is good about the hotel. The location is fantastic for visiting Liberty Island and Wall Street area and downtown Manhattan. There are about 4 subway stations within reasonable walking distance and we had no problem getting to Times Square and other parts of NYC from the hotel. The Whitehall Station (yellow line, R train) is like 50 metres away. The floor plate is small, there are only 10 rooms per floor - it's good because it offers privacy. Nothing much to complain about the hotel and service. Staff were friendly and helpful - especially the staff who were stationed on the ground floor to welcome guests (reception is on the second floor). I even got an extra warm cookie for my better half who arrived later. An iron and ironing board was provided in the closet. Everything was up to the mark. I'm surprised at the poor TA ranking of this hotel. Small issues and minor inconveniences that one might consider when booking this hotel. The room is small. I think it was no more than 200 sq feet so quite cramp but there's enough storage area for us - and we had 3 large suitcases. The shower is fine with enough water pressure but the cubicle design is such that water seeps into the toilet floor. There is no mini-bar - not in the room I was in which was the King Room. There was no view from my room but I understand the upper floors might be better but you would have to pay more.","Singapore, Singapore","Shrek-loves-Fiona</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",152,4.0

The end tables were about 12 inches wide and just enough room to get into bed on one side. On the window side of the room there was a little more room. At the foot of the bed was a dresser/tvstand/coffee counter (all in one) were there was just enough room to pass between the dresser and the foot of the bed. I like a nice big room.

I walked down the four floors to the lobby on the second floor. There was a line of six people checking into the hotel. The check in process takes several minutes.

I travel for work. I stay in over 100 hotels annually and over 1,000 in total so far. I've stayed in everything from the highest end hotels, to boutiques and mid level chains. I've seen the gamut and have pretty realistic expectations of what to expect from a property.I chose this hotel solely based upon its location in the city. I needed to be on wall street for work, and chose this property because it was within walking distance. If you're looking at this hotel, it would only be specifically because of it's location. It is close to the twin tower site and battery park, but not much else you'd want to see in the city. The rooms are very small, and the bathrooms even smaller. It made a multiple night stay feel very claustrophobic. Forget two people trying to share this bathroom, that won't happen! The hotel is very tall, 45 floors or so. The entire property is services with only 3 elevators, so prepare to wait anytime you want to use one, and stop at a lot of floors. At one point it took me 10 minutes to get from my room to the lobby. The one thing that annoyed me was the air conditioning unit in the room. NYC is noisy, and I like to keep the AC units fan on to help drowned out the noise of the city. Unfortunately, these units can't do this and they are loud, so I was either kept up by the sounds of the city, or awoken by the AC unit turning on and off all night. It didn't make for a great nights of sleep. The room was clean, and well maintained.

The staff was friendly, and the beds were comfortable. The rooms and hallways are definitely on the small side, but it's about what I'd expect for Manhattan.A couple of things prevent this place from getting 5 stars:- The elevators are slow. When you've got 44 floors, 3 elevators just doesn't cut it, especially when they're slow. The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that the lobby is on the 2nd floor, so you wait forever for an elevator because people are taking them from the ground floor to the second floor and back down.- The king beds are not quite king size. They're about 4"" short. Didn't bother us too much, since you can sleep a little diagonal, but it is noticeable.- They don't have any automated check-out, either on TV or on the phone. Despite receiving a statement under my door on my last night (and having a credit card on file), the desk staffer on the phone said I had to go down to the front desk to turn in my keys. I hope it was just a miscommunication.Now there's a lot to like about this hotel, including the price, and the views from the upper floors on the Hudson side. The doors, windows, and walls are very soundproofed -- we did not hear our neighbors at all, nor did we hear much traffic noise.

The lobby is on the 2nd floor, so you must take the elevator up, which is the first hurdle. There are three tiny elevators in all, and all are mighty slow to arrive! We could tell that the staff was very embarrassed by this problem, and did all they could to help guests maneuver. There are only 5 or 6 rooms on each floor. Each very small but pretty well thought out to maximize space.The bathrooms do need a bit getting used to. The faucet at the sink is easily bumped, and friend staying here had the faucet pop right off, causing water to spray all over. There is one tiny towel bar, and no space for a tissue box. The shower was nice, but the GRAB BAR is too far away from the shower head so you can't hold on, and the soap shelf is also at the opposite end of the shower. That is not the fault of the hotel, but of its designers, but Doubletree needs to know that!Checkout was smooth; there was a minor issue with one of the folios, but staff took care of it smoothly and immediately.

Unfortunately, that didn't help; elevator service was so slow that it wasn't uncommon to wait 3-5 minutes for one to arrive. Once it did arrive, we had about a 50/50 chance of it being full of passengers already.This is especially bad when entering the hotel: since the lobby is one floor above the entrance, it wasn't uncommon for guests to hop on the down elevator when they wanted to go up. This meant that you could either spend 10-15 minutes waiting for a second or third elevator, or walk up a few dozen flights of stairs to your room.Making matters worse, on both days of our stay, busloads of tourists were checking in and out. The entryway and lobby were filled with suitcases and/or lines of people waiting for the elevators. Be prepared to take the stairs at every available opportunity.Did I mention that all three elevators were in service?The room size was typical for a NYC hotel. However, the room itself was worn out. Light fixtures were bent / dirty / burnt out, the TV didn't have any HDMI inputs (seriously -- it's 2015), the clock was completely dead, and the overall impression was really underwhelming. I could forgive all of this if this were a 2-star hotel or we got a major discount, but this is a four-star hotel, and not a cheap one at that.The only pros of the hotel are its location and the fact that it was very clean. There's a lot of restaurants and bars about one block east on Stone Street. However, you can find much better hotels nearby at the same or lower prices.

While they can't retrofit the hotel, they should invest in technology to better manage the lifts as other hotels do in NYC with limited lifts. Second, they assigned someone else to my room while I was in it, not fun having someone walking into your room late at night. They didn't apologize until check out, when I brought it up.

The rooms are VERY small and there are some significant issues with the elevators (wait times in excess of 20 min). The Hotel staff on the other hand are outstanding, providing kind, courteous and responsive attention to Hotel guests.The Hotel restaurant on the other hand treats guests terribly. After returning from a long day in the City, my wife and I ordered takeout from one of of favorite restaurants in NYC. Upon returning to the room I called down to room service to ask for two sets of plates and silverware. I was unkindly told by the onsite restaurant personnel that I would need to come down to the first floor in order to pick up these items. I was so excited that I declined to wait the requisite 20 min for the elevator and RAN down 35 flights of stairs so I could commence my romantic night with my wife. When I reached the restaurant I was given two sets of plastic flatware. When I inquired as to the availability of actual silverware and dishes, I was informed by the restaurant manager that this was impossible because he could not track them (WHAT?!?). He told me he was only capable of tracking items provided as part of Room Service and not dishes/silverware provided to guests. This still makes no sense to me since he could easily have provided the items via room service, just without the food. After significant discussion he finally allowed me to leave with 2 dishes under the condition that I physically bring them back that night. I eventually got back to the room (after the normal elevator wait) and showed my wife the mediocre victory I had achieved. She was irate, not only with the fact that I was down in the restaurant arguing with their staff for 30 min, but with quality of service we had been given. She called down to restaurant manager and expressed her complete disappointment with his service (we were offered free breakfast for our stay, but declined). It was after this discussion with my wife that the restaurant manager, apparently fearing complaints, finally offered to bring dishes and silverware to us.The moral of the story is that there are a number of hotels in the area that provide a much better experience to their guests. Until such time as the restaurant staff realize that we are PAYING to be here and treats guests properly, I would stay somewhere else.","New York City, New York","Danny_Nelson529</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,2.0

When we arrived we didn't get the best service as I said my name and then the receptionist disappeared. As we had been on a long haul flight and it was gone 10pm it seemed like she disappeared for ages. In the end we had to ask her colleague where she had gone. The problem was my credit card I booked with had expired so they needed a new one but it would have been good to be told this rather than hanging around at reception for 15 minutes with no idea what had happened. Then there was no king size rooms available so we ended up in a twin double - we had to wait for this room to be got ready. We were given a room on the 4th floor despite asking for a high floor as there was no other rooms available. However, this was great as we could easily walk to here and not have to get the lifts. There was a few problems with the room like the toilet roll holder had fallen off and a few things were missing but these were quickly rectified. We were very impressed with the maid our room was very well maintained. We thought the location was great - we arrived into Newark and got the NJ transit to Penn Station and then got the red subway line to Wall Street stop which was under a 10 minute walk. The hotel was on the same street as the yellow line with stop Whitehall street on the same street as the hotel. Also Bowling Green on the green line was just around the corner. This meant no matter where we were going we rarely had to change lines.

My business trip was last minute and on a holiday week that also happened to include 9/11 making room availability in lower Manhattan scarce. The only room I could reserve was handicap accessible which I HATE. Before starting my review I want to compliment the Front desk who was able to find a non-handicap accessible room when I checked in. The Good: Cooperative front desk staff, attentive doorman, comfortable beds, plenty of plugs for electronics, somewhat updated accommodations, I could use my iPad to stream HBOgo with no issues. The Bad: Little help from their ""Care Line"". A significant amount of Water was making it out of the shower to the bathroom floor. Called the Care-Line but nothing was done. Filthy vent in bathroom blowing out dust bunnies. Called the Care-Line, nothing was done. As a Diamond member eligible for a free breakfast buffet very disappointed that there was literally no seating available in the restaurant each morning. The tv channel guide was outdated. Called the Care-Line, no new guide provided. Extremely long elevator wait. Compared to other Hilton stays, this one was a little below average but maybe this was bad timing? I think I may need to stay here again and update this review to see if the issues remain.","Salt Lake City, Utah","tmjones467</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salt Lake City, Utah</strong>",1,3.0

He was the bellhop/valet attendant/cab caller/ elevator director (not sure how many other jobs he had either). He was great. He took our bags and our car and then told us we could go up to the lobby to check in or have breakfast in the restaurant. We opted to go up and see if checking in was an option (which it wasn't yet - but that was ok it was before 9AM). The young lady at the front desk told us that we could leave our bags downstairs, which we did. I saw her offer the man in front of us a voucher for breakfast in the restaurant downstairs, but figured we didn't get one because we hadn't checked in. We ended up eating downstairs in the restaurant and paying for our breakfast. Morale of this story is - ask for your breakfast voucher or whatever.The next day we were checking out. We left our hotel room at 10:00am and stood in the hallway waiting for the elevator to go down for 30 minutes. My boyfriend and my sister's boyfriend ended up walking down the stairs to try to see if they could catch the elevator up to the 19th floor to get us. We would have also walked, but my sister is disabled (lung disease) and could not really make it down all the stairs without getting winded. The guys called us from the lobby and told us that one of the elevators was out and there was a long line of people trying to get upstairs. Against our will, we had to take the long walk down to the 2nd floor from the 19th floor (thank God for oxygen tanks). We made it to the second floor, checked out, and then proceeded to the lobby to get the car from the valet (which we waited 20 minutes for as well). Once we left, i received an email from my bank for and extra $110 charge from the hotel. When I called, I inquired about the charge and was told that the car was parked in the valet for an additional 30 minutes and they charged us for another day. I do not really find it far to be charged a whole day for parking when we waited 30 minutes for the elevator and 20 more for the car to be brought around.","Amityville, New York","MsTrinaWill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amityville, New York</strong>",8,3.0

The room was for my best friend's bachelorette party whose wedding I am a bridesmaid in. A week prior to the reservation, I called the hotel to inquire about checking in earlier than the standard check in at 3 PM since we had a lot to prepare for the evening and several people coming from out of town. When I called, I was told early check-in is not guaranteed until the day of check-in but to call the morning of the reservation and see what the likelihood was of getting in early. When I called the hotel at around 11:30 in the morning on the day of my reservation, I was greeted by an extremely rude front desk person who said, ""Let me explain something to you, I don't know WHO you spoke with here or who told you to call, but we do not confirm early check-in over the phone. You would have to be here and in the lobby for me to check you in early...""After basically being yelled at by this woman, I decided against heading downtown early and decided to just wait until the standard check-in time at 3 PM. I arrived at the hotel at almost 3:30 due to some traffic getting in to the area. When I got to the front desk, I was told that my double room was not ready yet. This sent me into a complete panic because I had people arriving soon to begin the evening and who needed to get ready, not to mention the bride coming in 2 hours. I explained to management that I needed to know if the wait would be 15 min or much longer and that I actually called the morning of the reservation asking to get in early. The front desk person then proceeded to call and page housekeeping 5 times without any answer. The manager came over and said, he was just awaiting confirmation from housekeeping if the rooms were ready or when they would be ready...I'm still not sure what kept him from just going up to check the room himself. After standing in the lobby for about 30 minutes waiting on some kind of confirmation or ETA on when I could get in, I'd had enough and said I needed to be in a room very soon or my evening was going to be ruined. The manager then explained he could put me into a room, however something in the shower was broken and they would have to send a maintenance man to come work in the room while we were in there, or we would not have an operating shower. Great.The manager brought me up to the room and said a maintenance person would be up shortly to repair something in the shower. This was at 4:00 PM, a full hour after standard check-in and technically, the room still wasn't ready. 5 minutes later, the maintenance person arrived and asked me what needed to be fixed...I had no idea, having just gotten into the room myself, I thought for sure someone would have told him what he needed to fix. He then called the manager from the room's phone and I had to listen to the manager on speaker phone berate the maintenance man for walking into a room and not knowing what to fix. Awkward. The maintenance person was in there about 5-10 minutes and then left, thank goodness. I still have no idea what was broken or if it was even fixed.The only thing I was offered as consolation for this entire mess was a free breakfast voucher and that was AFTER, I had to ask to be compensated. Nothing was actually offered to me without provocation.Throughout the whole weekend, whenever we called the front desk to ask for anything, we were treated poorly and I was only given one room key upon check-in. To top off everything, there were little gnats flying all around the room and since there were only 3 elevators servicing all 40+ floors of the hotel, we spent a significant amount of time waiting to even get downstairs. Over all, I'm just glad we were only there for one evening. I will never be back to this place.

The hotel has many positives: - It's location. This hotel is somewhat out of the way of the real hustle and bustle of New York but in a nice and easy commutable distance. There is a subway station at the end of the road and is only 15 minutes to Boadway/ Times square. There is also some good tourist attractions close by such as 1WTC, Staten Island Ferry just around the corner and also Wall Street. There is also a really nice pub next door which can get busy with a decent child out atmosphere of an evening. - Rooms. The rooms are very good value for money compares to other hotels in New York City. They are clean, a good size and if you can get a room at the top (pending you're not scared of heights) there are some great views of the Hudson or the 1WTC. The rooms also had a good choice of TV channels - Fast WIFI! A real bonus - Porters are really helpful with cases and other baggage (don't forget to tip) On a negative note: - Cleaners. hmm now a lot people state how Americans can be a bit 'peeved' if you do not tip them if they are offering you a service. being British we don't have this cultural problem. Throughout my trip i gather a lot of coin change, which i was chucking in my bedside table.... on one afternoon i returned to see that all the change had been taken... now it was only $7/8 if that... but in Britain, we'd say that if you are not given something... to take it, it is called stealing. -front desk staff. at times the staff can be really abrupt and rude. we made our booking through booking.com... on our booking the price was clear... when we arrived at the hotel after travelling for near 20 hours the front desk staff told us we also had to put down a cash deposit of $50pppn.... now we did not have this (although we had the full cost of the hotel) the clerk argued with us for a good 40 minutes. he advised that he would 'check' with his supervisor if we could continue to stay....a real lack of customer service! - THE LIFTS. Grr having 1 lifts for a hotel with 46 floors (the other always broken) was a nightmare... there was an evening where we waited 22 minutes for the lift to get to us... we was on the 44th floor... nightmare! -(at no fault of the hotel) It snowed the whole week we were there... now although i did say this hotel was in a very good location. using the subway was real tricky with the ice and snow.Would we go back? ... well it was good value for money, so i think we would...","Southampton, United Kingdom","Neal H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southampton, United Kingdom</strong>",20,4.0

Our room was quite dark, though, and one of the two bulbs in the bathroom mirror was out so it made it a bit difficult to put on makeup in there. No light overhead, except for inside the shower. I don’t go to New York to spend time in a hotel, though, so it wasn’t a big deal. Beds were comfy. I probably wouldn’t recommend this hotel to tourists who are going to NYC for the first time since it’s at the very south end of the city and away from the majority of things tourists want to see on their first trip. But, for someone like me who has been many times and feels comfortable with the subway, it was perfect. Whitehall and Bowling Green stations are both within a block or so and serve a number of lines.

Only bad thing I have to say is the elevators are incredibly slow. There was a sign posted stating that their would be maintenance on the elevators so they may be fixed by now. If you happen to request a cab or Uber you should do so after you reach the 1st floor. It literally took about 10 minutes to get to the 1st floor every single time I left my room.

The Doubletree was conveniently located downtown, close by most offices you need to get to in the FiDi, and also plenty of subway options if you need to get uptown (1, 4-5, R). this is not an area for great shopping.Check-in was swift. Staff was friendly and even offered a cookie! I wouldn't have known if she didn't offer, so that gesture was MUCH appreciated.My room was right behind an elevator shaft and ice machine and was not disturbed by these during my stay (I am a light sleeper). The room was clean albeit a bit snug, probably just enough for one person. They provided the foldable luggage stand, but i could not find floor space for this and chose to leave them on the counter instead. Bathroom was also clean, although i spotted an ant hole near the shower area - didn't bother me as they steered clear of my toiletries. Apart from the usual shampoo, conditioner, and shower foam, other toiletries (shaver, q-tip etc.) was upon request only. Would be swell if they provided these upfront. I did not request for these as i found it to be too much of a hassle. The air conditioning was noisy and temperamental. I felt that lighting in the room was insufficient, even in the bathroom (I was unable to get enough light to tweeze my eyebrows).Free wifi not provided!!! your only option is pay-per-day, unless you are a hilton member. i ordered pasta from the room service, which came from the Italian Restaurant downstairs - Ancora. Service was quick but food was nothing to shout about (very fresh ingredients though!). I stress: I was looking more for convenience than good food.my biggest concern was the elevators, which, to my relief, I did not encounter horrific waiting times. there really is no ""best time of the day"" secret to taking the elevators but on the whole, my elevator experience (from the time it took to hail a lift, to the time i got off the floor i need to get to) took me anytime between 2 and 10 minutes.Check out was delayed due to a technical issue with the printer and I almost got an incomplete printout of my bill, had the staff not chase me down just as i was about to leave in the elevator.overall, stay was comfortable but i probably could not stay here for an extended period of time (>10 days)","Singapore, Singapore","harlequeen_yx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",75,3.0

That being said, we booked 5 months in advance and prepaid to get an amazing price. We'd requested a high floor and a refrigerator in the room. The staff was very accommodating with both requests. About a month prior to the trip I'd read the upsurge in comments about the elevator problems, and contacted them to change us to a low floor. They booked us on the 4th floor and we did have a refrigerator in the room. Checking in was no problem. I meant to speak to James and thank him for his amazing customer service, but did not get the opportunity. So, Thank you! We only had 1 day when the elevators were so full we took the stairs. Sat. morning is a very busy time.The room had a very comfortable bed, and was not rundown. Housekeeping did a fine job each day. Lu even left us a little note one day, adding a very personal touch. Issues some people may have:The bathroom is small, and if you have a lot of cosmetics/toiletries you may find it difficult to store them all. There is only the one towel hook, as reported previously. Perhaps adding another to the same wall, would calm these concerns. Personally, I wasn't doing the laundry, so it was not an issue for me. To save space in the room and the bath, there is a 'pocket' door to the lav., which means the full length mirror is on the outside of the door. There is a type of chifferobe to use as a closet, with plenty of hangers. There was also space in there for our luggage, which cleared space in the room. I believe for the price we paid this was an excellent value, with a fair sized room in an amazing location. Impressive location:Within a 5 minute walk were two subway stations, Whitehall, and Bowling Green. We were able to get to Time's Square or Coney Island in less than 30 minutes. A leisurely 10 minute walk gets you to the Staten Island ferry or the Statue of Liberty port. We walked to the Wall St. Bull, Wall St. NYSE building, the Federal Building, Trinity Church, and the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in about a mile.

The lines seemed to always be long at the front desk, but it was the weekend in Manhattan so that was expected. The workers were always friendly though, despite being busy. The rooms were small of course, but good for a New York hotel. And they were always clean, which is very important to me. As far as location, it is at the very southern part of the island. So it is far from the main tourist attractions up near Midtown, Times Square and Central Park. But it is close to the Staten Island Ferry to see the Statue of Liberty and the 9/11 Museum (which I recommend). There are a few metro stops literally steps from this hotel.As others have said, the elevators are very slow. It was okay going up to the room, but going down was always a lot slower. I did take the stairs down a few times. So I would request a low floor in case you want to take the stairs.

We have no concerns with the hotel other than the ATM they have at the check in will not take international debit or credit cards. We went to the pharmacy at the end of the street and they had a ATM that worked great. When we arrived at the hotel we saw the parking ramp right across the street. I rolled down my window and asked if they were affiliated or were part of the Double Tree across the street. The person did not speak good English but he did say yes, so we pulled in to the underground parking. When we got to the ticket booth the assistant said it would cost us $42.00 then he ""Oh I made mistake you have van so cost is $52.50"" well we thought the parking would be taken care of at the registration desk only to find out that this parking lot is not part of the Double Tree - their parking lot is about a block away so quite a distance to carry bags and suitcases. Had we known we would have dropped off our luggage at the front door and one of us would park the car. When we got to the registration desk that is where we learned about their parking lot although the clerk did stamp our tickjet and said it was up to the parking attendant if he would accept it. You can all guess what happened about the stamped ticket. The hotel was great - the check in - no problem as we had booked ahead of time. We were coming to NY to go to the 911 Memorial and we had the opportunity to see the 2 pools of remembrance. We had dinner at the little pub right next door to Double Tree and we had a great evening. We were about 5 min's late for Happy Hour but the honoured us the first round of drinks and the server was most informative, even going to the owner and telling why we were here (my husband is a Canadian Fire Captain and we wanted to pay our respect to the 911 Memorial. The little pub was great and nice and close. When we left the next morning and went directly to the parking garage only to find out they would not honour having the ticket stamped. We were stuck paying $52.50. I told the attendant that he had misinformed people working there. Had we known the parking lot was not affiliated with the hotel we would never have parked there but we were between a rock and a hard place.

The hotel met all expectations. Service was great. I never once had an issue with the level of service. The only thing I can complain about was abit water spilling out from the shower. Having said that, front desk did offer me an upgrade but I refused because I couldn't be bothered relocating.The gentlemen at the entrance were helpful. The lifts are a tad slow but I was on the ninth floor so I didn't really feel it being a major issue. So I missed my flight to vegas and I thank James for accommodating me as best as he could considering the hotel was booked out once I'd checked out. Management tried tirelessly to find me another hotel and was kind enough to mind my luggage for a good part of that day.In general I've never had a bad experience with hotels.. i guess if you rock up with a bad attitude, expect a bad one back. Point is, whatever happens before check in, eg a bad flight or taxi experience..leave that experience behind you and you'll find you'll have a better one at the hotel.The rooms were fairly spacious for new york standards. The bathrooms were abit limited but clean. I'd much rather a small clean bathroom than a big filthy one. I would stay here again. I bonded well with the staff and access to everything is a train ride away. I really enjoyed waking up and going for a stroll amongst the local corporate crowd. There are a few cool cafes and bagel places around stone street. Stone street / wall st is full of history if your into that stuff and the WTC site is a ten minute walk away. Again I'd like to thank all of the hotel staff for such a pleasant stay.

It is new-ish and modern and clean and well located (for me). Price was reasonable compared to other options. However there are some issues that are typical for a hotel of this size and location (NYC). But these issues are not fatal flaws and are not signs that the hotel is not trying to be a good hotel. Instead the issues are related to the shape and size of the hotel which are fixed and are what they are. You can work around the issues and you will be fine. The key issue is that all spaces in the hotel are small and tight. This is what you get in downtown NYC for a modest price nice hotel. The room is small but fine. They cheat with the 'king' size bed, which is wide enough but not truly king sized in length. I'm 6'2"" and had my feet hanging off the end. The shower stall is also particularly tight fit, but who cares. The hallways are narrow, but who cares. The breakfast restaurant is small and tight as well, so you might have to wait 10 minutes for a table at prime time. All of these things are worth noting but are not huge problems.There is a real problem with the elevators. They are new and work fine. There are just not enough of them. Again, this is a problem that the hotel cannot do much about. The hotel's footprint is very small (8 or 10 rooms per floor) and it is very tall (over 40 stories). There are three elevators. But at rush hours it is very hard to get an elevator that is not jam packed when going down. People on upper floors report that the trip down takes forever because it stops essentially at every floor for people waiting, but since the elevators are full these people wait some more so it becomes a viscous cycle of slow elevators. People on the lower floors just give up and walk down. I'd suggest getting a room below the 10th floor and walking down. We walked down perhaps 80% of the time we were there. Going up is better because the elevator is essentially empty when it starts its journey up and will go to only the floors needed by the people in the cab. I dont think the views are spectacular anywhere in the building so just ask for a low floor and walk down. There is no parking, but the lot down the street charges $40 per day for hotel guests which is not that bad. Plus on weekends I would suggest that you might actually score street parking within a few blocks if you are lucky. The location was great for us. Walked to Statue of Liberty ferry. Walked to 9/11 memorial. The Wall Street bull is 2 blocks away. The subway is 100 feet from the hotel and we took the 'R' train to Central Park easily. Taxi's to mid town were $15-$20.All in all we were happy with our stay here. Location makes up for tight fits. I did not mind walking down a few flights to avoid the elevators.

The hotel's solution was to have one of the 3 elevators (for 44 floors) running in ""manual"" mode, which meant you called Guest Services from the phone in the hallway, and they sent a message via walkie talkie to the staff person operating the elevator. One person in our room waited 30+ minutes to smoke a cigarette, after calling for the elevator 3 times. The positives about the hotel, should you consider it, or if they get the elevators to function: easy walking distance to Battery Park, Wall Street, 9/11 museum, Staten Island Ferry, Bowling Green or Whitehall subway stops; bellmen who go out of their way for you. (thanks to Tony who walked my 80+ year old mom and me 3 blocks away to hail a cab, after the one he called for us didn't wait, while we were waiting on the elevator)I did discuss our issues with Assistant GM Misha Foster who refunded us 1/2 of our first night stay, which was appreciated.

During all but 2 of those visits, the hotel's elevators have had problems. I don't know if an easy solution exists but a solution is sorely needed.This DoubleTree has many attributes in its favor. The selection of television channels is above average. The exercise room is open 24/7, includes 3 incline treadmills, which I favor, and a handy water filter (although of modest importance since the quality of the tap water is decent (half-liter bottles are a good size to bring for refilling)). The HHonors breakfast is served starting at 6:00AM on weekday mornings, whereas far too many other hotels operate under the erroneous presumption that a 6:30 start of the morning meal is early enough for business travelers on the go. As to the quality of the breakfast buffet, the food is consistently good, whereas the quality of the service fluctuates. If the restaurant manager is on duty, the service is crisp. If he is not, the service varies from good to lazy.Numerous restaurants can be found within a 5-minute walk, including Pot Belly, Au Bon Pain and, my favorite, Flavors Café. Conveniently, there's a Post Office just down Whitehall from the end of Stone Street.Taxis can be difficult to find but the hotel has a doorman on duty most of the time who can assist.Perhaps best of all, half of the rooms on the upper floors have a truly unbeatable view of the Freedom Tower, which is gorgeous and inspiring day or night. It is a worthy successor to the previous edifices which were taken from the world by brute force.The rooms themselves are snug but it's important to remember that all spaces tend to be small in Manhattan.","Orlando, Florida","Corbett K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",41,5.0

This usually works out pretty well for us and we have gotten used to having four of us in tight spaces - hey, it's New York! This time we were focusing on sightseeing in lower Manhattan a decided to stay in the financial district. We were really glad we did. This is a great great property. I am not anywhere near high tier in HHonors, but that got us free wifi and bottled water at check in. I had booked a king junior suite since it was the same price as a room with two queens. We arrived an hour earlier than the stated check in time and there was not junior suite immediately ready, so we were offered two adjoining king rooms instead. What an upgrade! Having two bathrooms and the extra room made this a luxurious weekend. Thank you Justina! I felt like the guy on the ""booking.yeah!"" commercials. We stayed on the 6th floor (of 42) which allowed us to walk down if we did not want to wait for the elevator. These rooms would have been a lot more expensive and a lot smaller in a more crowded hotel in mid-town. Staff were uniformly excellent. Obviously the financial district is not the weekend madhouse that uptown can be. We were surprised how great the location is. Multiple subway lines are within a block, the restaurant scene on Stone Street could not be better, and Battery Park was a three minute walk. Very convenient for World Trade Center and Lady Liberty. We did a theater evening and it was less than 30 minutes by subway. Coming home we took a cab and it was only $15.50 from Times Square.

As long as you don't have expectations of grandeur, it shouldn't be surprising. The furnishings were comfortable and the bathroom nicely updated.

I don't think a rack or a couple of hooks would take up too much real estate.So the burning question: what about the elevators? If you're looking to multi-task and get a workout in while, say, contemplating life's mysteries, make sure you get an upper floor. I was on the 41st and got really good at navigating the ups and down with heels on. During my 3 night stay only 2 of the 3 elevators where in service. If you needed to get to your room off-hours, the wait wasn't too bad. During rush hour, well, read two sentences back. Or, set the alarm 30 minutes earlier than you normally would.As far as convenience, it's smack dab in the middle of the financially district and tons of restaurants. Don't ask Yelp, just walk around and you'll find something cool and different for every meal of the day. WTC is just a few blocks away, as is the river. I had a car and there was a parking garage directly across the street that was, by NY standards, very reasonably priced.3 stars because of the elevators.

It is within walking distance to many great restaurants and interesting landmarks. I was here on business and chose this hotel as it was close to where my 3 day workshop was located and it had an onsite restaurant. The rooms are clean and comfortable; the staff is very friendly. I had no issues with guest services in any way when I needed them. I was concerned about our room being right outside the elevators, but any noise concerns due to elevators proved to be a non-issue. There a few things that I would consider drawbacks to the stay:The elevators, as many have noted, are extremely slow during peak hours for business. It was next to impossible to get an elevator on our floor in the morning, even waited as long as 10 minutes. My colleague and I ended up taking the stairs each weekday morning of our stay, and most evenings. Thankfully we were on the 11th floor and in decent physical shape, I think this would present a challenge for most people. It takes several minutes to get hot water in the shower. I didn't actually time it, but I got to the point of turning the shower on and letting the water run until the shower door started to steam- my guess is 5 minutes. I never got anything more than lukewarm warm water from the sink. There is too much sink and not enough counter space- the bathroom had one of those modern style sinks rather than a basin, so there was minimal room for one person to put there toiletries down, let alone two. lack of counter space also resulted in either putting the hair dyer in the sink, on the toilet lid or on the floor when styling hair - not desirable at all. We ended up moving the hair dryer to the desktop area, which was more ergonomically better, but sacrificed lighting, unless you turn on ever single light in the room. So even though were ""ecelogical"" by reusing towels each day, the waste in energy and water just to get your normal daily grooming done was very high. Food trays from someone's room service were left in the hallway for over 24 hours - which surprised me due to the cleanliness of the hotel. If the guest did not call for tray pickup, you would think housekeeping would have when making their rounds. These concerns would have me looking at other options if I were to stay inn this area again, but neither would they preclude me from choosing this hotel again as the overall experience was fine. The staff was great, the room was always in great shape, and the location was terrific. The restaurant was above average in quality as well.","South Meriden, Connecticut, United States","Mary D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Meriden, Connecticut, United States</strong>",4,4.0

My main beef is that I asked no fewer than four times for itemized receipts for the meals I had on-site. My company will not reimburse business expenses without an itemized receipt. I am sure this must be true for 99% of business travelers, so why this is a surprise to the waiters, restaurant managers, and front desk staff is a mystery. Certainly they are asked this every single day. As of now, I still don't have them, despite being promised the manager would email them in 24 hours. I had concerns about the overall safety and condition of this hotel. I was on the 20th floor and the entire room had a weird vibration about it. I was wondering if the laundry or mechanicals were on the floor beneath me. It actually made me feel a little sick on the first day. I had adjusted to it by day 2, but it was certainly not a pleasant experience. The room was tiny and cramped, more than one person in it would have been an issue. View was of the office building across the street.The room also had an unpleasant odor. The shower had mildew or mold in the corners, and didn't look clean. I had work to do, but found myself looking for reasons to go out and walk in the cold to not be in there.Elevators are an issue. For a 40+ story hotel, there are three elevators and only two of them appeared to work. One is reserved for the hotel staff and they will personally take you up to your floor if the one working elevator is elsewhere. This is such an issue that they have a letter from the management posted next to the elevator. I realize they may not have control over the speed at which the elevators are repaired, but based on other reviews, this has been going on for some time.Room service trays were left in the very narrow hallway for hours on the end. Disgusting.Cabs are also scarce. I ended up walking to my destination in 30 degree weather, fine for me, but not great if you have expectations that cabs will be readily available.

The employees of this hotel are great overall including the housekeeping staff. I am a Hilton Gold member and upon check-in I was given a WTC view room on a high floor as I requested. This turned out to be a very bad mistake on my part. Firstly, the hotel is over 40 floors and is serviced by only 3 elevators. At the time of my stay only 1 of the 3 were operating on the first day and 2 of the 3 on the second. This caused extremely long waits to either get to your room or get our of the hotel. Usually to leave I waited around 7 minutes for an elevator to come to my floor. To get up to my room from the ground floor was usually on the longer side, around 10 minutes. My stay was for the weekend of February 14th. On Saturday evening probably starting around 4pm the fire alarm started going off for a few minutes at a time followed by an announcement that it was just a false alarm and that they are working on the system. I thought nothing of it but then it happened a few more times over the next hour or two. I left the hotel for dinner and returned around 9:30pm to head to my room. Right around 10:30 or so the fire alarm began to go off again while I was already asleep in bed. I assumed it was another false alarm and tried to ignore it and go back to sleep. After about 30 minutes of continuous alarm I began to hear noises outside of my room and looked outside and realized that it was an actual fire alarm as people were rushing for the emergency exits. This is where having a room with a view on the 38th floor did not bode well as I had to quickly find warm clothes to put on and then proceed to walk down 38 flights of stairs to exit the building. This also happened to be the weekend of New York's coldest weekend in 20 years with temperatures in the low single digits and wind gusts of 30mph. As we neared the ground floor there was a huge amount of confusion amongst the guests as to whether we were to be waiting in the lobby or outside in the cold since the rumor that had quickly spread on our long walk down that it was a false alarm from a broken pipe or something of that nature flooding an elevator shaft and some of the rooms. We ended up congregating outside waiting for some direction as to what was going on. Many of us ended up heading to the bar next door that was luckily open still to wait it out and get some warmth and beer. Once the building was given the all clear to go back in we all quickly realized that there was only 1 elevator in operation now for the 40+ story hotel and that every guest needed to get back into their room. This created long lines out into the cold of people standing around waiting and hoping the single elevator would be coming by soon and that it would not be full already from other guest who walked up a few floor to try to catch it empty on the way down. When it was all said and done I ended up getting back into my room just after 1:30am. Now having a fire alarm go off can happen in any hotel at any time. The main issue I had with this hotel was that they had numerous false alarms all evening with no explanation besides the pre-recorded one saying to ignore the alarm. Then once the real alarm went off majority of the guests ignored it. Had this been a real fire and we all waited like we did to pay attention to the alarm I am sure there would have been many casualties that night. The building's management does not seem to have any fire safety system or protocol in place to handle a situation they had like that night with contractor issues and repeated false alarms. Once all the guest's had exited the hotel with half in the lobby and half outside there still was no direction from the hotel as to what was going on. It was just a matter of mulling around in the freezing temperatures outside until the firemen had left the building and we all just decided it was okay to make our way back in. Understanding that the building may be quite old I feel like management should be hiring more competent contractors that know how important it is to have at least 2 elevators working in such a huge building at the minimum. They also need to have a better plan in place for such emergency's which they obviously didn't. We never received any type of message on the room phone or a note under the door the following morning or the next apologizing for the situation or at the least explaining what exactly had happened that night. That simple note under the door I think would have appeased majority of the guests the next morning. On the plus side, the bar next door had TouchTunes!","Tampa, Florida","wherearethenachos</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tampa, Florida</strong>",4,2.0

Room is Manhattan size but designed to make the most of the space.The king bed was very comfortable and I slept well every night. There was also a comfortable easy chair and desk chair. So once in the room, everything was OK. Getting out of the room and down to the street was problematic. As stated by everyone who has stayed here, the 3 elevators are very slow. Not only that but you could hear the elevators pass our floor and never stop. They had a problem with the middle elevator a few weeks ago so it was run manually for the weekend. Signs by the elevator said to use the hall phone to call the desk to have an elevator sent but we only got through to the desk once. Received busy signals all other times. I used my cell phone to call for help. Once we finally decided to walk down 16 floors to get out. BTW, I passed on a room upgrade to a city view room on the 44th floor. The elevators were not the only problem I encountered. The phones in my room would not keep a charge so I could call out. Push a button and the phone would go dead. Googled the hotel on my cell phone and dialed the first number listed on the Hilton link. Received a message that I dialed a wrong number and it was not in service. Got through on the second number. An engineer came, told me to unplug the phone for 15 minutes and plug it back in. That worked for a day. By the next night, the phone no longer worked. So I'm on the 16th floor with no hotel phone to call out and elevators that never come.Hotel excuses ranged from we know they're slow that's why we have a manual elevator to we have 2 large tour groups and that makes it slow this weekend. Shouldn't the hotel have large groups every day?Bottom line: the room was very comfortable but the elevators and phones make me wary of staying there.

The room, including the bathroom, were clean and the wardrobe space was tiny and suitable for only one person. The bathroom again in my opinion did not provide enough shelf space for two people. Thankfully lots of clean towels were provided and shower is a joy to use with a fantastic shower head. Adequate desk space and a chair provided if you need to get some work done with a spotlight to brighten the dull lights in the room. I was located on the 9th floor and had a wonderful view of the brick wall of the building opposite me! While this may seem not wonderful, I must be thankful that I was not placed any higher as the lifts service does not arrive in a timely manner and after the first time going down and having to wait 15 minutes for the lift to arrive, we opted to walk down on each occasion apart from when we were checking out!

The lobby is on the second floor and when I arrived at 11:30 on Monday evening, everyone was friendly, recognizing my Diamond status, giving me my cookie (excellent, by the way), and presenting me with a present for being one of their top 12 guests for the day. Then they told me if I had arrived earlier, they had tickets for me for a concert at the Conrad. I thought that a particularly nice touch, especially after a frustrating day with Delta Airlines making me go around the world to get to NYC, arriving seven hours later than scheduled, I thought the trip was getting on a better track.Now, remember I praised the staff at the Doubletree Financial District in the previous paragraph. I cannot say enough about their efforts to make their guests feel welcome. The hotel certainly needs that because while I have not read other reviews on the hotel, I had plenty of people tell me over the course of the week that all reviews mention issues with the elevators. Well, I’m here to attest the elevators, at least during my four night stay, were an issue. In fact, on Wednesday, there was only one elevator running, but they did have hotel staff operating it, probably as efficiently as one elevator in a 44 floor hotel can be. At other times, there were two running, one under normal operation and the other manually. Here again, the staff was excellent, and my kudos to them.Anyone who has ready any of my reviews knows I am a “Hilton guy” as well as the TravelGuy. Having spent close to 150 nights in Hilton properties in 2014, I think I’m pretty dedicated to them. The hotel is typical for NYC, with ten rooms per floor, best I could tell. I was on the 44th floor, good for getting a place on the elevator going down, but inconvenient when the elevators were struggling. One of the staff told me he makes the 44 floor stair walk twice a day, for security purposes, I suspect, and it takes 20 minutes to climb the 44 flights. I did experience a couple of times when I thought after my wait for the elevator, I would have been better off just getting a good bit of exercise by walkingWhen I got into my room, it looked pretty good and the size was huge for NYC, based on previous experience. When I went to set the alarm, the display on the clock was cryptic. I couldn’t tell what time it was displaying, so it was pretty close to impossible to set the alarm, so thankfully I was able to use my phone for my alarm. Then, as I got ready for bed, I went to the closet to get the laundry bag. Ooops, no laundry bag there. This was the second item I added to the list to leave at the front desk on Tuesday morning. Tuesday morning brought shower time and when I get out of the shower I realized the door didn’t shut/seal and there was a puddle of water, only modestly absorbed by the rug. This was another item to add to the list. Just one other thing while I’m talking about the shower. I couldn’t get the water to shut off so that was the fourth item for the list I left at the front desk on Tuesday morning. One other thing, while I’m talking about the shower, I want to salute the men and women of the United States armed forces for the job they do every day in protecting our country and freedoms, because the inconsistency of the water temperature reminded me of the old military barracks days when if someone turned on the cold water or flushed the toilet, the shower temperature heated up quickly. That was my experience during several showers.When I came in Tuesday afternoon, the water had been turned off in the shower, but it was obvious housekeeping had not been in my room that day. It was 5:00 or so when I got in, but a call to the front desk and asked to get the room cleaned and they promptly got prompt housekeeping to clean the room; however, still no laundry bag and the shower door didn’t appear any different. Oh, and the clock was still cryptic. Anyone who knows the Hilton system knows Diamond and Gold members receive a complimentary continental breakfast but the NYC Financial District provided a complimentary buffet. My kudos go out on that one. The buffet had a good selection, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, pancakes, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, and probably some other things I missed. Tuesday and Wednesday morning didn’t seem that busy or maybe I had gotten up early and got in and got out. Food quality was good both of those mornings. Thursday and Friday mornings seemed to be particularly busy, but I got seated quickly both of those mornings. It was busy and it seemed the eggs and bacon particularly were being replenished on a regular basis and while they were fresh, the eggs were cold both mornings.The fitness center is located on the third floor and is equipped with three treadmills, two ellipticals, a bike, weight machine, and free weights. Pads and balls are also provided. For a hotel fitness facility, it provided good equipment in a nice sized room. Cardio equipment faces Stone Street so you can get a view of the Nebraska Beef Steakhouse across the street.. One other note, recognizing the hotel’s efforts to correct the problem, they had the elevator people work overnight Thursday night and being on the 44th floor, that was where they were running the new cable for one of the elevators that was down. I know they worked well past midnight because I could hear them working with the cable (not a quiet task). I finally got to sleep but woke up to the noise of the workers before 7am. I understand the urgency in getting the repair completed, but really!All said, I hate to be negative, and hopefully you have noted I recognize the staff at this hotel as top-notch in making guests feel welcome, but the Doubletree NYC Financial District certainly had Murphy’s Law going against it during my four night stay. The front desk staff did provide additional points at checkout for my stay for the inconvenience of the elevators, and being the “Hilton guy” I am, I would probably give the Doubletree Financial District another opportunity if I am in that area, but I will be guarded in hoping all three elevators are in operating order if I return. Again, kudos to an excellent staff for making up for the other multiple shortcomings I encountered during my stay.","Memphis, Tennessee","NovackTravelGuy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Memphis, Tennessee</strong>",442,3.0

Went up to the room, it was clean and functional with a good TV selection and extortionate Wi-Fi rates. The room was a little on the small side, but on the flipside this is central New York. Gave the impression that it was like a facility that processes tourists, rather than one that attends to their need, functionality rather than luxury, though it wasn't an oppressive environment. It had the metro downstairs so this was benefical within easy reach of major attractions allowing you to traverse the city with ease. Probably a mid to low end business hotel rather than a hotel for luxury or to relax in. Perfect for a short stay (5 days) but no longer. Low cost too.

I arrived to one of the three elevators working. I had two rooms on the 9th Floor for me and my godson. We found ourselves ascending or descending steps repeatedly during the entire three day stay. At one point all three elevators were out of service. Long lines, stretching outside to the brutal cold, formed on the ground floor as guests waited for the one elevator that had come back into service. Guests were not happy. Saturday evening fire alarms repeatedly went off for hours. On the intercom hotel staff assured guests that it was only a test and that there was no need to evacuate. At one point fire trucks could be heard arriving at the building, but because of the announcements I gave no thought to leaving the hotel. I learned as I left later that evening - riding the one working elevator with water dripping from the ceiling - that there was an actual fire on one of the floors above me. I was told by staff that one of the two inoperable elevators has been flooded with water. I also concerned about the cleanliness of the hotel. On my floor room service trays with half eaten food sat in the hallway all day Saturday and Sunday. They were still there when I checked out early Monday morning. I didn't understand this since housekeeping made up my room daily. The rooms in the hotel were modern and nice sized. The beds comfortable, but getting back and forth to the rooms and the fire alarms made the stay must unpleasant. Worst of all management of the hotel seemed oblivious to the entire situation. I'm a loyal Hilton Honors customer. I've stayed at other Hilton properties where management has written a letter and had it delivered to the guest rooms apologizing for service that fell below Hilton standards. And in those instances, it was nowhere near as outrageous as what I experience at this Hilton property. The DoubleTree Financial District management placed their staff at a disadvantage in dealing with irate guests. I witnessed staff being berated by guests upon my checkout at 4 a.m. One woman was so irate security was called. I can't see myself ever staying at this property again.","San Francisco, California","Everett M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",2,1.0

Housekeeping was good, even sent us a thank you note for our tips. I know the Europeans are known for being bad tippers, in our country is not a common thing but after our last visite we try to adapt to the US culture of tipping when we really believe somebody is trying to do their best. Our shower was leaking so everytime we've taken a shower and the whole bathroom was flooded, my boyfriend told the front desk about it and it got fixed asap. In the end of our trip it started to leak again. The room was average size, good clean and modern for NYC standards. We used hotels.com to book the hotel and got a great deal for a Doubletree Hilton in Manhattan. We loved the big choice of tv channels, the bed was comfortable, kingsize a bit short for my Dutch tall boyfriend but it was all good. Cons There was no free wifi in the room you have to purchase for USD 9,99, but because of the snow blizzard or maybe because of our tips we've received complimentary wifi for the last 3 days. On the day of our departure we checked out at 12 'o clock. We had already arranged our own transfer to the Airport with a car service I always use the same car service when I am in NYC. We had to depart from the hotel to Newark airport 2:30 PM. The frontdesk told us to go downstairs and give our luggage to the bellboy for storage. The bellboy did some small talk asked us our pick up time for the luggage and asked us where we need to go to. We told them we will be back at 2:30 PM and that our own driver will pick us up, he asked my name and my room number and gave me the tickets for our luggage. We had lunch outside and did our last round of shopping and returned early to the hotel to go the restroom. When I arrived I already saw a car parked in front of the hotel with my name (misspelled) on a piece of paper, I thought it was weird because our carservice is run by Chinese and I have a common Chinese last name, but I did not pay attention to it. So we went to the lobby for a quick pit stop collected our bags from the bellboy (I gave him a $1 tip) and were driven to Newark airport. When the driver approach the car I noticed he was not Chinese and got suspicious, because our car service is runned by Chinese drivers. We were stuck in traffic for almost a hour and even though we left on time we had to rush a bit because of the traffic jam. On arrival at Newark airport the guy took our luggage out of the car my boyfriend paid him in cash USD 60, that is a fixed price including a tip. The guy started to tell us that we did not pay him enough. At that point I told him it is a fix price and I told him to call his boss. Then he got a pricelist out of the car and we saw he was not from our taxi company. I told him that we are in hurry to catch our flight and it was not agreed on to pay more he got really mad and shouted at us and got agressive and cussed at us. I told him to call the police if he disagreed with us. My boyfriend try to mediate but he would not stop the driver got back into his car and was mad and drove away we ran to the check in desk and catched our flight. What happened is that the bellboy sent our car service away and phoned his own car service. I am so disappointed about this. In a review from booking.com something similiar happened to a couple from Switzerland they got also scammed by the carservices that the bellboy had arranged. We did not ask for a car and then he sends our own car away. I would like to report this at the hotel manager and I really hope that they deal with their staff.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Hellokitty84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",44,3.0

The thermostat was a little tough to regulate. One moment it's blowing hot air and the next it's cold. Also, this hotel has 40+ floors but only 3 elevators, so be prepared to wait some time. However, I give the hotel high marks for being in a GREAT location (close to subway and plenty of restaurants and bars), having an onsite restaurant/lounge, and being clean and quiet.

And by care I mean I could see he cared for both the hotel brand he work for and more specially the guest (I say this as a loyal customer to the Hilton hotels). If I had to point one negative side of this hotel, I would say, elevators, slow and packed with people, specially to go up, but, again, that was during an extremely busy holiday, so I would not take points out because of that. The breakfast is awesome as well as dining on the Italian restaurant of the hotel, Antinori. One odd thing is the entrance, since is on the ground level while the lobby is on the second level. One great thing about location, steps from Wall Street, Battery Park and subway.

Arrival is alright. The entrance to the hotel may be a bit hidden to the untrained eye, and walking into the building, you would think you're not in a hotel as you're just met with an elevator bank. Checkin was smooth, and the cookies are great—they are at every DoubleTree, so that doesn't really boost the review of this particular location. After getting a good night's sleep, I woke up, got ready and headed over to the elevator bank. The conference I was attending was literally a 90 second walk around the block, so leaving my room with 20 minutes to spare should have been perfect. However, the elevators in this hotel are SO slow that I was late. You heard it. I waited 20+ minutes for an elevator to stop on my floor, and I was late. When I returned back to my room that evening, the heater was broken. I called the front desk and asked for someone to inspect, and then I left for a few drinks and food. There are a ton of bars and places to eat in this area. A lot are Irish pubs, but there are other options available. When I returned to my room, the heater was fixed. I experienced no more issues with it. The elevators continued to be a sore spot. 15-20 minute waits every time I wanted to lave the building.

The first folks that we met (other than our shuttle driver), were those at the Doubletree Hotel New York City-Financial District. Not a bad impression of the city’s folks.So, I really want to be fair to this hotel (actually, I always want to be fair but truthful). Right off the start, I will state that we probably would return to this establishment but would also look around for a better deal first.The staff that we met, to a person, were knowledgeable, efficient, pleasant and more than willing to help with directions or suggestions. Our three day stay was great and most of it was due to these new friends.Location wise, the Doubletree Hotel New York City-Financial District is close to several subway stations. It is a short walk to the boats to the statue of liberty (right by Battery Park). Lots of pubs (seemed to be mostly Irish) and restaurants are just a stroll away.The much often mentioned elevators were never a problem. We were in room 3802 and used it a lot. The longest wait from calling to landing was 3 minutes. As suggested I took a book to read and never got to the first page. Having stated this, we were there on a weekend (good time to be in the financial district). Perhaps they are busier on weekdays.The hallways are hallways. They are about the size of a cruise ship’s. I had no problem with them and I am six foot 205 pounds (before pubs). There are only 10 or so rooms on the 38th floor. So, we never met too many patrons in the hall.Our room however, was small about the size of a cruise ship’s suite. There really was no problem with that as we spent little time in it. The bed is short (about the size of a cruise ship’s). It is about 5 foot 10 inches. I slept like a (curled) log. The staff that serviced the room could have been much better and really pulled down my rating. The only time 3802 was made up, the towels were changed and the bed made. Not a single thing else. No clean glasses, ice bucket not emptied, no fresh soap, shampoo (almost ran out), conditioner, etc. This is my only real complaint.The shower was okay but you had to learn a pattern. Set the water to the desired temperature. If it starts to get hotter, step out of the stream and wait a second or two. Then it will go really cold. Wait another moment and continue the shower. Oh yes, no stopper in the sink. This happens often and it is a real pain if you need to keep water in the sink. (Okay, 3 complaints.) It could use a little maintenance but I don’t own it, so have no problem with defective piecesThe doormen were great.

Check in was quick and painless, and we were assigned a room on a high floor. The room was a fair size (not massive, but it is NYC) and was well equipped. Hairdryer, iron etc all in the room, good size flatscreen tv, lots of channels, powerful shower, nice bathoom. See attached for a map of the hotel floor (work from bottom right , clockwise, which is room XX01 through to XX10 where XX is your floor). the 01 - 06 rooms look North, 07-08 South, not sure about 09-10.The lifts focus heavily in previous reviews. We did not wait more than 5 minutes for a lift, and this was only on 2 occasions. Generally the lifts were on your floor within a minute. Usually there were hotel staff in the lifts, going about their business, Every one of them made an effort to say hello and have a conversation. Definitely the friendliest staff I've came across.The Whitehall St subway is at the end of the street, from which you can get a train straight uptown to Times Sq or 34th St to all the attractions. This takes no more than 15-20 minutes and passes every 12 mins or so. It is also easy to catch a taxi from the end of the street.A small irish pub underneath the hotel was great. extremely welcoming, serving great food. It's open until 4am, but we heard no noise. It is probably different if you are on the first few low floors at the front of the building however.There is a small market at the end of the street for the usual amenities, and a liquor store within a 5 minute walk. Very handy.The Staten island ferry is also a 5 minute walk away, which is well worth a visit.On leaving, the hotel arranged a town car for us to take us back to JFK.

I had never been to NYC before and was looking for a more lively neighborhood. Wall Street is a very boring place to stay. Guess it's because it caters to the 9-5'rs and after work drinks crowd. We wanted to get some food on a Saturday night and nothing was open except for McDonald. We thankfully found a bar that was still serving food at midnight: The Growler. Back e hotel: the elevators are brutally slow but thankfully we were on the 9h floor and could do the stairs if need be. The free wifi only works in the lobby and if you want it in your room you have to pay $10 per 24 hours.This is not ideal if you want to plan your day and have to go down to the lobby every time.The room was a decent size and the king bed was very comfortable.The staff were very friendly and helpful and the warm cookies at check in were a nice touch.,,kimadian,5,3.0

We were there on the weekend, and since the financial district pretty much is gone on the weekend it was nice and quiet. Staff were friendly and professional. I will echo prior comments regarding slow elevators and small rooms, but I found neither of these issues to be major problems.

The good: the room looked really nice. If you are driving there, a separate parking deck is directly across the street so you can park and then go to the hotel.The bad: The room is extremely small, the elevators are painfully slow, and I regret choosing the Financial District. The room is really nice looking, but you do feel like the room is so tiny that you wonder how it got a 4 star rating. There are three elevators and there are over 40 floors of rooms. You will sometimes wait a long time for an elevator to come. Seriously, the worst elevators I have used at hotel. On a location note (not to blame on the hotel), the Financial District was far from the things that I wanted to see. If you are looking to go all around New York City, I definitely recommend to stay anywhere north of the Financial District. I really felt that I was deeply out of my way and had to take a subway to go anywhere.One more note: You'll have to stay a lot higher than I did (24th floor) to actually get a decent view.I would recommend this hotel to you if 1) You specifically want to stay in the Financial District 2) You don't mind the room being small and 3) You accept ahead of time that the elevators are slow.Outside of those things, the employees were friendly, they give each guest a warm chocolate chip cookie, and the room was nice looking even though it was tiny.","Annandale, Virginia","Michael R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Annandale, Virginia</strong>",13,3.0

This place is just infuriating, I've stayed several times~10x with work (office across the street) and noted nothing but problems and poor customer service.I don't pay for these stays so its not about the $ - though I've got it on Hotwire for $244/night + taxes and our corporate rate is $259/night + taxes. Off peak its a $120/night hotel (you CAN get that in NY off peak)I do not consider this close to a 3 star hotel, though they call it 4 star - amenities are tight and 3 star like. Laundry service and other inquires are slow.A summary of my stays:1) 3405 had a cockroach - I mentioned it to management at checkin (next time) but didnt want to hold up the line - management never got back to me on this (good management should have called). I look like a business traveler, not some of their sketchier clients/tourists - and again I don't pay for this.2) There is a line at check in every time - its actually 2 lines. Here is how 3 elevators are at the street level and serve 44 floors - you wait a while (normally with smokey smelling eu travelers).Once you wait the line at ground floor you wait on floor 2 behind several people as only 2 people are ever present (normally new at their job too) to check you in. (to expedite things I suggest everyone have - ID and a credit card ready to hand to them at check in - this is also not the place for tourist questions. 3 elevators for 44 floors is unlikely to be upto NYC building code but was grandfathered in in this ""historic"" building - its not historic looking. 3) You are in the financial district which is rather dead (evenings)- from now on I rather stay up in midtown and take a 30min subway ride in every morning - this place is that annoying.4) This evening, I have a cold and asked for some water at the front desk which they hand to you at check in- presumably because 1) their water from the tap is bad or 2) they know you are upset about your wait. This time though wasn't checking in - but asked for one - they pointed me to their pantry. I was surprised because other times they just hand me the $0.25 bottles of water. Again not the $ thing, I'll just expense it. Explained to them I was not satisfied pointed to their satisfaction sign started to discuss other issues - went to elevator (preparing for my wait) by then they said i should just take some water....It was too late the elevator door was closed.5) On the elevators - look you will wait up to 5mins to get up or down sometimes both - though quite ill I walked 7 floors up the other day (trying a lower floor for the walking optionallity) its quite insane.6) Car service to Newark airport - last time I left for the airport I decided not to wait for a taxi (which is a long time at this hotel its not like the rest of NY). i asked for the price, $85 including taxes and tip. Asked again to confirm. Got to airport driver asked for a tip - told him I was told $85 was all in...he said it wasn't what a situation to be put in (again not about $ ...its expensed) just utterly annoying.My solution stay away from this one!

First, one of the elevators went out of commission, leaving only two to service a busy weekend with wedding parties and busloads of tourists converging at once. Then a second went out on Sunday, leaving only one, which the hotel put on manual mode while posting signs on each floor asking us to phone the front desk to get it to stop at our floor (#29—a bit high to take the stairs with luggage). And the saga continues: After waiting a half hour for the elevator, I get to the desk and get a bill that includes $55 for valet parking upon arrival, a service we did not use. I produced my parking garage receipt and was told the charge would be taken off. It wasn't. I found it on my credit card bill the next day. Chase, responsive as always, took it off right away while the charge was contested, but Doubletree/Hilton took a week to do so with absurd back-and-forth emails before it disappeared.Two days later a new valet parking charge appeared for our departure! More emails before they discovered that the charge belonged on my wife's brother's bill (same last names). Really. Is my time worth anything?Apparently not. We got another email last last—two weeks into this—saying sorry it happened but glad it's resolved. No comp for anything, no incentive to ever come back. Stuff happens. I get that.

The lobby/reception is on the second floor, your entry is at street level on Stone Street. My problem was with the elevators. The building is 44 stories with 3 elevators. And that's not sufficient. When I stayed there, one of the elevators was out of service so the staff operated the elevators manually. I had to call the front desk to make a reservation to ride down. Took some 15 minutes. Some younger people walked the stairs down. But few, except those on lower floors, walked up. Moreover, ice machines are not on every floor. So this, too, is a problem whether or not you use the elevator. If the in-room Wi-Fi doesn't work well, try the lobby. there are also some stand alone desktops but they are generally hogged by families.I did have an in-room coffee maker and received a cookie at check-in. there's a sundry shop by the lobby desk. Since the lobby is on the second floor, I didn't return for any additional cookies or snacks. The neighborhood is wonderful for tourists.

Fraunce's Tavern, with G. Washington memorabilia, is down the block but doesn't open 'til noon if you want to wait around. Bowling Green is the closest subway stop but several others are just a short walk away. As are the buses which terminate and begin at the Battery. Some nice pubs and eateries are on the surrounding streets with al fresco dining in nice weather. But you really don't need to stay in this hotel to do all those things.

Stayed for 1 week. 2 areas for improvement - staff who did rooms did not do very good job of taking stock or lack of stock - had to call for toilet paper twice as it was not restocked. Next - shower - hot water. It took really long for hot water to come on in shower. Don't know if this has anything to do with height of hotel and if hot water has to travel far. We were on 2rd floor of 44 floor hotel. So I found it wasteful to leave water running to get it to hot.

We had low expectations, but when we arrived, we were immediately blown away. We were greeted by two bell-boys, with a big smile and a ""Welcome!"" then escorted to the elevator, told which way to go to the lobby, and shown little tricks for navigating along the way. When we arrived at the lobby, we were greeted by a really friendly, happy person, who checked us in quickly and of course (let's not kid ourselves -- this is the best part) we were given two warm, soft, chocolatey, walnut-y Doubletree cookies. The lobby itself is beautiful - modern, elegant, with a lounge style layout and feel. There is free Wifi in the lobby, if you need to look at funny pictures of cats on your phone before bed like I do. The in-room Wifi comes at a cost but is reasonably priced. The elevator runs on what I think is voodoo because it goes very very fast but doesn't feel like it at all. Our room itself was just the right size for the price - not too small, but just cozy enough. Everything looked new, clean, well -designed, and welcoming. The bed was basically the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on, a wonderful King sized pillow-top mattress which meant my boyfriend could practice his overnight karate all he wanted without me even realizing he was sleeping beside me. The bathroom was chic and modern, and even the soap was a pleasant tangy lemon flavor. Wait a second, I forgot about another amazing part.....the TV had all the best channels so that when we came back to our room every night, exhausted from exploring the city, there was always something exciting on. I've been to hundreds of hotels, and I can be hard to impress, but this hotel really left a great impression on me. As we were heading out one day, a bell-boy came up to us and said ""A tip: get on the first five metro cars when you're taking the train back. That way you can ensure you get out at the right spot!"" ....come on! Who volunteers help like that? This Doubletree was just splendid. However, I have to be fair, and mention two things that I would improve on if I were them: the first is that the air conditioner was extremely loud and woke us up every time it powered on in the middle of the night. It did work great though, but we couldn't even watch TV with it on. It was quite loud. The other thing is that the bathroom door was a sliding door that was suspended from the ceiling and wasn't actually closing the bathroom shut. That means you could hear everything that was going on inside. We took turns going to the washrooms on different floors for those...trickier situations. But aside from that, the hotel was amazing and is now our favorite hotel in NYC. Great location, great staff, great service, great layout, great cookies....you just can't go wrong. We will be recommending this hotel to everyone heading to NYC!","Ottawa, Ontario","Live2Travel86</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Ontario</strong>",32,5.0

While the rooms themselves are ok, there are several things that make this hotel a very poor choice.- the reception check in is one of the worst I have experienced. I am a Hilton honours member and have stayed at this hotel for over a month this year so far, and this all accounts for nothing upon check in. The staff are typically rude and do not operate a fast track service for Hilton honours members. The last time I stayed there, while they were serving me several phone calls came in which the reception staff member immediately answered and responded to, while I was waiting (I checked in at about 1 am due to plane delays and was desperate to get to bed, so was not impressed with the constant phone interruptions). All the staff member said was that housekeeping was not there so she was answering the phones for them. On the plus side however they do provide warm cookies upon check in and a couple of bottles of water - although they forgot to tell one customer who was checking in when I was there that the cookies contained nuts, only for her to to find out after one bite that it did. Turned out she was allergic to them. Not good.- the last time I stayed there, the wifi connection in my room didn't work. Due to flight delays I ended up checking in at about 1am and only realised this after I had unpacked my bags. I called up reception and they told me that I had to change rooms immediately or I couldn't be guaranteed wifi or another room the next day as other people would be arriving. In other hotels on the rare occasion when I have had to change rooms, the hotel staff have been apologetic and changed my rooms for me such that when I next went out and subsequently returned, all my belongings had been transferred and the new room was ready and waiting for me. The staff at the doubletree insisted that I pack up my belongings at 2am and wait for their security staff to take me to the new room and let me in. I packed and lugged my bag to the new room on a different floor and then sat in the corridor waiting for them to arrive for 20 mins, before calling reception again and finally getting someone to let me into my new room. When I went into the new room, the safe was broken and they had to spend another 20 mins fixing it. By this time it was 3am and I had only a few hours before I needed to get up for work. I was not impressed!!!- a colleague of mine stayed in the hotel with me previously and had an expensive Michael Kors bag that she had just bought stolen from her room. The staff gave her the run around when she tried to report it, sending her to concierge, security, reception, house keeping etc. no one apologised or told her what to do about it. Finally after escalating it, they agreed to pay her the price of the bag if she showed her receipt. This happened about 8 weeks ago and she is still waiting for the cheque to arrive despite contacting them several times. Seems they ""forgot to post the cheque"".- there are only 3 lifts that are very slow. In peak hours a 20 minute wait for a lift is not uncommon this is particularly bad in the morning when everyone is leaving. On one occasion when I was there 1 of the lifts was broken for the whole week, which made the queues for the lifts and the wait even longer.- the hotel air conditioning is particularly loud which makes it hard to sleep.- breakfast is one of the worst offerings at a hotel that I have been to and is expensive for what it is. The selection is small and the service isn't great.On the plus side, the rooms are a reasonably size, the beds are comfortable and it's in a good location to Wall Street where I work. It also has a well equipped gym with good equipment which is open 24 hours, which I particularly liked.These pluses do not overcome the issues noted above however - particularly the theft (which I note in other feedback here is not an isolated incident), the poor service and the ridiculously slow lifts.I now look for other hotels when I travel to the NY office for work and would not recommend this hotel.","Fleet, United Kingdom","Leunig13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fleet, United Kingdom</strong>",28,2.0

The truth is that it's a fairly nice hotel. It's extremely clean and the staff was nice enough. This has to be one of the most space impaired hotels I've ever stayed at though. I'd compare it to a cruise. The hallways are so narrow that housekeeping can't even use a standard housekeeping cart, they use rolling luggage with their cleaning supplies. The rooms are also very small but I've stayed in NYC before and that's not very atypical. The smallness is not that big of a deal.My only real complaint is the elevators. These are the slowest elevators i've ever seen in a hotel. If you need to go somewhere leave yourself a half an hour to get to the lobby. The elevators are so slow that I decided to just use the emergency stairs because it would be quicker and unfortunately I stepped wrong, rolled my ankle and hurt my ankle really badly this morning.

Have to be patient. We did not eat in the restaurant, or do room service because the food was so expensive. I know...New York. There are so many places around the hotel, no need to spend the money. The rooms are like cruise ship size and the bed was only ok on comfort. The biggest complaint we have is that the bathroom has zero counter space, so it was very annoying for a couple to get ready to attend a wedding, and we had stuff lined on the floor. Again, tight typical NY space. Also the room air conditioning was so hard to control, it was either too hot or cold. There aren't a lot of hotel choices in that area, so I would recommend it for the proximity to the Stone Street restaurants and Battery Park....but for the price, the accommodations are tight (the king bed took up the whole room).

Even by NYC standards, room was claustrophobia-inducing. In the bathroom, there was NO counter space. NONE. Even the toilet top could not be used, having a push button flush. An average height and weight adult will find the shower uncomfortable; elbow hits were unavoidable. After an all day rain, on the thirdly morning of my stay, I woke to a musty room smell. When I opened the shower door, I was so overwhelmed by a smell of mildew I nearly vomited. While I had been hesitant to change hotels due to discomfort, with significant mold allergies, relocation was a health issue now for me. I dressed and went to the lobby. The front desk clerk, upon hearing my room issue, was dismissive and told me this was impossible as it ""is a new property."" She would not make eye contact with me - rather than attempting to help, she dismissed me.I boarded an elevator to return to my room. Two staff members, security and maintenance, were there who observed I was upset. I recounted my desk experience and room problem. The security staff offered to intervene and see if another room would be better. I returned to my room and a few minutes later got a call from the front desk regarding an alternate room. She provided a room number and I was to meet security outside the potential new room right away. I went there immediately, where I waited nearly 15 minutes. The same empathetic security staff finally arrived - apologizing that he had been waiting for me on a different floor, having been given a different room number by the same front desk person whom I had encountered earlier.With the strong deodorizer scent in the room, I could not, in a matter of minutes, discern if this room was an improvement. But I needed to be out of the moldy room, and security kindly helped me relocate. I packed, and moved my things. I left for breakfast, hoping to be able to determine improvement upon return. Unfortunately, I could not. It was time to leave. I collected my belongings, returned to the lobby, and asked a different staffer if he could find a nearby hotel for me. He said he really couldn't do anything for me, offered to have the head of housekeeping checkout the prior room, and repeatedly asked what the room smelled like.With a nearly debilitating headache at this point, and a friend to help, I checked out. I had no replacement hotel but was relieved to be out.Let me be clear that there was no visible mold in this room. But given my severe allergic reaction. something seems going on in this building, and rainfall seems to exacerbate it. I am grateful to the security staff member who tried so hard to compensate for others' shortcomings. As bad as the mold problem was for me, the desk staff made the situation much much worse.

There is a restaurant on site, but no free buffet breakfast which we always find nice in most Hilton Hampton Inns, etc. The bed was very comfortable (King Size) and the room was quiet from street noise. However, their policy is to change linens on your third night's stay. We returned to our room late in the afternoon on our third day and our room had not been serviced. I notified the front desk and they did bring us fresh towels and toiletries and offered to make our room up for us, but at that point we felt we could just make the bed up and not worry with it. Needless to say, we were very disappointed that we were neglected on the third night of our stay.

Hilton Doubletree Financial District strikes an excellent balance of location, services, and price. Located just minutes away from the subway station, you can walk from the hotel to anywhere in Manhattan. Price wise the hotel is competitively priced with other four star hotels in the area. Services were excellent (though full disclaimer I happen to be Hilton Honor Gold and was upgraded to the second highest floor with a city view). The only downside is that the hotel is so popular, it had sold out the night before my stay which prevented an early check in.

I was a bit worries that staying in the financial district would be a bad location for sightseeing, etc, and about some of the reviews about no hot water, long elevator waits, etc, but gave it a shot.Check in was easy, given the hot cookie, up to the room which was the City View - as reviews here say, small but nicely done - the hotel felt modern and stylish, had everything needed, only issues were 1) to fit the room, the bed is short- we had to lay diagonal to fit (I'm 6' tall), 2) there was someone's dry cleaned shirt on our bed. No big deal, front desk came and got it, overall very happy, especially for the rate. View was ok, blocked somewhat by buildings but nice to be up high, saw 1 world trade center from the window, the river off to the left. AC is a bit noisy (somewhat of an issue), but hot water was fine.Location - this was outstanding. A couple blocks to the 4/5 express trains that can get you anywhere, but even better, easy walk to 9/11 Memorial, Statue of Liberty ferry/Battery Park, the Wall St bull is 2 blocks from the hotel, the NYSE an easy walk, the federal bldg (where George Washington took the first presidential oath is by the NYSE, Brooklyn Bridge (recommend the walk across it), then short train ride to times square, easy access to Little Italy (Angelo's was great), Greenwich Village, Central Park, a week pass for the trains is only $30 ride all you want). Also easy access to the riverfront - here's a tip, walk to South Street seaport area, there is a branch of the same discount tickets place TKTS that you will wait an hour at in Times Square - here it opens at 11 and no line, same discount tickets, times square doesnt evenopen until 2, so you get better choice and no wait.So was leaning toward high rating but on the second day we were awoken by the sound of dripping water. Looked and water was pouring down from the ceiling fan. Turns out toilet above supposedly overflowed, which means it was waste filled water. We called downstairs and engineering came right away but they said no available rooms to switch to, but called back in ten minutes with a room as people checked out (lucky it was AM when people leave and not middle of the night or we'd been stuck). We were moved a couple floors up and got a bigger room with a river view, so all in all they handled it about as well as possible, but combined with other reviews about hot water issues etc, i'd say the hotel is a bit like roulette - you're gambling that this retrofitted former office building's plumbing doesnt have issues. Also, the AC noise in the new room was pretty obnoxious, and any noise in the hall comes right in the room which happens too much in the AM.All in all it's too bad I can't give a higher rating. Hilton did decent design and I loved the location, and got a great deal, and niceish rooms, solid service - but toilet water through the ceiling, hall and AC noise, and elevator waits that weren't horrible but can be an issue make this simply an ok place. I would possibly stay here again if there was a good rate, but would be a bit nervous about these issues, and might opt to try something else rather than deal with the AC and hall noise and short beds and risk of plumbing issues. Too bad because otherwise promising.","Los Angeles, California","LAtourist123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",0,3.0

Every time someone opens a door on your floor or walks down the hall you will hear it and it will wake up. The ac in the room is also extremely loud and sounds like a hurricane hitting every time it turns on.To make things even worse the hotel management is extremely rude and unaccomodating.

The hotel does have a small bar and restaurant, but other than that not many options. The rooms are standard, maybe on the small side, but well maintained.

You can get pretty much anywhere you want to go from here. The view from the rooms with a view isn't really inspiring, but will give you a birds eye view of the city if you are on one of the higher floors. I suggest getting a higher floor for not just the view but because the elevators can get pretty packed in the mornings and by the time it gets to your middle floor it may already be full. The complimentary breakfast that comes with being a Hilton Honors member is pretty basic with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, fruit, cereal, pastries, etc. If you are a coffee drinker don't get your hopes up for refills. We've been to this hotel 3 times now and you pretty much need to tackle a waiter in order to get a refill. Basically, once you've been seated and they get you started you are on your own. The rooms are nice especially considering how tightly packed in they are. I haven't had problems with sound traveling all that much either. My only complaint would be to watch out in the shower becuase if someone in another room flushes you are going to get a quick scalding hot burst of water. Also, make sure to put the towel down in front of the shower because those door type showers are horrible at keeping water from leaking onto the floor.The check in staff are always very friendly, and we haven't had a problem with our bill on any of our visits.","Staten Island, New York","dont-tell-the-kids</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Staten Island, New York</strong>",39,4.0

I had called earlier (a week prior to our scheduled stay) to confirm arrangements to have 2 hotel rooms set aside for us on the same floor. The man who answered the phone assured me that this could be done upon check-in day even though I was hesitant about waiting until then when more rooms at the hotel would be spoken for. Upon arrival, there was no attempt to accommodate my request, nor sincere apologies rendered. My 90 year old mother was staying with my family of 4 and I had worked hard to ensure she would be comfortable and at ease being near to all. A change in plans was made and my 21 year old daughter and I stayed with her in a double room.

However, Priceline puts this in the 4 star category which this hotel most definitely is not. The location is great in the Wall Street Area. Front desk and bellhop staff are all helpful. The room was comfortable with 2 exceptions (no firm pillows and NO BATHROOM PRIVACY). The room has modern decor and they make great use of the smallish space BUT...the stylish sliding door to the bathroom just doesn't work! There is a huge gap so others can see, hear (and smell) everything. This is UNACCEPTABLE for any bathroom. Door semed to work properly but just did not fit. I have no idea if this was unique to my room or is an issue throughout but lets just say it made using the bathroom too ""open"" for my comfort. I stayed 2 nights. After the first night, the room wasn't cleaned until close to 5 pm (weird). Day 2 (checkout, housekeeping came knocking bright and early at 9 am (ugh). They came knocking again 2 more times despite the do not disturb sign...very annoyinhg and unprofessional as we were in serious need of sleep. There were a few other oddities that just bring this hotel below a 4 star. One, there was no refridgerator available which I needed for medication. Had to go to a different floor for ice instead. Second, there are no rollaways available. It would have been a tight squeeze for a rollaway but there was a possibility of an extra person and we could have made it work. Also, the pillows were uncomfortably soft. No such thing as a firm or foam pillow to be found. If you have back or neck issues and are picky about pillows, bring your own. The hotel TRIED to help but they just don't have any variety of pillows so I used the throw pillow from the room chair. Another weird thing was the telephone. The receiver is just for show. Had to use the base and speaker phone to call front desk, roomservice, etc which is not great if someone else is asleep. I definitely appreciated decent room lighting, the comfortable bed, variety of outlets and extra USB charging station. Closet and drawer space were good for smallish NYC hotel rooms. Location is excellent and in good proximity to both hogh end and casual dining. The TV worked great and WIFI works well (there is a daily WIFI charge which we got waived for being Hilton Honors members-- no hotel should charge for Wifi these days but this one does). Room service food was so-so but it came fast enough. Breaskfast in the room was WAY overpriced ($19 for an omelet?) but the OJ was fresh squeezed. I would not pay a high price to stay here but would stay here again for a great deal. Just be aware this is a 3 or 3+ star hotel and not a 4. It lacks all the smoothness and elegance of a proper 4 star hotel plus those extras, like a fridge in the room, ice machine on every floor, better pillows, upscale and ample toiletries, and proper communication with housekeeping staff (and courtesty to not wake people up).","Sparta, New Jersey","Lippylulu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sparta, New Jersey</strong>",58,3.0

The advantages: hotels are a bit cheaper, there are always new restaurants to try, happy hours are quite lively, and its easy to get to a variety of subways. Right outside of this Doubletree hotel, there are 3 different subway lines within one block which makes it very easy to get to all parts of NYC.

Well, that turned out to be a big mistake. What I did not realize is that the toilet in this room was not fully attached to the floor. Therefore, when the toilet was used, everything on the back of the toilet was thrown to the floor. The glass broke, and I had to deal with shards of glass on the floor.

The worst thing that has happened was on the last day of my stay when I arrived back to the hotel - several of my personal items have been missing. I have asked to speak to the hotel manager and on two occassions have ended up speaking to the receptionist. Maybe I am not worthy of hotel manager's time or the theft is not a reason enough to see a client. After waiting for over a half an hour for someone to show up, the receptionist and security guy have rocked up. The security guy has taken some notes on what was missing from the room and has suggested that it may just be that the store I have purchased the stuff hasn't packed these items. Out of 4 items missing, 2 were purchased as separate items in separate stores. The other two items arrived with me in a suitcase. After clarifying that, they have advised me that they will investigate the matter and get back to me.

The room was not big but it was good one person. Heater worked well as it was critical during the height of winter albeit it being a bit noisy. In fact, noise was the only gripe I have but it was bearable. The door is thin and the hallway narrow, so I can hear people walking pass, pulling their bags and my neighbour's door opening and closing. Every morning, I was woken up by the creaking and gurgling noise of water(people using their showers upstairs). It happened pretty early, around 6.30 am. Just as well, I was jet lagged and fell asleep shortly after the ritual morning 'noise'.That aside, location is fantastic with several subway lines a stone's throw away. The Staten Island ferries is 2 short blocks away as well. During the weekdays, little cafés, good carts, restaurants and taverns provide a good choice for food options. After 7 pm and weekends, the place is dead. It was ok gorgeous me as I like to get away from the madding crowd in the evening.2 bottles of water were provided daily and wifi is complimentary if you are a Hilton a Honors member. Around the corner is a Duane Reade where you scab get drinks, snacks and any toiletries... All in all a good stay.

I would advise against some of the top floors if you are bothered by noise from the fans on the roof. The hotel is tall and thin ie there are not many rooms on each floor. One small niggle is that the elevators (lifts!) can take a long time to come especially at about 7:30 or 8am. I find the front desk staff very helpful and friendly.

The next day, freezing water all day long. When we woke up, and when we came back in the night. We called the desk and the response was that in maybe half an hour it would be fixed. An hour later the water was cold, not freezing, but not ok for a bath - it was 2 degrees celsius outside, come on! With no other thing to do, cold shower it is...The following day the water was completely freezing, impossible to bait.

We did have a great time in NYC, but our experience in the DoubleTree, was rather sour, in which we stayed in two different rooms in two different floors (party of 5). First I must say that the hotel is very well located, near to a couple of subway stations and several landmarks, BUT, we had regrettable inconveniences at the Hotel.Lack of Hot water! We had a tight schedule to spend all the time we could in our activities, but on Jan 2 at 7:30 am there was no hot water in neither room or floor, the lady in the front desk first told me to “let it run a couple minutes” but after 20 mins and 3 different calls she send the engineer that didn’t do much difference 45 mins later and after all the other members of my family had to shower with cold water, they send me to an empty room to use the shower, in the 4th floor, the shower in this other room wasn’t clean ( I later inform it to front desk) and had not hot water, the same engineer of before went and after 15 mins. I could shower; we end up leaving the hotel at 9:30, losing two valuable hours. When we came back in the night, after the snow storm we wanted to get in the room and had a hot shower, again, no hot water, when I called front desk they told me to “let it run about 20 mins. full pressure in both the shower and the sink”, (what a waste of water). But I did, and only after 35 mins. there was hot water. Deplorable room service, in the 8 nights that we stayed we never had a really good room service cleaning, we found at night when we returned to the hotel that neither bathroom was really clean, room service only take the used towers, leave clean ones and spray some cleaning product a little bit around. Also we found our pajamas thrown in the floor like if they were rags or something when we actually leave it over the beds.The elevator thing is just plain wrong planning (44 floors and about 12 rooms per floor [approximated guess] and just 3 lifts??) during rush hours we rather climb down by stairs (we stayed in the 11 and 12 level) than to stay waiting more than 20 min to get to the lobby.But the worst of our experience at the DoubleTree was the HORRIBLE GUEST SERVICE by the hotel STAFF especially by the front desk staff,(but I feel obligated to say that the bell hops or doorman’s were really nice and help us out a lot). First, the lady that did our Check In didn’t told us that the hotel actually charge you 300 dollars PER room to cover “incidents”, usually, hotels around the world DO ask you to leave a voucher open with your credit card for incidental purposes but they never charge you (unless there IS an incident) and they tear it up if there is not incident at the moment you check out. I have a notification system from my bank that tells me whenever my card is charged, so after I saw the charge I confronted the people in the front desk but the lady that did my Check In wasn’t there, the response was that it was a hotel policy. Me and my party have travel many places, Europe, South America and many places in the USA and the Caribbean and we never had to deal with such policy.In other hand whenever we ask for something (information or when we complaint because of the lack of hot water or that the room’s phone didn’t work (that happened a lot also) )the response was in most cases unfriendly, hostile and in sometimes even aggressive. But the worst guest “service” happened the night we checked out, the lady that did our check out had the worst attitude toward us and he offended me and my family. My parents don´t speak much English but friendly people in service industries always finds a way to skip language barriers; my mom went to the front desk before the rest of us and ask the lady in the front desk to help her to find a taxi that drove us to the airport, she treat her with little or no respect and told her that SHE ONLY SPEAKS ENGLISH and that she couldn´t understand a thing my mother said; all of this in a very disrespectful tone that overpass the language barrier, then my mother ask her to do all the formalities for our Check Out, the hotel lady did understand that, and told her that we need to do nothing, because there was no incidents and everything was paid already (weird that she could understand that UHH?¡).When I went down my mother told me all that happen, and when I confront the lady she told me that she didn´t understand anything my mother said and that was all, I told her that I needed something that proves that we had no incidents and that if my money wasn´t returned to my credit card I could disputed, she told me that there was nothing she could give but a receipt of the payment that I did from local call I made from the room for 1 dollar and 70 cents, so I told her that it was very risky for us to leave the hotel and NY, without the money that they charge us in the Check In and no proof on NO incidents. She told me that it was a POLICY of EVERY hotel in the US to do such thing, and insisted that there was nothing else she could do, all of this in the most aggressive tone. I replied her that I worked years ago in a Hotel in the US and that they didn’t do that, her answer was “what hotel did you worked at” my answer was: that information is not important right now, but if you must know it was a golf resort in the middle east. Her answer was “ Well, a golf resort is quite different, and that’s our policy” I told her that she needed to dial down a notch and that this was not the way to treat guest’s.My mother told me that she would never return to that or any Hilton Hotel ever.All of the things that I just describe are ABSOLUTLY truth and I do NOT work or represent anything but myself and my family interests and we DO NOT belong to any Hotel or any competition , and I’m willing to back up my testimony to any Hilton representative if approach by them. We never expected that we experienced such experiences in a Hotel of such category.Absolutely horrible!","Barranquilla, Colombia","LCTC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barranquilla, Colombia</strong>",37,1.0

Just a minor oversight on the part of housekeeping. Also, I recommend purchasing tickets to the museums or other attractions from the concierge if able.

There is always a door man/member of staff on hand to point you in the right direction. The receptionist was quick and efficient and sent us on our way with a yummy, warm cookie.Room - we had a standard double (1510) and it was a perfect size, with a small wardrobe and plenty of other space to pop our belongings. The bathroom was more than adequate and for those who complained about the size of the shower.... you need to lose some weight! Both me and my husband could fit in! Great water pressure and the bed was ridiculously comfortable. Brilliant choice of channels on the TV and the heating could be tailored to your ideal temperature.Elevators/lift - I can only guess that it is the fatties again complaining about this! When we took the lift, you could bet a tenner that whoever was in it would be complaining about the wait and it got quite boring! The longest we waited was about 4 minutes and once you are in they are pretty quick. Unbelievable what frustrates some people.Location- perfect for us. So peaceful and Bowling Green and Whitehall subway stations are literally moments away. When you go from the hotel towards Whitehall stop off at the deli on the left hand side. I have no idea what it is called but they do the best roast beef sandwichs so grab one on your way to the train or the Staten Island ferry!New York is fabulous and if we go again we will book this hotel and also recommend to our friends!Whilst you are there go to Brooklyn Bridge followed by a pizza lunch at Grimaldis.

The restaurant is on the ground floor and we had the breakfast buffet one morning. It was the typical buffet with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, potatoes, cereals, and fruits. The wait staff is not overly friendly. It is convenient to the subway, ground zero, and battery park. There are a lot of different types of restaurants in the neighborhood with a pub right next door.

It took so long for it to be replaced that we were no longer hungry but we were charged the full price anyway.

I think there might be better options if a traveler took the time and energy to look for a better deal, but I didn't really have any complaints about my experience. I would not make the effort to stay there again, but if I did Priceline and it popped up, I wouldn't complain.Without further adieu...Positives:- The staff was lovely. The lobby is actually on the second floor, and while I had very limited interactions with them (during check-in and checkout, mostly), they were lovely - I even got a couple of Doubletree cookies for my bus ride home upon checkout. The staff at the front door was always friendly and helpful if I had any questions about the area.- The room was a reasonable size, especially for New York - king size bed, a nice chair, reasonably sized desk, etc. I thought it was clean, comfortable and did not show significant wear and tear. - I will always point this out as a positive (even though I expect it), because the opposite frustrates me, but the flat-screen TV actually had full-HD service (and movie channels to boot). While I didn't spend much time in the room, it's nice to be able to catch a game and not feel like it was 1993-quality on a lovely TV. The hotel Wi-Fi was actually reasonable as well, and I was able to use the full internet rather than just basic functions like email, etc., without any trouble.Negatives:- Though the room itself was nice, the bathroom was very small. It only had a stand-up shower, and the door to the bathroom and the door to the shower could not be opened at the same time, so keep that in mind if you're more than just a solo traveler and people may need to use the bathroom.- Unless you are traveling specifically for the Financial District area, the location is going to be a negative for many. Many restaurants and stores close early (or even closed entirely on weekends), rather than the ""Never Sleeps"" approach of the rest of the city. For example, there is a great pizza place across from the hotel - that was closed on the weekend during my trip. There is a decent amount of subway access, but you are in neither Midtown nor Brooklyn, and on weekends, they were repairing lines so certain stations were closed or had limited service. I never felt unsafe, but it feels far more deserted than many parts of New York once all of the tourist attractions have closed, so be wary of that as well.- The elevators in the hotel were relatively slow and cramped, which can be a problem if you have a lot of luggage or are trying to get somewhere in a hurry.As I said, this hotel wasn't designed to meet my needs - leisure traveler on the weekend with activities spread out all over both Manhattan and Brooklyn, but I went into it with the correct expectations and wasn't disappointed. For a business traveler, it's a pretty easy recommendation due simply to the service. For leisure, be cognizant of the location issues and you should be fine.","Silver Spring, Maryland","JF1414</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silver Spring, Maryland</strong>",15,4.0

But having said this, the hotel is most certainly not four star. Rooms are cramped and tiny, even by NYC standards, but are clean and bedding is quite comfortable. Very basic however, with no special amenities.Staff are extremely helpful and friendly, esp. the front door bellmen. Perhaps one of the stars in this rating is for the kind staff. Location is one I always regret, too far from everything. Hard to get cabs, not my favorite subway connection, not an enjoyable area to take a walk in, especially after hours.But the worst part of it all was the elevator fiasco. Even up to 15 min waits, with one or other of the elevators breaking down on any given day, and every elevator jammed full even after these crazy waits... Very frustrating. Elevator situation truly abysmal.I would not stay here again by choice for a variety of reasons, but if I did not have a choice, it would do. Expect 2.5 to 3 star and you won't be as disappointed.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Matars_Z</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",539,3.0

But there were a few minor issues that will give me pause the next time I visit the area.Positives: Great views, clean rooms, good decor.As for the issues I experienced, I somehow was charged twice for internet service, the toiletries - lotion and shampoo specifically - were already opened and apparently used by the previous guest, and the toilet was not attached to the floor very well. Also and when I called today to request copy of my final bill for my company's expense report, I was transferred to the billing department who failed to answer and neglected to respond to my voicemail after 3 hours; I'm still waiting for a callback. Finally, I had breakfast in the ground-level restaurant and was disappointed when I had to ask twice to have coffee refilled and then had to flag down the manager to get the check.Again, these are all minor complaints. Hopefully it's just a series of flukes, but nearly all were preventable. I'll be travelling to this area more frequently now for work and I have to admit that I'll think twice about staying here. This isn't what I come to expect from Doubletree.","Silver Spring, Maryland","JMichaelz02</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silver Spring, Maryland</strong>",9,3.0

It was dirty and breaking down. I do a lot of hotel booking for my job and I always expect a four star hotel to be clean and functioning...at the least. When we tried to check in the whole system was down. We waited for a long time eventually leaving so we wouldn't miss our ferry. When we got back that night the front desk representative seemed rude and extremely confused. We tried to purchase some water before heading up but now THAT system was down! When we got to our room the brochures and menu were covered in old food. DISGUSTING! Then the toilet wouldn't flush unless you pressed the button multiple times. The shower tiles were dirty with soap scum. While you were taking a shower the temperature would change, drastically, if the room beside us was flushing the toilet. (That shouldn't happen at a four star hotel!) We were pretty tired so we decided to just get in bed and ignore everything so far. Come to find out the tv is broken and we had to call up a tech! THEN when we pulled the covers over we found out both beds has NASTY stains all over the comforter. The stains looked like dried blood! Gross. I might have well stayed at a motel 6!When I told the front desk manager that morning he did nothing. Just jotted some notes and said they'd bring it up with the housekeeping manager. Very disappointed. That doesn't make my stay any less unpleasant. ",,AubreyIKit,3,1.0

The location of the hotel was good for my one day trip into NYC, while I enjoyed being placed on one of the high honors floors with an excellent view of Freedom Tower, I begin to regret the honor of being a Hilton Diamond when I had to wait almost 5 min for the elevator on more than one occasion.

At the hotel for 4 nights for work, location is fine for where I need to be, but there are other options availableNY hotel rooms are small, this is no exception. However I would expect it to deliver the basics like a proper shower, hot running water and some form of temperature contol in the roomThe bathroom does not have a bath/shower, its a wet room / access set-up: I did not ask for it, maybe all the rooms are equipped that way, but odd.No hot water. there was a problem on Monday night when I arrived. problem again Thursday morning - called around 5am to ask why no hot water and told the 'boiler was out', fixed in 30 to 45 minutes. Not ideal, but opportunity to go for a run while issue is fixed. got back and still no hot water..after another 30 minutes waiting had to give up and have a freezing cold shower, shave and off to work. back after 12 hours and things don't appear to have been fixed. To make matters worse, no communication from management at least recognising the issue - a voice message or note under the door .. - nothing! They are either unaware or don't care, either way a poor show.Note on room service: 18% service charge included in bill, however if you dont add a gratuity to the bill, then expect a scowl and slam on the way out. also not all the menu is availabe, especially the sweet stuff.oh and the air conditioning system seems to have two modes only - off and cold or on and noisy and room too hot","Woodford, United Kingdom","AamirA839</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Woodford, United Kingdom</strong>",52,1.0
