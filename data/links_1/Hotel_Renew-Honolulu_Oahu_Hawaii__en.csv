I called for rates, answered by Adrian Perez, hotel GM, but by the humble, courteous way he took my reservation I would never have guessed his position. We were graciously allowed an early check in, and upon entering the lobby, I immediately noticed the immaculate cleanliness as well as the stylish interior designs. The room furnishings were the same, everything being well-made, and in a sleek contemporary style. I was blown away by how white-glove clean the entire hotel was, and I felt protected by the crisp, sanitary air conditioning. Robes were hanging in our closet. The pool is beautiful, but will remain closed through the Coronavirus stay-home orders. The bed was perfect - heavy, firm, cool, and covered by quality high-thread linens. The few staff who we encountered were all full of Aloha Spirit and old-school hospitality. I thanked GM Adrian for the hotel experience, and it was really hard to do this review, because I wouldn't have minded keeping this gem hidden and nestled out of view.",,Grant96701,3,5.0

We were in town for a Dr. appt. for my pregnancy and didn't have the extra funds to book a fancy resort, but this felt like one! The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. They offer some fun, free ""wellness perks"" that are included as part of your resort free. I always pay the fee anyway, so it was nice to see something come of it. I had my Chinese New Year astrology reading, and a wellness beverage. It was fun and relaxing. The best part is the location to the beach. My 2-year old daughter could walk there without being carried, and the hotel provided free beach towels, beach toys, beach floaties, and beach chairs! Our daughter was in heaven :) Good restaurants nearby including Denny's and Wolfgang Puck to go (breakfast waffle highly recommended) and mac n' cheese for the little one. It's also right next to ABC store (practically located in their lobby). Only advice I would give is to just pay the extra $35 for parking. Otherwise it's $6/2-hours on the street and you end up paying most of the $35 anyway. We didn't pay it the last day and just parked at the zoo which was $3/2-hours but we weren't parking overnight so it made more sense. Loved the layout, cleanliness and comfort of the rooms. Have a great time! Thanks to Stephanie for the wellness perks!",,tescily14,0,4.0

It's less than a block away from the beach, and walking distance to so many restaurants, cafes, shops, etc. My room was clean and had a nice view of the ocean, from only the 5th floor. My housekeeper was great too - i was taking two showers a day on this trip and she left me extra towels and shampoo so I wouldn't run out! Of course not everything went perfectly smoothly: on the first morning the coffee bar attendant I guess was out sick so I mentioned to the front desk that I 'really' needed my morning coffee and they set up a self service coffee station in the lobby to accommodate us caffeine fiends. Great service on that front! I don't drink but they also had a decent group of folks partaking at the bar in the afternoons, which looked fun.As for the local area, I didn't venture too far from the hotel - had a dinner at momosan (a noodle & izakaya bar) one night which was amazing, also ventured over to the international market place and ate at paia fishmarket which was also really good - definitely better than I anticipated! Of course there are a ton of other options too which drew a lot of the tourists.finally I really enjoyed running around the local area for my daily workouts - if you go right out of the hotel up to the canal then west til you have to cross a bridge but instead head down back towards the beach and run back along the beachfront back to the hotel, that was about a 3.5 mile loop which was perfect for me. Also had plenty of opportunities to stop and snap some ig-worthy pics along the beach.overall it was a fantastic hotel with great service in a prime location. Definitely recommend and would return.","Santa Rosa, California","paulseo210</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Rosa, California</strong>",7,5.0

It was the calming environment I expected based on the reviews. The hotel has great midcentury ambiance and is nicely appointed for its boutique category. I would definitely stay there again.LOCATION: On the East end of Waikiki next to the zoo, the hotel is one block from the beach and 2 blocks from the park where there is ample space for yoga and running trails with a view of Diamond Head. Unfortunately it is requires navigating through various homeless camps, which can be uncomfortable for those not used to panhandling. The hotel also is on an alley that tends to be noisy, even at midnight so the earplugs I always pack were quite handy. Easy to walk to many restaurants and shops on the main streets.AMENTIES: I didn't make use of them as I was out at a conference all day, but there was a $25/day charge for beach towels (in very good condition and smelled clean), free yoga mat (and other exercise equipment) to borrow, as well as nearby yoga class, onsite tarot/horoscope readings and mini facials. Downstairs cafe had yummy looking snacks/food and beverages that appeared to be high quality. They will provide a disposable hot beverage cup with hot water if requested. Also is a water refill station that is extremely useful! Keep in mind there is no pool here or hot tub.ROOM: The decor was described, but more worn down than expected. The window shades were off track, which made opening and closing daily a bit of a pain. The thermostat/AC cover had broken rails, which decreased the overall ambiance. Lighting was sufficient, but the switches did not make sense. There are robes, no slippers, a safe, mini refrigerator, and seating for 1. Towels were clean and fluffy, and toiletries were excellent. The bathroom window did not shut completely, which allowed my hand washed items (quick dry work out clothes) to dry easily, but also gave a draft which was a bit chilly in Feb, and I imagine hot in the summer. Bed pillows were plentiful, but sheets had a very faint sour smell that perhaps most people would not notice (I unfortunately have super senses; not bad enough to request new ones).","San Francisco, California","SOtt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",18,4.0

I don’t see any reviews about the wellness side of this little gem. I am all into health and wellness but I would only consider it partly about your wellness. Yes there are exercise equipment available to bring into your room but there is not much room to move around. There is no gym, pool, or spa BUT There is a $15 day pass to another hotel’s gym when we are already paying the $25 daily resort fee. We shouldn’t have to PAY to go somewhere out of our way to work out comfortably. Not a good way to make up for something that you don’t have, I might as well should’ve stayed at that hotel where it may have been included in the resort fee. The staff is very friendly, cleanliness was good overall. Being that this is a wellness boutique hotel I found it interesting that there was a wellness concierge. I think her name was Tiffany. She sits near the elevator in a corner, very friendly and was very helpful with all of our questions and always smiling. Only thing I thought that was unusual is that as a concierge at a HOTEL there should be a desk? The wellness concierge is in a dark corner near the elevator in case you miss it. You won’t know that its a concierge until she comes up to you to greet you and let you know who they are, which was nice of her to do because I wouldn’t have known ONLY because...Nothing against the concierge but just the whole “Wellness concierge” at a “Wellness hotel” the set up looked very tacky being that she only had a table and 2 chairs. To be honest it looks kind of sad being it doesn’t look very professional looking like a normal concierge desk. I found it funny when another guest asked her when she was going to get a “real desk”. The owners or whoever is in charge should save up on getting a real desk and work on that if that’s what the hotel is supposedly all about. For the $25 amenity fee I wish that I would be taken in for the facial but it was so limited. HOW MANY People are staying in the hotel and we are all limited to one day and only 4 people out of how many are allowed to go. It kind of shows a reflection of how cheap management is. 4 out of 5 people would rather choose the facial than cleaning up the beach and doing yoga. There’s 2 days of yoga, there should be 2 days of facials instead. Overall staff was very nice which is what made up for some stuff. I would recommend people to stay here if its maybe just a couple nights. I thoughT that the water station was a plus. I don’t know what Shane’s position was but he was all over the place as the jack of all trades. Refrigerated items near the bar were overpriced thank god ABC store was right next door with way cheaper prices. Would I return? Maybe if I’m staying for 1 or 2 nights. I liked how close the beach was and the strip and a lot of restaurants all over the place. There could be a little bit of improvements but other than that its not bad.","Los Angeles, California","FortheloveofTRVL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",0,3.0

The deco is modern but don't be fooled by the fancy photos on the website. Many things in the room are in poor condition and it seems that they rushed to refurnish the room and forgot the details.

The decor is clean and simple, with a bit of an Asian feel. It is located one short block from the hubbub of Waikiki Beach, yet seems like a small oasis in the midst of the chaos. The lobby area is inviting and contains a small bar where you can enjoy a cocktail or grab a quick breakfast. The best thing about the Renew is its warm and friendly staff—everyone we came in contact with was exceptionally welcoming. The rooms include a mini fridge, but no coffee maker. One suggestion—it’s worth paying a bit extra to get an ocean view room on a higher floor (floors 6-9 are best). We actually stayed here twice during a recent trip (interspersed with a trip to the North Shore). Our first stay was on a lower floor and had no view; our second was on a high floor and had a gorgeous view. Unfortunately, like nearly all Honolulu hotels, there is a daily “resort fee”, which I feel should be rolled into the room rate. Nevertheless, they did provide nice beach towels, beach chairs, and daily newspapers. We enjoyed our stays at the Renew and would gladly return there in the future.","Fredericksburg, Virginia","T3241VPmartinw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fredericksburg, Virginia</strong>",5,5.0

While the rooms and lobby have had a refresh, the amenities advertised are actually a simple refrigerator with coconut water and the like, a few select hours for one day a week for 'astrology readings' or in-room facials (hopefully your stay lands on that day, otherwise you're out of luck) We received a letter describing the amenities, which include fitness equipment in your room, which was either stolen or non-existent. Our room had another guest's large bar of soap with hair on it in the shower. The sheets weren't a fitted sheet with a flat sheet but a flat sheet and a flat sheet, which we lifted to observe staining on the mattress coverlet, which I understand you can only bleach so much. The staff is hit-or-miss in terms of friendliness. The worst of all of this, is that I booked this hotel through my airline to receive miles, and on top of the room charges there is a $25/day 'amenity fee' which basically allows you the sparse schedule of activities and to borrow beach equipment. Not worth it, in my opinion. Our room looked out on hostel stairs, which was a privacy concern if you did not want your shades closed. If you don't mind boutique hotels for a higher price and really want to spend every day at the beach, this place is for you, otherwise, spend your money on somewhere that at least has a pool and some views.

One of the decorative panels fell off the wall while I was sleeping and onto me as I was laying in bed! My friend put soft drinks in the refrigerator in her room, and because the refrigerator was too cold, the cans actually exploded. The keys to the doors do not work well - I must have exchanged my room key 10 times and it still did not work. Finally because I complained about the panel falling on me, I met the manager. He was apologetic and fixed the panel (by going out and buying some glue to fix it) and fixed the room key. However, I must say, even though he apologized, that is not enough for me to ever stay there again nor recommend anyone stay at this hotel. I am a world traveler, and NEVER has anything ever fallen on me in a hotel and certainly a mere apology is not enough.Also, the desk staff, except for Shane, were a bust. They could care less about keys not working or being helpful. Many of the desk staff just seemed bored. Also, on my very last nite there, I ordered a happy hour drink and the bartender came running over and said I had a lobby credit of $50. I was curious about this credit, and Shane told me because of the package we booked, we received this credit (it sure would have been nice if someone had told me I had this credit upon check in and not just on the last night, since My stay was 7 nights!). Apparently this package also entitled me to 2 free drinks. So, in short, this hotel is not service oriented and things are falling apart!

I was also not happy when I came back to the room at 3pm after being at the beach for the afternoon only to find the same dirty towels in the ""dirty"" basket. One towel, per person, per day, doesn't cut it. And, although I should have checked when booking, I did not find a coffee maker in my room, nor a microwave.

So is good to avoid the excessive crowd. It seems to be freshly renovated, and it is clean. Another thing we appreciated is the water fountain in the hall.All this notwithstanding, the room was incredibly small to fit two people, and I am referring in particular to the following things:-the bed was for 1 person because we almost couldn't fit comfortably both of us without one staying on the edge.-In the bathroom you can barely turn, and there is no window, I am if a hole in the wall that you can never actually close can be defined window, then yes there is one.-If don't want to be wakened up by sunlight in the morning you'd better have worked out, because to close those things do not slide easily.What we also did not appreciate is that at check-in they charged us more than what booking mentioned, and only after we pointed this fact out they changed the price to the one mentioned in our reservation confirmation.Also, do not trust what's written in booking, they do not have breakfast, and we were extremely disappointed when we discovered it at the check-in.They only have valet parking for 35 (!) dollars a day (I get that in Waikiki parking is expensive, but 35 is a top-class resort fee)Overall summary: it is probably a bit cheaper and location in a more quiet spot than other hotels/resorts in Waikiki, but for the same price (or a tiny bit more) you can for sure get better.","Lausanne, Switzerland","TimB2993</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lausanne, Switzerland</strong>",16,2.0

For the two nights that I was there, there were bags of trash, I can only assume from housekeeping, left by an exit door near the elevator. This did not help the overall impression of the hotel. The bathroom wasn't very clean...there were missing baseboards...it just felt like if they took an extra minute and paid more attention to detail, then it would be really, really good.

I decided to try this place as I do love boutique hotels and this one seemed nice. Calling this place a luxury boutique hotel is a big stretch. It has the potential to be one based on the location, but currently is just is not. First of all, we checked in, left and went and got dinner and then came back. Our card said that our room was 603. We lug all of our stuff upstairs, go to room 603 and the key doesn't work and I can hear people inside talking - after going back downstaris, the guy told us that someone was ""pulling a prank"" and moving the room numbers (which are typing paper taped to the wall) and that the 603 was the room actually labeled 607. Then, we asked for a baby crib when we checked in, didn't get it. Called to ask, nothing. Finally, I went down to ask and the guy about the bed & he said ""oops, I sent it to the wrong room"" There was no pineapple juice or cold towel. They should just go ahead and remove that from the list of things included in the resort fee. The room looked like it has been remodeled, the furnishings were modern looking, but it looked like they did the whole room and left the tile and shower head, which were moldy and rusty. There are pieces of molding missing all over the place,. It just seems unfinished. The location of the hotel is very close to the beach, which is a plus.

They describe it on the website as a Holistic Wellness Boutique Retreat. I wouldn't come here expecting to be completely zen, pristine, and quiet. The walls were pretty thin; and, the wall a/c's are well, you know, wall a/c's. It is a 3 star hotel. So, do keep that in mind.

Another point or two----this is NOT a luxury class hotel. The resort fee is about $26 per day, in addition to the regular room charge. Most hotels in the area have a similar charge (as do hotels in Las Vegas etc.). I'm irritated every time I see that. It should be included in the room price quoted as it is MANDATORY.

Due to the refurbishment works, breakfast was a doggie bag each morning which comprises of a plain bagel, cream cheese, a hard boiled egg, an apple and cinnamin breakfast bar, a yogurt, a non fizzy canned guava juice drink and a small tub of fruit. It was the same thing every day for 6 days. The only thing that changed was the flavour of the yogurt. I got so bored of the breakfast towards the end of my stay. 2. No slippers provided. 3. When i booked the room, the resort fee was supposed to include free dvd rental. By the time i came to stay, that benefit was no longer there. 4. Whilst they provide beach chairs and umbrellas, the supplies are very limited. They ran out of umbrellas when i was there.","London, United Kingdom","Denise Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",49,4.0

First, lets start with the positives:-Fantastic Location a few hundred feet from the beach and close to a few places to eat-Not directly on the Main Street-Free Wifi-Free breakfast (it is not much, just some pastries and juice, but it is something)-Free Beach Amenities (Beach Towels, Chairs, Snorkel Gear, Boogie Boards)-Free water, coffee and tea in the lobby 24/7-Clean EnoughNow the Cons: The hotel was undergoing major construction during our stay so that is a major part of the following:-We tried to check in early, the front desk associate said she would try to get us in right away,,,ended up waiting almost 5 hours-Did not get the promised Pineapple Juice and Cold towels upon arrival-We only got the promised breakfast one day due to construction on the following days (They did give us a brown bagged breakfast, but it was not the same quality)-The walls are paper thin, I could hear all the noise from not only the construction on the hotel, but the construction on the street as well, music form the neighboring hotel-The rooms are in pretty bad disrepair. The pain was peeling, furniture all scuffed up, cracks in sink and tubs. They even had a wooden cover for the air-conditioning unit that was held together with duct-tape. It ended up falling on me and left a small bruise.-The TV is sort of small-Customer Shrive was hit and miss. Sometimes we got the things we requested right away, other times it took a few hoursOverall I would not recommend this hotel. yes the price is amazing, but you get what you pay for, It was not terrible, but I was disappointed in my stay.","Santa Clarita, California","jonasfan18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Clarita, California</strong>",0,3.0

The lack of pool is a deal breaker for a lot of people, so if you need a pool, it's probably not the place for you. For me, if a hotel is within a short walk from the ocean, who needs a pool? I'd rather be at the beach. Hotel Renew is actually affordable - especially for people who have dogs. I've been to a bunch of hotels that accept pets across the mainland, but this hotel doesn't just accept pets - it's pet friendly. When I checked into my room I found a bed and water/food dishes for my service dog. I've neverrrr had a hotel do that before, it was so sweet. There's breakfast, not vegan friendly, but it's a nice option. There is always coffee and infused water in the lobby.

I am a fan of boutique hotels and Renew was no exception. Rooms are clean and appears to be renovated which freshens it up. The staff were all excellent, super friendly and efficient, and it was a pleasure to stay here.The location is the absolute star of this place, it's situated right at the end of Waikiki ( goes straight into the heart of downtown) and located right across the beach. It was nice to explore around, eat, go back to the room to take a nap and continue wandering around again. Two of our fav. restaurants we discovered was Tikis Grill & Bar next door (reserve ahead for rail seating at the patio and watch the sunset!) and Arancino di Mare (try the Carbonara if you like pasta!). The zoo is also just a few blocks away. The complimentary breakfast was always a nice welcome in the morning to add needed fuel. Pastries and drinks to help yourself and bring back to your room. A few things I noted and wanted to share while I was there for 5 nights:- Our room, on the lower floor, faces a scooter rental and it can be noisy in the morning. Combined with the A/C which is an older model, light sleepers might be bothered by the sounds. Fortunately, I'm a mid-range sleeper and slept well, the temperature was good and the bed comfortable. - I saw 3 or 4 tiny ants on my side of the night table sporadically throughout my time there. They were harmless enough that I didn't bother informing housekeeping, but i made sure to keep my cup sealed and food locked away.- The water pressure for the shower was pretty bad on some nights and morning. Not a deal breaker for me, but good water pressure can be a bonus for some travelers.Overall, great value for the room and location (Waikiki is expensive place to book a room) and I would both recommend and return to this location when I visit Oahu again!",Vancouver,"Pinkcaviar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver</strong>",33,4.0

It is a shame as our room had an ocean view but no full length window so you had to stand to see it and there was only one chair for two people so one of us had to sit on the bed when in the room. Reception seemed pleasant but we would not say overly helpful. They need to sort the quality of the breakfast as the hard boiled eggs were overcooked (like stick to the top of your mouth dry) and the scones, pastries etc were stale and dry 4 days out of the 6. Hotel Renew you need to address this issue sooner rather than later. The breakfast did have sugary cereals but the porridge was good. It soon wore thin eating white stale bread products, maybe some brown bread and fresh fruit could be considered to be in the breakfast in the future. Were pleased they had tea, fresh water and coffee avail all day. It is situated in a really great location with The tiki bar and shops very close and they provided beach towels as you needed them. Remember it is a pet hotel so one night we had a whining barking dog for a couple of hours....but that was the only night.

The location is perfect on a side street off Kalakaua-the main drag.

It provides all mod cons you look for on your vacation. The room is well designed and specious enough for two people, the bed is very comfy.The staff is friendly, very attentive and the hotel is well maintained.Your booking comes with a complementary breakfast. This is unfortunately the weak component of the deal, as the breakfast is somewhat disappointing-a very small range of rather ordinary foods.When you want to go to the closest beach it's only a 3 min walk.

You don't need one as section of the ocean close to the beach is protected by a sea wall, so it creates a fantastic natural pool.

I live on Oahu and after my first time staying at Hotel Renew about seven years ago, I've used it as my go to spot when I get the urge to spend a weekend in Waikiki. I noticed a downturn in quality after my last stay which was in August 2017. Not enough to prevent me from returning but after my most recent stay, I will not ever book at the hotel again. It started with a relatively cold reception upon check in. I was looking forward to the cold towel upon check in but it was not offered on this stay. The receptionist was just short tempered and not friendly. Upon entering the room, there was an odd smell. Not enough to request a new room but enough to notice as slightly offensive. The bathroom was not cleaned well as it looked like ""water"" marks around the toilet. The shower doors were both jammed or off track and would not close as hard as I tried so we had to shower with the door open. Even after all of this, I would have given the hotel a 3 star rating but what happened next made me decide I would never stay here again. About 20 minutes before I departed the room, I was using the sink in the bathroom when I noticed a fast and heavy dripping from the ventilation duct above the sink. It increased in pace to a slight steady flow. It soaked my toiletry kit with all of my items inside. When I went to remove it, I noticed an odor, and I smelled the water and it had the odor of sewage. I quickly placed my toiletry kit in a plastic bad and ended up throwing several items away and washed the bag itself. If I wasn't so close to checking out, I would have immediately called the front desk. I washed my hands and left the room to check out. It was the same receptionist who provided the cold reception the day prior. She began to go over the room charges and I interrupted her to tell her about the foul smelling water leaking in the bathroom. She responded with ""OK, I'll call maintenance and get someone to check on it"". No apology, no offer to comp something like parking. Thanks for fixing that on my way out.

Also never received the fruit juice and towel on check in that is supposed to be part of this.- Bathroom lighting pretty dim- No tea making facilities in the room - only a coffee machine- Maid service not excellent, didn't replenish toiletries or towels even though they were dirty- Air con not great, only cooled half the room.Overall this was a good base for a few days in the city before we headed to the North Shore.

Just enough to get you going in the morning before an early lunch. we wanted to leave early one day to go to Diamond Head and the breakfast attendant gave us plenty of pastries in a ziplock bag to go!it's not a big hotel - only 72 rooms on 8 floors. No pool or exercise equipment but not necessary. The staff was very friendly & helpful. Shout out to Grace at the front desk.

We chose this hotel for price and location, at the eastern edge of Waikiki, given how expensive the brand name resorts are in Honolulu during peak season. We really liked the location, as we had a car, and it was easy to get to and from, without getting stuck in traffic. The hotel reception was very friendly and gave great suggestions. Loved the goldfish fountain/feature in the lobby. The room was neat, contemporary and stylish. We chose a room with a city view, but the view was still interesting. Nice in-room amenities. The continental breakfast buffet had good choices: hard boiled eggs, pastries, fruit, good coffee and guava juice. The waiter at the breakfast bar was very friendly and helpful. Seating is a bit limited but you can also take breakfast back to your room. A special shout out to the valet service; they were really exceptional. They were so friendly and helpful with our bags; and we never had to wait for the car. Really outstanding. We would stay here again. And, although we concentrated on exploring the island and visiting Pearl Harbor, the hotel is just half a block from a sheltered part of Waikiki - very easy access to the beach. Oh, and despite being close to Waikiki, we slept well and were never disturbed by street noise, or sounds from adjacent rooms.","Boston, Massachusetts","southendgirlfriend</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",47,4.0

This was our second visit to the Hotel Renew. The transition to the new management company was apparently more than a little rough with an almost a total change in hotel staff, except for the maids. Having been involved in several major transitions in the corporate world, I was perhaps a bit more understanding of the situation. David was very good in his handling of this very delicate situation. It was obvious he was empowered to make every attempt to solve the serious problem. The new manager was initially a bit cold but warmed up during the week we were at the hotel. The problem was solved by us accepting one night in a tired room at a reduced rate and by management adding another amenity to our stay. The staff transferred all of our belongings to a very good ocean view room while we were out and about enjoying Waikiki. All in all, our visit was very good and we will return. All of the staff went out of their way to make our visit as pleasant as could be. The continental breakfast was quite sufficient to begin the day.

That happens. But, when we raised our concerns with the hotel manager, we were completely brushed off. So we then called then general manager, and didn't even get a call back!! This left me with the impression that guests really don't matter to them, and proved to me what we saw first hand for our four day stay- they are there to squeeze every penny out of their customer, and value is not important to them.Our main concerns were: awful breakfast experience, offensive resort/""boutique"" fee which includes genuinely broken or useless items, and an excessive parking fee on top of that. Resort Fee: It's not a resort. No justification for it at all!! The joke is- they know it! They call it an amenity fee at times, and a “boutique fee” at times! It is ridiculous, and it is offensive to the customer! This is a widespread problem and not exclusive to Renew. But, at this hotel it is a particularly nasty joke! Not only do they not have a resort, they barely have a hotel!No pool. No gym. No sauna. No hot tub. No restaurant. No activities or recreation. No business center (a computer or two in the cramped reception area that does triple duty as a dining room and waiting area as well). No views. No ""grounds""/ property to explore or stretch your legs around. Its an apartment building with an awful lobby.They include their breakfast as part of the fee.... and It is awful. Nothing warm. Unappetizing baked goods. And instead of having the server who is present make omelettes or waffles or something fresh for the guests, he makes mixed drinks for steep prices so they can find a way to profit more on the ""free breakfast"".I found the breakfast to be an awful event as everyone has to scramble for the very few actual seats! (there are literally about six seats in the miniature breakfast space) 2 of the 4 nights We were there we had NO SEATS! People were siting in the lobby, out the front door on the street, or carried food back up to their rooms! IF the breakfast was decent... if they gave you something decent to eat and an actual seat.... then the resort fee would be palatable because a nice free breakfast is something of value at a hotel. But this was a joke!!Worst of all- they don't include something actually useful in the fee like parking- they charge over $30/ day ON TOP of the amenity fee!! There's a lot one block away that charges $1/hr which is a much better deal. Plus there is often free street parking. Couldn't they have at least matched the price of the parking lot one block away to make customers feel like they are not being taken advantage of?Their ABSURD list of amenities includes things we absolutely did not get including a newspaper daily, and the “Idapt charge and docking station” (yes they have the GAUL to charge you for a plug for your devices)- the best part- IT DID NOT WORK WHEN WE TRIED TO USE IT- it was broken! (another item the manger could care less about).They round off their list of “amenities” with the cold towel they hand you on check in, a “mobile concierge” which they never explained to us and I haven't got a clue what it is, free local calls (which is useless to anyone traveling domestically), the tea they have set up in the lobby, and the “aroma” they put in the room (an oil diffuser). This is a list of things that should absolutely be free in any “nice” hotel you go to. The one and only thing that was useful on the list was the wifi, and that too should be a free service (and increasingly it is at most hotels).Listen- the only reason people are staying here is because of the location. And yes- it is close to the beach and the heart of Honolulu. But, there are little to no decent views, and you may as well stay at one of the resorts a block closer. I wish I had selected one of the larger properties with more services/ amenities/ activities/ etc. At least a gym & pool. I don’t think I’d have found a resort fee quite as offensive if more was provided to me. This was a tiny hotel, with a cramped lobby/business center/breakfast area (all in a few square feet)- and your room. Period. And again- the manager didn’t address a single problem or concern I had. This, after not getting back to me in a timely manner (I left numerous messages for him).Then I called the GM and he/she was worse! I didn't even get a call back after leaving a voicemail!!It's a shame because the rest of the staff, minus the awful management, were extremely nice and helpful. More than one employee was quite nice to my wife & I. I just wish their superiors had their level of tact, customer service, and care for their guests.

The room was nice and clean, bed comfortable, and the a/c worked great, maybe even a little too well. The water and granola bars in the lobby kept us energized when we were coming and going.

We had to put the ac on a continuous fan to block out some of the noise.Additionally, the hotel makes a big deal about the lighting. We found it always too dark. You couldn't read, the bathroom was very dark (bright lights around the mirror, no lights in the shower) yet at the same time there is a frosted glass wall between the bathroom and the bedroom so if you turned on a light at night the whole bedroom lit up.

I would like to especially thank Rachel who had the biggest smile on her face throughout all of the long hours she worked, and actually remembered what I had planned for everyday.

Just be aware, taxes for the rental car will run about $72. So, it's not totally free, but obviously a deal for the 8 days we stayed.We chose an ocean facing room with king size bed. The bed and pillows were great. We slept like babies. Not sure if it was because we were wiped out every day or if it was really that comfortable, but either way, we slept well.Breakfast is ""continental,"" which translates to boiled eggs, some light pastries, dry cereal, and fresh fruit. It is good for a morning, maybe 2, but after that we found ourselves paying for breakfast. In Hawaii, breakfast can be the most expensive meal of the day per portion. That's because nearly everything required for breakfast is brought from the mainland. If you are attempting Hawaii on a budget, and noticed the included breakfast, just be aware of this info.Facilities are lacking here. This means, if you need to do laundry, you'll have to find someplace else to do it. The staff said there is a laundrymat down the road (it was quite a hike). We opted to pack a backpack and take a stoll next door to the 3rd floor of the Marriot. If you need to do laundry, they have a laundrymat. It's $3.25 to wash a load and same to dry. Get your detergent at the ABC store. It's only .99 versus inside the laundrymat.The housekeeping staff did an ok job. Not always ""on point"" but did well enough.The hotel staff and valet, they were great. Super friendly people at all hours. Just a great group of people, and always willing to help.The biggest drawback is the lack of balconies. I used to live in Hawaii and figured it was no big deal since we were so close to the beach, but I was wrong. Having that little bit of fresh air and the sound of the ocean would have made this a fantastic hotel. It's a real drawback to not have the sound and smell of the island available. The windows do not open. So that's out as well.Nonetheless, this hotel was a good value for the money. For a comparable price, we might have stayed at the sister hotel right next door for the balcony.Also, the sister hotel ""Aston of Waikiki"" has a restaurant called Tikis Bar & Grill. Absolutely awesome food and atmosphere. We ate there several times. Definitely go try it. Killer food.",,John L,3,5.0

Despite a couple of unfair negative reviews I decided on the Renew, as it was closer to the beach and had breakfast included. It's not often I book somewhere without either a pool or a gym, but I'm so glad I did. Having already experienced exceptional levels of service and hospitality at the various places we'd visited so far during our trip, I was super impressed from the outset with the Hotel Renew. Sarah checked us in, and she welcomed us as warmly as if we were old friends. The check-in process was smooth, and the pineapple juice and cold towel was a nice touch. We even got to choose a reed diffuser scent for our room, which was brought up to us along with a congratulatory bottle of fizzy wine and some chocolates. The beach is really close to the Hotel Renew, you can literally see it from just outside the front door and it's less than 2 minute's walk. If it weren't for the hotel next door being in the way then the Renew would be a beachfront property. Other good points about the Renew include a free DVD rental service, with quite a few new releases, which you can play on the Playstation 3 that's in your room! Also, free lending of beach towels, mats and collapsible chairs, and free tea and coffee in the lobby. The breakfast, while not extensive, was very welcome. We'd spent the last nine days at other places having to go out each morning in search of food, shelling out a fortune, so it was nice to be able to wander downstairs for some fruit, hard boiled eggs and a selection of pastries and muffins. Our room was clean and very spacious, with a huge, comfortable bed. The shower was pretty good, the blinds keep out the light very well, and the lighting controls next to the bed are convenient. The WiFi is good too. Nowhere is perfect, and the Hotel Renew is no exception. Breakfast is served in the bar area, which is just part of the open plan lobby, so it can be difficult to find somewhere to sit. The elevators are quite slow. On check-in we were given a half-price cocktail voucher for the hotel's bar but, despite various drink theme nights being advertised on notices in the elevators, the bar isn't staffed all the time. I get why, because the hotel is small and it doesn't really have a bar scene like you'd typically find in larger places, but we did try to use our vouchers a couple of times and were unsuccessful as there was nobody around. So we settled for a cup of free lobby tea instead. That's pretty much it for the negatives at the Renew. It's a superb little hotel; excellent value, great location, and the staff really are fantastic. Sarah, in particular, was awesome. With her seemingly unwavering enthusiasm he's probably the friendliest and most helpful hotel employee we've ever encountered. We absolutely would not hesitate to stay at the Hotel Renew again if we ever find ourselves back in Waikiki.","Bishops Stortford, United Kingdom","fleckers167</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bishops Stortford, United Kingdom</strong>",23,5.0

We stayed at Hotel Renew for 3 nights and then moved to another hotel outside of Honolulu (which we could not book for our entire visit). It was nice to spend 4 days at Waikiki beach and Hotel Renew proved to be an excellent location. We did not pick up a rental vehicle for use while at Hotel Renew as we could either walk or take a bus to sites we wanted to see during our stay. It was only a couple of minutes from the lobby door to the beach and a very nice walk to restaurants and shopping in the Waikiki beach area. Short bus ride to Diamond Head and only a few minutes from the Honolulu Zoo. The hotel staff were excellent, always helpful and offering assistance. Rooms were nice even though I did not pay for a 'view', it was easy to find a nearby restaurant or bar to enjoy the views. Continental breakfast was good, coffee, tea, fresh juice was excellent, cereals, variety of baked goods, boiled eggs and fresh fruit. More than enough to start the day. Also convenient that they had beach chairs, matts for use when needed. Wasn't too sure about the scents they provide as some were strong, but there was a one subtle scent available.

Smaller/inexpensive hotel...So rooms and hallways are small and spare. No pool or fitness center. That is expected for a smaller boutique hotel at these prices. Here's what gives the hotel it's excellent ratings - the extras...cool scented towels and fresh pineapple juice upon reception. Aroma therapy in the room. That means when you're out all day and return exhausted...your room smells like a plush day spa. Location puts you in walking distance of most anything in Waikiki. One block from beach.

You are not in the middle of the bustle of all the shoppers, and you can easily walk less than a block to a nice area of the beach for swimming. Also, the included continental breakfast was a great addition, especially because of the fresh fruit and juice that was provided daily. The neighboring ABC store is a handy spot for drinks and snacks, too.

Rooms are quite small, almost NYC small; nice furnishings with some rough edges in a hotel that is getting close to needing a bit of a refit. Still, very clean. Best thing about the place is the staff--amazingly friendly, from the front desk folks to the guys who park the cars. Breakfast is a lesson for all hotels that want to serve a simple morning meal: Some good-quality cereals, one hand-made juice that's awesome, fresh fruit, basic but seemingly local or house-made pastries, and really, really good coffee. Much higher quality than the typical plastic-packaged junk at many places, but free. Good access to the upper Waikiki beach, a block away, and easy walking distance to the whole strip. One thing: If you are on the back side, there seems to be some sort of morning garbage truck gathering right under the hotel, which gets noisy.

There are no words to truly describe not only the gorgeous interiors full of architectural details. Attention to detail....a specialty at Hotel Renew. The interiors are sleek & modern yet comfortable. The bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in at a hotel. There's even an umbrella hanging in the entrance hall to your room in case you'd like to use one! When you check in you not only receive a glass of chilled pineapple juice & a chilled towel scented with lime & ginger but you are also encouraged to choose a signature room scent. I chose the vanilla. Minutes after I arrived in my room Rey brought the essential oil reed diffuser to my room & two boxes of gorgeous Belgium chocolates as well as the sweetest, HANDWRITTEN, welcome & birthday card. Attention to detail!Breakfast is lovely in the lobby/bar area. Fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, pastries, cereal, coffee, tea etc. In evenings the bar serves wine, beer & great cocktails. The hotel is barely one block off the beach-directly behind the Aston Waikiki. The hotel provides beach gear: grass mats, towels and chairs. Since the hotel is on the south end you are also only one blockover from Queen Kapiolani park. Beautiful place to walk & I prefer the beaches here away from the crowds on Waikiki. If you are into working out a great walk or run is minutes away. Head over to the park and follow Monsarrat Ave up the hill. It changed into Diamond Head road. At the crest of the hill Kapiolani Community college is on your left. From there you have beautiful views to the west....looking back at Waikiki & Honolulu and you can see the eastern coast & Waialae/Kahala. But back to the hotel. The staff....amazing. You can always tell when people love their jobs & are treated well by their employer because they exhibit great pride in their organization & take great care of their customers. Paula, Grace, Rey & everyone else I'm forgetting thank you for such an amazing stay. I truly hated leaving you!This is a small boutique hotel. While I didn't have a great view from my room I knew that when I booked & was fine with it. Who stays in their room in Hawaii anyways??????? Being a small boutique hotel they are also able to offer exclusive extras like free admission to the Honolulu Museum of Arts- def worth a visit. You can walk (just over 3miles) or take Uber or the city bus. By the way the bus is great only $2.50 and there's a bus stop one block east of the hotel. I took the bus toPearl Harbor. Takes over an hour but you get a great tour of Honolulu on the way. FYI if going to Pearl Harbor go early as they only hand out 1300 tickets/day. Sorry for rambling. Bottom line I love this hotel. I would go back toWaikiki on my next trip to the islands for the sole purpose of staying at Hotel Renew. Again to all the staff mahalo.

Its location was also good being close to the beach and the main strip. However be aware that the rooms with balconies on the front of the hotel face the rear of another hotel and we were bothered a lot by the sound of glass bottles being emptied in large quantities at regular intervals into dustcarts and by the beeping noise from the reverse gear on the many delivery lorries that serviced the other hotel. ( I understand there might be a safety issue but why can't the driver turn them off at night and early morning ?) The bed was small and against the windowsill. There was - as others have commented- a very strong smell of plastic which permeates the room and we suspect comes from the window blinds - but it is common throughout the other rooms - we were there for a wedding and others in our party had to move rooms to reduce the odour.  Breakfast did not start till 7.30 and we would have liked it a bit earlier - personal preference. it was all carbohydrates with only boiled eggs to leaven it so we ate out everyday. For Hawaii it was reasonably priced but to charge a resort fee of $25 per day is ludicrous. it is not a resort and we did not want to use any of the other facilities.

This trip was as a stop over en route to Denver and I was travelling with a friend.My travel agent found a little boutique hotel just 3 blocks away from my old haunt. Hotel Renew is in an amazing location, located on the Diamond Head end of Waikiki only half a block away from the famous beach. Some rooms have ocean views.The first thing we were met with was a huge ALOHA from the amazingly personable Rachel, who proved to be an absolute star for the duration of our stay! Always a big smile and full of helpful hints, she is a wonderful ambassador for the Hotel.The cooling hand towel and refreshing pineapple juice which awaited us in reception were a bonus!Our room wasn't huge but it wasn't tiny either! Well equipped, spotlessly clean and more than comfortable. The furnishings were modern and the accessories such as toiletries were wonderful! Great shower too and very comfortable beds. Each room has individual air conditioning controlsA continental breakfast is provided down stairs in the tiny tiny bar area. It comprises cereal fruit and pastries. Very nice but the bar area is so small it isn't really a great option unless you can score a seat or want to take the food back to your room.Whilst we thoroughly loved our time at the Hotel and my friend said that she would happily go back and stay with her husband, there were a couple of things that I missed.1. Only a small number of rooms have lanais. About 9 I think. Whilst this wasn't a major issue it was a bit frustrating if my friend was sleeping or having a rest as I had to either go out of the room or sit on the the bed - the ability to sit on the lanai and just enjoy Honolulu would have been a wonderful alternative.2. There is no pool. It never occurred to me that a Hotel in Honolulu wouldn't have a pool! Again, not a major issue but there were a lot of times in our 5 night stay that I would have loved to have sat around the pool had a swim and enjoyed the weather, rather than just sit in the room or wander Kalakeau Ave just because I didn't have anywhere in the Hotel to sit. (The hotel does provide beach towel which I utilised,)3. Upon check in you discover a $25 a day room fee which you pay on checkout. It covers good coffee in your room, the Wi Fi and the towels as well as, I assume, the breakfast. Whilst I didn't mind the fee, it wasn't optional and I would have preferred that it be added to the room rather than slugged it as a non optional extra. I felt that I had to pay the fee as my travelling companion didn't use any of the extras the fee covers.4. No restaurant. Again not a biggie as Honolulu is full of restaurants, but it does mean that you have to go out to eat, so if you are feeling tired or whatever and want to eat in, it's not going to happen.In summary a really great little Hotel, but I would not recommend it for families and not for a long stay - unless you don't want a pool, restaurant of a lanai. Maybe for an overnight stop it would be brilliant.","Canberra, Australia","FlissPrideaux</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",26,4.0

The lighting in the room was also very bad - no light in the entrance hall so you had to use your cell phone as a flashlight to see inside the closet & safe at night.The great location near Waikiki beach can be a drawback if you're not there for the beach - there's lots of street noise in the area. The AC will drown out a lot of it, but if you like to sleep in you'll likely find the street noise to be a problem. Other hotels nearby likely won't be much better unless you get a room on a higher floor.The breakfast had coffee (with soy milk available - not just milk & cream!), muffins, scones, fresh fruit, and cereal.Front desk staff were very friendly and the hotel has beach chairs and beach towels available at no charge.Only one of the 2 elevators was in service during our stay. That's not a big problem except that the stairs are useless - you can't get to the lobby unless you're willing to go through a fire door to the outside and then walk back in.

It was medium-size, but the space was clean, designed well and still very comfortable and functional for two adults and luggage. Actually, in addition to a mini fridge and safe, there was quite a bit of storage. We are split on whether we liked the different lighting settings. They didn't work consistently, but it wasn't a big deal. It may be less useful and more gimmick. On the downside, the room overlooked the hostel next door, where on two of three mornings there was police activity. The rest of the afternoon and night there was noise and yelling, so in addition to the disruption, it gave the impression of being in an unsafe neighborhood. That said, I would like to see a swing bar or slide bolt lock added to guest room doors as an additional security measure; they are commonly found in most hotels. The included continental breakfast was average and tended toward the sweet side. It included two kinds of granola, fruit, pastries, pineapple juice, a freshly made fruit/vegetable juice blend, hard-boiled eggs (sometimes), coffee and tea. There was usually one person staffing the bar-turned-breakfast stand and that person was always good about keeping food stocked and the bar clean. Seating was limited and sometimes guests moved to the lobby couch for more space. One of the other things included in the resort fee is use of the DVD rental machine in the lobby. Available movies were limited, though they tended to be fairly new releases, which was nice. We used it twice becausr it was so easy and convenient. For every disappointment we experienced at Hotel Renew, something unexpected balanced it out. For instance, we never received the expected welcome drink and fresh towel, but shortly after we got to our room, two small boxes of chocolates were delivered from management, along with a sweet birthday note. Additionally, staff friendliness varied greatly depending on the person and (sometimes) the day. We're all entitled to good and bad days, but again, everything seemed to balance out.

In my experience many boutique hotels are very modern, and kinda special. This is not the case with Renew. I found the hallways dark, the room a bit dark and in general not very modern at all. If boutique just means 'small', then yes that is correct.So about the room: nothing special. A bit old-fashioned, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong: it was very clean, bed was great, fairly big room, and I don't have any complaints. But it just felt a bit old fashioned.

Everyone from the valet to the front desk was very nice, personable and knowledgeable about the area. If i had a request they made there best effort to accommodate. The little things like having your car out front when they know you have to leave in the morning make this a great hotel. Also the bar at the hotel is small but is a nice respite from the other packed ones.

Kudos to them for recognizing that not everyone needs a large noisy bar to relax and enjoy life! Our bed was very comfy and the bathroom was well sized and user friendly.

No amenities and breakfast good enough to keep most guests from complaining. Barely. All in all, a forgettable place at a premium cost. And be sure you read the fine print when booking because you will pay more than the advertised nightly rate: a $25 daily hotel fee, literally because they hand you a warm washcloth the day you check in, offer beach towels, and daily cold cereal and fruit. Plus, a $25 daily parking fee if you have a car. I certainly would not have stayed at Hotel Renew if I realized the fine print pushed the price tag to $250 per night.

If you blink you'll miss it! Just like I did and I circled the block again and pulled up to the curb for valet. This hotel is located on the right hand side of Paoakalani Ave. Valet Only (25$/night). Located on the right after Aston Waikiki beach hotel. As soon as I entered it already calmed me down...dim lights, water feature and sophisticated decor, truthfully it looked felt like you walked into the lobby of a spa. The front desk person greeted me and gave me cold hand towels and fresh juice. She was friendly and efficient. This hotel is small in comparison to its huge neighbors like the Marriot across the street but it's really a gem. With only 9 floors total, its very unlikely you'll be kept up at night by partying neighbors and kids sports teams. The room was cozy, sleek and sophisticated. The lighting was really great you can control it from bed. It was clean and the bed was Very comfortable! Flat screen TV on the wall and amazing wifi speeds. Everything was done well in the room and I have no complaints. I choose the Urban view because I live in Hawaii and didn't need to see the ocean. I was in 407 and basically faced a parking lot and had no view but I was okay with that. I would really recommend this place for couples instead of large families because of the room size and ambiance is I think more geared for couples. I would definitely stay here again. If I was a couple visiting Hawaii then would probably upgrade to the ocean view. Keep in mind there is no balcony and the window is NOT a huge one so Ocean view will be really nice but don't expect that you'll be able to have drinks on the balcony.Pros:-Less than a block from the beach. They will provide you with towels and beach chairs.-they have complimentary aromatherapy for your room. You can choose a scent from the check in desk and they will deliver a oil diffuser to your room in a few minutes -great customer service for checking in and out, they did a good job of explaining everything-location is prime! Walking distance to many great restaurants in the area Arancino, Sansei, DK's etc also close to shopping in Kalakaua and Kuhio Ave. -If you too lazy to leave the room and just want to relax there is waikiki room service which will deliver to this hotel for 5.99$ delivery fee. I ordered from Sansei and it was amazing!-Although I paid a 25$ amenity fee I appreciated the free DVD rentals in the lobby with up to date movies and the really fast wifi in the room, Keurig in the room and free coffee in the lobby and free continental breakfast. (We missed breakfast because I couldn't get out of bed it was so comfortable)-Hotel was clean and the room was very comfortable with a sophisticated relaxing ambiance. The Bed is very comfortable.

The staff were wonderful and the location is pretty much perfect. The problem is that this place lacks some of the modern conveniences that hotel go-ers expect. First thing: there are no power outlets next to the bed. So to charge your phone (which you probably use as an alarm) you have to plug in on the other side of the room. No snooze mode for you. And of course if you want to use the hotel provided clock as an alarm, the same deal applies. (Caveat, if you want to go black ops, you can get to an outlet, but it does require pulling off a plate that is hidden under a nightstand)The location is perfect. Just off the main drag at Waikiki, its close enough to be in the hustle and bustle but far enough away to be quiet. You can walk to the beach with the hotel provided towels which was definitely a plus. Other items to note: the lanai is not anything special. Concrete platform off the edge of the building. It's not facing the water so it seems they have it just to say they have it. The view from our room was pretty great. There are others better in the area, but that was something that we really appreciated about the room. An parking is valet only at $25/day. A little steep for me but on par with the area. I liked the valet option and the guys who ran the vehicles were great. Finally the bar is basically non-existent. If you are picking a hotel and a bar-scene is a must, this is not your hotel. They have a happy hour, but the only time we saw bodies in the bar area was for the continental breakfast.

Last time in 2013 - back then, besides being part of Aston, had still proper boutique feel and features. We came back 3 years later just to be disappointed - everything that was good and boutique about it is gone - except the staff. Staff is still good, friendly and do everything they can to keep the boutique vibe - unfortunately management and management policies went a long way to kill it. Before - hotel was better priced with amazing feature (which was for me a selling point - access to the complimentary room to refresh after check out before going to the airport if flight was late) - this is all gone. All they offered now was 1/2 price room for couple of hours - pretty much exactly like any other hotel... Ok it is my fault I assumed, they kept it as it was absolutely brilliant idea that made a lot of difference, should've asked before booking... my bad (hence average not poor rating). So good things: - good location (as many other hotels in the area) - free dvd/blu ray rental (not so free its part of extra charge and it is age of streaming services...) - ok breakfast bad things: - not great room service (actually - we had to ask for toilet paper at front desk...yes seriously - ASK for TOILET paper in the hotel....) - extra 25$ 'resort fee' - so whenever you see the price per room add 25$ to it - makes it in line with all other hotels in the area - and they dont even have proper restaurant etc. - no more complimentary room/place to refresh after the checkout - that's the most disappointing about the hotel (but yeah my fault should have asked in advance)So is it worth it staying in the fake boutique hotel? Maybe just for the staff - they are mostly great. But, it is just another hotel with no boutique features whatsoever, and without even a single thing that would set this hotel apart from other places in the area. For me - it was just a massive disappointment - and I know we will stay somewhere else next time on Oahu and won't be recommending it to my friends as we did after last time here.

There's an umbrella on the wall (which thankfully we never needed). All the lights are on button switches which are laid out everywhere in the room. This made it really easy to turn the lights on and off. Overall a clean room with nice little touches. We had a city-view room which was fine. We didn't end up being indoors much. The bathroom was fairly small and the shower temperature was exceedingly difficult to control. Otherwise, there is an aromatherapy option where you can choose from 4 different scents and they'll bring it up to your room.There is free in-room wifi that is fairly speedy. There is also an in-room Playstation 3 that seconds as a blu-ray/DVD player.Service: Everyone was exceedingly nice and helpful throughout the hotel. Rest of the hotel: Continental breakfast is free each morning from 7-9:30am. It consists of small pastries, fresh fruit, granola with milk, and fresh-squeezed carrot/apple/orange juice as well as coffee. This is served at the small bar that I never really saw anyone at. You can pickup free beach chairs from the lobby, which is a great feature.Overall a solid hotel with nice perks and touches. It's not a hotel that is meant to steal your attention from the rest of Waikiki but was perfect for what we wanted.","Seattle, Washington","rbrychckn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",19,4.0

The staff is what makes this place great. Supervisor Jackie Minami and everyone you encounter is professional, competent, and super friendly and helpful. Our most frequent contact was with Rene. Donna Marie also makes a wonderful bartender. Note, while not touted on the hotel description, they can arrange airport shuttle service with notice at a fraction of the cost of a taxi.

The location is amazing and right off Waikiki Beach. From the moment you check in, it felt like we were being pampered. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted with pineapple juice and a cold lemongrass towel. Definitely felt amazing to have that cool towel after flying all day. We got into our room and it was very nicely laid out. Although my mom or daughter did not smell anything, I am currently 6 months pregnant and have the nose of a bloodhound. There was a slight musky smell in the room (probably from a past guest) but my pregnancy hormones and super sensitive nose could not handle it. The staff immediately found another room for us and their aroma concierge (you get to choose a blend of essential oils to diffuse in the room) was a great to relax us and made the room smell amazing!The breakfast is nice and simple with fresh fruit, freshly blended smoothies, coffee, cereal and sweets. The hotel is very modern and has a nice boutique feel. The best part of our stay was the staff especially Ronald and the sweet receptionist when we first checked in. Ronald, was my go to for good places to eat and visit. He always went above and beyond to help us out during our stay. He recommended Marukame Udon which is the best udon I have ever had. We even visited Hotel Renew the following week after our stay and the sweet receptionist and Ronald still remembered our names. It really made us feel so special, this is something that you cannot get at other hotels.

Small at only 9 floors, the rooms are also small but clean, modern and comfortable. They provide a light but nice complimentary continental breakfast with fresh made juice that's delicious. Perfect for get out and go. The best part of this place is the staff. Everyone from front desk to housekeeping to valet are super nice and helpful. They arranged a free Uber for my gal when they found out the shuttle for a local farmers market wasn't running anymore. All times of day and night they were pleasant and helpful. Also, if you have a car their valet service is very fast, unlike the nightmare next door at the Aston where it can take over 30 mins to get your car back.

This was amazing for us and not long after they delivered champagne, chocolates and a cute best wishes note to us as it was our honeymoon.This hotel was quite reasonably priced compared to the other hotels in waikiki. It is literally a 1-2 minute walk to the beach. Fantastic location with great staff who always went beyond to make us feel welcomed. There is a $25 boutique fee per day but this covers light breakfast, wifi, movie rentals and beach gear hire. The beds are super comfy and aircon works well. The balcony is quite spacious, the only thing i would suggest the hotel fix is the amount of lighting.

But luckily, the front desk was nice enough to let us check in when we arrived at 12pm. That was the best already, I had nothing to complaint about. So when the staff asked if it was our first time in Hawaii, then we said yes, it was our first time and its our Honeymoon. We travelled all the way from Hong Kong which was a long ride. I did not asked for any upgrades and when we were in the room, the staff brought us a bottle of champaign, small box of chocolates and the best was the front desk staff wrote us a card congratulating us. Thumbs up. Pros: - very close to the beach (2-3 min walk) or 5-8 mins walk to Waikiki beach- Shuttle bus ($2 USD) to Ala Moana shopping mall, but not directly in front the hotel, the bus stop is beside the hotel (10 steps away) - friendly staff (100%) - Comfy bed- Ps 3 in the room- Free rental movies and ps3 games- location I find it pretty good (not the best), so basically its the end of the tourist street (Kalakaua Avenue). So you can walk up on one side of the street and then walk back on the other side of the street, which it will cover everything. - Free Wifi (not the fastest speed, but it works, so can't complain- Good location for joining tours cause the pickup can be right beside the Hotel. Cons:- Rooms are way too dark - Rooms not in its perfect conditions- My room was 207 and it had a balcony, which I didn't use. During at night around 4am-530am, the garbage trucks are tooo loud..and will wake you up. Not a good side to be on. - The washroom's window are just glass shutters and there are gaps so mosquitoes were able to fly in.. So must close the door after using the washroom. If you aren't looking for a resort hotel, this is a hotel you should stay in. I'll recommend this hotel for couples only.

I kept coming back to Hotel Renew's site, and mid-December pulled the trigger and booked it for just over a week's stay.The price was right and the location was perfect. Located on a quieter corner, just a block off the beach and tucked about a block off from the zoo, the location was just close enough - but well away - from the mega-Waikiki hotel nonsense that lurks just a few blocks west. Walk-able if you want that, but you can just as easily walk east towards Diamond Head if you don't.It's a boutique hotel in that there are limited rooms and floors. I was on the 9th (top floor) facing the city/territory which was fine, as you're rarely in the room anyway. On that side, there's a few condos and hostels across the adjoining street. Other than typical city noise (Honolulu is a city) I didn't find it distracting. The room was spotless clean, modernly furnished, and had a slick lighting system. (though it did take me til the second day to touch the oddly located and labeled ""push me"" button.)The amenities are okay. Breakfast is on like clockwork every day, but it was identical every day. It's okay for a little starter coffee and fruit, but you'll want to explore the food scene available in the city. Most of the better/local restaurants are up Kapahulu, so if you want to steer clear of the touristy joints, that's easy to do with a short walk or car ride anywhere from the hotel up towards the H1.Beach gear (Chairs, mats, towels) are all available and in good shape. What stands out most was the staff. All were friendly and helpful, from the reception to the room attendants. I had a car, and the valets were fantastic, always accommodating and even anticipating my needs after the first couple days.I would come back here and stay at the Renew in a heartbeat.","Seattle, Washington","SeaGuyRon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",14,4.0

I'm never too concerned with the view as we aren't in the hotel that often, but the first morning starting at 5 or 6 am we heard chanting outside. It was the housekeepers on strike! No going back to sleep after that and was disappointing considering the price you pay for the rooms. Breakfast was ok. Very continental breakfast that got old after the first 2 days - some juice, a few rolls and muffins. Valet guys were awesome!

Why pay $450 a night for a room you are basically only sleeping in?Hotel Renew fitted the bill and turned out to be more than a place just to sleep. Rooms were reasonably priced, even the ocean view I had was just under $200 for the days I was there. It was just a block from the beach and surrounded by stores and restaurants in the area. Positive: Great location near restaurants and stores. Excellent staff. My room had a direct view of the beach and a balcony. The hotel is sandwiched between two larger hotels but because of a restaurant and pool at one of the hotels, Hotel Renew has some rooms that directly look over that area for a great view of the beach. Breakfast is fine with pastries, juice, fresh fruit, coffee and tea. Worked for me since I stuffed myself at other places for lunch and dinner. Valet parking was reasonable and I typically got my car within a few minutes. There is a small bar in the restaurant that I saw some people use in the evening. Negatives. Easily overlooked but the wifi was questionable. Wifi is big to me since I often do working vacations and the speed was slow. I frankly don’t understand in this day why hotels don’t invest in quality wifi. The layout of the room was also awkward for me. This may be totally a personal preference but the desk was near the front door and had no view of the TV. Also the room was dark even with the lights at full blast. I actually had to use the flash light on my iPhone to see in the closet and in certain places.Hotel Renew is a good pick.","Baltimore, Maryland","MarylandCT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, Maryland</strong>",25,4.0

When we arrived we were greeted by a friendly staff who presented us with a scented towel, juice and a choice of scents for our room. The overall feel of the hotel and staff is very welcoming. The rooms and bathroom are on the small side but well appointed and what we expected. We had one issue with our AC one day and notified the staff as we were leaving. Upon return it was fixed and we never had another issue with it. We found our bed to slightly slope on one side, as did the other couple in their room as well. My husband found a way to remedy the problem on his own so we did not make it an issue. We also had to ask for extra towels frequently as sometimes only 3 were left and there are 4 of us. They were always promptly brought to our room. The bath products are nice and often found at boutique hotels. There is a complimentary umbrella in the room that we found to be very helpful. We asked for extras many times and they were very accommodating. We also loved the beach towels and beach chairs that were provided whenever we needed them. The rooms and entire hotel was very clean and calming. The elevator is quick and we never had to wait on it. We ate breakfast one day and it was pastries and juices. The eating area is quite small. You can't beat the location of this hotel. You are 30 seconds from the beach and there are plenty of restaurants and shopping nearby. Right next door is an ABC store which is a local convenience store. Starbucks is right around the corner as well as a Jamba Juice, Subway and a Wolfgang Puck Express for quick eats. Right next door is also the area in which tour buses pickup and drop off. Very convenient if you book any tour.We really enjoyed our experience and would stay here again.

Our fridge was pooling with a bit of water so we mentioned it to front desk - a new fridge was put into place and kept our poke and beer nice and cool for the next few days. Nothing was too much trouble! When asked for more towels and a late checkout - it was always a warm yes and no problem. Room: It was big enough for the 4 of us and looked just like the photos. Yes the air-con may be a little noisy and too cold at times - but you can adjust the temperature easily. The hotel provides good quality shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion. The only thing I would like the hotel to know is the beds are on the softer side - my husband and friends couldn't sleep well.Parking: We didn't have to pay the $25 daily valet parking (in and out access included). We found plenty of parking just past the zoo every day (10-15 minute walk). Amenities included with $25 daily fee: beach mats, towels, simple breakfast (pastries, fruits, freshly squeezed carrot/Apple/orange juice, organic granola, coffee, tea)Location: the beach is less than 5 mins away. It's a 10-15 walk from the marine life conservation district in Waikiki - just outside the aquarium - saw lots of fish there!

This was our second and final hotel stay in Waikiki as we were heading back home. We arrived to the hotel earlier than the check-in time (around 11) and our room was not ready (totally understandable since check out time is 12). The lovely ladies at the front desk greeted us with refreshing pineapple juice and nice cool towels. Since the room was not ready we decided to go to lunch to kill some time, and were told that if the room is ready earlier we will get a phone call. As we were walking back from lunch we got the call (around 1 o'clock) that our room is ready! The room is very nice, clean, modern and has central air and a balcony! We were in room 801. A few minutes after our arrival we received a bottle of champagne and a very nice note from the hotel congratulating us on our anniversary. Overall, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Room is on the smaller side but that is fine since we did not spend much time there it was just overwhelming at times with our luggage ( as a side note, there's space under the bed to shove things under for extra walking space on the floor). Waikiki beach is a super tourist area and is rather nice. Realistically, you do not need a car unless you want to do your own excursions ( we really only went to Pearl Harbor). Shopping, dining, beach, zoo, and even Diamond Head trail is a walking distance (about 30 min walk - we took the bus back since it was raining ans it was super easy). I always appreciate a free continental breakfast and this one was nice. They had some pastries, fresh squeezed juice, fresh fruits and coffee. some unknown expenses: $25 a day for valet parking - you can try to look for a spot but its very hard with the amount of cars and cleaning. $25 a day for a resort fee - whatever you paid, you will be paying an extra $25 each day you stay there..

We had a standard queen bedroom. Room size was clean and pretty large with a little bar fridge. Air conditioning was freezing and always had this water dripping noise.

The location of the hotel is quite convenient as its just off the main Waikiki strip on the end closest to the Zoo and Diamond Head, there is also a trolley (bus) stop right in front of the hotel which makes getting up and down the Waikiki strip quite easy. The staff throughout the hotel were all very friendly and helpful with all our questions and bookings (for tours, care hire and shuttle bus transfers to the airport). You will need to pay a $25 USD amenities fee (on top of your room rate) for each day of your stay, which will cover your breakfast, beach towel/chair hires, dvd/ps3 game hires and a few other things. As my wife was pregnant, we took advantage of the dvd hires (pretty good range) most nights after coming back from dinner. A few opportunities we felt that hotel could improve on include: - Breakfast Times: The 7:30am-9:30am window where you could eat something downstairs is a little restrictive for people who get up early to do an early morning activity (such as a hike) or decide to have a little sleep in. Perhaps extending breakfast times to 6:30am-10:30am would be best.- Breakfast Range: The breakfast was OK (especially the fresh fruit salad), but the granola/museli from the dispensers were too sugary to eat. Would of been great to have a plain (sugarless) corn flakes or oatmeal option. - Water Pressure of Shower Heads: It wasn't 'terrible' but the water pressure when we had showers felt quite weak.- Noise of Aircon: Was a little loud at night when we slept. - Ocean View Room: We booked a premier ocean view king room and were placed onto a room on the 5th floor. There wasn't much of a view, so perhaps ask for a room on a higher level otherwise it doesn't make much sense to pay for a ocean view room as Renew is located behind the main Aston hotel. Overall, the positives definitely outweigh the opportunities and would definitely recommend for any couples and/or families looking for a nice little boutique hotel to stay at in Honolulu.","Sydney, Australia","XHuang</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",52,4.0

We stayed at Hotel Renew in Waikiki for 7 nights. The streets in Honolulu can get quite busy and noisy, hence an upper storey room like the one we had is recommended. Our room had a very good size, well equipped and there was a lovely lady, Tina, who serviced it every day, smiled to us all the time and made sure we had a great stay. Please pass on our thanks to her! It is great to meet people like that.The hotel is very near the beach, provides beach gear (towels and mats) to the guests, which was a great plus for us. They also provide a continental breakfast every day, which is great to have, although there is not a huge choice. All the staff was really nice and helpful. There is plenty of choice in terms of bars and restaurants around the hotel (we really liked the food at Tiki's Grill&Bar next door). We rented a car for a few days to drive to other beaches on the island and it was a great decision, Oahu is an amazing place.We thoroughly enjoyed our holiday and if we have the chance to go back to Hawaii for our anniversary, we would choose Hotel Renew again!","New London, Connecticut","Ralucaaaa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New London, Connecticut</strong>",9,5.0

Small, with shared amenities with the next door ""sister' hotels - Waikiki Beach Marriott and Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel, a little out of the way, and cheap. I was able to get a pretty good rate during off season and using AAA. The last time I visited, I stayed right in the middle of Waikiki and it was difficult to sleep because of all of the noise. I did not have that problem with the Hotel Renew. There are plenty of amenities offered, a (very) small bar downstairs, and it's just a short walk to the beach, bus stops, restaurants, etc. The beds were comfy and the room was decent for most rooms, but large for Honolulu :)Next time I visit Oahu, it'll be at the Hotel Renew.","Charleston, South Carolina","chartergirl64</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charleston, South Carolina</strong>",26,5.0

The service and attention to detail are amazing! Rena at the front desk greeted us with a refreshing beverage and lightly scented towelette to clear the mind of any hassles we may have encountered in our travels. After our seemless check-in, we went to our upgraded room with a partial ocean view. The room was top notch and had everything I hope for in a hotel room: clean, modern design with all the amenities. We had a comfortable king size bed, huge flat screen TV, & docking station for our iPhones. An additional feature I loved about our room was the spaciousness of the room. Many rooms in Waikiki leave me feeling cramped and in the 1980s, but not this place. I LOVED our room! We had a few minor hiccups with our bathroom (light bulb burned out and such) and the front of house staff was gracious in having the issues resolved immediately. They offered to move us, but like I said earlier I loved our room, so we chose not to move. Although they do not have a restaurant here, they do have a bar with a generous happy hour. Living in the islands, I do not typically have mai tais, but their's is worth stopping in for. Go see Amanda or Donna Marie and they will take good care of you!The customer service in this hotel is amazing. No matter who was at the Front Desk, they always greeted us upon our arrival and departure. Big Mahalo to all of them: Rena, Grace, Kealii and Lani! Additionally, they truly listen to your wants and needs. I had a special request regarding parking of an oversized vehicle. They not only honored our request, but they ensured a parking space was always available for us. Did I mention they have valet service? Those guys were awesome!! Overall, I couldn't ask for a better place to stay.

The staff spent some time figuring out the situation, after like an hour wait, they told us Hawaiian Airline agent booked the room but ended up cancelling to rebook because they found a cheaper price. Long story short, the staff was able to find us a room. I don't know who's fault it is but just a warning to anyone booking via Hawaiian Airline. Other than this drama, here's what I like/dislike about the hotel:Likes:- Great location, steps from the beach and bus station, convenient store just around the corner- relatively cheaper than most hotels in the area- friendly staffDislikes:- Room is very dark and dated. - The air con is very loud and smells moldy- The bathroom amenities has this cheap weird smell, and the bar of soup included just doesn't lather","Paradise, California","Bambooscent</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paradise, California</strong>",87,3.0

There were lots of convenience stores, eating places just a few steps away and we could have not asked for more.However what really, really impressed us was the hotel's staff, namely the front desk sweet girls and guys. They made our stay a very special one: there was never a ""no""or a ""maybe""whenever we asked for something.

Breakfast was good and as space was a little limited (although we could always get a seat if we chose to), we simply took ours back to our room to enjoy in comfort. We very rarely eat (or want) a large cooked breakfast so coffee, juice, fruit and pastries were filling enough and a nice start to the morning. All in all we had a very nice time in this hotel, staff were very friendly, rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. Only one teeny tiny thing to make it better, the man at reception told me I could turn down the air con on the actual unit which I attempted to do for about 10 minutes. Much later we found the controls were on the wall :( only minor, but annoying when you're freezing.

We also appreciated being at the Diamond Head end of Waikiki, close to Kapiolani Park and the less touristy restaurants on Kapahulu Ave. Our room was clean and comfortable, with a nice king-sized bed, Kurig coffee machine and refrigerator. The complimentary continental breakfast was also good, with a tasty selection of breads/pastries, cereal and fruit, along with juice, tea and coffee. I'd recommend a room facing south, away from the street (as we had) and consider paying a little extra for an ocean view room.

The renew tucked away just off the main thoroughfare but still only a 5 minute walk from the beach is a small respite from the hustle and bustle. It's adequately appointed and the rooms have been done up nicely. It's got everything you need and the staff were friendly and helpful. The ocean side rooms have a nice view to the main beach and the light settings the rooms have means you can set the mood day and night to take advantage of it. Large TVs equipped with the play station if your that way inclined or just need some down time from the cocktails and karaoke. While like anywhere in Waikiki it's not what you would consider cheap it's definitely affordable and compares well to other hotels. The best rate I was offered was calling up in the day which was a bit unfortunate considering I'd purchased in advance a 40% off rate on a booking site so be weary of that ... This was a common complaint at many hotels from those who had booked early. ,"Queenstown, New Zealand","markwilsonsouth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Queenstown, New Zealand</strong>",47,4.0

I had all my luggage, including a huge board bag around my back and I had just walked out of my hotel, having cancelled reservations for the entire length of my stay! I essentially had no place to go! Enter Angie at Hotel Renew's front desk. Super full of aloha, calm, upbeat and with a chilled glass of juice and a refreshing cloth, everything was taken care of! Which summarizes my entire trip! I spent time talking story with everyone from the maintenance guy (who worked on my sink, unexpectedly) to the front door guy to the cleaning staff and bar server and everyone went the extra mile to make me feel at home. In fact, not wanting to bother the maintenance guy, I left for awhile then returned and he mentioned I could request another room if I wanted. I joked that he could keep the diamond ring that must be plugging the sink all for himself that way and decided to change rooms. To my surprise, my room was upgraded and a few fees were waived! More than I could expect or wanted!I must state - I left the prior hotel because of a bug problem. I'm not a picky person. I have found several inexpensive hotels in Waikiki that are both clean, affordable and sit right near the beach. However, I draw the line at bugs and I realize Hawaii is tropical but when they're in the elevator, bathroom and room itself, I didn't want to bring them home in my luggage. Also to note - I was bumped from the airline and spent a day at a resort style hotel that sits on the beach after Hotel Renew. It was loud, busy, touristy and though it had alot to do, it was most definitely NOT relaxing nor was it as welcoming. Winner?

Once my apartment was packed up and I moved out, I booked a 10 day stay at Hotel Renew after some extensive research. Concierge: Rena at the front desk was so kind and professional when she originally booked my hotel room for me over the phone. I was delighted that I met her in person at the front desk when I checked in as well. She was able to get me a beautiful Ocean front King bed room at an affordable price! Upon check in, I got their famous lemongrass scented cool towel and a refreshing glass of pineapple juice. Valet: All of the valet gentlemen were speedy, friendly, and quick to park or get your car. Warren was the best! When I checked out of the hotel, he gave me a sweet box of chocolate covered macadamia nuts!Bar: 5:30-7:30 happy hour. Need I say more? But I will. The hotel's drinks are just perfect after a day of exploring, touring, and beaching. My favorites were the Modern Margarita and the Moscow Mule.Hotel Room: The room was absolutely beautiful with the ocean view, and sleek, modern furniture. The bathroom was very clean (which I'm very particular about at hotels). Being on the 8th floor, I wasn't bothered by the Kalakaua night noises at all. I could barely hear anything once I closed the sliding window covers. I was knocked out every night after some good food, drinks, and of course a super comfortable King bed. If you're looking for a chill night in, they have a Red Box-like DVD rental machine downstairs in the lobby with lots of good movie options. It was nice to be able to come back into my room with the sheets freshly made and towels folded by Tina, the nicest room service attendant!Overall, I was extremely happy with the hotel, the services by all of the employees and the convenience of the location, because it's so close to every restaurant, bar, and beach you want to be at! When I come back to visit Hawaii, I will definitely be staying here again.","New York City, New York","Jisun J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",4,5.0

It's more of an adult hotel. Some of the pros were: staff were very friendly, valet was very fast, small continental breakfast, balcony ocean view was pretty, room stayed nice and cold, had access to DVDs, nice happy hour and it was very close to the beach. They also had a deal for military where we didn't have to pay the amenity fee or parking. That was an awesome pro for us. The cons were: the room was very small including the bathroom, lighting wasn't very bright, no pool, balcony doesn't face the ocean in an ocean view room, you can see the ocean from the window but you can also see the top of the hotel next to us (which I have stayed at and loved) and continental breakfast was very limited. I have stayed at two other Aston hotels and I loved them. I liked this one for the deal we received. I think the staff and deal made it worth the smaller room and no pool. I would stay here again as long as it was just my husband and I. I think the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel is better if you are going with multiple people or a family.

Given the cost of the other hotels in the area and what they had to offer thank goodness we found this hotel. Though it does have the feel of a small boutique hotel they are not shy on their offerings. The hotel is one hotel off of Waikiki so to start you skip out on the noise of the beach and everyone shopping, but still remain steps away from the action. Upon arrival they greet you with a fresh towel and juice, which for us after being stuck in traffic hit the spot. They also give you a DVD/Playstation 3 rental card that we were not expecting. There is a machine in the lobby that you can rent anything from for free (player in the room is a playstation 3). The choices are very limited but they do offer new and current titles. Though we did not take advantage of it they also offer free beach gear to use for the day. Though I am not sure exactly what it includes. Unlike many of the other hotels in the area they do offer free breakfast, nothing major but it is enough to start your day. Rooms we very clean and the hotel felt new and updated. The only thing we did not care for was figuring out what to do when we got there. It was extremely busy on the street and if you blink you miss it, there is no parking (like most hotels in the area) and if the space in front is blocked by one of the many bus, trolleys or other public transport in the area be prepared for a loop around the block. Just park out front and a valet will help you out. Again, that was the only thing we did not care for but understand it is not their issue. Clean, new, tons of extras, steps away from the beach, shopping, food, zoo and aquarium... all of this at an extremely reasonable rate, how can you go wrong.","Upper Sandusky, Ohio","Julie K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Upper Sandusky, Ohio</strong>",6,5.0

In a market where everything is ""bigger is better"" Hotel Renew gave you the feeling that you were in a small, boutique hotel tucked away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. The location is great - Kuhio Beach just steps from the door, and all of the activities of Kalakaua moments away. I also really liked that you could get out of Waikiki easily by exiting either to Ala Wai Blvd., or up Kapahulu to the freeway. Oh, and just a five minute drive from Leonard's Malasadas!We had an ocean view room and it was great. Good space, lighting and amenities. If I stayed here again, I would ONLY consider an ocean view room on a high floor. The view for the non-ocean view rooms were not that good.A few minor drawbacks. None of the rooms had balconies. In Hawaii, the air is everything. The design of the hotel does not allow any of the rooms to have balconies. Secondly, the breakfast was really weak. I did not need a full breakfast spread, but the items served did not appeal, so we only had the coffee (oh, and the malasadas fresh from Leonard's.) Finally, the hotel has virtually no parking so all parking is valet. The guys were great in getting your car as fast as possible, but at times you had to wait as they retrieved a few cars ahead of you.The pricing/value was wonderful.

Probably the best part of this hotel. But the 4.5 out of 5 on Tripadvisor, and the pictures of the nice, modernized style of room, are completely out of the question and misleading. To give you a short description: this hotel cost us a grand for 4 nights and it was an updated dorm room at best! IF YOU ARE PAST BEING A COLLEGE STUDENT AND ARE A MID TWENTIES AND UP AND MIGHT STAY WITH A GIRL/BOYFRIEND, AVOID THIS PLACE. It is a couple steps above a European (or American, whatever) Hostel. Seriously. The views are between two hotels so very limited, and unless you are on the 7th floor or above (there's 9 floors) you're screwed. Either by the building in front, or the palm trees completely blocking everyone's view, or the 2 nicer hotels with fantastic views on each side. My girlfriend and I were so disappointed with the pictures that made this room appear to be grand, and spacious to find an updated dorm room with new sinks, a TV with basic cable and a PS3 to play movies. The rest of the room had just enough space for walking. I could keep going about the things that bothered me, but below is the detailed description of costs and other aspects. First, let's get this straight, there is so much nickle and diming going on here. Maybe they are trying to make up for profits other actually ""nice"" hotels are getting. It is $25 a night to store your vehicle or $4 an hour. You have to pay a ""concierge fee"" of $25 a night as well. I thought I already did this through expedia because those fees looked like the $25 a night, but no, they still have you pay for that fee if you booked through a 3rd party and not them directly.....Second, you get a ""continental breakfast"" each morning. Ya, if scones and fruit with coffee or a apple/carrot smoothie shot is breakfast...... I was offended this was even offered. It just furthered my irritation with the fact we forked over a grand to stay at this place.....Third, the place is cramped which was something I knew going into it with the lobby pictures (obviously the room pictures did not make it appear to be cramped), but it is literally cramped up and down throughout the entire hostel I mean ""hotel"". The hallways are cramped and hot which made us very hot and sweaty waiting for the 9 story elevator system..... We thought it smelt like salt and sweat. They say they have a bar which they do but it basically is an employee that helps out and when they have to stand behind the bar they just watch movies all day. A) because ppl realize they don't want to have drinks at a 4 seater bar and B) this hotel sucks and not appealing for a bar scene (nor big enough).Ok for positives. Like I said the staff was probably the best part. They really were great people trying to help. As for location, yes this is a good spot. If this was Vegas it would be towards the end of the strip however. Sure, it was nice to have Free DVD Movies (I was super surprised these were actually true to their word and ""Free""), but who wants to watch movies in a hotel in Hawaii lol.....? When we were winding down, this was nice though. The bed was nice, good amount of comfy pillows, linens were good, TV was big. That's about it though. Overall I was extremely disappointed with the quality, the size of our room and the overall hotel. Especially with the gimmicks and hidden fees.I would have rather just forked over the 300 a night to stay at an actual nice hotel......Good Luck!-B","Redondo Beach, California","Brandon P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redondo Beach, California</strong>",3,2.0

There is no pool on site but you have access to 2 other ones nearby at other hotels. We preferred the beach anyway, the hotel provides sand chairs and towels. Room was spacious, clean, comfortable and quiet. Because we did a lot of walking we were not concerned about not having a gym although that may be important to some. We prefer to not pay for a lot of things we are not going to use. The lobby area is nice and there is a space for a nice continental breakfast in the AM.

Every member of their team that we interacted with (front desk, bartender, maids, bellhops) were all friendly, outgoing, and sincerely interested in our stay and comfort. Renew is a smaller, boutique-style hotel with a modern decor (albeit a bit dated). It is located on the end of the Waikiki strip, near the Honolulu Zoo and Tiki's Bar & Grill. The current rates for Hotel Renew make it an excellent value.Upon check-in we had small issue with our room, but the staff at the front desk rectified it quickly, efficiently and with very minimal impact on our stay. Additionally, due to weather on the East Coast our flight home was cancelled twice, but they staff was quick and efficient in making us accommodations (granted we were lucky that they had 2 additional nights available). The included breakfast is basic: fresh fruit, muffins, pastries but the highlight is the fresh juice, but they run out quickly!Rarely are you able to stay at a place where the staff always seems available and eager to help, is able to make quick and efficient decisions that make you feel accommodated (and special), and impacts your stay in a positive light as much as the renew. There are newer, brighter, and much more expensive hotels in Waikiki, but I would put the Renew staff against any in Hawaii! Thanks to the staff for an excellent stay! Aloha!Rental Cars: The Hotel Banyon, which is about 2 blocks away (only 2 crosswalks - both at the same intersection) offers 24hr parking for a flat rate of $20 cash only.

It is a boutique hotel, so it looks tiny in comparison to the giant Hiltons/Hyatts/Marriotts around it, but don't be fooled! The interior is absolutely lovely, the quality of the rooms great, and the staff really some of the friendliest and most helpful I've ever met. I will admit I'm someone who rarely needs much from the staff aside from suggestions on food to try and places to visit, but they more than provided on that front, with maps and smiles. (On their tip, check out Side Street Inn and Uncle Bo's for some awesome local Hawaiian food, both of which are delicious and none too pricey).As you're close to the beach and other hotels, you may get a bit of street noise, but we didn't find anything too obnoxious. The bedrooms were modern with fun dimmer lights, beds were great, the bathroom clean. The hotel offers you two free (Keurig) coffees per stay for your room (though there's free water/coffee in the lobby), continental breakfast, and wifi all included in a $25 daily amenity fee, which I didn't find too outrageous, considering those fees seem to be the norm of Hawaii hotels these days. The view out the window of our room wasn't particularly impressive, but we spent very little time in the room staring out the window, so it wasn't a problem for us. ;) You also get proximity to the beach and an ABC (food/liquor/souvenir) store literally next door and are an easy walk down the main street for all the tourist shops and good food (and drinks!) -- though keep in mind some of the best restaurants are off the main drag, farther back in the more residential streets. I would say parking may be your only real concern -- Hotel Renew does offer valet, if you'd like to take them up on it, but we managed to find a parking garage just one block down that offered $15/day parking, or $60/7 days. Overall, an excellent stay for the two nights. Staff always smiled and said hello, welcome back, or wished you a good day. Really lovely people who I suspect have great suggestions for anything you want to do -- whether it be low-key local exploration, shopping, checking out downtown, or hiking and more nature-related adventures.

One side viewed a city hostel and the other window was a view of a parking garage. I looked once and never opened the shades again. Breakfast was good - Danish and the like, coffee was excellent. I liked having a free paper. Overall, if going back to Oahu, I wouldn't stay at this hotel again, not with all the other hotels in the area that have rooms with fabulous views of the ocean in the neighborhood. I'd spend the extra money to stay at a nicer hotel.","Southport, North Carolina","frankcJ1072GO</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southport, North Carolina</strong>",8,3.0

While booking the room we wanted we saw that we were being hit with an unadvertised hidden ""amenity fee"" increasing the price of the room by more than $25. Faced with this irksome 'surprise' we changed our booking to a cheaper room essentially sacrificing our nicer room for the ""amenities"" we were being charged for.One can easily imagine how we went from ""irked"" to insulted and pissed off when we were checking in and given very complicated directions to the pools and gym that started with, ""leave the hotel, cross the street, go around the corner and enter THE MARRIOTT hotel..."" That's right - the amenities for which we were being charged almost $27 PER DAY were not even in our hotel! They were in a competing hotel on the next block down the street!! We didn't even have any interest in amenities in the first place and if we wanted to use the Marriott amenities, WE WOULD HAVE STAYED AT THE MARRIOTT. Their website lists the amenities as including a cool towel and pineapple juice upon check-in, wifi, local phone service, newspaper IN THE LOBBY (?!), continental breakfast and coffee in the room. BIG DEAL! These are all included with the price of the room at most hotels. Most hotels in Honolulu who charge a fee like this call it a ""resort fee"" because they have resort amenities but this hotel has to call it an 'amenity fee' because it's decidedly NOT a resort. Since it isn't a resort but they want to be able to charge the fee that all the other hotels charge (which also allows them to list a lower room rate for online searchers by making it a separate fee) they cobble together a lot of lame (cool towel, juice and aroma) so-called ""amenities"", arrange with the Marriott for access to their pools and call the whole mess ""Club Renew"". Then their website misrepresents Club Renew by making it seem like it's all physically part of the hotel. Hotel Renew didn't even have the basic amenity of an on-site restaurant. It's really too bad that they have this shady underhanded way of doing business because the hotel itself, the staff and the room were all really great - even excellent. Of course even though our room was very nice I'm sure the room we wanted was even better. The irony is that had the hotel let us give them the money for the room we wanted instead of taking it surreptitiously for non-existent amenities, we would have been delighted with the hotel and this would have been a glowing 5-star review. Instead we were left feeling like we were chumps who had been duped and wouldn't stay there again or recommend it to anyone else.

You also get access to the swimming pool at the big hotel next door (Four seasons, I think?), which is nice if you want to snack while lazing around.The complimentary breakfast was pretty uninspiring though.

I requested over and over again for an early check in at 7am and i even suggested to pay half of the money of a full day for this. I never got an actual response back from the hotel (i booked it through booking.com) - i just got back the automated response (i guess) that my request is possible to happen but they will be sure if this was available a few days before our visit - ok reasonable. So, the day before our visit i realized that I have not yet received any response according to my early check in. So I emailed directly the hotel and what i got as a response was that my request was not available and that i would have to book the room for the day before. Also what really bothered me is that the agent that was responding the emails for the booking asked me to write my credit cards details in the email!!!! Is he/she serious??? I eventually ended up paying through the phone (don't know either if this is secure) even though i requested to book this booking through their webpage or through booking.com. So we were arriving at 7am in the morning of a particular day of the month and they forced me to pay for the day before just to make sure that i was going to be able to check in early...!!!! To understand what i mean... when we arrived the receptionist told us clearly that he will check us out from their system for the last minute booking we did for the first day that we did not even use, and that he will check us in from their system for the 1st booking we did. VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!! They had the room available and they just wouldn't make their customers a facilitation!!Also for the resort fee ... the amenities are not even in the hotel grounds!!! The amenities are located in the Marriott hotel across the street!! They force you to pay also for the amenities even if you do not want to use them!!! Breakfast was ok but not many tables were available.Rooms... Small... And our main complaint is for the lighting.... Take a flash light with you!!

The hotel is a fairly small boutique hotel, with modern decor, although it is a little worn in some places. The hotel is very centrally located in Waikiki, only half a minute to walk to the beach and to lots of shops and restaurants. The staff at the hotel were fantastic and really helpful with rental car bookings, and in suggesting places to visit on our drive around the island. Included in the rate was a basic continental breakfast each morning, and the breakfast area turns into a cocktail bar for a few hours in the evenings (nice for a pre-dinner drink, however as it only has a few tables it can get full there quite quickly). We booked an ocean-view room, which was of a reasonable size, and did have a nice view of the ocean. It was a little disappointing however that the hotel doesn't have balconies, which I really missed seeing as it's a nice warm beach destination (it's a shame to be inside with aircon on when enjoying the view!). The hotel doesn't have it's own facilities such as gym, swimming pool, etc, however Hotel Renew guests are allowed to use the facilities across the road at the Mariott. The only other thing we were a little disappointed with was the extra cost of the amenity fee that guests have to pay per day. Although we were aware of this at the time of booking, it does add up and make an already costly holiday even more expensive. I'm not sure if this is standard practise for all hotels there, or if this is unique to this hotel. Overall though this was a good, clean, moderate standard boutique hotel in a very good location, which I think would be best suited to couples or friends travelling together.","Oslo, Norway","KiwiinNorway</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oslo, Norway</strong>",24,4.0

This hotel is best described as ‘narrow’, situated right on a street corner. From the lobby to the hallways, this hotel definitely doesn’t have much available space! The hallways are dark and dingy and everything seems to have been done on the cheap. The only positive thing about this hotel is the location! Located a minute walk from the beach, shopping and restaurants.Pros: So little to mention, but I’ll try. 1) As mentioned before the location is excellent. Right in the centre of the action! 2) The room sizes was decent for such a small block of land. 3) The rooms were clean. 4)…that’s really about it… sorry, I honestly can’t think of anything else that is positive to say.Cons: Now here there are quite a few: 1) The hotel space is tiny! There lobby is the same size as your room. The hallways are narrow and dark. Lighting is extremely poor in all public areas of the hotel, giving it a very dingy, depressing feel. 2) The quality of fixtures in this hotel is horrid! Our drain was blocked and slow to clear and we had a tap that constantly fell off. Several of the power outlets in the room didn’t work. 3) The hotel proclaims a pool and gym, which you may assume is on their grounds. We were annoyed to discover, upon check-in, these amenities were being leased from the Marriot two minutes walk down the road! 4) Their ‘complimentary’ wifi (which you pay resort fee for) was unreliable and slow. Logging in was convoluted and irritating each time. 5) Their ‘complimentary’ breakfast (which you also pay a resort fee for) was utter inedible garbage! It consisted of oily muffins, sugary pastries and a bowl of fruit. There were only four 2-seater tables for the entire hotel in the breakfast area! 6) The rooms stunk! They cover this up with their ‘aroma concierge’ which is basically giving you air-freshener in the room upon check-in. 7) Lighting in the bathroom was described as ‘ambient’, which means you didn’t get a lot of light in there. 8) The beds were uncomfortable and lead to many sleepless nights. 9) The fridge wasn’t great at keeping things cool. 10) The elevators were slow and one seem to be malfunctioning.Conclusion: For the cost this is one of the worst hotels I’ve ever stayed in! It was trying way too hard to appear as a ‘boutique’ hotel on a hostel budget. Charing premium fees for such bad quality left me feeling ripped-off and disappointed.

When we informed the front desk they sent engineering whose solution was to a) destroy the sink plug and b) hammer the shower tap back on...which lasted all of 5 minutes until it fell again. Add to this and the bed and pillows were by no means comfortable. I'm not a terribly demanding or entitled patron, but when a hotel can't get two basic things I pay for I get irritated.The facilities are equally disappointing and deceptive, where the hotel website would have you concluding that the gym and pool are located onsite. Not so. While it doesn't explicitly state this on their website no where does it actually clearly state both facilities are located in another hotel down the street. Moreover, the ""free breakfast"" (which you pay a ""resort fee"" for), is utter garage, serving a few oily, disgusting pastries, measly fruit, and horrid coffee. But that doesn't really matter because good luck getting seating to eat with all of 8 chairs to chose from.It was especially telling how many complaints this hotel must get when front desk staff didn't even bother to ask us how our stay was upon checkout. The only good thing this hotel has going for it is its location. Save your money and go else where. I would never stay at this property or anything else the Aston company owns ever again.

If only we knew about all of this as we would NEVER have stayed at this hotel and we are only thankful that we spent one night here to try it. Unfortunately it was the last night of our stay and it really wasn't the way to end our otherwise wonderful holiday.The fact that this hotel misrepresents itself as a 4-5* boutique hotel, and charges accordingly, is misleading and deceptive. The paint is peeling, the walls had strange marks on them and it just felt like a shoddy renovation gone wrong.The only redeeming feature were the staff and service they provided, they were polite, attentive and very helpful, but I would have preferred average service and a spotless, welcoming hotel room. What we got, being dirty sheets that had sand and grit in them from previous guests, and the airconditioning that sounded like a jet plane, meant that I spent the last night awake and sitting on top of the bed, waiting for the early morning to come so I could check out. I felt so disgusted by the sheets that I didn't trust the bathroom was clean (though it looked cleaner than the bedroom) and couldn't even bring myself to shower there.I would never return to this hotel or its chain of hotels, and I would certainly not recommend this to friends or family.

Close to a ton of restaurant/shopping options, especially the ""ABC Stores"" that sell everything! Staff were very polite and helpful. Upon arrival we were given cold, refreshing towels and pineapple juice. The hotel also provided beach mats and beach towels, which was very nice. Breakfast was included in the price, but it was primarily just pastries, croissants, and other 'bready' items, plus some fresh fruits. Adding some breakfast cereal or non-bread options will make breakfast less monotonous. Breakfast/lounge area was pretty tight and could get crowded. However, we never ended up having to take our breakfast back to the room. Valet parking was $25 per night. One drawback - stopping and handing off the car to the valet can be tricky. Paoakalani Ave is a busy one-way street with trolley stops and cab waiting areas, a lot of times right in front of the Hotel Renew. And if you cannot stop, then you have to negotiate a whole bunch of one ways, make a rather long trip around the area to get back on to Paoakalani Ave. The hotel was recently renovated, which was a plus for us. All the fixtures, lighting, etc were very stylish and contemporary, not to mention 'green' friendly. One downside, probably due to the renovation, there was a bit of new paint/burnt smell in the room. Not a terribly big deal. Also. the smell was kinda offset by the reed diffuser/fragrance that they sent up to the room, which we could choose from one of four options when we checked in. The bathroom had some cool lighting. It was mostly well appointed, except for the faucet in the sink which we found inconvenient to work with due to its position. The bed was very comfy. TV remote was a bit finicky, but we were not there to stay indoors and watch TV!!

The entire hotel was modern and clean in a great location, 1/2 block from the sand and near the Waikiki Zoo. There were a few issues which I feel compelled to comment on. First, upon our arrival, we were hit with a $25/day parking fee. The hotel is valet only. But, honestly, this worked out great for us. Many of the other hotels had lines pulling into their structures, where we only had to pull to the curb and leave it to the valet. That was definitely money well spent. And I'm almost positive every hotel has the same fee to park per day. Next, which was a surprise to me was another $25/day fee for amenities. The amenties include one free drink per guest upon check in, daily continental breakfast (consisting of coffee, fresh juices, fruit, patries, and muffins). This turned out to be something to look forward to first thing each morning. Also,included among the amenities was the free WIFI which didn't work 99% of the time. The pool and jacuzzi were located across the street at the Marriot. Happy hour was every evening from 5-9:30 in the tiny bar area. I have to mention that the bartender Char made the best mai tai I've ever tasted, hands down. In fact, all the staff was very friendly and helped to make our experience great.

All-in-all, I was more impressed by the service, location, and amenities of Hotel Renew and would gladly return there on my next trip to Oahu.Located at the far end of Waikiki on a side-street, the hotel is a short two-minute walk from the beach and is nicely positioned away from the bustle of central Waikiki. Check-in was friendly and efficient, with a welcome pineapple juice and towel, and a genuine interest in making sure you're properly welcomed to the hotel. I was pleasantly surprised to receive an upgrade to an ocean view room and by booking through Passport Unlimited, waived resort fees. Compared to the other hotels in Waikiki, Hotel Renew is competitively priced and well worth considering.Our room on the sixth floor was close to the elevators, but well soundproofed (unlike the Modern). The room featured everything you needed for your stay, with a mini-fridge for drinks, modern iPhone alarm clock (complete with lightening cable friendly dock), complimentary internet, and a nice large TV. As part of the resort fee, you're given access to a DVD rental machine, a complimentary cocktail from the lobby bar, access to the pools and fitness center of the Marriott across the street, and most importantly beach chairs and towels.While the view is slightly impaired by the hotels between Hotel Renew and the pacific, it's well worth the upgrade to as there's nothing like waking up to the beautiful blue sea. Nearby the hotel are several convenience stores, eateries, and of course a Starbucks. For those who like to exercise, you're perfectly situated to run around Diamond Head, stopping for a quick hike to the top, and then a brief stop at the Saturday farmer's market … and of course, you're steps away from the Pacific.All-in-all, I was extremely pleased with our stay at the Hotel Renew and would go out of my way to stay there again on my next visit.

Eight of them were spent at the Hotel Renew. I have almost completely positive things to say regarding our stay here.Location:The hotel is located right behind the Aston on the main strip. You're literally 2 minutes from the beach. We didn't really mind not having a view of the beach but we really didn't care for the view of the homes behind us. I always felt like someone was looking into our window (and we had no trouble seeing into theirs!). The garbage collection at six in the morning was loud! For us, the location was great, because we were really excited to visit the Honolulu Zoo and Diamondhead. Both of these are at the end of the main Waikiki strip, and a little ways from the shopping. We didn't mind being down at that end because it was a little quieter into the evening as Waikiki is lively and loud at night! I only wore heels to walk one evening (a bad choice since we walked all the way down to Ala Moana and back) and after that, stuck to flats and sandals if we weren't going to take a cab back.Rooms:We had a room on the top floor at the back. It was nice. They're fairly new and updated, as you can see in most of the photos. The housekeeping team kept everything really clean. The rooms are small, but you don't spend all that much time in them. My only complaint about the room itself is that there is almost NO space in the bathroom on the counter. Trying to get ready for a nice dinner out and I had to struggle to find room for a blow dryer and a flat iron.Amenities:The hotel does offer a continental breakfast, which we took advantage of almost every day. It was mostly muffins, pastries and fruit, but it hits the spot when you're up and ready to go. We did rent a DVD one evening from the machine they have. No complaints, easy to use. Guests are given access to the pool and amenities at the Marriott across the street. We used the second floor pools frequently due to the proximity to the bar.All in all, I would recommend the hotel. Just be aware that there is still a hotel amenity tax on top on your price. We had booked through a third party agency and were lead to believe that it was included.","Prince George, Canada","Kattjm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Prince George, Canada</strong>",21,4.0

Being residents of Oahu, we tried to find a hotel with some kind of kama'aina deal but they were all ridiculously priced, then we stumbled onto Hotel Renew. Reservations were simple and easy.We asked if we could have a late check in since my fiancé & I were both a part of the bridal party and there were no ways of sneaking away from the wedding to check in. We had a little trouble finding where we could park to check in, so we called the front desk and were told that we could pull up right in front of the hotel & a valet attendant would be out and thats exactly what happened. We were greeted by the girl at the front desk. They give you a cold towel that smelled wonderful and a glass of pineapple juice, yum!! While checking in, Rena took notice that we were dressed up and we ended up talking about the wedding. She then told u about the dvd machine that we could rent, and even suggested a few movies that we could enjoy with our son since she mentioned having kids of her own. By the time we finished checking in, it felt as if I knew Rena for years from the way we were conversating. She answered all questions we had, and was very informative! Being one who deals with lots of customers for work, I feel as if she went above & beyond regarding customer service because although it was late in the evening, she reminded us thst its finally time to relax after a long day at the wedding. Our conversation felt more personal & enjoyable rather than it just being some boring business conversation.The room was beautiful and very modern. Nice bed, lovely pillow, and a big screen tv.

So hopeful with any questions and very clean.Only feedback would be the noise of the air con due to the windows having so much noise if you open them, otherwise all great. The bar is also quiet cold so did not really want to hang around too long due to the high air con being on.Breakfast is basic with fresh fruit and juice plus pastries if you like that thing and coffee. Fresh cold water always available and free DVDs to rent after a long day.It is on one side of Waikiki but we didn't mind walking. Closer to diamond head side.Great price if your out and about (as there is so much do there).","Melbourne, Australia","Cat3172</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",112,4.0

It is described as a 'boutique hotel' which can have many meanings. The room was clean, reasonably spacious and being on an upper floor (6th) had a partial sea view - not quite as good as on the featured photograph. The public facilities were limited. A continental breakfast was provided but the breakfast area was extremely limited and it was normally difficult to find a seat. The breakfast itself was quite nice. We had a late flight departure and were initally unable to extend our checkout to a sufficiently late time, so we were intending to hang out at the Marriott next door - there is nowhere suitable for this purpose in the Renew. Eventually we paid extra for a late checkout which was welcome. In retrospect we might have considered a more traditional hotel where we could have relaxed in the public rooms prior to our departure. The hotel was quite expensive for what it offered but, in fairness, accommodation costs in Waikiki are over the moon anyway.The big plus which raises this rating to 4 stars is the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff in the hotel, not always found in larger (or smaller) facilities. The hotel was exceptional in this regard. In future, should we have a late flight, we might be tempted to look for a larger, more traditional hotel with facilities in which to comfortably hang out prior to departure. Otherwise we would be more than happy to return to the Renew and enjoy the unsurpassed service.","Canberra, Australia","binliner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",47,4.0

While this is almost true it is not quite the full picture. First the pros - the staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is small and the room we had - balcony with partial beach view - was of a reasonable size. The room was spotlessly clean. The free welcome cocktail was very nice served by a charming barmaid. The major con was the scrum to get the free breakfast - it is served in the lobby with not enough tables so inevitably it was not a relaxed affair. Our balcony overlooked the back of the nearby Aston Waikiki and there were trucks making deliveries nearly all day - this was very noisy. While there was access to a gym and a spa at a nearby hotel the general lack of amenities within the hotel itself is a barrier to the 'boutique' status.

The staff were very helpful and very friendly. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were spacious. The issues that i have with the hotel were:the shower was terrible. The shower head was terrible on pressure and obviously has issues passing water, or has an overly restrictive, water restricter in it. After having a day at the beach and wanting to clean the salt off etc, a more high powered shower would have been welcomed.Zero to no sound proofing from the outside noise. We were on level 7 and overlooked next doors high rise hotel. Each morning they have a person who sings for their guests and it just comes through the windows and doors. The windows are not sealed, and are not double glazed. The bathroom window is also not a sealed window similarly to every window in the hotel room. IT was hard to get to sleep due to the noise and any early morning noise traveled through the room to wake you up.The air conditioner works brilliantly, however its more noisy than a freight train coming through a china store. Im not sure if ours was faulty with the noise, but it was impossible to sleep with it on, as would have been preferred as due to no sealing in the room via the windows, the rooms warmed up again quickly.I think that the valet service is crazy expensive too. $25/day to park on a street, which 1 block away has 24/7 parking is just trying to take people for their money. That plus a cleaning fee / service fee each day can make it another $50US ex tax more than the room rate. If i had known (either through it being made more aware, or if i had seen that this was the norm) i would not have chosen to stay here.That being said, the staff were excellent and are very friendly. The free beach towel service is great along with the water down stairs. I feel that the water in the room should have been free, $2 / bottle is excessive.The hotel wifi is very handy and we had no issues with this. We didnt rent DVD's as we hooked up our laptop to the TV and watched netflix, but thats a great idea for families that want movies, they were free to rent at the entrance of the elevator. We also didnt take the opportunity to goto the spa either which was apparently across the road (may have been wrong) so cant comment on that either.We did not eat / drink anything from the hotel so am unable to comment.","Sydney, Australia","Dave4Ally</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",6,3.0

Also convenient was the use of the pool and workout room in one of the adjacent hotels.

We had just completed a 17 hour travel day when we arrived to Hotel Renew around 10pm and were looking forward to a nights rest. First impressions were great, the front desk staff were welcoming, the lobby was very nice and you were offered a glass of juice & a cool towel as you awaited your room keys etc. So far so good! We took a quick elevator ride to the 3rd flood and the door opened to a very dimly lit hallway. We arrived at our room, opened the door to be greeted by the inviting smell of armpit. The windows do not open so you are stuck with the AC as your only way of getting air from the outside. There were greasy handprints all over the black headboard and wall above the bed, hairs stuck to the tile in the bathroom and the loosely fitting bottom sheet was just on enough to cover the stained mattress cover. Not exactly what I was looking for after being exhausted from traveling all day. So, I called the front desk to let them know that our room had been hastily cleaned and that we'd like to move if possible. They told me they'd have to call me back - I waited 20 minutes or so, no phone call back. So, I went down to the front desk and was told they didn't have any other rooms and that I'd have to stay in that one. No offer to have the room we were in cleaned. I reluctantly returned to our room put on a hoodie, sweatshirt and socks and climbed into a dirty bed because all I wanted was sleep! We woke up about every half hour thanks to the broken air conditioner that sounded as though it was going to fall out of the wall. Worst night sleep I've ever had, I would've been more comfortable sleeping on a towel on the beach! I wore flip flops in the shower and anytime I was walking around the room, the lights were so dim in the room who knows what other filth was on the floor. Day 2 the housekeeper didn't change the sheets, clean the handprints or get the hairs off of the tile in the bathroom and the room still reeked of BO - even after I made the front desk aware of it the night before!Thankfully we didn't come to Hawaii to stay in our room and spent as little time there as possible. Pros: it's a short distance to Waikiki Beach, restaurants & shops. The hotel is located on the East side of Waikiki beach close to the Honolulu zoo and is slightly less congested than the other parts of the beach.Cons: Poor housekeeping, $25 ""Resort Fee"" per night (which they don't advertise and this place doesn't have a pool or gym so I'm not sure how it qualifies as a resort), $25 a night parking, lots of street noise. There is no excuse for poorly cleaned rooms. I'd rather stay in a clean outdated room than a dirty 'boutique' room any day.Will not be staying here again and will be weary of any Aston property.

A great contrast to the hyped-up tourist experience of the Aston Hotel next door, for example.We found the lobby to calm and inviting. The hotel is decorated in dark wood and grey tones which lend an air of serenity. There is a beautiful over-flowing fountain in the lobby next to the breakfast area. You'll even find aromatherapy choices for your room. We especially liked the heavy 'shoji screen' window treatment which are much superior to drapes in blocking out the ambient lightThen you discover that things don't quite work as intended. The wireless temp control on the wall is non-functional and you have to extract the wooden cover of the A/C unit to get access to the controls. The in-room A/C unit rattles every time the compressor kicks in, otherwise, it sounds like a hamster on a treadmill. The desk chair is impossibly low which makes you feel like 2nd grader at your Dad's office. The lobby is perpetually out of umbrellas for guests. The door man's suggestion of 'buying a poncho at the ABC store"" was not particularly helpful. The lighting controls are excessively complicated. There are nine green LEDs beneath the desk which blink like the runway approach at Honolulu International airport. Finally, the handle fell off the faucet in our bathroom.I can recommend Hotel Renew only if you get a great price and if you are just staying a couple of days in Honolulu.

There were no balconies in most of the rooms but a large picture window overlooked Waikiki Beach, less than half a block away. This is a moderately priced hotel offering excellent value and is a real favourite amongst Australians.We were warmly greeted on arrival and offered an ice cold pineapple drink. This is basically a no frills hotel but very comfortable and staff were most willing to please.Complimentary daily newspapers were available in the foyer as was cold lemon water.Each morning a complimentary continental style breakfast was available in the foyer with a limited number of tables and chairs, with most guests taking their coffee, fresh cut fruit and Danish up to their rooms.Bathrooms were a good size with a selection of toiletries.Literally two minutes walk to the sands of Waikiki and many restaurants, this hotel was well positioned. Next door to its big brother, the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower.A big plus was a key card giving access to the poolside and gym facilities of the large Marriott Hotel opposite.A trolley stop is virtually right outside, taking one to the shopping haven of the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, a twenty minute trolley ride away.The hotel is situated at the end of the Waikiki strip, towards the Diamond Head end.There was very little to find wrong with this property except their lack of reading lamps by the bed. The rooms were not large but more than adequate for a short stay, or for those just wanting to enjoy the delights of the Waikiki area. The bar fridge was a welcome addition as was the pod coffee maker.All Hawaiian hotels seem to have added a new tax, called an Amenity Tax, around $15 per night. This usually includes free internet, which somehow does not seem free when you are paying an Amenity Tax.For those that have not been to Waikiki before, there are a plethora of convenience stores called ABC selling everything one could possibly want from beach wear to beverages, both alcoholic and soft and every kind of high quality snack food from sandwiches to fresh fruit. One of these stores is situated virtually next door and most people pop in every day.One room item that impressed me greatly was perhaps the biggest wide screen TV I have ever encountered in a hotel. The picture quality was exceptional and it brought back memories of sitting in the front row of the drive-in movies (for those readers old enough to remember same). 1 minute walk to Waikiki and great value.129 Paoakalani Avenue, Honolulu - Phone: 808 687 7700","Sydney, Australia","johnpond</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",86,4.0

Unlike a lot of other places that label itself as a boutique hotel and end up being a circus and long queues and crowds a the lobby and elevator, this place was really indeed a boutique. As such, it was quite relaxing even though we were there during the peak of holidays during New years and Christmas. The lobby was quite busy during the complimentary breakfast near the end of the service, but besides that you could easily ask a question or get help from the front desk without waiting. Additionally, the valet parking was awesome. It was SO fast cause the guy is always out there and it's just up the ramp for him to pick up. At other hotels, you'd be waiting for at least 10-15 minutes. Elevators were fast, internet was included and had no problems either.The rooms were very clean and modern and very quiet; no problems with hearing traffic or drunk people outside and slept well. The only bad thing is I don't think there is much of an option for a view. We had an ocean view the first night, and it was just not worth it. Don't even bother and save by getting the city view.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Peachtreec</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",81,5.0

We were greeted by a very friendly front desk staff who gave us a brief tour of the lobby (very small) and then we were directed to our room (309). This particular room had a partial view of the ocean, but when we first arrived it had a very weird smell to it, I can't even describe it! When we let the front desk know about this, they immediately sent up some essential oils which corrected the smell within minutes. The room overall was very modern with nice finishes. Breakfast was limitet with some pastries, tea, coffee and juice. Valet is $25 per day and no self park options are offered (as expected in Waikiki). My only complaint is the noise level from that particular room. Since we were on the 3rd floor, we could hear all the delivery trucks and the bikes and all the party people making their way back at night. We had to use earplugs the entire stay. We never addressed the issue since moving rooms while on vacation sucks, but I am confident that the staff definetely would have fixed the problem. The room ended up costing us about $260 per night (booked directly with the hotel website) and thats including the resort fee and parking. Trust me, this is cheap for Waikiki. Also a nice benefit was that we were able to use the pools at the Marriot across the street.Overall, my only advise would be to request a room on a higher floor (if possible). I absolutely loved this hotel and will most definetely stay there again.","Las Vegas, Nevada","AnnaMaria123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",47,5.0

We were greeted warmly by the front desk when we arrived and the staff took up our bags up while giving us pineapple juice and cool lemon towel. We asked for dinner ideas and they helped us find some great options. We were given a room on the 8th floor with a nice view to the ocean. Upon arrival we were given a plate of cheese and crackers instead of the bottle of champagne included in the package which was a little disappointing because I will looking forward to sharing that with my husband.The room had great finishes, furniture, and we loved the lighting control options programed in the room. We thought that while the room was a bit on the small side, we loved that it was a boutique hotel that had been refinished. The king bed was very comfortable. We loved the way you could completely cover the window in the room with built-in panels. We loved the view. The TV in the room was huge and the playstation was a nice touch. The most unfortunate thing about our stay was that the hotel sits squarely between two other hotels and for some reason the neighboring hotel serves breakfast with live music at the pool area just in front of the hotel. We started hearing music at 7am each morning. We also noticed that the cleaning staff started very early in the morning; we would have preferred the start after 9am or 10am; that said, they did a great job each day cleaning the room.We loved the free movie rentals, the downstairs bar (with great drinks and prices), the breakfast bar in the morning, the local newspapers, and we loved the beach chairs and towels. The hotel is steps away from the beautiful beach and lots of great restaurants. We didn't get a chance to use the pool provided at the neighboring hotel.This hotel is at the edge of Waikiki beach near diamond head park. We took the public bus to Pearl Harbor and the ride took about an hour and a half to get to our destination. All bus rides are $3 per person per day and you can use it to go to any area, however, it may take a long time to get there. We opted for a personal tour company when going to Hanauma Bay. (Bring exact cash for the bus tickets.)

Although I have stayed in many other places since, this hotel stands out as one of the best and most friendly. Every member of staff I met had a smile and pleasant greeting and they were only too happy to give advice or assistance when requested. The room I was in on the seventh floor was well appointed and spacious with a very comfortable bed and modern bathroom which was all spotlessly clean and immaculately made up each day. The window looked out towards the urban side of Waikiki which is not too picturesque but the hotel is very close to the beach and the parkland alongside the zoo, so a short walk quickly took me away from the bustle of the built up area. There was a little noise in the street below from time to time, but this rarely interrupted a good sleep. Pool and gym facilities were available at an adjoining hotel and were of good quality and I made use of them on an unusual day of almost constant rain.Breakfast was excellent with loads of fresh fruit and lovely fresh pastries which I could eat to my heart's content! But my favourite aspect of the hotel was sampling the excellent cocktails served up each evening during 'happy hour' by barman Kasi in the cosy bar on the ground floor. His friendly and approachable manner and helpful tips on things to do and great places to enjoy evening meals made my stay all the more special. It helped to make my time away from the hote,l as well as in it, very enjoyable.

Pool area is very nice (at Marriot accross the road). Breakfast is included but very basic - pastries, fruit, juice and coffee. A few negatives though - the rooms lack natural light, there is also a lot of street noise and one night I could hear my noisy neighbours through the wall. I stayed in two different room types - the first was a corner room with balcony and ocean views from the balcony. The room itself was rather small and the bed appeared to be king single sized, this suited me as I was travelling alone, but if you had a partner, it could be a bit of a squeeze to sleep two bodies. The second room I stayed in was further along the hall with no balcony or decent views, but it was very spacious and had a king sized bed. The $15 amenity fee to use pool, spa, fitness centre, beach towels and wi-fi really annoyed me (and the fee is compulsory). I had pre-paid this fee via bookings.com and the lovely staff were kind enough to waive the fee when I extended my stay.","Melbourne, Australia","scooter4000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",25,4.0

The décor is modern and could not fault the room we stayed in. There are heaps of places to eat and shop within a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel does not have a restaurant but supplies a basic breakfast in the morning. As this is not a large hotel, the owners have an agreement with the Marriot Hotel (directly across the road) to use there pool and gym for their guests.

The hallways get a little warm but the room itself was very easy to control temperature. The housekeeping staff kept our room spotlessly clean. Love the crisp fresh sheets every day and the attention to detail. Thank you housekeeping.I find the staff very accommodating and friendly.

Rozanne Perry was assisting with the breakfast and she was so sweet and kind to us, always friendly and personable. What a special employee! She even brought a recipe for us one morning because we told her my husband had a favorite Hawaiian dessert he liked.

Also, if you need to get to the airport from the hotel. It'll only cost 12 per person! Just book the trip with the FRONT desk! Great job Hotel Renew! The only negative thing I have to mention is that we were told when checking in that they may be implementing a ""resort fee"" of 10.00 a night. We choose this place because there was no resort fee.

The rooms smell. They offer a ""scents concierge"" to cover up the smells. If you're not sensitive with smells - it'll be fine - but really - should the rooms smell to begin with? The rooms are old and dingy - they did a good job covering it up with a facade of modern furniture, but it's only surface deep. The chair I had in my room was about 3 feet off the desk - making it nearly impossible to use. When I flipped it over to try to adjust it (eventually maintenance had to send up a screwdriver), the chair was pretty gross underneath. I wonder if they got all their furniture second hand. The battery in the TV remote was dead. The AC unit on the wall doesn't work (hint: just lift the cover and manually set it)The rooms are tiny and dark. On top of that, they charge a $25 ""amenities"" fee (funny - all their amenities are things I'd expect from you know... a hotel!) and $25 valet parking. Except the valet is never there to get you your car or to pick it up. So I usually just walk in and drop the key off at the front desk. I can't wait until the FTC comes down on these hotels with their hidden amenities fee - saying pool/jacuzzi/wifi/breakfast is a separate mandatory fee is deceptive - we *expect* that in the original price per night). The pool that you can use is across the street at the Marriott, which is the most pathetic excuse for a hotel pool I've ever seen. Internet wifi works fine except the hours of 8pm - 10pm, when everybody is on it, so it crawls (I was there for four nights, and noticed this)For $230/night ($180 + $25 + $25), I'd expect a lot, lot more. This place barely meets your expectation of what a hotel should offer. I remember checking in, and a couple was talking to the front desk about the absence of a public computer (apparently it's broken). This hotel literally offers you a room, a bed, and a shower. This is the second Aston property that has been underwhelming. Think I will basically avoid any Aston properties from here on out. The only upside to this location is that it's in a great location with many awesome restaurants within walking distance.","Los Angeles, California","RoyK327</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",25,1.0

We all booked to stay at the Hotel Renew based on the fantastic reviews we had seen on Trip Advisor. We were not at all disappointed in our stay and were all very impressed with this Hotel. Our rooms were not quite ready upon check-in but we were greeted with ice-chilled pineapple juice and a cold face-towel which was a nice welcome after a long flight. The hotel offered to hold our suitcases for us until our rooms were ready. We were more than happy to set out and about in Waikiki and start exploring. The hotel is located only half a block back from the beach and is within walking distance of many restaurants, bars and shopping. Once we were able to check into our rooms we were not at all disappointed. The rooms were of a generous size and were very clean. We had a King sized bed, a full-sized wardrobe with plenty of room to hang clothing, a coffee machine with complimentary coffee starter park, bar fridge, air-conditioning and complimentary wi-fi, as well as a large LCD TV. The bathroom was also very clean :)We were also given a Club Renew Card which allowed access to the Mariott (across the road), to use their gym and pool facilities, however we never needed to use this during our stay. Why would you when you have the glorious blue waves of Waikiki Beach less than a minutes walk away! We were also given access to rent free DVD movies and games from the lobby, however we also did not use this facility, as most of our nights and days were spent out sightseeing or enjoying the local cuisine at near-by restaurants. Perhaps if we had stayed longer we would have ustilised this facility. The staff were all so friendly and helpful. There was no request too small or too big that they were not happy to assist with. They were able to organise transfers to the local attractions and they always went out of their way to greet us and ensure we had everything we needed. Special mention to Angie, who went above and beyond to give us a welcome call to our room and who also assisted my friends (2 males) change to a room with 2 double beds. The continental breakfast was perfect for what it was. Continental Breakfast means light, cold foods. Fruits, muffins, danish, juice, tea and coffee and that's exactly what we got. Anyone misinterpreting what 'continental' means and turn up expecting a full buffet breakfast have no right to complain. The breakfast offered at Hotel Renew was always prepared so well and there was plenty available to choose from. A perfect start to a hot Hawaiian day! We had so much fun during our stay and we loved everyone at the hotel who made our stay so wonderful. We do not see any need to spend hundreds of dollars more to stay in one of the larger resorts, as Honolulu is so vibrant with lots to do and see, you want to be out and about amongst it and not holed up in your resort. Thats why we found Hotel Renew to be the Perfect place to stay in Honolulu.

However, the girl in the reception was nice and managed to prepare a room, maybe because she saw we mentioned on our reservation that this is a honeymoon and we are coming from a long flight.

Second, amenities, you get a bed, you get a bathroom, you get a giant balcony (depending on the floor and side, you could get a great view of the ocean, as we did, you get a personal mini fridge, a coffee maker (with a complementary coffee starter pack), a well sized closet, a safe large enough for a few laptops, a comfortable chase lounge chair, color lcd tv with both free games and free movies from the lobby machine (think redbox but free), and most of all, you get to feel better about yourself knowing that just steps away from your building, at some of the other hotels, people have paid, double/triple/and beyond for rooms that server the same exact purpose. And that purpose? Well, lets see, your in hawaii, do you really want to talk about the inside of a hotel room? I sure don't, I didn't go to hawaii to stay in a hotel room, i went to experience the beaches, the restaurants, the snorkeling, the hikes, the attractions, etc, and I rented a hotel room to sleep in at night while I rested for my next adventure. So yes, these rooms aren't as giant as the hilton or Marriot, this hotel doesn't have its own pool (but with our 15 dollar a day amenity charge all we had to do was walk over to the Marriot and we had full access of their pools/towels/gym/hot tubs), but by spending a lot less money, and still getting an very comfortable room with impeccable staff service, i was not only able to enjoy my vacation more by having more funds for other activities but I was also able to relax more knowing that I didn't get ripped off in one of the most expensive tourist destinations on the planet.

The process was fairly quick and we were sent off on our way with the promise that we would receive a call as soon as our room was ready. We received a call around 2 (an hour prior to normal check in). From that point forward, the stay went downhill quickly. The first room we were given smelled like it had been locked up for months! The room was so dark and dingy. It looked as if the room hadn't been dusted in quite some time. We called the front desk and were given a new room. The second room had a better view, but that was the only positive about the room. This room also smelled, was dark and dingy, and had not been dusted.

Not very comforting to watch these two toss sheets across the room and throw pillows to the floor- I can't imagine what the process is when there aren't guests there to watch them. There were stains throughout the room- on the walls, on the lampshades, on the window covers, on the door frames. Upon walking in the bathroom, we noticed mold on the sink and around the bathtub. The sink handle could not be touched without the entire faucet moving. The toilet made noise when the toilets in the above rooms were flushed. The A/C rattled the ENTIRE night. The next morning, we went to check out as we had found a new hotel for the remainder of our stay. As we spoke with the manager, we were not greeted by any surprise- based on her reaction, I'd gather this happens fairly often. We also were not offered any apology. When we requested a refund of our money (as we were instructed by our third party seller) she outright refused. We then had to request a letter notifying said third party seller that we had to check out early because of the hotel condition, which she seemed frustrated by. She then wasted over 20 minutes typing up the two line letter. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AT THIS HOTEL! Motel 6 is just as nice and is much cheaper!!","Saint Louis, Missouri","ash_ortiz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",14,1.0

All members of staff including check in, breakfast service and valet had impeccable manners and greeted us politely, happy to offer us any kind of assistance. Nothing was too much trouble. Hotel is located as the far east side of Waikiki, very close to the beach and a manageable walk to restaurants. Rooms were virtually sound proof with doors closed, we could go out on the balcony at night to take in the warm sea air and listen to the music coming from the Hula Grill next door. Breakfast was ample - juice, coffee, pastries, muffins, fresh fruit - it was enough to keep us going until lunch time. Was nice to be in a smaller hotel with less visitors and no children to be seen during our stay. Also stay was during my birthday and it was nice to come back from a day out to find a cheese platter and a well wishing note.

Well, I returned this October (2013) to find that the Hotel was now run by Aston, something that was noticeable, unfortunately, in a negative way. While the staff and the level of customer service were still as great as I remembered them to be, what irked me was the new daily $15.00 resort fee, which really served an ugly reminder that the hotel was now part of a big-business, money-making endeavour. Back in 2011, I felt like Renew was a shining gem, a wonderfully kept secret, and that I, as a client, was among the privileged guests staying at what was then the 2nd ranked hotel in Honolulu on Tripadvisor. Fast-forward to 2013, and it doesn't surprise me that Renew's ranking has gone down. Back in 2011, it was the little things that Renew did so well that impressed me so much. But today those little things are overshadowed by the $15.00 resort fee and by the ""by Aston"" addition to the Hotel Renew signature. The hotel somehow became less special, more like every other hotel on the block, and, as a matter of course, the property lost its magic. And I'm not sure I would stay a third time because of this.","Montreal, Canada","Linc9166</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",32,3.0

Our visit to Hotel Renew lived up to the reviews and we had a great time. Yes, the hotel is not ocean front and does not have a pool. The city view rooms look out onto a hostel where people sit on the balcony a lot so if a view is important then you should get a ocean view room. The view from our room was incredible. The room was very retro modern and beautiful. All the lighting, bedding, fixtures and furniture was updated and very modern. The room was on the small side, but we knew that going in. However, there is a large closet and bench for suitcases. The lobby is beautiful and relaxing. I never heard any noise from any other room and the hotel was full that weekend, so the rooms must be very sound proof. The location was perfect for us, it is on the quiet side of Wakikki, but close to everything. The hotel gives complimentary beach chairs and boggie boards which was a great perk. Also, we really enjoyed the breakfast of pastries, croissants, bagels, fruit and ham/cheese rollups. No, it's not a hot breakfast, but we knew that going in. My kids are still talking about the croissants at the hotel. But what set the hotel apart for us was the service we received. The bellhop was probably the most helpful person we have encountered in 20 years of traveling. He was so responsive, friendly and knowledgeable. Every staff member was very nice and went out of their way. Our air conditioner broke on the first night and the maintenance was in our room four minutes after we called. They actually replaced our entire until while we were at dinner. Note that they use an air freshener in the air condition units that gives off a strong smell and was bothering my asthma. When I mentioned this, they removed the scent and recleaned the room. If you have having breathing issues, ask them to take the air freshener out.

The beds are huge and the room has everything you need - shower/bath. Big screen LCD TV, fridge and free in-room wifi that was for the most part fast and reliable. Safe in the room was free to use and this was a welcome touch.The complimentary breakfast was a great way to start the day and although it doesn't vary wildly it means you can rely on it if you are a fussy eater like I am!Valet parking was available, which we didn't use as parking was free on Kalakaua Avenue, Monsarrat Avenue and Paki Avenue (towards the zoo/park) between 6pm and 10am. Its popular though so expect to have to drive around a bit looking for a space. Watch for the red kerbs though - those are lifeguard spots and had more strict restrictions applied.If you couldn't blag a space there there is a multi storey attached to the other Aston just the next block up from the beach on Paoakalani Avenue (same as hotel) $17 is still cheaper than the hotel if you are tight like me!Seen previous reviews suggesting cars, especially convertibles would get broken in to. We didn't have any issues in the 5 days we had the car - a 2013 Mustang from Dollar (also recommended)Only negatives that I would mention would be the air conditioning in the room (whilst cold, it makes enough noise to wake the dead - but you get used to it) and the street noise early in the morning. We were on the 5th floor and it was audible with window shut - higher up may get on better)Wouldn't let either of the above put you off, Hawaii is a lovely, relaxed place and the hotel is well placed to enjoy all of Waikiki and the rest of the island!

We stayed at Hotel Renew from Aug 01, 2013 until Aug 07, 2013 and it was fantastic. From the location down to the staff, we loved everything. We were presented with a bottle of champagne on our first night and were quite surprised. The hotel is small and very charming and our room was clean, modern, comfortable and adequately sized. The decor and ambience of the hotel were modern and very nice. Breakfast consisted of fresh fruit salad (pineapples, melon, grapes, strawberries, etc) and pastry (croissants, muffins, etc) and very tasty pineapple juice. This got us started on the right foot each day. The hotel's location was perfect. There is no need to hire a car. The hotel is within an extremely short walking distance from the beach (2 mins), shops, restaurants, zoo and transportation to the mall. The stop for the pink line/trolley to the mall is just outside of the hotel. The fare is $2 per person ($4 per person round trip) and it is approximately a 15 min ride to the mall. The staff was extremely friendly, courteous and accommodating. On the night of my birthday, there was a platter of crackers and cheese in our room for me along with a birthday card. On the next night, the night of our anniversay, there was a bottle of champagne, with ice and glasses along with another card awaiting use in our room. We really appreciated the personalized touch. Our room was cleaned on a daily basis and the room attendant was also very polite and friendly. We would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Honolulu and we will definitely be returning to Honolulu and also to this hotel.",Bermuda,"Aliboo_11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bermuda</strong>",11,5.0

Near the zoo and Diamond Head crater. The rooms were small, but clean and modern with very comfortable bedding (though only double beds -- small when you have 4 people in the room). I found the rooms a bit dark. I prefer brighter lighting. You could control all the lighting from a bedside console, which was nice. I've never seen that anywhere else. Nice TV. No self parking -- only valet parking. The traffic in the area is crazy -- lots of congestion and one way streets. If I return, I will take a cab to my hotel and walk to get around, taking a cab or a tour if I need to go further away. I didn't used my car in the two days I was there except to drive up to Diamond Head at the 6 am park opening to see the sun rise from the top.

Complimentary Buffet Breakfast;  Assorted pastries, cereal, oatmeal, numerous selection of local fruits, coffee, tea, milk, great fresh island juices, etc is held in the foyer area. If you need a heavier breakfast, remember you are just steps away from a large variety of full service restaurants all along the beach strand.

Room;Our room had very nice decor & was absolutely clean, with pleasant fresh linens. We enjoyed a partial view of the ocean with below views of a neighboring hotel. Our room was 2 floors above that hotel's pool area. At first I was a bit worried about its proximity to our room, but it was a mute point. We could also see & hear all the happenings along that stretch of Waikiki. All of Waikiki comes alive at night, but the hullabaloo from the hotel below & beach was never a problem during our 3 days.Beach Location;Another nice thing, you can lay out on the beach just steps away from our hotel and enjoy a white sandy beach under a few palm trees.That part of Waikiki, in front of our hotel, is one of the larger sand areas compared to other frontage spots. Unfortunately each time I return to Waikiki (and this is not the hotel’s fault) I’m so very sad to see the sandy beach of all Wakiki is disappearing into the sea, its getting smaller & smaller. In conclusion, I certainly can recommend Hotel Renew. Each time I travel, I always like to stay at a different hotel, but I would stay at Hotel Renew again because of its value, location & service.","Boulder, Colorado","gal-gallivanting</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boulder, Colorado</strong>",46,5.0

I travel for work and spend too much time in business hotels and so was looking for something different for vacation. Hotel Renew met that need. It is a boutique hotel, and was exactly as other reviewers had reported. The reception folks provided a courteous and professional service that impressed me. It was appropriate for the type of hotel and for anyone who wants/expects a smarter travel experience. Our room on the 7th floor was decorated in a modern European style with an excellent ocean view. The king size bed was a comfortable, medium-firm with sheets and a duvet. Internet access was a little different as each room has its own wireless router. The resulting connection speed was excellent. Unusually, there was no coffee maker in the room. This was not a big problem as the lady that runs breakfast makes great coffee. The location of the hotel is good, 1 block from the beach. There is another benefit. The buses for luaus and Pearl Harbor tours, which the front desk staff can help with bookings, leave from the hotel next door. The valet parking was convenient, run by guys that were efficient at getting the vehicle out in the morning and patient at the end of a day when the car was at its most disorganized. There is a nice little bar where you will meet Kasi, who makes an excellent happy hour, and also later on, Mai Tai. Kasi is one of those people you hope to meet in a vacation hotel.

Also, the term ""city view"" should be considered very loosely as our ""view"" consisted of looking directly into the hotel across the road which isn't a major issue but when something is advertised as city view it would be reasonable to expect a view of the city?!?!This was our first time in Hawaii so I don't have anything in the area to compare it to, but considering the Renew has no pool or other resort facilities (we which knew and considered before we booked) and was no cheaper than many of the other properties in the area we won't be in a rush to stay here again.","Canberra, Australia","TravelingRaider81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",41,3.0

Service is just amazing, everyone working there is just so happy. And I just love how they remember us - its like going home every time we come back to the hotel. They even notice we took Taxi back one day and was out the whole day - because we usually drive our rental car - and asked where we went. Since they were just changed to Aston's group, they were short-handed, with many of them working long shifts - its amazing how they can still keep that big smile on, no matter what time you see them or ask them for help. Not one day did they disappoint us throughout our 1.5 week trip. Just amazing people!!The price, the location, the service - altogether, the best you can find in Honolulu.","San Jose, California","Oli0612</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",84,5.0

The hotel is small and the rooms are ""cosy"" but very nicely appointed. The music from the Aston Wiakiki came into our room every morning when we opend the lania door. An added side bennifit but very nice all the same. The linens and robes were excellent quality. We felt safe and very happy staying at this hotel. Breakfast consisted of coffee, juices, pastries, cakes and lovely fresh tropical fruits. The newspaper was available in the lobby every morning. When we went to the beach the front desk folks supplied us with towels, mats or chairs and boogie boards! Although at one extreme end of the main strip, the Hotel Renew is nicely located next to everything you need including the beach which was less than 5 mins away in flip-flops! There is a Starbucks half a block away on the Aston Wiakiki building (backside). We used the ABC store next door many times for water, other drinks and snacks. You can easily access many shops and eateries on Kuhio or Kalakaua from this hotel in a reasonable time. The hotel has a lounge that gives you a free Mia Tia at happy hour on Wednesdays! but no restauruant, pool or work-out room on the premises, but the only thing we didn't like was the lack of in room coffee.... we had to go the the lobby in the morning for it.

The king room had plenty of space for a high-maintenance couple. The bed was great, the AC worked wonderfully and quitely, and the room had many storage areas (under the bed, luggage stand with drawers, drawers under sink etc.). The breakfast was good--my only recommendation would be to add a vat of yogurts on ice. Free wifi worked well and the tv had plenty of crisp channels--no blurry channels here, LOL! We were on the 4th floor facing the hostels but it was relatively quiet. They offered pretty great drink specials during happy hour, the bartender was faboulous. Actually, the entire staff was wonderful! We did not use their valet. We parked at the Waikiki Banyan (201 Ohua) for $80 a week with in and out privileges--it's less than a block away and worked well for us since we drove somewhere at least twice a day.

I'd read reviews on this site about the venue and I'm happy to report this location was wonderful. Ab. a 50 yd walk down the block to the beach (the hotel provides towels, boogie boards, beach chairs). It is away from the super noisy mid-section of Waikiki, so closer to the zoo. The local buses drive down the street every few minutes, but I did not hear them in our room (we stayed on the 9th floor). Also, took a tour one day to Pearl Harbor and our bus picked us up a few yards away, closer to the Aston Waikiki (next door). No restaurant or pool onsite, which makes it a bit quieter I believe (less little kids shrieking by). I loved the calm ambience of the lobby and small bar area. They provide a free continental breakfast each morning of fruit, coffee, teas and juice, plus assorted muffins and pastries (no bagels, or any protein so if you need more substantial fare, go to a restaurant). No coffee maker in the room, but they have one in the lobby which also makes cocoa and tea. There was a ""cooler"" as they call it in our room, but it really is a mini-fridge, just has the smallest of freezer sections. Bed super comfy, assorted types of pillows, one chair at the desk, no table to ""dine"" just the desk. Bathroom very clean and modern. A/C was in the room and we used it the first night. However it was too cold, the air blew on me also. We then slept with just the sheets at night without the a/c on and did fine with that. We turned on the a/c for a few minutes when we got back from dinner and then shut it off before going to bed. Worked for us. Hotel staff was very helpful with renting a car for the day (Enterprise, a walkable three blocks away plus a discount thru the hotel). I heard from the other guests that the Renew charged $25.00 a day to park their car, which is in line with other hotels in a serious tourist zone. One note: all of the employees at the hotel appeared to be under 35 yrs old (?) but were very professional. I wish one of them had told me about the beach area south of the ""pier"" out front. It was full of lava rocks and I cut my foot up. No signs posted on the beach to warn you, but afterward I noticed regulars going into the surf with fins or river raft shoes. When I mentioned this to the front desk person, she gave me plenty of band aids and told me where to go that had soft sand. The ABC store, Starbucks, fast food places all nearby, easy to stroll to center of everything. The Aston Waikiki in front of Hotel Renew has a nice bar, great food in the restaurant overlooking the beach for a lovely sunset view (bring money) I enjoyed the Hotel Renew as it was a nice place to recharge and regroup from the din of Waikiki.

After a long flight (11 hours to LA and then another 5 and a half to Hawaii) it was lovely to be greeted with a cold towel and a gorgeous pineapple drink upon check-in! We were given Room 909 which was one of the best rooms in the hotel! We were lucky enough to have a gorgeous room with a totally amazing view of the ocean which we never got bored of!!! As we were on our honeymoon we were given some wine which was lovely of the staff :)Room was a decent size but had the BIGGEST bed I have ever seen! As a newly married couple we barely found each other for most of our stay haha, totally lost in that bed but it was so comfortable!!! Great widescreen TV, lovely toilet facitilies including a helpful line over the shower to dry off your swimwear etc! The hotel didnt have a swimming pool, but then again it didnt need one! You were literally 2 minutes (if that) away from Waikiki Beach! Amazing beach and loved spending our days there! The hotel offer towels for you to use so just ask at Reception!The hotel was right on the main beach promenade too so you are not far away from restaurants, bars and shops. Honolulu Zoo is only around the corner too and a very cute zoo :) If you want to do any day trips the buses from various companies arrive outside the hotel so thats useful!!I could go on about this hotel and I wish we could have stayed there longer!!!

When we arrived a doorman took our bags to our room, and we were greeted with cool towels and pineapple juice. Our room was very modern and chic and plenty of room for two people. We had all the amenities we needed in our room and everything was refreshed and cleaned daily, providing us with extra soap/ towels/ etc regularly. The hotel was very clean and looked pretty new.What seems to be really rare in Waikiki is to find a hotel room that doesn't charge extra for Wifi, and Hotel Renew does not! It was great for all the times we needed to look up restaurants, maps, phone numbers, etc. Also, a lot of the hotels have a buffet style breakfast that you pay for, but again, Hotel Renew had a nice complimentary breakfast every morning with juice, milk, coffee, muffins, pastries, and fruit salad (which definitely saves money because food is expensive in Hawaii!). They also let you borrow beach towels, mats, chairs, and boogie boards for no extra charge! How convenient! :)One night, we got home from a luau to discover that we had forgotten our picture (that we had just bought) on the bus. We mentioned this on the way to our room, and the front desk called the transportation company several times to get the picture returned to us. Another day, we got home late from SCUBA diving and missed a shuttle, and they offered to call a cab to get us to our offsite location later that night. When we were preparing to leave, we realized we needed to print out a ticket for Speedi Shuttle, and the front simply received an email from us and printed it out! We asked them a ton of questions throughout our stay, and they were so friendly and helpful, I cannot say enough about the pleasant and helpful staff!!! I happen to remember the names Adam and Anne, but everyone was delightful, from the doormen, to the front desk, to the woman serving breakfast, to the maintenance men, to the cleaning staff! Very convenient location, on the East edge of Waikiki, so not as loud as some of the other areas (although it is all loud), close to bus and shuttle stops, and close to restaurants and ABC stores.

To close out our holiday after visiting other islands we were looking for a cheaper option than the Outrigger Waikiki we stayed at 2 weeks prior (great hotel). We chose this hotel based on location and most importantly price.The hotel is a smaller hotel, no pool, no big bars or restaurants, no tourist desks, shops etc. Rather it's just a small reception, small bar that doubles as a breakfast room and perhaps 8-10 levels of rooms. It's about 125m (450ft) from the beach in a decent part of the strip. It is however a good walk to the key shopping areas and the glitzier part of town.The Good: Clean rooms of a fair size. Decent bathrooms, modern décor - all feels new and fresh. Staff are great. Close to beach. Free wifi. A lot to like.The Bad: Noisy. Very noisy. We stayed on the 4th floor and were woken a number of times by people talking in the hallways, people talking on the street and in surrounding car parks. Truck beepers and bins being emptied in the early morning was another treat. The worst of all was the air-conditioning. It's all or nothing with it roaring like a 747 engine all night. You can't adjust the fan speed either. Combine this with it blowing on the unlucky person to be sleeping on that side of the bed. We ended up just turning it off and dealing with a sticky night. I hate whining about things that seem trivial, but this really did impact sleep quality and the overall experience. So much so that I would say don't stay here unless you are on a high floor and are a really deep sleeper.It's a quality hotel with great staff and clean rooms.. but the noise ruined it.","Perth, Australia","DaveInWestOz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",59,3.0

Rent a car, it's a must but the parking will cost you a lot of money. There is a garage for $15.00 and another for $7.00 but that one is always full. The valet in the hotels are $25.00 a day. Free parking by the zoo but you do have to walk a little. Make sure to have sandals or sneakers because you will be doing a lot of walking. Bring comfortable clothing, like shorts and tanks. Everyone is dressed down. The happy hour drinks are all watered down at all the restaurants. It's best to spend a few more dollars to get a great drink. Most people shared their food and that's what bwe did to save money. Don't do any Luau's, not worth the money. They do Luau's on the beach for way cheaper and it's the same thing.

The location was good- only a short walk to the beach- but it is on the quiet end near the zoo and diamond head. They supplied towels, beach chairs and bogey board. We had a rental car and paid the $25 valet parking( only option at hotel) . Retrieving the car was very easy and fast. What this hotel has going for it is their excellent customer service. The staff is super friendly and helpful. They always greeted us as we walked thru the lobby- and went out of their way to inquire if we needed anything. The only real negative I can note is that I could hear loud conversations in the middle of the night- I believe coming from the street. My kids had an ocean view room and said they did not hear anything. Of course they are teenagers and can sleep through much more than I can, especially when adjusting to the time change.

We asked them many questions / requests for bookings and they were only too happy to help, and extremely friendly2) Free wifi - not many hotels offer this, and so it was such a benefit for us to be able to look up tours / hotels and book our transportation.3) Great location - The beach is almost just across the road; its got all the benefits of being close to the beach without the price tag. All the tours / outlet buses etc depart from right outside the hotel (as it is next to the Aston Waikiki), so it makes it perfect for heading out to see something. Its also a very short walk to the main strip of shops / restaurants. There's an ABC store on every corner but one right next door is actually really helpful.4) Free beach gear - towels, chairs and beach mats5) clean!We stayed in a city view double room with 2 x double beds and it was perfect for what we used the hotel for; sleeping and resting in between shopping. the view wasn't great but i wouldn't want to stay cooped up in the room looking at the view anyway - we were out enjoying it.A couple of tips:1) ask the hotel to organise your trip to the premium outlets. They'll arrange for you to go with a company that only charges $10 return trip (with departure around 10am, and return times of 2, 3, 4, and 5pm). This is much cheaper than the $25 trolley that you can take as an alternative that are advertised at those booths.2) Go and eat at the Cheesecake factory. It's AMAZING. I would recommend if you're going, plan to arrive there 1 hour before you want to actually eat, as there WILL be a queue. Get the buzzer and then go and do some shopping during your wait. 3) Macy's has a 10% off international visitors card. You just need to ask them. 4) Go to hanuama bay. Its stunning. we ran out of time to experience it in full but wish we had.","Melbourne, Australia","IntrepidTraveller84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",20,5.0

No pool in the hotel but why would you need one with the beach on your doorstep.The staff were always very pleasant and courteous and always helpful. This gave the hotel a warm friendly atmosphere. Room was spacious, comfortable and cleaned daily. Noisy in the early mornings with the traffic, bin lorries and early risers. We were on the 5th floor at the rear of the hotel so that may have been the reason we heard it as there was a mopeds hire shop just beneath our window. But we were in Hawaii so the early start was not a problem. Wifi was free. Breakfast was a selection of pastries, tea/coffee and pineapple juice. Going to the beach we were provided with towels, bodyboards and there were chairs if you needed them all free of charge. Hawaii is a paradise and we really enjoyed our 8 night stay and our base at the Renew. The Aston had a nice restaurant and bar right next door and we only found LuLus (on the opposite side of the Aston) on our last night where we also had a lovely meal.

My reasons remain the same: style, service, and location.STYLEThe Hotel Renew was formerly a part of the adjacent Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel. It was totally remodeled in 2007 under the auspices of Malaysian-raised, San Francisco-based designer Jiun Ho, creating a Zen-like designer boutique hotel light years away from tiki torch Hawaiian kitsch, incorporating organic elements such as water, earth and fire into a total design concept that could easily hold its own in any urban city.During my first stay, I noticed the attention to detail and the cohesive bespoke nature of the hotel's furnishings and features, from the lobby and lounge area to the elevators, hallways and guestrooms. In my room, I noticed repeating patterns and colours in the headboard, shoji screen window coverings, towels, pillowcases, wool throw, robes, ice bucket, wastebasket, laundry basket and tissue holder. Some things apparently did not withstand the test of time and wear, since for this stay the towels, pillowcases, robes and ice bucket were of a more generic nature.I had specifically booked a City View One Double room because I knew this room type (the 01 rooms) has a balcony from which one can catch a view of the ocean, although it mostly faces the Marriott hotel across Paoakalani Ave. These rooms are the smallest in the hotel but do not lack any features, they just have a smaller bed. Room features include a desk with a unique lamp, another light fixture that is like a backlit piece of wall-mounted sculpture, and a mini-fridge. All bathrooms have a raised sink with limited counter space, but there are shelves next to the sink. My shower/tub had one of those curved curtain rods that allow you more shoulder room, plus one of those shower curtains with a clear top panel to allow in more light. My previous room's shower had sliding glass doors.Note that each floor (2-9) has 9 rooms each for a total of 72 rooms, no suites. Only 4 rooms on each of the top 4 to 5 floors have ocean views, since the Aston's pool area and garage block lower floor sea views. The sea view is limited on 2 sided by the taller Aston and Marriott hotels. I suppose some City View rooms have views of the mountains in the distance, but you mostly see other taller buildings. Directly across Lemon Ave. (really just an alley) are 2 rather gritty hostels and and ABC store. Paoakalani Ave. is a noisy street used by many tour buses, trolleys and shuttles, but the white noise from the room's A/C helped greatly in blocking out the traffic.SERVICEIn such a small hotel with limited amenities, personal and friendly service is achievable, expected and welcome, and it remains a strength for the Renew. As usual, I was welcomed with a glass of pineapple juice and a cold towel (with the wavy pattern all the towels used to have). By the way, I think it's nice to have an enclosed air conditioned lobby rather that the typical open-air lobbies in most other Waikiki hotels. The room was not ready, but was contacted by cell phone when it was. Staff are very helpful with directions and recommendations. Lots of beach equipment is available for use as well. The continental breakfast service has changed a bit since my last visit, although the staff was friendlier than last time, when people were chastised for trying to get breakfast before the official 7am opening. I recently took a look at photos from my last stay, when breakfast included: yogurt, sliced fresh fruit, cereals, croissants, danish and muffins (served from a tray on the bookshelves) , coffee, tea, juice, and a variety of milks. There was also a side table with a toaster and a selection of breads. For this stay, there was an increased variety of croissants, danish, muffins, scones and bagelettes (some with savory toppings like egg or cheese), and there was coffee, tea, juice, soy milk, half & half. No more yogurt, fruit, cereal or toast. The toaster table now holds one of those fancy machines that dispenses espresso, cafe au lait, tea, hot chocolate, etc. And another table has an urn of infused ice water at all times. Additional tables were set up during breakfast, since there are only 4 permanent tables.Regarding parking, valet parking is $25 per night. The valet stand is not always manned; you have to go inside to get help sometimes. I was fabulously fortunate to find street parking every night of my stay, directly across the street on Paoakalani for 2 nights, both times near the gentleman whose home is on the sidewalk outside the Marriott--he can be seen in photos from 4/13 posted by another TA reviewer. Street parking in the immediate vicinity is metered until 6 or 7 pm, but parking is free, if you can find it, on streets north of Kuhio and on Ala Wai Blvd. Be careful about street sweeping times on Ala Wai; I saw many cars being towed on one fateful day. Overnight parking can be had for $15 at the Waikiki Banyan garage on the corner of Paoakalani and Kuhio--this has been mentioned numerous times in TA forums.LOCATIONThe hotel is located on the eastern fringe of Waikiki. Parking is easier to find here.This area is slightly less congested with tourists, and there are more locals on the beach here (as well as homeless), which is wider than in central Waikiki. Plus, there are no hotels on the beach side of the main street (Kalakaua) here. Kuhio Beach is very calm because there are sea walls breaking the incoming waves, great for keiki. Adjacent Queen's Beach, without a sea wall, is favoured by locals for body/short board surfing. The 2 are separated by a wall called the Kapahulu Groin, from which it is exciting to watch youth hurl themselves with reckless abandon into the turbulent sea. And the sea was turbulent during this visit, as unusually large swells along south-facing beaches such as Waikiki brought out pretty big crowds.There are innumerable dining options all along Kalakaua and Kuhio. Our favourites for this trip were Eggs 'n Things Eggspress at the Waikiki Circle Hotel (the place is tiny and wildly popular, especially with Japanese tourists--get it to go) and Rainbow Drive-In off of Kapahulu.We also were greatly impressed by Alan Wong's (need a car or taxi) and Alan Wong's Pineapple Room in Macy's at the Ala Moana Mall.The Renew remains my hotel of choice in this part of Waikiki, despite a little wear and tear. For a splurge stay, I would choose the Halekulani, but the Renew is a great, more budget-friendly option.",Los Angeles CA,"pillowsofwanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles CA</strong>",1202,4.0

Of course, the location is outstanding, close to the beach, off the main strip, closer to Diamondhead and nice parks, at the quieter end of Waikiki. Waikiki is not tranquil, however, so anyone sensitive to urban noise should maybe not stay in Waikiki. The energetic and positive staff clearly work hard to make this a comfortable hotel. The housekeeping staff did a great job of cleaning my room promptly every morning so I didn't have to return to a messy room in the afternoon. Do know in advance that the ""breakfast"" is a continental breakfast with a small assortment of croissants and sweet rolls, along with juice, tea or coffee. It is a smaller, more personal hotel than most in Waikiki. I requested an upper floor room by email in advance of my trip and was given one on the 9th floor, which was great. If you don't need a full-on luxury hotel at steep prices but don't want a hostel either, this hotel is a good mid-range option.","Seattle, Washington","chnalvr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",14,4.0

The Hotel Renew is NOT that. This hotel is different - its a small-mid-size hotel that feels cool and modern but still an inviting place to come back to after a day of doing what you do. In one of the world's more touristy locations, that's really refreshing.The hotel's layout and design don't follow the standard cookie cutter formulaic approach that the American chains take. The rooms, the lobby, the lounge/bfast room all have a modern and unique feel and the staff are friendly and helpful and pleasantly devoid of the parroty platitudes you get from the lodging factories. My room was kept in great shape by Tina and the valets did a great job handling my parking needs.There is a decent little continental breakfast in the lounge included in the price to get the day started. In the evening, it becomes a cool little bar that's decently stocked and with great value cocktails. Behind the bar was Kasi, one of the best tenders around - great drinks, attentive, friendly, and cool conversation. Kasi is one of the touches that makes Renew unique and a cool place to stay.To be clear, this is not a beach resort so if you're looking to have all of your entertainment, food, shopping, etc provided by the same people that provide your room, this may not be your place. But you dont need that on Oaho. Stay at Renew and with the extra few hundred per night saved over a resort, take a helicopter tour, rent a car and drive up to the north shore, watch or do some surfing, get some hot'n'spicy shrimp from Giovanni's truck and a shave ice from Matsumotos or Aokis, climb Diamond head, hike some incredible trails...then come back and hit Waikiki beach and Renew will provide you with some of the basic beach goodies like chairs, matts, and such and they are located a really short walk to the beach.The beds are comfortable, the pillows perfect, toiletries nice, lighting cool, TV good. And the wifi is complimentary and fast. The only shortcoming worth mentioning (maybe) is the view from the city side rooms which is less than appealing. This is nowhere near a deal breaker for me but I know some people who weight a view very heavily - you'd probably want to pay the extra for a room on the beach side if that sounds like you. All that said, what it boils down to is that I will stay at Renew again the next time I'm on Oahu.",,msb64,13,5.0

We booked a city view double room so we weren't expecting much as the room was concerned. We also knew that this was a boutique hotel and did not have all the stuff a resort hotel would have. First stop was picking up our rental car at enterprise which was fast and off to our hotel we go, which was about 25 minutes from the airport. We pulled up out front and I ran in and checked in. It was before normal check in time and was still able to check in which was nice. Was also given drinks and cool towels. Now, I hate the reviews about the valet cost of 25 dollars. That is standard price in Waikiki!! Know this before u go. So, after a quick drive around a few blocks, i see plenty of street parking up the block by the zoo. I'd say about 4 blocks from the hotel. We parked there all week long and saved Around 200 dollars just on valet parking. I didn't mind walking a few blocks, some days it was only 2 block walk. I suggest if u stay here park by the zoo and save!! There were no issues with break ins or parking tickets. Ok, onto the room. We walk into the room and to my surprise they gave us a balcony room with partial ocean view!! So the trip started off great! Room was very modern looking, unlike other hotels I've stayed at in Hawaii. No bright colors... Was darker with dim lighting and very modern looking. This is what i was looking for. Room was spotless and clean. Bed was very comfortable and bathroom spotless. Water pressure in bathroom was not so great but not major deal. Water was always Hott. Room was cleaned everyday. Oh and free wi fi for each room. This was nice as other hotels charge hotel fee everyday. This hotel does not. Ac in room worked ice cold and was quiet! Also was cold fridge in room which was nice.Breakfast was served every morning, it was muffins and pastries with coffee and orange juice. Was good to put something in stomach before we ran out in morning. I don't know why people complain cause they didn't have to put anything out and it's Free!!Bar was small but atleast they had one. Happy hour was from 530-730 with reall decent prices drinks. Martinis for 6 dollars during happy hour can't beat that. Chairs and towels were given at request without questions asked from front desk. So when you leave for beach grab chairs towels boogie boards or what ever u need and no extra cost or signing for them. Front desk was very very nice and helpful, can't say one thing bad. Sounds great right? Now here are the cons. The ONLY reason this hotel did not get 5 stars all around was because of the location. Yes it is within one block of beach which is ideal. Yet it still in bad location? This is due to 1) The Homeless at this end of Waikiki beach and 2) The noise of the block the hotel is on....I must say I've never seen so many homeless in my life. They are sleeping within view from balcony ( check the photos tab) I posted pictures. Not something u want to see when u step out on the balcony in paradise. Clean up the street I don't understand it. I would think the street is hotel property and they are set up all over. As you walk up Waikiki beach towards the Hilton hawaiin village the homeless decrease on the street. Down toward the zoo they increase drastically. Though only a few bothered us by asking for money. You still do not want to see!! I mean literally every ten feet someone sleeping on floor. Ok now onto the noise, this hotel is on a busy busy street. Tour pickups out front, traffic, loading bay directly across street with constant all day deliveries. I also posted pictures from view of balcony of the traffic. The noise ended around 10-11 pm ish and was ok overnight sleeping. I always slept fine. Some beeping of trucks backing up around 6am but we always up early so not major ordeal. But during day was unbearable. Balcony was unusable. The refrigerators of trucks running overpowered any conversation on balcony. Could not even hear anything but refrigerators at some times. When u shut all the doors in room it silenced it pretty much. We went out all day so wasn't major issue unless u stayed at hotel all day. Check out was easy and at 12 noon. Our flight was late so they have a room to shower and change after beach before u head to airport which was fantastic. Other than that it was a wonderful stay. Id deff atay at this hotel again if it was in a different spot on waikiki. This is really only because of the homeless located in that area. Not something u want to see everywhere in ""paradise"". Notes:Abc store right next door. Pricey but convenient.Hawaiin style scooter rental up block.Teddy bigger burgers up block ""best burger in town and cheap""!!!Zoo up block.Diamond head less then mile a way.Less then block to Waikiki beachRight in the tourist section of waikiki, everything in walking distance.Street parking in area ",,Jason A,22,5.0

The choice of places to stay on island with pets seems to have dwindled down to just this hotel. I went in with visions of a great boutique hotel and a wonderful experience for all of us. The booking was fairly easy on the phone. When I was told of the room rate, I asked about military rates and they said they were cheaper by about $50. However upon arrival, we learned that our room rate without taxes and fees was $212. On top of taxes, we had to pay valet parking and pet fees. In total over $300 - this is for ONE night.The experience started well. Cold pineapple juice and cool rags were placed in front of us upon check in. The staff was luke warm at best though. Just seemed to be going through the motions, not a hint of pleasantries. Off to the room we go... I was so impressed that they had two dog beds, water bowls and treats for our little fur babies. The room was nicely decorated too. But then the smell hit us! Wow, it was bad and strong. Maybe a cross between BO and urine? We even went to the closest ABC store for air freshener which never even touched whatever odor that was in there...The best part is that we paid $25 for valet parking only to find my car parked in a small alley way by the street. It was right out in the open, had I known that, I would have just street parked for free!We had a horrible night's sleep. I am just amazed that someone has not figured out a better place for their pet friendly rooms! They put us on the second floor right by the elevator. So not only are we getting the horrific street noise but all the traffic noise from our floor. We were up all night trying to convince our dogs that all the noise was okay so they would not bark. For future guests, maybe consider a higher floor AWAY for the elevators. Just makes sense!The walls are paper thin too! We heard the neighboring room's AC turning off and on, chatter and even heard a woman giving out her personal credit card information over the phone. We heard every single number. She may as well have been in the same room! Bring ear plugs if you have any hopes of sleeping...With the amount of money we paid for the room, we expected a decent continental breakfast. Nope, 3 pastry types, coffee, the same pineapple juice as upon checkin. That's it. We found something to eat out.Pros:Pineapple juice and cool towels upon check inBeautiful lobby and entry wayGreat location, a block from the beachCons:Luke warm reception and never any greetings as we came and went from the hotelSmelly roomOld style dirty feel hallways, looks unkeptPaper thin walls$25 valet parking that really was almost street parkingNoisy roomCrappy excuse for breakfastBottom line: While at first the hotel seemed nice and I appreciate them accepting pets - this was the worst hotel stay I have had anywhere. I guess I went in with high expectations given the online reviews and the price. I would say if you have a choice, unlike we did, you are better off staying somewhere else. We will not be back and I would never recommend it to anyone. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because I was able to muster a few pros.","Oahu, Hawaii","HawaiiAgain2010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oahu, Hawaii</strong>",5,2.0

I traveled here with my wife in July 2011 for a conference I was attending at another location. The hotel has 9 floors, but only 150 or so guest rooms so it is quite small by Waikiki standards. The rooms are modern with amenities from the last few years. Some of the rooms have glimpses of the water while others are of the city (we stayed in both). As well, I prefer the location of this hotel as it is at the eastern end of Waikiki (quieter) and away from some of the bustle. This is not to say that it is out of the way as it is still a half an hour walk to the farthest end of Waikiki. It is only a 3-4 min. walk to beach (half a block) and next to some of the better evening upstairs pubs (Tikis at the Aston next door). We did not have a car so I cannot comment on parking, but transportation was easy without a car. (we rented a convertible for one day so i could show my wife the rest of the island - pick up and drop off at the hotel a block away). For 150$ a night this was about 50-75$ less than the other 4 stars in Waikiki and well worth it. The lobby lounge is also a cool spot to pull up for a drink after a hard day in paradise!

Our travel agent put us in the Renew because she said it would be a perfect spot to rejuvenate after the long flights and two weeks of walking about in Australia. When we walked into the lobby, I immediately felt welcome and relaxed. The staff was amazing. They present you with a galss of fresh pineapple juice and a cool, moist lemon scented towel for your face. Check-in was seamless as was the checkout. The owner of Renew, Dan was a class act and I had the pleasure of chatting with him at their Wednesday afternoon guest mixer happy hour in the cute hotel bar. The beautiful and outgoing bartender Jackie made me feel welcome as well and she made me some great drinks. You must try her pineapple mojito! Dan and Jackie also gave me a great tip on a restaurant for that evening. The rooms were not too small as some have written. They were big enough for us. The decor of the hotel is very fen shui and just makes you feel relaxed. I loved the free use of beach towels and beach chairs too. All the trolleys, buses and most tour groups have a stop less than 200 feet from the hotel. Noise was not an issue for us. The beach is only 50 steps or so from the front door. I do plan to go back and spened a week there next March for my birthday.","Lusby, Maryland","zaneyone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lusby, Maryland</strong>",27,5.0

We arrived early so they tagged our luggage and put it in storage untill our room was ready. The next day when I inquired about transportation to Pearl Harbor they called for a shuttle to pick us up. It was only $32.00 round trip for the 2 of us. They offered a complimentary continental breadfast of rolls, coffee, tea, & juice. They allowed me to print my boarding passes off their computer and stored our bags again when we checked out, as our flight didn't leave until late that night. The best part of their service was the use of a room set aside for use to clean up before we had to leave for the airport. This was really nice as we spent our day touring up and down the Waikiki beach area and were in need of a wash and clean clothes before we traveled home.

Very friendly and helpful staff, very nice reasonable complimentary continental breakfast. One big pro for me was a mini-fridge for our use - no mini bar. It's not recommended for perishables, because its not really cold, but they note that fact too. That came in handy for buying water, soda and beer - which is available in the 3 'ABC' convenience stores within a block of the hotel. It's in a decent location depending on where you want to be. It's within a 10 min bus ride to Diamond head or a 45 min bus ride to Pearl Harbor. Any of these buses can be reached 1/2 block away. Tour buses and courtesy vans pick-up and drop-off yards away from the hotel entrance. It's 1/2 block away from the Waikiki beach, but personally speaking not the best part of the beach. It is a nice spot to see a great sunset. The room had free wi-fi and cat5 outlets, but I had to have the front desk confirm that because the internet provider listed they could demand fees aside from the hotel in their login terms, but the staff assured me it was totally free. Free toll-free and local phone service, which was nice to confirm dinner/tour reservations. The room had plenty of outlets, which was handy for us. There was a nice size room safe, wide enough for a laptop. Clean room and comfortable bed. There was light dust on top of picture frames and bathroom upper shelves, but that personally doesn't bother me, because unless you're looking for it you would say it's a very clean room (I guess I watch too much Travel Channel's Hotel Impossible). Now... while I would stay here in a flash because of the above mentioned great things and the value, there were things I personally wasn't wild about. The room was kinda dark. So much indirect lighting with dark furniture and dark stained wall accessories. The only chair in the room to watch TV was not comfortable at all. The bathroom had what I guess is called jalousies window, which is a glass shutter type of window. It let in A LOT of alley noise. We had to close the bathroom door to dampen the noise. The room's A/C I think was linked to our physical presence in the room. The room seemed warm when we get in, but seemed to cool down shortly thereafter. I was also surprised there wasn't a bottle opener since you could store drinks in the room...maybe it was somewhere, but I couldn't find one. All in all we liked this hotel very much and would stay there again. When planning your trip budget, be sure to note that there's a 4.712% sales tax and 9.25% accommodation tax too.","East Syracuse, NY","eddied2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>East Syracuse, NY</strong>",12,4.0

The rooms were modern and clean. The continental breakfast was typical, but clean. Frankly, I could go on.... The only drawback would be, though we were near the top of the hotel, you could hear the street noise until around midnight or so when things quieted down. With the exception of window replacement, there really isn't much that can be done on this account, and it wasn't so horrible. I managed to rest well. This isn't a resort on the beach, so don't expect that kind of a setting. But it is a lovely little boutique hotel that works hard to meet and exceed all your expectations.

We were welcomed with a glass of fresh-squeezed juice and cool washcloths at check-in, and the staff was wonderful. Extremely helpful and attentive. Lots of beach amenities - chairs, towels, body boards, etc - and a block from the beach make this one a good choice if you want to be right in the middle of everything. The room was a bit on the small side and the lighting wasn't particularly good, even in the bathroom. Actually, the whole property was pretty dark which was a bit strange. But the bed was incredibly comfortable and the bedding was nice and soft. We didn't spend much time in the room anyway so those things didn't matter much in the grand scheme. Breakfast didn't start until 7am which meant we sometimes missed it (we headed out early most days), and it was limited to tea/coffee and pastries so if you want a more substantial breakfast you'll have to go elsewhere. I appreciated the fact that they had hot water and ice water 24/7.We were able to get a fantastic price on this room - look online for promo codes before you book - but even without it would have been a good value given the location and in comparison to other nearby hotels. Independent hotels can sometimes be risky since we can't rely on brand recognition, but this was a decent choice.

The large plasma was great and the beds were comfy with the fluffiest quilts I have ever used, heaven! Air Con was a bit noisy but didn't have any problems sleeping with it on.The bathrooms have been remodelled and made a bit more modern. Good towels/robes/iron/ironing board provided. Little fridge was handy and enough space for our 3 suitcases. Amazing ocean view and good shutters to keep the room very dark when the sun came up. The pineapple juice and cool towels on arrival was a nice touch. All workers were friendly and reception were so helpful photocopying things for us for no charge and providing towels, beach chairs and a bottle opener for the wine we took up to our room. The iced lemon water/hot water was a bonus in the lobby too. The night we got there was their special cocktail night so we all got a free cocktail and free cheese/biscuits and salami which was lovely. Other nights they had happy hour $6 cocktails and cheap beer. One night even after the bar was closed a girl named Kasi stayed behind and made us cocktails/served drinks and bar snacks until well after closing time! She was so friendly and gave us a good overview of the island and interesting facts. She is an asset to the hotel and made us feel very welcome!The free breakfast consisted of coffee, tea, juice and sweet pastries and muffins. It would be 10000x better if they provided a bit of fruit/cereal or yoghurt instead because the pastries etc. were way too sweet and doughy! Can’t complain for a complimentary service though. The young girl serving there was also lovely too and always having a chat to us. Our room attendants were all VERY friendly and so kind and genuinely interested in talking to us.

The valet was always very quick with our car which was especially appreciated when we were pressed for time once or twice.

I normally look for a hotel with more of a restaurant/bar/outside patio in a location like this, but we really barely noticed as there is so much to do so close to the hotel. The location was really great for our purposes. The room was nicely decorated, comfortable and definitely large enough considering that we were there to be outside enjoying the sunshine. I will agree with other reviewers who mentioned that the room is a little dark as there were times I was digging through clothes looking for a pair of black socks, etc. and found it a little difficult.

I definitely appreciated the complimentary wireless internet, cold lemon infused water, breakfast (the hotel's website clearly states that includes coffee, tea and choice of pastries so I did not have expectations beyond that as some reviewers had) and beach gear.

It was great to not have to walk somewhere to buy coffee and put some food in your stomach, and was fast before heading out. ** TIP: breakfast is from 7-9:30 -- the pastry selection was much better between 7 and 7:30, and husband thought the coffee was better earlier on too.- beach mats, chairs, boogie boards, umbrellas, beach towels, were all available for free, which was also much appreciated. - water with lemon was set out after breakfast, GREAT to fill up water bottles and not have to buy water at ABC. - after checkout, they gave us a room for an hour to freshen up before our flight, so we could go to the beach one last time! CONS:- our room was smallest on floor (only one with balcony) and was tiny, and entry way and closet was super dark. Accent lighting was inadequate. - the refrigerator kept our water cold some days, but some days the fridge was hot. - our room was facing the busy street and the big hotel's loading docks were noisy first thing in the morning.

Our room was pleasing to the eye, but small enough that creativity was required for two of us to be able to open our bags at the same time. The bed was very good, and the staff unfailingly helpful. When we wanted a car for a couple of day’s tourism, the desk set us up with Enterprise, a short walk away, for $51/day. The hotel wants $25 per night for valet parking, but the front desk pointed us to nearby streets where parking is free 24/7.A couple of downsides: Our room came with a balcony affording a bit of ocean view. But the street below is so noisy that we never wanted to use it. For the same reason, we never left our windows open. The furnishings had a modern look, but we wondered if the interior designers had ever actually occupied the room for a night. The bedside shelf was high enough that I cracked my elbow into it more than once. The bathroom sink was not quite deep enough to prevent water from the high faucet from splashing out. There wasn’t an in-room coffee maker, and free morning coffee was not available till 7AM (an issue if you are a couple of hours jet-lagged). The breakfast bread and pastries were bad (the wife says “awful”). We bought granola parfaits at the ABC store next door. (ABC stores are everywhere!) The staff was nice enough to refrigerate them for us so we could pick them up at the front desk first thing in the morning. On the whole, it was a decent place to stay.

From arrival to departure they were all very helpful. They pointed out good spots to have food; be it lunch, dinner or even some casual drinks. The staff were more than happy to confirm our tours and activities for us, recommend other things for us to do and see and assist us with any queries. The rooms are lovely and serviced daily which was nice. The beds are amazing - the pillows not so much. Hotel Renew is in a good location being a 30 second walk from the beach and an easy walk to great shopping! Kasi - the bar tender- was especially awesome. Not only does she make wicked drinks she helped us locate a shop we didn't know was on Oahu and pointed out places and stuff to do on the second leg of our trip in Maui. You should let Kasi rock her Mohawk , its an extension of her personality and it's pretty and pink.

They great you at check in with fresh towels to freshen up and lovely pineapple juice. I am craving the juice to this day!

We loved our location, right across the road from the beach. Everything was in walking distance. We had a rental car to go to the North Shore and the Polynesian center. The valet parking was nice. I didn't have to worry about the car. In our room rate we were given beach mats and beach chairs. The room was set up well. The beds were comfortable and the room was clean. This was a great little boutique hotel, if you are looking for big name this is not for you. I loved it! I look for boutique hotels first, now every time I travel thanks to Hotel Renew. I love the little things, like the lobby bathroom was so modern and unique. We had 2 rooms and they accommodated us and gave us rooms across the hall from each other. The only problem we had was air conditioning in one room not working properly at first called the desk and maintenance was sent to the room in under 5 minutes. There was a little wear on the carpets. The humidity is wreaking havoc, but this was true in another hotel we stayed at as well. Because it is a small hotel there is not a view. The big chain hotels block the view.

If you want to get The Bus to Honolulu or Diamond Head there are plenty of lines just a short walk up the road but beware they can be very busy.We booked an ocean view room which was exactly what we got. We could watch the glorious sunset from our room if we were not still on the beach. The room itself was small by US standards but perfectly adequate for two people who were out most of the day. The TV was huge, great to watch the surfing channel on. The bathroom was modern and clean if again a little small. There was a little fridge we could put some drinks in to keep them cool. We slept well.While there is a complimentary breakfast it was all pastries which won't suit some but there are plenty of options within a short walking distance.

Prior to our arrival, it was suggested that we consider switching hotels to be a bit closer to the center of Waikiki. I am so glad we didn't heed that advice! The Renew was perfect in every way: price, size, location and service. The room was spacious and the bed was comfy. Service was friendly and attentive. As for some of the negative comments:-Noise: the street noise was indeed loud. I definitely heard the garbage trucks in the early morning but because of the jetlag coming from NYC, I was already up and didn't mind it. Perhaps, if you are sensitive to noise, you may want to bring ear plugs or consider a different hotel.- Location: I'm not quite sure what people mean by the ""seedy"" area of Waikiki Beach. The hotel may be closer to the Burger King than Bvlgari but it is by no means in a less than desirable location. I for one like being a little more removed from the crowds.- Breakfast: In the US, I never expect breakfast to be included with the daily rate. It was a pleasant surprise that the hotel provided coffee, juice and assorted pastries each morning. Were the pastries delicious? No, but they served a purpose. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Renew. I will take excellent service over a free breakfast any day!

Due to the issues listed below the hotel were willing to offer a refund as none of this was as described on the website. I liked the thought of a boutique theme, but in this case boutique hotel translate to quirks which are not in your favour and are generally annoying. As we couldn’t get a refund (we could by the hotel but since it went through hotels.com we couldn’t), we ended up paying for another hotel to simply get some sleep. This was a bit of an expense we had in the contingency fund, but when you add up the total spent, we could have stayed at the Royal Hawaiian and had a great time. Booking this hotel was a mistake. Lets get it out in the open, the hotel is around the medium to lower end of the places in Honolulu and thats quite frankly what we were aiming for, something nice and clean, relatively new just to chill out in and generally spend our time at the beach, have dinner and come back for a sleep. I chose this place over others around this price range because it has been renovated and it plays on the ‘Boutique’ thing. I’d not tried it before so I thought it would give it a shot. I know the area around there pretty well so I wasn’t concerned it would be a dodgy area. Having said that I do wish I had booked something else. The air con unit. Now some people like a hot room. I grew up in a cold climate so if there is a chance for ice hanging off the windows, I am all up for that. Now the air con unit did work (when we got our room switched) but these units were from the 80’s. Despite doing up the hotel, they kept all the original air con units which means they are noisy, a bit like a leaf blower right beside the bed. Now I am a heavy sleeper, but I could sleep through these, even with ear plugs. So for the sake of the compromise, I slept in a hot room. This isn’t the hotels fault, but the 4 surrounding hotels all have a loading bay and all the trash bins right next to the hotel. The Aston Waikiki, the Marriot which are near the beach and the one at the back. Now, this means reversing horns on all the lorries from about 5am. The trash does however get picked up at around 2-3am. This was made even more fun by a bathroom window above the trash area which didn’t close. It was one of those shutter windows. On top of that it didn’t have a blind so the street lamp outside shone in the room all night. And when the sun rose, it made the room nice and sunny. Perfect for wanting to get up at 5am which is exactly what you want to happen on holidays. Now for the fun part. I did go down to reception at 3am on the first night as I had literally just got off a very long flight and wanted a sleep and tried to get moved to another room. The ‘lovely’ lady in reception said ok we can do that but its going to cost you $70 for an upgrade. Now, at this point, I would have sold my granny to get to sleep but out of principal I said no and would come down in the morning, when I could have some breakfast and mull over whether it would be worth trying to get a refund from hotels.com and moving to another place. Which brings me to breakfast. As it said breakfast was included, I got excited. Throw me at a buffet breakfast or a continental and I am happy. I don’t ask for much, just some cereal, a piece of toast and some fruit, and maybe a cheeky Danish. However, when we got to breakfast there was 1 basket, a few cups and some orange juice. So, continental breakfast was......a Danish. And it wasn’t even a Danish. It was a white bun with some apple sauce in the middle. No cereal, no fruit, no bread for toast no nothing. This hotel doesn’t have a pool, which I knew about and that didn’t bother me since I knew we were so close to the beach. So all in all, the hotel did offer me a refund after the first night, it was however not possible to get one through hotels.com, so we made the most of our stay, with earplugs and Mai tais and eventually another hotel. We basically paid close to $1000 to not sleep for 3 days and it didn’t involve any crazy clubs, excessive consumption of any beverages or a wild time. A hotel in a very unfortunate location was to blame. The hotel has been done up very well but a few oversights in the planning mean it is noisier than some of the hostel in the area.

While overall it was fine, it wasn’t a great enough experience that would have me returning. So here are the pros and cons/things to know:Pros – As other have mentioned the pros are the location (close to the beach) and the service - everyone friendly and helpful. Overall room was fine, not big but not small.Cons/Things to know:1.Room – I didn’t find it that modern. Like many hotels in Waikiki this hotel is a renovation of an older building and it still has an old feeling. Yes they have spruced it up but they did not renovate (i.e. gut the old rooms), they spruced it up. Also it was very dark.2.Cleanliness/Bathroom– average. There was dirt on the bathroom walls, the shower had mold. Nothing special. Also as a boutique hotel I would expect more toiletries (it was sparse at best) – like separate shampoo and conditioner (combined shampoo and conditioner is the worse – I know its nitpicky but I don’t pack this stuff as I expect to be able to use the hotel’s stuff).3.Sound – you can hear everything which is a problem for a light sleeper like myself. I had a “city view” and one night people at the apartment behind us were outside partying until 5:00am. When they finally stopped it was time for the garbage trucks to come and start banging around (of note the garbage truck/delivery truck noise is not an issue specific to this hotel…it is endemic in Waikiki. That means unless you have paid for one of the higher priced better view rooms you will get this noise anywhere. Trust me I have stayed enough times to know this). The only thing that drowned anything out was the even noisier air conditioning.4.Breakfast – can’t rate it because every time we came down to grab something before we headed out the small area was chock full of people. Impossible to get at anything so we gave it a pass.5.Smell – musty smell in the room but that is on par for most hotels in Hawaii in the mid-range (I guess it’s called humidity).6.Amenities: No pool and we had no balcony – not necessary but even if my balcony looked onto nothing (which I have experienced in other hotels) it’s nice to just have a small outdoor space when you return to the hotel. But this is a personal preference.Overall it was fine. It’s hard to find a good place in Waikiki without spending a lot of money (see my other review on the Modern Honolulu).",Ottawa,"statters</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa</strong>",40,3.0

The hotel itself is much more modern then the other hotels in the area. There were some problems though. The shower head in my room was very loose and dropped water all over the place.

On checkout, the valet had brought my car up but when I walked outside with my 2 bags, he just handed me my keys and continued to text; no help with loading or even carrying them down the stairs.

We arrived around 6PM and were welcomed by Daniel and Adam (aka. Fancy Pants). We were given 2 glasses of cold and refreshing Pineapple juice, as well as a couple of cold towels... which we didn't really need as it was drizzling and chilly outside. We were given room 203 and immediately, Daniel asked if we needed to find some places to eat at. He pulled out a map and started circling where we should go based on what we said we liked. Not only that, but we were treated to a couple of drinks at the renew Lounge- which we utilized on our very last day. We had the Hawaii Gold beer... yum! Adam was waiting for us in the room, while already placing our suitcases on the luggage self. What service! Furthermore, he showed us the really great lighting features in the room, how to use the A/C unit andset up the wifi. He was so helpful and an absolute delight! We explored the room which was very clean and the large TV was such a treat. On our last day, we weren't leaving for the airport until PM. They were able to hold our luggage all day and when we were ready to go, Adam brought our heavy baggage out to the shuttle. That is certainly service at it's finest.LOCATION:Hotel Renew is literally a few steps from Waikiki beach. They provide towels, beach chairs, boogie boards, etc... for free! The beach and Kalakaua Ave. are mere steps away. You can walk to the International Marketplace, all of the shopping and restaurants as well. No car required. Furthermore, you're about a $12 cab ride to Diamond Head. In front of the neighboring hotel, you can catch the Waikiki Trolley. We only took the 'Pink' shopping line. It's $2 a ride, but it takes you right to the Nordstrom door of Ala Moana mall. BEDS:They were clean and very comfortable. The duvet covers were divine, especially if you keep the A/C on overnight. BATHROOM:Very clean and up to date. For a place near a beach, we didn't see anything wrong with it. VIEW:Unfortunately, our 2nd floor room faced the hostels and a very loud street. Our first night was really interesting. At about 6am, we could hear trucks unloading most likely for the ABC store next door. We also heard someone screaming pretty early in the am one day, but that's expected with the hostels across the way. We did get used to it and though we would have preferred a more quiet room, it didn't affect our stay. VALUE:For what we paid, this was more than worth it. The price was great and we really have nothing to complain about.STAFF:One word... WOW! We discussed that this is probably the best team we have ever encountered in all of our travels. Every one was so kind and sweet. They always made sure to smile, say ""hello"", help answer our questions and even opened the door for us every single time we were arriving or leaving. Anything we needed and asked for, they were able to deliver- no problem. Colby at the lounge was great and really took the time to get to know us. The same with Adam who we had the privilege of seeing almost every day. Thanks Fancy Pants!Nonetheless, we cannot thank all of you enough for making us comfortable and beyond content our entire stay!SUMMARY:This is a fantastic hotel in Honolulu. This was my second time, and in comparison to where I previously stayed, this wins hands down. We highly recommend that you consider Hotel Renew. It is in a perfect location, has great (high tech) rooms, very clean and above all, a first class family of staff who will take very good care of you. We are all for boutique hotels and this one certainly does not disappoint. We will definitely go back and stay here again!","Calgary, Canada","Sherio9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",3,5.0

It was our second time in Waikiki within about an eight day period, and we wanted to stay at a smaller hotel having spent two nights on the front end of our trip at the Moana Surfrider hotel. I am so glad we did this; the boutique hotel experience was a nice contrast to larger hotel experience that we had enjoyed. The staff was amazing at every turn. From check where they had delicious fresh drinks and wet towels for us upon arrival, to the help booking a tour we received, to the delicious drinks at happy hour, I can’t say enough good things about this hotel. The rooms aren't huge, they are cozy but they are very well designed to utilize the space. The decorations were nice and the hotel lobby was great. We arrived early and the hotel let us check in and upgraded us from 2 double beds to a king size bed which was a welcome surprise. We stayed at the hotel on the last day of our trip to Hawaii and our flight home wasn't until late in the evening on our checkout day. They were willing to give us a late checkout but suggested we may benefit more from use of the hotels courtesy room. This is a regular room that guests can “reserve” for an hour the day before after they have checked out, so that they can shower and change. I was delighted when the front desk person told me about this and willing to pay for the service, then they informed me this was a courtesy and there is no charge for the room. What a great amenity, this allowed us to do a tour that morning, go to the beach and swim and not have to fly home covered in sand. Even the bell hops seemed genuinely appreciative when we tipped them for storing our bags for us, and arranging transportation to the airport. The Hotel Renew isn't the biggest hotel, it doesn't necessarily have the best views (though we had a very nice view from our room), nor from the outside will it knock your socks off, but when you stay here you will have a great stay. I know that if I am back in Waikiki I would definitely like to stay here again.",Somervi,"Ben B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Somervi</strong>",3,5.0

Yes, there are tall hotels on each side but, you still have a great view of the activity on the beach,the surfers (surf school and board rentals about 2 blocks away), you can see the glass bottom subs out just a little ways.Our room was spacious,wonderful bed,each person had a soft, fluffy pillow and a firmer one,helps to meet everyones desire.Always had clean towels,they will change the sheets daily if you want,but didn't think that was neccessary,we don't do that at home.The staff was wonderful about getting us shuttles when we needed,and gave good information about things we ask about and sites to see.

This hotel was awesome the first time we stayed for our honeymoon, greeting us with freshly squeezed pineapple juice and ice cold towels, and friendly smiles. Waiting for us in our room was a bottle of champagne with chocolate covered strawberries, with a hand written personal note thanking us for our business. The rooms are very modern, comfortable, and the view in almost all the rooms is ocean. There isn't tons of people everywhere because it's a small boutique hotel, and everyone staying there seems to be open and friendly, just like the staff.You can rent for free bogie/surf boards, beach mats/chairs, towels, all for FREE! It's a miracle! Not to mention you're steps away from Waikiki Beach.The second time my husband and I stayed there, it was the same experience, just fabulous!The third time was the same experience, with appetizers sent to our room with a handwritten note, thanking us for our business again. This past time we stayed there we decided to go to happy hour. It has simple but delicious appetizers, and fabulous affordable drinks. Beers are $4 and cocktails are $6, which are fantastic prices for the area. Let me just say that the bartender, Jacqueline, made the BEST margarita I've ever had! This is coming from someone who makes handmade margaritas (I refuse to buy the mixes). It tasted super fresh and it wasn't weak, it had lots of tequila in it!Hotel Renew is a fantastic experience overall. They treat you like a celebrity, and have the ultimate customer service. You don't feel like just another tourist visiting Waikiki, but you feel valued and taken care of. I'll never stay anywhere else!

The location is perfect for a stroll through the central Waikiki area and although mostly quite busy, when we travelled (right after Thanksgiving and before school holidays) it was remarkably quiet.

The main thing is that the rooms are well appointed, clean, and comfortable, with fine toiletries, and it's less than three minutes in your flip-flops to the beach. And really that's all you want in a place like Honolulu. The other bright spot is the staff, which is extremely capable and friendly. Bright, however, is not a word to describe the halls, which are dingy and appear to belong to the mid-20th c. Breakfast is included, but this is limited to coffee and Costco-type pastries, which you consume on stools in a space just off the lobby.

The lounge is cute and they pour a decent cocktail and the room they let you stay in after you have checked out while waiting for your flight is a godsend. However, despite what you will read here on Tripadvisor it isn't perfect. Noise comes into the rooms very easily, either from other rooms or from the street. Neither the television nor the AC worked entirely properly during my whole stay but as I could ""figure it out"" I never complained. There is also a bit of wear and tear to be found in the form of water damage, cracks in the wall and whatnot. Nothing to make you rethink your stay but definately enough so that you do notice it.

Sadly, Leonor left this hotel 2 years ago, but her training of the Front Desk staff is still very much in evidence. Special mention this time to Chris & Adam, who were just super friendly & helpful, but Kudos must go to Jackie, who bent over backwards to make sure we were comfortable in our room, found the best places to eat, went on the right buses to go to the Mall & just generally made any question we had, no trouble to find the answers.The rooms have certainly changed since 2007 with some nice renovations to them, also the front lobby. My husband & I were on a cruise to celebrate our 35th Wedding Anniversary & then stayed 3 nights at the hotel after the cruise. The Management acknowledged our special occasion, by sending a small plate of cheese, meat & crackers to our room.Apart from the great customer service, it's the location of this hotel to Waikiki Beach. It is less than half a block & is quite reasonably priced, I imagine. I have to admit, I liked the prices in 2007 better. And as mentioned by others, the Continental Breakfast is really just juice, danish & sweet rolls. But, a great bonus as before, we were able to have our luggage kept secure for us by the Hotel, while we spent our last day in Honolulu & then were given the use of a room to shower, change & get ready for our late night flight back to Canada.

There are some good restaurants with entertainment and a nice vibe such as Tiki's bar and grill at the Aston Waikiki and Lulu's Waikiki which is in the same block. The food at the Wolfgang puck express below the the Aston was not good and I would avoid it if you can.

Read a number of the reviews and decided to stay at this hotel. Some of the reception staff was lovely, especially Adam. The hotel is boutique style and appears to be a renovated and done up hotel with a few areas showing the cracks since it opened a couple of years ago. We got a city view room as we had previously stayed in an ocean front room in another hotel. The room is on the small side but acceptable. Air-con makes this on and off loud rumble which is quite annoying, sounds like the air con is on its last leg... Bathroom is ok, but beware your items on the shelf separating the sink and toilet may accidentally fall into the toilet when u reach for it on the sink side - design flaw but i guess it makes the bathroom look bigger. Funny do not disturb card which actually says the room is being made up for the next guest so do not disturb... we didn't know whether to use it as a 'do not disturb' card or not... Got woken up by housekeeping at 845am in the morning, not impressed... Beware the walls are actually quite thin - we could hear every word and 'activity' of our neighbours when we walked pass their room in the corridor... Free wifi was good but had to log in every time. We saw the tiny size of the breakfast area so we didn't even take on the free breakfast deal seeing there were all sorts of choices in Waikiki. Good location half a block from the beach and practically right next to the trolley stop. Lovely for hotel to provide beach towels, mats and boogie boards. Overall ok stay but didn't really think it lived up to its No.5 ranking (i guess people with ocean view will probably rank them higher).

Our room was on 4th floor and our view was of parking lot and apartments. The halls was dark and I dont think the hotel had security. The room was too small to spend a week in comfortably.

Clean, modern room, nicely equipped bathroom, comfy bed, free wifi. The front desk was super helpful from the first call I made to reservations until the day I checked out. Breakfast is free: coffee, tea, juice, fresh pastries. I was on California time so I was up a bit early and they happily got me hot water while they were setting up. I only got to the beach once, but they eagerly provided me with towels and a beach mat. They also had boogie boards. Housekeeping was super efficient and friendly, never bothering me when the Do Not Disturb sign was up, which is VERY important on a business trip when I'm trying to catch a nap before evening meetings/functions. If you're looking for a resort-type hotel, this isn't it for you...there's no room service, no restaurant or pool and it is a half a block walk to the beach. But I was glad to trade that for the lovely room, friendly service and NO moldy smell, which is prevalent in even some of the bigger resort hotels. I also love that you can open the window to let in the warm, fragrant Hawaiian breezes. My only con? Paoakalani Street is on the Trolley route, so it gets quite noisy during the day if you're on the street side. Also, there are a couple of hotels on the corner, one that has a very loud karaoke bar, but that closes at 10pm. Although if you're on the street side, you get a view of the ocean. However, that's Waikiki for you, even at the Sheraton on the beach, the noise down at the bar and on the boardwalk floated up to our room, even on the 10th floor.I'd stay here again if I had to come back to Waikiki!","Los Angeles, California","lilfoodiegirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",53,4.0

At the counter, I was greeted and welcomed back just like an old friend. A couple of minutes after I walked in my room, a knock on my door...a staff with a bowl of fresh mixed fruits with a personal note welcoming me back. Very nice touch!!. The friendly staff are always very helpful in either asking for directions, recommending restaurants or look up something for you online. The free breakfast is served from 7 to 9:30 and can get crowded fast but you can take your food to your room.My recommendations to first time visitors to this hotel:If you're a light sleeper, ask for a room on a higher floor preferably facing Waikiki Beach since the hostel on Lemon can get noisy sometimes at night.If you like your room real cold, this hotel may not suit you and the A/C will be running non stop.FYI: The hallways on each floor have no A/C vents and can get real warm but I have no problem with that.Don't rent a car if you just plan to stay around Waikiki. Most tour and public buses pick up passengers just a few yards in front of the hotel. If you want to rent, Hotel Renew provides valet parking but has very limited parking spaces and not cheap. If you must rent, rent a car for a day(get it early) and return it late the same day to avoid parking fee. I even know a car rental company that will pick up and drop you off.I can't wait to go back and enjoy Oahu and Hotel Renew again and again.One thing I hate to write a great reviews on Hotel Renew is that my chances of getting a room on specific days get slimmer as more people book when more favorable reviews are posted. :)","Dallas, Texas","Louie R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",14,5.0

They did and then some. For 8 days, my girlfriend and I enjoyed what must be the best little boutique hotel on all the islands. The staff is so accommodating (Grace and Adam are the best!) you would think you are the only guest in the hotel. I inquired into the best golf courses and sushi restaurants and within 10 minutes the wrote out the best spots in town. The rooms are clean, modern, updated, and the bed was probably the most comfortable I've ever slept on. No need to run to Starbucks or Seattle's Best Coffee. The Kona coffee they serve for free downstairs is great, and so is the pineapple juice, and pastries/muffins. What I loved most is how close is it to the beach, and how easy it is to get in and out of the room. I travel a lot for my career and am so tired of the big, huge hotel chains where no body knows you nor cares, and it takes a week getting to your room or getting your rental car.

I want so badly to say I love it and I would be back every time here and all, but truth is, I probably won't. The hotel itself has been recently renovated, but it doesn't quite give the feel of a luxury hotel...i'm not sure if that makes sense, so i guess you would have to experience it to understand. The elevators clank, the air condition rattles and rumbles - not a lushous hotel, water leaked fr the faucet, but it's not bad - just above average. Maybe the professional photos of the hotel gave me false expectations and anticipations...plus, being ranked #5 on tripadvisor too may've made my expectations really high of the hotel itself - for the hotel itself, i would give it a strong 3 stars.The customer service, however, is where this hotel is very strong at - I have never experienced such amazing customer service at a hotel - the staff were all super friendly. It was my boyfriend's birthday and everyone knew it was his birthday and was wishing him a happy birthday which I was amazed about. Valet was super fast and super friendly. Five stars for sure for the staff here at hotel renew - which averages out to 4 stars overall. I say I wouldn't stay here the next time I'm in Honolulu bc I do personally like a little more luxury in the hotel itself. But overall, a great hotel.",,Cindy C,22,4.0

However, you'll not miss any of the above: Waikiki beach and with its protected waters is 50 steps away, there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance+they serve a small continental breakfast from 7am (toast, muffins, croissants, yogurt, coffee & pineapple juice) and they have wi-fi in every room. We got the King Ocean View room on the 6th floor. Our rooms was very clean and the bed is pretty big and comfy- but the room was a little bit cramped . And as others have observed, the next-door Aston hotel tends to get in the way of your ocean view -so do make sure you are on the upper floors. (6th and above). These are minor points- like us, if you plan to spend very little time indoors, you have nothing to much to worry.Staff are very friendly and helpful- on learning it was our honeymoon they sent up champagne to our rooms.One complaint is that there is no microwave oven available to the guests (not even in the kitchenette that serves breakfast in the lobby) , would be good if management addresses this- we could not reheat our leftover chicken wings :(","Sunnyvale, California","Bharatan K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunnyvale, California</strong>",9,4.0

The rooms are clean and modern with a generous bathroom and super comfy bed. We took a 9th floor room to take advantage of the view straight down to the beach which is a two minute walk away.As the other reviews have said the staff are fantastic. We had a wobbly towel rail which we mentioned to reception and it was fixed by the time we were back in half an hour. They also helped out organising shuttles and making recommendations.The wifi is great, fast and free. Take advantage of the included continental breakfast each morning as it's an easy way to get yourself fed before starting the day. It can be a scramble for seats but if you pick the time right it's easier. You can also borrow beach towels, chairs and mats from reception for the beach which is so handy.A few things to have a think about when making your decision. The 9th floor sea view rooms do not have a balcony which I didn't think would be a problem but I did miss it. You can't actually see the view from the bed so basically you have to stand at the window to look out. It would have been really nice to sit out on a little balcony in the morning and evenings before heading out. This single factor would be a sticking point for us when deciding to stay here again (although value for money wise it's still excellent).Also the hotel doesn't offer tea and coffee facilities. Just the like the balcony it's made quite clear in the room amenities but again in practice I missed being able to put a cuppa on! You can pay for a dodgy coffee from a machine in reception but a kettle and some tea bags would be nice. And there is no pool, you don't need it with the beach two minutes away for swimming. But without a balcony or a pool or external bar there was nowhere outside to sit so you were either out and about or tucked away inside the hotel missing out on the atmosphere.The noise level in the hotel is great, super quiet, no inter-room noise. We did find our air conditioner in the room noisy though and it took a few nights to get used to it. And the hotel next to Hotel Renew serenades its poor guests with singing and dancing at breakfast, rain or shine which unfortunately means you also get sung awake at 7am every morning. Be warned!Overall the hotel offered excellent value for money and was well appointed, nice and modern, unlike so many of the other ones we were looking at for the same price. The staff were a stand out. However do think about the boutique nature of the hotel and make sure you're happy with what you don't get in return for the benefits.",Auckland,"LakeSmith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland</strong>",20,4.0

I was quite nervous before, but all my worries were just blown away. Hotel Renew was great! I have to say it was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at and I have been in a few. We have had an upper floor, city view room, the hotel is really just steps from the beach so it is not a big deal not to stay in ""beach front"", because all the beach front hotels have the busy main street in front of them anyway!!! so it was quite nice to be not in the first row but still not far away. The hotel inside is new or renovated, however it´s really nice, no big hawaiian designs but just nice stylish room, HUGE and sooo comfy bed, nice bathroom and a small hallway with a wardrobe, there is a small drink fridge so you can put some fruit there or so too. The staff was friendly and helpfull, you can have some beach chairs and towels for free - it was great as people pay for hiring these on the beach like 50 $ a day... It was really quite, we have never heard anything from other rooms or so. The breakfast buffet is quite small but was enough for us but it is happening in the hotel lobby (the hotel is quite small compare to other ones in Hawai´i so there is no restaurant) and there is not enough chairs for all the people I would say, we were lucky to have a seat every time but I saw few people waiting for a bit. But as I saw the bigger hotels they even had a queue in front of the restaurants so than I thought this wasn´t so bad, some of these hotels are promising ""take away breakfast"" on the beach - but it is just because you actually have to take all you can before somebody else will do it and you go to find yourselves spot on the beach, because there is no room for you in the restaurant.Hotel great value for the price, I would recommend it for sure, it´s for someone who likes a bit of a privacy and who likes to stay in a nice place on a holiday (for me it just makes the whole thing much better). It is not an empty luxury, you don´t pay the extra $$ for some chandelier or so, but you have all you need - I mean, you are mainly spending time outside anyway but you are gonna feel good inside too. I think for this money this is the gem, and BIG plus - it really looks just like on the internet websites pictures. We just had a great time, we loved Hawai´i, we traveled all around the Ohau Island but we liked just to stay on the Waikiki beach as well, it may be crowded for some people, but I think it´s not worse then when you live in Europe and go to Croatia for a holiday - I thought it is gonna be much worse, like more people, so I really liked it the way it was, the place - beach, main road - is alive but not annoying. I would definitely stayed again, thank you all from the staff for helping us to have the best holiday time, Aloha from Barbora & Josef!!","Kaikoura, New Zealand","BJBradac</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaikoura, New Zealand</strong>",1,5.0

If this is very important to you, you may be disappointed (although it is still only a block to walk to the beach).Other than that issue, I was very impressed with the customer service, and the design of the hotel. It feels like a small, more expensive stylish boutique. Our room had some scuffs and dings and not totally clean mirrors, but it was fairly minor.

Staff is very friendly and professional. We booked a double bed with partial ocean view but that was our first mistake.The guy who checked us in said (almost apologizing) that we have a double bed but the great thing about our room is the balcony. When we get to the room (301), we are happy, on the small side but clean/stylish. Downer #1: We are a small/average size couple and the double bed was way too small. It took some getting used to for sure.Then our balcony with partial ocean view - if you have to pay extra for it, not worth it. You have to lean over the railing to see the view and the high rise hotel next door has a great view of you. No intimate evenings out there. Great for families with small children since the balcony is concrete and kids can be out there safely without danger of falling through railings. Can imagine it would be great for a smoker too.Cool lighting system, effective shades (that you will never open because you are surrounded by lanais) and Face Stockholm products.Biggest complaint - moldy smell in the room. We told reception about it. They did a ""deep clean"" but really didn't help. We stayed 3 nights and since we only had one more night, we tolerated it. Maybe coming from the carpet or a/c. Def a negative.Overall, not bad. Renew was so close the beach w/ free beach towels, boogie board & breakfast so if you are not staying too long, it's great.

The hotel offers beach towels, beach chairs, beach mats and boogie boards for the asking.The room provided all the basic needs – the bed was clean and comfortable, the AC worked fine.Breakfast is a continental breakfast (cereal, pastries, juice, coffee) from 7am to 9:30am. Sometimes we were gone before 7am; so you’ll have to find breakfast somewhere else (McDonald’s, Leonard’s bakery, etc.) if you leave early. There was always adequate seating when we were there at 7am, but there is seating for only about 10-12 people.Thursday night is happy hour with a complimentary drink for the evening – the Blue Hawaiian served by the bartender was very good.There are lots of restaurants nearby - Teddy's Burgers, Subway, McDonald's, Cheeseburger in Paradise are good choices. The not so good:The room can be noisy, even with the AC running. I suggest keeping the bathroom door closed (much of the noise enters through the bathroom window) and set the AC fan for “on” so that it runs continuously.There are no TV listings so that you have to sort through all the channels to find which ones you want.There is a $25 per day fee for parking. It’s valet parking and they always did a nice job getting the car when requested. You won’t find any free or discount parking in Waikiki, so this is really your only option if you have a rental car, which I highly recommended.The room lighting is dismal, bring a flashlight. I wasn’t able to see the safe in the closet without a flashlight. The room lighting options are dim and dimmer.The shower has such a low flow that it was difficult to clean up after a day at the beach.Our room didn't have a good view, but the view from the beach was excellent.Summary: A good value for the location; it’s clean, comfortable and provides good access to the beach.

This is a small hotel, about a block from Waikiki Beach. We were assigned a room on the top floor (9th floor) and our room didn't have a view, but to us, that didn't matter. Each floor appeared to have fewer than 10 rooms, which meant that, for us, it was a very quiet hotel. I am a light sleeper, and I found that I heard no noise at all during the night, even from other guests/rooms on our floor, which is rare. The front desk staff during our stay were all helpful and friendly, with advice regarding where to eat dinner, which shuttle service to use, etc. The front desk also provides free beach towels, mats, chairs and boogie boards for your use. The location of this hotel was great for us - not on the noisiest, busy street, but close enough to walk to many of the restaurants/sights on Waikiki Beach. At least from our room on the 9th floor, we didn't hear any street noise. It was also a good location for picking up a tour bus (Roberts Hawaii) which stopped just a few steps from the front door of Hotel Renew, which took us to an evening dinner cruise on the Ali'i Kai catamaran (see separate review - great cruise!). The free breakfast buffet each morning was more than adequate for us - juices, coffee, croissants, assorted danish and pastries, toast/toaster, cereals, fresh fruit, etc.Our first afternoon, we met the maid for our floor, who introduced herself, and indicated she would be the maid on our floor for our stay, which I thought was nice. The hotel also has a cocktail hour in their small bar, also in the lobby, each evening. The evenings we were there, the cocktails were not complimentary, but that didn't bother us. It was nice to be able to get a drink without leaving the hotel. Things to note: This hotel does not have a pool. We were more interested in the Pacific Ocean, just a block away, than in a pool. Also, there is no concierge desk, as there is with many Waikiki hotels. But, the front desk did assist when we asked them for help with recommendations or arrangements. Also, they do charge for parking the car in the hotel garage overnight. My recommendation is not to rent a car at the airport, but first to take the shuttle to the hotel when you get to Honolulu, and walk around the city or take a bus for the first couple/few days. Then, when you want to get out of the city, rent a car at one of the car rental agencies near the hotel, so you don't have to pay for parking overnight on the days you are just in town, at the beach. Also, around the corner from the front door of the hotel is a place you can rent bikes or mopeds - we didn't realize this until the day we were leaving. It might have been fun to rent one or the other if we had been here another day. Also, literally right next door is the ABC store - which are in abundance in Hawaii - they have everything from beach towels to liquor here. Almost anything you could need you should be able to pick up there. Finally, I would say this hotel is better suited to couples or singles, or to business travelers, rather than to families with very young children. Its decor is very stylish and modern, and there was a couple with a toddler staying here when we were, and it didn't seem to be a good fit for their needs, to me. It's probably fine for pre-teens or teens, though. We were here with our college-age son, and it worked fine for us. I would definitely recommend this hotel to other travelers to Waikiki, who don't want the gigantic hotel experience. We were very happy with our stay.",FL,"nfall2010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>FL</strong>",89,4.0

Loved the contemporary style and boutique-sized hotel, and the entire staff were always friendly, smiling, and helpful. Valet parking ($25/day) was quick and simple, well worth the convenience, especially in Waikiki. The inclusive continental breakfast was excellent with ample selection of cereals, pastries, fruits, juices, coffee, etc. Cool towels and juice provided at check-in was a pleasant personal welcome after the long flight. The bed was so comfortable and our room was quiet and spotlessly clean. If you want the big, noisy, lost-in-the-crowd, resort-style accommodations of Waikiki, then stay elsewhere.

The outside of the hotel looks like an inexpensive apartment building, but as they always say ""don't judge a book by it's cover."" A doorman took our bags out of our cab and brought them inside before I even realized (which confused me for a minute :) ), we walked inside and it was instantly a very different vibe.The lobby was small but modern and sleek with high ceilings. The staff was very friendly and we were greeting at the counter with fresh glasses of pineapple juice and cool damp towels. The asked if we were on our honeymoon and we excitedly agreed. We went on up to our room and it was very modern and sleek to match the lobby. One thing I didn't like was the room was pretty dim even with the lights on the bright setting (but that's my only complaint really). The bed came with the most comfortable down comforter I've ever used, it was like a cloud! The a/c was effective and a little noisy but the white noise is good to tune out some of that city noise (the most noise we heard was our first night out of four there was a garbage truck early in the morning but it was quick and we easily went back to sleep). The room had a button system for the lights which was really handy and cool, there was a set of buttons on each side of the bed and at the door. Each controlled the lights by ""bright"" ""night and ""just right"" and there was a more detailed one by the side of the bed to turn on and off specific lights. Everything was very clean and up to date and very modern. The staff was very friendly throughout our entire stay, and they even sent up a complimentary bottle of champagne about 20 minutes after we arrived with a hand written card congratulating us. We did use the valet parking (the only parking available) for $25/night. Street parking is available but is ran by meters, so it wasn't worth the hassle. Overall a great, friendly boutique hotel. Would definitely recommend for couples.No pool, no restaurant (small bar in the lobby).The hotel is one very short block from the end of waikiki beach (about two blocks from the zoo).

We also found a fun old school steakhouse in the Ohana East and the worlds smallest karaoke bar called Wang Chungs. We really enjoyed all the free loan beach equipment and even took some of it with us when we explored the North Shore. You need to checkout the beaches on this part of Oahu. We let them know it was our anniversary and they sent us up a bottle of wine and they found out it was also my birthday one day and sent up another treat that day. Breakfast was ok. Yes it was a small area but most mornings we just took it up to our room. Housekeeping did a great job and the front desk was very helpful with booking outings if you needed that kind of service.

The room itself was very clean - the shower amazing and the twin double beds extremely comfortable. The in room fridge is great for storing water etc. The welcome book provides a good place to start for information as where to go/what to do and the hotel has leaflets at the front desk if you need more information.Breakfast is served until 9.30am - I recommend you get downstairs early as in peak season there is limited space to sit. The breakfast itself is good - cereal, fruit, tea, coffee, juice, toast and muffins - all very adequate. The hotel offers beach towels, mats, chairs and boogie boards which I'd recommend using as there isn't really anywhere in your room to hang wet towels - i.e. no balcony - its the same for swim suits/bikinis - they do dry - we hung ours on the air con system but it will take a while to dry. The air con in the rooms is good but requires some fiddling to get the temperature right. The hotel has a 'happy hour' from 5.30 - 7.30pm and whilst it is more a 'quiet drink' than a raving social event, it's a good way to start your evening with cheap cocktails at $6. All staff are very friendly and do their best to answer your questions etc. They were very helpful when it came to going home, providing storage for cases and getting taxes for you - around $40 to the airport. Cleaning staff are also very good - daily room cleaning with change of towels etc. The map provided in your room is a good start for getting around - although for buses come out of the hotel entrance, turn right, walk up the street, walking past lemon street up to Kuhio Avenue - first major street running parallel - and you can pick up all major buses from any stop along that street. For buses its $2.50 - keep the ticket because you can use it on another journey within the time frame given at the top. Most buses go to the Ala Moana centre - big massive shopping centre and then transfer there to get another bus out to places such as North Shore, Moana Falls and other beaches on the island. Bus travel is possible around the island but be prepared to spend a few hours travelling and waiting for buses - buses to North shore and Lanikai and Kailua beach run 1 every hour - worth the visit - one of the top ten beaches in the world, sandy banks, blue waters - no rocks. If you can car hire is the best option but you an enjoy the view on the bus too.

The room had everything I needed. Breakfast was offered starting at 7:00 a.m. -- fresh fruits, juices, muffins, toast, cereal, yogurt, coffee, etc. My first priority was the beach and the Hotel Renew supplied a beach towels and beach chair at no charge. I went to the beach my first and second days. Upon my return the second day, the staff greeted me by name! I was a bit surprised! I was there several days before going to Kauai for several days. After Kauai, I returned to the Hotel Renew to claim my same room with a view with which I had fallen in love. I was greeted again by name. Nice! If I were to change one thing about the hotel it would be to have breakfast (or at least coffee) offered earlier. Many of us are on mainland time so we're up early! This would space out the diners so everyone didn't arrive at the same time and take up all the seats -- yes, the breakfast area was a bit crowded at times. Because I was up and ""attem"" by six every day, I was also out exploring. I found several breakfast places for more hearty breakfasts -- one that had an authentic Japanese breakfast (which I love) just around the corner. Since the Hotel Renew did not have a restaurant, I enjoyed exploring other meal options. Right next door was a hotel with an excellent bar overlooking Waikiki Beach (EXCELLENT BLOODY MARYS) and an delicious calamari appetizer. Not far in any direction were wonderful restaurants and shopping. The trolley stop was just steps away from the main entrance of the hotel so I could (and did) go anywhere I wanted on a free or cheap trolley. As far as I'm concerned, this was the perfect hotel for me in terms of price, amenities, and location. I hope to go back to Oahu again and when I do, I will stay at the Hotel Renew.

There were a couple of negatives - firstly the sound of the garbage truck in the side street which lasted for 1 hour (no joke) at 7am Sunday morning. It's a city, so there's going to be noise, but 1 hour of constant screeching on a Sunday morning was a bit much. If I was going to stay here again I'd fork out a bit extra for an ocean view room which I assume also has less traffic noise, however the whole point was that we wouldn't be spending much time in the hotel to justify having a view - we'd only be there at night!The other negative was the noisy air conditioning in the room. It was so noisy we turned it off just before going to sleep, which is fine except when waking up in a hot stuffy room and no windows to open. There was also other noises throughout the night, water running form people having showers at 2am etc. Apart from these things our stay was good, would probably stay elsewhere next time though, high up!","Melbourne, Australia","Caroline P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",5,3.0

He recommended an amazing (non-touristy) restaurant for the night, which bars and good+cheap drinks, where to go in Waikiki. He really made our experience worth-while! The negatives: Our AC was not very powerful. The streets are noisy.

I was also right next door to the hotel (we didn't so I can't comment on how they were). We did enjoy going to Lulu's Grill for breakfast and lunch at Tiki's Grill & Bar and Teddy's Bigger Burgers which were a few of the closest restaurants to the hotel.They had a decent spread for a continental breakfast but if you have dietary restrictions like I do, you'll probably need to go out. They did have a nice selection of tea and both regular and decaf coffees. If you want cocktails before heading out, do try the bar downstairs. I had a couple of cocktails at the bar during happy hour and they were really good, especially the pineapple mojito. The front desk will provide you with beach mats and/or chairs along with towels so don't worry about bringing any unless you plan to go on outside excursions after you check out. I gave Hotel Renew five stars because they are upfront about what they are and do (a boutique hotel with good rooms, not a resort) and they do it well.

I wasn't expecting ocean front views from a hotel that's a block off the beach so we thought the ability to see the water was very nice.Waikiki in general is very noisy so unless you have a room with double paned windows, expect to be awakened by pedestrians, blaring radios, garbage trucks, etc. That's why I rated ""sleep quality"" as average but I think most hotels in Waikiki suffer equally in this regard. The hotel itself was pretty quiet internally when we were there. We didn't notice noise through the walls or excess noise in the hallways.The hotel room was in good shape with a nice modern decor. There was some wear and tear in the room but generally I felt like it was in good shape. The bed was very large and very comfortable.

Location, price and reviews were foremost in my mind at the time. Having since returned home I am still happy with that choice. It is on the left hand side of Paoakalani Ave immediately behind the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel which fronts both Kalakaua and Paoakalani Aves. Both hotels face the beach. On the other side of Paoakalani is the Waikiki Beach Marriott which also fronts Kalakaua Ave and the beach. The Hotel Renew may be a new hotel or simply a renovated one as the name implies but is nonetheless of a boutique style of a good standard and has very friendly and helpful staff. Our room 706 was modest in size but very modern with a sweeping view down Paoakalani Ave to the Ocean and was one of the few with a balcony giving restricted views of Diamond Head. It does overlook the pool of the Aston Waikiki Beach from which live band music floats up at night and the roar of motor bikes were often heard from the street late at night. The tarfiff was US$196 per night which included a light breakfast in a small breakfast annex. Such comprised juice, fruit, cerial, pastries, cakes, toast, tea or coffee. Having just come of a 18 night cruise up from Sydney on the Radiance of the Seas it was a relief for us to be restricted to a light wholesome light meal that was more than sufficient for us to start our day. Otherwise there is no restaurant and no pool in the hotel. However it does offer a happy hour for cocktails late afternoon in the same area as the small breakast annex. My only problem with the room was the airconditioning and the bedding. Each room has an air conditioner immediately below the window and adjacent to the king bed. We found it to be a little noisy and our sleep was repeatedly broken as it went through its dormant and cooling cycles finding ourselves constantly thowing back and then retrieving the covers. It was too warm to simply turn it off and open the window to the small amount permitted. Such would have also allowed more noise to enter. The mattress and the pillows are feather and I found the latter gave little support to my neck which again caused aches and broken sleep. I was therefore often tired by early evening. A request for a firmer pillow only yielded more of the same type. No amount or combination improved the support. Would I stay there again. Yes! Not being lazy and taking time to better set the airconditioner would have helped. However I guess I would simply have to put up with their pillows.","Mollymook, Australia","Ken S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mollymook, Australia</strong>",33,4.0

The hotel provided a very comfortable & cozy place for our family of 4 to rest each night. The hotel is nicely located quite close to Waikiki beach and the Honolulu Zoo. Upon our arrival, we were greeted with very friendly staff. After a long day of travel with a 4 hour time zone change, it was a pleasure to experince the friendliness and hospitality from the staff at this boutique hotel. They were very helpful & informative while getting us settled and checked into our room. Throughout the week, we really appreciated having beach chairs, beach mats and boogie boards available to us! The continental breakfast provided each morning was nice however sometimes having a place to sit while eating proved to be a challenge for our family of 4. The rooms were clean and modern. Hats off to Adam, Chris & Daniel! The service these guys provided was excellant! They are so kind, so friendly and hospitable!

On arriving in the room, we observed the view and while you can technically see the ocean (sort of), the hotel is set back from the water a little bit and the neighbouring hotels block the view quite a bit, so don’t expect much frontage. Also the hotel doesn’t have balconies so you may want to consider this if that’s your thing.The bed was king size, very soft and comfortable! One of the best we’ve ever experienced. Room was suitably dark for a sound sleep with the slide shutter blinds closed. As much as we tried to get up and start the day many sleep-ins were had, but that’s what holidays are all about. Only issue was the noise from the street as it is close to the main road and the trolley cars come down the street and insist on ringing their bells loudly several times. Some of the neighbouring hotels also had bands and on some busy nights the clientele felt amorous and wanted to tell this to the world. Fortunately the more than adequate air conditioning, when kept on all night, drowned out much of the noise.Room was a good size and had a huge flat screen television with plenty of channels to watch. Decor was very modern looking inside with recent furniture and custom controlled lighting. Bathroom was up-to-date and kept clean with plenty of toiletries and towels. Shower water pressure could be better though, but adequate.As we were aware that this is a boutique hotel we knew there is no pool or gym. Continental breakfast was served daily up until 9:30am, but it could get busy with many people staying. The bar was cosy and happy hour good to take advantage of after a hard day sightseeing or shopping. There were great cocktails to pick, but not too much variety with beer choices (eg no lager, but plenty of pale ale!).Staff members were friendly and pleasant making our stay relaxed and enjoyable. Grace, on the front desk, in particular helped us book some tours to explore the island and provided us with printed information about each one to help us choose. Jason, the fellow Aussie, behind the bar helped us with advice on what to see and where to eat.If you want to go for a swim at the beaches, just make sure you ask the locals, or at least experiment with different spots as some are better than others!Overall enjoyable stay at a very comfortable, friendly hotel that we recommend you consider staying at.","London, United Kingdom","ccranny01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",46,4.0

Check-in was efficient and friendly. The hotel offers beach towels at the front desk. Breakfast was continental style with fruits, pastries, coffee, tea, juices, yogurt, and cereal; Nice and light. Breakfasts are free as is the wi-fi in the rooms. Parking is $25 per day which sucks, would have liked to have it included in some sort of room packages or free for customers staying at the hotel. Bellhop (Chris) was very helpful and friendly. The room was very clean and modern, except for the a/c. A/C is not central but the unit-kind which doesn't do a very good job of keeping the room temp stable. It was cold and hot on-and-off through out the night.

Noise wasn't too much of a problem; we didn't heard any neighbors, there is some noise from the opposing hotel during the night, but it's not super loud or anything.

We were on the 5th floor. On arrival we were checked in very early which was really appreciated after the flight from Australia. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful throughout our entire stay, booking a hire car for us and providing maps of places to go. The room was very clean and the housekeeping throughout our stay was fantastic. The location is also really good being 2 mins from the beach, and a short walk into the heart of Waikiki. We also ate at the Tiki bar next door which was great. The bed as previously mentioned is very comfortable. Now for the bad - the street noise is so loud, I had to sleep with earplugs in. My husband struggled to get sleep. There are constant dings from trolleys, loud trucks, and late at night people carrying on out in the street. You also get lots of noise from Tikis next door with loud music late into the night. The airconditioning was also incredibly loud and we couldn't have this on at night, which made it quite hot and I wouldn't want to be there in summer. The walls are also very thin and you can hear everything in the hallways and rooms next door and get woken early. The shower room was really dark and needed additional lighting. Also the water pressure was terrible.Breakfast was also disappointing - we never got to sit down and enjoy it as there was never anywhere to sit. So we just grabbed a coffee/juice on the way out each day. There was a small selection of cereal and pastries. There is also no pool, which we didn't think we would care about, but the beach was having maintenance work while we were there and a pool would've been very welcome on the hot days. For the price we paid I think the location is great, but I think if we were looking for a budget option next time we would try one of the hotels a street back from the beach, like Hilton Waikiki Beach which we had friends stay at and was great. Unfortunately I don't think the noise is something they can address here so if you are a deep sleeper or get a well located room than you may be okay.","Brisbane, Australia","Antsuz78</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",251,3.0

The air conditioning was a little loud at night when we were trying to go to sleep but other than that it was a great room. The breakfast in the morning had a good selection for food but we stayed 4 nights and had a bit of trouble each morning trying to get a seat. There is only seating for about 10 people in the lobby area and this was a little annoying having to hover around waiting for someone to leave. We ended up going else where most mornings.

They even offered to store and keep watch of my friends bicycle. The hotel offers clean beach towels and boogie boards free. The breakfast was good and adequate to get the day started. The only issue was finding a place ot sit as it gets crowded for breakfast. My recommendation is to get there early to ensure you get a seat. The room was a premium ocean view room with a king size bed on the 6th floor. It was very modern and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and I liked the fact that there are rolling shutters on the windows. These rooms look out into the pool area of the Aston Waikiki and then to the ocean beyond. The bathrooms could use more lighting, especially in the shower. It was a bit dark, even with both sets of lights turned on. The A/C is a bit loud in the room but I didn't mind it so much because it drowned out the noise coming from the outdoor bar at the Aston at night. There is no swimming pool at this hotel. Personally, I prefer the beach anyway and so that was not an issue for me. Finally, the hotel is very close and within walking distance to the beach, park, aquarium, zoo, and many nice restaurants.

We were greeted during check-in with a glass of refreshing pineapple juice and a cool lemongrass-scented towel for freshening up, and given a map detailing many attractions in the area with explicit instructions on which bus routes went there and where to catch those buses. Since we like to use public transportation, we found this invaluable. The lobby area is very comfortable and attractive, with flowers and local art to add to the fine fittings and decor. The staff was always top-notch, very helpful and attentive.Our room was very well appointed, clean and crisp with attention to detail. The bed was very comfortable, and there was plenty of space at the desk and easy chair with lots of space to move around. We paid a small premium for an ocean-view room and did not regret it: the room was quiet and the view could not be beat. We were on the 8th floor and recommend a high floor room if one is available.Unlike many big chain hotels these days, Hotel Renew offers free wifi done right (with a wired connection available on the desk if you prefer). Each room has its own wireless router and all you do is connect to your room's signal; it was strong and free and did not require passwords or daily signing in. You don't pay for electricity or water at a hotel, nor do you have to validate yourself to use these utilities; we believe wifi service should be treated the same way, and we commend Hotel Renew for this practice. We appreciated the small fridge in the room (NOT a minibar!) good for storing water or leftovers. Breakfast is ample and fresh, served in the seating area which becomes the bar in the evenings, surrounded by fun art and attractive fixtures. There were only a few minor drawbacks to our experience. The room lighting controls were a little tricky to operate, and even with all the lights on it was occasionally a bit dim. The room could have used a bit more light. It took us a long time to find the second light in the bathroom (""Touch here""); we'd wondered how to get light in the shower and would recommend that the bellman demonstrate that while he's going through the room controls. Also, there were no coffee making facilities in the room, although there was coffee and lemon iced water available in the lobby for most of the day (and the convenient Starbucks around the corner opens at 5 a.m.)Our review would not be complete without a big shout-out to Jacqueline the weeknight bartender. She was personable and fun, and made absolutely killer mai tais which were heavy on the fresh lime juice, unique, tasty, and satisfying.We had a marvelous stay at Hotel Renew and have already been recommending it to friends and family. With 3-night stay offers, it is completely unbeatable; we'll definitely be back.","Henderson, Nevada","moot54</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Henderson, Nevada</strong>",70,5.0

I loved the look and comfort of the room. Staff is very friendly and helpful. I had many questions (typical tourist) and they graciously answered them all. My room had air conditioning and thick screens to block out the sun during the day. These are must haves for a Seattle native who is used to 40 degree pouring rain and thick cloud cover. We melt in anything over 75 degrees. Hotel is very well maintained. The two drawbacks which were only a minor inconvenience are no business center and no room service. My flight was delayed by two hours, so I didn't get into Honolulu until 10:30pm. I was too tired to go searching for food. It would have been nice to order room service. I learned the next day there are plenty of restaurants and snack bars within walking distance. I asked for the business center so I could print out vouchers I needed for two (tremendous waste of time) attractions I had booked during my trip. The receptionist informed me they didn't have one, but I could email what I needed printed, and they would do it for me. That was very nice of them. I'm unsure what the regular room rate is for this hotel. I booked my trip through Priceline and got round trip airfare plus 5 nights at Hotel Renew for $1500 and some change. I'm pretty sure their regular rates must be reasonable because of the bargain I go. If I ever visit Waikiki again, I'd likely stay at Hotel Renew.

I couldn't agree more!The moment you check in, you are blown away by the exceptional service you receive from the staff. I was treated to a cold drink upon check-in, and a wet cloth to freshen up, and the bellhop immediately took my bags up to my room, all the while I was still checking in. Not even some of the other top resorts I've stayed in (that are far more expensive) had such a service. When arriving in my room, the aforementioned bellhop announced his name, left his card, and told me I could contact him any time if I needed anything. Such great service.The room was gorgeous. Everything was very modern and looked very luxurious and fancy. All lights in the room were controlled by a small panel where you had different options - all the way off, dim, etc. Fancy. Everything looked brand new with no visible wear or tear. The bathroom was outstanding. In addition, the room had all the amenities you could ask for, including a fridge for your personal use, free wi-fi, flatscreen with lots of channels, and much more. I had a deluxe room with an ocean view. Now, while I could certainly see the ocean, The Renew is not an ocean front hotel. It's important to keep in mind that the hotel is physically located a bit away from the beach and the ocean, and thus can't boast ocean views as impressive as the hotels closer to the beach or Kalakaua Ave. The view was also complicated by the fact that they are doing massive construction on Waikiki Beach at the moment, and the hotel is unfortunately facing the portion of the beach that is closed off due to construction.So, you can see the ocean, but not really 'feel' it so to speak. The photo I've attached shows the view after a considerable zoom on my camera.The hotel is just a short walk from the beach, though, and all the shops and restaurants in the area. You actually land in the 'beginning' of where all the action begins. The zoo is also just a 5 minute walk from the front desk. Aside from the so-so ocean view, the hotel is outstanding - especially considering the relatively low price. The location is also convenient for any activities you may have in Waikiki Beach.I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are on a budget!","Copenhagen, Denmark","NirvClub</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Copenhagen, Denmark</strong>",219,4.0

They stored our luggage until the room was available, and phoned us when the room was ready.

Would not have known about this affordable gem except for Trip Advisor, so thanks to all the previous reviewers. Right across the street from the Mariott Waikiki, the location is great. Half a block to the beach. Bus stops right on the corner to take you to diamond head (one direction) or to the rest of Waikiki (other direction). I rented a car one day and used the Hertz counter at the Marriott. Hotel is new throughout. Room was clean and promptly serviced. It rained pretty hard one day of my stay and I was pleased to return to my room at 9am to find it had already been made up so I could hang out there until the storm let up. The bed is very comfortable. Street noise is an issue - I live in NYC, so I'm used to loud street noise, but the windows could use more soundproofing. I don't know the history of the hotel, but the bathroom window and sliding glass door to the balcony in my room (501) looked like they were left over from before the hotel was renovated. That's where the noise problem was worst. There should be some more soundproofing, but my rate was great and the city does quiet down fairly early (unlike NYC), so it wasn't something that made me crazy. Free breakfast was great. Yogurt, fruit, toast, pastries, cereal, pineapple juice and teas. Great Kona coffee too. Breakfast room is small, but I never had a problem getting a table. People are respectful and try to hustle along if they see there are people looking for a seat. I was able to read the complimentary newspaper and have a leisurely breakfast every day. The staff members working the breakfast worked very hard to keep the food replenished and make sure the seating area was clean.All staff members are extremely courteous, helpful and knowledgeable. The hotel offers free use of beach chairs, boogie boards, beach towels and mats. This was so great. It was nice to have a chair to sit on at the beach.If you have a late flight home, the hotel offers a room to shower and change so you can go to the beach all day and shower before your flight. You can reserve it the night before your departure and they will give you an hour time slot to use the room. I asked about it because I had read about this service on Tripadvisor. They did not offer it (but perhaps would have when I checked out). It was nice to have privacy to get ready. I stayed at the Marriott Waikiki a few years ago and the shower room was a suite where many people were hanging out and people took turns in the bathroom. Gross.Hotel focuses on minimizing power use, which I appreciate - but the lighting in the rooms is on the dim side. Would be nice if one bright bulb was available at bedside for reading, but I was at the beach most of the time and exhausted at night, so it wasn't a real bother. Waikiki is a strange place. Some great hotels and some really scary places, so do your homework before you go. A great rate may mean a stale old hotel nowhere near the places you want to go. My trip was great and I'd definitely check in with the Hotel Renew the next time I'm in Honolulu.I used Roberts Hawaii for my transfers to and from the airport. Reserved in advance online for $20 roundtrip for a shared van. I recommend them to get to/from Hotel Renew.","New York City, New York","mer220</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",25,4.0

I stayed here with my sister in law for three nights in February 2012.The hotel is a short stroll to the beach (2 minutes at most) and a slightly longer stroll to the majority of stores (5 minutes).The staff was friendly and helpful, including the housekeeping staff.The continental breakfast is simple and includes cereal, toast, croissants, fresh fruit, yoghurt, pineapple juice, percolator coffee and also tea. The breakfast area is very small though and some people chose to eat in their rooms.The rooms are modern, clean and comfortable and the mattress is of medium firmness. There were two soft and two firmer pillows provided. The room wew had, 404, was not what I would call spacious but it is big enough for a couple.The valet parking costs $25 per day. The rooms contain the standard safes which require you to choose your own code. There was an ironing board, iron and lots of hanging space.My only complaint is that when I booked with hotels.com, my confirmation print out said that all taxes were included in the $172 p.n. charge. However at checkout they added tax and would not budge from this position (the lady was far from nice about it as well!)But all in all I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.

This is by no means a resort hotel, but they more than make up for it with exceptional customer service (this means you, Daniel, Adam, Anna, Grace and Tina!!) and added complimentary services that really set them apart from other hotels. The hotel is very clean and nicely decorated, and not in kitschy Hawaiian like some hotels. They provide free wi-fi, complimentary beach towels, beach mats, beach chairs and boogey boards, and a courtesy room for one hour the day you are leaving if you have a late flight so that you can freshen up. The continental breakfast is very well done considering how little space there is in the lobby - cereals, pastries, fruit, yogurt, juice and coffee. The bar does not skimp on the drinks and the atmosphere is very pleasant and relaxing. Our housekeeper, Tina, went out of her way to make us feel welcome every morning and took excellent care of us and the room. We were so impressed with the service - every single staff member was friendly without being fake and seemed to genuinely like their jobs. I had reviewed Tripadvisor prior to booking this hotel and can say that those reviews, for the most part, were absolutely spot on. The reviews that mentioned the elevators being slow were correct but come on! You are on vacation - what is your hurry? As for the noise from the street, you are in a major city amid other hotels, restaurants and clubs. Of course there is going to be noise! But we were amazed at how quiet the room really was. You could hear the music from Tiki's and yes, occasionally there was siren noise, but the air conditioner humming blocked out the worst of it. The room (we had a king bed) had plenty of room, plenty of storage space for belongings, a very nice flatscreen w/HDTV, and eco-friendly lighting conveniently located.

It's hard to find fault with a place in such a great location--just a block off Waikiki Beach at the quieter end near the zoo--with reasonable rates, such friendly and helpful staff and very comfortable, stylish accommodations... BUT take a look at my posted photos of the view: tennis shoes tossed over a power line immediately in front of our window and a dumpster-diver and ""peepers"" at the hostel across the street. We got an Expedia rate and I wonder if discounters get the worst views... ours on the 2nd floor had to be the worst. This was Valentine's Day AND our birthdays, so a view without decorated power lines, an overflowing dumspter and derelicts spying into our room would have added better ambiance!Now that I got that out of the way, our room was otherwise ideal, with a very comfortable king-size bed, soothing decor, flat-screen TV and a very nice bathroom. And when our free wifi wouldn't initially connect, a technician was dispatched quickly to fix the router problem. The concierge was friendly and attentive, and the desk staff had good advice when all major restaurants were fully booked for Valentine's Day. They also provide towels, chairs and mats to take to the nearby beach.The cozy breakfast area in the lobby was always packed in the morning, but there is a Starbucks and other options around the corner. Be aware that the Lemon Road side of the building is a continuous block of hostels--some better than others. Some seem to accommodate well-behaved backpacking students, but the one in front of us was populated by older boarders who seemed down-on-their-luck and prone to loud rants and hanging out on the stairs with the seeming intent of spying into the hotel across the street.

It's a cozy and small boutique hotel a block down from Waikiki Beach, behind the Aston. We were welcomed immediately by Adam, who wound up assisting us with everything from connecting our room's WiFi, getting our rental Jeep in the garage, to trying to fix the soft-top on aforementioned Jeep. It is quiet inside the hotel and in the hallways. We had room 802 which was facing the back of the hotel looking out to other hotels, which was fine for us. Again, it was super quiet in the room as well, which was great when we were just relaxing and getting some shut eye. We are from NYC, so all this quiet I am mentioned was welcomed with open arms.I'd recommend the hotel to couples and business travelers. You can definitely get your rest and even some work done if you needed to. As the name suggests, you do get that ""renewed"" feeling upon waking and heading out for some fun in Oahu.Some things that might be a concern to others: no fitness center, no business center, dining area is just a few tables next to the lobby (where you can have a light free breakfast each morning: toast, muffins, fruit, cereal, coffee, juice), and valet parking is $25/day.I would stay here again when we are in the Waikiki/Honolulu area. It's a great relief from some of the madness of the larger name-brand hotels.","New York City, New York","Kay C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",7,4.0

It is a small hotel, well decorated, and the welcome/reception staff are all very friendly. There are no line-ups that you will need to worry about (unlike almost all of the big hotels along the strip). This hotel has no pool area, but this suited us well as we walked to the beach (30 seconds' walk) and went swimming. Why would you fly to Honolulu for a hotel pool? Rent a car, drive to the North Shore, and go to an amazing remote beach that you can only find in Hawaii (as we did). I do not think there is any room service, either, but it is not like you are located in a remote area. Generally, I think this hotel is best for independent-minded tourists who want excellent value and want to get the most out of Hawaii. The hotel is on the far end of the Honolulu strip, but if you any of the restaurants/hotels/shops along the strip, everything is within walking distance in any event. Also it is beside one of the numerous ""ABC Stores"" which seem to sell everything that you will need if you forget anything / need a late night snack. I would also note that breakfast is included (which we appreciate), especially if you want to ""get up and go"". There seemed to be limited seating in the breakfast area (which is really an extension of the lobby), however we never had any problem with seating (unlike some others who have noted this) - and we were there at various times throughout our 7 days. So my general advice as someone who stays in a wide variety of hotels is that this hotel is probably the best value in Honolulu; I don't think there is any reason to stay at any of the other big hotels in Honolulu over this hotel. If you want a Hawaii-style resort, go to one of the more remote areas where you can experience this (or to another island - see my other hotel reviews!).","London, United Kingdom","JakobLHR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",53,5.0

We select this hotel because of the price and location, not many hotels on Waikiki that close to the beach front that can offer the price lower than 300USD. Room - clean and tidy, full amenities, hair dryer. There is no sunlight on the balcony for whole day, however, you can enjoy the beach within 3minutes walk. The downside for the room are it is very (i mean very) close to the lift and it is the corner of 2 garbage dump areas - Garbage area for Marriott Waikiki and Garbage collection on the Lemon road. The garbage collection start at the non-peak hours of Waikiki, which is few hours before midnight and an hour before dawn (6AM). If you are light sleeper, you may prefer the beachfront, where Aston have the live music on till midnight but nothing before dawn to wake you up. Staffs are very attentive and nice. Though the hotel staffs cannot give much of area information more than 'it is tourist areas so you can walk around'. Check-in and out is effective and fast.Facilities - We do not have time for the breakfast so I cannot comment on that. Hotel have free wi-fi for all the rooms. However, the car-park charges at USD25/night (after tax). Location - is excellent. It locates almost the end of Waikiki beach before Honolulu Zoo.

Of course the city side does allow you full exposure to the 6:28 AM garbage truck arrival which is a Waikiki tradition. It is overall a minimalist experience. If you expect little you will be satisfied. On the plus the smallish room was comfortable and the electrical options were interesting. All reviews re the staff are a mystery.

We were certainly not disappointed, and were most impressed with the excellent attitude and service provided by all staff. The room decor was fresh and modern, the continental breakfast included was modest but sufficient, and the valet parking ($25.00/day) was about the quickest response we have experienced. Free loan of beach chairs, towels and boogie boards is a nice touch, and the local knowledge and directions were impressive and a great help. Happy hour in the small lobby bar is good value, and free wi-fi in the rooms is a better deal than most hotels offer. Not being very pool-y or fitness centre-y people, we didn't find the lack of these facilities any disadvantage at all.Given the location (a small building squeezed in between much larger hotels) there is not really much of a broad ocean view to be had, even in the 'Premium Ocean View' rooms, but a 150 metre walk will give you the real thing anyway. Opening windows in the room were welcome, and although locked to allow only a small opening, staff offered to shift the lock position if required. This may be necessary for some, as we found the air conditioner to be unreasonably loud - the only thing we could possibly criticise in an otherwise very relaxing stay in this clean and friendly hotel.A 15 minute walk to the Rainbow Drive-In offers a taste of the old Hawaii in a 1950's-style diner, offering very basic and very cheap menu items, some of which you would probably not find elsewhere - even in Hawaii. (anyone for spaghetti with a hot dog on top?). There's an ABC store just outside the front door of the hotel, and a 10 minute walk along Kalakaua or Kuhio will find any type of dining you need. Acces to the freeway is quick and easy, and return to the airport is less than a 20-minute drive.No hesitation in recommending Hotel Renew as a pleasant departure from the larger chain hotels. It's a bit more expensive than the typical Outrigger or Ohana (which we also enjoy) but you do get what you pay for.","Melbourne, Australia","robtup</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",17,5.0

The complimentary Continental Breakfast is good with Fresh pineapple and other fresh fruits as well as cereal, muffins, croissants, yogurt and toast-also pineapple juice. Not a lot of amenities, but that is not what I was looking for since I did not come to Hawaii to swim in a pool or use a fitness room-I came to swim at the beach and hike!

The only minor complaint I have is the bathroom. It was quite small and the shower/tub/glass doors seem to be a little bit outdated. Some minor touch-ups would fix it though. no major problems. There's not facility at Hotel Renew. No fitness center, no pool. But who needs a pool when the beach is just a minute away? The hotel provides complimentary beach towel and chairs.

The hotel is pretty much at the end of the Waikiki area, but you can easily walk to the other side of Waikiki in 15 minutes (if you don't stop at any stores). The hotel is much cheaper than hotels RIGHT at Waikiki, so if you don't mind a little walk everyday, this is a great choice.

And the rate I paid was very reasonable.I had initially made reservations at one of the huge hotels down the street, but I ended up switching to Hotel Renew a few weeks before arrival and I'm so glad I did. It's a medium-sized hotel with wonderful staff. I had a rental car, so I used the valet every day, multiple times. Each time they were nice and friendly, and prompt.As others have mentioned, the hotel is only a block from the beach and from the shops along Kalakaua Ave. You can easily walk to many restaurants, shops, and dozens (seemingly hundreds) of ABC Stores from the hotel.I loved the style of my room, and it was spotless. Definitely a boutique hotel vibe, which I love, but it won't be for everybody. No floral bedspreads or curtains, if that's what you're looking for. The bed was super comfortable. Oh, and I had a slight issue with my TV when I first got to my room, but maintenance came immediately after I called, and they fixed the problem.

Trip Advisor has always been my go-to site for choosing hotels and the positive reviews on Hotel Renew are spot on! I just got back from a week stay at this hotel on Monday. It is one short block away from the picturesque Waikiki beach and the vacation was out of this world. Waikiki is one of the most beautiful places I've ever been to and the staff at Hotel Renew made it an unforgettable trip for my Grandma and I. From the moment that you arrive at the doorstep of the hotel there was a concierge waiting to bring in our luggage; inside we were greeted by Grace with ice cold pineapple juice and a warm towel to freshen up. It was a wonderful welcome! Throughout the week Adam, Daniel and Mike in particular were fantastic and very responsive in providing advice on things to do during our visit. We were always warmly welcomed back upon our returns from our excursions so it had a very friendly atmosphere in an industry where you don't see that everyday. The staff would proactively take care of things that we would need like porter service for our luggage upon departure and getting transfer service organized for us to the airport. Further there was a room that you could book for an hour if you had a later flight so that you could freshen up before your departure. It was a nice added touch given that checkout time was at noon.When coming back to O'ahu I would stay here again with no hesitation. Very clean, nice decor and out of this world service. The only 2 suggestions that I would have would be about: the continental breakfast and the bedding. A bit more variety in the breakfast menu would be warmly appreciated by your guests especially when staying for more than a couple days. The duvets on the beds were a bit too warm for the climate as well, so the AC needed to be on to have a comfortable sleep. Quite minor things but Hotel Renew requested candid feedback. Many happy returns and appreciation for a wonderful holiday; we'll be back! :)","Calgary, Canada","beachnski</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",1,5.0

It's pretty steep, but from what I understand it's that way at all of the hotels in Waikiki. Adam and the rest of the staff were so nice that we couldn't be too annoyed about paying that.

No issues with booking, a nice considerate email just prior to the ""no refund"" detail was appreciated. After a long day and longer flight we were warmly greeted at HR reception. I cringed with the thought of Gaugain-style images in the room, but the hotel stayed to a clean boutique-meets-Asia flair. We liked the proximity to the beach, convenience store, morning cuppa Joe around the corner (at 0530hrs) and ease with picking up a tour to Pearl Harbor. Breakfast was terrific (though go early due to limited seating and early risers...with appetites). Bed was comfy and I liked (oddly) the bathroom mirror lighting.I agree the hotel is not entirely sound proof. One very young and really unhappy traveller on our floor howled between 0200hrs and 0240hrs one night and 1040-G*d knows when the next night. If children at a boutique hotel is not your thing (we found it odd frankly, as we found a boutique hotel is not a usual family haunt), perhaps ask during check-in if you are on an adult floor.For me, the air conditioner in #802 was very loud and competed with our young guest in the loudness category.

Because we were unable to order a breakfast (even fruit) in advance, maybe book a later tour if you can.","Calgary, Canada","Notam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",130,4.0

I turned to grab my bags, but they had already been whisked away to the elevator. The rooms are modern in decor, comfortable with a cool edge. Very clean and quiet. I had read a lot of complaints about the air conditioning, and although it did hum a bit, I found it good for drowning out the garbage trucks in the morning. Nice bathroom, glass shower with rainshower head. The room was a peaceful oasis from the crowds and we always looked forward to getting back to relax in the late afternoon. Breakfast was great. Good coffee, fresh fruit and a good variety of pastries always got us through until lunch. The location of the hotel is ideal. Love that end of Waikiki.

I booked a flight/car/hotel through Orbitz. For reasons unbeknownst to me, Orbitz decided to book my hotel the week before, while booking the flight and car the proper dates. Unfortunately, I didn't catch this in time - the hotel reservation had already started. So I called up the hotel, where the manager told me that there was nothing she could do, but to contact Orbitz. I called up Orbitz, who then called them, and told me that when they spoke to them, the hotel wasn't going to budge - they were going to charge me for the full room rate. No offers to discount my stay for the upcoming week - just a straightforward ""you're fresh out of luck."" Of course, when I called, they had the audacity to ask me if I wanted to book the room for this upcoming weekend. Really? Granted, the problem is somewhere else (me, possibly - Orbitz, sure). But in an age where exceptional customer service is becoming the norm, why wouldn't the hotel make an effort to understand that a visitor is coming to the islands - somehow the reservation got screwed up - and that they should do something *hospitable* within their power to alleviate my problem?The staff there need to learn better phone manners to make this a better experience when things inevitably go wrong - at least pretend to care, please.","Los Angeles, California","RoyK327</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",25,1.0

The staff was amazing, friendly and they wanted to make sure we received the best customer service possible. When I first arrived at the hotel, Adam was extremely helpful and accommodating. I've never stayed at a hotel that provided this type of service. He asked to take our luggage and brought it up to our room without hesitation. When we arrived at the front counter, they welcomed us and provided us with amazing pineapple juice and cold face towels. The room was excellent! It was very modern and gave a Zen type of feeling. There was a dresser to put your clothes in which are not common at other hotels. They also provided a safe for your valuables. Their complimentary breakfast was great! They offered croissants, muffins, toast, cereal, soymilk, regular milk, and pineapple juice with extra condiments. I'm used to staying at a 4 - 5 star hotel and was a bit skeptical staying at Hotel Renew since they were a 3 star hotel. I'm glad that I decided to stay at Hotel Renew as they have exceeded all of my expectations. I’ve previously stayed at Sheraton Waikiki in 2009 and never received the same type of service. This hotel is a block away from the beach, which was perfect. I didn't want to be right on the beach. The location was great. The valet parking is an additional $25 per night but it was worth it since there is no parking available and didn't want to wait to look for one. The night before we left, Adam suggested that if we needed to freshen up before our flight, there was a courtesy room that we can use for an hour at no additional cost after check out. Guests were welcomed to take a shower and freshen up. That was a great bonus! Daniel was also accommodating during our stay and gave us the available time for the courtesy room. Altogether, the staff was amazing! They really wanted to make sure that we had a wonderful experience staying at Hotel Renew. We couldn’t have been happier. The only regret I have is not booking earlier. I wanted an Ocean View Room but they were all booked up. I will make sure to book in advance the next time we go to Hawaii!

We found out that we were supposed to drive right in front of the door where a booth was situated (which we didn't see)...our bad.

After reading quite a few reviews on TripAdvisor, we chose the Hotel Renew. We were not disappointed. We received great service from the front desk (the male staff smiled much more than the female employees -- but everyone was very professional).PROS:+ Rooms well appointed, with contempory decor+ A few steps to the beach+ Continental breakfast included, which is excellent for those early sightseeing morning+ Complimentary beach chairs (which however are very low to the ground and consequently difficult for seniors to use -- but still handy and cheaper that paying $50/day to rent two chairs and an umbrella on the beach!)+ Attentive staff that made efforts to make your sightseeing easier (whether by printing maps or providing candid assessments of the various tours -- they saved us money by giving us tips on how to maximize our trip to Pearl Harbour without paying for the expensive group tours)CONS- No balconies. Yes, the hotel is a few steps away from the beach, but being able to sit on your balcony in the morning and watch the city wake up would be nice. Something to consider if you have people in your group who are early risers- Air conditioning in our room was difficult to control; consequently, we either were warm under the fantastic duvet or cold since the air was going full blast. It was challenging to find the happy medium. - Valet parking is expensive ($25) compared to the self-parking lot ($10) that is a block away. However, the hotel employees never once made an issue of the fact we were using the parkage instead of their valet service and would still help us unload the car after a day of sightseeing.The ""Cons"" however are pretty much negated by the ""Pros"". We enjoyed the hotel. But more importantly, we enjoyed just how helpful the staff members at the hotel were. This was an ideal choice for a young couple (my partners and myself) who appreciates a more contemporary hotel and for our parents (i.e. senior citizens) who value personal attentive service.","Vancouver, Canada","acadian27</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",3,4.0

It was ok for a night or two but the rooms are rather small. We had two double beds, one for our son and there was not much room for anything else. The tv is large if you like to watch tv in bed. The bathroom was pretty average really for boutique, tub was so small and shallow. The air con was right near the bed and the room smelt musty. We just had a view of another building and a palm tree as we were level two. Also there was no fridge in the room, it looked like one but apparently it was just to store drinks in without chilling them. Breakfast was interesting. We called to ask where it was as there was no rooms for it? It was basically in the foyer, there was a very small area with a few tables to accomodate nine levels of guests so of course not everyone could get a table which was very awkward.

Most welcomed after the flight and taxi ride (which took about 30 minutes and wasn't overly expensive - although I can't remember how much it cost - sorry). We had booked a Premier Ocean View room (which turned out to a a corner room, so we overlooked the sea and from the room balcony, also had views of the rear of the hotel and a neighbouring hotel car park). The room was of a reasonable size and comfortable for two people. Everything worked - lights, hairdryer, small fridge, wifi, tv. The bed was very large - almost California size at a guess, and fairly soft. Being used to sleeping on a memory foam bed, I was concerned about how well I'd sleep, but had no problems at all. The room air conditioning wasn't particularly quiet, but didn't interefere with sleeping. Plenty of fresh towels were provided daily and the room was kept clean and tidy by the maid. Blinds at the patio door and across the room windows were excellent at cutting out the light - almost to blackout standard. One complaint - small, but as everything else was so good, it became a bit of a bugbear to me - there was no blind across the bathroom window. There is no danger of anyone 'peeping' as the glass is frosted, but as the rest of the room was so dark because of the blinds, when the sun came up in the morning the room became illuminated from the light shining through the bathroom window. A blind would have solved this and allowed for a few more minutes sleep each morning. Other reviewers have commented on the breakfast arrangements, and there isn't a great deal more about that to be said. It was plentiful with a good selection of fruits and cereals. Unfortunately some of the guests could have done with some courtesy lessons. There are a limited number of tables and chairs available at breakfast time and some guests, once finished breakfast, sat at the tables and read the complimentary newspapers, even though others were standing around waiting to be seated. Be warned, it can be a frustrating start to the day!! Located only a couple of hundred yards away from the beach and sea and a few minutes stroll to the main area of Waikiki the Renew is a good hotel. Whilst unlikely to visit Oahu again, if I did, then I'd have no hesitation in returning. For the money (and the hotel's website does appear to offer the best deals) it would be very hard to beat.","Cambridgeshire, England","fens_england</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridgeshire, England</strong>",8,4.0

The bed itself is also superb, up there with some of the best 5 * hotels I've stayed at. There is in room WIFI that is actually fast for once thanks to EVERY room having its own wireless router under the TV rather than shared between many rooms. For the money, these rooms are excellent value. The location is great only 5-10m away from the street of Waikiki beach. You don't get any view from the hotel but for the price can't complain.The two things that could be improved is the range and area for breakfast. There is a very limited selection of food and the area is small and often full. Still, for the money, just getting breakfast is great! The other thing is, like others have mentioned, the noisy AC in the rooms which mar the otherwise excellent room.

The Hotel is not very big, holds i think around 60-80 rooms with 9 floors?,. i could be wrong but regardless this is a good thing, the staff will know you well and will be more than happy to help. When we checked in to our room, they had a chilled bottle of champagne, glasses and a handwritten note which we thought was brilliant for them to do for us.The breakfast is the cererals, croissants, fruit, hot drinks..the breakfast lounge is small and not always easy to get a seat but we often took the brekkie back to our room. We had a balcony, maybe not with the best view but did have lovely great weather and see the volcanos/hills in the distance.The location is 15 mins from the airport. 30 second walk to the beach, you are literally on the beach walk, great bars and restaurants and fancy shops and Diamond Head all there.I am sure other hotels are also good my i know for sure when we go back to hawaii, me and my wife would stay only at the Renew..","London, United Kingdom","PSJ0</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",47,5.0

We were really unsure of what to expect, so we headed to tripadvisor to get a recommendation.We chose Hotel Renew based on the reviews, the value, and the proximity to Waikiki Beach. All things considered, this is an amazing hotel. The beach is one block down, and if you have been to Waikiki before, you know that everything is accessible by walking. Unfortunately, with all of our wedding plans (Hotel Renew had nothing to do with our wedding arrangements - we were married at Haiku Gardens in Kaneohe), we chose to rent a car.Valet Parking costs $20 per day and you may come and go as many times as you want within that day, but if you park, you pay. This is not uncommon in Waikiki. You will undoubtedly always be paying per night to park if you have a car, so please keep this in mind. Valet is the only option at Hotel Renew, but with general parking at other hotels costing around the same price, this is actually not a bad option if you must have a vehicle for your trip.Check in:We were somewhat disappointed that they were not able to give us any kind of upgrade as we were there for our wedding. However, they were definitely not under the obligation of doing so. We got the room we paid for, and it was a very nice room. I only mention this, because people often think that upgrades happen for special occasions, but it didn't happen for us. HOWEVER, they did send us up a bottle of champagne on our wedding day, along with a card and also one for my mom who celebrated her birthday in the same week. Very thoughtful!**One thing I will also say, because I was caught a bit off guard by this, is the deposit upon check in. I have never experienced this before, and perhaps that is naive, but this happened to us at both hotels we stayed at in Hawaii. Hotel Renew placed a $200 hold on our card at check in and the other hotel held $500. Please be aware of this when budgeting! The charge is reversed at check out, but can take a couple of days to return the funds to your account.The staff at this hotel is wonderful. Every person I encountered was friendly and helpful. I am so glad we chose this hotel. It may not be a resort, but this place has a quiet kind of luxury that you cannot experience in a big resort hotel.

The staff are wonderful, gracious and attentive, continental breakfast was just right, the bed was luxurious, and the location was perfect. We did not have an ocean view room which was fine with me because I went outside, and up the street 1/2 block and there was the beautiful Pacific Ocean! Initially, I was worried that the hotel lacked a pool and a gym. I am so glad I got over that! I ran and/or biked EVERY day. There's a GREAT rental place right beside the hotel where you can get bicycles or scooters. If there was a gym at the hotel, I would have missed these amazing opportunities to see the island up close. The bottom line is that the caliber of service and intimacy experienced at this smaller hotel more than made up for missing amenities. Does your ""big hotel"" host a happy hour with appetizers and delicious, refreshing Blue Hawaiis?!We received wonderful recommendations for restaurants while at the hotel. Don't miss Uncle Bo's (thanks Jacqueline!)...awesome food and frequented by locals.
