The carpets are all stained quite badly. We had to ask to change rooms. The second one wasn’t any better. The furnishings are old and dated. There are gaps between the outlets and the wall - unfinished and poorly done. The walls are all marked with luggage skid marks. The bathrooms have mold and a rusted roof access panel. Common areas are ok. But one of the saddest hotels I’ve been to in Tokyo and I’ve been to many. Will never stay here again.,,vikkiw2016,0,1.0

The staff was excellent. Located near a subway stop, there are numerous eating and shopping choices in the area. This is a good central location for exploring Tokyo. Only a few subway stops from both Shibuya and Shinjuku, you could walk to both is inclined (it took me twenty minutes to walk to Shibuya Crossing). About a thirty minute subway ride to sites on eastern side of town (Ueno Park and Asakasa Shrine).",,295garyw,6,5.0

We were not disappointed. We booked two Modern Double Rooms for the five of us. Two adults and two teens and a child. Very spacious. Excellent shower design. We loved it. Nice amenities. Comfortable bed and quiet location. 1 minute walk to the Gaiemae Subway station. It's on the GInza Line and was very convenient. It's a Japanese boutique hotel. We didnt require breakfast, or any facilities in the hotel. We simple needed the room and shower. Concierge Dean Andrew was helpful with restaurant reservations. Taxis didn't know the hotel. Show them the map that comes with the hotel key, and no problems getting to the hotel. Complimentary bottles of water given each day. Housekeeping very attentive. Clean and I like how they observe my preferences. I hate housekeeping that moves everything back to their original spots everyday. Amenities were nice. Level 2 is the main entrance, which is entered from the Stadium street and there is a driveway that you have to turn in and up the ramp to the roundabout of the entrance. Many taxis wouldn't know that entrance. The only complaint I have was , we were on Level 8, and each morning and late at night, I don't know why there are lots of noise thumping, and banging above us. Level 9 is not guest room floor. I am assuming it's from the fitness center and spa that is on level 10. We may return to this hotel in the future if the price is not too expensive.

This hotel is located a short walking distance from Meiji Shrine, Shibuya, and Harajuku. Roppongi is about a 40 minute walk away. The nearest train station is only one minute away and it was easy to get to Tokyo Station (~15 mins). Lots of options for food all around....Aoyama is a high end neighborhood and we easily found delicious breakfast, wagyu beef restaurants, and ramen.

We stayed here for 5 nights recently.Our first room was very large as requested ( even by Tokyo standards ) but it was outdated and bathroom was tired. We then realized that there were more recently renovated rooms available and switched to a slightly smaller but updated room. This made a huge difference and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Room was still spacious and well planned. No views but this did not matter to us.Service was excellent. Staff went out of their way to help us.Breakfast was good but not cheap. We did not choose the breakfast plan since there was no deal and it gave us options to eat elsewhere.Location is great but one has to realize that Tokyo is so huge, there is no single optimal location.This is a very pleasant area of Tokyo and the subway is steps from the hotel. The hotel is quiet and feels more like a serviced residence than a hotel. Overall a wonderful place to stay.

The rooms are very spacious, and the beds are HUUUGE! There was plenty of room for my husband, 3-year-old daughter and I to sleep. We could have easily fit another child on there. The front desk staff were nice and the cleaning staff were lovely too. I accidentally left a necklace behind in my room, and the cleaning staff found it and reception arranged for it to be posted back to me in Australia for a small fee – thank goodness! The location near Gaienmae subway stop was very handy – only 2 stops to Shibuya, and you could walk there in 30 minutes too. About 15 minutes walk to Harajuku. Only downsides were expensive in-house laundry service, no in-room dining options, and the restaurants on site were quite expensive too.

I was introduced to the hotel by a family friend who is the PR manager of the property, and it didn't take much convincing to give it a try during my last trip to Tokyo. The main reason was the location (I lived for 7 years in Aoyama and to me it's the best area to be in in Tokyo hands down).I'm very glad I tried it. I now have my new go-to-place in Tokyo. Excellent hotel and location. You can't beat staying in the heart of Aoyoama, a couple of minutes walking from Omotesando, 10 minutes to Harajuku through the lovely side streets, and in the heart of everything Aoyama has to offer. And the Ginza line stop is literally outside the hotel. It feels like you are living in a cool neighborhood as a local, not staying a big corporate hotel in a business district. The hotel is feels like it's brand new, the rooms are HUGE for Tokyo standards, and the bathrooms are palatial and really nicely designed. Very well designed and comfortable. The rooms are simple, modern and nothing fancy. Just right. I also loved how quiet the hotel is. It's also not very big so i feels personal. The staff were extremely nice, helpful and most importantly out of your way. It felt like coming ""home"" every night. The gym is also excellent - as a guest you can access a club that is on the top 2 floors of the building with pools, golf range, classes and every type of machine you could ever imagine. I didn't try the restaurant on premise, as in Tokyo there a endless other options, but it looked very inviting.I'll be definitely going back here next time I go back to Tokyo.","New York City, New York","FedericoE545</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",9,5.0

The beds are huge, rooms itself is huge, bathroom is amazing! The location of the hotel is great, it’s not far from Shibuya crossing and Shibuya shopping, walking distance away. Water gets filled daily; rooms get cleaned quickly. Staff is very polite. Breakfast is an absolute disaster though, we had it in one morning and we didn’t go again, they do not have a buffet for the breakfast, it is a set Ala carte menu and offers two options, Japanese breakfast or American breakfast, we took the American one, and it tasted horrific , there was nothing tasty on it. Please work on your breakfast! You should also offer more assistance with tours and other recommendations for the tourists. I also used the spa, I went for massage. Now I have few tattoos, they gave me a t shirt and shorts, which I wore and the lady came with a tape and covered up my tattoos, as the spa is members club and there are a lot of older members , so if you have full sleeve tattoos or tattoos which cannot be covered up, this is not your place. I liked the massage, unfortunately I did not use the other facilities in the spa :) Nevertheless, it was a great stay!
