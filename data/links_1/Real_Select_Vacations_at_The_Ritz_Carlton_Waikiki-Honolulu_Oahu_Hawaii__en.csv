It was our first time in this location and we had big expectations since we used to stay at the Ritz suites and residences on Maui. We loved the suite, the service, and the convenience of the location. We had so much fun, we didn't even leave Waikiki.Highly recommend!","Honolulu, Hawaii","staran808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",0,5.0
