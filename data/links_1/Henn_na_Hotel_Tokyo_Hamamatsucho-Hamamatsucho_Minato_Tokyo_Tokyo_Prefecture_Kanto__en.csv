It’s almost in the middle lf down town tokyo so it’s equidistance to get from one end of the yamanote to the other. My main gripe about my stay would be about the room. The wall socket on the desk is too close to the desk so i couldnt plug in my international adaptor to use my appliances on the desk. I had to plug it into the socket at the head of the bed which created a tripping hazard. The bed itself is not really a bed but like 3 thin matteress put together to form a bed. As such the gap between the lining makes for awful lumbar support and i literally woke up everyday with a backache in my back. It got pretty bad by day 12. This and the socket matter is what would have gotten them 5 points.,,shawndanker,0,4.0

They had an airy feel and we could still spend some time in the room to relax.

The bed was super comfortable, the wifi was great and the TV was absolutely massive and came with chromecast so no need to attempt to decipher Japanese TV shows, you can just watch whatever you want from your phone OR from the complimentary phone that is given to you with the room. It was super handy as a back-up to carry with us during the day and you get free calls in Japan and surrounding countries. The room also came with a free-standing steaming machine by LG, which, admittedly, wasn't really useful for us casual tourists but would come in handy on a business trip. It's in a very convenient location 5 minutes away from Hamamatsucho station that's on the JR Yamanote line (perfect for Rail Pass holders). Plus, you are close to a Lawson and 7-Eleven as well as a Denny's restaurant that is open late in case you return from your travels late. Although a lady had to come out and check us in because the robots didn't manage to (probably because we weren't Japanese nationals and needed a proper human to confirm we were in the country), overall the hotel is superb value for money.","London, United Kingdom","Michelle K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",35,5.0

Their shuttle bus to the hotel was every one hour and we needed to wait for 30min till the next shuttle bus so we decided to go by taxi.
