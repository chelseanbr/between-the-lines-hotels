The room was spacious (especially regarding being in Japan) with large windows, again with a fantastic view overlooking Tokyo (even when lying in bed). The bathroom was also spacious with a separate toilet and a separate giant shower and a bathtub. The room was equipped with a Nespresso machine and snacks, cookies and chocolate. Pajamas are also included. And of course, being in Japan, the TV is a smart-TV with a soundbar. There is an ironing board and minibar as well.On the ground floor there is staff awaiting to serve you with the elevator and greeting you welcome. The reception is on the 28th floor. On this floor is also restaurants and a bar. The service throughout the entire hotel is excellent. There is an Italian restaurant, Piacere, which is very good. The menu for the gentleman/host includes all the prices, while the menu for the lady does not. A little bit posh, but very pleasant. Great food and service. Breakfast is also served here.The lobby lounge was also very nice. The service was, again, excellent.There was a gentleman that worked there that really made our stay extra pleasant. However, we do not recall his name, but we do know that he was from Indonesia and think he was a manager. Again, thank you for your exceptional super and pleasant service!On the 37th floor is the club lounge, where breakfast and evening drinks including snacks is served. For evening drinks, real champagne is served, which is always appreciated. The hotel is in the corner of Tokyo Station Mall, so it is close to the metro and other trains.If you arrive with train from the airport, it is possible to arrange for someone to meet you at the train and escort you to the hotel. It is called “meet and greet” and is complementary. We recommend you take this opportunity as it can be difficult to find your way upon arrival. There are lots of restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.This is by far, one of the best hotels that we have stayed in.","Stockholm, Sweden","Mango60</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",46,5.0

From the meet and greet at the train station platform through to saying goodbye as we left to fly home all the staff were wonderful and made every second of our stay feel special.It starts on the 28th floor of a shared office building, although it has its own ground floor entrance, so the views from all of its rooms are stunning. I am generally a terrible sleeper, more so in hotels, but I've never had such a good couple of nights sleep as I did here. Most comfortable bed I can ever recall using.It only has two restaurants, a Japanese one and an Italian; the Italian was only serving a special degustation menu whilst we were there which with it being the end of our holiday we couldn't face so didn't try. We did have breakfast which, as expected, was of an extremely high quality and one of the best I've ever had.All in all its a fantastic place, so good that it's become a destination in its own right for me...the only other hotel I can think of that makes me feel this way is The Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok.

Upon checking in I asked where I could eat lunch, was told no, early check in with AMEX no, tea in the afternoon - no. The good:-Located next tokyo station- from my room window I can see the Mandarin Oriental down the street where I had a great stay. The bad-bad attitude of staff who are mostly foreign to japan but without training -hallways that smell like moth balls -outdated hotel-furniture from your grandparents vacation homeBy the way, asked to speak to the general manager twice - never heard from him.

You can see (nightly?) fireworks from Disney, and they even provided a set of mini binocs for the kiddo. Breakfast is stellar, and Piacere is so good for dinner, that whole setup has been a big draw for us (shout out to Naoya!).Wrapping it up, I booked another hotel to add some variety to this trip, regret it already, and haven’t even checked out of shangri-la yet.

I actually was surprised the food offerings were not more extensive, though, like many of the club floors of other hotels we have stayed in. The room was large and lovely with a great view of the Tokyo Tower. I will say, what was wanting is what is also wanting in many Japanese hotel rooms: a huge bathroom but with only one sink, and a shower and bathtub in the same space, so one gets water in the bathtub when showering. And the other item wanting is what is found in many hotel rooms, sadly, now: dramatic mood lighting with small spot lights that do not give enough lighting in many areas of the room, and often those areas where one keeps one's suitcase. I'm tempted to bring along a halogen headlamp in the future.

Best hotel we’ve ever stayed at in the world, with the best staff ever. The welcome party that greeted us instantly made us feel at home. Every time we left and entered the hotel, the perfection was unmatched, from the specific perfume scent once you walk through the doors, to the personalized music created just for the Shangri-La. The breakfast buffet is the best breakfast we have had anywhere, compared to other luxury Hilton and Four Season hotels. We don’t know if we will ever be able to find another hotel that will compare to the standards and services received at the Shangri-La. Even when we had dinner at Nadamah Sushi, the gentleman who waited on us (he was there every night) was extremely kind, helpful, and courteous to walk us through our meal. Overall, words are not enough to describe our experience at the Shangri-La. Everyone around the would, without a doubt, should stay here when visiting Japan.

It was what I expect from an Aman hotel (my wife thinks it even exceeded that). The morning breakfast soon became a daily highlight for my wife, three children (ages 8-14) and I who loved the mix of menu and buffet options. But even better was the restaurant staff who greeted us warmly for every meal. In particular, Kohei and Yuki stood out for their service. My wife is still raving about the way the staff catered to our 8yr old at dinner and the mango pancakes for breakfast.

That meet-and-greet offered the first glimpse of the opulence of the hotel. The bell staff took several of our luggage pieces and guided us expertly through the maze that was Tokyo Station. Once we arrived at the 1st floor of the hotel, the other staff there greeted us warmly as well. The female bell staff noticed that one of my sons ran out of water and immediately offered iced cold bottles as replacements. The elevator has a chandelier, and it took us to the lobby floor for check-in. The check-in area was equally grand. The check-in staff spoke excellent English and was friendly. Our luggage went to our rooms (interconnecting/connecting Imperial Garden view King/Twin Rooms) while we processed the check-in. The rooms were large and immaculately clean. The staff frequently reminded us that the weather was hot and muggy outside and offered cool water whenever we went out. I had to use the doctor one day due to illness. The staff recommended the English speaking clinic located at the next building. A staff then guided me to the doctor and spoke with the nurse there about my reported symptoms. What great service! (The doctor visit cost around $130 USD with diagnosis and medicine.) Several staff was aware of my need of a doctor and inquired about my health when they saw me. Again, it showed warmth and that they cared for me enough as a guest to ask. The location at Tokyo Station offered many conveniences to my family and I. The breakfast buffet was great with many choices. However, after we selected the one pre-set main dish, which was excellent, we barely had room for the wonderful pastries, suimai or other items. Of the small samples that we ate from the buffet tables, the food at the buffet tasted great. The hotel offered to buy the Narita Express tickets for us at cost, but we ended up buying them ourselves when we were at the station after shopping. The hotel also offered, and we took up, the service to guide us to the Narita Express platform. Again, that was needed due to the maze of Tokyo Station. The food at the Lobby Lounge tasted excellent! On our last day, my family visited the Lobby Lounge and ate the excellent tasting soba and wonton noodle soup. The cost was very reasonable, and it was relaxing to enjoy a different view of Tokyo (one can see Skytree partially from the Lobby Lounge). The afternoon tea appeared popular with the locals and one should reserve it ahead if possible. We tried to book the afternoon tea once last minute but were told that they sold out. Shangri-la really pampered us. We were glad that the hotel was the last impression we received from Japan as we departed this country for home. We will be back to stay here again in the future as we are frequent visitors to Japan.","San Jose, California","baseballfreak</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",41,5.0

The combination of Japanese service standards + Shangri-La = outstanding experience!I was happy the moment we took the elevator up to the 28th floor lobby. It smells like Shangri-La, I think they must use some proprietary air freshener that sets off a Pavlovian response. The hotel is just steps from Tokyo Station, so it's very convenient to wherever you are coming from/going to. You do have to walk outside and around the corner, and it took a bit of effort to find the correct north exit from the station, but once we figured it out, it was easy to get around and easy to get the Narita Express train when we departed.Rooms are on the 29th - 37th floors of the building, so have wonderful views. We were upgraded to a corner room on the northwest, overlooking the train station and Imperial Palace. We could hear the trains rumbling faintly, not at all unpleasant or bothersome. It was a huge, beautiful room with so many thoughtful amenities - even a box of office supplies in the desk, including multicolored highlighters. The king size bed was the best we slept in anywhere in Japan. Lots of closet and drawer space (and hangers!), lots of electrical outlets at bedside and the desk. And the bathroom is huge, with a wonderful rain shower, tub with a fabulous view, the usual fancy Japanese toilet, lighted makeup mirror, three double robe hooks (!), a retractable clothesline, plenty of towels, counter and drawer space, and a wide assortment of toiletries. At evening turn-down service, they lay out pajamas and slippers for you. As gorgeous and comfortable as the room was, the thing that made it truly outstanding was the service. When we arrived, a wheel had just broken off one of our roller bags. First, they provided screwdrivers as requested so we could try to fix it, but we couldn't. When I asked whether there was a repair shop nearby, the woman from the front desk called engineering, and brought one of their maintenance guys up to our room, stayed with us while he worked on the bag and was successful in fixing it! Such a lifesaver. Breakfast was also excellent, though expensive. You can order from a selection of main dishes, either a la carte or inclusive of the buffet which includes your beverages as well as pastries, breads, cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit, Japanese hot items, etc. If you have juice and coffee, it's almost as expensive to order a la carte, you might as well do the buffet.Shangri-La is not cheap, it was quite a bit more than any of the other places we stayed in Japan, but it delivers a lot more - you do get what you pay for!","Seattle, Washington","Seattle98101</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",317,5.0

Finally, my experience in Chi Spa were among the best I've had, especially for the price. After a 14 hour flight from NYC, any massage would've felt good, but the interior design, accommodations, and treatments at Chi were 10/10. In my opinion, the only only possible drawback of the hotel is the small/cramped fitness area. There was a lack of space for floor exercises/stretching, and weights selection wasn't too great.

This was my first holiday to japan, and I truly believe they are the most impressive people I have ever encountered. Having said that, I honestly feel Shangri-La in Tokyo was a rather underwhelming experience. This place is expensive. I have been lucky to stay in shangri la in other countries (loved them) and many other 5 star hotels and resorts, but shangri la in Tokyo is the most expensive nightly rate I have ever encountered by a big margin. So I expected a lot. In hindsight, the hotel is fine for short business trips or luxury transit stops. The bedrooms are big and modern. This is a plush place. No doubt. Bed was very comfortable. Loved watching CNN in the bathroom while shaving. These things make it a wonderful place for a quick stop. However, for a holiday?? I wish I had stayed at Park Hyatt. Shangri La in Tokyo, is boring. The staff and customers are boring. There is a lack of excitement. Customers appear to be used to this luxury lifestyle. The type that live in hotels more than their homes? Staff are competent but not much more. A great hotel has the ability to raise your excitement and get you feeling relaxed and happy to be in the hotel. I did not feel this way. The gym and pool area was very small, single story and underwhelming. The view ordinary. Sterile airport atmosphere. The cocktail area. Expensive. A few drinks and your approaching a half day’s rate at the bar. No happy hour. The Piano singer on Saturday was nice but weekdays seem to be lacking any atmosphere. We made a trip to park Hyatt. Big place. Two story floor to ceiling windows overlooking Tokyo skyline. A 3 hour Happy hour. People having a good time. It was immediately clear we were staying at the wrong hotel. Overall the location of shangri la at Tokyo station was frustrating too. Having to take taxis everywhere, to Shinjuku and Shibuya areas. The Tokyo station and taking trains is too time consuming when you want to get out and get in. The buffet breakfast was limited but the food quality was fine. There is a clear difficulty in deterring what is complimentary and what is costly in your room. We were not offered a room upgrade as according to our Amex deal. Overall.

The Horizon Club staff were also, as usual, outstanding. They made checking in a very pleasurable experience as we were allowed to enjoy the fantastic view of Tokyo while the staff did everything. Mako Ishigaki, in particular was so nice to us. She spent a lot of extra time with my daughter, helping her practice her Nihonggo throughout our stay. She even created a birthday card, asking every member of the Horizon Club staff to sign it to mark my daughter's very special day. She seemed to be always there whenever we needed something.The location was perfect. Being next to Tokyo station, we could go anywhere we wanted. All facilities were well maintained and the staff always seemed to make our room perfect everytime. One thing I noticed here was that almost all the staff seemed able to speak good English. So for English speaking people who do not speak Nihonggo, Shangrila could be a good place to stay.Compared to Shangrila BGC however, the breakfast was below our expectations.While we had the choice of having breakfast at the Horizon Club, Piacere or in our room, the choices were very limited as compared to Shangrila BGC or Shangrila Hongkong.Also, the driver who picked us up at the airport offered very little help. Maybe, he was afraid that we would not understand him but he just dropped us off at the basement without saying a word. We did not know if someone would come and get us and it took us a while to find out how to get to the hotel lobby at the 28th floor.

My objections are more stylistic. I thought everything was a bit too ornate, in the rooms and in the common areas. The bar seemed somewhat soulless (and had too much cigarette smoke, even for Tokyo). These are not reasons to avoid the place. But the sensibility of a luxury hotel should match yours. This didn't match mine, and it felt obvious during my stay.

We went for this hotel because we have been to the London one in the Shard which is super special. We also went for Horizon Club which is on the 37th floor.The location is brilliant-with easy access to and from each side of Tokyo station-2 minutes from nearest door to the hotel. There is a pretty standard double elevator set-up to get to the lobby first of all and then on to the rooms. While pleasant, I did not find the lobby and lobby bar special enough especially compared with the Mandarin Oriental where we stayed when we first arrived in Japan. We checked-in at the Horizon Club on the 37th floor. The set-up here is great-it really does feel like quite a small private club with the Club rooms located either side of the lounge which is pleasant but slightly compromised by the available space. Views are lovely though. Usual lounge set-up with a shifting pattern of food and drink during the day and into the evening. The breakfast, which is combined buffet and at seat service, was especially good. The service is quick and attentive.However, however, the attitude with the service was quite mixed shall we say. First of all the passive/aggressive approach to closing time at 10pm which although not quite expressed that way was a fairly pointed ""drink-up and leave"". The same approach was replicated in the lobby bar. Second and worse, while some of the staff were lovely with our daughter (aged 4), there was clearly communicated lack of enthusiasm for her to be in the lounge even briefly in the evening-culminating in my wife and daughter being asked to leave the lounge for the reason that our daughter was wearing the slippers issued by the hotel! This experience upset my wife. I was out when this happened but I did not miss the customer service manager about it the next morning-she did deal with my complaint very well however. Hotel management: please make your mind up whether you want kids (and relative money) or not and follow-through consistently!! Our room was v nice and comfortable, but not awesomely nice in the way that the rooms in the London branch are. The pool is stunning-I mean stunning. Each changing area also has an onsen attached to it-very pleasant, apart from the sauna which in the gents at least seemed to be built out of plywood like a garden shed. Special word for the pool staff and concierge team who were super-friendly. Overall-given the cost and the special position as the last stay of our holiday, slightly disappointed but the hotel has a great deal going for it, especially location and if you want a pool.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","je22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",134,4.0

I found the hotel to be disappointing for a number of reasons. Firstly, no acknowledgement of Jade status was given, I was not offered an upgrade even though it seemed obvious to me the hotel was far from capacity. Secondly, the swimming pool. On the website, it stated that children could use the pool, however when we took our toddler there all dressed up and excited, the staff told us no one under four was allowed! He was nappy trained at the time, so there should have been no issue. I had to drag a screaming toddler away in tears and calm him down, he was deeply distressed. No one should have to experience that on a family holiday. The reception staff were less than helpful and the manager was apparently ‘not around’ when I requested to talk to them. I felt very much we were secondary to their concerns. The room was nice enough, breakfast was minimal but had some good choices still.

The front desk staff are second to none. The same can be said for the lounge staff. Ms Inoue (lounge captain) happily took time to give us personal recommendations that helped us to find the very best family friendly destinations in and around Tokyo. Fiachra went out of his way to make us welcome. Overall, an absolute pleasure and everything that we would expect from the Shangri-La chain. Our only disapppointment was that our toddler was not welcome in the Italian restaurant on site. As regular visitors, we appreciate that there is a policy regarding allowing small children into the in house restaurant in Shangri-La hotels. We would sincerely ask that the management reconsiders this. Other hotels of similar standards (the Hyatt in Kyoto for example) make smaller children extremely welcome with special menus and quiet areas. Other branches of the Shangri-La (specifically the Rasa Sayang in Penang) are, at the very least, prepared to make accomodations in order to avoid making families of young children feel unwelcome. This means a great deal. A little flexibility goes a long way to making a stay perfect. ",,Vikerri,16,5.0

Thankfully, ours were found (apparently common in Japan) and the follow through (a staff member picked up our documents which were in another part of town), good communication with us and amongst staff was extraordinary. Lovely rooms with an expansive view of the city. Nice workout rooms kept immaculately clean and a good indoor pool which was especially nice during Tokyo’s hot and humid temps. A few steps from the hotel, a Starbucks and Bellmart convenience store at the entrance to the train station served us well for breakfast and snacks. Location also provided easy train access, restaurants and shops in Tokyo station, and to the Ginza. We used the conciege a great deal and had very good experiences with their recommendations.

While there were plenty of servers, they seemed to look straight ahead rather than around. Unless you are making a windmill with your arms, they won’t see you. Refilling water etc. was not happening. Worst was the food service. With two people at the table, our food arrived 15 min apart.

Knowing that the Shangri-La is a premium 5 star hotel, we had high hopes and it completely exceeded all of our expectations. As most people have already mentioned, the hotel is beautiful with an impressive lobby, panoramic bar and art collection, but it’s the service that really blows you away. We were upgraded to a room with a view on check in and the staff had organised a welcome treat; a selection of luxury chocolates and macaroons encased in a chocolate heart, with a ‘happy honeymoon’ note signed by 9-10 different members of staff.The concierge, Mika, was just fabulous and took care of everything. We told her what sort of thing we were thinking for dinner each night and she called around 5 different restaurants checking availability and pricing before giving us her top 3 recommendations. As well as that, she helped book our Batto lessons and our train tickets to Kyoto, all whilst we were out in Tokyo exploring. Everything was confirmed over email so we knew what she had arranged throughout the day. Amazing.On our final morning over a coffee, we got speaking to one of the girls in the bar and once she’d heard that we were heading to Kyoto for the next part of our trip, she grabbed some paper and scribbled a few suggestions for places to eat and drink. Again, just such a kind gesture.Everyone we met at the hotel was so sincere, polite, respectful and it felt as though they all wanted to do as much as they could to help make our trip as enjoyable as possible. Rooms are also pretty impressive. Large, modern with good amenities and good views of Tokyo. We particularly liked the pjs which were provided every night with the turn down service. Location is great, despite being in the business district, you’re on top of Tokyo station with connections across town and also 10-15 min walk to Ginza and the Imperial Palace.We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in HK a week earlier and although it’s also an incredible experience, this was by far the best part of our trip.Next time we visit Tokyo, we’re staying here!",,Daniel J,1,5.0

Staff pleasant, helpful and courteous and quality of service and food on offer together with our large well appointed room with Bulgari toiletries thoroughly deserve a 5 star rating. The bed was super comfy and bathroom/wet room was superb. Highly recommend going for the horizon club option as not only are the rooms on the top floors giving an impressive view, but the breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails are included, served in the very plush 37th floor lounge. An added benefit was the provision of a mobile wifi ""box"" which meant that wherever we travelled in Tokyo, we could always connect to the Shangri La's wifi system - very neat and exceedingly helpful!One slight disappointment was that the ""meet and greet"" service did not materialise despite following instructions and letting the hotel know which train and carriage number we would arrive on. Tokyo station is immense and we wasted a fair bit of time trying to navigate our way to the hotel after an exhausting 12 hour flight. The hotel was very apologetic but it was a shame that somehow there was a breakdown in communication.We loved every minute of our stay there, my wife made good use of the swimming pool and if we return to Tokyo we would go there again without the slightest hesitation. It is a classy hotel quite easily on a par with the Four Seasons and Mandarin Oriental group of hotels we have stayed at in the past.","London, United Kingdom","JohnandAnna069</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",24,5.0

We also used their meet and greet service from the train platform for a near seamless check in process. Once I bought my nex tickets I simply called the hotel and they had someone meet us at our car on the train platform when we arrived at Tokyo station. We were in the hotel entrance after 15 minutes of lovely conversation and a brisk walk with our greeter. There another staff member met us and took us straight to our rooms. She explained all about the hotel and even confirmed our restaurant reservations. The concierge even sold us Suica cards for the train system! The room was impeccable and each afternoon they did an amazing job at cleaning and replenishing the room. The view were gorgeous and the location is great as it is central to a lot of places that with 20 minutes on direct train lines. Check out was just as seemless, and they walked us back to the train platform as well. Overall, I can't say enough positive things about the staff, their level of service, and the hotel it self.

When heading back to the airport, we'd have never made our way without the gracious young man who accompanied us (even though the hotel is a mere stone's throw from the station). He even stayed til the train left to wave us off! The same experience when we left on the train to Kyoto---we were accompanied every step of the way by a delightful young woman named-----. As a westerner, we felt really overwhelmed by the trains as surely the station at Tokyo must be one of the largest on the planet.As for the hotel---our room was beautiful; the restaurant offered a wonderful array of both continental & japanese fare; the lobby bar had a glorious view of the city; and we were made to feel special always---even to the point of everyone remembering our names.Yes, we put a card into the slot inside the door to activate the lights as a previous reviewer noted, but, that is, of course, to be more eco-friendly with lights and electricity. I appreciate that, whether a Days Inn or a 5-star hotel such as the Shangri-la.Our experience was delightful.

We utilized the lounge only once for pre-dinner drinks but they offer that with some light bites and are open to 10pm as well. The room itself was fantastic.

Wikipedia describes Shangri-la as a fictional place described in the 1933 novel Lost Horizon by British author James Hilton. Hilton describes Shangri-La as a mystical, harmonious valley, gently guided from a lamasery, enclosed in the western end of the Kunlun Mountains. Shangri-La has become synonymous with any earthly paradise, and particularly a mythical Himalayan utopia – a permanently happy land.isolated from the outside world.The first contact was the beginning of our permanent happy land and the difference to other gorgeous Hotels was the exceptional friendliness and professionalism of all the staff we met on our 4night stay I take my hat of to Management for this achievement.We where in a Horizon club room a must if you want to experience this place in its fullest.As fare as rooms cleanliness amenities bed quality furniture interior decoration minibar bathroom toilet gym pool wellness centre spa lift waiting time and the list goes on I could not find a fault , ohh the food deserves Gold plates if they don't have some already it was the best I have had but they take pride on the whole organic local and the best of the best ingredient thing and you notice it .Maybe this fictional place Shangri-la really exists as I think I found it in this Hotel.The only downside is once you arrived you don't want to leave so if you are in Tokyo and want to explore this exiting City to its max then go to a capsule hotel.If you are a connoisseur and want to experience Tokyo first class the seriously consider the Shangri-la.","Perth, Australia","Morimori57</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",1,5.0

Outstanding stay. Huge rooms, well maintained and well stocked [and frankly, BTW, the prices they charge for the minis of some stuff in the mini bar are very fair...almost too fair... ;-)]. We had a king room with an extra bed for our child. She loved the pool. I was fortunate to be able to stay again for a much longer stay.Now, we happened to be there on the weekend when locals really really love to enjoy the afternoon tea - apparently very popular and you must book in advance - I would hope that a hotel guest is accommodated if they don't manage to know this - but we did not have to test this theory. There was also a wedding.Now, normally I find locals to be generally respectful but perhaps people with money globally fall into a entitled state of mind from time to time. So we returned to our room and since the hotel was very busy, afternoon tea goers coming and going and wedding, and our room was not completed by house keeping. What to do? I ask the front desk if there is any place to sit. Other than the lobby, not really given the wedding so basically there is no place for us to sit and wait for the room to be cleaned other than the lobby - which is very very full of people coming and going as part of the afternoon tea. Which would be fine, but as I turn around there is some person (I assume local) ""man"" spreading on one of the benches in the lobby and with his bag on the same also on what could accommodate 3 perhaps 4 people was being enjoyed by one.I was not impressed and was rather jerky to the front desk which I later apologized for. I sat down anyway and then had my daughter sit to the dismay of the man spreader.It was only a minute or two later than we were taken to the horizon lounge to wait until our room was ready. This kind of response is why they are a five star property along with the fact that I swear the moment we left our room for the remainder of the stay they must have immediately sent house keeping to make sure our room was always clean before we returned. No request was too much and staff was great the whole time and it was nice to be recognized even thought I am a rather unimportant person. Would stay again in a second.

We were met at the airport by an English speaking driver in an immaculate car who whisked us to the hotel whilst answering all our questions about Tokyo. We had booked an Imperial Gardens View room but the gardens are some distance away and so the view is basically the city, not worth the extra money in my opinion. However the room itself was extremely well appointed with everything we needed. The shower and bath were together in a wet room arrangement and there were towels and bath products aplenty. Housekeeping serviced the room immaculately in the morning and at turndown. Breakfast is taken in their main restaurant. It was a bit hit and miss as staff did not seem to be assigned to particular tables which lead to a long wait to have an order taken and on a couple of occasions a duplication of orders arriving at the table. There is a cooked offer as well as a buffet - warning the pastries are to die for!The concierge organised restaurant bookings and a day trip to Kyoto on the Shinkansen, they even walk you right to platform at the main station which is just next door. We ate once in the hotel which was a bit of a farce, feeling a little under the weather I wanted something simple and so ordered steak with salad and a baked potato with sour cream (at least that is what the men offered) when it came it was a steak with a tiny new potato, a big quenelle of sour cream and a few vegetables. After some discussion the staff reluctantly took it off the bill.The small gym and infinity style pool hit the spot and there is a spa where I had a fantastic pedicure, the information in the room gives the impression that this service is not available and implies that there are limited spa treatments on offer so if you want something different it is worth asking. The hotel is right next door to a big department store and the Tokyo metro that will take you wherever you want to go in the city is a short walk away as are the Imperial Gardens.

I stayed here with my family for a spring break trip in march for 4 nights. We had a wonderful stay. I will try to be detailed with my review.Booking:My advice is to book with virtuoso. This gives you free breakfast/upgrade/ late check out.Arrival:We took the narita express from NRT. The hotel sent a bellman to meet us at the platform and escort us to the hotel and eventually straight up to the lounge. This was so welcome after a long flight with a bunch of tired kids. The tokyo station is a huge train station and im sure we could have been lost in there for awhile if we were on our own. Upon arrival at the lounge, we were offered drinks, checked in and given our room keys. Rooms: We had connecting horizon club rooms as we had a family of 5. We were also accomodated with a rollaway in the 2nd room. This gave us plenty of room. Bathrooms were huge and had nice showers. The rooms also had every type of amenity you could ask for including kimonos and pajamas(never seen before).Meals: We had the option of eating breakfast in the lounge or in the restaurant as i had booked through virtuoso. We chose to eat in the picatere? Restaurant as they had a bigger spread. Food was excellent. I reccomend the Japanese egg dishes. We also used our virtuoso credit for dinner in the lobby lounge and kids were able to eat burgers while i enjoyed indonesian food.Location: centrally located just next to Tokyo station. I didnt realize how great the location was untill after i got there.Concierge:They truly went above and beyond. They helped us book our shinkansen tickets to tokyo. They assisted us with dinner reservations and most importantly accomodated us when we needed to extend our stay in the same room. We had booked last minute and they had informed us that for the last night we may need to switch rooms as our particular rooms were already booked by another guest. We were not looling forward to this but thankfully they were able to accomodate us. Much appreciated.Housekeeping: rooms were kept spotless. In addition we did use the laundry services twice. They were always punctual.Gym: small but had great equipment and locker room. Was kind of full. I saw a pool.Value for money: good value when compared to other 5 star hotels in the area. Especially if u are lucky enough to get an upgrade.Overall:The small things really matter. Everyone always seemed to know my name and was always smiling. I could have stayed at any hotel i wanted to. I had initially planned to stay at aman but took a chance with shangri la as it ranks number 1 on TA, had great reviews, had connecting rooms and was significantly cheaper. I was not disappointed withy choice. I recommend shangri la Tokyo without reaervation. Lives up to the hype.The only negative thing that i can think of us that this hotel seemed to be full of people staying for buisness and we were out of place with our kids. ",,Imran M,1,5.0

It was all based on strawberries as they are just coming into season (little tip for the hotel though, as 2 English people we know scones and to serve 6 albeit small ones with one tiny teaspoon of clotted cream is not going to work. We asked for more on 4 occasions.)After that we were shown to our beautiful room with views out over the imperial gardens. The HUGE bed was extremely comfortable and the room generally had all the amenities you would expect. The pool and fitness room are brilliant and I would recommend you give them a go, especially as the views of the sun setting are gorgeous.We had room service a couple of times as we just wanted to relax and the food was excellent.All in all a wonderful couple of nights to finish off an unforgettable 2 weeks in this stunning country.","London, United Kingdom","Supertedbaker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",63,5.0

Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby.Rooms are spacious with aircon that actually works to the temperature you select! Extremely comfortable bed, fine linen, fluffy pillows. Excellent insulation - so quiet, could not hear anyone or anything - slept so peacefully! Bath and shower is enclosed in glass in case you need a view - great water pressure and large rain shower. The maid service was excellent - room was meticulously clean.Buffet breakfast is delicious - more than enough choices and hot items such as eggs benedict etc are ordered from an extensive menu. Restaurant pays special attention to those who are gluten intolerant, with choice of breads and dishes.For those who need to have a cigarette they have a special room on level 27 so you don't need to stand out on the street or if after 7.00pm there is a smoking section in the lobby lounge.Room service was excellent - high quality, well priced and good choices.This hotel has catered well for those with limited mobility - lifts of course and ramps for those who cannot negotiate one or two stairs. Those of us with one good knee have no issues here.To me, what sets this hotel apart is the service! Beyond comparison. If you are stuck at the train station and can't figure out how to get to the hotel, call them and they send someone to collect you. No request was too difficult and all staff are extremely courteous, knowledgeable and helpful. The staff treat any request as if it is a delight for them to serve you. I'd like to specially mention the young bell hop from Brisbane (am sorry to say I cannot recall her name) - her bright smile and friendliness made each day bright and I went off to work cheerful and optimistic, despite the sudden cold snap and snow!

The Horizon Club.....Absolutely book a Horizon Club room. The service is unparalleled. Suyeon Song is a godsend!! She remembered me by name and was a welcome face everyday. Not to mention took care of any special request with ease! After a long flight from the US, my son and I were greeted by Hideko Yamanaka like we were family. A special thanks to Yumi for personally greeting us and making sure that the pillow I left behind was happily waiting for me on the bed when we returned from Fukouka. Suyeon thankfully stored our bags while we made the trip to Fukouka and received my DHL package. Tea in the afternoon and cocktail our at night are not to be missed. By far, the best variety of hors d'oeuvres served at any executive lounge. They only seem to get better, with the smiling faces bringing offerings to your table. Awesome glassware and big ice cubes made cocktails even better!!The room........We had a garden view room for the first 3 nights and Suyeon graciously accommodated my request for a city view for the last 3 nights when we returned. The bathroom is amazing with a rain shower and soaking tub. I should mention the Bulgari products, first class. When we arrived there was a hand written note from Yumi welcoming us back. Make sure you listen to the CD thats in the room. I unfortunately didn't get the name, but it provided a great soundtrack for our time.Breakfast.....The spread in Placere is unreal. Fresh juices, mind blowing pastry, detox water(nice touch) and a ever changing array of choices made it impossible to avoid. The eggs benedict menu is fantastic!! I typically don't eat breakfast, but it became my favorite meal of the day in Tokyo. Kudos to the chef. Mako(didn't get her last name) is a stand out, welcoming us every morning. Unfortunately she wasn't working the day I departed as I wanted to compliment her on her amazing service. there was a german waitress(missed her name) who stood in wonderfully. The manager of the restaurant greeted me by name and shook my hand every morning. Traveling during Tet, the restaurant was extremely busy on a Saturday morning and we were forced to eat in the lobby dining room. Chinese tourists were as rude as can be, but he handled them with style and grace. He also apologized the next day for not being able to accommodate us the day before.Location.....The most convenient hotel upon arriving from both the airport or Shinkasen. It's walking distance to Ginza for shopping and Tokyo Station is a so fun to explore!The brand....I'm staying at the Shangri-la Bangkok in the next few days a look forward to finishing up my travels at the best brand in the hotel industry.Keep up the great work and can't wait to return!","Morristown, New Jersey","Eban42</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Morristown, New Jersey</strong>",10,5.0

I am usually loyal to a different hotel. But after my last trip, I will never stay anywhere other than the Shangri-La. Throughout our trip, we had a lovely stay at the Shangri-La, but it was the way they helped during an emergency on our last day that I will forever be grateful. Around noon on our last day, I was running around getting present for people back home. Coming out of the Tokyo subway station, I tripped on the stairs, cut my forehead open very badly, was bleeding all over and was worried I had broken my nose. Luckily, the Shangri-La is directly above Tokyo Station and two subway workers insisted on walking me back to the hotel. Within 10 minutes of arriving back in my room, the head of guest relations, Mr. Atsushi, knocked on my door and said he heard what had happened and asked if he could help. It was now 1pm and our flight back to the United States was at 7pm that night. I had gotten my American doctor on the phone and she said I urgently needed to have my forehead stitched up before I flew back.Mr. Atsushi immediately got on the phone, calling doctors, plastic surgeons, hospitals--really anything he could thing off to help. Meanwhile, I was lying down with icepacks on my face barely able to do anything. Somehow, unbelievably, after about 45 minutes on the phone, saying god knows what to god knows how many people, Mr. Atsushi turned to me and said, ""Ok, I have convinced them. Let's go."" He had somehow convinced the doctors at Tokyo University Hospital to perform surgery on me within the hour. Mr. Atsushi immediately guided me down to a taxi, drove with me to the hospital, guided me to the correct department, came with me into surgery to translate, stayed throughout and brought me back to the Shangri-La all before 3pm. It was truly unbelievable. Despite a horrible accident at noon, thanks to the wonderful people at the Shnagri-La, I was still able to make my evening flight back to Los Angeles.I travel extensively throughout the world and I can honestly say I have never experienced such an attentive, kind, concerned, and committed staff as I did at the Shangri-La, Tokyo. Truly, never write hotel reviews. In fact, this is my very first review because I feel that strongly about the Shangri-La. I have forever become loyal Shangri-La. Thank you to the whole team(especially Mr. Atsushi) for their dedication, true hospitality and concern for their guests.

This is a true luxury experience with a very solid hard product (fabulous deluxe rooms with distinctive interior design, very functional and full of amenities) that brings you on an exotic journey, with really lovely facilities such as the Chi spa and its fabulous treatments, the Nadaman restaurant for a really gorgeous dinner experience or the pool and its amazing views. The whole property is full of charm, mixing traditional and contemporary features just with the right balance that makes Japan unique. It is one of the best service we have enjoyed in Tokyo, and perhaps in the world. We felt really welcomed, well looked after and never, ever we felt this kind of overhyped/pretention that some luxury properties sadly have more and more.

Service was very fast and helpful. The concierge did a pretty good job helping us figure out how to get from place to place, especially as Tokyo's train system can be very confusing. They were very nice in helping us with reservations and confirming for us. A free service that we were so grateful for, was being escorted to the train the morning we were leaving for the airport. Like I said, it is really easy to get turned around in the train stations so a staff member walked us from the hotel all of the way down to the train platform. It was very helpful and they offered the service for free. They also helped us arrange train tickets, as we've had issues in the past of not getting tickets until the morning of, and the booth to buy tickets was not opened yet. So the hotel was great with that too. The gym equipment was top notch. It was definitely the best equipment I've seen in a hotel so far in my travels. The pool was beautiful and really great as well.

Handy after a long flight from Melbourne to get the N'EX to Tokyo station. The hotel is luxury +++ and has fabulous decor. We had a beautiful room on the 35th floor with an amazing view of Tokyo. The room was beautiful and the room amenities and small details for the guest were so impressive. I think the aspect that makes the hotel so outstanding is the staff and the service they deliver which was personal, warm and genuine. You can have good hotel but without good service and staff its nothing. Shangri-La Tokyo has the whole package and does it beautifully. The service at check-in was efficient and friendly.The concierge (I wish I could remember the gentleman's name...my apologies!) was so helpful, and so polished and knowledgeable. Zacky the Breakfast manager (such a gentleman) was a friendly face each morning when going for the hotels amazing breakfast. But the most outstanding of all was Erina (Guest service supervisor) who would light up our day when we saw her.

The toilet has a non-through visible wall made off silky glass but you can still see the shadow of the person sitting inside. Here I lack some privacy. The reception was very bad and slow.

The hotel decor is quite gilded and shiny (i.e. not very subtle) but it has a nice bar in the lobby-area with views over the city. The check-in process was smooth and we were shown to our room which overlooked Tokyo station. The room was quite spacious with a big bathroom.

Arriving by train at the Tokyo station, we were engulfed in activity and traffic. Luckily, we had found out which exit to find upon leaving the train station, and managed to exit the Tokyo station correctly, the Shangri-La is literally next to the train station.A discreet main entrance at the ground floor brought us into a beautiful reception area, where we were greeted warmly and our bags were taken care of, and we were whisked to the 28th floor, where their main reception is. First impressions the Shangri-La is a grand hotel, elegant and luxurious, yet incredibly discreet. It is not a modern hotel, best of all it was not teeming with activity, with people hovering around the lobby at any given time of the day. Check in was very quick and efficient, we were greeted warmly by name, and within minutes we were shown to our corner room. The room is incredibly generous in size for a Tokyo hotel, upon entry, the most beautiful expansive views of Tokyo were before us. Being the corner room, at the end of the corridor, it was also very quiet. Very large king size, looked like 2 queen size beds put together, and incredibly comfortable, we slept so well during our stay. Long comfortable chaise lounge lined the windows. A selection of cold drinks, sparkling mineral water, selection of teas and teapots, Nespresso machine and water kettle, and a welcome fruit basket were awaiting us. Generous amount of bottled water which were replenished everyday.Bathroom was equally spacious, toiletries were plentiful. Another drawer pulled out to provide any other additional amenity you could possibly need. Large shower cubicle with a delightful rain shower, and bath tub. Separate toilet cubicle with the wonderful Japanese washlet. Toilet was, needless to say, sparkling clean.Wardrobes are generous, they even provided a yoga mat, ironing board and iron. Both types of robes were provided, as were cotton pajamas for the night, in various sizes. Lovely fluffy slippers that were thoughtfully changed every other day.We left the room shortly after check in for dinner, and came back to it all turned down for the evening.Our room included complimentary breakfast, which we indulged in at the hotel's restaurant Piacere. The spread fairly boggles the mind. In addition to a vast buffet spread, a selection can also be ordered from the menu. My only criticism would be that they seem to be short of staff, empty plates littered tabletops and drinks orders took a while to be fulfilled. Kitchen also seem to be struggling with refilling juices so jugs went empty.Locationwise, this hotel is really convenient. With Tokyo station next door, you have almost every subway line at your service, without having to change trains anywhere. It is also walkable to Ginza.Special mention must be made to concierge service. Quite simply put, they are amazing. Some of the hardest seats to book in Tokyo at any time of the year, and during a busy period like Christmas, and they managed to secure seats for us. Of course, we also contacted concierge way before our trip, in order to give them ample time. Upon check in, all restaurant reservations were printed, maps given in color, routes charted, and even photos of the front of the building were provided. Absolutely stellar and for that I cannot commend them enough.All in all, it was an incredibly pleasant stay. This is one hotel I would not hesitate to return to.","Singapore, Singapore","WYMC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",206,5.0

We decided to go for the Deluxe Room on The Horizon Club floor( the reception for the Horizon Club is on 37th Floor ) as per our last visit and to my unexpected surprise they have upgraded my sister's room to the Premiere Corner Room which was very kind and generous . My favorite hotels in Tokyo are Shangri La and The Palace but I think I much prefer the Shangri La due to their unbeatable services on all fronts as well as the super convenient location ( it's next to Daimaru department store which has a amazing food hall as well as selections of great restaurants .The room itself ( Deluxe ) is on 36th Floor and very spacious with writing desk ,huge king's bed , sofa and a great size bathroom with Bvlgari toiletries .With breathtaking view off Tokyo skyline. All the blinds ( both day and night ) are electric as well as the blind in the bathroom . All other amenities in the room are great including traveler's adaptor and a great stationary box set. We take our breakfast at the Horizon Club on 37th floor and even though I thought the choices were a little restricted ( would like to see more fresh fruits -berries as well as granolas and better selections of bakery ) the service was top notch . I got my egg white omelet every morning and they were always perfect . As a guest at The Horizon Club you get tons of benefits . They have tea with proper afternoon tea sets complete with sandwiches and assorted baked goodies as well as pre meal snacks ( although my sister did have steak with potatoes so I don't know how that is a pre meal snack .It was a full on dinner ! ) and drinks at all hours free of charge . It was worth to pay that little extra to stay on The Horizon Club . Also compliments to all the staffs there who cater to your every need and take care of all your requests efficiently and with such attention to details I was amazed . I also use then gym whenever I travel to keep my body in check and to my big surprise they have upgraded their gym. When I was here last time the gym was tiny with very few useless equipments now the gym is still the same size but they made better use of space and have added more machines and equipments . The pool is also lovely . All in all it is the only hotel I would recommend ( only 18 mins walk to Ginza ) as it's my number one choice at the moment .

We stayed at 4 hotels on this trip and this was the best one.

The hotel is immediately adjacent to, but detached from Tokyo station.The room is large and everything is electronically controlled. The views are amazing and if you are facing Tokyo Disney, you can watch the fireworks from the comfort of your chaise lounge. You'll also have good views of the Skytree. I think the rooms overlooking the imperial palace are more expensive, but I'd rather have a city view any day (or rather night). The surrounding Ginza area has many upscale shops and Tokyo station is a great central hub for getting to other destinations as well as to Narita airport.

It was my very first time staying with the Shangri la brand despite their massive popularity amongst Travellers. It was a little tricky getting there as they have a shared building with office, which is very common in Tokyo. I had stayed at Mandarin oriental prior to moving to Shangri la and we had a little communication breakdown with the taxi driver though the staff from Mandarin oriental had briefed the driver in japanese. Despite the communication breakdown we managed to get to the hotel and was greeted with a warm welcome by the sales director. Check in was so smooth, however we were asked to wait for our rooms which is to be ready by 2pm. I have no complaints on that as we had arrived early by 12pm and made a little time for sight seeing at Shibuya which was little less than 20mins from the Jr station. What I loved about Shangri la is the strategic location just next to JR station- just what you need while in Tokyo to get around places. The rooms were tastefully furnished and the sales director took the time to explain all the work behind the exquisite and intricate detailing of the interiors across various parts of the hotel. The little site visit gave us more knowledge about the hotel. The breakfast at the Piacere restaurant was good. Shangri la is known for serving the best meals across the globe and we were certain when we had our breakfast. We also had lunch at Nadaman, is a world famous. Definitely one of the best Japanese lunch I've had. It's an absolute must try while in Shangri la-be sure to make an advance reservation as they are known for their popularity and a lot of business meetings are held there over lunch/dinner.My overall experience with Shangri was amazing and I would love to come back. They do offer a little meet and greet service to the Jr station which is complimentary for in house guest. Do take advantage of that amenity. I am attaching pics of my room and lunch.

They are all wonderful. But after recent visits to all three, my wife and I are irretrievably in love with The Shangri-La.Unlike the décor of some Shangri-La hotels we have seen, which we find a bit over-the-top for our taste, the Tokyo Shangri-La is restrained, elegant and beautiful. The rooms are very large and comfortable, and want for nothing. We were in a corner room, and even the shower and bathtub had an expansive view. The bathroom was huge and gorgeous. There was room to do floor exercises and an exercise mat thoughtfully provided, with an Nespresso machine to make coffee as a reward.The breakfasts are in a beautiful dining room, with a buffet that alone would be sufficient. But there is a menu with a broad selection of choices, and my Eggs Royale one morning and Eggs Benedict another were superb. My wife had a chinese breakfast and I tasted the dim sum, which were excellent. Breakfast is the equal of any hotel breakfast I have ever had.But what makes the Shangri-La Tokyo so special are the staff. We are nobody in particular. But from our first visit in 2015, we were made to feel welcome and special. We were greeted by name at the front door (how do they do that?), and most staff greeted us by name throughout our stay. The concierge was wonderful, helping us with a complex set of rail tickets. The front desk is so well staffed that we have never had to wait for assistance. I can’t say this hotel feels like home—who lives this way at home!?—but we did feel welcome and special. Oh, and one more thing: The Shangri-La is smack next door to Tokyo Station. You can take the Narita Express from the airport and walk in a matter of minutes to the hotel. The hotel will meet you at your train car at your request, and when it’s time to leave escort you to your departing train car. Tokyo high-end hotels are wonderful. We have stayed in most of them and they have earned their excellent reputations. The Shangri-La belongs in that pantheon, and for us is at the top of the list.","Berkeley, California","JerryF20</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berkeley, California</strong>",14,5.0

It was an amazing experience. Unfortunately, our flight to Tokyo was delayed and we arrived after 10pm with 2 tired kids in a new country. We purchased train tickets from the airport to Tokyo station and called to inform the hotel. Once at Tokyo station, we saw a hotel employee waiting for us; and she quickly guided us to the hotel before my daughter could melt down. Once at the hotel, the check-in process was equally quick and easy. The front desk receptionist even kindly walked us up to our room. The Horizon lounge was elegantly decorated and the food was delicious. Our two kids have severe food allergies (anaphylaxis) and even though we inform most hotels ahead of time, we always have to re-inform them again and even then mistakes are made. Here, they brought up the food allergies. My one child has milk, peanuts, tree nuts, and sesame allergy, while the other one has wheat and tree nut allergy. Usually it takes a long time to make the ""special"" foods we order because of issues with cross-contamination. I was also sure that with the language barrier, the issue of milk allergy will be confused with lactose intolerance. I was pleasantly surprised. Food arrived so quickly that I remember thinking that at least we have 8 epipens and a bag of zyrtec, benadryl, and prednisone to cover us. To my surprise it was both delicious and safe for the kids. The kids ordered multiple things on the menu and normally we would be told that certain food could not be accommodated because of certain recipes. Here, they accommodated everything and it was all delicious. They even provided gluten-free and dairy-free sandwiches during afternoon tea. The concierge suggested a double-decker bus tour of Tokyo which was just perfect for our 20 hr layover in Japan. Then a hotel employee actually walked us to the bus tour where she helped us purchase the ticket and placed us on the bus. I can't say enough about the service and attention to detail they provided during our short trip. Lastly after we checked-out, a hotel employee walked us directly to our train platform. To our surprise, she stood waiting for our train to arrive and place us in our seats. At that point, we thanked her for her time but she left only after giving us her card with a number to call in case we needed help.

It is located near Tokyo Station, which means there are lots of dining and shopping options nearby (including Ramen Street, with many excellent ramen options, all at reasonable prices (for Tokyo). The Daimaru department store is literally around the corner as well. The only minor downside is that some Tokyo cab drivers have no idea how to find the hotel or the entrance to the hotel (which is underground). It's not a huge inconvenience because they can drop you off at street level and you can take the elevator directly to the lobby (28th floor), but there is occasionally some confusion, despite the excellence of cab drivers in Tokyo.But that's a minor quibble.

Based upon price, reviews and location, I chose the Club Room at the Shangri-La. I could not have been more impressed. There were usually no more than a dozen people in the Club Room at a time, with 4 to 5 attendants. Excellent French champagne, Bordeaux wine and great snacks. Starting with a made to order breakfast to all you really need at night to eat if you have been out sightseeing all day. Moreover, they send an attendant to meet you at the train station and help you return. Although they explain on their website that the hotel is only one minute from the northern exit of the train station, what they don't explain is that you have to walk though a maze for about 15 minutes to get there from the train from the airport. Sending someone to help lean the way and take care of our 2 heaviest bags was really fantastic. In addition, the rooms were great. More attention to detail than I have ever seen.

The location of the hotel is good, next to Tokyo central station and convenient for getting around the city. The room was of a very good standard and the hotel and staff were nice.The big let down for this hotel is that the breakfast room is far too small for a 5 star hotel. We did not get the impression that the hotel was particularly overrun and yet we still had to wait 30 minutes for a breakfast table for 2. That is simply unacceptable in a 5 star hotel. The staff did not distinguish between size of parties when allocating tables, meaning that we saw a number of 4 person tables with only one guest seated at them. I felt there were too many 4 seater tables when perhaps better use could be made with 2 seaters with smaller chairs. Additionally the hotel should seat guests in the Lobby Lounge (this is not open for breakfast until late in the morning: it should be) rather than requiring them to stand in a queue for half an hour.

For example, the walk to the Palace was pleasant.Property:We stayed on the Club level floor. The club was nicely appointed wth good selection of drink/food. The breakfast was great with options for full western, Japanese, Chinese breakfast in addition to good selections in the buffet. You also had the option to eat breakfast at their restaurant and lounge at no additional cost. The room itself was nice...not the best appointed place we have stayed at but nice. A minor issue...there was a glass wall between the bath/shower area and the bedroom...which I found more common in Asia. I can draw down the blind but even in that case, if I get up to go to the restroom in the middle of the night, the light leakage disturbs the other person in the bedroom.Service:The check-in was a little bumpy. The lobby is not located on the first floor. When we entered the building, the one person stationed there directed us to the main registration level instead of the Horizon Club level since we booked the club level. We carried our own bags to the front desk. After check-in there was no bell staff to help with the bags. The desk person who checked us in carried the one bag that she could manage while we carried the rest. Not sure if this is SOP or if they were short staffed. All other experiences concerning service was excellent. The staff at the Horizon Club desk was especially helpful and friendly.Spa:If you choose to get spa treatment, I would suggest that you make sure everyone is on the same page on what treatment exactly you will receive. I reserved a 90 minute Swedish but apparently what I ended up getting was one of their fancier treatments. At no point was the options discussed with how much it would cost until I was presented with the check. I know it is gauche to discuss money but guests need to know what they are getting for what they are paying. The spa treatment and facilities were excellent otherwise.Gym:The gym was disappointing. There were a few selection of free weights and the choice of machines was not extensive. Minimal...Summary:This is a nice property. Not the best hotel we have stayed in Tokyo. I would rate Mandarin Oriental and the Park Hyatt higher with more of a ""wow factor"" in the lobby and common areas. If you are a cigar smoker, the only option for you is a small glass smoking booth in the lobby level with no place to sit. There is no place to smoke even outside the hotel. One thing that Shangri-La has that the others did not is a more convenient location for getting around on foot...and the Horizon Club.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","SixpackDC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",114,5.0

From swiftly opening elevator doors, taking suitcases and escorting us to where we needed to go after seeing as wander in from the rain like drowned rats on the day we checked in, to providing us with an unexpected and much appreciated bottle of wine upon us mentioning in passing that it was someone's birthday, to the personalised note that it came with, to personally escorting us to our Narita Express platform at the confusing Tokyo station, to even returning a bottle of mouthwash (!!) that we left in the room upon checkout - it was flawless. The staff's mannerisms are warm and genuine too, not robotic and automatic.The Horizon Club lounge- smaller than some other Shangri-La properties' lounges but stunning nonetheless, with all day snacks, formal high tea, all day drinks, and table service which was unexpected. Usage of iPads for business and printing was appreciated too.The room:- stunning. I don't need to mention the usual comfortable king size beds and classic Shangri-La style and fragrance, that is a given. What was unexpected were little things like premium Japanese teas and a traditional cast iron teapot, wonderful kimonos and slippers taken out for us at turndown service, and the most amazing hotel shower I have ever seen - how can I get one installed at my place!?The facilities:- small but well equipped gym- a beautiful indoor pool with wraparound views of Tokyo, what a luxury- nice touches like bottled water and fruit by pool and in the gymSee you next time I am in Tokyo!","Gold Coast, Australia","s4172249</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast, Australia</strong>",128,5.0

Yes, they did the basics such as dining reservations, subway meet and greets exceedingly well, but the following are a few of the above and beyond items:- their breakfast buffet is exceptional. I've never been so excited to eat at a breakfast buffet. It was stunning. My husband, who rarely eats either breakfast or sugar and flour, devoured it.- their Director of Public Affairs, Cynthia Usui, befriended my son after noticing that he came in with some Japanese superhero characters. She sought him out while we were at tea, translated the content on the tags, researched things for us to do, left him character based treats in the room, and surprised him multiple times during our stay with gifts and attention. It was very, very special for all of us. Being dragged through Tokyo by your parents isn't always the most fun time for a 7 yr old, but Cynthia really made him feel special.- while small, their gym was clean, staffed, and we appreciated having it available.- the service - from the staff at the ground level all the way through the team doing evening turn down service was exceptional. Yes, I expect this- especially in Japan, but usually there's one part that falls through somewhere. Not here- every single interaction was perfect.Thank you Shangri La for exceeding my very high expectations.

It is well located next to the central station, which meant getting to the hotel from Haneda airport was both easy and quick. We were met at the station by the hotels concierge service who carefully guided us to the hotel and check in. We later used the concierge service on a number of occasions and found them to be wonderfully helpful and knowledgeable..in fact they really couldn't do enough for us and were an amazing asset to this hotel.The room (a deluxe Imperial Garden View) was spacious and luxuriously equipped. The Imperial garden view it offers, it has to be said, is actually several blocks in the distance beyond the station and so while factually correct, isn't quite the view 'overlooking' the garden that I had wrongly expected. However this was not a problem in any way.We ate once in the hotel and had an incredible teppanyaki dinner in the Nadaman restaurant, beautifully cooked and presented by our chef . Again the service and hospitality were exceptional and I can highly recommend this experience.Having been to Japan for work several times before, travelling this time purely for pleasure at 'Sakura' time, was made especially enjoyable by our stay at this wonderful hotel.","London, United Kingdom","steven b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",30,5.0

This was our first visit to Tokyo, and others had previously told us that hotel rooms in Tokyo were quite small. When we walked into our room at the Shangri-La, we were very pleasantly surprised. The room was huge! We were fortunate to have a room on the 32nd floor, overlooking Tokyo city. The hotel itself occupies the upper floors of an office building, which is adjacent to Tokyo Central station. So it is in a very good and central location, which is perfect for exploring Tokyo. It is also a short walk to the Imperial Place, where you can explore the gardens. The Ginza District is also an easy walk from the hotel (approx. 15 minutes). Our accommodation in the hotel was excellent - a huge bed, beautiful bathroom with walk in shower, a coffee machine and an evening bed turn down service. The hotel buffet breakfast was amazing, with so many food choices. All hotel staff that we dealt with were friendly, professional and accommodating.

We started our trip in Tokyo at the Park Hyatt. We have just arrived at the Shangri-La. Bother hotels are amazing. I spent a lot of time researching both of these hotels. If you are choosing between the two I think Shangri-La is a notch above. I am on the club floor. The view is just as incredible as the Park Hyatt. However the pool area and spa are better in my opinion at Shangri-La. The staff are incredible. I haven't seen my daughter since my 60th birthday so this is my celebration and they have made it very special for me. Thank you. The position is absolutely perfect. Right next door to Tokyo station. We got in a cab at the station and he literally pulled out then pulled back in! We could have walked but the driver seemed ok about it, so it isn't a problem if you have luggage. I am so happy with my decision to stay here. Only thing is we may not do much sight seeing. We just want to stay in the hotel! I'll do an update when we check out and have tried the restaurants and cocktails! I'm not sure but I don't think the Park Hyatt had a club lounge. That in itself is worth choosing Shangri-La!

I am not a frequent writer about my hotel stays, but I felt compelled to share my observations about the Shangri-La because of the high quality amenities and superb service at the hotel. The Shangri-La brand is not {yet} as well known as other luxury hotel brands in the U.S. It is rising in popularity among Europeans, and it is already well known to Asians.The Shangri-La is located within 2 minutes walking distance from famed Tokyo Station, which provides easy access to all of Tokyo's exceedingly efficient transportation as well as the Shenkansen bullet trains. The hotel overlooks the Japanese Imperial Palace and Gardens, where the Emperor still resides. The hotel is visited frequently by business men and women, but also increasingly, by tourists. It is located near Ginza, and it is easy to get anywhere in Tokyo from the hotel. All of the staff interacting with guests are fluent in English.The hotel occupies the 28th through 37th floors of an elegant business tower in the Chiyoda area. Rooms with Imperial Garden views are priced higher, but the views in all directions are inspiring. I stayed in Room 3703 which was a Deluxe King Room located on the Horizon Club floor. It is more expensive to have access to the Horizon Club services, and I am glad I made the choice I did. I have no doubt that service is equally friendly and professional in all areas of the hotel.It should be a given that service in high-end hotels would be top notch, and the reason I decided to write this lengthy review, is because of the perfect, by my lights, service I received. The service was professional, friendly, considerate, thoughtful and insightful. Simply put, this is about as good as it gets. Every interaction I had with concierges and staff members had the same result which was a complete response to what I was seeking fulfilled professionally and with the utmost respect and consideration. I'll provide a single illustrative example. I was on a quest for a particular out of circulation Japanese currency bill, and I asked the Horizon Club concierge where I perhaps might be able to find this. Of course, she made the call to a nearby bank to find what I was seeking, as one assumes she would.. As she was giving me directions to the nearby bank, my briefest hesitation conveyed that I was uncertain about how to navigate amongst the nearby tall buildings to get to where I needed to go. Within a heartbeat, the concierge asked if I would like her to escort me there. I otherwise would have gotten lost.My room was beautifully appointed and the food was excellent in each site at which I ate in the hotel, including the breakfast and evening hors d'oeuvres in the Horizon Club.I could go on, but enough is enough. Suffice it to say that in addition to The Shangri-La having all the expected components of a luxury hotel in Tokyo, the service was perfect. I felt like family while stayed there, as was the intention of the staff. I would like to be more balanced in this review and provide at least one criticism that might help other potential guests who read this, but I am unable to do so.Domo arigato gozaimas to the people who work at the Shangri-La.","Virginia Beach, Virginia","harvn1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Virginia Beach, Virginia</strong>",2,5.0

We spent 7 nights there and were mentally prepared that we are in a top notch hotel in the heart of a city with one of the highest real estate costs. As a family of 4 (with kids of 14, 11), however, the room was really small even by our low expectations. It was classily done and the bathroom was fantastic. But how do they (and most hotels in Japan) expect two individuals to share that single bed is beyond our comprehension - especially a room that charges in excess of $500 a night. To pay that much and not get a decent night's sleep seems unfair. Once the rollaway bed is put in, it is almost impossible for 4 individuals to be able to move around and put any bags anywhere.The room service was quite good - good variety although breakfast left a lot to be desired. The service was excellent. The main concierge lady was excellent - she was very helpful, informative and everyone there was very good and helpful. Set the standards for service quality. Very conveniently located right on top of Tokyo Station but there are no signs from within the station. Good walk to Ginza and trains to anywhere you wish to go.Also located next to Toyota Rent-a-car, which had really poor service - and don't believe them when they say the GPS is English. The keypad is in Japanese and you really cannot enter anything!It was disappointing that getting a largish taxi (to accommodate 4 individuals with 4 bags) was not feasible from the hotel thus forcing us to take 2 taxis to the Haneda airport.","Gurugram (Gurgaon), India","rnmg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gurugram (Gurgaon), India</strong>",41,4.0

I knew it was adjacent to Tokyo Station but even with his GPS system, the taxi driver coming from Narita had trouble finding the main entrance. (Hint - the motor entrance is below ground, one level below street level.) The building sits in the middle of the block, easy to find by foot but a challenge perhaps for drivers.The Shangri La hotel chain is my ""go to"" hotel choice around Asia. I have stayed at the Island Shangri La in Hong Kong for 20+ years; the Shangri La in Singapore was my preferred hotel for almost as long; I like both of the Shangri La's in Shanghai; the facilities in Bangkok and Beijing are wonderful; and thankfully the Shangri La Sydney is finally improving its caliber of service. Although I have been perfectly happy staying at the Peninsula Tokyo the last few years, it does not have a club level with club level amenities. So when Shangri La finally opened a new hotel in Tokyo, I decided to try it. And I'm glad I did.There are valid reasons why Shangri La's Horizon Clubs are a magnet for business travelers like me. If you're traveling with other work associates, the clubs offer a quick easy place to rendezvous for breakfast to map out the day's agenda. If you need copies made for a presentation, they can do that. If you need to book a lunch reservation somewhere across town, the Horizon Club staff will do it for you. And on those evenings when you don't have a business dinner, the Horizon Clubs offer a nice place to have a cocktail and some light snacks. (To be honest, a few Shangri La's over-sell their Horizon Club to the point they are so crowded to the point you can't find a seat. Singapore's Tower Wing is a big offender in this regard.) The Tokyo Shangri La however get's it right. The Horizon Club's service is extremely personalized, which is exactly what you would expect. The breakfast they offer is well done, as is afternoon tea and evening cocktails. By the second day, the club staff is calling you by name and already knows whether you prefer milk or cream with your coffee.This is a relatively small hotel in a big, mixed-use office building immediately adjacent to Tokyo Station. The days I was staying there, I needed to take a bullet train to different cities both days. From the hotel lobby, I was literally a 15 minute walk away from the track I need to depart on. (Don't worry, the windows of the Shangri La are double-paned and you hear nothing. The floors which the hotel occupies are at the top of this new high-rise.) You cannot be more centrally located than Tokyo Station! The Imperial Palace is two blocks in one direction and the heart of The Giza is two blocks in the other direction.If you have stayed at a Shangri La anywhere in the world, you know what to expect. And knowing what to expect for frequent business travelers like me is a good thing. Beautiful decor well executed, spacious guest rooms, big marble bathrooms, a large desk with multiple electrical outlets, wonderful beds with both firm and soft pillows, an iron and ironing board (a rarity in Tokyo), a safe big enough for a large laptop, shoe trees, and in most cases free wifi throughout the hotel. The Tokyo property does not disappoint in any of these regards. In addition to the small but perfect Horizon Club, this hotel offers something I haven't found elsewhere in Tokyo - a lobby bar that serves an amazing American-style cheeseburger with fries. Now, I really love Japanese food but sometimes you really crave a good burger. The one here is amazing! And they make a perfect martini. I want to commend this hotel for handling an unusual situation. My first night, shortly after I fell asleep, the fire alarm went off. After about a minute of a very loud blaring horn (and a flashing warning light for hearing-challenged guests), I realized maybe this wasn't a false alarm. I grabbed my pants, wallet, passport and room key and carefully opened the door (after feeling it for heat). The hotel already had staff in the hallways advising guests to stay put while they investigated. It turns out it there had been smoke in the basement but it did not require evacuation. The staff kept everyone informed of what was going on and the next day apologized to each guest for the inconvenience. I never got to the health club, so I cannot comment on that. Nor did I eat in their lobby level tablecloth restaurant. Based on everything else I did experience, I will be back. Even though I thought I knew what to expect, the Tokyo Shangri La exceeded my expectations.",Chicago,"Chicago60657</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago</strong>",21,5.0

From the moment we checked in everyone greeted us so warmly and professionally. The service is impeccable but not over the top where you feel there is an intrusion to your privacy. If your budget allows upgrade to the Club Level Rooms so you have access to the Horizon Club. The staff makes a concerted effort to get to personally know you, greet you by name and are so helpful. Even before we arrived the team at the Horizon Club assisted with so many arrangements from Train Tickets, Dining Reservations and went so far to have a someone from the Bell Staff escort us to the train station. And that is where we had the chance to meet Moe - the best brand ambassador there can be. It's these special touches that make staying at Shangri-La such a wonderful experience.This particular location is directly across from Tokyo Train Station so it makes it very easy to get where you need to go for all the different Tokyo train lines - even the ""bullet train"". The hotel is very discreet and quiet but yet warm and inviting. The rooms are lovely as we stayed several years ago in a smaller room, but it was still roomy by Tokyo standards. This time we stayed in a Club Level Suite and it was very comfortable (just need to get a better blow dryer for all the female guests).

We received word a week before arriving - by personal long-distance phone call no less! that the Horizon Club floor would be taken over by a delegation (we were told later by locals it was probably the Saudi Royal Family). We would have to be moved with the club lounge to another floor or we could cancel our reservation without penalty. Worried but too overwhelmed by last-minute details of our trip, we decided to make a go of it and thought we would be looked after anyway. ""Looked after"" was an understatement. From the quick response by email on the NEX train to be met at Tokyo Station right outside our NEX train car, to the beautiful food choices at the Club Lounge, to the spacious, luxurious room, the Shangri-la exceeded our expectations beyond our dreams.Our room was almost a corner room on the 32nd floor and we had a stunning view of Tokyo and the Tokyo Skytree. The room had everything we needed; the bed was a bit hard but was quickly made softer by the housekeeping crew at a moment's notice and was perfect for the rest of our stay. Every day we would come back to an immaculately clean room. We are at a loss for any criticism but to split hairs, we found the lighting in the rooms a bit dark and would have liked higher wattage lighting.We decided to take our breakfast every day in Piacere for more selections; we were not sorry as the breakfast buffet though not huge had many sumptuous choices, specifically the exquisite pastries all themed for spring, some with delicate icing details and strawberry fillings. The Horizon Club was seamlessly moved to part of the Lobby Lounge, and though we experienced one night in the actual Horizon Lounge before the temporary move, we felt we did not have any lack of service or amenities. It was wonderful to come ""home"" after 6 or 8 hour days to the lounge, have a very nice afternoon tea, then have enough appetizer food choices to make an early dinner (as we did for quite a few nights as we were too exhausted from site-seeing) plus more desserts until 10 pm if you wished! We also found the next-door Daimaru Dept. Store restaurant floor good for reasonably priced dinners. It was also nice to chat with the Horizon Club concierges about our day and they were truly interested and engaged without being obtrusive.Each and every member of the team, I am sorry to forget their names as they were all special, could not do enough for you. From arrangement of Disney Sea tickets, getting our Japan Rail Passes activated, to our luggage being shipped to Kyoto, everything was done quickly and efficiently. Also we were offered escorts to and from Tokyo Station as often as we wished - it is truly a mini city in itself and very overwhelming for first-timers. We found the Nihonbashi Station more manageable and used it for most of our excursions. However if you do find yourself braving Tokyo station, remember the Yaesu exits will get you back to the hotel, Yaesu North being closer. With the use of a pocket wifi (complimentary for Horizon Club guests) and Google Maps we got to and from Tokyo Station and around Tokyo quite well. Google Maps, Google Translate and the Hyperdia apps and pocket wifi were invaluable for our trip all over Japan.You will not find better location, views and 5 Star value in Tokyo than the Shangri-La; trust me I had researched them all. Let the team at Shangri-La take care of you, especially if you are a first timer in Tokyo. At the end of each day, they will truly make you feel like you are coming home.

Then, I told them that I want to cancel it, they said they're sorry, and offered me to take something from the bakery.

I usually attend business conference in Japan, but I prefer it over the conference hotels which may be more convenient as I feel that I sleep and rest better here. I also prefer the location as it's a short walk to Tokyo station where are lots of shops including Yoku Moku cookie store and character shops (e.g. Miffy, Hello Kitty etc) where I can buy souvenirs/gifts. However, the standout character of the hotel is its high level of quality level. Most 5-star hotels in Tokyo usually don't disappoint on services, but I still found the telephone operator, room-service order taker, or concierge desk to be exceptionally well-trained, prompt and courteous. One time I asked a front desk person if I could eat at the Japanese restaurant a few levels (I believe) above the lobby; he tried to call the restaurant and, when there was no answer, he literally sprinted up the stairs to get an answer for me and came back breathing heavily. I certainly appreciated the effort even tough I decided to eat in the Italian restaurant on the lobby level instead. Another time I asked the front desk person to help me book a seat on the Narita express train; he asked me to leave the ticket with him and did it, but I later realized (after staying at the Prince Park Tower Hotel) that he must have walked all the way to the train station to get me the seating arrangement as apparently it was not doable online or by phone according to the Prince Park Tower Hotel.I am not sure if it's location or luck, but I have had a lot more luck getting a taxi here than i ever did at the Four Seasons. Both hotels tried to help you with taxi of course, but it seems like a taxi is always waiting at the Shangri-La in the B2 level and can respond quickly. In terms of food, the Japanese breakfast (room service) is also among my favorites; although it's not inexpensive it's reasonable by Tokyo standard and I prefer it over the one at the Four Seasons, also nearby. If you have time, you must have the egg Benedict in the lobby restaurant for breakfast; it's among the best I have tried around the world. I have also had dinner there, but the experience is more mixed with dinner as table service was draggingly slow. And of course you are paying hotel prices.One small complaint is the small gym which can feel a bit tight with all the exercise equipment if you want to work out. The pool is nice and the locker room and sauna/spa are both nice and well-maintained.Value for the money is hard to say; I think it's well worth the money if you are not going during peak seasons (e.g. April). The price can double (as I discovered) during these peak tourist seasons.",,Charles Y,10,5.0

Emailed the hotel and got the confirmation for the reservation within less than 24 hours. My kids and I are huge Miyazaki film fans and we wanted to visit the Ghibli museum. The tickets are sold 3month prior to foreign visitors and there were no tickets available for our April visit. I could not get any tickets even after searching for numerous websites even willing to pay the extra fees. Again, emailed the hotel and they confirmed our tickets, for our very first choice entrance time and date. And it actually costed us fraction of what we would have paid if we had bought tickets through third party travel websites. They were prompt, professional, and got the job done. It was the most competent concierge service I have ever experienced.

It's also a short walk away from the Imperial Palace, which is one of the few places where its easy to get a long uninterrupted run in in this city.Service was great - concierge helped me with a difficult to get reservation and the bellhops were super courteous and did a lot of logistical nonsense for me.

In terms of bling, hotels can rival each other in terms of jaw-dropping design and use of luxe materials. It only depends on how deep the pocket is. However, when it comes down to service, the choice of staff and the training provided can often give it an intangible quality that elevates the hotel above others. Too much effusiveness on the part of the staff can be stifling and too little comes off cold. The Shangri-la in Tokyo got the formula just right. Amazing staff that are warm with just the right touch of personal care made us feel like we were coming home each time we returned after a day of sightseeing. From the doorman to the attendant at the Cake counter to just about everyone, we met on the way to our room, we were always greeted with a bow and a smile and a warm greeting. We never felt like it was a put-on and felt genuinely happy seeing the staff each day as well. We upgraded to the Horizon Club level and this became our home away from home. Part of the upgrade package includes daily breakfast and evening canapés and drinks in a buffet style. The food is excellent throughout and the upgrade package is IMHO good value for money. You also get to check out at the Horizon level and it also acts like a concierge service. In fact, the staff booked our Disneysea tickets for us while we were having evening drinks. The room we stayed in was a Premier room at 65 sqm. Lavish as per Shangri-la standards, it was in impeccable condition. The bathroom with separate bath and shower in one 'room' was very clean and the Japanese toilet has a heated seat which certainly was a comfort in winter! In terms of the hotel's location, you certainly could not ask for better. Located in The Marunochi Trust building, it is literally next to Tokyo station, a vast under and above- ground metropolis that not only hosts the Shinkansen service and local trains and Metro but also a mind boggling array of shops and restaurants that could rival a suburban mall. Daimaru has an enormous multilevel store here as well. We have, as per many who travel often, stayed in countless hotels. Very few would offer the right combination of service, quality and value that would make us come back for more. Still fewer would, in our mind, qualify as a home away from home. The Shangri-la in Tokyo certainly fits this bill to a T.",sydney,"pj388</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>sydney</strong>",12,5.0

The general manager, Mr. Marcus Bauder, has been doing an incredible job to this hotel, and we could see his imprint; his staff seem genuinely happy and dedicated. The Shangri-La Tokyo goes above and beyond: prompt and helpful services, in addition to giving us the directions and instructions, we were personally escorted to the ticket counter at the Tokyo Station. Furthermore, the staff pays meticulous attention to detail, and nothing was amiss: the rooms were spotless, the toiletries, treats, and welcome amenities were beautifully wrapped and arranged. It was also very heart warming to be consistently addressed by name and welcomed back every time we returned. Kudos to Mr. Nicholas Liang and Ms. Erina Sasaki who have made our stay memorable.

Other second-tier Disney hotels were charging between $750-1,000, hence hubs thought the Shang would be a better option since it was right at the Tokyo station, which connected directly to Maihama station via the Keiyo line. We ended up choosing the Horizon club room which offered really good value for money.A proper extra bed was set up for our 6 year old. This is important to us as we like to have abundant sleeping space for the three of us. Many hotels in Tokyo barely have room for one to move around after putting in the luggage, let alone an extra bed, so this pretty much sealed the deal for us. There was no lack of space after putting in the extra bed. We even shifted its position ourselves as it was originally placed directly under the air con duct. A complimentary LTE wifi device was provided. The battery was able to last the entire day, unlike the ones provided by other hotels we have been at, which lasted only a few hours.The horizon club deal allowed us to have lounge access for breakfast and cocktails. The canapes and desserts were not extremely tasty, however, the quality was acceptable and we also enjoyed our cocktail drinks. For breakfast, we were able to access the main buffet on the 28F, which offered a bigger spread. The eggs benedict selection was excellent. We enjoyed the scones, danish pastries, oriental noodle, nutella pancakes, nasi goreng, and the juicy sweet honeydew! The coffee could be stronger, and temperature slightly higher. The best part about the package was the ability to have complimentary in-room dining. We chose this option the days we were visiting Disney.Amenities-wise, we were pleasantly surprised with the pjs, which were changed daily. The bvlgari toiletries were light and not drying on the hair and skin. Stockings, miniature shiseido facial toiletries, loccitane hand cream were also provided but I did not use them. On the third day, housekeeping provided a toiletry kit meant for children, as well as kids-sized bedroom slippers on the second day. We appreciated the gesture, especially the thought. One tip for the hotel - our kid couldn't quite reach the sink so toothbrushing was a bit of a challenge. Some hotels we have been at provide a small step stool. We were sure it would have been provided had we asked, but we simply got our kid to tiptoe as high as she could. We did indicate via email our request for a water ionizer, support pillow and bolster, which were in the room the moment we checked in. The hotel provides a meet and greet service if you take the narita express. All you had to do was email your flight details beforehand, and call them once you have your train cabin and arrival time details. This is an extremely useful service for travelers like us with young kids and huge luggage. The hotel also provided a guide to bring us to the train platform for our disney visit and departure for Osaka, and assisted us with translation as we purchased our suica cards and nozomi (bullet train) tickets. Our first guide even remembered this was hubs fifth stay - very impressive. From a location perspective, we struggled with food. There were no lack of restaurants but somehow, they failed to satisfy our foodie desires. When we were staying at the Peninsula previously, the concierge had delighted us with food recommendations around the area. We didn't have much chance to properly check out food options with our concierge this time round. Will test it out the next time we are back. We can't wait to be back!","Singapore, Singapore","Rokugatsu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",83,5.0

When presented with the bill we were surprised to see a daily service fee of 14% on top of the price that was quoted and when we asked what is was we were told it is a 'tip' for turning down the bed at night. We booked five nights and they only turned down the bed twice on the other two occasions I had the 'do not disturb' light on and one night we did NOT leave the 'do not disturb' light on only to find a card outside our door the next morning. We have been charged for five nights and they only came twice. In some countries it would be illegal not to declare all fees at time of booking or check-in. It adds quite a bit extra to your bill. Be careful if you use in tea/coffee making facilities in the room we could not work out which ones were complementary or which ones you would be billed 800yen so I went and bought my own coffee and tea. Rooms are very big and beautiful. Pool area although indoors lovely and gym looked good. I was very impressed that the staff had set us up as non Japanese speaking guest so when we experienced an earthquake (6.9) at 6am in the morning we had a siren and message alerting us that we are about to experience an earthquake ( all this in Shangri-La book so I was well prepared when I heard the siren). Great location very beautiful part of Tokyo. Very convenient for Tokyo station and business area. This is our second visit in twelve months but not sure if I will stay here again because of the service fee (tip) I know it sounds petty but I really love honesty and all fees should be disclosed at time of booking I'm not sure if they think if they add this fee into your daily rate that they would loose a lot of business because guests would be so shocked at the daily rate.,"Mosman, Australia","Carolinethetraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mosman, Australia</strong>",30,3.0

Everything is so extremely lavish! The hotel paid every attention to the details of all the areas, from lobby, to the restaurants, to the rooms, to the pool, to the gym and sauna etc. For a 5 star hotel, of course I expected the place to be clean, the staffs to speak English etc, and yes, Shangri-La Tokyo passed this. But not so on food, I will elaborate more below.The Location is superbly good, just next to Tokyo train station.Staffs are superb helpful and polite. They tried their very best to assist me. They made me feel like home. In fact, better than home.The normal room is super spacious, they have separations for toilets, wash basin, bath, and then bedroom. I never felt the lack of space at all.Breakfast was provided for my case. From 6am to 10am, you get to choose from a list of the ala carte menu, and WITH buffet too. But from 10am to 11am, you only get to choose from the ala carte menu. Such generous for breakfast hours, 6am to 11am!!! The hotel hopes you can eat to enjoy, rather than hoping you not to eat to save cost. Having said so, the food quality is not consistent, sometimes on par, sometimes sub par 5 star standard. The ala carte pastries are not warm, they are left to cold. I have ordered Japanese meal from their menu, the grilled salmon fish was overly salty, cold and overly cooked. I fed back to the waitress, she offered to replace another set, but I was already quite full. Also coffee served is not fresh from the machine, it is from a hot tumbler. I was expecting hot and freshly brewed/pressed coffee, so was a bit disappointed. I then ordered for a cup of cappuccino, it was expecting human intervention in making it, but it was straight from the machine. Again disappointed. On the other note, the dim sum served in the buffet are was sub par. In short, food quality is not consistent, and therefore sub par of 5 star standard! The pool is heated, both the indoor air and water. Free flow of fruits and juices and water. So you wont starve during or after the exercise. The changing room is equipped with a cloth spin machine, meaning you can leave the place with your ""washed"" clothes that are almost dry after spinning at 1500 1600 rpm.There are airport limousines directly at B1, so I never had any issue of transferring to the airport. Overall, I am VERY happy with the hotel. Even though food was sub par, the other areas e.g. the lavish furnishing and deco, the ultra helpful staffs, the location etc have outwit the shortfall.In short, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!","Singapore, Singapore","cyqaey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",63,5.0

For business and leisure. For years, I wanted to try this Shangri-la Hotel because of its location and I am also a loyalty member. However, the price was always very high and I always found better deals with other competing alternatives in the same category. This time, I found the price acceptable. When we arrived, the entrance of the hotel was not very visible. In fact, you cannot see the entrance. It's either by taxi/car/bus you have to head down to the basement of the parking to access the basement entrance (where the bell captain is) OR you have to walk behind a building to see the entrance. I felt this hotel was more of a ""service apartment"" more than a Shangri la Hotel.The location was one reason I really wanted to try this hotel. However, it turned out to be a disadvantage for us. We did not like having to walk so far to the metro station. The entrance of the metro is only 5 minutes away (one block) but the actual subway train tracks are quite far away. To access to Ginza line, it was 350 meters to walk to. JR station is next door, but the tokyo station is so big and so busy, it was quite stressful to go in and out each time, we ended up taking taxis so many more times than usual staying here.Check in was smooth and quick. Concierge was superb prior our arrival, helped me by email to book all the restaurants I wanted. Room was great. Beautiful view of the SkyTree. We got the 34th floor. The main entrance is very small. The staff at the main entrance never even greeted us or helped us with elevators, our shopping bags.... unlike other luxury brand hotels. Lobby at the 28th floor also lacks ambience, and is again, quite small. I didn't like that there is never any staff at the elevators. No one greets you. No staff or security either at the elevators that go up to the guest rooms. You don't need the room key to access the floors. The amenities and FREE wifi are good things about this hotel. Size of room is good. Housekeeping does a great job. Pillows are very soft. I dislike this very much. Upon my request, housekeeping gave us buckwheat filled pillows, which were very small in size, like for child. Wasn't comfortable.Check out- called for bell captain, perhaps it was a busy time for them. Took them 20 minutes to come get out luggage. We took a taxi to Haneda Airport, which the bell desk reserved and put all our luggage in the taxi upon our arrival from lunch at 1pm sharp. That was impressive.Never saw any of the management. Only three or four staff always at the reception/concierge. We would consider staying here next time if the price has promotion. But at the usual rate that is offered, I would prefer my usual hotel next time I visit Tokyo.

This was our first time to Tokyo and the staff were very helpful with tours, restaurants etc. Their staff met us at the airport and escorted us though to the transfer car, on departure one of their staff escorted us to the check in counter.We had a tour that required us to get to the other side of Tokyo station and a staff member escorted us on both days and offered to be their on our return to assist us getting back to hotel.I could go on and on.

Although everyone I encountered was fabulous, looking back there are definitely a few team members that deserve special mention. From the moment I entered the property I was so warmly welcomed by Ms. Yumi Tsujimura and the Horizon Club staff. After a very fast check in process I was taken to my room.I hadn't even met this first special team member, yet I struggle to find the right words to express just how touched I was by the wonderful gift Noriko Seimiya left waiting for me in my room. In the Horizon Club I was made to feel right at home, starting with Ms. Hideko Yamanaka. Her professional handling and speed at which she dealt with all matters was very impressive. I can not express strongly enough at what a wonderful team Ms. Yamanaka has and how smoothly things run under her guidance. Although I never really saw the housekeeping staff, my room was always magically put back together and spotless regardless of when I returned back to the room. I appreciate there dedication to detail. The laundry service promptly picked up my items and returned them swiftly spotless. All staff members in the Horizon Club Lounge made all my dealings there so enjoyable. It didn't matter when I entered or passed by the Club Lounge, they always greeted me by name and with wonderful smiles. They could not have been more helpful and I was very impressed when several of the staff remembered me from my October 2015.  This now brings me to someone very special on your team, Horizon Club team member Ms. Ayaka Sekino certainly took the whole Shangri-la hospitality to another level of making me feel very welcomed.

One of the several five star choices available in the high-end market in bustling Tokyo. Beyond excellent service and first class accommodations, I like this hotel largely for its location. It is rather centrally located for touring or business in the city and is literally right next to the main train station. Its location is a huge positive for making the Shangri-La your selection over some other options in the city. They even offer a complementary meet and greet at the train platform upon your arrival with baggage assistance and a most welcoming staff member assigned to greet you as you exit your train. The same service will escort you and deliver your bags back to the train for departures. Once at the hotel, you enter on the main floor and take an elevator to the reception area - the hotel is situated above an office and retail area. Some will consider this a detraction, but I prefer the higher floors for less noise from the traffic below and Shangri-La does a wonderful job with interior appointments to make this transition seem luxurious. Rooms are spacious and beautiful, the beds are soft by Asian standards - which makes them super comfortable and all of the linens are superb. Our bathroom had a shower and tub and every possible appointment. There are two dining and lounge areas near the reception desk for guests that are lovely - offering wonderful food and service. However, the hotel could stand to improve the management of these areas to reduce guest frustration with wait time or lack of available spaces, as these areas are also frequented by businessmen and other outside tourists not staying at the hotel. The location, the gorgeous view and the upscale atmosphere attracts too many, but could be turned into yet another positive for the hotel with some management of non-hotel guests being limited to certain spaces. The food served to our party through dining and with room service was excellent throughout both of our stays in 2016.

Nothing was too much trouble. Communication in advance of our stay (discussing arrangements for our young son) were straightforward, and we were made to feel very welcome the moment we got there. Our airline had left our pushchair in London, and promised to put it on the next flight. That meant getting it 24 hours later, which would have been a huge inconvenience had the hotel not stepped in straight away to have a pushchair put in our room. And, when our son was ill with a mildly upset stomach, there was no fuss at all. Within minutes, two people were in our room helping out.I've spoken before about how good the rooms are. We didn't have a corner room this time, but still had one overlooking the Palace. Be warned, due to the buildings around Tokyo Station, the Palace is barely visible. However, that doesn't detract at all from what is a dramatic view. Our son certainly enjoyed watching the trains come and go.The room was very comfortable. The bed is great, giving us a near perfect night's sleep, despite a jet lagged toddler. The bathroom had everything you needed - plenty of decent products, and a good sized bath and a rain shower. Of course, had we had a corner room, we could have taken a bath overlooking the city, but this was still fine.We took breakfast each morning, and there was something for everyone. Delicious juices, an abundance of fruits and pastries, and a hot selection (covering Asian and European/North American dishes).It really is a gorgeous hotel. Sumptuous decor and some stunning art in the corridors. Minutes away from Tokyo Station, it is easy to get to once you know your way. If you've not been before, be sure to take advantage of the ""meet and greet"" service. Just get in touch with your train details (including carriage and seat number), and they will meet you at your train door and guide you through what must be one of the more overwhelming stations in the world.Highly recommended - we've stayed twice now, and although expensive, it's a great place to stay if you can stretch to it.

Had extra bed put into the rooms for free for the kids. We are Golden Circle members and the staff were very thoughtful... they put little teddy bears on the kid beds! :) They really liked that personal touch and have both brought back their bears to the states! Thanks to the very thoughtful staff at Shangri-La, they had a great time!The rooms are huge, I believe 700+sq ft, twice the size of the standard hotel rooms in Tokyo. My parents had a corner room, their ""king"" bed was HUGE! It's like a whole person bigger than a Cal King! you can literally sleep 4 people in that bed! Décor is modern but of the Shangri-La classy look. Not your contemporary modern but has a warm wooden look. That huge window with great commanding view of the Tokyo skyline is probably one of the best in the whole city. Hotel is on the 28th floor, our room was on the 32nd... there were no buildings taller than 20F next to us. Relaxing by the window and looking at the Sky Tree was a treat. I am sure if you are on the other side and have view of the imperial palace, it would be even more enchanting.Staff were very courteous, rooms are very clean. We got good recommendations from staff for eatery suggestions. Location next to the North east entrance to the JR Tokyo station is very convenient. The station is HUGE, with Dai Maru Dept store and many eatery selections. So the location of the hotel is very convenient. We had the hotel staff meet us at the Shinkansen platform, he guided us from the platform (straight out from the train's exit door) to the hotel. It's free service from hotel. They cannot bring luggage rollers to platform but he helped my parents with two of their carry on luggages. We had a great stay at the Shangri-La Tokyo. We will be back.

I chose the hotel for its proximity to the Tokyo Station/N'Ex and used AMEX FHR to book for the guaranteed late check-out. (Japanese hotels are known to be strict about check-in and check-out time.) We were all very, very impressed by the exemplary service, especially at the Horizon Club where all the staff spoke good English and showed genuine hospitality. They would offer to buy N'Ex tickets, escort service to the train platform, and would often ask to make sure we had everything we needed.The room is nicely appointed, but that was expected for the pricepoint and level of accommodation. It's not as large as a standard room at the Peninsula (which is a great hotel in its own right), but still spacious. With a view towards the Palace side, it was very comfortable in western decor infused with Japanese touch such as having the tub inside the walk-in shower enclosure and the availability of pajamas. Booked a 60-minute stress relief massage at the spa at the last minute and enjoyed the relaxing treatment as well as the facility. Though I didn't use the gym or the pool, they are free for hotel guests, unlike some local chains. The Club lounge serves good hors d'oeurves in the evening that could almost replace a meal. We had a choice for breakfast at the lounge or at the restaurant on 29th floor, and we decided to eat down there. There's a very nice buffet section with a good spread of western and Asian dishes, and on top we would order a main plate from the menu such as eggs benedict, pancakes etc.There are hotels in many cities that can offer similar level of comfort in terms of amenities/facilities/hardware, yet I was particularly pleased with the exceptional service demonstrated by everyone I have interacted with at the Shangri-la Tokyo.

They have a concierge service that will pick you up and drop you off on the platform if you are coming from Narita on the express train - reason being it's quite difficult to find the hotel on your own through the maze of tunnels and walkways.

There is a pool with amazing views across imperial palace direction, overlooking Tokyo station. The gym had good functional equipment with sports drinks and juices at times. The sauna and hot tub was fantastic especially after walking around all day. Free wifi throughout the hotel. Eating: we ate at Nadaman and the manager there (sorry forgot his name) looked after my dietary requirements, and ensured our night was perfect. It really was! The most amazing Japanese food ever tasted, and it was as excellent both in taste and aesthetics.Room:The best Bose sound system we have ever heard. The bed was big, very comfortable, with a range of pillows on offer. Loccitane toiletries. Massive rain shower head and separate bath tub. We initially had an east facing room, which had amazing views but unfortunately because of the weather outside, would expand the metal structure of the building and create a popping/banging sound, every 30 seconds usually from around 5.30am to 7.30am.

Concierge - picked us up from tokyo station and walked us to our hotel. Greeted us by names everyday. Ive never felt more welcome each time i enter. They made such a big difference to my stay.2. Location - maranouchi is beautiful for walks. You can walk to imperial garden. The tokyo train station is right across the hotel which makes everything quite convenient. On taxi: We got a discount on our taxi fare going to haneda airport bec of shang. Not sure how. I did not even request this. Cab driver just deducted. From hotel to haneda, it was 6700 yen. Meter reading was 7k+ 3. Shopping - its a must for ladies like us! One need not look far as daimaru is right across the street. Inside the train station. I also took a stroll around the neighborhood and went inside the beautiful maranouchi building. There were a few well curated shops inside including united arrows.4. Room amenities - need i say more? Shang uses nespresso, jasmine scented l'occitane products. Beddings, pillows, room temp were all perfect. 5. Breakfast - splendid! This one i will definitely miss. I love the opulent interior of the breakfast area. Not to mention the food. Fresh strawberries and kiwi! Im in heaven. You can order poached eggs adorned with truffle on top. Everything was exquisitely done! 6. I want to say a special thank you to shang for the lovely cake they sent to our room for my fathers 74th birthday. The butler lit so many candles to signify 74! And it was such a yummy cake too. Im grateful that i chose shangrila for this tokyo trip. They made it one of the most unforgettable. Tip: if you love your vinos like me, they have a wine cellar with very reasonably priced bottles. Must get a table with a view! Lovely experience!!!!!!!

Great amenities and fabulous shower. The room was a non-smoking room, but unfortunately you could tell that it had been smoked in recently. I would have asked to change, but we were a late check in as it was.The fitness center was average for a luxury hotel. They had a terrific lap pool and a handful of cardio machines. There was not enough in the way of free weights or machines to get in a serious weight lifting session, however. The service at check in and check out, as well as the bell desk was very friendly and professional. We checked in around 10pm and grabbed a light dinner and drinks in the lobby lounge. My biggest complaint about our stay was the service in the lobby lounge. It was terrible for a 5 star property, and in my experience, very unusual for Tokyo in general. We had to ask for menus, wine list, and had to ask more than once for water. Our dirty plates and utensils sat in front of us for 20 minutes without being cleared.Overall, it was a good location and great room, but I didn't really find it a good value for the price.

The view from the lobby and the bar was outstanding and you could see Tokyo nearly 360°. We were given room 3724, which I think is the best room of the whole hotel complex. I don't have time to write that many paragraphs describing the degree of luxury and perfection required to describe the room. I could just say it's been the best hotel room I've ever stayed in with the best view and amenities. All of this three steps away from the concierge. Her name is Tamoko; was a fine lady and provided my wife and I with superb and exquisite service with attention to detail and made our stay there outstanding. She got us tickets for several events eight floating sumo matches and local regional theater. We spent four nights and five complete days and this hotel, which was perfectly located. They even had bicycles for rentals, which were the best way to get to know the Giza district.I strongly recommend this hotel for those who want to visit Tokyo in style and comfort.

The service alone is impeccable. I received several emails before my stay confirming my arrival and departure time. Once they learned I was coming in by train they offered their free pickup service. I was picked up by the bell hop service exactly on time. It was raining that day but she brought umbrellas for the both of us. She greeted me with a smile, verified my name and took my bag. Once she realized I didn't speak Japanese she immediately switched to English! The walk to the hotel is sooooo quick, the longest part is inside the train station. The hotel is right next door! She chatted with me during the walk and asked if this was my first trip to Tokyo. She was very nice and allowed me to take her picture for my trip collection. Once inside she escorted me directly to reception for checkin and took my bag to my room! I arrived around 1100 so I was expecting my room not to be ready but right away I was checked in. The receptionist spoke excellent English and I was checked in quickly. She gave me a free meal card for being a member along with the wifi information. Surprisingly my room was ready and she escorted me to my room!! I didn't have the room I wanted (premier) but I WAS NOT disappointed. I had a regular king deluxe room and I was blown away. The amenities are fantastic and the service is top notch. The mini bar is stocked! Alcohol on first shelf, assorted teas and coffee with a coffee machine and a tea set to make tea on the others! Fridge is stocked as well with some snacks in there. The closet has the usual things along with a umbrella. The bathroom area is nice with the shower and tub in a room with a small step down. There is a window in the shower area so you can still see the view, but a curtain of course if you want privacy. They had snacks waiting on the desk and my bag was in the chair. They have a drawer of things you might forget and if you use anything it's replaced the next day. I hung up my dress for the concert later and left the room for lunch and when I returned there was fresh fruit and silverware waiting for me. I went to hang something else up and noticed she had given me really nice plush ladies hangers for my dress and nice shirts!!!! What a nice touch that she noticed I brought dressy clothes. My heart melted from the attention to detail. For lunch I ate in the lounge and true to fashion service was excellent. The food was delicious and when someone didn't speak English they immediately sent someone else over to help. The view was beautiful as well. I left for the night and attended a concert, the taxi area is on the ground floor and I never had a problem. They give you a card for the taxi so you have no worries getting back to the hotel. If no taxi is there you wait inside in the area comfortable from the outside. Once the taxi arrives they make sure the driver knows exactly where you are going! Talk about seamless service. Upon returning from the concert they always say welcome back! They open the doors and always get the elevator open and press the floor for you. They even helped me take pictures of my outfit and when I put my things in the chair they picked it up and held it! I ate a late dinner in the lounge, was taken to a nice table which offered some privacy cause I was still dressed up. I ordered the chocolate martini and was blown away when it came. It was in a bag and it was smoky! She opened the bag and the chocolate melted! The service was quick and the food hit the spot. Back in my room the bed was turned down with slippers placed by the bed, a pair of pajamas, bedtime story on a bookmark and a bottled water with a glass by the bed. I felt like I was being tucked in for the night. The next day I decided to have lunch in the lounge before heading out to shop and sightsee. I was immediately seated at the bar area and once again when they realized I spoke English they made sure my server did as well. She gave me a stool for my purse!!! I think this made me never want to leave, someone understanding that you don't want to put your expense purse on the floor is heaven. I decided to get the afternoon tea option and was pleased. It came with little sandwiches, your choice of tea from a menu, a variety of scones with jams and honey and a variety of cute desserts. I was helped by so many people I felt important! When I went to refill my tea cup someone immediately came over and poured it for me!I left the hotel again by taxi and was given another hotel card for the taxi and the staff made sure the taxi took me to the right place. I returned hours later tired from shopping but was greeted with a smile and a welcome back. They got the elevator again and pressed the lobby floor. Each time you walk through the lobby you are greeted with a smile. After a quick nap in the most comfortable bed ever I had my free meal in piacere. Oh goodness, the food was good! I had the ribs, meatballs and potatoes. I didn't feel like a cocktail and wanted a soda instead. They apologized that only the lounge offered sodas, but not to worry that they walked over and got it for me. The service was the same, seamless.I returned to my room and noticed the maid had put the things I left out (comb, lotion etc) in the bathroom area on towel and all setup for me. So sweet of her. My bed was once again turned down, with fresh water, fresh pajamas, a new bedtime story and slippers. The view from the huge window is massive but the curtain offers a electronic night and day option if you choose to sleep in. I checked out the next day sad to leave. The check out was a bit slower because my rate was different than when I booked. But they apologized for the delay. I was given directions from the bell hop ladies of which way to go once inside the station. As I was walking in the station there were some bell hop ladies heading to meet another family. They noticed me from the hotel and took their time to make she I got to the right train!! I arrived back at my platform on time and ready for my train with no worries. I can't say enough about this hotel and their staff. Yes it is a bit expensive but you get what you pay for! I am extremely happy with my the service and hotel and I'm planning another Tokyo trip just so I can stay here again. Don't look at the price just book it!!!

We had a Horizon club room on the 36th floor with partial views overlooking the Imperial Palace grounds and looking down onto the railway station. The room was very large with a big bathroom, bath and independent shower, couch area in the main bedroom with lots of electrical kit, electric blinds for daytime and electric curtains for nighttime, TV in the wash basin area as part of the wall. Various switches for lights and a plug and charge area for phones, tablets and so on. The quality was exceptional. Then we come to the Staff, they couldn't do enough for us, the club lounge staff were out of this world! Great views from the club lounge over parts of the city. Underground shopping malls, the subway, the railway station all minutes away from the hotel, Ginza no more than 10 mins walk, the Imperial Palace about the same.Breakfast in the lounge is really good, both hot and cold options available, also able to take breakfast in the main restaurant.

The location at one end of Tokyo station is convenient, and the greeting service at the platform if arriving by Shinkansen very helpful. So as far as the room and hotel facilities are concerned, it's absolutely first class. However I do find the service at breakfast a little too intense, and feel that because the staff are always rushing, they tend to frequently lean right across people with minimal warning; this, I don't like at all, and pointed it out a few times. My single greatest disappointment (probably over the last decade) relates to my room booking here made on points. At check-in I asked if it would be feasible to change to a twin-bedded room. It was not essential to change, just simply that I was suffering from a Sakura allergy and thus twin beds would be less impact on my Wife and Daughter. My room was changed but there was no mention whatsoever by reception staff of the associated cancellation charge plus an additional points charge, which I only discovered a day after arriving home in Thailand. Yes, on reflection the T's & C's do mention the conditions for changing a room, but it's amazing that reception staff cannot highlight this to a guest? Imagine if such treatment was replicated with routine everyday retail transactions and you discovered multiple additional charges on your credit card statement at the end of the month because staff had not mentioned associated additional costs! Any Golden Circle members will realise how much Shangri-La Hotels have been promoting Loyalty recently, so I truly find it astonishing that staff at a hotel of this standard could be so deceitful. I would sincerely hope that all of the Shangri-La Tokyo management are not supportive of the manner in which this room change was handled; this is a lesson to anyone else who might find themselves in a similar situation at this property.

It's hard now to stay at other hotels after you have been to an amazing one like Shangri-La. It was funny that we would leave our dirty clothes in a pile by our luggage when we went out for the day and when we returned at night, the hotel staff had folded our dirty laundry and placed it neatly on the couch! I have never been to a place where they fold your dirty laundry for you! So if you don't want it folded, make sure you stuff it way down in your bag lol. The staff really makes this a great place to stay, my husband had left his phone on one of the bullet trains we had taken and because we didn't speak Japanese fluently enough for converse with the police department, the hotel staff actually took care of the whole process for us and got our phone back. On top of that, my husband left his wedding ring on the bedside table after we checked out and the hotel staff ended up mailing the ring in a little pouch back to us with a kind note telling us thank you for staying with them and if there was anything else they could do to please let them know! The server for breakfast was super nice, polite and on point with the service. The people at the fitness center kept that place spotless. I know that i was sweating when I was working out and they always kept the water bottles stocked and I know that as soon as I left they were wiping down all the equipment and making sure it was ready for the next person that came in. The spa was excellent as well. The massage therapist I had did an excellent job. Seriously I can't say enough good things about this place, and I know that when we go back to Tokyo this is where I want to stay at again.

Although I am a member of the Golden Circle which is a loyalty club reserved for previous Shangri La occupants. I have all my life stayed at the Imperial Club for my previous business trips. However my trip this time is purely leisure to have time off with my wife and kids. It may be a bit pricey as it is a five star hotel. All the restaurant outlets are excellent from La Placere the hotel coffee shop to the Nadaman the japanese restaurant also offers excellent steak and shabu shabu. And of course with their requiistie tempura. The lobby bar also offers excellent nightlights of Tokyo. But the location is very strategic located right next to the Tokyo Station which is perhaps the main hub of Tokyo city. The hotel itself starts on the 28th floor as it is located in a Marunochi Trust Building. And the hotel goes from the 28th to the 38th floor. I have not expected my stay at the Shang to be a disappointment as I have stayed with them at their hotels in Cebu, Makati and Kuala Lumpur plus viewing their sprawling maginificent resort at Shangri La Boracay which is truly world class if not one of the finest resort hotels here in Asia. However the service and staff here is impeccable. I could not ask for more. They do get out of their way to assist you in whatever needs you may have. Service at the lobby bar and their Japanese restaurant Nadaman is tres excellent. Even their coffee shop Le Placere offers excellent service, this is where we have our breakfast. Although the buffet seems minimal and mundane, you do get an extra choice a la carte from the menu and which i normally order their eggs benedict as they do have several variations of this egg classic. The rooms are most modern with all the push button amenities and one could be initimidated at first like with the toilet bowl with the push button bidets but as one gets used to the buttons, one would find how forward thinking the japanese are. As these toilets are normally available only in Japan. Even the showers and tub have the most aesthetic designs, one would be given a sense of freedom as one indulges in the shower. I have not seen as big a shower head as i have seen in this hotel. I have only stayed at a standard de luxe room. Yes the rooms are roomy and not your standard tokyo size hotel. The beds are long and you do get enough head space in the rooms. Never do you feel claustrophic at any point in the hotel. The staff here is very friendly sincere and of course very japanese in their demure. I did check their health club and their swimming pool which is located i think on the 29th floor. It does have a spectacular view of the city especially by the pool. My 5 night stay here is most wonderful and memorable. It is centrally located where the airport limousine bus final stop is here at the hotel, All subway stations are linked at the Tokyo station which is adjacent to this hotel and takes around 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. And as a runner a most wonderful venue for a morning jog is the Imperial Palace making ones stay in Tokyo most treasurable as the palace is a runners' paradise. The shopping around Tokyo is also most accesible, as taxis abound and most shopping is around 5-10 minutes by cab from the hotel like Takashimaya or Mitsukoshi department stores.

One should really not have to do this at a 5-star hotel. The other thing is that I was slightly underwhelmed with the breakfast spread.

I was a bit worried about regretting eating in (since there's so much good food in tokyo!), but the quality of the food more than answered that question.Similarly, the minibar was well stocked (see my FS @ Canary Wharf review for what NOT to do at a minibar in a 5-star hotel!) -- given the recent increased popularity of Japanese whiskies, i was delighted to see the hotel had ample selection.Overall, every aspect of the Shangri-la was enjoyable; i did try a different but comparable hotel on my previous stay, but needless to say, that was a mistake -- the Shangri-la is still the best place to stay in Tokyo's city center.","New York City, New York","jpg28242</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",32,5.0

We arrived Monday 7th March about 12:30 pm and once we got there they took our luggage and took us up the lift, they then took us straight to our room and I got to check in inside the room which was really nice and got to have a shower before going back out as sitting on plane all those hours so it was nice to be able to freshen up. Also booked birthday cake for my daughter as it would be her birthday following week whilst we were there, they also gave her teddy which is cute. The room is lovely size and view was great, my girl loved watching the trains. Bath and shower I loved. And free WiFi in the room is really helpful and didn't need Internet during the day. The checking out was just as easy and a member of staff escorted and took our luggage to the platform for train to airport which is good as It would off taken me lot longer to find it, I did forget my prescription glasses at hotel and didn't realise until I was on the train, did get up at 5 in the morning so was half sleep lol and sent email and the reply I got was brilliant and that they are sending me my glasses back which is good as it would cost me quite bit to get another pair. I can only praise the hotel and the staff and hope we get to come back one day as it made our holiday even more amazing especially being right next to tokyo station exit which is so convenient.

Weather went from 60 deg to 37 deg during our stay but we had a wonderful time nevertheless. Not yet as crowded and some cherry blossoms already on display.I went back and forth booking our hotel - looking at several hotels, particularly the Peninsula. I was very glad that we finally decided on the Shangrila. We did check out the Pen lobby and although both locations have their pros and cons, I think that the Shangrila location is better all in all. I liked the Shangrila lobby better as well. Even before we arrived, the concierge was very helpful re: booking our dinner reservations and tours. The Meet and Greet option was brilliant. After a long flight from the US, being met by someone at the Tokyo train station was very helpful. Tokyo station is gigantic and it would have been difficult to navigate it that first night.We booked a Club Horizon room and was given a room in the 37th floor with views of the Imperial Garden. As mentioned by others, the Club room option is really worth the money. We opted to eat breakfast at the restaurant downstairs (Piacere) - more variety. You can choose one hot item off the menu and then avail of the breakfast buffet. I chose the Japanese meal every day and it was delicious. But you can eat breakfast at the Club as well. They provided drinks and light snacks throughout the day which was really worth the money. Then they provided cocktails at night. For the first two nights, my daughter fell asleep in the early evening so we had to cancel our dinner reservations. The food at the Club was sufficient that my husband and I did not really feel the need to order room service.There is a large department store next door (Daimaru) with food stalls and is connected to the Tokyo terminal. Would be easy to buy food and eat at your hotel - cheaper option. We did try the lobby lounge at the hotel for lunch once and the food was very good.The room is excellent - spacious with a very big bathroom. As mentioned by others, the thing that sets Shangrila apart is the service. Their staff are so well trained and engaging that you really feel taken care of. They will really try and do anything for you. All in all, this is an excellent hotel, wonderful service and perfect location.

The combination ala carte/buffet breakfast is extremely high quality. I ordered the eggs benedict royale, it was topped with caviar, a first for me.

We went there around 11am to check-in but the guy(forgot to get his name) front desk officer told us that check-in time is 3pm and there is no available room yet. So we told him that if we would to store our luggage and we will just come back after having our lunch. Then Mr. Front desk told us that there's ONE ROOM AVAILABLE 10sq.m. bigger than what we booked but there's an additional fee of ¥10,000. We told him thank you but ¥10,000 is to much we will be back at 3pm. And again Mr.Front desk officer told us that there's ONE ROOM AVAILABLE same of the room we booked but its a corner room so the view is much more nice but we have to add ¥5,000. We told him that no thank you, we are not planning to upgrade our room . And the next thing is Mr.Front desk told us that ""Oh! your room is just now available"" will a little acting. He told us that we can now check-in in our room.Very disappointing, we spend around 20-30 min to Mr.Front desk's offer to upgrade the room. And when he noticed we have no plan of upgrading, that's the time he gave the room to us. This is the what we encounter from Shangri-la Hotel makati, shangri-la edsa and shangri-la mactan, They want you to upgrade your room to get the additional fee, same tactics with Sofitel hotel. This is no 5 star hotel, what a poor service. My wife got emotional and upset her tears kept falling, this like an fraud ""詐欺"".Mr.Front desk was trying to fool us to upgrade our room because there's a no room available but there is a lot available. Mr. Front desk noticed my wife was in tears and told him what we felt about checking-in and specially it was our anniversary. He immediately apologize and sent 2pcs bananas and 3 oranges for the incident and for our anniversary.Well, what I can say is:1. a platter of fruits is complementary in a 5 star hotel not for a special occasion or for apologizing.2. Most 5 star hotel offers a free upgrade not. And if there's fee a 5 star hotel will not pestering you to upgrade.3. If you need/want a newspaper you have to get it with yourself here in the elevator. It's a D.I.Y. Do It Yourself 4.The big difference between a 3,4 and 5 star Hotel is SERVICE. But people still try to stay in a 5 star hotel even its expensive just to experience the best service.5.

Second, it is one of the newer comers to town and it shows in every positive way. Amazing rooms and great views. Local friends cautioned that the high floors will experience more volatility in a tremor than other hotels but I am not sure any one building is better than another in that regard. Finally the service goes beyond the already high local standards. Example: my Rimowa suitcase was damaged as I arrived.

On the website, the hotel stated that they could accommodate two children in the room by stating this request on the booking form. Shortly after I received an email stating that their policy on this had changed but that they would accommodate me on this occassion. A subsequent email requested an extra charge for my 12 year old son. I was very surprised on arrival to be told that I could have the two boys in the room but there could only be one extra bed. I requested an upgrade to a larger room to have two beds, or failing that I requested our booking be changed to adjoining rooms (for which I was willing to pay extra) but was told briefly that this wasn't possible. Basically, it all seemed to be my problem.Fortunately the room was rather large and had an extra couch, so my son slept there which was satisfactory but disappointing.Apart from this, I would recommend this hotel for its location, amenities and services (apart from the reservation misunderstanding). The position next to Tokyo station was brilliant, partly for access to sights by tokyo rail but also because everything was available at Tokyo station from specialist ramen to toys to starbucks. The 'meet and greet' service was a boon, as it would have been a bewildering trip through the station from the Narita Express when we first arrived.I can't comment on the restaurants as they have a children over 6 only policy so we couldn't go. The breakfast was a bit over the top even for a buffet but just next door at the Tekko building there was an excellent newly opened Sarabeth's.The room was lovely, with nice views over Tokyo.

It was late when we got in and we were immediately seated in the lounge where we could enjoy the canapés and cocktails while they checked us in.

The palace is also within walking distance and the fish market is a short taxi ride away (make sure and leave the hotel by 4:30am for this).

The hotel is situated in a tower nearby, on the 28th floor (and on). The hotel is missing the standard grand entrance you would expect from such a hotel, the driveway, the huge doors, spacious lobby etc but again it is just Tokyo style as others luxury properties have it this way, too. Its style is classic and formal.The rooms have great views, especially the ones with the Tokyo Skytree view. They are spacious, refined and really really clean. The best part is the huge comfy bed, the tub with the room view and the amenities. Also, the housekeeping staff is very polite and the service center staff + waiters are very helpful and eager to provide a great service.I stayed there two times now and the thing I liked most every time was the breakfast from the Italian restaurant located near the lobby. I tried a lot of things like ricotta pancakes, the french toast, the eggs Benedict (classic ones), fruit, danish pastry .... and I cannot say what I liked more. If I had to choose I would definitely recommend going for the different variations of the poached eggs and the Chef's signature pancakes and trench toast.","Bale, Croatia","MeneghettiWineHotel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bale, Croatia</strong>",20,5.0

Upon check in, i felt very welcome as they greeted me with a ""welcome back"" and all went in very smoothly, they even mentioned that I have a package that was delivered to them already inside the room.Upon entering the room, the bed was all set up and turned down since we arrived late in the evening, they even provided a teddy bear android size slippers for my children. A welcome treat is also there, a train bread with jelly beans and candies for the kids. The room as always is very spacious and clean, it was like back when i came in last March and it is how I remembered it but this time with the view of the Tokyo Sky Tree. All toiletries are available with a special kit for the kids as well. Breakfast was served at Piacere, it is a part sit down/part buffet type of breakfast. Order whatever in the menu as you like and get some cold cuts, fresh fruits and salad as well as freshly squeeze juices in the buffet table. I love the french toast as well as the eggs benedict. I love the location of Shangri-la as it is just adjacent the Tokyo Station, with loads of restaurants to choose from and a Daimaru Department store inside it. It is also centrally located with multiple train and subway lines which makes it easy to go around Tokyo but it take time to get use the directions since the station is huge.I love this hotel because it takes good care of you during your stay, and even had some surprises for my kids during our arrival.

The hotel itself is on top of an office building so starts at the 28th floor so there was not a bad view. The service was totally beyond anything we have ever experienced. Small example, we wanted to catch a train on our first day and a staff member escorted us to the station, helped us buy a ticket and took us to the actual platform - all with a smile! Exceptional. Also definitely recommend upgrading to the Horizon Club. Top floor of the hotel and great place for breakfast and a cocktail before dinner. Thank you so much Shangri-la Tokyo.

I deliberately chose to stay in Shangri-La Tokyo for 4 days to rest and recover as I have been amazed by the Shangri-La experience in Asia. When I arrived by my own car, the bell boy at basement 1 was very helpful in helping with our luggage and directing me to the carpark. In fact the bell boy went out of the arrival lobby to the carpark entrance directing to B2, just to make sure I do not missed it. Well done! The concierge on level 1 and basement 1 were always very warm, very Shangri-La. My check-in at the front desk was received warmly. Beyond that, the front desk appeared busy, indifferent, staff looking at their computer screens (even when there's no one checking in). Perhaps I am not in my suit, but again why should I? I was on vacation. And I was dressed in lesser quality in another Shangri-La hotels such as Philippines and Singapore. But I never felt anything like this before. Bigotry because I am of a particular race? I travelled extensively in Japan for the past 10 years. The only time I had such experience was with a Swiss competitor hotel in Osaka. I never use that chain since. Since all guests will bypass the front desk when the they leave or enter the hotel, this must be rectified. This is not the typical Shangri-La experience.Had 3 rooms on the 34th floor facing the Imperial palace which offered you glimpses of the castles. You do have unrestricted space of about 1 km before you hit the neighbouring office towers. You will have a good view of the JR station if you love trains.My room was perfect. Tip top conditions, luxurious feel, nicely placed sofa for you to enjoy the view. Absolutely clean. Wow. You will have enough amenities to overwhelm you. You have a box of electronic cables in a box to match any gadgets you have. And stable wifi. I could not find a fault with the room. The only one AFTER looking around for 4 days - my downlight at the basin lacked a lens cover. Can you imagine that?I travelled with 2 boys. They are a mess. The housekeeping ensured that they are not a problem. Always neat and tidy everyday. You do have the convenience of living beside a JR, ie the trains, shopping and restaurants. My wife made an interesting remark - it is all very upmarket. If you want a more down to earth feel, you may have to travel out perhaps. I would love to give this hotel a 5 star rating, for its excellent room and almost perfect Shangri-La experience.

On arravil by train from Narita airport, we where met at the train platform(after a phonecall from the aiport with our arrival time and our carriage number) by a lovely lady whom guided us through the cazy/mad looking, first impression of Tokyo Station. At the arrival of the hotel, we where guided to our room for checkin, what was great after a 18 our flight! The room was spacious and had a great view on the railway tracks of Tokyo Station, which we liked. The staff of the hotel is great, and they recognize you when you return back after sightseeing Tokyo, they are all very helpfull! So thank you for feeling welcome!! There where two small problems we had during our stay, wich one was handled well, and one was disappointing. One day after a long day sightseeing we went for the pool, before you enter the pool you have to wear bathing hats( not sure if there another word for it) what is fine if that's the rule. After entering the pool there was one Asian man swimming who i think he thought it was his private pool, he made the most disgusting noises, and spit it out at the end of every swimming lane. We didn't wanted to be in that pool for any moment longer, and talked to the staff, they where on ""our"" side with on this matter, but that was it. It totaly ruined our day, and had hoped for some kind of response, but am sorry to say, there wasn't anything, not even on the next day we got to the pool. One day we have a private guided who showed us her side of Tokyo, and we invited her back to our hotel for a coffee in the lounge, the lounge was fully booked with guests outside the hotel for afternoon tea, so no room in house residents. They told us go to the restaurant( great place where we had great breakfasts each morning) when we got there, they told us also no, can't have any coffee here. That's when i got mad, it's strange that when you big money to stay here, you even can't have a drink with a guest. That' s when the manager came in, and told us that we could have a drink or two. He was very friendly and understanding, and at the end we didn't paid for the drinks, but that's wasn't what we wanted, just want to have a drink without the hassle. Next time we come to Tokyo/Japan, im a sure we will stay here again. The Shangri-La is located almost above the Tokyo Station, which is a city on its own. With a large department store called Daimaru, if you like food like us, you have to visit this store. You can also find great cheap restaurants withnin Tokyo station, and you won't a lot of western tourists, and ordering is sometimes a challenge, but that is one thing we like about exploring the world.

So you have incredibly easy access to transport as well a large shopping mall underground and lots of great and cheap places to eat. You can also walk conveniently to Nihimbashi.

It is a simple trip via NEX train from Narita - apparently the hotel will send staff to meet you trackside if you request it in advance. The hotel is located at the top of an office building, but has a ground floor entrance staffed by a concierge who will show you up the elevator to the lobby. The views are beautiful but, depending on the room, landmarks such as Mt. Fuji might be obscured by other skyscrapers.The property is opulent, befitting a Shangri-La. Nespresso machine, Japanese teas, and bottled water were complimentary. The mini-bar was stocked with Hibiki 17-year and Yamazaki 12-year whiskeys for under Y1,500 ($15), which was a nice treat and cheaper than at a bar in the US. I dined in the Piacere restaurant, in the bar/tapas area, and had excellent ham and salami sliced from the leg jamon-style. I also tried the room service - BBQ ribs from the Western menu - but they were not memorable.The good-sized room had a soft bed as well as two each of hard/thin and thick/soft down pillows to mix and match as desired. There was a banquette-type couch by the window perfect for relaxing and taking in the view after a long day. The desk has an abundance of power outlets (including powered USB) and wifi is free throughout the property. Also provided is a very Japanese stationery kit which included not only paper and pencil, but three colors of highlighter, a metal pencil sharpener, and a rubber eraser. The closet space was more than adequate for my trip but less than other high-end hotels.The bathroom was appointed with L'Occitane bath products and a Toto Washlet toilet with numerous adjustable settings if you're in to being perfectly clean. My room had only a tub and not a separate shower, but it was fully handicapped-accessible. The fitness center had free weights (in kg not lbs, so use Google on your smartphone to convert), strength machines, treadmills, and an exercise bicycle, as well as a three-lane lap pool. Chilled bottled water, headphones, towels, and apples and bananas are provided. I was jet-lagged so was in the gym at about 5am each day, and the soundtrack of early-2000s hip-hop (e.g. DMX) really got me going and provoked an unexpected sense of nostalgia, haha. The locker room area is one of the best I've seen in a hotel - including not only a sauna and hot tub, but also a rainfall/steam shower that sends water cascading down from a shower head about 10 feet in the air - it felt like a luxurious, warm torrential downpour. The shower also had large pump-action bottles of body wash, shampoo, and conditioner, which is way better than tiny bottles with screw caps.

I chose this hotel because it is located next to my office. It is also conveniently located at Tokyo Station. So it is extremely convenient if you need to travel out of Tokyo on the Shinkansen. Lots of eating places and shopping located at Tokyo Station.The service here is excellent. Always treated with a smile whenever I encounter a service staff. And most importantly, they all speak good English which makes communication a breeze. This is so rare in Japan.My room was a corner room on level 33. It is beautiful and has a large window facing opp the bed and gives a few as far as Tokyo Sky Tree. There is also a large window next to the bath tub which allows one to soak in the tub and admire the city view at the same time. The bathroom is huge, especially the shower area. The room is equipped with a nespresso machine too. My king size bed was especially comfortable. I slept well from the first night.Breakfast is at the Italian restaurant. You choose a main from the menu and the rest is buffet. Selection is not large, but I like the idea of a make yo order breakfast.

First of all, every staff member whom I encountered (and there were many) were unfailingly pleasant and polite.The room was massive with every amenity you would want and the view was extraordinary - no need to fork out for the Tokyo Sky Tree if you are staying here!The service in the bar was efficient and unobtrusive.The first problem I encountered was at check-in where I was told that there were no rooms available matching the type that I requested when I booked online many months ago. This is not satisfactory, for when you pay an awful lot of (your own) money for a room you expect to get that type of room - or at least be informed when you book online that there are none.The second annoyance was with breakfast. The charging is poorly explained, for the breakfast menu in the restaurant differs from the in-room dining one. A continental breakfast in your room costs 2,600 yen, but the same breakfast in the restaurant with the addition of an egg dish, costs 4,400 yen. I got the shock of my life when I got the bill. This situation needs to be better laid-out, both in the room directory and outside the restaurant.The location of the hotel is exceptionally convenient right on top of Tokyo Station. If you plan on doing a lot of walking, bring extra thick socks and well-worn-in shoes.I would stay here again, but only after I phoned the hotel beforehand to make sure that the room I booked and paid for was the one I will actually get.","Canberra, Australia","Nick2741</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",23,4.0

We found the best rate was through booking directly with the hotel. The king size bed was huge and comfortable. The room was spacious even with the rollaway bed. Great bathroom. Good lighting. Spectacular views. Free wifi. Useful items that I’ve never seen in a hotel room before including a torch, and bathroom scales (which we used to weigh our luggage after shopping). Beautiful L’Occitane bath products.Excellent location right above Tokyo Station. If you are arriving by train, definitely pre-book the complementary meet and greet and then email the Shangri La from the train with details of your car number. Tokyo Station is huge and easy to get lost for the first time. The Shangri La is closest to the Yaesu North exit - walk past Starbucks, then out of the building and turn right at the Bellmart (convenience store) and you should be able to see it just opposite the Beer CaféAsk for a non-smoking room if that is important to you. Our room had no smoke smell.While we were right above Tokyo Station, we mostly used the Nihombashi Metro station for getting between the hotel and most places in Tokyo. Nihombashi Exit A3 is closest to the Shangri La (about 1 block away). Otemachi metro station is also very close.This is one of the few hotels in Tokyo that doesn’t have restrictions on when children can use the swimming pool or a minimum age. You must wear a swimming cap. The pool is open from 6:30am-10pm. Towels, water, fruit, and slippers are available – as well as a beautiful warm shower. The staff were excellent with our son. The adjacent gym is open 24 hours.Complimentary bottles of water are provided in your room on arrival, each day, and each night at turn down. If you need more water, you can ask at the pool or at the bell desk near the exit. They often offer a bottle of cold or room temperature water as you leave for the day.Room Service and food at the Lobby Lounge is exceptional and the prices of room service were not as expensive as I was expecting. The Chinese Fried Rice is delicious and the Ceasar Salad was also fantastic. There is a good children’s menu including vegies sticks, mini burgers, fries, fried rice with chicken skewers. All is tasty, arrives hot due to the clever under-table heated compartment, takes around 30 minutes from the time you order, and is beautifully presented.There are heaps of dining options close by. The 12th floor of Daimaru has several restaurants with English menus. There are also many restaurants in “Kitchen Street” within Tokyo Station but few had English menus. We enjoyed our meal at the Master’s Dream just near the Shangri La. Diamaru has a grocery store in the basement. There is Bellmart at the entrance to Tokyo Station, and a Seven Eleven on Yaesu Street. We asked to have the mini-bar removed from our fridge so that we could keep a few things such as yoghurt and fruit.We were on the 35th floor and had a view out to Disneyland and could watch the Disney fireworks at 8:30pm each night. A great way to end the day, even though the fireworks are a long way off. We also had an excellent view of SkyTree.Daimaru is a huge department store next door to the Shangri La. It also has Tokyu Hands. I had more fun shopping for souvenirs and children’s gifts in the lower floor of Tokyo Station. Look for ‘First Avenue’ signs, or go down the stairs next to Starbucks. You’ll find stores for Lego, Hello Kitty, Pokemon, Tomica Toy Cars, Tamagotchi and much more.The staff at the Shangri La are all friendly and happy to help guests in any way they can.

The lady who checked us in even provided us with some tourist information (as it is in my Golden Circle setting that I travel for leisure). The experience was personal and the staff obliging. We dined at various restaurants during our stay. Piacere, for breakfast, was outstanding. They serve breakfast in a great combination style between a buffet and an a la carte menu. The food was fresh, and the views over Tokyo are picturesque from the 28th floor. It is furnished to a very high standard and is a very enjoyable place to visit. I also ordered room service and visited the Lobby Lounge, both of which were just as excellent.

Nadaman serves great traditional Japanese food and in addition to the regulation seating, it has a teppanyaki room that can seat 6-8 people and sushi bar. Piacere serves great a breakfast buffet, afternoon tea, and Italian fare. We love the little origami crane accompanying the room service. Great attention to detail on everything.

The hub of the great transportation system takes you to the whole city and the entire country.

The number of missteps can be counted on one hand and this from 7+ stays.I love that Shangri-la Tokyo is a full service hotel with a proper entrance, even though it shared office space and the lobby isn't on the ground floor. The kind door people welcome you and bow 90 degrees as your elevator closes. That is rare in the world (even in Japan and North Asia) and the first sign that Shangri-la puts you on a pedestal as a guest. They do this for everyone, not just the suited men or Birkin carrying women too.Staff take off their shoes when entering your room and stoop down when speaking to you. They're really the best when it comes to service. A special shoutout goes to the Horizon Club staff and the indefatigable, tireless Ms. Mizukoshi. She's a miracle worker.Plush. Everything there is so plush from Shang the mascot bear to the carpets and the bedding. It's a sign of true luxury and no expenses spared for one of their flagship properties. Breakfast at Piacere is consistently good. You have a choice between their Western short menu and the buffet spread, Japanese or Chinese set and the fresh spread. The Chinese dim sum set is probably one of the worst. Nutritionally devoid and not really tasty. This might come from the fact that they have no Chinese restaurant in-house unlike Mandarin Oriental across the freeway.Spa: One of the best in the city. No city outer views but a calming oasis in a city of bustle. I don't miss seeing the urban jungle when I spa at the CHI spa.This is always one of my Tokyo homes away from homes.

Everything about the Shangri-La Tokyo is exceptional. The executive suite provides a beautiful and large space, with great bathroom facilities, and work space where everything works perfectly, and every possible wire or plug is made available to connect. Every staff interaction, bar none, is handled in the most professional and friendly manner—from the restaurants to the meet and greet escort at the train station. Incidentally, the latter is a terrific amenity, especially if you are not too familiar with the station or city. A friendly face greets you at the train platform and escorts you through the maze of corridors and gates to the hotel lobby (and same on the way out). The Horizon Club (executive lounge) staff is also great—booking tickets, arranging reservations—all handled efficiently and professionally. I am generally partial to the Shangri-La hotels—when I find them in a given city, they deliver a consistent level of excellence. This particular location probably outdoes all of them. The traditional Japanese restaurant features the highest quality sushi and sashimi. Breakfast is served at the Italian restaurants, and features excellent variety for breakfast (the lobster eggs benedict is outstanding). The only disappointment was that this Shangri-La did not include a Cheng Palace Chinese restaurant (like the ones in Kowloon and Paris).

Also, the astounding number of shops and eateries within walking distance gave me so many shopping and dining options. Last but not least, the train from the airport runs right into this station; (2) Their complimentary ""Meet and Greet"" service, which greeted me when I got off the trains from the airport and another city, as well as escorted me to the trains to the airport and another city, eliminated the complication of navigating the maze-like Tokyo Station; (3) Their complimentary wifi service was really fast for a hotel, and I achieved download speeds of around 12Mbps; (5) Their concierge was very good at assisting me in organizing various aspects of my trip, especially reservations at hard-to-book Michelin-starred restaurants; (4) Their room was spacious and comfortable, with superb amenities all around; and (5) Their service all around was truly excellent.The only glitch I experienced was the HDMI port connecting the desk to the TV malfunctioned. And yes, the desk in the room had all sorts of TV and telecommunication ports.By the way, unless you enjoy the bird's eye view of the train station, which I did, I would advise against paying up for the view of the Imperial Palace, as the line of sight to this attraction is heavily obstructed by buildings in between.

We actually had breakfast here only once, we afterwards had breakfast at the Horizon Lounge (as we are Golden Circle members ). Here the options for breakfast were plenty as well, buffet and a la carte. Mentioning the Horizon Lounge I need to say that for the Happy Hour (between 5.30 pm and 8.00 pm every day) the appetizers & amuse bouche choices were rather limited, compared to other Shangri-la Horizon Clubs. Also, sorry to say but the staff at the Horizon Lounge Tokyo, although extremely polite, lacked friendliness and warmth.Very prompt housekeeping and turndown service, all maids spoke English.Nice gym (although a bit small and got cramped in the morning hours). Nice swimming pool.I was extremely impressed with the spa, the therapist was extremely skilled, extremely polite, the spa atmosphere very nice, probably among the best spas I have ever been to.Fast and free wi-fi.The view from our room was a nice one, over the Tokyo skyline. Hotel is extremely well soundproofed and everything is of the best quality and finished to a very high standard and with an eye for details that is truly impressive.The hotel is situated in the heart of the business district, not far from some good shopping areas and less than 5 minutes walk from the Tokyo Train Station, where you can take the Narita Express Train or a Shinkansen line.On our departure the hotel gave us an escort to the train station, to show us the exact way to the Nozomi Line, as the Tokyo station is quite big and you could easily get lost.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","onceisnotenough30</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",233,5.0

Anywhere you stay will have a standard of comfort, class and quality that will run across all levels. From the capsule hotels to the extremely luxurious, you are more than guaranteed that your service and the quality of stay will be next to perfect.The Tokyo Shangri-La is no exception. After the 46 minute ride from Narita to Tokyo station, a mere 5 minute walk will bring you to your hotel. Now I don't normally take the luxury route in Tokyo, however this time, travelling with 6 other people, a modicum of comfort and space was required. With, plush beds, a large bathrooms with rain shower and bath, wide sweeping widows and all the amenities that you can think of, the Shangri-La has it all. Now, true to the nature of Japan, the rooms aren't huge, but they do make excellent use of the space, but that is a small sacrifice for what you get. With the great location and the excellent service. There is a small pool and even smaller Gym, but there is enough to kinda get your heart rate pumping but I am sure walking around the city will give you just as much exercise. But if you're in Japan, you're not there to sleep, you're there to go about the city and with Tokyo station being a hub for a number of Metro and Railway lines, you can get to anywhere in the City, plus the rest of Japan is within grasp as the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) stations are housed below you also.Shangri-La hotels are always known for their attention to detail and when you throw in Japanese hospitality into the mix, you are guaranteed you're in for a treat. The Shangri-La is on the high side in the pricing scale however, it's worth it. If you though are looking for something on the more reasonable side, The Yaesu Terminal Hotel is across the street. And it's excellent.

Thankfully, we changed our travel arrangements to stay at the Shangri-La in Tokyo for longer - what a good move that was!Two Bell Boys (actually one of them was a girl!) met us at the train platform when we alighted, and escorted us, whilst wheeling our suitcases, to the hotel. Before they took their leave, they introduced us to a 'very nice Concierge lady', who then escorted us to our room. Upon our arrival, the 'very nice Concierge lady' checked us in - in our room!!! - Most impressive!!! (Food for thought... why can't every 5 star hotel do this?)Ok, so once ensconced in our 'more than adequate' abode, one checks out the amenities/nice touches - of which they were an abundance!

However, I'd argue that the hotel's location can be good or bad, depending on what you do and I'm writing from a tourist perspective. Shangri-La Tokyo's location is great if the train plays an essential part of your itinerary, (e.g. side trip to Kanazawa) as it's right next to the JR Tokyo Station. Yet, the location is definitely not as good as Peninsula's (quite bad if you ask me) if shopping and fine dining is on top of your as Shangri-La is at least a 20 minute walk from the Ginza Mitsukoshi/Wako intersection. Service overall is excellent and I can't find anything wrong with it. Yet, when compared to The Peninsula which I've stayed a number of times in previous trips, the service at Shangri-La feels a bit mechanical and cold. Concierge is pretty good, but I dare to suggest that The Peninsula's is better by being more human, more patient and more passionate towards figuring the guest's needs.

We arrived in Tokyo early afternoon. After a 13 hour flight, and this being our first time in Tokyo, we had booked a hotel car to pick us up. I am so glad we did, it was the perfect start to our amazing trip.We arrived at hotel, was immediately checked into our room by a very friendly Horizon Club host - I am sorry, I would have loved to mention her name here, but I am afraid that I have forgot. During our 3 night stay, all staff at Horizon Club were nothing short of excellent - they did everything to ensure that we had a wonderful stay. Maps, train schedules, even a guide to the Shinkansen train station who walked us to the train when it was time for us to continue our Japan trip. The room was very, very nice - we had a corner room with plenty of space for us - two adults, one teen daughter. Big windows with great views to Sky Tree (and some construction, but that did not bother us). Lovely decor and bathroom with big shower/tub with equally great views. Lovely bath amenities from L'Occitaine and almost everything else you need - toothbrush, combs, razors - and we also loved that every night, hotel pyjamas was laid out on our beds. The room amenities were great, too - ironing board, tea/coffee, robes and slippers. We loved the pool area - especially candlelit at night with all the city lights. As mentioned we had access to the Horizon Club, which was wonderful. Delicious breakfast, afternoon tea, drinks and canapes. We were told that the breakfast selection was a bit larger at one of the restaurants, but we felt that we had plenty of choice at the Club and just went there every morning. It was a great place to go for a drink before heading out for dinner. And some nights, we even returned for a nightcab before going to bed. Comfy furniture and great views of Tokyo. And, as said, helpful staff.We were truly impressed with the Shangri-La and the level of service provided here and will not hesitate to come back. On our last leg of our Japan trip, we stayed at Peninsula (find my review in my profile), but Shangri-La is many levels above Peninsula in terms of rooms, pool area, dining options and staff. We actually tried to check out of Peninsula and book another stay at Shangri-La again for the last couple of days of our trip as it is so much better, but unfortunately they were sold out… no doubt that on future trips to Tokyo (of which we hope there will be many, as we have fallen in love with this wonderful city) we will book Shangri-La again.","Copenhagen, Denmark","katrineCPH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Copenhagen, Denmark</strong>",228,5.0

The only downside is it is a bit of a walk to restaurants and other shops - excluding Tokyo station which is huge.","Melbourne, Australia","John T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",21,5.0

This is a must if you are arriving by train.Check in was efficient, yet cold. Seated in the Horizon Club, there was none of the usually ""welcome back"" chitchat we have come to love at Shangri-La Hong Kong and Singapore... We were simply handed our keys and shown to our room. A nice welcome touch was the birthday cake they bought to our room for my husband.The room itself was lovely... A plush corner suite with sweeping views over the train station and city. The bathroom is always a highlight at the Shangri-La.Sadly, we found the Horizon Club to be small and inadequate for such a large hotel. The drinks selection was very poor... Not even sake on offer.

The reception swiped my credit card and immediately after it I received my room key card. The room is situated almost at the side of the famous Tokyo railway central station. A great view to the station and City Central. The noise from the station is hardly heard from the room on 32rd floor. In Shangri La there are a number of top notch restaurants: western style, Japanese and oriental. For the breakfast, a variety of menu are available. Nadaman Japanese restaurant is a great choice for lunch or dinner.For a shopping, it is just in the next block. A big shopping mall called Daimaru Tokyo.Distances to The Imperial Palace or Shinjuku business district are reachable by private taxi, buses or by train.The location of Shangri La Hotel is so strategic.

The location right near Tokyo Station was extremely convenient. The service was strong. And the rooms were nice enough for vacation but serviceable enough for business (without being corporate). I spent another few nights at the Grand Hyatt and found it definitely overly corporate and lacking in character by comparison. Definitely recommend the Shangri La over the Grand Hyatt. I also considered staying at The Palace. Turns out that while I'm sure it's gorgeous inside, it isn't located in an area that's nearly as walkable as the Shangri La. I'm a city dweller and really value a pedestrian experience when I visit cities. So as nice as I'm sure The Palace is, I was glad I chose the Shangri La for its much more walkable location.Ginza is a few minutes away from the hotel as is Tokyo Station. The Muji flagshi, the major department stores, Sukiyabashi Jiro, and many other notable places are within a mile or so walking distance. You can also hop a train to Kyoto or nearly anywhere from Tokyo Station a few steps away. And of course there are smaller izakaya and 7/11s nearby for whatever you may need.The Shangri La rooms are plush and Japanese in decoration. Room color and linens are sumptuous and very inviting. There's a control panel near the bed for various lighting vignettes and for bringing the window shades up and down. Room service includes turndown service. Because the rooms are located in a tall office tower, all of the views are stunning.The wifi didn't work in our room, but the front desk quickly delivered a portable hot spot. We ended up charging it every day and toting it around Tokyo with us in addition to using it in the room. Free wifi while we walked the city? Sure, why not.I forget which room we booked, but the bathroom was beautiful. There was a large vanity and washroom in one area and then an attached standing shower and bathtub in the next. The bathtub was next to a floor to ceiling window which meant you could soak and daydream at the same time. I also noticed that the floor was heated in the standing shower. Nice touch.The fitness area is small but the attached pool is quite sizeable. It's mildly heated and equipped with kickboards, floaties, and refreshing glasses of lemon water. Swim caps are required but provided. You can also borrow goggles for swimming laps. There is enough room for a few people to swim laps and others to bob around happily.The hotel is set back from the road and a bit hard to find, but this means you feel more like you're staying in a nice condo versus a commercial establishment.The only other thing I would say is that the photos of the hotel's common spaces tend to exaggerate its size. The common spaces (primarily the lobby, hotel bar, restaurant) aren't as enormous as the photos seem. This is actually a good thing in that the place doesn't have the usual oversized lobby feel that major hotels have. (I remember staying at the Shangri La in Bangkok and feeling like it was a bit of a guest factory due to the size.) So the Shangri La Tokyo feels more intimate. You can get from the street to your room without going through any towering atriums or endless carpeted lobbies, just a few small elevator banks and nicely appointed seating areas (though it is still a walk!).I highly recommend staying a few days here if you're in need of convenience and respite in Tokyo. The Shangri La made our stay really enjoyable.","New York City, New York","erinpettigrew</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",30,5.0

We took a corner room on a high club floor (36th story) which offered plenty of space for a family of 4 and had decent views. The room was well appointed and laid out nicely. I found the “club Lounge” (located one floor above us on the 37th story) as a nice plus for extra attention and a place to enjoy snacks/meals in relative peace. Breakfast is fresh and nicely presented. The club level staff (the only ones I ever really dealt with other than bell staff) were always courteous, helpful and went out of their way. The common areas are nice enough but I found they lacked any type of grandeur and opulence over being classic functional. I did find that in-room greeting amenities weren’t overly personalized. While they had stuffed animals and a cake train for the kids (a very nice touch), and a couple cookies with chocolate batons for the adults, there was no card recognizing that this was an anniversary trip versus a “standard” card for “golden Circle” members stating “Welcome Back” (never mind that this was my first stay in a Shangri-La and I had only joined the “Golden Circle” club when booking this reservation. Lol).  Overall….. I wouldn’t have a problem staying at Shangri-La again nor would I have a problem suggesting it to others. The personalized service is (for the most part) there. The rooms are spacious and well done. Breakfast was about the best out of the 3 properties we stayed at while visiting Tokyo. While I think Shangri-la is a bit over 4 circles, the previously mentioned lack of grandeur and a few niggles keeps me from giving it a straight 5. In-Depth Review…2 Adults (40’s), 2 Children (girls ages 3 & 7). Travelling for leisure as a wedding anniversary trip.Check in…. I emailed ahead of our departure from the hotel we were currently staying in and we arrived by Taxi. Our luggage was taken/tagged and we were escorted by the bellman up to the Club Lounge for Check-in. After being seated in the lounge, drink orders were taken and a member of the lounge staff came over for a personalized check-in. As we had taken the pre-paid rate, a receipt was given for such. Our passports were checked and the credit card was taken for any “incidentals” (mini-bar, restaurants, spa, etc.). We were then shown down to our room by the same staff member. Painless, easy, personalized, ProfessionalBed Room/Living Room… Luggage was in our room upon arrival. We had a corner room. While the smallest room of the hotels we stayed in while visiting Tokyo, it was still a decent enough size (about 63m2) to accommodate our party of 4. This was the only property out of 3 to have the living room and bedroom areas together versus in separated areas (aka jr. suite style) which helped the room appear larger, spacious, and open. 1 King size bed, 2 nightstands, an L shaped couch next to the window, and a desk/table. Large flat screen TV on wall. We had an extra bed installed for the children which fit nicely below the tv/entertainment area and didn’t interfere with the flow of the room (i.e. we never felt that the room was crowded due to having the extra bed). Amenities were in the room upon arrival. These included a cake train for the kids and cookies for the adults. There was also a small platter of 3 fruits alongside the previously mentioned “welcome back” card. 2 stuffed bears were on the bed for the 2 kids. Overall a pretty professional 1st impression that seemed to give consideration to all guests in the room (the children are often forgotten).Nespresso machine is provided along with a few capsules (although no explanation was provided as to what the different capsules were). Mini bar seemed to have a good selection of drinks. One night they even laid out the ingredients and provided us with an “in-room drink recipe pamphlet”. We don’t drink but I still found it a neat touch and a bit original compared to what I’ve seen at other properties. Not sure as to the food selection to be honest. Bathroom…. Nice large tub next to the window. Separate Rain shower. Usual Japanese “automatic” toilet. Large Single sink. . Nicely decorated and spaciousBulgari soaps, shower gels, etc. All the amenities you would probably expect and perhaps need (razors, toothbrushes, cotton swabs, sewing kit, etc.). They even provided a little kit in a nice bag as a gift for my wife (something to do with makeup removal). While my skin isn’t usually sensitive, the shave cream burned my face for about 20 minutes after I applied it. Adult robes and slippers were in place, but I needed to call for the kids. Although this was easily fixed with a phone call… it was still a slight miss. Plenty of towels were provided and refreshed as needed. I don’t remember ever running out.One issue is that the shower has see-through glass doors… so… anytime someone else needs to use the toilet, sink, mirror, or bath, there is no privacy. I’m not overly squeamish as to nudity… but it’s almost like being in a zoo exhibit. Of course there are no doors on the bath either so perhaps I’m just being overly pickyClub Lounge….I myself found club level to be worth the extra cost and would opt for it again in the future. I enjoy Club Level service & lounges and Shangri-La was no different. While I thought the lounge was a bit on the smaller side and dark (use of dark wood in tighter quarters and lack of sunlight), it was still nicely done overall. I’m a bit up in the air as to their use of couches in the lounge. They take up a lot of space and while they are nice for a drink, they aren’t overly ideal for eating.The lounge staff were all polite and professional with a friendly greeting and quick service. Very attentive. My 3 year old was quite playful and the staff took their time to play with her and were patient with her following them around the place. On our arrival, they had run out of watermelon on the buffet. While I’m sure they were going to refill it anyways, one of the staff (the manager I believe) went in back and made the 3yo a personal plate full of watermelon. One night the 3 year old fell asleep early and upon request the staff made her a small plate of food and delivered it to the room for her to eat later.My 7 year old wanted a massage and the lounge manager went out of her way to coordinate with the spa manager in order to allow her to do so. My 7 year old was so impressed overall with the lounge manager that she insisted on buying her a box of chocolates (first time that’s ever happened).Train tickets to Narita were arranged by Club Lounge staff,Breakfast is nice. Eggs, waffles, pancakes and the Japanese breakfast are ordered off the menu (try the eggs Benedict royale with lobster & caviar. So good that my wife and I greedily ordered 2 each morning). Meanwhile… the buffet contains the usual variety of pastries, fresh fruits, cold cuts, local cheeses, salad, etc. They also do a nice job of throwing in a few extra little specialty dishes (i.e. verines, etc.).  Although a bit limited at certain times, there was usually a selection of food throughout the day. We had “dinner” there once when the main dishes were shrimp and duck. Also nice for a quick coke, juice, or coffee (take away coffee is available). No pineapple juice for the kids but I’m sure the fresh squeezed orange juice was an acceptable substitute.There was a slight mistake as to credits for the spa but as it actually ended up in my favour I can’t really complain. I had originally booked $300 in advanced credit for the spa. They mentioned it would be canceled when I changed to the pre-booked rate. When checking in, they gave me my receipt with a hand written note saying that I had the spa credits. I asked them to verify this as I had been told otherwise… They checked, and while we were out, they left me a note in my room stating that I indeed had spa credit and here’s a spa menu…so…of course we went ahead and used it. When I went to check out, I noticed that they had billed me for the whole thing. Of course I mentioned that I had credit… They then told me that “No, I actually didn’t because of the rate change”. I mentioned that they had said I did & that I even had a note saying so. Either way… They took it off my bill… Although the situation was a bit embarrassing, I would guess that someone on staff made an honest mistake which was corrected in favour of the client (which in my opinion is the way it should be). So again…No real complaints.Spa… We had planned Disney for our last day but ended up too exhausted to really want to do it. I gave my daughter all the information as to crowds and waiting times at Disney and then gave her a choice…Busy day at Disney or a relaxing Spa day (which we had credit for anyways). I’m a bit proud to say that she understood and chose the spa… While we wanted 3 massages of 90 minutes, they only had 1 room available for 60 minutes. I of course bowed out and let my wife and daughter take the slot together. But….. The spa has a policy of 16-17 years old. As I had the lounge manager arrange things, I do hope it wasn’t too big of an issue. A massage is in a private room so it’s not like my daughter would have been running around bothering other clients anyways…….Many properties actually have children’s massages in their Spa Menu. …Happily they were willing to be flexible and allow her in.Either way…They both seemed to enjoy their massages. My daughter was quite happy. My wife usually prefers masseurs over masseuses and wasn’t given a choice but I suppose one takes what is available (or perhaps socially acceptable?). A workout room is available in the spa/pool area. As a tourist I spend enough time walking and carrying my 3 year old to care too much about workout rooms. Pool… The pool accepts children at certain hours (I believe it to be 0900-1800). While allowing my children to swim is a mandatory requirement for me in a hotel (it was actually the reason I cancelled my reservation with Mandarin Oriental), I understand others may want some peace and don’t mind limited hours (too much). Nice enough pool. Medium sized. More practical/utilitarian versus having much ambience. They did have candles set-up in the window but I never saw them lit. View from the pool area was nice enough (but it’s not as if I spend much time looking out the window when I’m playing in the pool with the girlies). The pool was never busy and once we had the whole thing to ourselves.This was the only property we stayed at in Tokyo that had the Jacuzzi and pool in separate areas. Not a huge deal but still inconvenient when you need to keep an eye on kids Kickboards, water peanuts, and kiddie water wings (arm floats) are available poolside. If I remember correctly they offered goggles at the desk. Swim caps were required and provided at the desk (standard in all the other properties I stayed at in Japan as well). Bottled water was set up in the pool area and the spa attendant brought in a pitcher of lemon ice water when we arrived (the pool had been empty upon arrival both times). The normal standard in luxury properties is to lay towels over the poolside lounge chairs (either in advance or when the client arrives on location). This doesn’t seem to be policy at Shangri-La. We don’t do much sitting over swimming so this wasn’t really an issue but it does sort of miss on service/luxury. Housekeeping… For the most part they did a good job of always refreshing the towels, soaps and amenities but we did somehow end up short a roll of toilet paper and a couple soaps on our last day. I just called for the items and they brought them straight up.While water and glasses were provided and refreshed for the adults, they never left any for the kids. I didn’t mention anything, but it would have been a nice touch.Ice is provided at evening turn down.  The beds were done nicely. The kids’ nightclothes were folded and their stuffed animals arranged nicely on the bed. They provided a secondary smaller stuffed bear keychain for the children during our stay. Although they originally provided only 1 for the 2 children, they gave me another one after I left a polite note explaining the situation.Shoe Shine Service... I used this once. I gave them a pair with special leather and special instructions. The shoes came back an hour later nearly perfect. I was impressed with the speed and the quality of the work. They brought the shoes back nicely presented (wrapped in paper and placed in a weaved wooden box). One note… Nobody seems to ever apply edge dressing to the soles (which suffer more than the leather uppers) so I usually carry my own and do it myself.Laundry service….. As a club level guest we had credit for laundry so I had them do a few items for our trip back home. Items were returned nicely presented (wrapped in paper with a scent packet and placed in a weaved wooden box). Slight Service Miss….They wanted full adult price for my daughters’ basic cotton dresses (which are smaller than my cotton dress shirts). When I requested the same thing at the Tokyo Peninsula they actually sent a guy up from the laundry to check things out and quote me a price (which was 1/3 of their listed “dress price….and then they even charged me less than they quoted). Smoking Lounge… This is the only property we stayed at that had a dedicated smoking lounge (there is no smoking allowed on Japanese streets so all hotels have a smoking area). I didn’t use it often but it seemed as if they could pay a bit more attention to clearing/cleaning the ashtrays (especially overnight/early morning). Either way, a dedicated smoking lounge is a plus when compared to having to go to the bar and feeling that you need to order a $20 coffee just for a quick smoke.Location/neighborhood...Right next to the Tokyo train station. This is nice not only for transport but for the variety of restaurants and shops located in the train station (drug store, convenience store, grocery store, starbucks).Also right next door is the high end 10 story Daimaru department store which was nice for a few hours of relaxed shopping on our last day. The restaurants on the 11th and 12th floors are open a bit later (2300) and we ended up having dinner there one night, and dessert another.Other than that, the surrounding neighborhood didn’t really seem to have much to offer other than a few restaurants, a few bars, a few gaming rooms, a few massage parlors. Nothing that really impressed us as something to visit for more than a couple hour stroll. Misc…Banqueting services are available (not used). Room service is available (not used)They have a Japanese restaurant (not used). There’s a bar/lower level lounge on the 27th floor across from reception (not used).Check-Out…. Check-out was handled with the club lounge staff the night before our departure and was simple enough. I had prepaid my room so all I needed was to pay off a bit of a spa tab and the train tickets to the airport that they had arranged for me. As mentioned earlier, there was a bit of a problem with spa credits but they quickly took it off the bill.Departure… We had an early breakfast at 0630. I called to have the luggage brought down at 0715. At 0730 we met staff on the first floor and were walked to our train platform (she even handled our 2 biggest bags). This is certainly a neat feature of the Shangri-La and it certainly helped eliminate the stress of navigating Tokyo station with 5 bags and 2 kids. From my understanding they’ll also meet you at the platform for arrivals.Conclusion… I enjoyed this property as a club level guest. All the bells and whistles are there and not much fine tuning is needed. My big issue is that it lacks the splendor of the other hotels. There is no 2 story entrance hall/lobby with art work, waterfalls, large crystal chandeliers, floral decorations, etc. While everything works quite nicely, aesthetically the public areas of this hotel didn’t wow me and take my breath away. This is of course a personal opinion and others may prefer the more subdued atmosphere offered here. While I might prefer the Ritz Tokyo, I would be more than happy to stay at the Shangri-La again and I would certainly recommend it to others","Lausanne, Switzerland","theswissmister</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lausanne, Switzerland</strong>",284,4.0

The ""imperial-palace"" view side is better and has a nice view of the train station. The station is far below so no noise issues. A word of caution. The hotel entrance is a little hard to find.

Throughout the 1 week I stayed there, I found the location extremely convenient, service unobtrusive but caring and efficient.Having arrived in Tokyo right in the middle of Sakura season, it was no surprise to me that the hotel looked very busy. Located right next to Tokyo Station (Yaesu North side), it was rather easy to locate the hotel. Having previously stayed at The Tokyo Station Hotel, I knew my way around Tokyo Station and was able to make my way to Shangri-la very easily. One criticism of the location though, is that there is no fully sheltered access to Tokyo Station, the end of the pathway leaves you exposed to the elements, albeit for only 25 metres or so, assuming you know which short cut to take, otherwise it's a longer distance being in the open. Unfortunately it took me 3 days before I learnt of that short cut. Like many other hotels in Tokyo, Shangri-la is located inside of an office tower, meaning that while the entrance is on the ground floor/basement (if arriving by car/taxi), the hotel lobby itself is on the 26th floor. To get to the rooms, one has to go up to the 26th floor and switch to another set of elevators. Not particularly inconvenient but a tad irksome if you're coming back from a long and tiring day. The property is tastefully decorated, featuring a very nice mix of oriental ornaments and art work. The grand staircase lends a very grand feeling to the hotel. I particularly liked that the elevator doors were made to resemble traditional wooden doors. The lounge across the Front Desk has a great view of the city. Then again, most rooms have a good view as well. The rooms are well decorated with all the modern conveniences one would expect in a luxury hotel. Electronic control panels for the entire room located right next to the bed and a full range of amenities. The long sofa in the room was particularly useful for me, as it allowed me to drop off my daily purchases and sort them without having to sit on the floor or the bed. Wifi speed was excellent and the study table had all the necessary outlets, as well as in international adapter. I had my own adapter but appreciated that Shangri-la thought to include one in the room anyway. I did wish the television had more international channels but that wasn't a big deal. The closet is huge and was perfect for my week long stay, allowing me to hang up all my clothes nicely. Like some of the other luxury hotels in Tokyo, that I've had the good fortune to stay in, Shangri-la provided umbrellas in their rooms. Considering that I was visiting during the wet season, I was most grateful. The bathroom is huge, especially the shower area. Like many other hotels, the shower area is located next to the bathtub. I found the rain shower to be a bit lacking in water pressure, maybe due to the fact that each room has rather high ceilings (more of a pro than a con in my books, made the room feel even more spacious than it already is). The regular shower head though was great, water was consistently warm/hot and water pressure strong. The bed itself was comfortable but not as good as some other hotels I've stayed in. Not a major complaint as it is still very good although I did find the sheets to be a bit stiff. Regardless, I was still able to get a decent night's rest. The fitness facilities are decent, although the gym isn't very big and could use a better range of equipment. The pool wasn't bad, although I was surprised at how crowded it was. Other business/luxury hotels I visited rarely had people using the pool, Shangri-la's was the opposite, even at 7am in the morning. As I preferred less people around, I only used the pool once. Service, as it is with almost all of Japan, was excellent. Every inquiry was met with knowledgeable responses. Even if the staff was unfamiliar with the topic in question, he/she would do a quick search online and come back with all the necessary information. The ground floor staff would greet every returning guest and would ask of their day and if there was anything they could assist with. Certainly made me feel very welcomed. On the whole, I would very much recommend Shangri-la Tokyo to anyone who might be keen to stay there. Personally, I find the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo to be a tad better in terms of service but that is probably more of a personal preference. The soft product is very much subjective but hard product is equally good. Without a doubt, I'd be happy to stay at Shangri-la Tokyo again if the opportunity ever arose.","Singapore, Singapore","Daryllee84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",43,5.0

I like this hotel. However, the last few trips have fallen a bit short. I have a few things I like to make sure I get. One is a non-smoking room. I hate smoke and I have asthma so it is pretty high priority. When I visited a month or so ago I ended up in a room that was suppose to be non smoking but could smell someone had smoked in. The hotel I guess was booked and they couldn't move me.My recent trip, my second request is a king bed. I just like big beds --- no health reason for this request. They gave me a room with 2 twins. I was there for several days and I asked if they had a different room. They said they did but it would be an upgrade so I would need to spend more. I was surprised with this response.... Is this the Japan I know and love?Being that I ALWAYS pay extra to use the horizon club and have been a very loyal customer, I mistakenly thought that would count. Will I stay again? Yes, I likely will, it is a good location, clean and comfortable. Does it feel like a luxury stay or special ... Not at all. Depending on why you are in Tokyo you would have to factor that in.

We stayed twice during a recent trip to Japan - at the start and end of our trip. The thing that really stood out for us was the excellent level of service we received at all stages.Before we even arrived, we requested that the hotel make us restaurant reservations to overcome the language barrier. The team were happy to book everything from Michelin starred extravaganzas to small rough and ready joints ensuring we were able to experience the full range of what was on offer. The hotel even secured us reservations in restaurants outside Tokyo when we weren't staying with them. On arrival we were presented with comprehensive notes on each place including directions, distance from hotel, suggested cost/head and which forms of payment were accepted.We had a few issues whilst in Japan, including a mess up with our Japan rail pass. The staff of the Shangri-la insisted on sorting everything out for us, despite the error not being their making. Similarly one night, revelers in the next room were keeping us up (the rooms are well sound-proofed, but these particular guests would have tested the limits of a nuclear bunker). We called the management, who came and sorted things out. The next day, however, we had a hand-written apology from the duty manager, with his personal contact details should we face further issues. We stayed in the Horizon Club rooms and enjoyed access to the lounge that it gave us, and would seriously recommend the investment for anyone who will use the hotel for any time.Overall, as someone who rarely writes reviews, I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone!Thanks again to all the staff who made our stay so memorable.Tom","Birchanger, United Kingdom","TomG160</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birchanger, United Kingdom</strong>",3,5.0

I ended up with unnecessary twin beds due to no availability of a single bed, but other than that the room was perfect: immaculately clean, spacious (especially by Tokyo standards) with everything I could possibly need and a pleasant, open view looking out high above Tokyo Station and across to the Marunouchi business district.Staff I encountered everywhere in the hotel were excellent (checkin, checkout, gym and poolside, Italian and Japanese restaurants). Polite, professional, helpful and many also with genuine warmth and not pure rehearsed professionalism.Although I pass through Tokyo Station often, I never realised just how close Shangri-La is, and it was an excellent choice for me as I arrived and departed by Shinkansen and the trains are only a short walk away, mostly under cover.I'm still in some shock from the price of the final bill, but this was mostly a consequence of a last minute booking in a peak time.

We were disappointed that although there was a Nespresso machine in the hotel room, there were no cups. The hotel charged you for tea and coffee, which was also extremely disappointing.

The concierge staff was exceptional even helping me in trying to locate a restaurant that I had visited in the past but could not remember the name. The restaurant had been located in the past for (2011) by the concierge at Shiba Park Hotel. The Shangri-La Concierge listened to my rough description and even called the Shiba Park Hotel, and was able to find the restaurant and book reservation for us! Their service was was exceptional with all other requests and in answering all questions. The dining services was exceptional, and breakfast was included in our stay. Breakfast offered both traditional Japanese Breakfast options and Western Style Breakfast. The rooms are modern with first rate amenities, and very large by Japanese standards. The views are amazing from the lobby floor and rooms. The hotel offers great access to Tokyo and other parts of Japan via JR Rail Lines, and Tokyo Metro.

I am already a fan of all Shangri-la Hotels,so as soon as i saw there is one in Tokyo, did not look even for other options. The service was great, The Reception Manager Kenji Tsubahara was very helpful, kind and warm. The usual Shangri-la hospitality is even enhanced with Japanese kindness. So as soon as you arrive at the hotel, you really feel as in your home,they make this very well.The location is good, but it depends on what you are looking for. I prefer to stay in calm places with a nice view and close location to downtown. Tokyo has main centers, it is very difficult to choose the best center, this one is close to Ginza. (5-10 minutes by walking).Ginza is considered a luxurious shopping area, I did not do any shopping but the restaurants,bars and coffeshops were great here. If you want to stay in craziness of Tokyo, Shibuya or Shinjuku may be more favorable for you. Shangri-la Tokyo is more in a calm and organized part of the city, but since the hotel starts at high level of the building, the view is fantastic. The rooms are very clean and very big. In the pictures it is not obvious but the room space is just very good. I tried the spa twice, Chi-Spa is great but very expensive as usual. At the Spa, for weekends they charge you more for treatments because there are a lot of people coming from outside to use it, but i kindly explain that i am a hotel guest and it is not very fair to charge extra for hotel guest as well, so they were kind and did not charge extra. Again we have tried all the restaurants, they are all great but very expensive.

The room had two large windows overlooking Tokyo with Tokyo Bay in the distance.The hotel is above the Tokyo train station, sort of between the Yaesu North and Nihonbashi gates. It is about 15-20 minute walk to the Ginza district (basically down the Sukiyabashi street I think) and across the train station from the emperor's palace. It's relatievly short train ride to Shibuya, the meiji shrine, and other popular destinations.But, what really set the hotel apart was the unbelievable service. They helped arranged reservations for lunch and dinner at some difficult to get restaurants. My wife was ill for one of the days. The staff helped us get some medication from the drug store. At one point we thought about going to the ER and the staff called around to get information for us. The staff repeatedly checked in on my wife and even sent some special tea and honey with a get well note to the room for her. They sent a gift and note to the room for my birthday as well. Finally, we had a lunch just before needing to head to the airport. The staff stored at bags at the bell stand and met us there after lunch to walk us to the Narita Express, ensuring that we would get on the train in time to catch our flight (Tokyo station is large and can be confusing).

On the ""city-view"" side of the hotel, which the website brags about ""overlooking Tokyo Bay"", there is actually a massive construction site with large cranes. The construction on the building which is no more than 50 meters from the window is now at about the 30th floor and will wake you with banging and drills at around 7AM. I have read in other reviews that when other guests have requested to change their room, they were charged extra. My view is that paying $800 per night for a room should allow you to have a decent nights sleep, and that by not advising guests about this issue before they check-in is misleading and dishonest.The front desk staff mishandled the check-in and check-out. When checking in, the woman told me my Visa card was not accepted, meaning that I had to use my Amex. Of course, beyond the embarrassment of being told that your card is rejected, of course anyone would need to check to see why the card company rejected the payment. So after spending an hour of my time and more than $100 to make an overseas phone call to the card company, they told me that the woman at the front desk processed the card incorrectly. After going back to the front desk, another woman confirmed that there was no problem with the card. When checking out, instead of just processing the credit card for the full amount of the room, the woman at the front desk said that I would need to fill out paper forms, from which they would get approval from the card company for the additional amount over the initial amount from check-in, otherwise I would need to wait for them to call the credit card bank (are we back in the 1970's??)! Eventually, another employee stepped in and said that they could process a new charge for the entire room amount and then after we left he would cancel the approved amount processed at check-in, which I guess would actually overcharge the credit card and then reverse some charge later. Since we were in a hurry I chose this option and left. By the way, at this hotel, they actually take your passport and scan it into their computer!! Good luck with trusting their protection against misuse of your personal information! There were other incidents where employees were trying to swipe my Golden Circle card to use points to pay for drinks (only problem is that the Golden Circle card does not have a magnetic strip, kind of funny I guess), and other more minor problems with the room, etc... Overall, the service at the hotel was very poor. For the most part the employees were kind, but I felt they didn't have adequate training. As for the rooms, they were pretty average (we had a premier and deluxe room), but the fact that the hotel does not inform the guests about the construction directly outside their window is in my opinion dishonest. We have stayed at Shangri-La hotels all over Asia for the last 20 years and this is by far the worst experience. Next time we will try the Four Seasons, which is just on the other side of Tokyo station.","Tokyo Prefecture, Japan","Chris H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo Prefecture, Japan</strong>",27,1.0

We had to pay extra to ""upgrade"" to the other side with Imperial Garden view. The French windows were unfortunately not the cleanest. We checked. It looked like the marks are on the other side of the inner piece, i.e. not cleaned properly before installation. After one night, we informed the Horizon Club reception staff that our bed was too soft. The staff said all hard mattresses were out but they would put a board beneath our mattress for our 2nd night and would change to a hard mattress for our 3rd night. On the 3rd morning before lunch, we went to the reception to enquire. A different staff was there and we had to tell her what was agreed. By the way, a staff confirmed they have a policy of changing the staff every 3 days; it's very frustrating. However, the mattress turned out softer than the first 2 nights. This gave us a bad lower back ache. Something basic like a good night's rest was not possible for us even though we paid top dollar for a so-called 5-star hotel. Overall, the service level was at best average. The staff at Horizon Club reception seem very patronising.

It's towards the higher end I've ever paid for a hotel room, but I can't complain about the space, quality, service, location, or anything else.Spacious - being our first time to Japan, we were slightly concerned about whether we'd have room to swing a cat, not that we brought one. Turns out pussy could have come too - plenty of room, lounge, dining table, 1.5 very spacious bathrooms.Food - being an exec suite, we had access to the somethingorother club. We quite often do that sort of thing, as it solves the breakfast problem and sometimes the dinner problem too if we're not too hungry. The breakfasts were exceptionally good. Evening snacks less so, but still perfectly fine.Amenity - the hotel is in the top section of a tall building with offices in the bottom. Consequently, there's no such thing as a lower floor. We were second top, and heard no street noise at all.Location - just around the corner from the Tokyo station, so you're right near the Narita Express to the airport, Shinkansen to the ski fields, or metro for all of Tokyo. *Very* convenient. That said, Tokyo station has about a million exits, so if you're starting from the hotel the staff will give you directions and you'll find the station easily. But if you're arriving by train, don't imagine you'll walk out of the station and see the hotel across the road. Your chances of coming out an exit anywhere near the hotel are practically zero, and getting it wrong could involve kilometres of stumbling about with baggage.Tokyo station is big and confusing. It's a fabulous transport resource, but *do* schedule in time to get lost and wander about. Twice it took us a good 45 minutes inside the station to get to the right place with the right ticket. Second time around, it's easy.There's certainly cheaper places to stay in Tokyo, but the Shangri-La is exceptionally user-friendly and perfectly located for transport.","Sydney, Australia","Waimate01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",173,5.0

From the airport one's first exposure to this supercity is Tokyo station which has numerous exits and is warren-like in it's structure. Leaving by the 'wrong' exit results in a 15 minute trudge around it's perimeter. Arrival at the hotel is , therefore, the equivalent of a ray of sunshine reflecting off a building on a grey January morning. The staff are polite beyond comprehension. The rooms- even at the cheaper end of the tariff -are splendid with views towards the bay,in my case, or Shinjuku and Mount Fuji if you are fortunate, from the other side. The lounge area is perfect for a spot of lunch or a soothing, early evening glass of buttery Californian chardonnay watching the sun set over the Tokyo Skytower. Outside of the 6 large stations, of which Shinjuku is the grandest with over 200 exits and usage by 3.5 million people per day, the city is calming and unthreatening at any time. Japanese music is the music of reticence , the soft voice is admired, and the way that the city extracts a calming order from palpable chaos is something at which to marvel. There is no mobile phone interference on trains, no eating in public and, outside of the areas in which the young congregate, there is an almost complete addiction to understatement. Rather like Shangri-la itself the mystery which lies at the core of Tokyo leaves one emotionally satisfied and mentally at ease.

The hotel is located perfectly, the service overall is as expected and the rooms are very nice. Standard fare but with an upmarket decor. I couldn't give this property the total praise it could easily deserve for an incident at check-in. Let me explain.We arrived at about 10am which agreed is before the alloacted check-in time, however we knew this and were happy to leave our bags and go out for a while until our room was ready. We were then told that our room category was not abvailable yet and that for 15,000 YEN we could go directly to a room that was available (Horizon floor). We declined and found that a little odd after just hearing the lady next to us offer her guest the same explanation at a cost of 9,000 YEN which he accepted. I mentioned this to our lady checking us in and queried it, as soon as she started to get confused the front desk manager came over and said ""oh, it looks like your room is available immediately, you can go up now"". I found this very odd for a Shangri-la and this was cause for concern. I will be following this up with head office as I feel something unethical is happening here. I don't mind paying for service and accomodation of this nature as this is the way we prefer to travel, but this has made me very weary.","Perth, Australia","Hollywood1973</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",130,4.0

In two nights, Shangri La Tokyo managed to completely restore my faith in the brand and offer me one of the very best levels of service that I have ever experienced (I am comparing, among others, to multiple Peninsulas, Mandarin Orientals, Four Seasons's, Park Hyatts, Ritz Carltons, St Regis's, etc). The stay was in a Horizon Club room and with Signature travel perks.The level of attention to detail is simply astonishing, from the little teddy bear or origami that accompanied my turndown service (I loved that!) to the three different types of bath salts that allow you to run a bath that effectively suits your mood (jasmine, chamomile, or rose)! The Horizon club benefits allow you to enjoy your breakfast as a room service set menu which is a very big plus when you feel jetlagged, or in the club itself with signature dishes that include a lovely lobster and potato cake benedict or a full Japanese breakfast bento as well as freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juices. The food quality at the Japanese restaurant Namasan was also excellent. My brother lives in Tokyo and he and his girlfriend came to meet me at the hotel multiple times as it is conveniently located by Tokyo station. On one occasion, after dinner, my brother's girlfriend felt very poorly and the hotel team was extremely helpful, with the duty manager visiting her as she came to briefly rest in my room, and proposing to call a doctor. The next day, everyone was asking me how she was feeling and showed plenty of sympathy.The location is excellent - by Tokyo station (Nihombashi exit is the best) and within 10 minutes walk of both the Imperial Palace gardens to the West and Ginza. The rooms are large (about 50sq m), very intelligently equipped (fully automated blinds, fully centralised yet intuitive lights systems, etc) and the views are very beautiful from all sides of the building (my favourite was towards the Imperial Palace but some people will prefer the view towards Tokyo Bay and the Sky tree, in effect, it is very pretty on every side, especially as all rooms are between the 30th and 37th floor anyway!). Horizon Club rooms come with all the trimmings: wet area with both bathtub and rainshower and bay window to the room and outside views (and blinds that can be lowered if anyone is feeling modest!), Nespresso machine, pyjamas (shame for the polyester/cotton mix rather than pure cotton but the thought is already wonderful!), the usual Shangri La stationery kit (very convenient on a business trip), etc. That said, once again, what makes the place really special is the incredibly thoughtful and attentionate level of service - this is hospitality at its very best and an example many other luxury hotels should try to learn from.",,eurolondoner,147,5.0

The concierge came to gather my luggage to bring it to my cart. As I was closing my luggage, the latch broke. Long story short, the host took me to the nearest mall to purchase a new luggage. While purchasing the luggage, the associate at the mall swiped my card twice for some reason, therefore the security for the credit card company blocked my card. They then swiped my second card which didnt go through, therefore I had no cards and not enough cash to buy the luggage. The Hotel host left his hotel ID and hat with the Sales Associate at the mall.

You can ask for a room that overlooks the back of the station so you can see all the trains coming and going - it feels like having your own personal train set! On a clear day you get a very good view of Mount Fuji from those rooms too. It must be very well sound-proofed, though, because there is no noise, either externally or internally - it is a very quiet hotel. The rooms are beautiful and you are given lots of thoughtful extras - lovely Bulgari toiletries, beautiful kimonos to wear while you are there, and even clean white cotton pyjamas every night - it does make you feel very spoiled and special. The public spaces are wonderful too and I would definitely recommend the hotel's Japanese restaurant, which is an experience all on its own - excellent food, exquisitely presented and served by kimono-clad waitresses.

This is our forth stay over past 6 years. Below is a quick summary from my recent experience - 1. Check in: there was an flexible front desk staff called 'mammi'. We had an Amex coupon that we used to book for 2 nights and the other 2 nights we booked with corporate rates. She refused to combine our booking upon arrival and told us we had to check out after 2 nights and change to another room. She told us that we had to pay more if we were to stay in the same room. We waited for more than 30 minutes at the front desk and she didn't escalate the problem but was very rude and insisted we pay and made other staff look at us as if we had not pay our bills or something. We had to escalate this to the head of the desk which we waited another hour, so we left our luggage while we went for our lunch at 3.30pm which we were starving. mammi's boss called us and apologised and resolved the issue. I told her how upset we were being the 4th times return guests. The rest of our stay was smooth as expected. But I would try to stay in another hotel closer to the main shopping attractions. Shangrila hotel is a little far from places like Shibuya, Shinjuku, Harajuku etc, And for luxury shopping in Ginza, it's a 15 mins taxi ride which isn't cheap going back and forth each day. In terms of facilities, I do love the pool at the Shangrla, their gym is also good. Shangrila is ideal for tourists who travel out of Tokyo for a day trip or as connecting hub. We went to Haneda a few years ago and stayed in a luxury hot spring villa for a night between our stay at Shangrila.","Hong Kong, China","HKBride06</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",18,3.0

I'm struggling to find just one issue with this hotel. I travel often for business internationally and this hotel is unmatched. This hotel is exquisite. From the moment I arrived the staff was one step ahead of me in meeting my needs. They understand western culture and are exceedingly gracious as is all Japan. I entered my room and was greeted by very relaxing music which calmed me immediately following a hectic travel schedule. My room was very large and I had more amenities than at home from the high tech toilet to the electronic window shades. My room was above Tokyo Station on floor 36. I heard no sound from outside. Upon my arrival I changed from my business suit to casual business attire for dinner on short order. I left my slacks draped on the bed. I returned from dinner to find my slacks pressed and hanging and the tea/coffee bar went to a cocktail presentation. Pajamas and slippers were waiting for me as well as a bottle of water and a glass by my bedside.

Perfect location just 2 minutes from main station (but absolutely no noise in the rooms as the hotel is on 26+ floor), walking distance of Ginza and max. 5 minutes to restaurants, several Starbucks and a 7/11-like store at the entrance of main station. Department store Daimaru with an outstanding food selection - grocery in the basement comparable to Dean&Deluca and restaurants in the top floors - is just 5 Minutes away.

Very spacious rooms with wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling windows, no sounds of neighbour rooms or from outside, well equipped, and a top bathroom area. Great rainfall shower with high water pressure, what I like. Sooo comfortable beds. Everything immaculately clean. Top service all around. Not just friendly and helpful and fluent in english, which is already asked a lot nowadays even in better hotels, but forward-thinking and caring. One example: On arrival I gave front desk a small piece of paper with my (potentially lethal) food allergies written in english and kindly asked to write down the japanese translations to have them on hand when visiting a restaurant. Okay, standard so far. But when I ordered room service a couple days later they knew about the allergies without me having to tell them - that's what I consider customer orientation. Perfect meet and greet service on the station platform when we arrived with the NEX Narita Express Train (we never were able to find the way through the at times confusing station upon arrival). And so on and so on - whatever we thought of, hotel staff took care of us. To make the most of any review on Trip Advisor you really need to know the typical places the reviewer stays and the standards of judgment. After 3.000+ hotel nights in my career I just want a clean and quite place and good service and do not really care about the room size or price in the first place. And a memorable experience is a plus, especially while on vacation. I do judge by peer groups and price levels: What could you in all fairness expect from a Hotel within its peer group – because else even good quality basic hotels had no chance for good reviews against top notch places.Having said that: This is a top notch hotel compared against any other place.

With a room on a high floor, you will never wake up happier seeing the sun rise and coming back at night to an unforgettable skyline. The room itself is fit for a king and more with its abundant space (and a beautiful bathroom!). Breakfast spread was truly amazing and they were kind enough to agree to my special request of poached eggs every morning. The housekeeping staff also did an excellent job in arranging my toiletries that every person with a neat/orderly streak would be thoroughly impressed. On the last day, I had the privilege to be accompanied to the train station with one of the staff who helped with my baggage (which I really felt bad about as she was really petite but strong!). Perhaps the only downside was that I found the gym a little too small for a hotel of this standard but it is compensated with a heated pool which you could cover some laps after a long day of walking/work.

Lobby entry (28th floor) and a very enjoyable atmosphere all the way around. I stayed here for business 3 nights and wanted to entertain a group of colleagues in the Lobby Lounge on a busy night - not a problem. Kudos to Lounge Manager and also Guest Relations Officer, Claudia Ho - event flawlessly executed and everyone had a great time - the stunning views from the 28th floor Lobby Lounge night sky was a fantastic backdrop. Enjoyed high-tea with 5 colleagues - very nicely executed.

On this occasion I got the rather euphemistically named ""harbour view"" - really just a city view of Nihonbashi - and missed seeing the Shinkansen trains pulling into and out of the station below - but that's me. Everything in the room works. There is full connectivity in a panel by the desk. The bathroom is amongst the best of any hotel I've ever been to: by putting in a large window, it feels light and airy. (There is of course a blind.) Having the pool on a high floor is also a feature of Japanese hotels, but the spa and gym facilities are impeccable, with attentive and friendly staff. Lastly, it happened to be my birthday, and I came back to the room to find a bottle of wine, glasses, and corkscrew, but most notably, a hand-written and illustrated card.

It is buffet style but there is plenty of choice and for hot dishes the staff take your order and served at your table after being prepared by the chef. So there is certainly not the usual food that has been sat there for some considerable time.The location of the hotel is excellent right against Tokyo station and also close to several Metro stations within a 5 minute walk from the hotel and the main bus terminal is certainly no more than a 5 minute walk so again easy access around the city and sights of Tokyo.The Imperial Palace is about a 10 minute walk from the hotel so again a nice location.While in Tokyo we did a tour to Mnt Fuji and our tour did not pick up at our hotel the pick up point was just the other side of Tokyo station at another hotel and the hotel asked if we wanted to be escorted to the hotel, this we declined as it was a 5 minute walk and you could see the entrance to the pick up point from our hotel but I did see others take this up again service that you don't get everywhere.Our room overlooked Tokyo station and as all the rooms of the hotel are high up there is certainly no problem with noise from the station. A room looking over the station also means there is a good chance of seeing Mount Fuji from your room if the weather is clear enough. We saw it on a few days during our stay.I could not find any fault with this hotel and can't wait to come back to Tokyo just to stay at the same hotel for the service and staff.","Derby, United Kingdom","johnwK6256BA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Derby, United Kingdom</strong>",62,5.0

They really nailed the first impression; from the warm greeting, to the elevator to the sky lobby, to the simple check in, to the thoughtful snack plate laid out in the room (very useful after a 12 hour flight). Of course, the bed was comfortable, the view from the 36th floor unmatched. From there, the little things begin to make a bigger impression; the thick, wooden hangers; the multi-functional coat stand, the electronics kit allowing all manner of devices to sync with the BOSE sound system.Beyond the room, service from the multi-lingual staff was exceptional. Every need was met, and no questions were left unanswered. The pool/fitness area was like a mini-resort in the middle of Tokyo; much appreciated considering the humidity during my stay.Finally, the breakfast at Piacere was great. Planned on doing it once, ended up having it on multiple days.

Better than nothing, but the reception staff were not as nice as they could be when communicating that it wouldn't be possible - they were like whispering between them in Japanese... I didn't like that. The room was very good, but be careful with the 'Imperial Garden View' as the hotel is far from the Imperial Garden and you can barely see a green from the room... Also, I think they gave me a 'accessible room' and the bathroom was a single piece, without a separate shower. Also, the sink was very low... The breakfast was perfect as well as the service and food of the Piacere Italian restaurant (which is very beautiful and elegant). Great spa and and ok Gym. The windows at the pool area were dirty and so it was almost impossible to see the view...

The Shangri-La offers a service where they will meet you at the Tokyo Express Station from the Narita Express train since it is impossible for a tourist to find the right exit since it is a 10-15 minute walk in the station. We emailed the hotel with our train time and car # when we bought our train tickets at the airport.As soon as we got off the train we found our escort/guide from the hotel who was very nice and took us and a bunch of our bags threw the maze that is Tokyo Station. He was very nice and helpful and led us to the 37th floor where there was a special dedicated check-in area for guests staying in Horizon Club rooms as we were. I did want to quickly get to the room and take a shower after our long journey so the 5-10 minute wait to check in was a little annoying but there were snacks and beverages in the lounge which helped The staff was very accommodating and pleasant. I had booked via Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts and asked about a room upgrade. They told us one was available but it was a smoking room and a smoker had just checked out that day so we passedThe room itself (Horizon Club Deluxe Bay View) was beautifully styled, a very nice size with a great view. The bed was very comfortable and room was quiet The only glitch was the lighting controls on different side of the beds were not working quite properly - one set only turned off the lights and one only turned them on - we were able to cope with this minor issue.We had breakfast each morning in the Horzion Club Lounge which was very peaceful and never crowded but with a dedicated staff of 4-5 who made us feel very welcome each morning. The menu was diverse with Western egg options and Japanese choices along with a buffet of breads, fruits and the BEST PASTRY I HAVE EVER EATEN. It was essentially a cronut but far better than the ones sold here in NYC. The orange juice was also delicious although I am not sure why all beverages were filled only halfwayWe used the concierge to book some tickets to a very popular art show.

Check-in was far from smooth, and I still don't understand how some rooms can be both smoking ""and"" non-smoking; some people have allergies and sensitivities to cigarette smoke, so if a guest smokes in a room, then it should be categorized as smoking, no exceptions. Both sides of the hotel have good views - one is of Tokyo station and Marounouchi with glimpses of The Imperial Palace, the other is of Tokyo Bay and the Sky Tree, but the key point is that the check-in staff should not propose what view they or the hotel believes to be the best but rather ask the guest their preference. A la carte service at breakfast was hit and miss, and over the course of our stay several of us experienced long waits of 30 to 40 mins for eggs at Piacere. Having said that, the quality of the food and general level of service in all the hotel outlets was extremely good, and the piano bar in the lobby lounge is very relaxing. The rooms are excellent, particularly the refreshing rain shower and the super comfortable bed. Also enjoyed the location in Nihonbashi right next to Tokyo Station, and a short walk to Ginza and Marounouchi. A hotel porter will meet you at, or escort you to, the platform if arriving or departing by train - a nice touch. Nearly all taxi drivers know the hotel. One staff member that I would like to specifically mention is Handa-San in the club who was first rate. Summing up, a great hotel that I would definitely return to, but would recommend easing up a little on the formalities and prioritize on the primary objectives of most guests utilizing a hotel.

If you're like me and you notice smells, you will find that the hotel fitting your olfactory needs, especially in a city that has not heeded the no-smoking mantra of California. We liked the scent so much so that we even purchased their room spray and reed diffuser. One little nit-picky issue, since all else was impeccable: They need to clean certain areas of their carpets.

Having said that, for a five star hotel and for its price, it just didn't take my breath away. I was expecting luxury and instead, I found a very corporate environment where staff were as polite as they needed to be but didn't make any effort to go above and beyond. My husband and I told the hotel that we were staying there on our fourth wedding anniversary, and yet we didn't even receive so much as a card in our room! For anyone else who has ever stayed in luxury hotels, you'll know that generally a hotel will go above and beyond giving anything from cakes to flowers to cards and special romantic meals in the hotel restaurants. We stayed there for twelve nights and it was only a couple days before we were due to check out that we received a note through our door asking us if there was anything extra they could do for us as we were staying for such a long time. I think generally they are used to only short stays, and from businessmen. That was certainly the vibe we got--everyone seemed to be there on business, probably because of the area. There weren't the niceties or personal touches of luxury stay. On one occasion, our room wasn't cleaned at all and there were no fresh towels when we got back from a long day in the city-- they said that we had our 'no disturb' sign on, when we clearly had not. One morning we were woken up at 7:25AM by a fire alarm, which shouted that there was a fire on the 35th floor. This went on for about 15 minutes. We were heavily jet-lagged, panicked and quickly grabbed our passports from the safe and threw on our clothes from the day before, running to the lift to get out of what we thought was a burning building. When we made it down to the lobby the staff were standing around with big grins on their faces and told us that a hotel guest had pulled the alarm by accident. As it wasn't peak season and I believe all guests were being kept on just three or four floors, why hadn't they sent someone up to each floor, just to stand by the lifts to put guests at ease and tell them everything was ok and to go back up to their room? All of the guests were in a blind panic, and the staff were just standing there as if nothing at all was happening. It was incredibly irritating and the only apology was, again, a note put through our door later that evening. The TV remote didn't work. The light in the bathroom flicked constantly, which we told the concierge about, but it was never fixed. It stayed faulty for the entire 12 days. We paid for a garden view, but our room actually overlooked a train track. I could see a corner of the imperial palace garden, but only with binoculars. This was very misleading on their website.The pool/gym facilities only stay open until ten in the evening. For anyone expecting a pool with views of the city, this isn't it. It was a very small pool with lanes set up, very much for fitness and definitely not a pool for lazing around in or enjoying views over the city. Just being honest! Everyone else seems to think the service here was great--really wish I had experienced the same. I'm not incredibly picky, but I do stay luxury 5* everywhere so that I feel I'm a bit of an expert in this area. I give Shangri-La a three because you don't remember necessarily everything about a trip, but you do remember how the hotel staff made your feel. And Shangri-La only made me feel 3*.","London, United Kingdom","Chelsea M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",3,3.0

Firstly, my only criticism, and I mean my only one, is that despite my husband having spent a very extended time here before, we weren't given any kind of recognition for this. I think some kind of upgrade should have been offered as my husband, while he is on a business trip, is given a choice of hotels and decided on this one after a previous stay.The good points about the hotel are:The staff are never overwhelming. I have stayed in other hotels where you spend your life bowing back to staff. It can be quite exhausting!We were allowed access to the health club which is normally $50 a day here in Japan which is prohibitive for a long stay. The pool is spotlessly clean as are the hot tub and all the facilities.The beds are unbelievably comfortable and given the volume of visitors it is nice to have no second hand blankets and bedspreads which, in other hotels, have been stained with goodness knows what. Only sheets and duvet covers, all washable are provided.The TV system is very convenient with an HDMI plug in provided. A must in Japan for watching Netflix as there is little English TV.The rooms are quiet with triple glazing.The bathroom wall is glass with a remote blind so that with the blind up you can see through the whole room and this makes the whole experience much more spacious.The view over the palace gardens is lovely.The carpets are clean! At the Intercontinental in Yokohama (not a cheap hotel) the carpets were filthy and we were told they were too busy to get a window of opportunity to clean them. Not an acceptable excuse!The breakfasts on the room service menu are reasonably priced and arrive exactly on time. Important for my husband who commutes to Yokohama every morning.On that note, my husband chose and hour long commute so that we could stay in this hotel as opposed to a ten minute walk had we stayed in a hotel in Yokohama. He was really impressed with his previous experience.I am here for another ten days and am sure my stay will be really pleasurable.I would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to my next trip!","Cornwall, Canada","AntoinetteM199</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cornwall, Canada</strong>",12,5.0

Had good experiences with various Shangri La hotels throughout Asia, so wanted to see if this compared to others we had stayed in Tokyo (such as Hyatt, Hilton, Peninsula). Upshot - exceeded expectations. Room was great - corner on the Horizon floor with top notch amenities (Bvlgari and Nespresso which was promptly refilled), wonderful assortment of goodies as a welcome gift. As I had indicated we had a child of 5 as well, the hotel had provided special amenities for the little one such as little bedroom slippers, personal packs of shampoo, moisturisers, soap for kids, a kids toothbrush, the Shangri-La bears were a nice touch for her, and so on. It was unexpected. Fruit always available. The Horizon club did not disappoint and we used it extensively. They catered to your needs very well. The breakfast selection is good and specialised since we could order off the menu. As usual, the service impeccable and the staff always polite and very courteous - that's what I call service with a smile since they made you very welcome. The hotel reception is located on the 28th floor so it was a bit unusual in that we always had to take 2 elevators to get to the room. Being next to Tokyo station is great as that meant getting around very easy. Since we flew in via Haneda, the convenience of being at the Tokyo station becomes very apparent since we did not have to take too many trains to and fro (the monorail to the JR Line and vice versa). Hotel within easy walking distance to Ginza so that was convenient. Certainly I would say this was an extremely pleasurable stay and no doubt we would stay there again.","Singapore, Singapore","fred_shen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",17,5.0

This was my first time staying in a Shangri-la hotel and I immediately loved it. The location right on top of the Tokyo Station complex is incredibly convenient. When we first arrived at the station, it was a bit difficult to navigate our way to the hotel because of the vast size and the complexity of the busy station. Remember to look for the 'Nihombashi Exit' and you will be fine. The hotel was literally steps away from this exit. Although the hotel was housed in an office building on the upper floors, it had a dedicated ground floor lobby with express elevators to the main lobby.The hotel was beautifully decorated with a modern, contemporary feel. The only thing to fault was the size and scale of the main lobby. It just did not match up with the grand and luxurious feel of the hotel brand. I guess it's because of Tokyo's sky-high land value, especially in this very heartland of the capital. It might make better sense to understate the scale of the main lobby for the sake of efficient use of space. For the same reason, we initially expected the room to be matchbox tiny but we were wrong. We stayed at the 'Skytree view room' and we had no complaints! The size was spacious enough to put a king-size bed, a big lounge sofa, a large working desk and a huge bathroom. The bathroom had a separate tub and a rain shower. I love the view from my room. The Tokyo metropolitan cityscape from high above was mesmerising. We had buffet breakfast at the restaurant one day and american breakfast at the bar the next day. We had drinks in the hotel bar one evening. The service was top notch and the quality of the food and beverages was impressive. Staff members were warm, friendly and proactive to make our stay comfortable.

On departure, we were also brought directly to the Narita Express train platform. In fact, we were a bit late on that day and we owe a big thank-you to Yuki who nearly broke her ankle running in her heels with us to the train platform all while dragging a couple of suitcases. The room was large with a nice view of Tokyo Sky Tree. The bathroom had a gigantic rain shower and a Japanese toilet that had more functions than the one at the Four Seasons. Blackout curtains, a comfy bed and pyjamas laid out for you at bedtime made for a great sleep. Breakfast was included with the Club room and you could have it delivered to your room if you wanted. WiFi was fast and free. The concierge was efficient at making restaurant reservations and booking bus and train tickets.

We came into Tokyo station on the Shinkansen express train from Kyoto after having mistakenly boarded the wrong train when we departed (an easy mistake to make and a story in itself). Nonetheless, the first sight that we encountered when the door opened was the smiling Shangri-La representative, who guided us and our luggage smoothly and efficiently thru the maze that is Tokyo Station. This much appreciated service had also been provided a week earlier when we had arrived at Narita on a red eye from Hanoi. This in itself, along with it's proximity to the station is almost reason enough to stay here. However, the story doesn't end there, as this is an absolutely topnotch luxury hotel. The hotel excels in every important dimension, including rooms, facilities (we loved the pool), food (excellent breakfast buffet), and most of all, the service. We've stayed in luxury hotels all over the world, but this place rates near the top of the list for graciousness and attention to detail. It also didn't hurt that during our initial visit our room was available immediately upon arrival at 9:00am, or that for our second stay of one night (prior to departure home) that we were upgraded to a stunning corner jr suite on the 35th floor, with a sweeping view over the Imperial Palace. This touch of opulence was just what we needed before facing the end of our vacation and the long flight back to Boston. This hotel is not inexpensive, but you certainly get what you pay for.

This is not a young and trendy hotel with a great party scene, but a great 5-star hotel with all the top notch creature comforts and service level from all members of staff.Be warned, if you are looking for a resort styled hotel with lots of activities for kids this is not the one.

We took a bullet train from Nagoya and the hotel was just right next to the JR Tokyo main station. No doubt the station is a very big one and the walk was probably about 10-15 mins but it was all mainly inside the station. From this hotel, we can take the Ginza line from the Nihombashi Station just a short walk away or the Tozai line from Otemachi station which is practically outside the hotel. Of course the JR line from the JR Tokyo station. However the Marunouchi line from Tokyo station is a bit far to walk which is on the other side of the JR station.The hotel is very luxurious. The room and the bathroom is big and comfortable. My husband says that the bed is very comfortable. I find that the pillows are a bit soft. I could have it changed I guess if I had requested. However I don't see a pillow menu in the rooms though. The lady at the concierge was very helpful when I asked her to confirm another accommodation in another city.Overall my family and I are very satisfied with the stay even though the rates are a bit expensive and on top of that the government has just implemented a consumption tax.We were very unlucky to have missed the cherry blossoms by a week.

This isn't a bad thing if you you want soft landing into Tokyo as they sort out everything for you and the places oozes quality and for me was perfect stress free start to my trip in a city completely new to me. Breakfast also worth mentioning, huge choice of everything.Waiting and bar staff remember how you like your food, drinks etc and it's all delivered in a friendly relaxed way.Staff to guest ratio feels right, whenever you need something there always seemed to be someone there ready to help but you never noticed or feel like staff are hovering. You're always addressed you by name and I don't think I was asked for our room number once, they are that on the ball. We had front of house speak to us at least once a day to check everything was ok and gave us useful tips and pointers on where to go. There are hallmarks throughout of an excellently run hotel. Small note; by Tokyo standards it's not expensive but coming from the UK it's definitely not cheap. We spent 3 nights, we dined one night in the hotel restaurant, hit the bar a few times and there wasn't much change out of £2.5k.

It was a very pleasant stay, as the rooms, staff and service, were as excellent or better compared to other Shangri-la hotels we have visited. We stayed in a Horizon Club Premier Room (i.e. corner room) on the 32th floor, where we were able to overlook Tokyo magnificently, as the room has two spacious windows since it’s a corner room. The room was well-equipped with coffee maker, Wi-Fi, mini bar, etc. The bed was very spacious and comfortable also. We had access to the exclusive Horizon Club Lounge on the 36th floor, where we frequent every late afternoon for a couple drinks and snacks before dinner. We really enjoyed the lounge, as it’s is very private and the service outstanding. In addition, all staff in the hotel spoke very good English and were professional. We also wandered down a couple times to the lobby lounge on the 28th floor. It’s also a great place to enjoy cocktails, beer and canapés. As the hotel is associated with an office building, there were quite a few professional Japanese folks talking business at the bar & lounge area. Because of the prime location of the hotel, we were able walk to local Japanese restaurants which served anything from ramen, noodles, & rice. However, we also had a very splendid romantic dinner at Piacere, which is the Italian restaurant in the hotel offering authentic Italian cuisine. During the dinner they offered Bellavista Brut champagne, a decadent chocolate cake and Nicolai Bergmann Designed Flower box. We were not able to eat the chocolate cake, as we had other dessert which was included in the set menu, however when we went back to our room after dinner, the delicious chocolate cake was sent by the staff to our room.We also had a chance to eat in the high-end in-hotel Japanese restaurant Nadaman. Everything from beef to seafood, wine and tea were splendid. You will definitely have to give it a try! What made our stay so special was the incredible service oriented staff Shangri-la Tokyo has. It all began the moment we stepped out of the airport, as Shangri-la staff were already waiting for us to escort us to the private car to the hotel. They were very patient and friendly when we were seeking suggestions for activities in Tokyo. You can feel and visual notice there’s a very strong management team running this hotel. In summary, a very memorable stay, and I would highly recommend Shangri-la Tokyo to anybody who plans a trip to Tokyo!","Ithaca, New York","545456864357</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ithaca, New York</strong>",6,5.0

It had become a tradition to stay there on my final night. However, the last time I stayed there I was disappointed in the service so decided to try something new. At the time I was making my plans the Shangri-La was above the Mandarin in ratings, and it was even closer to the Tokyo station, so I decided to give it a try. I was VERY happy that I did.To begin with, you are extravagantly greeted, both at the street level and the lobby level. The lobby is on a higher floor (I can't remember exactly on what floor it was, but it was quid lofty). I had joined their ""Horizon Club"" and was ushered into a nicely appointed lounge where I checked in. I had to wait a few minutes to be able to go to my room, but they could have left me there for hours because of the delicious snacks and unlimited supply of alcoholic beverages that were offered. After a very short wait, a very helpful and gracious staff member escorted me to a very large corner room which, although a bit smaller than the suite in which I usually stayed at the Mandarin, didn't seem at all small, and was indeed quite spacious, with a fantastic view of the city of Tokyo, with the Tokyo Sky Tree towering over the whole thing. I even had a good view of the aforementioned Mandarin. There were elegant snacks (fruit, etc) waiting for me, and the room promised a luxurious final place to rest before heading home. It featured a huge bathtub with a great view of the Tokyo skyline, and even had a ""washlet"" toilet which did just about everything automatically.I had maid arrangements to meet with friends at Piacere, the hotel's excellent restaurant, and we were given a ""semi-private"" table which, although not in a different room, was at least separated from the rest of the ""madding crowd."" The food, by the way, was top notch, and was appreciated by everyone. They even had my favorite gin!After lunch my friends left and I came back to my room to relax and enjoy the luxury of the place. Instead of traipsing around Tokyo, I just took the time to bask in the glory of this superb room. I was amused by the reading material in the room. In addition to a vast array of magazines, they also had, instead of the ubiquitous Gideon Bible, a copy of ""The Lost Horizon"" which, I understand, is a story about Shangri-La.The next morning I had a complimentary breakfast buffet at the Placiere restaurant, and it certainly met and exceeded any expectations I had. The buffet was totally superb and you could even order omelets and things like eggs benedict. Fabulous, and with a view of the Marunouichi area of Tokyo. I could even see another of my favorite hotels, the Marunouichi hotel. Anyway, this room was certainly fantastic, wonderful, luxurious, and since I can't come up with any other adjectives, supercalifragilisicexpedaliosious. To quote Disney. I highly recommend this place, and it will now be, as I said before, my final resting place when going to Japan. GREAT!And one more thing...as a member of the Horizon Club I was provided with someone who carried my luggage and took me to the train at the attached Tokyo station. As I have traveled a great deal to Tokyo and always take the Narita Express back to the airport, I really didn't need this service, but it was just one more luxury provided by this hotel.","Kaneohe, Hawaii","Whitsiepoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaneohe, Hawaii</strong>",164,5.0

My first few days were spent at the Park Hyatt (see my review there) so the Shang was quite a change in comparison. It was a completely different vibe (the Shangri La being more of a typical hotel venue and the Park Hyatt having a private feel). Service-wise, I felt that both were on par with each other.As other reviewers have mentioned, it’s not an easy place to find. My cab driver had a little difficulty in finding the drop off area as it’s underground below the building. The hotel is on the upper floors of an office building in a business district, so it doesn’t jump out and scream at you. I did notice the Four Seasons hotel on the way there - for whatever reason their signage was more noticeable.You take an elevator to the 29th floor lobby area to check in. This level also has the lounge, a restaurant, and the elevators to the room floors. You can’t miss the check in desk and someone was available to help me right off the bat. Very friendly service and I was asked if I wanted to arrange my transport to the airport after checkout. They purchased the train ticket for me (billing my room) and offered to escort me there with my bags. There was no service charge for purchasing the ticket. They even extended my checkout to accommodate the train schedule (my flight leaves in the early evening). Check in and check out was done electronically via Wacom tablets on the counter…a nice touch.I had a corner Premier room and it was very nice - elegant and modern. The room wasn’t as cozy as the Park Hyatt. There, almost all amenities are hidden out of view and the room feels more homey. Here, the coffee maker (nespresso machine - nice) and a few other amenities were out in the open making it feel more like…well…a hotel room. Lots of the usual electronic integration that you find at Asian hotels such as motorized binds, light switches, dimmers, Toto washlet, etc… The bathroom was good size and the walk in shower was huge with the tub also in the shower room. It had a handheld shower head as well as a ceiling mounted rainfall type shower head. Plenty of counter space to put items as well as a good size mirror (practically full length). The bed was very comfortable and softer than the one I had at the Park Hyatt.I didn’t eat at any of the onsite restaurants, but I did hang in the lobby lounge area and the service was friendly and prompt. I also ordered room service for breakfast one morning and it was good as well as the service (both on the phone taking the order and in delivering it to my room within 30 minutes). In general the hotel had a very large, grand feel to it. The ceilings were fairly tall on both the main floors and in the elevators (which had chandeliers in them, even). The elevators had tv screens in them playing pictures of the inside of the hotel. There was also music playing in the elevators. This felt a little commercial for me, as if they are advertising themselves while you are riding the elevator. The music was nice but I would have preferred a quiet ride. Anyway, both very trivial complaints.When I departed, a staff member carried my baggage and escorted me right to the Narita express train platform. A nice touch and she was very friendly and talkative on the way there.I highly recommend this hotel, especially if you prefer your home base to be in the Tokyo station area (the hotel is literally right next to the station). I did the majority of my travel using the subway system and it was nice to have such easy access. Also, the service is very similar to other Shangri La’s so if you like this chain, I don’t think it will disappoint.Pro’s:- Facilities: Felt new and modern, yet elegant.- Service: Very attentive. Staff always said hello to me - many remembered my name and addressed me as such - and lots of smiles and bowing. If I encountered a staff member in the hallway, they always stopped what they were doing and stepped to the side, unless I was getting in an elevator at which they’d escort me to it. Certainly not necessary but it does make you feel that you are a VIP.- Room: very well appointed. Good selection of amenities in the room…I even got pajama’s to wear at night.- Transportation: great options nearby - subway, taxi, bullet trains.- Nearby Conveniences: ATM’s and shops in the Tokyo train station right next door, including a food court and Starbucks.Could go either way:- If you’ll be taking the subway a fair amount, it’s a great location. Although there is no direct entrance from within the terminal, you are probably no more than 300 feet door to door. A great home base if that’s your preferred mode of travel. The bullet trains are right there also. Do note that the Tokyo train station is fairly large so you may find yourself walking a bit to get to the exit.- The lobby lounge has a small, but decent, selection of cigars which they present at night. The prices aren’t bad either. If you enjoy a Cuban stogie, a good option.- It’s located in a business district so if you are looking to be in a more quiet or charming area, this probably isn’t the place.- Lots of folks at the lobby bar as well as a piano player and/or music playing throughout most of the common area’s. A good energy if you like that. If you are looking for more peace and quiet, then it may not be to your liking. The floors where the rooms are located are of course quiet.Con’s:- Noise: There was a little bit of noise in the AM from what sounded like the building itself. I think it was the wind and possibly the heat from the AM sun warming up the structure and causing some expansion, etc Nothing terrible, but if you are a light sleeper (like me), or not an early riser, it may wake you up.- View: My corner room had one window with a great view but the other was right next to an adjoining office building. Not a good view and I had to remember to keep the shades down to avoid giving folks a peep show. There may be better locations on the other side of the building (I was in a “xx35” room).- Facilities: The sink drained slowly because I think the stopper was out of adjustment. Also I had one ceiling light out. Neither were big issues at all, but it’s always nice to have a room that’s feels spotless in every way.","San Francisco, California","nuggets00</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",25,5.0

Excellent room size and all the amenities expected of the brand. Wet room particularly good. Tokyo really is a sprawling mass. Taxis are expensive for Asia so if you are so going to get out and explore the city, it is worth using the highly efficient train and metro lines so the hotel's proximity to Tokyo station is a huge plus. Marunouchi and the Imperial Gardens are all a 10 - 15 minute walk away.Not cheap!! Paid around 600 USD per night on a room only basis. The hotel occupies about six floors at the top of the Marunouchi Trust Tower so you benefit from some very impressive views. That said, I was starting to get irritated with having to change lifts to get to my room - the lift from the ground floor takes you to the reception and then you change to the hotel's internal lift - but that is the way things seem to be going in Asian cities. I would certainly stay there again.","Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","Jo A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</strong>",6,4.0

We stayed at the Tokyo Shangri-La simply because our other 5star choices were sold out - and had I not booked this immediately it too was sold out a few moments later. The location right next to the Tokyo Station is excellent - if the Tokyo Station is important to you. Should the Narita Express be part of your plans - this deluxe hotel makes a lot of sense. Other strong points: All the staff was wonderful, Breakfast was one of the best, the views - fantastic - being one of the taller hotels in the area. The only slight downside is the location. Location is entirely subjective - and all things being equal this is a great location. The High end restaurant was beautiful, however on this trip - a full meal there just wasn't part of the plan.

We don't like writing bad review but we still feel bitter about this place... so here you go.1. Check In The lobby area of this hotel is absolutely tiny and it is always packed with Japanese ladies visiting hotel's afternoon tea or large group of wedding guests. When we arrived there was absolutely no one to greet us. The reception was busy so we sat one of the only two benches and waited to be served. But some people arrived after us started form the line and the reception staff began serving these people first. We guessed they didn't see us... even so we just arrived from Narita carrying huge suits cases and directly sitting opposite. We felt silly that we have to queue to check in in such a small reception space ( and this is 5 star hotel). For our 2nd visit check in was even worse. We were hoping that we would be greeted like "" Welcome back Mr xxx how was your trip to Kyoto !"" but we were wrong. They couldn't even find our reservation in the system and they really dealt with us badly. Basically they said there was no reaervation under our name but if we want we could stay by making a new booking. ""Oh! you are lucky we still have a room"" We were annoyed since we had a copy of reservation confirmation but it wasn't good enough. So, we ended up showing the credit card bill!!! We booked directly from hotel website using advance purchase rate so the money was already taken a month ago. This was our worst checking in experience for travelling 25 years in asia. The reception staff were all cold, unhelpful, and unproffesional. They even couldn't find the record of us staying there 10 days ago. What they thought we were? Stupid forigners trying to have a free night in 5 star hotel? We felt very sad and truly regretted coming back to this hotel again. 2 Room Service  To cut the long story short, basically no one picks up tel during busy time 7:30-8:30pm One evening we were told by a girl who answered the phone that they were all out and that's why no one answered ( sounds like pizza delivery). We always enjoy in room dining at Shangri la but this endless telephone calling was so irritating we orderd less than usual.3 Poor concierge serviceWe requested to book sushi counter at Nadaman restaurant in the hotel but we were told the restaurant was fully booked that night. So, we asked the other restaurant recommendation within walking distance, and by surprise, they gave us the english floor guide of Roppongi Hills ! We were so tired that day and decided to have a look at Nadaman anyway..... well... we couldn't believe our eyes it was totaly empty. Only 4 tables were occupied and no one was at the sushi counter. Sushi chef was absolutely brilliant his smile really made our day. We stayed in the restaurant till 11:00 but it was empty all the time.  We have been telling our friends this Shangri la is nothing like other Shangri la in other asian countries where professionalism meets warm friendliness. After Shangri la we moved to Ritz Carlton and sadly the place was much better run, even so we like staying asian hotel chain while travelling in asia. Also the view from RItz was better in our opinion. But the best hotel during this trip was Okura. The place reminded us true Japanese hospitality. Next time if we want to stay near Tokyo station we want try Four Seasons or Peninsula. Shangri la is wrong end of Tokyo station. Anyway, we will keep using Shangri la in Singapore and Malaysia but never again in Tokyo.","London, United Kingdom","onigiri2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",77,2.0

Not the Shangri-La Tokyo. It felt like I was in a better version of home. Every aspect of this hotel was amazing! I will go through a couple of pros and cons for the sake of the people researching where to stay in Tokyo but just to preface, if you can afford it please consider staying at this hotel! Pros:Rooms: The hotel itself is very tastefully decorated. I really appreciated the high ceilings throughout the hotel (even in the elevators), which is a luxury in Tokyo. The rooms felt incredibly spacious. Every aspect of the rooms was carefully thought out, from the Nespresso coffee machine to the super comfortable pajamas and slippers that were provided. I especially loved loved the bathtub and the specious shower. The bed was also so so so incredibly comfortable. I slept like a baby the entire stay also because the sound insulation at the hotel was so good - you never hear running water or noises coming from any other room. Service: Service at Shangri-La was exceptional. I was very very impressed by the level of English of all the staff. What I especially noticed was how every member of the staff, from room service, bell to even cleaning staff had impeccable manners and always gave us a warm welcome.View: We had a corner room on the 35th floor and it was breathtaking. I could sit and watch the view all day. It was especially relaxing to look out into the Tokyo skyline while taking a relaxing bath. Cons: (I wouldn't say these are huge flaws but a few things that could be done better at the hotel, which didn't significantly diminish the quality of my stay). Location: Although the hotel is located very close to the Tokyo station, the station itself is a labyrinth. I took the Narita Express from the airport and did not expect to be so overwhelmed. It took me close to 30 minutes to find the right exit to the hotel and even once I found the right exit I wasn't sure how to get to the hotel. Although I heard you could ask the hotel to pick you up from your train, I would have appreciated more detailed directions on the website and better signage. Gym: I found the gym to be a little small. Because of this, it felt a little uncomfortable to have a staff member inside the gym. I felt like I was being watched!Room Service: I did not get a chance to try the breakfast buffet at the hotel (because I wanted to save my appetite for other food delights in Tokyo) but I did order the Japanese breakfast room service once and found it to be rather mediocre. But the service was excellent. All in all, I still consider this one of the best hotel stays out of anywhere in the world.","Bangkok, Thailand","CSW83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",99,5.0

We as a family enjoy venturing in new places and discovering the city's hidden treasures; the best way to do that is by foot / subway / train. Unfortunately during our stay, the Marunouchi Tokyo station was undergoing some kind of renovation and this caused a bit of confusion for us in the beginning. Otherwise, when you get your orientations right, traversing the station was very easy. Compared to Ginza, Shibuya, Roppongi etc. Marunouchi felt like the New York financial district had gone on holiday. Moreover we've discovered quite a good number of restaurants which are walking distance from the hotel; most especially a good Takoyaki stall a block away from the hotel. We were booked in the 33rd floor and the view from our room felt like we were living in the clouds. Our vacation became even more memorable because we were given connecting rooms between our kids, which made our stay even more enjoyable. Although we've stayed in other Shangri-La Hotels, the Tokyo service was different in the sense that it felt more personal and genuine; definitely one of our top ten hotel experiences.

Can't really fault it on a any front. We had stayed here as a group of friends in September 2013 on a holiday trip. Well located near Ginza, which is thee shopping destination in Tokyo. The service is impeccable. Most of my reviews on trip advisor always have the ups and downs but here I cannot come up any any complaint of any sort after our five days stay. The check-in was as smooth as silk-they had our room numbers and keys ready as we got down from our car. Every staff of the hotel knew my name, even when I was passing them at the lobby or the lift. I had requested for an early check in through an e-mail as we were arriving in Tokyo early and though we did not get an assurance in the reply, the request was fulfilled. The breakfast is excellent with the friendliest and most hospitable staff. My friends enjoyed the Japanese breakfasts, as for me I stuck to my good old English breakfast. Everything was perfect. The stinky soybean in the Japanese breakfast was loved by all of us. The Japanese restaurant is a must try. A pity, we did not try the Italian food. The bar is also excellent with a gem of a bartender. Can't remember his name, but thank you my friend. The concierge was more than helpful and walked the extra mile to make our stay almost perfect. They did everything for us, even running to nearby stores to arrange tickets for whatever event we wanted to attend. Cars were arranged in time, food reached in time in the most presentable manner, etc. on departure my colleague dropped his wallet in the car, I called the guest relations officer and within minutes the wallet came back to the airport. Thanks again. And yes, not a single problem with communicating in English with any staff, from house keeping to bell girls. Just a slight bit of a mention, if at all, was the check out took more than normal time, because I was checking out for all the rooms with payments in USD and card. I had requested for all bills to be billed against one room when checking in so that checking out would be quick but this did not happen and I spent about 40 minutes checking out, if not more. Would I stay at this hotel again? Yes definitely and recommend it to others as well. This was also my first stay at a Shangrila hotel, and if this is their global standard, then I will surely be looking out for this chain in my other travels.

Everything I needed was there daily without any need to call for service. TV, capsule Coffee machine, wireless internet, water, room temperature control that works. With a department store (with groceries and food at the Basement 1) next door and a convenient store at the entrance of the JR station, everything I need or may need is within reach.Being right on top of JR Tokyo station, it's a convenient 60min ride by the Narita Express from the airport. A short walk 5-10min and you are at the hotel.Make sure you print the direction guide from the hotel and have it in hand. The variety if food places inside the station distracted me and I walked around in circles for a bit, but it was good being lost for a while as you can see all the food that you can get to during your stay.The hotel is at the Yaesu North Gate Entrance past 2 Starbucks (along the walkway to the exit and up the escalator at the exit itself). Turn right at the entrance and walk past the convenient store and right again past a pizza/bar and you can see the ground floor reception slightly to the left in maroon (if I remember correctly). Go in and the concierge there will guide your to the lift. The main reception is on Level 28.If you have checked in past 830pm, most of the shops in the JR station will be closed. However, the bar downstairs and the convenient shop is open. More interesting are the all the food shops under the JR line starting from a short 5 min walk from the hotel.There's a whole stretch of them and about 15 min walk away is http://www.andysfish.com/. 15 min is esimated time after a meal and beers.

I contacted the hotel the day before we were due to arrive and gave them my bullet train details from Osaka. Such was their attention to detail, they requested our seat numbers so that they could be ready and waiting to greet us at the door of the carriage. We were met with a smile and the young gentleman took the large majority of our cases and navigated us through the incredibly busy Tokyo station. I know the station fairly well, but even so it was well worth asking for their assistance as it just makes it that little bit easier. From the bullet train (or shinkansen) platforms, it is little over five minutes on foot to the door of the hotel, if coming in on the Narita Express from the airport, the platforms are further away so it may take up to ten or so minutes to get to the hotel.Once in the hotel, we were greeted on the ground floor before being whisked up in an elevator to the reception on the 27th floor. Check in was swift and paperless - everything was entered onto tablets. Others have commented on the decor, and it really is as good as people say. Some very beautiful pieces of art, and it is shame that many (me included) just saunter on by without looking at much of it. Whilst checking in, our cases were already on their way to the room on the 33rd floor, and we were reunited with them a minute or two later.We had a ""Premier City View"" room, which is a corner room that overlooks both the station and the Marunouchi district on one side, and north Tokyo and the Sky Tree on the other. So far, it has been by far the most spacious room we have had in Tokyo, and was well appointed and very comfortable. The bed, as commented on by others, was extraordinarily comfortable, and once in bed and with the lights off, there was something magical about having the blinds up and being able to see Tokyo glitter away outside.Nothing was too much trouble, and every request was sorted with the minimum of fuss. Being a bearded fellow, after a few weeks of travelling my clipper battery had run flat. Within minutes of mentioning this, a transformer allowing my 220V clippers to be fully charged was delivered to the room. And every time someone came to the room, everything was checked and completely restocked in the bathroom (...the bathroom was marvellous - the ""usual"" hi-tech Japanese toilet, a rain shower, and a bath tub which afforded a view of the city).We did make use of eating options in the hotel. If you have access to the Horizon Club, the snacks and drinks are pleasant, as is the atmosphere. For an evening meal, we went to the Italian restaurant (Piacere) and were not disappointed. The quality was very good and the flavours and combinations were carefully thought about. Breakfast was also fantastic. A huge amount of choice and all of the highest possible quality. And should you not want to eat in the hotel, there are literally hundreds of restaurants and bars in and around Tokyo station, so you will not be disappointed.All in all, a very good stay, made so in no small part by the hard work of all of the staff. Being next to the station the location is fantastic and everything was a smooth as you would expect from a high class hotel in a high class city.","Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom","Naniwa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom</strong>",149,5.0

Because it's not a big hotel, it has a nice cosy vibe and the rooms are a decent size and comfortable and a great refuge to come back to since Tokyo can be frenetic. As it's a newer Shangri-La hotel, it also has a more restrained, modern decor that is less busy than some of the older Shangri-Las. Being located adjacent to Tokyo Station, it's also very convenient when coming in from Narita or other cities by train. However, as I always get lost in Tokyo Station, I would recommend informing the hotel to request that someone (usually the concierge) meets you at the train platform to lead you to the hotel.

There are comparable properties in most major cities, including other Shangri-La hotels, but this particular property stands out amongst the Shangi-La chain as one of their best properties, making it a serious competitor at the highest and most demanding end of the market. The rooms are nearly new, elegant in appearance and finish, staff appears to be fluent in english, and service is at the level expected of a hotel with a 5+ star rating.

This was my 4th trip to Tokyo and my 1st stay at the Shangri-La.Since the Tokyo train system is once of the best most people including myself prefer to ride the train that a car. My wonderful experience started with the hotel once I booked my train ticket from Narita station to the Marunouchi station. The hotel concierge explained that this station was large and challenging to navigate if your first time to that station. She insisted on meeting me on the train track and all I needed to do was provide my train number and car number. Upon exiting the train the concierge was dressed with a hotel sign waiting for me and to help navigate my way through the VERY busy station. I think we walked for approx 15 minutes just to get through the station as the trains traveling to and from the airport are in a different part of the station from the trains that most take around Tokyo. The crowd was also larger than normal because they had recently opened up that portion of the station after years of renovations and both tourists and locals were taking photos of the renovated station.The Shangri-La is a beautiful hotel and I was greeted with a smile from the front desk staff upon check-in and escorted to the elevator where I was met by the bellman at my room door with my bags. I had two twin/double beds but after a long flight and wonderful reception I was not complaining, nor did I complain at any part during my stay. The room was very nice and modern with a view of Tokyo. The meeting space this hotel has is amazing the ballroom doors have crystals in all the door handles and mirrors, simply beautiful.Breakfast was included in my negotiated room rate every morning and I ordered the same coffee and sparkling water the staff had it ready once I sat down. This again adds to the service that the Shangri-La and provides in making sure their guests are comfortable. I had high tea in the lobby lounge one afternoon, it has some great views of the city but high tea is expensive, keep in mind Tokyo in Oct was listed in the 5 top most expensive cities in the world. I often thought that I was the only one in the hotel on business as most people looked like they were only there to lounge and enjoy the view. None the less I would recommend a cup of tea or a glass of champagne while sitting back and enjoying the view. I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Tokyo on business or pleasure as the train station is less than a 3 minute walk (central Tokyo lines) and you can get to most locations via train including the airport.","Atlanta, Georgia","cazjamz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",25,4.0

The Hotel is located extremely close to the Tokyo station, which is so convenient (if you take the right exit). So it is easy to come here straight from the airport as the Narita Express goes direct to Tokyo Station. It is also a stone's throw away from Marunouchi area, which has nice high end shops, and lots of great restaurants for lunch (not just japanese cuisine) which was a relief, especially the Dean and Deluca close by. It is also very easy walking distance to Ginza area (20 mins) and the Imperial Palace Gardens (15 mins).We did have to wait a rather long time for the room to be ready, as my brother tried to check in early at 11:30, but we didn't get the room till just before 3pm, which was a little disappointing. The hotel lobby is actually based on the 28th floor if I recall correctly, which makes for great views once you are there, with a nice bar and a lot of people having afternoon tea, we didn't get chance to try that. The rooms are fantastic, contemporary and really big! Much bigger than we expected, and we were in a standard twin. The bathroom was the best, extremely comfortable with heated tiles in the shower / wet room. They also had the latest version of the special Japanese style toilets, I later discovered there are older ones, with less functions in other places and hotels.The views were fantastic , we were on the 33rd floor and the electric blinds were perfect for keeping the light out.

Not only was the wifi very fast but it was a totally seamless experience wherever you are in the hotel. No need to log in again when you change floors etc, you are just connected, Fantastic!In terms of downsides for this hotel therevare only two. Firstly, it is very expensive. If you can get a corporate rate then do as it helps save a bomb.

There's no logo on the building and even when you are right in front of it you still cannot see the entrance. It took me HOURS to find the entrance, which turned out to be underground. Friends of mine visited me in this hotel and even their taxi driver could not find the entrance for cars. Shangri-La should e-mail guests in advance and put a huge warning on their website about this entrance. Or how about a sign that is big enough to notice from a moving car?Once inside, this hotel is excellent and the car troubles are soon forgotten. Sublime service, impressing decor. The rooms are huge, luxurious and very comfortable. Reception is at the 28th floor, all rooms are above that so a nice view is guaranteed. It's the kind of place one would like to live at, instead of just stay for a few days.The only thing I did not like about the room was the Bose home cinema connected to the TV. The sound is American: big, fat and loud. It was impossible to switch to the TV's built in loudspeakers and therefore I preferred to watch TV with the sound off. It might seem like a minor detail, but since this hotel goes for perfection even the little things count.The location of the hotel is very convenient. It is a 10 minute walk to Ginza and a 5 minute walk to the imperial gardens. Shangri La is located above Tokyo Central station, which is an attraction on its own. There's lots of shops, including ""Character Street"" which is a huge collection of toy shops, puppet shops, TV memorabila shops and other such stores.The most important reason to chose this hotel over similar hotels is the train service. You can buy a ticket for the Narita Express train from the hotel. A friendly lady from the hotel walks you all the way to the platform.

Air-con efficiency was excellent, keeping the room lovely and cool. The bathroom was nice with a separate toilet. The shower was roomy and was 'rainfall' type, which was nice. Housekeeping service was excellent, as always.Bars / Restaurants:We used the Horizon Club Lounge most evenings for drinks, which offered a nice range of refreshments depending on the time of day. The breakfast service was good (which we also had in the Horizon Club Lounge). We had dinner one night in the 'Nadaman' Japanese Restaurant but I'm sad to report this was a slightly underwhelming experience given the price - the Nadaman in the Singapore Shangri-La is better, which seems strange.Overall:Another excellent stay. I'm very happy to recommend this hotel. It's pricey but it's quiet, understated and offers service levels most hotels can't get near.","Glasgow, United Kingdom","endofcity</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",150,5.0

The room had a bathroom with a rainforest shower, large bathtub and lovely view. There was a daily turn down.The bar on the lobby level was romantic and had a nice atmosphere. We had breakfast in our room once which was a slight letdown as they got our order wrong but they rectified this when we called them. During the stay the staff were consistently good and made us feel very special they do everything for you including calling the lift as soon as they see you. The hotel was in a good location for the sights and Tokyo mainline station. They took us and our bags to the Shinkansen platform when we left for Hiroshima and helped us book tickets - a nice touch as the station can be very confusing. They even kept one of our suitcases that we didn't need to take for the week that we were away.All in all a great hotel with attentive staff and an ideal place to stay if you are looking for 5 star luxury in Tokyo.","Winchester, United Kingdom","Lonrad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winchester, United Kingdom</strong>",44,5.0

This one is located near to Tokyo station. It means that you can take the Narita Express train to and from Narita airport in about an hour. Narita airport is 60km from the city and a taxi ride will set you back USD250. It is advisable on arrival to ask the concierge to fetch you from the train station as first timers may get lost in the huge train station.Tokyo station has multiple metro lines which means it is convenient to get to anywhere in Tokyo. You may want to get the NEX+Suica card at the airport allowing rides on Narita Express and metro lines in Tokyo.Tokyo train station itself has loads of restaurants in Kitchen Street. Daimaru department store is co-located at the train station and on the 12th floor there are about 15 restaurants. The street outside Shangri-La is called Sakura Dori as it is lined with Cherry blossom trees and is absolutely enchanting when the flowers bloom. Takashimaya is 5 min down the road. Ginza is 15min walk or one metro station away. Imperial Palace is walking distance.The standard room itself is spacious and spotlessly clean. Large toilet with all the necessary toiletries. Very beautiful view of Tokyo at night.We had breakfast every day in the hotel and both the Japanese and western dishes are excellent. I found Nadaman expensive and food so so. We dined at several Michelin star restaurants in Tokyo which were cheaper and better. Esaki, Ginza Toyoda and Kyubei are all highly recommended. It may be better not to include breakfast in your hotel package as there are so many cafes in Tokyo station which is just next door.Service as in the other Shangri-La hotels are always excellent. They booked all the restaurants for us and gave us maps, instructed the taxi drivers etc. Service is always polite, friendly. Service staff is always smiling.

If you’re lucky enough to stay here, you’re in for a treat.Location is great for those doing a quick over night or stop-over from Narita. It’s located right at Tokyo Station which is about 45 minutes on the Narita Express. Do be sure to have someone meet you at the platform as it is very poorly signed to get from the platform to the hotel. It literally takes 15 minutes to get out of the station to the foot of the hotel. Hotel is beautiful and a dozen or so floors of a tall office building. As the hotel lobby only starts on the 28th floor, you’re basically guaranteed great views from your room. Rooms are huge and very nicely appointed – best feature are the views and also the large oversized washrooms with great features. Loved the washlet toilet especially. Nice big flat screen TV with lots of international channels.Appreciated the free shoe shine AND the free internet – almost unheard of nowadays.Breakfast was excellent – choose Western or Japanese option and there is a buffet included of a nice variety of items.To be improved was the Japanese restaurant – was expecting something a bit more flash for the Shangri-La. I didn’t find the food was of compelling value to price. Also Lobby bar had last orders at 2300?! Overall, wonderful hotel and wonderful staff.","Singapore, Singapore","Andrew W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",277,5.0

After our first visit, we ranked the Shangri-La Tokyo as simply the best hotel we've ever stayed in. Hard to imagine, but after our second stay, we feel the hotel even exceeded those expectations. We upgraded from the completely amazing Deluxe room to a corner sweet - unbelievable. While the basic Deluxe room was wonderful, the corner room gave us sweeping views of Tokyo Bay and the Tokyo Sky Tree. But amenities aside, the unbelievable service and care from everyone of the hotel staff is what puts this hotel on the top of our list. One of the measures I use in evaluating a property is, was it a great value? While the Shangri-la isn't low cost, it IS high value. I feel you get everything and more for your money.

The rooms are classically designed with very good linen in the bed, even the pyjama which gets provided by the hotel has a very good quality and was extremely comfortable to wear. The bathroom was huge as well with a big window right next to the bathtub... fantastic lying in there and looking over Tokyo at night.I tried afternoon tea at the Lobby Lounge as well as room service and all food was prepared to perfection, nicely presented and served with a warm smile.

Right next to the Tokyo station which connects you to everywhere. Not to mention, Tokyo Station has lots of shopping and food places. I couldnt get out of this place everyday! haha! And Daimaru is also right at the station which has a lovely inexpensive food hall for takeaway. Lots of varieties and for people who are crazy over the Tokyo bananas, they have an outlet in the foodhall too!Service was immaculate - the staff all spoke perfect english and was very helpful. Very often, the 5 star or 6 star hotels do not give you a feeling of warmth. Yes, they are all pretty and perfect and the staff all professional. What Shangri La Tokyo excelled in was combining professionalism with warmth...they always had a smile and that smile was genuine. It felt like ""home"" when I came back everynight. This is what makes a hotel click! And the room...i can go on and on about the room!!!!! Most delightful! it was such a pleasure to stay in and sleep in. For the first time in my life, I actually wanted to stay in the room the whole day! My room had a lovely view overlooking the Imperial Gardens and I could even see the tip of Mt Fuji in the distance! The bed was so comfortable and the sheets were heavenly. Every evening, there was turndown service and it came with a different traditional Japanese snack each time. And I loved the bathroom! Like all Japanese hotels, the toilet bowl came with all the different buttons and functions...it was a clever toilet bowl! It opens up automatically everytime you walk near it and it closes on its own too! Japan technology! haha! But what I liked most was the shower cubicle with the bathtub in the shower cubicle. It had a huge rain shower, and keeping the rain shower on while you soaked in the bathtub was absolutely therapeutic!

Located right next to Tokyo station which is great for Shinkansen and other JR services including the Narita Express (the hotel offers a ""guide"" service to get you to or from your train which if youve not been to Japan before you'd be well advised to use). The Shang occupies the top floors of an office block (as do the nearby Four Seasons Marinouchi and the Mandarin) so the views are good. Minor quibbles: my paper didnt arrive first day and I had to ask for extra shampoo when I ran out....so not a lot to complain about! I didnt eat in the restaurant so can't comment on the food. Good as it is I think the Mandarin in Nihonbashi just has the edge, and the Peninsula has a better bar and is just as good otherwise. Service at the Four Seasons is even better. And the Conrad just feels 'cooler' and has a fantastic restaurant. But all these are great hotels so probably best just to pick the location that suits you or go on price. I havent tried the new Palace Hotel yet or the Maranouchi Hotel, and the Tokyo Station Hotel is just re-openning after renovation which might be an interesting pick.

The bathroom was large had a rain shower and regular shower, with a great selection of toiletries. The room had the level of comfort and quality of contents that you would absolutely expect of a 5 star hotel.The difference for me, however, was in the quality of service. Just outstanding. Nothing was too much trouble, and everything was done with a willingness to please. We had great concierge service with help on tickets for the Sumo and restaurant advice. We left the “Do not disturb” light on one day: but they were there to service the room as soon as we returned and switched off the light. Club lounge service was very attentive and non-intrusive. It did take almost an hour to get two cocktails on room service the first night, but they called to apologise and to advise that they were running late. Some of the best service I have ever received.The hotel is in a great location, right on top of the main station and is therefore a great base for touring and visiting Tokyo. For the level of service and quality of the facilities, for me it also represented value for money. We enjoyed our stay at the Shangri-La, and it has my complete recommendation. I would not stay anywhere else on a next visit.","Billund, Denmark","Peter_R_Smith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Billund, Denmark</strong>",212,5.0

Located right next to Tokyo Station, we came off the Shinkansen train and within about 5 mins we were going up (in an extremely fast and sparkly lift!) to the reception and lobby on the 28th Floor. From the moment the door staff greeted us by name (how did they do that?!) to entering lobby we had already fallen in love with the place. A efficient check-in meant we were in our room (#3535) within minutes along with a complimentary bottle of delicious sparkling wine as gift for our honeymoon. The room has the wow factor from the moment you walk in - the view over towards to Tokyo was stunning and was even more lovely in the evening! We sat staring out of the windows sipping our wine for quite a while! The bed was huge and ridiculously comfortable and meant every night we had a great night's sleep! It was very easy to make the room as light or as dark as you wanted with the variety of switches for the lights, blinds and curtains - nice little touch thanks to technology. A large desk with fast wifi meant it was very easy to make our friends jealous with many photos of where we staying! The bathroom was also great - bathroom and shower room, large sink and vanity area (with great lighting for putting on make-up! and also one of the best toilets ever!! Automatic lid, flush, seat warmer, you name it it had it. The concierge was GREAT - she booked us tickets to Kabuki, Sumo, confirmed our train booking to Narita, made dinner reservations for us as well giving us information about Tokyo and getting around. Her service was amazing and greatly appreciated. They also advised on the Tsujuki Fish Market and organised a taxi to be ready for us at 0345 so we could make it to the Tuna Auction (not that I wanted to leave the bed!). Service from all of the other Front Office staff was also friendly, polite and professional without being cold. Housekeeping standards were very high and you rarely saw them to say thank you!! We were very sad to leave (they kindly gave us a late check out as our flight was not until the evening) but two members of staff escorted us to the NEX platform and helped us with our bags, which was the perfect ending touch to an amazing stay. Thank you to everyone, we hope to come back one day.","London, United Kingdom","Helen G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",26,5.0

Arrival is a bit disorienting as you enter below ground level and the lobby is on the 28th floor. The hotel occupies several floors above the 28th, and the result is the room views give everyone a specatcular landscape right at your feet. The lobby bar benefits from this view, as does the well appointed fitness center, complete with a pool on the 29th floor. If you are looking for open courtyards and wide open spaces this isn't your place, but then again Tokyo probably isn't your type of city either. If you want a smart room with all the bells and whistles, attentive service and good food, all with a world class metro view, then come on in. The concierge is very helpful to meet all needs, which is often key in a city like Tokyo which can be challenging for foreigners. The location is central to everything, and easy walks to the Palace, Ginza, Tsujuki Fish Market. Rooms are spacious and well designed.

With so many top end hotels to choose from in Tokyo I initially did not have the Shangri-la as my first choice but between being offered and excellent rate and wanting to be next to Tokyo station I booked the Shangri-la.I am very pleased to say that the Tokyo Shangri-la totally beat me expectation and has made me look at the chain in a new light. From first impressions all the way through to the end of our stay we were made to feel at home and the hotel went out of its way to make us feel at home. After a 12 hour flight in to Narita and the train in to Tokyo station we were greeted by the bell staff on the train platform (a great friendly service) and escorted to the hotel. This complimentary service is invaluable after such a long flight also Tokyo station is a maze with multiple exits.My only small complaint is the Shangri-la lacked a buzz, it’s not a big hotel and being based in an office block made the atmosphere a little sterile. Its neither small enough to be a boutique hotel nor big enough to be a big hotel and hence lacks atmosphere.Pros:Hotel designRoom sizeGreat serviceMeet and greet at Tokyo stationFurnishing qualityAverage:Breakfast quality Medium size hotel that lacks the buzz.Location is good if you want to be near Ginza, business district or Tokyo station.

I love my family but WOW was it fun to relax here alone -- I felt like I was in a sanctuary.Warning: if you want to see Tokyo's sights, probably a better thing not to stay here. Because you will not want to leave the tranquility and sheer and total perfection of service that permeates everything from design to housekeeping to advance technology in the rooms to the amazing food to the spa (the best treatments I've ever received and in the most luxurious spa rooms).The hotel is on top of a skyscraper -- don't let this put you off. It is many floors of lobbies and spa and restaurants with the rooms above this. All rooms have a tremendous view a la Lost in Translation (which was filmed at the Hyatt -- but same type of view). Here are some suggestions if you are going to stay here:1. Insist on a room with a view of the Royal Imperial Palace where the Japanese royalty live. If you are lucky, and the clouds disperse, you will see Mount Fuji as well. You will also see the main train tracks in the foreground -- fantastic full view of Tokyo.2. Book a full spa treatment. The staff will sit you down and go over your needs and give you a type of test to know how to best work on and with you. I was dubious but it ended up being the most amazing treatment I've had at any resort -- or otherwise. They start with washing your feet and move on to massage, facials, etc. There is a shower in your massage room and it is beyond luxurious3. Enjoy the heated toilets, the lit dimmers and the window shades in the room. Sounds strange but it will totally effect how comfortable you can feel. Every single switch in every single room, no matter complex, worked perfectly. Only the Japanese!4. Make sure you get club access. They serve a happy hour spread that is divine -- all the top-shelf alcohol and Champagne you could dream of plus delicious food both hot and cold. You barely need dinner after this. CONSNone.

In fact, if you like to walk, you could walk to Ginza (the main shopping district) and if you felt more adventurous, probably an hour's walk to Akihabara (electronics district) and Asukasa Shrine (touristy ethnic place for shopping / sight-seeing) and the new Tokyo TV tower.The luxurious fittings and fixtures, the customer service, and the food was great. Ofcourse, all this was at a price that was incredibly expensive. But the room was stunning and big, and the bathroom had a really sophisticated automatic toilet.

The nearest train station is Tokyo station which is about 5 minutes walk from the ground floor entrance (‘Yaesu North’ at the train station). We arrived from Haneda airport via airport limousine bus which costs US$11/person one way. We were told by the hotel that there was ‘complimentary pick up service’ from the bus stand. We were expecting a car to pick us up but instead we met 2 hotel staff dressed in bright red uniforms who took our heavy luggages and escorted us to the hotel which was about a 10-15 minute walk away (i.e. they pulled our luggages through the busy CBD streets all the way to the hotel). There is a simple reception area on the ground floor where you need to take the lifts up to the main reception which is on the 28th floor.The hotel has luxurious interiors with crystal chandeliers cascading over a descending staircase, plush furniture, soothing jazz music coming from the bar and that lovely scent omnipresent in Shangri-La hotels. It definitely takes your mind away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo in the streets below. The hotel staff were very polite and friendly and check-in was fast. Though we arrived at 1pm they had a room ready for us as we had requested for early check-in. Although the staff who checked us in showed us to the lift, there was no one to help bring our luggages to the room.We had a standard room on the 33rd floor and stayed for 2 nights. It cost us US$685/night with daily breakfast included. The room was huge for a standard room and offered views of the Tokyo train station below and the skyscrapers. We were lucky enough to see Mt Fuji on a clear day. There was no traffic noise whatsoever. The interior of the room was luxuriously furnished with two comfortable single beds and a small lounge by the large window which had automated day and night blinds. There was a large flat screen TV, free wireless internet, working desk and fully equipped mini bar with tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom was excellent with a separate wet shower area/bath tub and toilet stall. You could see the bathroom from the bedroom through a glass wall with an automated blind for privacy. However, if the bedroom is dark and the bathroom is well lit, you will be able to see the person taking a shower although the blinds are down! The rain shower was huge but I would have preferred stronger water intensity. The turn down service was nice with bookmarks, comfy bathroom slippers and pyjamas! They even had Japanese style robes in the drawers which were really comfortable to wear. They also provided a couple of fruits on our first night. Room service was expensive. I tried their chocolate fondant cake which was average as the middle part which had the chocolate did not ooze out.We had our daily breakfast at Piacere which offered stunning views of the city. A very modern and classy restaurant. For the breakfast buffet, you had a choice of either American, Chinese or Japanese breakfast set (one serving) with the buffet service only comprising of pastries, juices, soup and fruits. Service was excellent. I also tried the foot reflexology at Chi The Spa which had great service and transports you to another world of peace and tranquility with soothing music and massage oils tailored to suit your needs.The hotel also allowed us late check-out at 3pm on our departure day and helped us to store our luggage until we returned. Overall, I recommend the Shangri-La for its large rooms and luxurious and comfortable accommodation. They can improve on going the extra mile to provide more personalized service. At times it felt like there were too many guests coming in and out of the hotel and the staff couldn’t remember that you were one of their guests. The location in the CBD might be a tad far away from the main areas (about 20 minute walk to Ginza) but the Tokyo metro station is a 5 minute walk away.

I went to the Park Hyatt which I also considered to stay and I would say pass that. It out of the way (other than the rooftop bar to boast.) The added plus about Shangri-la is that it is next to the train which is very key considering taxis are extremely pricey!The only thing I would say is it isn't the best view eg. the entire skyline of Tokyo.

Makino-san, with whom I had been corresponding via email regarding the matter, actually recognized me when I was checking in and greeted me by name and told me if there was anything at all I needed to just let them know. They purchased my return train ticket to Narita airport for me, and would have guided me to the proper platform as well, if I had needed the assistance. And every single morning when I walked by and every single evening when I returned from work they greeted me with enthusiasm and asked me how I was and if there was anything they could do to help me. I went out shopping every evening and each time they hurried to help me with my bags and to call the elevator for me and would help me all the way to my room if I needed it.The room was stunning as well. Tastefully decorated and not to mention enormous. There was plenty of room for everything, a very comfortable desk for me to work at and I must say I loved the heated toilet seat with bidet attached as well. Every little luxury I could think of had been provided for - comfy slippers, a turn down service every nice, fresh bottles of water each day - and if I needed help with anything and called the front desk, they always greeted me by name and helped me immediately. I slept soundly every night and they had obviously also thought about sound-proofing the room somewhat, because I never had problems with noisy neighbors or getting woken up by slamming doors, which I often have with other hotels.I can't think of a single bad thing to say about either the staff or the hotel.

A really excellent hotel but, with the value of the Yen as it is, its desperately expensive. My room cost US$450 per night for a basic room - not a club floor room. Dinner for three in their ""ordinary"" Italian style restaurant cost US$500 for a basic meal including a pretty ordinary bottle of wine.Having said that and seeing that somebody else was paying for my stay, it is hard to fault this place. The room is perfect - everything works, all possible amenities are there and all you could want is available, in perfect working order. The health club/spa/pool is pretty small and basic but remember this is a city centre, business hotel so don't expect more - its always empty anyway so why make it a big feature.There is also a shortage of F&B outlets but again, with 5,000 restaurants and bars just outside the front door, why try to compete - more fool me for eating in their restaurant and spending US$500 - my tip? - just go across the road and eat better for 10% of the price. Having said all this, you pay for what you get and as long as you don't mind forking out the readies, this place is as good as it gets.

I am yet to find fault. [The closure of the hotel after the earthquake was a cause of some concern however people all react in different ways and it's unfair to fault human nature.]Standards of customer service are already high in Japan, but I have come to understand that the Shangri La Tokyo completely redefines that high standard. There is not a moment that I do not feel very well looked after, that the staff are genuinely focused on ensuring guests are 120% comfortable and that every need and request is taken care of. When dealing with any of the staff it feels like talking with a caring family member, a discreet butler, a close friend and personal concierge all-in-one. I have been to 6-star resorts in places like the Maldives to Venice, 5-star diamond properties in every continent, and stayed at some of the most extravagant and prominent hotels of the world. Many times I have felt I never want to leave but in my passion to try as many places as possible I rarely return to the same hotel twice.

Many of the newer hotels are very comfortable and elegant but for my main needs, the Shangri-La is the best. Two main reasons:1. the location is unrivalled. An entrance to Tokyo Station, the functional centre of Japan, is moments away. And if I draw circles around the office locations where I usually have meetings in Tokyo, the ShangriLa is the closest of any hotel to to their intersection. It is easy to sneak back to the hotel for an hour or two's downtime in the middle of the day. And the lifts speed you quickly from street-level to room in a fraction of the time required in some of the other tower hotels like the Park Hyatt or the Ritz Carlton.2. it's discreet and unfashionable. The lobbies of flashier hotels nearer to the ""action"" (ie Roppongi), like the Grand Hyatt, get clogged up by excitable hordes of irksome Tokyo newbies - for example, young hedge fund analysts waiting to be indulged by their brokers - whilst the ShangriLa exudes calm and dignity. I recommend the station-side rooms that look right down on to the Shinkansen tracks.

It was not cheap but was well worth the experience. When we got into our room, we were wowed by the fantastic view of the city through the floor-to-ceiling windows (we were on a high floor). Not to mention curtains were electronically controlled with day curtains and night curtains. The 5 star experience has you feeling pampered in every way. (Not like some hotels which claim to be 4 star but then when you enter the room, you feel like your home is more comfortable and better finished.)(+) The room and bed was incredibly plush and furnishings top-notch, and the TV was either the largest or second largest we've ever experienced in a hotel room(+) Luxurious bathroom with sliding outside partition, and option to use the overhead shower(+) Business centre had 3 or 4 computers with free internet access. I was able to print my maps for my next driving trip with no fuss(+) Professional, impeccable, excellent service from bellboys/bellgirls to reception staff. The bellgirl did not expect/want a tip but we gave her anyway.(+) The hotel has a free service which we used on the day we checked out - where the bellboy would escort us with our luggage to the train station. Although the JR station was not very far away, it was a confusing walk where you had to change elevators on different floors and walk through some areas under construction. Am sure we would have gotten lost if we tried to walk there ourselves(+) Close to Tokyo JR station and Daimaru. Central location in Tokyo(-) Not really a minus, but because the hotel is relatively new, and it is inside the Marunouchi Trust Tower, it is not very obvious from the ground floor how to get to the hotel. The sign which says Shangri-La is placed at a strange position in our opinion. Didn't mind taking the lift to the reception floor which was on the high floor, as they had staff downstairs to help with luggage.","Singapore, Singapore","Oon_JS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",5,5.0

I am admittedly not the biggest fan of the chain, but that was until I stayed at the Shangri La Tokyo. The layout of the room is suspiciously similar to the Conrad Tokyo, yet with a look and feel that is decidedly Shangri La and a final product that is spacious, comfortable and really makes sense. The over-sized chaise longue along the window made perfect sense for watching the sun rise over Mt Fuji or the lights of Tokyo come on during dusk. One night I sat there after a conference call watching the bullet trains sweep in with a bottle of bubbles and it somehow felt perfectly natural. The desk offers 2 choices of chair - one for those who need to work, and one for those who like to kick back while on leisurely phone calls. For a business traveller having a 'working' desk is critical and this point hasn't been ignored by the Shangri La. Each room comes equipped not just with an iron but also with a steamer, and more than a few other technological mod-cons like themed lighting, remote controlled blinds and the latest in washlet toilet seats. The in-room internet is free and is the fastest I have experienced anywhere in the world!!The Italian restaurant Piacere has some of the most authentic Italian cuisine in the Metropol, with staff who as skilled as David Copperfield in that they are so attentive you barely need to request anything and it's already being handed to you, while at the same time managing to keep out of sight. There are so many gems on the menu that you're best to come hungry and try the set menu which lets you savour an appetiser, 2 pastas, a main and a dessert for 10,000 JPY. For a budget traveller this may not be the cheapest Italian you can eat in Tokyo, but take a bite, close your eyes and you'd swear you're in Sicily! The lobby lounge was comfortable although nothing to rave about. The gym is cosy but considering there is a lap pool alongside it (and that you're at Tokyo station where space is a premium) it feels more than adequate.What impressed me most about this property was the staff. Clearly the staff are trained in a very different way from other properties and that's something you will notice the moment you approach the ground floor entrance doors. In the period of 30 minutes after checking in I had housekeeping picking up my shoes, room service delivering dinner and the porter delivering my bags, each of whom asked me before they left ""is there anything else I can do for you?"" In each instance it was asked in such a way that I felt they really did care, and wasn't just something they were each told to say. Such phrase was to be repeated many times during my week at the Shangri La, so much so that as I checked out and was asked for the last time if there was anything else I would like, I almost asked them to book my next stay.","Singapore, Singapore","LuxeTravelerHK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",438,5.0

Our room was on the 31st floor and had views out over Tokyo station and across the city. The proximity to Tokyo station is a real bonus, as was the proximity of the running route around the Imperial Palace (ask the concierge for a jogging map). The staff were all extremely friendly and professional and their service was faultless. The only thing to note is that the Shangri-La doesn't feel quite as Japanese as some of the other big hotels in Tokyo - that's not a criticism, just an observation.

We have a lot to master!! A very informative and extremely polite Mr Kohei Makino ( Horizon Club Manager ) took great pride and effort to make our stay ultra comfortable, even to the point that his manners and services even took him through the very busy train station lugging our luggage to help us board the train to return back to the airport, not once but twice due to a cancelled fight, and due to it being a long Japanese weekend, and being that most accommodation throughout Tokyo was booked out after our departure. Mr Makino made some extraordinary measures to place us once again in the hotel, even when the hotel was booked out!! !! Impeccable service truly, there was no complaints from us and we felt like we where wrapped in a very friendly family bubble and didn't want to leave!!

Its our first time to stay at a Shangri-la. We normally stay at Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton hotels.The Deluxe room was probably one of the largest rooms we've ever stayed in that's not a suite, which was a surprise since we've always heard Tokyo rooms are smaller in comparison to US hotel rooms.We also thought it was one of the most quiet rooms we've ever stayed in. Our room was on the 34th floor facing the Tokyo station tracks below, but could not hear the trains at all. Also in most hotels, by around 8am you will hear housekeeping cleaning noises, but we never heard any noise from them nor did we ever see any housekeeping cleaning carts in the hallway. It was so quiet and with the black out shades, we actually over slept one morning and didn't wake up until 11am!Everything was state of the art, all the lighting and window shades were electronic. If you don't want to be disturbed, there's a button you press by the door. But if you forget to turn it off before you leave, your room will not be cleaned, which did happen to us once. But all you need to do is call housekeeping and they will come and clean it right away.Service was flawless. Everyone were extremely friendly and polite.One thing that would have been nice was better detailed direction posted on their website on which exit to take out of Tokyo station. Tokyo station is so large and has many exits. We had to ask a station agent to direct us to the right exit, which is the Yaesu North exit. Go to your left when you exit and you will see the Shangri-la hotel sign just a few steps away.We liked the location of the hotel. Its more of a business area, but there are still plenty of shops and restaurants close by and Ginza is only a short walk away. With Tokyo station just below, its easy enough to take the subway to farther away places. Its walking distance to the Imperial palace and East garden.We had a wonderful stay and would recommend this hotel.","San Francisco, California","emsf29</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",17,5.0

And it’s the Shangri-la. Opened barely one year ago, this hotel quickly established itself as the new yardstick for luxury hotel standards in Toyko.After hearing lots of buzz about this hotel, I decided to try out just to see how it measures up. I did not go with high expectation. Past exposure to Shangri-la hotels and my preconceptions dictates that I am expecting a hotel that caters more to the masses with room rate that’s enticing to those seeking mid-tier luxury, that will offer a grand and large lobby but mediocre rooms, service that are efficient but more impersonal and business like. Wrong Wrong Wrong. This Shangri-la really surprised me. ArrivingI arrived by taxi right after I had checked-out from the Conrad. As the hotel is so new, the taxi driver was confused. Even his GPS was not showing the hotel’s location. Fortunately, I had a map with the hotel name in Japanese. The hotel is located within a high rise office tower. The ground floor ( arrival lobby ) is on the small side but opulently decorated with large crystal chandeliers and plush carpeting. Sort of like arriving in a very nice mansion. Upon arrival, bell hops quickly took care of my luggage. Check-in was quick. I was escorted to the room and the staff briefly demonstrated the room features. RoomThe room I had booked was a Premier Corner Room with a spectacular and un-obstructed view of Tokyo skyline ( looks even better at night ). All the latest in-room tech is there, including side table power panel with A/V and iPod connections. A large 42” Sharp Aquos high definition LCD TV outfitted with a Bose sound system. Electronic curtains and mood lighting and the minibar even decked out with a Nepresso coffee machine. Now, the design of the room might not be very groundbreaking. But the comfort factor in this room is off-the-charts here. Starting with the huge King Size bed. If ever there is a hotel bed where it literally made me difficult to get up, this is the one. The mattress has just the right firmness, the high thread count linens are sumptuous and of superb quality. Large goose-down pillows and an assortment of pillows. Next the bathroom. Decked out in posh marble and the finest of modern bathroom fittings, this bathroom has an advance electronic toilet with proximity sensor and a host of automated features. The large walk-in shower cubicle has an oversized rainforest shower head that gives one of the best showering experience. Water pressure is good. There is a platform bathtub with a view, and to round things up, a high definition in wall TV. Other commendable aspects of this room is that it’s whisper quiet. The hotel wasn’t far from the Tokyo train station and yet, there is no noise whatsoever. The switches and lightings and other conveniences are all at the correct place where I wanted them. The in-room tech is not as flashy as that of the Peninsula but it works. One feature I discovered is that I could playback high definition videos from my laptop directly onto the LCD TV with the cablings provided. Only nitpick is that they should have provided an iPod dock instead of cablings to connect my iPod to the in-room music system. The room itself is a testimony of up-scale luxury. Everything thing in this room is of very high quality, from the décor to the in-room fittings right down to the accessories provided. Even the in-wall switches are clad in leather. This is a room that has very high wow factor along with providing supreme comfort. Seriously, only the best hotel suites in Hong Kong can compete with this and no other hotels that I have tried in Tokyo can measure up. Common AreasThe hotel is distinctively boutique in nature. It only have about 100+ rooms and the smaller, more intimate lobby is unlike the usual Shangri-la grandness, more subdue but still very beautifully decorated. There are only two restaurants and a bar in the hotel. The Italian restaurant serve contemporary western cuisine for lunch / dinner and morning breakfast. The breakfast is good, with nice selection of pastries and other breakfast goodies though I wish there are more selection. The other restaurant is the Nadaman Japanese restaurant, a restaurant chain often associated with Shangri-la. Tried their teppanyaki dinner and it was spectacular. Using only the freshest ingredients and cooked to perfection by the resident chef right in front of me, it’s a wonderful culinary experience of a lifetime for me. Keep in mind even by Tokyo standards, the price is very expensive, but it’s worth every cent. The hotel also have a Spa, a full size and well equipped gym and an indoor swimming pool that have spectacular views of Tokyo skyline at night. ServiceThe service at Shangri-la is fast, efficient yet gracious. Nearly every request was immediately answered. I believed they actually provide a floor butler at each floor because it’s literally seconds after I put down the phone when someone will show up at my door with the things I requested. Another major plus point about this hotel is the English proficiency of the staff. I understand that English is not a first language in Tokyo and most hotel staff I encountered during my previous visits in Tokyo have difficulties understanding more complicated request and very often, I have to repeat many times. In the Shangri-la, based on my experience, everyone from the waiter in the restaurant to the door men have a workable fluency in English which makes things much easier for me. Overall, service is just exemplary, right up there with the very best. LocationThe hotel is located in close proximity ( ie 5mins walk ) to the Tokyo station, the main transport hub of Tokyo. From there, it’s just a subway ride away from most popular destinations. Near the hotel there are also an assortment of department stores, shops and restaurants. Conclusion The Shangri-la Tokyo is now my #1 favourite hotel in Tokyo, over-taking the Peninsula which used to be my favourite. If I were to return to this city again, this will be my first choice accommodation. It’s pure indulgence and first class luxury all the way. For all these, one is expected to pay lots of Yens, but then, you can’t expect to get a true luxury hotel experience by paying peanuts. Highly recommended and I am pleased to award it my highest rating of 5 / 5.",JAKARTA,"BENLEE123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>JAKARTA</strong>",775,5.0

There is a complimentary concierge service to meet you when you arrive on the Narita Express and there is a good reasons for this. Like all other stations, Tokyo Station is huge and the signage is not always tourist friendly. Coupled with some construction work, I am pretty certain I would have been wondering around for some time if not met by Etika, whose very good English and friendly manner put me at ease after a tiring trip. Please remember to call the hotel ahead with your coach and seat number.The hotel is quite new and the rooms are possibly the best I have had. The view was great and facilities more than ample with a coffee machine, DVD large HD TV, numerous gadgets and of course the famous toilet. Service was very good and significantly better than some of the more average services I have had in other Shangri-Las. The pool and gym looked nice with complimentary attire, but I had no time to use them. The complimentary wifi was probably faster than most hotels I've lived in, and that includes paid wifi services.The rooms were all located from the 30th floor upwards so there was no noise from the streets.If I have any complaint about the place, it was the air conditioning which was inadequate to counter the searing heat, so I found the thick covers to be a touch hot and had trouble sleeping when I was there.Location wise, the hotel is in the central business area so it's fine if you're there for work / business. Otherwise don't expect the lights, noise and excitement of Shibuya or Shinjuku.I found the breakfast to be limited and very expensive even by Tokyo standards. There were much better local choices in the smaller restaurants in the streets behind the hotel (turn right at entrance, go down the path and cross the main road) which is what I came to Tokyo for anyway. Food in Tokyo Station itself was ample, but the restaurants were crowded and more expensive. The food section in the adjoining Daimaru is worth a visit to stock up on goodies to bring home.The concierge service was very good and they were helpful in helping me find my way in the confusing subway system. If you're going back by Narita Express, I recommend you ask them to buy the ticket for you and escort you back to the platform.On the whole this was a wonderful experience and while it wasn't cheap, you get what you pay for.",Kuala Lumpur,"PeterFong</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>",0,5.0

I stayed in rooms on the 33rd (3 nights) and 35th floor (2 nights) - both were deluxe rooms with a king-size bed (remarkably comfortable), very spcaious, with a panoramic view of th city from the top and packed with amenities including a WC in the bathroom (separated from the bedroom by a glass wall, with a switch to lower blinds) with a control panel ! Service was extraordinary, with the staff very helpful and extremely friendly. A Golden Circle membership (free) gives you 50% off on breakfast, and for a city as expensive as Tokyo may be well worth considering. The breakfast spread itself could be a lot wider - seemed very limited, and not only because I'm vegetarian! While I had a negotiated company rate, I understand room tariffs at Shangri-La have fallen in general, making the hotel a viable option for all travelers to Tokyo, and is clearly one of the best hotels I've stayed at while travelling overseas.","Mumbai, India","Anuj_Mithani</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, India</strong>",369,4.0

This was my first trip to Tokyo and I only speak phrasebook Japanese (at best). The pros (there were no cons):Unfortunately, we timed our holiday at the height of summer with its humidity and temperatures that hardly waver from day to night. We never felt any of this inconvenience in the hotel. Our room was large, fully appointed and very clean. Nothing was left to chance from the L'Occitane toiletries, to the fully array of toiletries, to the special electrical appliance recharger bay. There were both kimonos and bathrobes as well as pyjamas.I love to work out on holiday (!!) and the gym and pool areas are perfect. There is no charge to use these areas. There are only 4 or 5 machines plus weights. But the big plus is that all sporting wear is available to hire for free. It is all Nike sports gear. The pool is 22m long and the water is tested every hour or so. Then there are the changerooms. Full spa, sauna and the usual including a secure locker for each guest.We dined at both restaurants. Once again, perfect service and attention to detail. We had a buffet breakfast at one restaurant and an Italian meal at the other.The laundry service was exceptional - right down to our items all being pressed and packaged in rice paper with pot pourri to keep them fresh.When booking a restaurant for you, the concierge will provide you with a map to get there, a letter to confirm your booking as well as a little card to explain the hotel's address should you get lost on the way home or need a taxi.Free wireless internet throughout the property was also greatly appreciated.There is a deli at the station and a short walk to supermarkets.The relative cons (for tourists):Relate only to the location of this hotel. It is in the business district and some may find that this doesn't give you the 'real Tokyo' experience. I loved the peace and quiet of the hotel to be honest and the fact that it was an escape from the city.However, the tourist information centre is very close to the hotel entrance and it is very helpful.Thanks for a wonderful stay and I hope to return again.","Sydney, Australia","sydneyshopgirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",46,5.0

Although our room overlooked the Tokyo train station (as well as the Imperial Palace), the soundproofing meant we heard nothing and had great sleeps. The buffet breakfast is the best value that I have ever seen and as such, we ate there every morning. I have no criticism worthy of mention for the Shangri-La and would say that after years of travel at some of the world's finest hotels, this was amongst the best and would return without hesitation.

After browsing TA for our choices, we settled on Shangri-La, and we couldn't be happier we did.We booked the Bay View Deluxe room (I think that's what it was called) which sat at the corner of the 33rd floor with a stunning view of the Tokyo cityscape and Imperial Gardens. The room itself was wonderfully spacious, with a large queen bed, comfortable couch, good-sized desk and a 42"" flat screen TV conveniently placed for easy watching from bed or desk (though not from the couch). The bathroom was lovely, with a rainfall shower stall easily big enough for two and a separate inset bathtub adjacent to a window with another stunning view of the city (we used the tub regularly and the view at night while soaking therein was fantastic).The hotel's location is good, in that it sits in the middle of Chiyoda-Ku and a ten minute walk from the beautiful Imperial Gardens. What was great, however, was that the hotel was a fifteen-step walk from Tokyo Station, which meant going anywhere in the city or out couldn't be more convenient.The staff was incredible, from the front desk and concierge to housekeeping and room service. We received great recommendations for places to shop and eat, and on our departure the head concierge and a porter actually raced through Tokyo station with us, hauling our bags for us, to make sure we wouldn't miss our Shinkansen to Osaka. The level of dedication to service blew my mind, as none of that was at all expected.My caveats to this great review are:1. Such great treatment comes with a stiff price, but considering how we were treated I paid it with a smile and gave everyone I could find a tip on top of it.2. The hotel food, both room service and the Italian restaurant at lobby level, were not spectacular in general but poor considering their prices. Luckily, if you're staying there you're in a city with more restaurants per block than any other worldwide, so why are you dining in anyway?All in all a fantastic hotel and I hope to stay there again whensoever I fly back through Tokyo.","Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","BSSAUD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jeddah, Saudi Arabia</strong>",0,5.0

This hotel is in a fantastic location, right next to Tokyo station although for first timers trying to find the hotel after getting off the train was a bit of a challenge and requires more signage directing you to the hotel. It also has a Daimaru department store next door, as well as many other convenience stores nearby. It is not cheap, but then nothing is in Tokyo but I considered that for value and location, Shangri-la beat the other options. It is also close to Ginza and Marunouchi (lots of restaurants, shops, cafes), and as mentioned adjacent to Tokyo station.The service was first class and could not be faulted. When I checked in I was taken by the Guest Relations Manager directly to my room for the check in process and everything was explained to me. She even gave me her business card.The room was enormous, exceptionally well appointed and comfortable and I could have spent all my time in it, had it not been for all the sights to see in Tokyo!!The bathroom was amazing and included a fantastic electronically controlled toilet which meant that you did not have to touch anything as it sensed when you were approaching the toilet and raised the lid and flushed automatically then closed the lid. A shower with rainforest shower rose as an option and bath were located in a separate large ""room"" and a vanity with extensive amenities including a special set for women. The room included Shangri-la pyjamas, robes and kimonos and slippers. Instead of an iron there was a steamer which was a very good idea. Electronically controlled day and night blinds in the main room as well as in the shower room, as well as mood lighting options.Linen was superb (as would be expected) and there was a full range of L'occitane toiletries available plus a range of other items such as a hairbrush, mouthwash and razors, toothbrushes etc.I had breakfast in the restaurant once but felt a little uncomfortable being on my own and surrounded by mostly Japanese couples and families!!The fitness centre was small but reasonably well equipped with several cardio machines, free weights and an integrated weights machine which was somewhat complicated to set up for various exercises. It certainly would not be very efficient if there were several people wanting to use it. There was also a very nice looking pool beside the fitness centre.

Many will tell you to stay in Shinjuku or Shibuya, but Nihonbashi, where the Shangri-La -conveniently located next to Tokyo station, as mentioned, which allows for easy day trips outside the city, or even within the city on the JR lines or Tokyo subway line-less than 10 minute walk to the great shopping area of Ginza-the area is a business area so generally seems a bit more upscaleService:Wow - just awesome.The concierge service was outstanding - I called the concierge ahead of time to ask if they could book us into one of Tokyo's famed Michelin 3 star Japanese restaurants for a special occasion, and if they weren't available, to try some 2 stars that they would recommend. This isn't a typical request, and is a fair amount of work, but they did so without hesitation. They called all the 3 stars AND a few 2 stars, and gave us options for that evening... all within a few hours. When we arrived, they had already prepared envelopes outlining the details of our reservation, directions, etc.The maid service was also great with a few nice touches, which may not seem like much, but really put the hotel a notch above. For the turndown, they leave on BOTH night stands a new bottle of mineral water with a fresh glass every night. They also provide nice Shangri-La pajamas (which they will fold on the bed - and provide you new ones if they can't find the ones you wore.) Just nice touches.A number of the staff in the lobby even made a point of seeing you to the elevator when you left the building (the lobby is on the 28th floor) just so they could bow to you as the doors closed. Totally unnecessary, but just typical of the service you get here.Rooms:See photos attached. Big rooms even not in a suite. The shower is gigantic. Wall mounted flat screen with BOSE speakers. High ceilings. The blinds can completely shut out any light when closed. 5 different settings for the lights. You name it, it had everything. And everything (blind control, lights, toilet) is automated. The toilet has buttons for whether you want both seats up, one seat up, or both down, and automatically raises the top lid when it senses motion (and closes it when there's no motion). What more can be said - this is a great hotel that we would recommend to everyone. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat. And having stayed at other hotels in Japan on this trip (where we paid almost similar prices for nowhere near the quality of the Shangri-La), the value for your money is there without question.

Upon leaving the train, we turn to our right and saw the sign 'Yaesu Central', but there was no 'Yaesu North' exit anywhere , as advertised on the Hotel's website. So, we walked towards this Yaesu Central exit, turn to our left and finally found the right exit near the Daimaru Departmental Store. From here, turn left, walk straight and turn left again, its another 1-2 minutes slow walk to the Hotel's somewhat nondescript ground floor lobby. We then arrived on the 28th floor check in area. This is a classier area, styled with elegance and alot of thoughtfulness. The receptionist lady was friendly and courteous, however, the procedures to get checked in seemed somewhat slow to two weary and tired travellers. We booked the lowest room category, the Superior rooms, and was assigned room 3121. This room, being located near the corner of a walkway, is both spacious and really quiet for a good nights sleep. Everything was new and high tech, however, there was no mood lighting as with the case of the Peninsula Tokyo which we had stayed last year. The clear glass Bathroom comes with a nice tub, huge overhead Rain shower and a standing shower. Curtains can then be drawled to ensure privacy. But alas, the bathroom door is also in clear glass, so when my mum showers, I cannot use the wash basin area, since it was adjacent to the Bathroom. The single wash basin is huge, however, we would prefer two smaller basins to one large basin. Toilet wise, in a separated cubicle, is also rather high tech. However, whenever one walks near it, the toilet seat cover would automatically moves up, creating some noise when one visits it late at night, and this might disturb the other sleeping partner. The other gripe was the expensive breakfasts - Continental & Oriental, both at 2,700 yen each, European 3,500 yen and Japanese, 3,900 yen! Since we are no breakfasts people, we didn't dine at the Hotel. Our twin beds, was, very comfy and spacious indeed. Curtains and blinds are all automated, huge flat screen TV right in front of the bed and beside the wash basin. Writing table also serves as our breakfast table, which was nice! There was even daily complimentary mineral water, tea and coffee bags. On arrival, we even get a plate of yummy chocolates! Both pyjamas and yukatas are also available in the room, what a thoughtful gesture! The two female Conceirges at Reception was ultra friendly and extremely helpful! They even helped to book our train tickets to Nikko with no extra charges, print out tour and travel info on Nikko without us even having to ask for them ... really touched. And oh yes, they all speak very good English! Everyone was really kind and helpful to us, calling for taxis whenever we needed one at the Basement level. All the good points as mentioned above, with the Hotel's superb location, just next to the Tokyo Station, is every weary traveller to Tokyo's dream! Our favourite Tokyo hotel to date, the Peninsula, even requires a short 5-10 minutes taxi ride, but this brand new Shangri-La is even better, doing away with the need of a taxi ride! A few tips about staying here - the nearby Daimaru has a wonderful food hall at its basement level and the subway ride to Shinjuku on the Rapid Chuo Line is only but a 4 stop journey (GO- platforms 1 & 2, BACK - platforms 7 & 8)... and do ask Receptions for the Subway map. As for Nikko, the cheapest option would be taking a cab (10-15 minutes) to the Tobu-Asakusa station, 1,800-2,000 yen depending on traffic. A normal one-way ride is 1340 yen, while a faster one is 2620 yen. Compared with the Tokyo station's JR Shinkansen, which will set you back about 5,400 yen, the Tobu ride is a better option. Moreover, the Tobu trains are non-stop, while the JR Shinkansen requires a change of train. All in all, we had a wonderful two nights stay at this superb Hotel. If we return to Tokyo again, we wouldn't stay anywhere else but here. However, we would love to try out their higher room category the next time. Hope there would be more surprises then?!",Singapore,"JChua</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",613,5.0

The hotel is situated on the top floors of an office tower, so you start the experience by entering a street level lift lobby that whisks you straight up to the 28th Floor. The staff greet you at every stage with a beaming smile and impeccable politemess.Check-in was swift and efficient and our room was ready for us, even though we were arrived a few hours earlier then the official check-in time. We were escorted to our 'Deluxe' room on the 35th floor and guided around the various features of the room.The room was absolutely amazing! It was a large, very well appointed room with a stunning view over Tokyo Station and the Imperial Palace and over to the skycrapers of Shinjuku in the distance. There was more than enough storage available, a huge TV with a BOSE sound system that also connected directly to a laptop or i-Pod should you want to play your own music through the system.The bathroom was out of this world with 3 distinct areas to it - the wet room with a huge overhead rainfall shower plus a deep soaking bath, the main washbasin was massive with a great selection of amenities and finally the show-stopper.....the hi-tech Japanese toilet! Fully automatic, right down to even lifiting the lid, the toilet was a real novelty with a heated seat and various heated water spray options!The beds were extremely comfortable with full bedside controls for almost everything in the room, including electrically operated window blinds.As our room rate did not include breakfast, we ordered room service on a couple of occasions and that was also perfectly presented. Basically, it is impossible to fault anything in this hotel!!! Obviously, a luxury 5 star hotel in Tokyo is not going to be cheap and the food and drinks were very expensive but that's normal in a city centre hotel.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a few days of absolute luxury and excellent service, in a central location handy for Tokyo station and access to the Tokyo Metro for getting around the city.","Aylesbury, United Kingdom","GDP747</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aylesbury, United Kingdom</strong>",39,5.0

Good views to Mount Fuji and into the gardens of the Imperial Palace. The service is impeccable, the staff cannot do enough for you. The rooms are spacious, quite business like rather than very sexy, but have everything you could want right down to the heated loo seat. Nice if small gym with very lovely spa, the hot tub is out of this world!!! In a slightly business-y area in terms of restaurants in the evening but there are good local places to be found and karoke nearby!!If you get invited to use the Horizon club, its fantastic and the complimentary snacks and drinks from 6-8pm is a fantastic way to start your night. The room service food was also very good, if not cheap!","London, United Kingdom","Oscarlake</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",64,5.0

The staff are excessively attentive and hosusekeeping service is the best I have seen anywhere. The hotel is well located adjancet to the main Tokyo station situated in the upper parts of an office block. As you might suspect this hotel does not do ""casual"" so expect fine meals and wines not casual quick snacks. The rooms are very well equipped and designed (with the curious exception of the washroom TV, commented upon by another reviewer). The Horizon Club offered an attentive service and I am grateful to the wonderful staff there for their assistance in arranging travel and helpful conversation each day.
