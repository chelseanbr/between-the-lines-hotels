We stayed for 5 nights. The water pressure in the shower was AMAZING! The room was plenty big for three of us. Nice view of the Tokyo Tower from the balcony. Convenient to the Akabanebashi station which was great for getting around.The downside was how expensive everything was in terms of add-ons and restaurants. There was a charge to use the pool, breakfast was over 100 dollars one morning ( and one of us had toast and coffee only), and our first night dinner in the Chinese restaurant was nearly the same.I would recommend this hotel based on the quality of the staff. The only reason I may not stay there again is if we choose to stay in a different area of town.","Loomis, California","allie8213</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Loomis, California</strong>",20,4.0

The room also had a separate toilet which, when you open the door to the room, the light comes on, the lid pops up, and the seat is heated! We had a problem with the air conditioning in the room as we couldn't turn it down and it was stifling and an engineer was sent in minutes to sort it. He actually had to go into the ceiling space and we left him to it and went for a walk outside. When we returned the room was back to normal and the temperature was much cooler. As we were part of a group we were allocated a separate dining area for dinner. The food was quite nice but not really satisfying as you only got little tasters of everything although we spent about two hours trying the little meals. There was no meat at all, but fish and vegetables and a glass of wine. We went up to the Panorama Bar afterwards to take pictures of the fantastic night views over the city.

After I said surely a chef can throw a slice of cheese on a burger he made a fuss over going to the kitchens to enquire like it was a huge deal. Food came - burger and club sandwich, delivered again by the unfriendly staff member. Both were awful. If we weren't so hungry after travel we wouldn't have eaten them. Burger was not fresh, was dry and tasteless. Club sandwich had such thick layers of mustard it was all that could be tasted.

You are bizarrely assigned when and in which section that you can swim. When deemed “full”, no one can enter until someone has got out. Raised eyebrows if you are perceived to be overrunning your “slot”. Woe betide anyone with a tattoo or a piercing as you wont be allowed in, which effectively rules out most of the UK population under 30.Also the management appears to be economising on the electricity bill as every other one of the downlight bulbs has been removed creating a twilight zone in the corridors and lift lobbies.","London, United Kingdom","stutt21</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",98,3.0

I enjoyed a pleasant stay of four nights on business.The hotel is moderate walking distance from Hamamatsucho station. It also has a shuttle bus half-hourly during the day; and other metro stations are closer if you want to navigate that system.English language issues are offen complex in Japan: no one at the front desk was fluent, but the staff were all very helpful. I arrived very early (8am) from an international flight - but they managed to get me checked into a room quite quickly. All the staff (and there are quite a few!) were excellent at all times through my stay.The room - mine was on the 30th floor - had excellent views, and was very well-appointed. An 'open plan' bathroom made for quite a feature: you could wash or shower whilst looking out of the balcony windows (or, close the screens for a private bathroom if you preferred). The shower and bath were combined in a spacious walk-in cubicle: but unfortunately, the shower head holder was broken, so it took some ingenuity to rig it up for a satisfactory shower.The room also featured complimentary Nespresso coffee, and high speed internet (both wired and wireless). Although I was on the 30th floor, I never seemed to have to wait too long for a lift/elevator.A downside is that although this is clearly an expensive hotel, they also charge a lot for extras. -- including breakfast, and seats in the 'sky bar' at the top floor! The gym/fitness center is also available at a considerable added charge. If like me you only need a minimal breakfast, I can recommend Starbucks, not too far away.

One was a silver service which was excellent. The impeccable service was really appreciated. They catered very well to our western tastes.The American style buffet was very good providing ample selection across the range of cereal, fruit, and cooked items.As we had dined in NaraMeguro for lunch we weren't overly hungry in the evening so didn't dine in the hotel at night. Rather we obtained food at a convenience store in the basement of the hotel - basement retail stores are a very common part of Tokyo hotelsReception and concierge staff were very helpful.We liked the fact there were two sets of lifts for the different levels of the hotel to take guests more quickly to their rooms. As there were a good number of lifts for each bank of lifts little time was spent waiting for a lift to arrive.As the hotel is set back from the road and has its own entrance it is able to accommodate a large number of taxis and tourist buses.It is located in the lovely Shiba Park. We were lucky enough to see cherry trees in blossom at the hotel although they were past their peak elsewhere in Tokyo.The cost of staying at the hotel is towards the upper end of the price scale but not untoward for Tokyo I believe.

While booking, it claimed to be a renovated room. We paid extra for this upgrade. Unfortunately it’s got the grime of a few decades. They would have had to reuse furnishings from the 1980s to make this place “renovated.” They clearly spent all the renovation money on the lobby. The cleaning staff is doing the best they can with what they’ve got. We chose the hotel based on the renovated room claim and city views. All three hotels we’ve stayed in had the same criteria and price point. The first two locations had exactly that. This place is so crusty and old I don’t feel comfortable laying in the bed. Or touching the floor. The bathroom is old and outdated. The toilet is at a tilt. It’s humid and hot. We had to keep the old fashioned blinds shut until the sun went down. The windows are so old they don’t have any real climate or UV control. The room was 77 degrees F for hours. The AC was set at 68 degrees F. It’s only 59 degrees F outside.

There are so many places to stay in Tokyo, so many different neighborhoods, it can be daunting to find the “right” place. I was very pleased with the Prince Park Tower. It is an elegant building that borders a park and is literally two to three blocks from the Tokyo Tower. In fact, we had a marvelous view of the Tower from our balconies. We were a party of three. We reserved one of the Garden Suites. It was lovely. The bedroom was huge and had a seating area which was great. The bathroom was also huge and well-appointed with amenities. (They provide pajamas, robes, slippers.) The second “bedroom” was a tatami-matted sitting room that they converted to our second bedroom by providing a futon on which to sleep. The added bonus was a second bathroom. (One note however – the second bathroom was only a toilet and a sink. No shower. No outlets. But nice to have.) There is a small entryway where you can leave your shoes. The entryway had a sink, fridge, Nespresso machine, mini-bar. Very nice.Because of the time we arrived (early evening), and because we were a bit dazed from our travels, we took an easy way out for dinner that night and went to the roof-top bar for a light bite. It is very expensive! Cocktails were $20-30 a drink. And we were assaulted with cigarette smoke (something we’re not used to in America). But the view was stunning – the Tokyo Tower is beautiful at night.We spent the next day walking around getting our bearings. The PPT is less a 10-minute walk to the Hamamatsucho Train Station where we were able to exchange our JR vouchers for passes. We spent several hours taking the loop train around Tokyo, hopping off and on to explore. As we headed back, we walked around the park that the PPT is situated on. It is chock-full of temples and sites and then walked to the Tokyo Tower. It was great. We dined out that night and left the next day to Nagoya for the F1 race.The staff at the Prince Park Tower are amazing. The check-in and check-out process was easy and didn’t take much time. They helped us forward our luggage to the next hotel. The women working there look so smart in their uniforms: very professional, very welcoming, very lovely. That they take pride in their work is obvious. I would highly recommend this place!","Denver, Colorado","Dvrnative</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",40,5.0

However, upon arriving, we were brought to a room that would've been a stretch to have been called ""renovated"". The only ""new"" components of the room was perhaps a new mattress, desk and one armchair. Everything else from the furniture including headboard, cabinets, drawers, bedside tables, the entire bathroom, and decor looked like it was stuck in the 90s. The sideboards were full of scratches and scuffs, and the wallpaper looked dingy and aged. It was a far cry from what I would ever call ""renovated"". Luckily, after some discussions with the staff, we were moved to an actually modern room - a similarly named ""Renovated King Room"", that carries the same room rate, and had a nice veranda, all new furnishings, etc. However, some parts were still left unrenovated. Particularly the tub (it was kind of stained, full of scratches and felt grimey from decades of use), the toilet with old controls (don't all Japanese hotels now have spiffy new toilets with multiple options?), a very old yellowing phone in the bathroom (they could've replaced this easily with a new one), and the room controls for temperature and curtains were also very old. Why only go halfway for a reno and not complete the rest? For the premium price you end up paying, you'd expect a premium room. It's like dressing up in a wonderfully fitted new luxury branded suit, but keeping on your raggedy old shoes you wore in high school. What kind of impression would this give someone? Probably wouldn't stay here again. You're essentially only paying for the view, nothing else.

I order breakfast at 7am the following day and after 50 minutes have to cancel as they couldn't manage scrambled eggs on toast with an orange juice (30 minute maximum wait was advised).I then have to wonder the streets for breakfast (nothing is open in the surrounding area until 9am) and get back to catch a shuttle to the airport. Prior to boarding there is a state of panic as I haven't checked out, even though they have all my details and registered my cards.I expect to stay in over 40 hotels this year and would be surprised if I have a worse experience by the end of 2018.","London, United Kingdom","soutstar1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",4,1.0

Good:- Nice rooms, nice views Bad:- English proficiency low across most staff- Staff don't seem to be on the same page in terms of what services their hotel offers- Service is terrible when considering the money you pay. Small example - Celebrated New Years in hotels Chinese restaurant. Most of the evening were pouring drinks by ourselves. Empty bottles not collected. I can go on for ages.- Queues everywhere. From check-in to breakfast. Just to give an idea - we were waiting for a table at breakfast for an hour. Only on the 3rd day (out of 4) of our stay a waiter informs us there is an option to ""book a spot"" in the queue and hotel will inform us by phone when it's our turn. Helpful information that would have been great to know at arrival.Let me just say that these types of queues I met only once in the Disney Resort hotels and back in 1980's USSR. Stayed in 3 other hotels in Japan and have not come across such waiting times.Having left the hotel I called up a few Japanese friends and got unanimously told that the Prince hotel chain is well know for the ""great"" service and they barely pass for 4 stars at best. Should have called them before booking.... In conclusion, we felt scammed out of our money, but more importantly I'm spending my first week of the new year complaining.P.S. - I'm sure a staff member from Prince Park Tower will reply to this review with an apology, their perspective on the situation and statement about how my feedback is very valued and they are constantly trying to improve.

Our 'basic' room was huge and far from basic. 14th floor with breathtaking views day and night. The bathroom was fabulous and full of free products and we loved the jet bath. The separate toilet was all automated and wonderful. The quality of the linens, towels and robes was heavenly. The hotel lobby is extra ordinary and gorgeous. Lots of lovely people on hand to help with everything including delivering luggage to your room. We had breakfast vouchers for a reduced price on different breakfast options. We opted for 33rd floor panorama buffet. It was an incredible buffet of high quality fresh foods of every kind. The service was delightful and friendly. In the evening there is a cocktail bar on floor 33 which has to be experienced !! Not overcrowded and carefully managed to make it feel private. It looks directly towards the impressive tokyo tower and is quite an unreal and beautiful experience. I wish we could have stayed longer ! Other things :Easy airport limousine bus directly to the hotel from Natural airport. No need to book and costs 3000 yen which is around £20 each. On return just book and pay at the hotel.Hotel Wi-Fi is fast free and uninterrupted. Subway stations are very close by and it takes around 20 mins to Rappongi or Shibuya.

Restaurants are about 5 to 10 minutes walk away as well. But in the biting cold of Tokyo evenings, we found comfort that the hotel has a Lawson's convenience store at the basement level. And it has everything. If you want to be a bit more indulgent, the hotel has a Steak restaurant and a Chinese restaurant as well. But do try the 33rd flr Italian Restaurant Brise Verte. My family and I had our breakfasts there and on a clear winter's day, it offers a stunning view of Mount Fuji. How awesome is that?!!! Also, the restaurant staff are very kind that they let my family sneak into the Sky View lounge to get a closer view of the Tokyo Tower.

This makes it peaceful- our room was great with an excellent view: at night we saw fireworks from the Rainbow Bridge- we had a delicious breakfast on the top floor with a wonderful view of Fuji San. The waiter in the restaurant was perfect.- I really enjoyed the relaxed lobby lounge. I could have spent a long time there. I saw people having afternoon tea, which looked wonderful and amazingly civilized.- The hotel has a “classy” atmosphereNot quite so good (for me personally)- the lobby seemed “stressed”. For example, my husband’s bags were temporarily misplaced. They were immediately found again when we showed a photo but after a long journey it’s nice for things to be “automatic”. There were a couple of other small communication issues too. Nothing major and of course it sounds like a “typical American” as I certainly don’t speak much Japanese!- Prices were high in restaurants, the gym etc.... but I suppose this is Tokyo- the downside of being in a peaceful area is that you are not close to “mall type” easy eating places (compared to other areas I have stayed in such as Shiodome). There are plenty of places to eat, but just not quite as convenient. Of course this is just a matter of taste.- subway is close, but the Yamanote isn’t and we couldn’t be bothered to wait for the shuttle bus so we did a lot of walking to stations and changing trains.

The views of the park, temple and tower from the room were superb and the lit up tower at night was a bonus. The attention to detail is remarkable right down to electrical outlets in the safe. Robe, pajamas, high quality beauty supplies, newspaper, etc. provided Downside was that you have to pay extra for the hotel spa facilities but with the bathroom being at a spa level it was not a big loss. Jacuzzi with a view! Breakfast was excellent. Depending on the purpose of your visit, the traffic in the hotel may be disconcerting to some. Being from a big city it didn't bother me. Service is good but not as personal as in some of the other hotels I stayed in during my Japan stay. Again, matter of choice.

A few small annoyances: There was no where to hang towels so you need to drape them over the tub-seems odd at a hotel of this caliber as does the severe lack of drawer space.

First impression of a hotel is usually the lobby. In other nice hotels we've been in the lobby is usually pretty opulent and warm. The Prince Park is a little different although no less impressive. I think this is intended as a business type hotel (although the room we got went well beyond that) however the business nature was indeed reflected in the lobby, which is mostly glass and metal with water features. It still makes quite the grand impression, but it is not the type of lobby you can comfortably lounge around in, this is not a complaint, as I said, it's very impressive. Staff were extremely efficient, polite and professional which is very typical of Japan, but staff here were even more professional somehow, they know their business and they do not mess around. We were upgraded to the premium level upon walking in and were told we could check in at the Club Lounge, so instead of standing around at the front desk we were able to take the elevator up to something like the 29th floor where a spacious and light seating area awaited us, complete with chairs and small tables, fancy food laid out, a variety of beverages and an astonishing full window view of Tokyo Tower. A staff member came up shortly thereafter and checked us in while we sat in comfortable chairs eating salmon hors d'oeuvres. This was a new and wonderful experience for us. We had access to this lounge for our whole stay, I believe. The room was unlike any other I've stayed in, very swanky yet super comfortable and very spacious especially for Tokyo. The overall feel was one of tasteful modern design and simple casual elegance. There was an area with a standing sink, partially enclosed in wood with a large mirror, and a counter with various soaps and lotions and such, where one could freshen up. This was in addition to the shower room, so one person could be showering and the other could be brushing their teeth or whatever in this separate area, which is a nice touch. Additionally, the toilet itself is in it's own separate little room. The front wall of the shower room was all glass, which added a swanky modern touch, so long as you're not shy and you could take in the incredible view whilst showering. Outside of the shower room is a spacious nook with a bench under a rod with hangers, a nice place to hang your clothes and such. The bed is huge and very comfortable, it was like sleeping on a cloud. Except of course you'd just fall through a cloud but maybe you know what I mean. It was super comfortable. One side of the room is pretty much all window with a spectacular view of Tokyo. There's a very small terrace you can step out onto, maybe just enough space for two or three people to stand, and you can feel the building swaying slightly out there, pretty cool. Easily one of the nicest rooms we've ever stayed in. There are 7 different restaurants in the hotel as well as a few lounges and a bakery. We only ate at the Japanese restaurant, Shibazakura, for breakfast and the sushi restaurant, Hamashiba, for dinner. To be honest, the breakfast was all right but we'd had a much better one at a ryokan up in the mountains, but the sushi...Ok, the sushi dinner is not cheap, however the level of quality is downright indescribable, the only word I can think of is ""exquisite"". I've never had sushi that good and may never again. Service was quiet, graceful and extremely efficient. Hands down one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. We also checked out the Stellar Garden Sky Lounge which was very cool for it's up close glowing night view of Tokyo Tower but unfortunately wasn't a place we could spend much time in due to the cigarette smoke. Definitely worth stopping in and getting a drink though. At the end of our stay the staff were, as usual, very efficient, helpful and informative about arranging our transport out of there. This was an absolutely perfect stay, one of the finest we've ever experienced. I felt like James Bond, I can offer no better ringing endorsement.","Seattle, Washington","David S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",24,5.0

Not having any experience of the city and what it has to offer this seemed nice and a safe choice. Getting to the hotel:We took the Narita Express to Shibuya which takes approx. 80 minutes and then the metro. I highly recommend sorting out your return ticket for the Narita Express immediately or the day before your going back. The queues can be super long and please allow for plenty of time for the trip to the airport! The Location:The location is not the best to be honest. Compared to what Tokyo has to offer, it’s in a very quiet neighborhood. And when you add the “resort”-feelting to it, it get even more secluded.  The Room:I was very surprised by the room, it’s a bit out of date but it was quite big. The room had huge windows that gave the room a more spacious vibe and gave a super nice view of the city. Ask for a room that faces the park or the Tokyo Tower! Unique details:As I wrote before, the hotel has a real “resort” vibe going on. They have a bakery and s small supermarket in the lobby. It also has some restaurants and bars as well. Good to know:The walk from the metro takes about 20 minutes. Not as close as we thought. What’s close by:Nothing exciting as a first time visitor. Luckily the metro is extensive, but I highly recommend living in the more busier areas such as Shibuya, Omotesando, Harajuku or Shinjuku. Customer Service:Very limited English skills, but very polite. Overall impression:The hotel is actually nice, if it was 1975.

Tried all 3 and all good. Only negative were the extra charge of over 2000 JPY (£20!) for the eggs benedict (if breakfast not included, this menu was over £40!!! A rather pricey breakfast for a regular dish otherwise elsewhere included) and the sometimes long wait (ok, about 15 minutes- long when on a tight schedule) for a table at the buffet breakfast, when lots of tables were available but just not cleared fast enough. However, the food and drinks were very good and the coffee nice and strong- with a choice of expresso, cappuccino etc.There is free wi-fi throughout the hotel.The metro is a short walking distance from the hotel making exploring Tokyo easy.

Whilst they store luggage after check-out until departure, the only option of a changing room and shower before what would be very long journey home for most travellers, is the showers at the spa but for a charge of just over 2000 JPY- a rather very expensive shower.

The bus times are shown by the bay.It is an imposing building, right by Tokyo tower, surrounded by embassies, a lovely park with a shrine, and 900 yens taxi ride to Roppongi Hills’ shopping and restaurant area.The hotel has a top floor bar ‘Stellar Garden’ (it isn’t guaranteed you will get to seat by the side of Tokyo tower) with amazing views of the city, a café and several restaurant. They are on the pricey side. To give you an example, on New Year's eve we stopped at the bar for one glass (not a pint size) of beer and one glass of sake with soda, spending 3847 Yens - £28 at the time of writing. (the table charge was 1020, and it was discounted because we were hotel guests). However, there is also a fantastic shop on the ground floor, which is like a Family Mart where you can get food, alcohol, snacks, drinks, pastries, coffee for your room, etc. If, like us, you have been in Japan for a couple of weeks by this point, you may wish to eat in your room for a change, so this types of shops are truly heaven sent. The fridge in the room is already full (and you will see the price difference between those drinks and the ones from the shop downstairs), so make yourself some space and use the fridge for your stuff.You can also take the free shuttle to the station, and explore the area around there: there are plenty restaurants and even an Irish bar, all at a more restraint costs, than in the hotel. Alternatively, once the shuttle drops you off, you are only two stops away from the main train stations (Tokyo, Shinagawa, Shibuya, etc.) and each of them offers food, food and more food.Our room had a huge window on two sides – pretty spectacular – though it meant that once the sun was up the room turned into an oven, and the aircon was not the most efficient (a definite downside). The bathroom has a large shower and a large bathtub, plus all the amenities. There is free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. The staff is great and efficient.The limousine bus transfer to Narita goes from the hotel, so you can get to the airport for 3100 Yens per person (if you still have your JR Pass use it to get on the Narita Express for free).They have an onsen/spa for an extra charge, a bowling alley and a karaoke room too. They organised a lovely countdown event in their private garden for new Year’s night with the guests being entertained by live music, sipping hot sweet drinks and releasing white helium balloons in the air at the bell– and given that there are no fireworks on the night, anywhere, it was a nice thing to do. After midnight you can then make your way to the nearby temples as per traditional Japanese custom. Overall it’s certainly a great hotel.","Dublin, Ireland","Trixter76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",18,4.0

I checked many sites and it was typically rated a 4 or 4.5 star hotel. I was happy to be so incredibly wrong. I got so much more, not less!! This hotel exceeded my expectations in every possible way. I actually preferred The Prince Park Tower Tokyo to the very expensive, well known 5 star hotel, I stayed at the previously. I loved the beautiful location, the wonderful breakfast, which was a combination of Japanese and western food. The rooms were quiet, impeccably clean, modern and spacious. The service this hotel offered could not of been better. It started off with exceptional customer service from Rosalie, who checked us in and walked us up to our rooms.

The upper floors offer some amazing views of Tokyo - including Tokyo Tower which is a block away. Overall its a solid 4 star hotel that primary appears to cater to the business crowd. The location is convenient to subways, a JR Train station, 20 minute walk to Roppongi and a 10 minute cab ride to the Fish Market or Ginza.Check-in: Relatively efficient - I had a King Panoramic View room - the ""panoramic"" views vary dramatically depending on the side of the hotel you face. Ask at check in or before for a room facing the Par, Tokyo Tower or Temple.Lobby: Not much of a lobby - just about 20 chairs scattered about the central core where the elevators reside and bridges over the water pool. There is a reasonable convenience store in the lobby with fresh pastries, snacks, gifts etc.Room: Overall, the room was comfortable - probably a shade under 400 sq. ft and wedge shaped - windows on two edges. The furniture looked dated as did the coffered semi-circular ceiling, however, the real King sized bed and sheets were very comfortable. It had updated lighting, electronic curtains and thermostat. The view from the 23rd floor was pretty good - I had the temples, park and some bridge in the distance. The Thermostat was set at 25 celsius, however, seemed cooler. Moving the settings up or down a few degrees didn't seem to have much of an impact. The room had a stocked mini-bar, safe, teapot with assort options, ironing board, desk, sitting area. English TV channels: CNN, BBC, and 2 others - limited options.Bathroom: Although somewhat dated (lots of black), it was spacious. Separate tub and shower (glass cube) with really excellent water pressure and super hot if desire. The standard ""Star Trek"" Japanese Toilet - with seat warmer and many ""cleaning"" options - don't press the wrong button - or be prepared for lift off. You have to keep the blinds drawn or you will be exposed while using the bathroom - or at least I couldn't find a opaque button like in their newer hotels.Restaurants: Tons of options on the upper floors or lower levels - all very good - excellent service - but HIGH prices - you can walk a few blocks and save 50%.Concierge: Under staffed - appeared to only have 1 on service at any time. Helpful with transportation options - but not so great with unique tourist requests. Seems to be more of a business focus at this branch.Check Out: Quick and efficient.Taxis: A cue waiting 24/7 at the front door. Uber ""Black"" is available in Tokyo, however, it is priced the same as Taxis - EXPENSIVE. No UberX or alternative cheap option. Cabs are about $7 to start the ride and go up quickly ($225+ from the Airport to Tokyo). Take the subway or JR railroad - the map looks confusing - but once you get the hang of it, no problem. It's Fast, Cheap and efficient.

Some of them were excellent where they will help you book restaurants. Some of them were a bit difficult to communicate with. However, the general impression I got from the hotel is that it's targeted towards business travellers. I was also not impressed with the Sky Lounge as it had a cover charge to sit with a full Tokyo Tower view.

With two kids, definitely go for the Panoramic Junior Suite which has a ton of space with two beds and a sofa bed. The panoramic views are just amazing and the suites are luxurious with a large bathroom. It became a great way to see Tokyo given its rather central location next to the Tokyo Tower, west of the Ginza/Tokyo station areas, and east of the Shinjuku/Shibuya neighorhoods. Its two metro stops away from Rappongi, and a few more away from Shinjuku and Shibuya. Would definitely recommend not staying any further east in Tokyo as being close to Shinjuku and Shibuya provides the most options for shopping and restaurants. A great service the hotel offers is also a free shuttle bus every hour to the Hamamatsucho metro station, which is connected to the Daimon station on the JR line, providing for access to the JR Yamanote line and day trips from there to places like Yokohama and Kamakura. Hotel has a store/shop inside and there is a Lawson's about 10 minutes away on foot. Lastly, the service at this hotel was amazing - staff were always polite and made you feel welcome.

We stayed to celebrate an occasion and the hotel staff took pains to make us feel special, including with a card and gift inside the room. The concierge service was very helpful in helping us make a dinner reservation at the nearby Michelin starred Tofuya Ukai (a short and pleasant stroll from the hotel). Unbeknownst to us, they had also notified the restaurant of our occasion and we were presented with a small gift at dinner. After dinner, we headed up to the hotel bar for drinks. One of my only complaints is the ""table charge"" at the bar. Completely understand the need for bars to have a cover charge, but suggest that it would be appropriate for this to be waived for staying guests, as it is at the Park Hyatt. After drinks, we returned to our room and ordered in room massages. Despite the late hour, two massage therapists were at our room within minutes. The next morning, room service breakfast was promptly delivered at the requested time, along with copies of English language newspapers. We had a lovely morning relaxing over breakfast in bed in our robes, before a very generous checkout time of 12pm. We stored our luggage while we did some sightseeing, and returned in the evening when we took the (half hourly) free hotel bus to the monorail station, minutes away. Throughout our stay, we enjoyed friendly service, small conveniences and a feeling of luxury. To address some of the criticisms I've seen on trip advisor - I agree that it would be good to allow guests to check in early if the room is ready. But I don't think this is a deal breaker and would not assume I could check in before an advertised check in time. The hotel was very happy to store our luggage before check in - although this process could have been more welcoming. It did feel like we weren't treated as guests until 3pm. There would be little cost to the hotel in applying a friendlier or more apologetic tone to guests who arrive early - and it would clearly make people feel better about it. In terms of location, yes the hotel is a bit further away from the hotspots of Shinjuku or Shibuya. However, the subway stations are conveniently located. We used our stay to step back from the Tokyo bustle and unwind, and to see a few things that were more convenient from the Minato district (for example, the hedgehog cafe in Roppongi). There are a lot of extra charges for facilities in the hotel - the pool, massages, bowling etc. But the hotel is also very competitively priced for the 5-star market. We got a very good deal from booking.com. I see the extra charges as meaning that we didn't pay for things we didn't use. If you do want to use the pool, or beauty and spa services, the extra charge for this is still going to place you way below the room rate for many other 5-star hotels in Tokyo. All in all, a good deal and a very satisfactory stay. ",,Boris7111334,43,5.0

I stayed there before and really liked it, so I booked 10 days on recent trip. I would say I have nothing but the highest compliments. I read a few comments about the staffs not speaking English, but I think that's mostly untrue. I interacted with many hotel staffs and with the exception of the room lady, everyone else spoke English very well. The price on the weekend was unusual high (600 plus USD), but 350 USD is decent given this area is at the heart of Tokyo having access to the subway and highway as well; yet, the hotel is inside a park, very quiet beautiful park. The hotel has 1 buffet style breakfast restaurant on the 33rd floor which I think one should try out at least once, or more if you have a free voucher. I saw many people had voucher so it is probably given with the hotel package; otherwise, it is 37 USD. Another restaurant on the same floor with better view of the Tokyo tower will charge 44USD/breakfast. One should also try the Japanese traditional breakfast down in the basement too. On the first 2 nights I was given a room facing the temple. I didnt like it so I requested the room facing the Tokyo Tower at night. It was so beautiful at night. I didnt have to close the curtain at night because the lights went out gradually. Also, dont forget to try out the tearoom. They offer English style tearoom with Asian Pacific deco/setting that I think quite interesting and different from the usual loud English tearoom.

Whilst the room was clean, tidy and well presented, and the staff professional, there were a number of issues with our stay. The first, which set the overall tone to our stay, concerned checking in. Due to our morning arrival in Tokyo, we arrived at the hotel before the advertised check-in time. In my experience as a frequent traveller, when this happens hotels usually try to assist by checking you in early if they have a room available. And if there isn't a room available, it's not an issue and I am always happy to wait until my room becomes available. On this occasion, the reception staff made it quite clear that our room was available and ready for check-in but because we had arrived early, if we wanted to check-in we would have to pay an extra charge. Otherwise we could wait until the advertised check-in time. With many hotel experiences over many years in a range of different countries, this was the first time I had encountered this approach to an early arrival. It was particularly galling given we were scheduled to depart two days later very early in the morning and therefore not staying in the hotel until the advertised check-out time. So, in effect, we were not exceeding the period of our stay in the hotel anyway. We chose not to pay the extra fee to check in early and waited until the advertised time. But the hotel's attitude towards early arrivals undermined its claim to be a five star establishment. Aside from this, we found the hotel services very overpriced - mush more than you would usually expect in a hotel, especially in a major city like Tokyo. A basic iced coffee in the lobby cafe costs over A$20 (ie. a not very tall glass of ice with coffee syrup and cream on the side). Use of the hotel pool required payment of an additional charge of over A$50 per person. For such an overpriced hotel, you would expect everything in the room to work and for the advertised services such as turndown to take place. The TV remote control did not work and had to be replaced during our stay and the turndown service never took place. Small things but they add to a picture of a hotel that purports to be something it isn't. Overall it was not a satisfying visit and I would not be choosing to stay there again. There are many better hotels in that class to choose in Tokyo.","Queanbeyan, Australia","Quinton C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Queanbeyan, Australia</strong>",8,3.0

Also because it’s adjacent to Zojoji Temple which creates a unique romantic panoramic view at the long window of some suite rooms in the hotel. The outstanding symbolic triangular high-riser of the hotel, though a little outdated in style, is almost as distinguishable as the Tokyo Tower which stands just some 200 metres from it. Yet, tourists to the Tower never get into the quiet zone of the hotel, providing a nice residential comfort for the guests especially during a morning or evening stroll at the tranquil park with these historical sites as backdrop.After a long queue for check-in, my twin room was upgraded to a Junior Suite because of the high occupancy I think. When I entered my unexpected large suite space I was attracted immediately by the uninterrupted Temple view just down my room, a rhythmic composition of traditional temple roofs and the greenery. The room deco is tentatively nostalgic in the mood with pale green wall paper and pine wood colour furniture. At the same time there are good coffee machine, large TV and sophisticated ventilation with the same effect of an open window.The security is rather strict, those who enter the guest room area must have a key card for access. Perhaps because of this and the limited number of rooms on each floor, the corridor out the room is always very quiet. Wifi is one of the fastest among several hotels I stayed at the same period. Choices of breakfast are abundant, namely Japanese, buffet and American. Although I accidently booked this hotel because of high occupancy in Japan at the time, I was surprised to find the high standard provided, gaining more confidence of the established brand of Prince in Japan.

The location isn't in the heart of Tokyo, but the subway is a short walk away and it is easy to navigate around the city. The staff are very friendly. Rooms are a little dated, but clean and have all the facilities required. WiFi is good. My room was high up, but didn't have a view of the Tokyo tower.

Although the hotel is walking distance to Tokyo Tower (a must-see attraction, especially at night), it is further away from city center. The hotel is in the middle of a business district which means there aren't as many things to do at night. The subway system is easy to navigate (with the help from Google Maps) and it took us about 25 minutes to get to the Ginza district and other attractions.

It didn't matter because just about everyone at this hotel spoke English, at least enough to help with any question that I had. They were also very kind and humored me when I tried to speak in broken Japanese. The hotel room I received was GIGANTIC by Japanese standards, and larger than most rooms I've had in cities like San Francisco. The bathroom was a work of art, and the automatic, high-tech toilet had so many buttons and options that I was amazed.I had no problems with the wireless Internet access in my room. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant -- do that at least once to experience the view from just about the top of the hotel. If you can get a table on the Tokyo Tower side, that's a pretty nice way to start the day. I believe the other option, by the omelette station, gives you a view of Rainbow Bridge. Speaking of the restaurant, the buffet has an amazing array of American, European, and Japanese offerings. I highly recommend the pastries and the guys making omelettes did them perfectly.We were at this hotel for a convention, and the convention venue was beautiful and conveniently accessible from the main body of the hotel. There are all kinds of shops and even a wedding chapel onsite. The convenience store in the lobby was very well stocked and open both early and late. There are a few train and subway stations nearby; we took the subway from Daimon a couple of times -- that is about a mile away -- and it was pretty convenient. If you would rather take cabs, there seemed to be a continuous stream of those available out front. If you don't want to eat at the hotel, there are plenty of small food shops within easy walking distance. The Zozoji temple is right next to the hotel and is worth a visit, especially if it is your first time to Tokyo.

It looks a bit like an apartment block from the outside, and not the most modern building in this wondrous city, but once inside the hotel has a luxurious feel and the panoramic rooms have what is surely one of the best views from anywhere in Tokyo. The hotel sits in a park so if your room faces the park you have an uninterrupted view to the whole of the beautiful Tokyo Tower (the one that looks like the Eiffel Tower), as well as Zōjō-ji temple and a full skyline of Tokyo skyscrapers. You could also see the SkyTree when it wasn't foggy. Our 'panoramic' room was very large and the marbled bathroom too. There are more luxurious hotels with more modern interiors in the city but you'll find it hard to find one for a similar price with such a view. I like the location of the hotel but some might not. From Akabanibashi station (5 minute walk from the hotel by the time you've crossed a busy road), on the Ōedo subway line, you can be in Roppongi in a few minutes, Shinjuku in 11ish minutes. For anywhere else useful though you'd have to change at Daimon and walk 2 minutes to get to the more useful Yamanote line at Hamamatsuchō. Roppongi has loads of shops, bars, clubs and restaurants but has a more international feel than anywhere else in Japan and isn't to everyone's taste because of that. You can walk there in 30 mins or so from the hotel. Near Tamachi and Mita stations you can find a street full of local restaurants for locals - didn't see any tourists and various restaurants are scattered here and there closer to the hotel - (just like any part of Tokyo). But Tokyo is all about its trains and they are a pleasure to travel on and quite fun - especially once you work out how the ticketing system works - staff at most stations will approach you if they see you struggling to work it out. The hotel appears to be used a lot for Japanese events including weddings - probably for the romantic view. I believe it does have a pool. We did not eat in the hotel. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. I would recommend anyone coming to Tokyo for the first time to book a few different hotels in a few different areas - but really from any one location you can explore the whole city easily by train - but don't forget they are not 24 hours running until midnight or 1am. The hotel helped us arrange a coach back to Narita Airport at the end of our stay at a reasonable price as we didn't want to drag our luggage through the streets and up and down into underground stations although that would have been cheaper. Was only disappointed to find the fact that the hotel-branded water in the room was not complimentary as I'd expected it to be.","London, United Kingdom","Matt W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",54,5.0

It is strategically located right in the heart of Tokyo city, about 30 minutes by taxi from Haneda International Airport, and only a short walking distance from the nearest subway station Akabanebashi (which links to other major stations such as Shinjuku, Tokyo Station etc)I found the hotel to be very spacious and the bubble lifts going up to the floors were really breathtaking. It has a nice garden/park just outside its grounds which gives a pleasant green lung-y feel as you walk or drive-in, and the staff are always so attentive and friendly. My spacious room had a nice view with a balcony of Tokyo city - (not facing the tower though) and the bed was a super-sized KING! Really unexpected for a Japanese hotel! The furniture though seemed a bit aged but well maintained and the cleanliness of the room is incredible!I had a choice of having breakfast either on the top floor or in B1 - but I preferred the one in B1 as it was in a very authentic Japanese Restaurant and they served breakfast set in a Bento boxes! Yummy!One thing that I also noticed, was the in-house store located strategically in the lobby - not only was it well stocked, but the items sold, from instant ramen to soft drinks and even some souvenirs were priced similar to any of the stores you'd find outside the hotel. Very reasonable! And the best thing it closes daily at 1am!I noticed there was a shuttle service provided to head down downtown, but I did not get to utilise it. Since the tube station was so nearby, it became my choice of transportation, apart from walking around on foot. If you were to walk say about 15 to 20 minutes, you'd pass an old temple and end up at an area near the Daimon Station where there are plenty of food outlets, some open till very late!All in all I would say that The Prince Park Tower Tokyo provided me a very comfortable home base for me to explore the city of Tokyo for the very first time.

So for a great portion of the day and night, and for a very reasonable price, you can pick up that aloe yogurt, or a latte, or a sandwich, or really delicious pastries.

If you walk, you can take a shortcut through the Hotel's East entrance on the South side of the Zojoji Temple or take a courtesy shuttle bus (one every 30 minutes) from the station but the bus stops at a couple of hotels on the way from the station (it is direct to the station from the hotel). Shibakoen Station (Toei Mita line) is right on the corner a 3 minute walk from the hotel's entrance as well. From there you can access most of Tokyo's subway lines and get just about anywhere conveniently, including Tsukiji.We originally booked a Corner King (which actually has a Queen bed) for 2 nights and asked if they had extra bedding or a rollaway when a relative unexpectedly visited with us. The hotel suggested that we re-book a Deluxe Twin Room which would have 2 twin beds and they would set up a third. The beds are actually slightly bigger than a US twin but still too small for 2 people and the room looked bigger than the picture. The check-in/-out was painless and the bed was Western but futon firm which was great. The free Wi-Fi worked pretty well, too.I would have given this hotel 5 stars for location and 4 stars as a hotel generally, but we are subtracting a star because the separate toilet room smelled pungently like urine. Public toilets in Tokyo were far cleaner and did not smell as bad as this tiny room. The fancy Toto washlet toilet has a disconcerting habit of opening automatically any time anyone walked by, which happened a lot since the toilet room was across from the shower/sink bathroom.","New York City, New York","HotAsianMama</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",49,3.0

The loos are something well beyond most western hotels - very high tech!! The service is excellent with very helpful staff who make such an effort to speak English. The downsides to pay attention to are few but notable - (1) the top floor has a bar with amazing views over the Tokyo skyline, but it is very pricey, there is a cover charge and my wife order a glass of champagne and was given a half glass. Not confined to this hotel, the Japanese still permit smoking in bars and restaurants and for me this is a real downer having enjoyed smoke-free dining and drinking in the UK for many years now (2) the buffet breakfast is very good but also pricey. There is no doubt you can eat and drink more economically elsewhere - there is a good bakery in the hotel lobby for example. The hotel is near a couple of tube lines and we found it very easy to get around the city from this base. The adjacent Shiba Park creates an oasis of calm in the midst of the City.

It's our first choice every time visiting Tokyo. The hotel is is a little bit away from the Tokyo center, so the price is very good and rooms are spacious. But it's actually just walks away from subway station, so is still very conveniently connected.The highlight of the hotel is its stunning Tokyo Tower view. Do ask for a high floor room with tower view, even if you need to upgrade your room, you won't regret it. The breakfast offers a choice between Japanese style set meal or continental buffet, both are very appealing, if possible try both. The hotel stuff is very professional and fluent in English, also they are extremely attentive and polite, typical Japanese hospitality. The hotel room is very modern and spacious, you even have a small balcony, which is not common in many modern hotels. The bathroom is top class with a large Jacuzzi bath-tub, one of my favorites.Will definitely recommend this hotel is anyone traveling to Tokyo and who wants to be fascinated.","Beijing, China","xyangt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beijing, China</strong>",58,5.0

The price of between 38000 and 70000 yen per night, depending on their availability ( but mostly their mood of the day ) is ridiculous high for a very average room, not even with a view on Tokyo Tower next door ( and this for their top rooms while from a number of lower floors you have magnificent views ). The lounge is really unacceptable and does not even deserve the name "" lounge "" , drink corner would be better. Compared to other hotels in Tokyo, at better prices , it is just a joke. So, whatever you decided, do not go for the premium rooms. The rooms are the same as the lower floors, just a few floors up. Breakfast at the lounge is inadequate to remain polite, the drink and cocktail service is near insulting to premium customers. At one time, this hotel was to be recommended, now, frankly, it is to be avoided. It should cost maximum between 20 000 and 30 000 yen per night. Everything over that is an abomination.

They provide all the ammenites that you need (i.e. brush, comb, toothbrush, japanese disposable scrub towel, razor, lotion, shampoo, makeup remover, nail file, etc.) They even give you daily complimentary water along with English newspaper. I had no problems with the free wifi. And there is a small refrigerator for you use. You just have to make room since the refrigerator is stocked with drinks and snacks that you pay for. Elevators were always fast and the included breakfast had options of either buffet or Japanese sit down breakfast. The breakfast vouchers allows you to use it for lunch at a set value. If it's more, you just pay the difference. It's about a brisk 10 minutes walk to the JR Yamanote Line Hamamatsucho Station and Daimon Station. There is a free shuttle bus that takes you there and back. The hotel is also close to the Shibakoen and Akabanebashi station. Once you go outside the hotel, you need to walk a minimum of 3-4 minutes in order to eat or shop. I say 3-4 minutes because if you walk outside the doors, you will not immediately see anything until you walk further. About 5 minutes away, there is a supermarket to buy what you need for your room. All the staff was very helpful and attentive. We used the bus service from Narita Airport (3100Y) and it's about a 1hr 45 min ride. As soon as we arrived, an employee came out with a luggage cart to whisk our luggae away to the lobby then to our room. If you are there longer than one night, you can opt to not have your room cleaned or serviced in return for a 1000Y voucher that can be used anywhere at that hotel.

We loved this hotel. Our bathroom had a window above the soaking tub that had the most magnificent view of the city. Check out the traveler's photos, you'll see some examples. The king sized bed was super comfortable and western-sized. The room was quite large, we were on a corner so we had an amazing view. Tokyo is spectacular at night, we were on the 32nd floor and it's really amazing. The hotel was clean, gorgeous, don't look down when in the speedy glass elevators :) Our floor was very quiet and the staff was very polite and helpful (as is the case everywhere in Tokyo that we stayed).The location was fine for us, we had been in the city for over a week by the time we had stayed there so we knew how to get around on the trains (which are super easy to learn, Tokyo has the BEST transit!); I would say maybe it's not the best place to start from unless you have your travel plans for the city fairly well mapped out, or if Tokyo Tower is a major attraction for you (it's walking distance from the hotel, it's cool - another option for a 360 degree view of the city.)This hotel is in the (or one of the) financial districts, there are some temples nearby but it's not in a visitor hotspot like Shibuya or Akihabara (Electronic City), and there's not a ton of restaurants around, but you can get around really easily so I'm not trying to dissuade anyone from staying here, just be aware that it's not like being in the center of all the action. Some additional travel info: We were leaving to return home from this hotel at the end of our trip, and the staff helped us with getting seats on a bus to Narita that picked up right at the hotel, it was TOTALLY worth the price and made everything so much easier - I think it ended up being around $40 each US dollars. I would highly recommend this. Also luggage delivery services from the airport to your hotel is the best and worth the cost. You do not want to be wrangling your luggage on a packed train, believe me.The hotel has a nice restaurant and a bowling alley! When we were there they served free American-ized breakfast on the 36th floor which is nice, saves time so you can hit the city and see as much as you can. Tokyo is beyond words, you could be there a year and not see everything. This hotel is really nice and an excellent option for a very reasonable Tokyo price.

About a 10 minute walk from the hotel back entrance, around the Zojoji temple, is the downtown Daimon area where you can find a bunch of restaurants. Our first meal was Ramen Thank, which was delicious! Highly recommended and English friendly too! The best thing about PPT was it's convenience to the subway stations. Most of the time, we used the Akabanebashi station, and from there it was easy to transfer to any of the other lines. Take a look at their pastry shop in the morning. They have fresh baked breads which are so good, especially the Maple Bread. I would definitely return here in the future!","Chicago, Illinois","tsleeps</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",14,5.0

Large room, very clean, a variety of soaps and towels, very comfy bed with a variety of pillows, large shower room with a shower and a bath tub, toilet in another corner of the room, a large walk-in closet, WIFI with no problem, TV with various channels Japanese and international alike, and quality coffee maker with tea bags.

About 10 minutes by taxi from Roppongi, one of the most busiest centers, for youngsters especially, in Tokyo, and about 10 minutes walk from Tokyo Tower. It is also close to one of the largest parks in Tokyo.The check in was very impressive and smooth. Not by standing at a reception desk, the way we do in most the world's hotels, but by sitting comfortably down in front of an hotel officer. I asked for a quite room far from the elevator but found out all the rooms are far from the elevator and all are quite. I didn't specify in advance that I would like to have a room facing the Tokyo Tower, but nevertheless this was solved very fast and I got the room 503 facing the Tower. What a beautiful site especially when the Tower was lighten up during December's nights! In fact, the staff as a whole were professional and charming and gave very good service.

I ended up in a corner room on the 15th floor with the Tokyo Tower in full view. The room is exceptionally large for a Japanese hotel, and incredibly well appointed, with a glass shower stall and separate jacuzzi bath, as well as a different room containing just the toilet (which is even more high-tech than the other Japanese toilets I have encountered thus far). Check-in was easy and simple. I was able to store my bag with the front desk easily, even though I arrived well before my check-in time, and I completed the paperwork prior to being given my room key. The hotel provided me with an adaptor for my computer and the service has been exemplary, if even a little overwhelming. A word of warning (and this should not be a surprise), but the cafe in the lobby is _expensive as hell_, and I'm assuming the restaurants in the hotel fall into the same $$$$ price range. Find yourself a Lawson's if you want to drink some beer in your room at night or have a snack.The hotel is situated just a block or two from the Tokyo Tower, which is neat to look at but seems like kind of a fool's tourist trap. Much more interesting is the nearby Shiba park, which has plenty of hooks and crannies to explore and is full of small statues, shrines, and places to discover, including an active Shinto place of worship. The hotel is not particularly close to any interesting stores or restaurants, but there are two subway stops less than five minutes away, and it was exceptionally easy to get to Shinjuku Station for dinner.I'd highly recommend this hotel if you're able to get a good deal. Great service, beautiful, huge, well-appointed room, convenient to the subway (although not much else).

I arrived early and the fact that no rooms were available was fine. But the staff were very intent on reciting the rules, storing my bag and getting me out of the lobby, with no suggestions about where to recover for the intervening 5 hours. Travellers don't arrive early at hotels in order to create inconvenience for the staff; we are hostage to airline schedules. I was checking in for business, for a week, but asking to use the (small) business centre was clearly an out-of-left-field request. It would have been great to know that the tea lounge is exceptionally comfortable; that the gift shop/boulangerie sells fresh baked croissants; that the basement houses a superbly equipped gym and a full size thermal spring spa (for about USD 25); or that there is a terrific massage service downstairs, alongside the nail bar and the esthetic salon. Once past reception the rooms are large -- if unrenovated -- the service is terrific and the French restaurant on the 33rd floor has one of the best-priced dinner menus in town. I agree that the hotel has a lovely 1960s elegance vibe. Watch out for the breakfast buffet on weekends -- the influx of wedding parties, tour groups and Japanese holiday makers means that the lines are long; it is a destination brunch spot. Location is fine if you are happy to use the subway. There are no shops or restaurants close by but the hotel has a surprisingly well-stocked mini-supermarket, so self-catering and supplies are at hand. My suggestion is that management sends the entire front desk staff over to the Excel Tokyu Hotel in Akasaka-mitsuke to get some training on smiling, personable, 'how can we make you comfortable?' service training.

Great gardens with walking/running paths surrounds the hotel. Zojoji Temple is right around the corner as historical site. Always taxi is available (730 Yen and up). In 10 days for my business spent equivalent of $400 for taxies which is not much considering multiple trips I had to take within Tokyo. There are close-by metro stations.Running in the early morning surrounded by Gardens were very nice. Due to time change, there were nights waking up very early and running in 4 am around the hotel, never felt unsafe at all. Overall Tokyo is a clean and my impression the place was very safe. The hotel has a decent gym and indoor swimming pool which was included in the room in my case. The Gym requires a long walk from the base of the hotel. The Basement has all sort of restaurants including Sushi, grill, steak house, tempura. Once I had Sushi dinner special for the hotel guests. Breakfast buffet I had in 33rd floor most mornings was great. For most rooms it may be included but not in my case which cost (I think) around $30, which is a great price for the great quality of food. Including hot and cold quality entries, some Japanese entries and soup.There is also small store in the hotel to buy pre-made sandwiches, drinks, beverages. Also has a great daily fresh bakery including croissants, some deserts, etc. Very good quality and not too sweet.I really like the hotel, modern, comfortable, very clean and very respectable and helpful hotel staff. If you are looking for a hotel in the middle of action, close to near by small restaurants etc. This is not the one. It is close to Tokyo Tower if you like to visit to see the Tokyo from birds eye view. The sound insulation is good but in night there was some street/traffic noise even though I was at 28th floor.

When we went to check it out it was miles away (walking underground for quite a while), then there was a sign saying people with tattoos will not be admitted. I have a tattoo of cultural significance and felt pretty raw about this! I understand that this is commonplace in traditional Onsens but feel that this sort of restriction is out of place in a hotel of this size, that caters to international guests.

Obviously the view speaks for itself (see photo). I only tried the restaurant Shiba Zakura and it was very good, although somewhat on the expensive side for my wallet, but again, the staff was very helpful and watching the chefs prepare the courses was a nice experience.Access to and from the hotel is perhaps it's only drawback, from Narita airport it takes bout 2h with the limousine buss (fare is 3100 yen) and it leaves right outside on the hotel grounds and makes stops at both terminal 1 & 2 at Narita. There is also a Hanada line. I found it more convenient compared to the railway with a train switch needed at Tokyo Station. As you probably have read elsewere, don't even think of taking a taxi, the buss will take the same time but for a fraction of the cost.If you can bother walking for ~10 min you can get to some of the more connected subway lines at Daimon (Asakusa/Oedo line) or Toranomon (Ginza line) otherwise there is the Akabanebashi station just outside but the Oedo line isn't the 'best' line when it comes to access to the main attractions.

I stayed for a week and found the property to be very livable.I took the deal which allowed access to the Executive lounge on the 33rd floor and this I found well worthwhile. The lounge is open for breakfast in a buffet style, tea / coffee refreshments during the day and then in the evening snacks and alcoholic refreshments all in a self serve format.The atmosphere is relaxing as well as being able to enjoy the views of Tokyo, including Tokyo Tower which feel like it is right outside the window. The room was well appointed with a toilet that had more electronic features than a Lexus. The bathroom was a good saize with both a shower cubicle as well as a bath with hand held shower nozzle.One trick worth remembering is that you can nominate to not have your your room cleaned and bed turned down for two out of three nights. They still take out the trash every day. You get rewarded with a JPY1,000 voucher per day which can be used in the hotel shops.The hotel is located in Shiba park, so there are no shops or restaurants on the immediate block.

The toilet was really hi tech - it opened when you entered the room! We got a real kick out of that. And flushed with a button on the same panel as the bidet options. And the bathroom was gorgeous. Marble, huge tub, powerful shower - maybe my favorite of the bathrooms we had on our Japan trip. Toilet was definitely the most hi tech of the toilets we encountered in all our hotels.It was very convenient to the train, with Akebanebashi subway stop very close and a free shuttle to the JR station and Daimon subway that was a little further away. (beware, the shuttle leaves exactly on time, to the second!) Even those were still very accessible without the shuttle by a 10-15 minute walk through a nice and interesting area with restaurants, grocery stores, coffee shops, amenities, and an interesting sense of Tokyo life in the area. There was a tranquil park around the hotel and a temple right next to it that were nice to view every day as we passed. There was also a bus stop nearby which I took one day to Shibuya. Very convenient to get anywhere you needed to go.Breakfast was absolutely delicious with a stunning view through floor to ceiling windows of the Tokyo Tower and surrounding skyline. But it wasn't included with our booking and was expensive so I only had it once during our 7 night stay. My favorite breakfast of the trip, including that at the Conrad and the Ritz Carlton Osaka. Definitely worth it at least once during your stay for the experience of the food and view. We didn't use the pool/spa facilities as they weren't included. Wifi was free and great. We had minimal contact with the staff but they were extremely polite and helpful whenever we did, and pleasant when we were passing.It had the vibe of being a ""business hotel"", at one point there was a big conference taking place downstairs for a phone company. It also seemed to be a wedding venue, or offer those services. Very bright and airy in the main areas and rooms. Muted cosy lighting in the hallway leading to the room, which gave it a warm, classy, burrow-y effect. Very serene. The hallway had windows looking out to the inside of the hotel so you could see all the floors going down in pods - very striking view. Beautiful fountain near the elevators, and glass walls on some of the elevators which was cool. There were lots of shops in the basement area, kind of a small mall area. We didn't really use them as they were quite high end but fun to walk through. We did make use of the hotel grocery store and bakery which had some delicious things. There was also a nail salon that my friend considered using. Ultimately went with a cheaper one in Shibuya but it was convenient if you wanted to get your nails done at the hotel. They also offer in room massages until 2am - not cheap but not bad and very convenient.All the hotel restaurants were gorgeous with great ambience and delicious food. The Japanese restaurant was incredibly ambient with serene little booths with traditional tables and mats and a little footpath over a stream leading to the booths as you walk through the restaurant. Had some lovely tempura there. Staff were great. My favorite meal of our entire Tokyo trip was at the Yakitori place, where we had mouthwatering grilled vegetables and Camembert. I got leeks, peppers, and asparagus a la carte as I'm vegetarian but there are set meals with multiple courses if you can eat anything. The ice cream for dessert was delicious too. Staff were extremely friendly and polite and seated us even when we arrived a few minutes before last orders one night. It was so good we went twice during our stay. Fun seating arrangement too, they cook the food in the middle right in front of you. All in all, would definitely return if I was looking to stay in this area of Tokyo again. It's quite near Roppongi Hills, not too far from Tsukiji. About half hour on the train from Shibuya and Shinjuku, a cab coming back from those areas late at night ended up costing about 2000 yen or less. Balcony and spacious room size were a highlight for me, as was the excellent choice of delicious food conveniently downstairs.Thank you for a nice stay!","Cardiff, United Kingdom","924jd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cardiff, United Kingdom</strong>",7,5.0

The room had a fab view over the Tokyo tower, was sufficiently big and the bathroom had both a shower and a bathtub. Breakfast was great value for the good selection it offered. The gym was about 20$ but it had a decent selection of cardio and weight machines. The same for the pool - also 20$. Definitely staying again next time. We arrived at 8am, check in was 2pm, they let us get into our room for an extra 100$ which was fair.","London, United Kingdom","Granduelle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",182,5.0

The rooms are spacious and include all the usual deluxe accoutrements: valet stand, kimonos, deluxe toiletries, ultra-deluxe hands-off toilet, shower, separate tub, etc. All clean as a whistle. I found day cleaning and dry cleaning to be cheaper than most hotels and perfectly efficient. They attempt to help the environment by offering a $10/day rebate if you don't need new sheets every day. This rebate can be used in their restaurants (4 I believe) or even their sundry shop for incidentals...really a smart and helpful idea. The hotel is convenient to 2 subway lines, sits in the shadow of the Tokyo tower amid a park setting, most unusual for a Tokyo hotel.

It is situated in a nice uptown neighbourhood and next to a large park while just a couple blocks away and prominently in view is the Tokyo Tower. The hotel is also an easy 10 mins walk from the underground.The rooms were reasonably large and had plenty of room to put the suitcases down and still be able to move around without bumping into furniture. While the room was clean and tidy the decor was uninspiring and plain. The beds were a bit on the hard side which seems to be a standard feature anyway in most hotels in the land of the rising sun. One problem we did have was with the A/C. On some days the room temperature was stuck at 23 and as hard as we tried we could not get it cooler. On other days the room temperature did go below 23 but never as low as we had set the thermostat. It did cause us to have some sleepless nights.One awkward feature of the triple room we stayed in was the toilet being separate from the bathroom meaning that you either had to always keep 2 sets of handwash kits or you had to constantly switch rooms in order to stay hygienic. The toilet was also similar in size to what you would find on a Boeing 777 meaning you had to fold your newspaper several times to read a small column without it always wrapping up the side of the walls. The best way to get to the hotel from Tokyo station is by taxi which will cost almost JPY 2,000. If you only have small hand luggage then it can be easily reached from either the Shibakoen or the Akabanabashi station. Both stations have signs pointing you to the correct exit.","Bangkok, Thailand","BritinBangkok</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",97,4.0

When I came back they quickly got me checked in and escorted me up to my room. During my stay I had nothing but great interactions with all of the staff I came across.

The bathroom and room size were very large for Japan and the jacuzzi tub felt amazing after long days of walking and exploring Tokyo.Price: This was an incredible value for the view and service at the Hotel. I am not saying it was cheap but for Tokyo for this large of a room and that view it was a sensational value.Location: It is a 7-10 minute walk to Tokyo Tower and 5 minutes to Zojo-ji Temple.

From these 2 stations it is very easy to get around Tokyo. The taxi ride from Tokyo Station to the hotel was not too long or expensive either.The only downside was there are not a lot of nearby places to dine apart from the Hotel (there are some places inside Tokyo tower to grab a bite). This was not a problem for me as the Hotel had a convenience store for breakfast and I ate out while exploring the city.

No matter what your taste is: the room is very spacious. Internet, both by cable or wifi, is free. During my one week stay the speed of the connection varied from reasonably quick to dead slow.The thing I appreciated most was the balcony. Most tall buildings don't have balconies and if they do the door / window is locked. The Prince Park Tower offers accessible balconies at high floors with an amazing view of the city. I couldn't stop myself from taking pictures out there almost every day!Another nice detail: there's a button near the frig (mini bar) to turn it off, so it doesn't make any noise during the night. Since the hotel is in a quiet neighbourhood anyway, expect long quiet nights.The hotel is remarkably conscious about the environment. One can refuse cleanup of the room every other day. This isn't just good for the environment but also for your wallet, because the hotel will give a 1,000 yen coupon. The hotel slippers are dry cleaned and thus reusable. When the air con is off when leaving the room, it remains off when re-entering the room later (most hotels turn it on by default). Very good!The Prince Park Tower is connected to the ""airport limousine"" (bus) service to the airport.

My sister had paid for the hotel. The staff knew sufficient English to converse with foreigners but (as the usual case in Japan), it was easier to understand them in Japanese. I was the only who can do this though, and it really does help that they can converse in English since I can't always be interpreting.I'm giving the hotel 4 stars because of two things: one, housekeeping forgot to replace our slippers for one night and we had to request for them; and the housekeeping staff can't really understand English that well (I had to make the request in this case). My second gripe is the fact that you have to pay $20 per person for usage of the gym and spa, which was usually free in a number of hotels we have stayed in. Well, at least there was a park right around the hotel, and in the absence of a gym, you can always just run around the perimeter and back.On the room: I loved the built-in jacuzzi and just to maximize what was paid for, I made use of it every night. ;) Very good after a long day of walking around Tokyo. The toilet was the most high-tech I've ever seen. It had a person detector (or whatever you call it) which was sort of cool, but sometimes creepy when the toilet cover and light suddenly closes. :P The beds were very comfortable and we always had a good night's sleep.WiFi is also provided in the rooms, and is pretty fast. I hate that you always have to input the username and password every single time.Our room had a terrace and it was overlooking Tokyo Tower, so we had excellent views of it in the morning and at night.The hotel also provides free shuttle buses to JR-Hamamatsucho Station.

The hotel offers, however, a bus shuttle to Tamachi station giving access to the JR Yanamote ring line. Finding a good restaurant within walking distans can also be tricky. I chose to go to Roppongi or Yurakucho for dinner. The hotel has, however, some good restaurants, and if breakfast isn't included there is a shop with bread and such. Also on the pro side is the hot spring bath, which was really nice, worth the 2000 yen charge for a visit.So no suprises, and above all no complaints.

After the check-in at the reception, you must cross a bridge over water, within the building, to access the elevators. The area play with colours and materials, mainly metal and mirrors, blueish greenish as well as the water.The hotel is really a tower with three faces and 33 levels, having a lounge in its top floor. From that floor you can see the Tokyo tower so close that you have the impression that you can touch it. At night, the view of the Tower and the city is unforgettable. The hotel is also close to a metro station.Many facilities: 8 restaurants, among others, specialised in teppanyaki, or sushi, or tempura, or yakitori or modern Japanese fusion; a bakery, nice shops, and a health club. Pity I though is that to use the pool you must pay the equivalent to around US $ 20 (you can use the gym, sauna and hot spring), but if you want to use a pool every day during a week, that is quite an additional cost. Only people over 20 can use it. So one of my teenagers could not use it.The rooms are really good, including flat LCD TV, Jacuzzi bath tub and and touch with electronic curtains. Breakfast is of high quality and served in one of the top floor, so view is beautiful. Staff is friendly and effective.Definitely a place to come back. My hint is to keep a card with the hotel's name and address to show to taxi drivers. There is another hotel very close to this one, called ""Tokyo Prince Hotel"" and at the beginning of our stay, 2 times the taxi drivers mistaken the 2 hotels.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","JuPereira</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",397,5.0

The hotel is right next to Tokyo Tower and has amazing views of the city from the breakfast room and bar. Unfortunately the view from my room was not great as I was on the wrong side for the city/tower. I had a corner room which was spaciouss but dated. The bathroom was very large and had a great shower. The hotel has WiFi but it was a bit of a hassle trying to connect as you had to follow some confusing instruction through the TV to get a code. I really don't know why they can't just give you a code at check in. Once connected the Wifi worked very well. We took the main buffet breakfast on the top floor and the buffet selection is ok, nothing exciting, however the views are amazing! The panoramic bar is also well worth a visit to enjoy Tokyo by night. All in all I would not regard this hotel as 'luxury'.

The staff is incredible and most speak English, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, the views incredible. The restaurants are good, if a bit pricey, but that's to be expected in a hotel like this - a cocktail is $14.00 in the lobby lounge, but then again, there is no tipping in Japan, so it's probably the equivalent of a U.S. bar bill. The one star gets deducted because I am a westerner who likes my daily coffee. And there was no cafe on the premises and the closest one was a ten minute walk away. The hotel is located in a scenic park with walkways and a temple and somewhat hidden (both are worth visiting) cemetery if you have not seen a Japanese one. If coffee is not an issue for you and you don't need to be able to walk to shops (everything is a subway ride away), then by all means stay here. I just wouldn't recommend it to American first timers. Pros: besides the above, the full American/Japanese breakfast buffet was worth the $28. Buy it as part of your package ahead of time, it may be cheaper. The restaurant is on the 33 floor and has lovely views of city.Bowling alley in the concourse level, is super fun, they serve snacks and drinks/alcohol.Cons: besides location, the wi-fi was a bit weird, it's free and fast, but each time you turn on your laptop or phone, you have to log in again. No way to save the password. Minor inconvenience. Room tip: many rooms have narrow balconies, you can step outside but nothing more than that and friends with the balcony noted it was quite noisy when they opened the door. The corner rooms however have a comfortable layout for one or two people. I had a corner room ending with 23, (1523, 1623, etc). It had a view of the Tokyo Tower and I highly recommend it. The bathroom had huge windows with the same view, was very cool.Dining tip: the breakfast buffet is worth the money, but as others have mentioned here (and thank you everyone for the tip) there is a fantastic french bakery that serves full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu a ten minute walk through the park grounds attached to the hotel. It opens at 7:30am and last order is at 8pm. Try it at least once. www.lepainquotidien.jp Hotel gift shop: has its own bakery too and you can grab an good croissant in a rush and /or late night drinks, water and alcohol all very reasonably priced.Didn't get to try the spa or pool, but they offer in-room massages for a reasonable price.Shopping trip: Get the Pasmo subway pass and load up some $ for the week so you don't have to buy individual tickets.

The hotel was built in 2008 and starting show signs of wear and tear. I would not consider it luxury property judging by the design, materials used to furnish the rooms, amenities, etc. Have you ever seen budget leatherette furniture of orange/brown shade and somewhat uncomfortable to sit in? Look no further, this hotel and your room will have plenty of it... There are too many unnecessary controls, nobs and switches on the walls, bathrooms, corridors, etc. - very traditional. The confort of the bedding was OK. We did get upgraded to a larger room with a direct view of the tower - I think we tried too hard as we got a room of monstrous proportions with emberracingly large bed (eventually we discovered that there were two queen beds pulled together). The staff provided with a nice crib and bedding for our 12 month old. As far as the gym facilities, which I managed to use only once, there is a charge of 2,000 Yen to use there pool / hot tubs (this was an issue in my mind as I am not accustomed to pay for hotel gym facilities a la carte). The biggest issue is that the gym is situated underground and is about 10-12 walk from your room! On the way to the gym you will pass wedding planning services and other related businesses... The location is central but there is little to do in the area. Instead of overpriced hotel breakfast on 30+ floor, you can do a nice breakfast at Le Pain Quotidien near by. There are NO kids play rooms and they are not allowed in the lounge (which is understandable).","San Francisco, California","dshoko</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",25,3.0

My previous visit involved a stay at The Prince Park Tower Tokyo Hotel which I already reviewed and gave 5/5 to. Of course with a decent review as previously provided, I was keen to repeat my stay.The second time around I was not as impressed and mainly on the basis of our first room.I booked a couple of months in advance. Rates were quite high and the budget only afforded a twin room. This meant low floor, no balcony but still a very reasonably sized room to Japan. Having notched up 7 trips to Tokyo, and visiting many hotels throughout the country I can state that The Prince Park Tower Tokyo Hotel has extremely decent sized rooms. If you come from Australia or North America, your definition of size may not agree with this statement - but Tokyo is a dense city. Expectations cannot be based on what you expect back home.Note: we were to learn later on that rates available on the day from the hotel were actually cheaper than what we paid online 2 months prior. Check against the hotel website for today's rates and compare. In hindsight, we could have paid for the better room for the amount we spent on the cheaper twin.Having stayed a year and a half prior, seeing the small twin on the 10th floor was slightly disappointing. But you get what you pay for, and the rooms are as stated prior - large for Tokyo.We left, came back, got settled and noted one thing out of place. There was an ashtray and a sign saying - ""don't smoke in the bed"". The cigarette smell then became evident.Japan is certainly cleaner and safer than Australia and the US, but smoking rates are among the highest in the OECD which means that smoking floors that have all but been eliminated in the west, are still very common in Japan.We're non-smokers and couldn't stay in the room.It's at this point Japanese customer service (exemplified by The Prince Park Tower Tokyo) is illustrated. I spoke with the front desk and explained the problem. They admitted they had overlooked my non-smoking request, apologised and without fuss relocated us to a much higher, premium room with balcony and view of Tokyo Tower.Smoking floors aside, the location, staff and cleanliness of the rooms are all very good for the rates you'll pay.Rooms fittings and service are benchmarks which will be hard to find elsewhere for the same price.To assist travellers, those who travel using the extremely convenient Japan Rail Pass will find this hotel ideal. The main Shinkansen stations are Tokyo and Shinagawa; both have connections to the super efficient Yamanote JR line (59 minute, dual direction loop train around central Tokyo - it's free to Rail Pass holders and identified by green stripe on the side of the train).The best JR station on this line for the hotel is Hamamatsucho. It's the midpoint between Tokyo and Shinagawa (6 minutes in either direction, with a train every couple of minutes).Once at the Hamamatsucho station, head to the west side of the station and look for bus terminal 5. The hotel shuttle is at quarter past and quarter to the hour with Japanese precision; on the second.","Sydney, Australia","bondiau</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",76,5.0

The bathroom, which I tend to be particular about in hotels, was very nice and clean with a separate tub and shower and enough amenities to start a CVSWifi- the (free)wifi worked well throughout the hotel and in the roomsStore- there is a store at the hotel that stays open til 1am for those late night cravings or pick up a few necessitiesBowling Alley- there is a nice bowling alley at the hotel and the prices were surprisingly cheap, there is a bar in there tooBreakfast Buffet- there is an omelet station and a variety of meats, fruits, breads, etc to choose from.

The Akabanebashi station is across the street but it is only serviced by the Oedo lineRoom- Even though I had a non-smoking room, it sometimes had a faint smoky odor Gym/Pool/Sauna- did not get to use the facilities because the price to use them was high, I believe 2000 yen for one or 4000 yen for all","Sandy Springs, Georgia","HurricaneRu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sandy Springs, Georgia</strong>",27,4.0

The concierge was helpful in providing maps and general information, but the language barrier hindered some answers to specific questions I had. The hotel is extremely close to Akabanabashi Station (about a 3 minute walk), which was the starting point for nearly all my travels. A free hotel shuttle can take you to another station (on the JR line), if needed. As a female traveling solo, safety was very important to me.

It was convenient to take the limousine (hotel shuttle bus that you pay for at Narita airport) to the hotel. The lobby is very open, smelled of fresh flowers (maybe orchids), with a nice water feature. The staff are dressed up. Men's uniform look like tuxedos. Bell-women wore hats too. In general, staff members speak Japanese only. They cater to mostly Japanese clients. They do have a few staff members who can speak English (one: really well, the rest: OK for basic communication). We had a few communication issues when we asked for adapter plugs for our computer and when we tried to ship our luggage to Kyoto. The building (inside and out) looks a bit sterile, lacking design. We were in a standard room with two single beds. The rooms are spacious with a large bathroom (combined room with toilet, shower, separate tub), but the furnishings look a bit cheap. It reminded me of particle board with brown veneer. It had all the Japanese necessities, including hot water boiler (which they fill with fresh water every day), slippers, shoe brush, shoe horn.We went to the 33rd floor for the western breakfast buffet everyday. Service was great. There were eggs, bacon, sausages, lots of fruits, drinks. The eggs were not the best texture. Some dishes were not well-labeled. There was a ""daily meat"" item, which looked like ground pork/veal/beef mini patties with mushroom sauce, which was there everyday. Not sure what it was but it was tasty. They also had chawanmushi (Japanese egg custom made with chicken broth) and soba noodles (with soy dipping sauce). These were good as well. There is a beautiful view of Tokyo Tower and the surrounding areas.We had the JR pass, so the closes station was Hamamatsucho on JR Yamanote line. This is roughly 20 minutes to walk, but there is an hourly shuttle bus which goes from the hotel (also serving two other Prince hotels) to the station and back. We took the shuttle bus a few times, but it was difficult to time your trips around the shuttle bus schedule (even though they were always on time). The surrounding neighbourhood is very quiet compared to other parts of Tokyo (e.g. our other hotel near Shinagawa had many more restaurants and shops nearby). The park is peaceful, but at 5:30 am, the shrine nearby starts their prayers with a few gongs. This woke me up every morning. Without many restaurants within easy walking distance (for elderly and younger family members), we ate two dinners at the hotel (basement). We had sushi one day and yakitori another day. The food was great but the prices were very high.

For breakfast we went across to the Pain Quotidien near the temple - 5 mins round the block from the hotel.Overall an excellent choice for an expensive and cramped city like Tokyo.","Singapore, Singapore","barve</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",156,4.0

I got a pretty good rate and for what I paid I thought the hotel was great value.First impressions are not great. The building's architecture is kinda weird, with the structure looking like an out-of-sorts hexagon. The lobby looks a bit dated as well.However, rooms were big. Because of the weird building shape, the rooms are odd-shaped as well but still manage to be spacious. The bathroom is large and feels quite luxurious with black marble floors. However the feel and furnishing is still quite oldish, so those of us who prefer modern luxurious accommodation may not fancy this hotel.Location is not very good. The nearest subway stop is a good 5+ minute walk away. Although the station is 2 stops away from Roppongi, it is a one-line station, making it less convenient to travel to different parts of Tokyo. There is also nothing much to do eat around the hotel, although there is a convenience store in the hotel lobby that is open late.Tokyo Tower is just next door and is well worth a visit. Otherwise you can get a view of the Tower itself from the top-floor hotel lounge.Another nice touch for those of us who are environmentally conscious. The hotel offers a rebate (in the form of vouchers) if you decide not to have housekeeping service. I believe the amount is about JPY1500/night. Too many hotels ask customers to reuse towels in the name of the environment, when they just want to save the cost of laundry. Prince Park though puts its money where its mouth is!Service is great of course, as you'd expect from any Japanese hotel.An airport limousine bus from Haneda brings you straight to the hotel for JPY900 within 30 minutes (of JPY3000 from Narita, 90 minutes).",Singapore,"whatty</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",39,4.0

They were exceeded upon walking into the room.For those who are reading this, but haven't been to Japan yet, go with one expectation in mind. Japanese cities are highly populated and space is at a premium, and the Japanese certainly optimise their use of space. The laws dictating minimum doorway height, minimum roof heights and any other spacing requirements by law certainly don't compare with the sizes we have in Australia. On numerous occasions, I've had to duck just to get through someone's front door. I've hit my head on the ceiling of a Japanese bathroom here and there.I can easily draw comparisons with Italy. I've had barely 2m sq bathrooms in both countries.The Prince Park in this respect is NOT standard. The room I stayed in had a bathroom the size of some Japanese hotels I've stayed in, and even had a separate room for the toilet. Furthermore, while I am no longer surprised by the array of technology and buttons found in Japanese toilets, the Prince Park facilities even out did most of the others. It did everything but talk.Basically my point here is that the hotel rooms are way over the top - even for Japan.The view is spectacular. If you're on the tower side (like we were), you get probably the best view you can get of the tower. It fills the entire window, and you're elevated enough without obstructions to take excellent photos.The only catch for the Prince Park is it's locations.I always like to be on the Yamanote line for convenience. The closest station on the Yamanote line is Hamamatsuchō. But the distance from the station to the hotel is a 10 minute walk crossing many roads. If you have a lot of bags, this can be annoying.The hotel does offer a shuttle to the station. The shuttle leaves each hour at quarter past from Hamamatsuchō Bus Terminal Gate 5. In typical Japanese fashion, expect it on time. Try to at least time your train to arrive on the hour.If you arrive by Shinkansen or Narita Express, the closest station will be Shinagawa (2 stops on Yamanote line to Hamamatsuchō).Stayed January 2012","Sydney, Australia","bondiau</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",76,5.0

I booked a double, but was upgraded to a Junior Suite that had a private elevator and was bigger than most apartments in Tokyo. All the typical amentities of a 4+ star hotel were present. The room was a little outdated compared to the mega modern hotels at the same price level, but definitely not run down. The rooftop bar had great views of the city and Tower next door. The lobby has a very convenient store that's not too overpriced so you don't have to wander around for a Lawsons at night if you want a bottle of wine in your room. The hotel sits back a little from most of the major neighborhoods for tourists, but there are 2 subways within a 5 min walk to get you anywhere you need in no time.

Overall, I would stay here in again in a heartbeat.

To be honest i didnt find the drinks too expensive and with the great view and fantastic staff (Especially Kaz who we got to know quite well and who's english was pretty good) why wouldnt you want to come up here after a long day of travelling to unwind! But hey everyone has a budget so i understand why this may have seemed pricey for some. Another bonus about the hotel which I havnt seen other people mention yet is the bowling saloon which is on B2 Level- what is this you may be thinking?... well you can play ten-pin bowling,billiards or darts. Not cheap i think for an hour of billiards it was 1500 yen per person or something along those lines but it offers something i have never come accross in another hotel before. Some of the cons besides the smell in our room:1. No free wifi in our room, when we asked about it they said housekeeping could deliver a modem to the room, but what they failed to mention was the cost so when we saw a 10,000yen bill in our room for the use of it we returned it to them. 2. Unable to get a takeaway hot coffee anywhere in the hotel, seems such a simple thing but we just couldnt get one so the hotel shop was handy in that respect and we brought cold starbucks cafe lattes for about 200 yen each morning on our way out. Overall we were very happy with the size of the room and the bathroom was we thought abit of luxury, the staff were generally very good and helpful some spoke no english though which made small talk quite difficult. We would stay here again :)","Auckland, New Zealand","kiwisbornandbred</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",3,4.0

But one place that wasn't expensive was our five star hotel, the Prince Park Tower. I was able to book it online during a flash Expedia sale and got it for just over $200 US a night. For this type of hotel, the price was ridiculously cheap. When we walked through the front door, I had to say WOW. The hotel is actually the flagship hotel of the Prince chain and it was designed by Japan's first superstar architect, a man by the name of Tange. We got upgraded to a two room suite the size of an apartment back home. Everything was so clean and tidy. The room has every amenities imagined and not imagined. A heated toilet which bathes your bum after use, anyone? We did not use any of the hotel restaurants but bought freshly made pastries from the gift shop each AM; there was free coffee and tea in the room. We were also offered free use of the nice hotel gym, but had no time to fit it in. I love the free super fast wifi service. I couldn't sleep one night and at 5 AM the room wifi malfunctioned and someone from the front desk came up and fixed it in no time flat. The hotel is five minutes walk to the tube and from there it is a two stop ride to trendy Roppongi where you will find all the best restaurants Tokyo has to offer. Try to visit the new swanky Tokyo MidTown or Roppongi Hills complex to see how the well to do Tokyolites live. Unfortunately the hotel is not in a part of Tokyo where you can walk around to see things. But the Tokyo Tower is next door ( quite dated and not recommended, go see the amazing new 634 m Sky Tree instead) and also a historic Buddhist Temple is a five minutes walk from the hotel and well worth a quick visit. Your shuttle bus from Narita will stop at the front door and the hotel can give you a free ride to the train station if you plan to travel by train after checkout. All in all this is an exceptional property. The service was flawless and all the staff was amazing and will look after you like family. For the price I paid I made out like bandits! Highly recommended. Why pay twice as much for something similar when there is no need.","Toronto, Canada","drandysl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",118,5.0

One can request that one's room is not serviced (except for rubbish bins) and receive vouchers (2 x 500 yen) to spend in the hotel instead. This service can only be requested two days in a row. Thus if one stays for 7 days, with no service on days 2,3,5 &6, one can receive vouchers to the value of 4000 yen.

We are from NYC and speak very little Japanese and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We had family in Japan that called the hotel numerous times and once again the staff was very patience and friendly while translating for us. The location is great! Tokyo is so big that I believe it’s hard to be centrally located however this was by subways, buses, etc. So getting around was easy. (Just as the front desk and they can help you with the subway routes.) Rooms were very comfortable. Restaurants at hotel were over priced but I guess that’s what you get for convenience. (Food was very good) The upstairs lounge that over looks the Tokyo Tower was nice however there is a fee to sit at a table. I would suggest checking out the Fish Market. We had a great lunch there that tasted just like our dinner at the hotel the night before at one third of the price. You do have to pay for gym which was about 20 bucks per person for a 24 hour period. So we were able to get to the gym two days in a row for the cost of one day. Just as a FYI, you are not allowed to use the pool/spa facilities with you have any visible tattoos. Husband and I both have some so we were not able to use those facilities which was a bummer, but we respect the culture so we couldn't complain. Overall it was a great hotel for our first visit to Japan. Not sure if we would stay there again next time because we would want to check out one of the other areas (since Tokyo is so big) but will definitely be looking for that chain to stay in.

While not in the heart of the action, I chose the hotel due to it's serene location at the edge of the park. We had a park view room, and the views of Tokyo Tower were spectacular. The metro was only about a block away, and fairly easy to navigate. The room was light and airy, and the bathroom was clean and modern. The lobby had very little seating, so relaxing and people watching were not really an option.  My major complaint was the restaurant open for breakfast. It opened each morning at 8 am, not early enough if you had an early tour. We arrived one morning at exactly 8 am, and there were at least 50 people on line. I learned my lesson, and every morning after that, I arrived at 7:45 am so we were the first ones on line as they opened. Located on the highest floor, the restaurant had a beautiful view. My other complaint was the price. While I knew that food in Japan would be very expensive, I was shocked that the not-too-impressive buffet was the equivalent of $40 US - and it was the only option. On the lobby level was another restaurant, but only had a Japanese-style menu, and I just can't eat salad and tofu in the morning. The great little convenience store in the lobby also had a bakery, but when we were there it opened at 10 am - also too late for touring. I would recommend the hotel as a true oasis in a bustling city. I found a deal on Expedia that gave us a 50% discount on our whole stay since we were arriving on a Monday, bringing our rate for a deluxe park view room to $166/night US.","Morris Plains, NJ","TerriRH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Morris Plains, NJ</strong>",54,4.0

I was on the 14th floor, and was quite surprised to discover a sizable king-size bed, a decent sized desk to work off of and a well equipped and large bathroom. The rooms are very modern and extremely comfortable.In terms of facilities, I did manage to fit in a gym visit which was great as it also serves as an external gym facility so it is well stocked with free-weights, machines, plenty of treadmills and a yoga/spinning studio (didn't do that but saw it was there). That was great.For location, I selected this hotel due to its proximity to our office. There are at least 2 subway stations easily within walking distance, but apart from Tokyo Tower and the associated shops around that, there isn't a huge amount of choice in the immediate vicinity. You pretty much have to taxi to any one of the many more bustling spots if you want to dine/drink/see outside of the hotel.The only other minor fault for me is that the Japanese restaurant closes somewhat early (9:30). They also don't do Japanese room service after that time - and so as a consequence, after my late international arrival, my only options were western (I was so looking forward to some great Japanese...).All in all, a great hotel, well staffed with helpful people, and overall a very good experience in Tokyo.","Singapore, Singapore","Mathew W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",29,4.0

Everything about this hotel is excellent, from the service to the location, grounds and room. It was a very welcome introduction to Tokyo and Japan. We were upgraded to a premium floor room on the 29th floor which was of generous size for Tokyo (or any city for that matter!). It included one of the largest beds I've ever seen in a hotel room (larger than a normal king size), desk, sitting area and substantial bathroom with separate shower and heavenly large tub with jacuzzi jets. Needless to say, the view from the 29th floor was impressive, overlooking the park (Shiba koen) and out to the Rainbow bridge. As with many Japanese hotels, there were a large variety of bathroom amenities, including a special travel pack to take away. One thing to note is that the design aesthetic in the room is very business-like. It is exceptionally clean and upmarket, but I wouldn't describe it as luxurious. This is not your usual 30-story business tower hotel. Despite it's large size, The Prince Park Tower felt remarkably tranquil. The tower is graced with an ultra-modern atrium that runs up the entire length of the hotel and you are whisked up to your room in sleek glass elevators. The hotel lobby has a very clean aesthetic with glass bridges, silent automatic glass doors, and gentle wood and stone accents. It is an excellent reflection of the modern Japanese aesthetic. The grounds too add to the sense of calm. The Prince Park Tower is unique in being located right in the centre of a large park which includes an old Shinto shrine. The grounds beautifully feature flowers, greenery and that blend of modern and traditional that Japan is famous for. The location is also perfect for it is just off the tourist track and away from the crowds, but close to key subway lines making it convenient to reach districts such as Roppongi, Shibuya and Ginza. The service was superb and what one would expect from a high end, Japanese hotel. Everything was always conscientious, efficient and friendly. The restaurant recommendations were excellent and I would especially recommend the ramen restaurant they prefer. It was the best ramen I've ever had!All in all, this is a top quality, modern Japanese hotel, well worth considering for any trip to Tokyo be it for business or pleasure.",South Pole,"Tanagan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Pole</strong>",109,4.0

So, for our recent trip in July, we booked another deluxe twin room through Kuoni. We arrived at the hotel at around 11:00 AM after a long flight from London. The lady at the front desk told us that we could not check in until 2 PM, which is the official check in time. She told us to go away and come back later and did not even offer us to use the toilet facilities or point out to us where to find the lounge for coffee and refreshments. When we told her that we had requested a room with park view, she looked rather surprised and spent the next 20 minutes or so trying to identify a suitable room for us. Eventually, she told us to leave our luggage with the concierge and come back at 1:00 PM. We thought this was rather unusual as most good hotels do offer to deliver the client's luggage straight to their room when it is ready. Eventually, we came back at the time agreed and a hotel staff helped us with our luggage to our room. Upon checking into our room, we noticed that it was rather smaller than the one we stayed in back in April and did not have a balcony as advertised. However, we were too tired so just tried to relax. The following morning, we looked at our bookings and the information on the hotel's website, which clearly indicated that we were given a standard room instead of a deluxe room, we then decided to go down to reception to ask them to put things right. After checking their records, the hotel staff apologized, handed out 2 free breakfast vouchers to us, and 'upgraded' us to the correct category of room. They then sent a staff up to our room to help us pack and move rooms. Had we not stayed in the hotel before and had not noticed the differences in the room categories, we would not have got what we had booked and paid for. This is rather unacceptable and we would ask the hotel management to address this issue promptly to prevent similar situations in the future. On the other hand, we would strongly recommend other travellers to always make the effort to check that they are allocated the correct room category, for example by checking the hotel website for room descriptions and features. Given what happened, we cannot recommend this hotel unless appropriate improvements are made to ensure good, satisfactory customer services.","London, United Kingdom","toine9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",55,3.0

Ok where i was going with that was that when we checked in , it was rather hard the girl unfortunately had limited english had found it quite hard to arrange an upgrade to find out what the price would be , non the less with allot of hand signals and miming we got there. We got up to our room which was lovely , not on a super high floor but had a great view of tokyo tower , which is magical at night. The room was on the corner and bit of an odd shape but very nice and just enough room for us to have all our bags out .

The small shop in the foyer provides everything you need with a little bakery too , prices are prob 20% more than what you will pay on the street but its open late and takes credit card unlikely nearly everywhere else in Japan , cash is def king in Japan .

Make sure you buy the japan rail pass before you get there if you are going to do any travel at all it will be well worth it!

Everything is super clean and in excellent condition.Beautiful bathrooms. Wired internet worked wonderfully. Room was well appointed with Nespresso coffee maker, tea (maker), fridge and free bottled water. Staff was EXCELLENT, English speaking. Conceirge really helped me with figuring out train schedules/routes. Location is fine, easy access to subway and a shuttle to Hamamatsu-cho. Fresh bakery items through the lobby store make for yummy, cheap breakfast. Easy grab and go to begin your day.","Los Angeles, California","CalifAdventurer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",31,5.0

On the plus side the location is excellent. Many rooms have great views of the Tokyo skyline and the Tokyo Tower; the hotel is clean and very well maintained; the gym is large and well-equipped; staff are friendly and attentive; and the price is reasonable for Tokyo standards.There are various minor annoyances, though: room décor is bland and old-fashioned (I stayed on the Premium Floor); rooms are small; for regular rooms there are extra charges for the use of the gym and ironing board; there is no wireless internet; the gym is not open 24h (annoying for jet-lag victims); and the breakfasts were very disappointing.",Rio de Janeiro,"EmilRio</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong>",74,3.0

We used to stay at the Shinagawa Prince, despite its shortcomings, because the location simply can't be beat, but when the Prince Park Tower opened, we switched and have never looked back. The hotel is much newer (2005) and more modern than the Shinagawa Prince, and the service is excellent. If we stopped by the concierge desk on our way out with anything in our hands, such as a shopping bag, someone immediately came over to see if we needed help. Housekeeping was similarly polite, stopping their vacuuming in the hallway and bowing as we passed by.It had been a few years since our last trip, and it seems that the rooms have already been renovated. There is now a sofa in one corner of the room, and we discovered that it is also a sleeper - handy if you need another bed. The toilet is now in its own tiny, separate room, which is really convenient if someone is tying up the bathroom bathing, shaving, etc and nature calls.The view of Tokyo Tower is spectacular if you're lucky enough to be on that side of the hotel. You can also see parts of Shiba Park as well as Zojoji next door.There are a few negatives, but so far they haven't been enough to make me choose another hotel. The in house restaurants are very expensive, and the food I've tried so far hasn't been as good as the prices would lead you to hope. $200 for a tenpura dinner for two, $123 for a steak of 100 grams (less than a quarter pound), etc. The location, while picturesque, is not as convenient as some, although they do have a hotel shuttle running from early morning to late at night. It goes by Hamamatsucho Station and the nearby Tokyo Prince. The Akabanebashi station on the Oedo subway line and the Shiba Koen station on the Mita subway line are a 5-10 minute walk, or you can have the doorman call one of the cabs that are always lined up in front.One last item - the beds are terrible! I don't know if it's because they're too firm, or too packed down or what, but I just did not get along with those beds at all. Your mileage may vary.Summary: nice building and recently renovated rooms, great service, great views if you're on the Tokyo Tower side, expensive restaurants, good but not great location, lousy beds.",way out west,"gsn794</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>way out west</strong>",44,4.0

Also, the man that checked us in did not smile, barely said a word, and processed our reservation quickly. I've never felt so unwelcome at a hotel (especially in Japan!). I had reserved a non-smoking room - but our whole floor and room still smelled like smoke, so I would stay clear of this hotel if smoke smells bother you at all.

We booked this for our return leg after touring other Japanese cities. We decided to splurge a bit so as to give ourselves a treat. I must say that it is one of the best accommodation decisions of our trip.Pros====- Very big room. Bed is supposed to be king size but a more accurate description is super king-sized.- Room has a superb view. Catching the sunrise/sunset with full view of Zojoji temple and Tokyo tower is an experience that we will not forget.- Nice bathroom, classy fixtures, excellent toiletries. - The surrounding Shiba park is nothing to scream about but give the nearby area a greener, less built-up feel, which is a luxury in itself in Tokyo.- Fantastic service staff. The best english speakers we met for the whole duration of 12 days in Japan were all staff of Prince Park Towers!- Very close to Akabanebashi of the Oedo line. Shiba-Koen station, which is the recommended subway stop by the hotel, is further away. - Limousine bus service direct to Narita Airport.- There is a daily 1000 yen rebate for going green (i.e no toiletries/towel change, making up of room etc.) We could use the vouchers in the hotel shop or restaurants. - Shuttle Bus service to Hamamatsuchō JR Station. Good eateries near the station. We went into this Izakaya restaurant, Akitaya, on a rainy night and had a most amazing dinner. Another Japanese fast food restaurant, Gindaco, is just a few shop-spaces away.Cons====- Nothing that I can think of. This might be a con to some lighter sleepers in that a gong in the Zojoji temple will go off upon sunrise, which was 5.15 am in April. However, we appreciate the different atmosphere that it lent to the hotel stay and showed us another side of Tokyo.Summary=======Not the cheapest but good value for the package and the experience.Tip===Visit the hotel website. They have a very informative page about shuttle bus timetable and map of the bus terminal. We had no problem at all following them.","Singapore, Singapore","Hwee Chong C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",127,5.0

And the view is quite spectacular, especially if you are in the mid-to-high floors, even if it was not a Tokyo Tower-facing room.Gym and onsen is okay. A long trek underground from the main hotel building, and it's not free. Actually if you go to the gym alone it is free for hotel guests, but access to the onsen and pool will require additional payment, which I thought was quite worth it.Perhaps the biggest complaint is the neighbourhood. There is NOTHING around! Took me almost 10 minutes to walk to the nearest convenient store, which was even less well stocked than the hotel shop. And there is no restaurant nearby.

I booked the hotel for one week and supposedly had a king bed in a ""superior"" room.Upon arrival I was given a ""park"" room on the 18th floor. The second the elevator opened we were overwhelmed with the unmistakable smell of embedded cigarette smoke. The room was even worse. Two beds instead of one and it looked and smelled like some cheap motel from Vegas in the late 70's.I immediately went down to the lobby to ask for a non-smoking room and king bed, queen, whatever. No dice. I was told that WAS a non-smoking room and that my reservation was ""park"" even though the printout I had said ""superior."" They brought up some gizmo to help clear the air but of course that's worthless. So while they were setting that up I hopped on the laptop and booked a room at three times the price at the Ritz in Roppongi, on a club level floor. Wow. Wow for the insanely decadent room on the 53rd floor with a forever view of Tokyo and all the amenities that come with that and wow for the credit card charge. Eek! But, you get what you pay for as someone else here recently commented.My wife and I spent 8 days in Seoul and 8 days in Tokyo, and besides all of the memories of activities on the itinerary, etc., the one thing that stood out most was the incredible hospitality of even matter of fact transactions at a cash register, etc. However, The Prince Park Tower was the exception to this, and the only one. The staff was flat out deceitful.When I simply grabbed my own luggage and came down and told them I needed a taxi to the Ritz, they immediately started searching for another room and wanted me to stay. What upset me so much is that I had even offered to pay more for a better room when I first came down to request a non-smoking room and they claimed previously that there were simply no rooms left. When they told me that all of a sudden they could accommodate me, that was sayonara. I don't even know at this point if I'm going to get my money back or not for the pre-paid seven nights.All that said, considering the ridiculously amazing stay we had at the Ritz, I'm actually glad it happened this way now.

The location is actually quite good within Tokyo but you have to know that you'll have to take the Metro from either of the 2 stations close-by, which are located on 2 different lines and are within less than 5 minutes on foot. There 3 room categories in the hotel, with ""Park room"" being the most basic and ""Superior"" the mid-range. Only seen those two but the hotel website has pics of the other categories. The difference between 'Park' & 'Superior' is basically in the view, floor elevation, room layout (all Park rooms have twin beds) and minor differences in room size and fitout. Rooms are spacious and come with an accordingly sized bathroom, which includes a jacuzzi tub! The electronic safe is the largest I've ever seen in a hotel room and it can easily hold a large laptop case! During our 2-nights stay, the A/C wasn't coping well with the warm temperature outside (29°) and and couldn't bring the room temperature below 24°C at any time during the day, even at full power. However, the furniture style and colours in the rooms are reminiscent of the late 60s early 70s era and look extremely old-fashioned and don't do the hotel's positioning among the 'Leading Hotels of The World' any justice. The rooms are actually very functional with all the comfort that a business traveller or a couple on holiday could ask for, yet they lack any sense of appeal. So if you're only looking for a comfortable place to sleep at the end of a long day outside and you get a good room rate below USD 200, then this might be a good option. If you enjoy hotel luxury and are looking for a memorable stay while in Tokyo, then look elsewhere.We had booked online and requested a room with a double bed and a nice view, which was confirmed by the hotel. We arrived to the hotel around 9 pm to check in and were given a 'Park' room with twin beds and no view. When I protested and pointed out to the confirmation of my requests, I was told that they had no more rooms left with double beds and all they had to offer was a room with 2 adjacent beds on one of the 'Superior' floors. We eventually had to take that room and although the staff were very courteous, friendly and helpful at all times, it left us with a bit of disappointment. It seems that rooms are allocated on a first-come first-served basis, so since we checked in quite late, we had o take whatever was available. Special requests would only be honoured as long as corresponding rooms are still vacant. The hotel breakfast costs US 40$ per person but the hotel shop and bakery have a good selection of danish pastry, croissants and breads if you don't want to spend that much on breakfast. To rounds things up, this is a good and practical business hotel which also caters for package-tourists. Comparing it to a luxury hotel like the Ritz-Carlton Tokyo, which we stayed at previously, would be like comparing for example, a fully-loaded Lexus to a fully-loaded Hyundai: They may be similarly equipped for a high level of comfort and drive you safely from A to B, yet the former feels luxurious while the latter feels cheap and far less refined. No one would, at least currently, prefer a Hyundai over a Lexus for the same price and there is hardly anything exclusive about the Prince Park Tokyo Tower to justify the regular (high) room rates you may sometimes find online and which are rather at the level of Tokyo's established exclusive hotels.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Dany_DXB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",61,3.0

We had a ""Park Floor"" type of a room, and I can tell you it wasn't nearly as good as one would expect after reading all the good reviews for this hotel. The room furnishings were so 1950s (vinyl, cheap wood, strange color carpeting, etc), even though I understand this is a fairly new hotel. Sadly, we found stains on more than one bed sheet, too.Unfortunately, I increasingly see this phenomenon that hotels have rooms with vastly different qualities (sometimes rooms in old wings vs. those in new wings), and I suspect the glowing reviews are for the better rooms in such hotels. We did not get to see the other types of rooms in this hotel, but I can say without any hesitation that the room type we had surely does not deserve 4.5 out of 5 rating. Maybe 3.One last word. We moved to this hotel after spending three nights at the Four Seasons Hotel in Tokyo, because Four Seasons was twice the money and its location is a bit far from interesting areas, BUT there is no comparison between the kind of room you get at Four Seasons and what you get at this hotel.

It's a long bus ride from the Narita Airport, and in our case it was the very last stop on the bus route, so it took the better part of 90 minutes to get to the hotel. The staff was very welcoming and the lobby, while somewhat chopped up with pillars and bridges, was convenient and handsome. The rooms were small, as in all Japanese hotels, but clean, efficient, and well organized.Behind the check-in area there is a small shopping area and a very large restaurant for tea and snacks. It overlooks a handsome waterfall and made for a great spot to sit and plan our coming week's work. We ate in the hotel one night, and that was in a cluster of restaurants in the basement, below the lobby. The food was tasty and the service very cordial.The other nights we walked out of the hotel and turned left, going towards the city center. We found numerous restaurants and coffee shops, including a Starbucks, all just a short walk away.Behind the hotel is a public park (go out the front door of the hotel and climb the stairs on the left) which was pleasant and filled with people, puppies and plants.Also behind the hotel is the famous Tokyo Tower, a TV tower modeled after the Eiffel Tower of Paris. It's a bit of a walk but we strolled up there and enjoyed the view.One minor point -- this hotel has the best elevator service of any hotel in which I have ever stayed. You never waited more than seconds for the lift to arrive. It's almost like it sensed you were coming and pre-positioned the elevator on your floor.

The room type that I chose had a Tokyo Tower photo where some room type did not. And I checked their English page on facility, it states that gym use is free for members. I took the hotel shuttle from the JR station, I was sitting right at the station with my heads down and the driver simply drove over without stopping to ask. I had to run to shoot so the driver pulled back. I didn't mind that as he may have just missed me. At the checked in, I got a room on upper floor as advertised then I asked whether my room had the Tower view and she said ""NO"", so I said why not as my reservation showed the Tower photo. She said it's ""just an image"" so I said, that is false advertising because it didn't state in the site that it is just an image. Secondly, I asked about the gym usage, she said I can't use it and again, I said why not, and she said, it's for members only. So I showed her my Prince membership card and she said not this type of membership. She meant an actual gym membership. What the heck and I brought my gym gears? Again, false advertising, unless you work for Prince, you would not know what they really mean on their site. I was tired so I didn't want to argue. It was 4pm and I had a conference call at 5pm and I always use my calling card, so I showed the staff my toll free number and I asked whether I can use it and she looked at the number and said ""I DON""T KNOW"". I was like, go ask figure it out Ms Customer Service. Then she finally called somebody and told me it would cost me 3xx yen per call. So 3 minutes to the call, I dialed the number and it didn't work. So I called the front desk and they didn't really speak English well to understand my problem. Anyways, I got to an operator and told her this number does not work. So she dialed it and it worked but the touch tone couldn't work as I needed to punch in the password and passcode, etc.... As I was already late for the important call, I called their front desk again, and asked them to send someone to come up to help. In the meantime, I used my cell (expensive) and for 10 mins nobody came, so I called again to ask them send somebody up. I didn't want to bomb my mobile bill so I decided to use the hotel room to dial long distance to connect my confererence. They finally had somebody came up and I told her the problem and I asked her to go find out exactly how I can dial the toll free from my room and I reminded her to make sure try in another room first. She came back within 10 mins and told me I just have to ignore the first zero (actually I tried that already but also didn't work), so I said did you try it in another room? She said NO, I said then how do you know? She said my boss told me. I was so pissed off already, so I told her to get someone else. Then finally another lady came at 5:40pm and she said my number DOES NOT work in the room and suggest I use the PUBLIC PHONE, WTF? Listen to this, this is the BEGINNING, so I went down to the front desk after my call and asked me how much is the bill and they said 16,000 yen. I told them what happened because they gave me wrong info and I had an important call so I had to use their phone to call direct and I do not think I should pay for it. She went to get a manager and they didn't like my idea and the manager said, if my toll free didn't work, I should make a ""collect call"" instead, WTF? I had to go out so I parted from the conversation and came back at 11pm, this time the same manager and staff plus another manager (3 staff), I re-explained the whole situation why it was their fault and I should be paid for it and they kept saying the I should use ""collect call"" and in fact their operator did connect to the number but just I couldn't touch tone. I was like, that is the exact idea, your phone didn't function 100% and caused me inconvenience. So I asked, if your operator connected the line fine but if I can't hear from the room phone, should I still pay for it. They replied ""YES"", can you believe it? I spent another 90 mins till like 12:30am midnight with those three stuborn staff who completely lack of sense of customer service or I should say common sense. They said the best they can do is 30% off and I didn't accept, so they said they want to come to my room now and checked my phone, I said what will happen whether my phone works or not, the manager said they can only offer 30% off regardless of the result of checking the phone. I was like...then why you want to come up my room at 12:30AM if you can offering me the same 30% off, there was absolutely no value of coming to my room. I told them that if this happen to a real international branded hotel, the conversation would have ended in 5 mins and I wouldn't have to pay for it because they realize it is their fault. I was so mad and tired so I just went back to my room. I asked them to provide a contact from their head office and they said they can give me a customer service number but they never gave it to me. Next day, they slipped a letter and said they tried the number from another room and it worked and suggested me to come to front desk. I didn't go as I know they simply wouldn't get it. On the day of checkout, they still wanted to charged me the full 16,000 yen and I told them no way and they told me the samething about the other room works, so I told them ""It does not matter whether it works in another room, what matters is your staff gave me wrong and different information about the phone and at the time I wanted to use it, it didn't work"". I told them I was in a hurry so I just paid them the amount less 30% off. Japanese hotel simply do not understand customer service and they don't think from the customer's shoe. This is one reason Japanese hotels can never be popular internationally, only Japanese would stay in Japanese hotel outside Japan. This is by far, my worst stay at a hotel with ""lack of customer service sense"" staff.",hong kong,"cidernet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>hong kong</strong>",53,1.0

By comparison, this was not the best. Firstly - beware! Smoking is not banned in many places e.g. the top floor bar would have been very nice had it not been for the stink of cigarette smoke (and the high prices). The ground floor cafe/tea room was always extremely cold - wear a woolen or freeze. They have no gluten free options at all and they take make the black tea very very weak indeed. Most of the staff speak quite good English so communication is simple. We had a high floor room with a view of Tokyo Towers which looks nice when lit up at night. It claims to be higher than the Eiffel Tower but this can only be because of a huge mast on the top!! Tokyo Towers has little to offer the visitor and for better views I'd suggest the World Trade Centre Building a 40-story commercial skyscraper located in Hamamatsuchō. You can walk there in 15 - 20 minutes and pass the temple and many shops on route. The hotel is clearly focussed on weddings at the weekends and business conferences through the week and was very busy with both of these. If your idea of a leisure break is to get pushed out of the way at the lifts by Japanese business men or bowled over by wedding guests - stay here. The holiday maker and the individual business traveller (were a bit of each) are 2nd class. I can't blame this entirely on the hotel but they appeared to have the same attitude. Everything costs extra and it was overpriced so we did not use many facilities. The room was large and comfortable enough if a bit dull. The bathroom is the best part - high tech and included many more toiletries than the average western hotel. I couldn't see how the many shops and salons etc in the basement survive as I rarely saw anybody other than staff in them. The room was cold and despite asking for help nobody seemed able to turn down the a/c. I had to sit with a blanket round me. The worst part was that there appeared to be no lounge just for hotel guests. I have been surprised by some other feedback comments re a top floor lounge because even when I asked I was told there was none. Perhaps this was an 'extra' that also had to be paid for. Breakfast was very varied and well cooked on the 2 days I tried it but the restaurants were very expensive and we found they were either empty and soleless or totally full with noisy conference delegates. Would we stay here again? No. I disagree with the comments that said there is no nearby transport as we found two lines within easy walking distance but the hotewl is clearly not geared to addressing the needs of those staying for leisure.","Leatherhead, United Kingdom","barbaravR8412NN</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leatherhead, United Kingdom</strong>",193,3.0

I wasn't sure whether it was a good idea to stay in this kind of place, and it turned out it was!The whole experience was great: the reception desk, the elevators, their rooftop breakfast... and of course the view! We spent a lot of time looking at Tokyo skyline. If you wonder if it's worth paying a little bit more to have a stunning view from one of the top floors, believe me, it is! I felt sick one of the evenings and could stay in bed watching sunset and then all the Tokyo lights, it was simply amazing.The king size bed is pretty big, maybe too big for a couple of honeymooners, believe me, you feel a little alone in the middle of that huge thing! About the bathroom, it was fantastic. There is both a shower and a bathtub (with jacuzzi!), you get bath salts, and high quality shampoo and body gel, bathrobes are comfy, though yukatas are surprisingly small and ugly.Housekeeping service turned out to be useful. You can get free ice, a new towel or any other thing almost immediately. There are free shuttles to the closest JR station (great when going to the airport). Also breakfast is amazing (though expensive). Lasagna might sound strange for breakfast but it was a real treat (and we hadn't had a real western meal for a while). Restaurants are incredibly expensive, definitely not worth it (1000 yens for a Coca Cola, really?), but the one in the 33rd floor has stunning views. And finally, the elevator ride.

Even the stunning view of the Tokyo Tower at the top floor bar (which is nice) is offset by the really, really tame atmosphereAll in all - good for a business hotel if office in area, but much better option in the city...","London, United Kingdom","Middleagedfamilydude</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",52,3.0

Stayed on the Premium floor which I think was worth the price. The premium lounge made it easy to grab a snack when you didn't want to deal with going out, and having breakfast in the lounge was a relaxed experience as opposed to the other breakfast areas which were a lot busier and hectic.After making the reservation, I did have a bit of anxiety about the hotel location; as mentioned in other reviews, it's not in the middle of everything. This worked out to be a blessing of sorts. The hotel is located in/near Shiba park, which contains a very nice temple complex which I read contains the oldest wooden structure in Tokyo. The setting is very peaceful, which we appreciated since we were running around town so much, in what ended up being the hottest September on record. The relatively new Oedo subway line, accessed at the Akabanebashi stop, got us almost everywhere we wanted to go. It's a line that takes you quickly and directly to the fish market, Roppongi and Shinjuku. You are also near the Shibakoen stop of another line that takes you near the Imperial Gardens/Tokyo station directly. Really, getting around could not have been easier on Tokyo's excellent spotless subway system. I recommend getting a Pasmo card at the subway station (a proximity type card, cash only) which will automatically take off the price of the subway ride. Also notable is that most ATMs don't take American ATM cards, so you will need to either go to a 7-11 or post office, both of which are very near the hotel. The concierge will help with that.One thing I found odd was the decor of the room. It had everything you could really need, and it was kept near spotless, but it looked like it was decorated by a Japanese grandma, which is so different than the public spaces of this hotel, which are very modern with glass, chrome and white marble. I guess this is geared more towards Japanese middle-aged tastes, as opposed to the decor you would fine the the Four Seasons near Tokyo Station or the Ritz in the new Midtown tower, which is more international. In some ways it added to the authenticity of the experience, instead of feeling like you are in a luxury hotel room in any large city. I will also add that I would not consider the room to be large, but we were able to storage our luggage reasonably out of the way, and the bathroom actually was quite big.Putting the decor of the room aside, everything else about the room was great. The bed was extremely comfortable and the bed linens were very good. Towels were good and the water pressure and hot water availability was excellent. Washlet toilet was a unique but recommended experience. Once we settled in, we appreciated the comfort of the room more and more. Keeping the room cool with the heat outside was a little spotty at times, but this really was not a big issue, particularly since we like our rooms really cool. The room view was EXCELLENT and a very good selling point.We got a very attractive rate by using the rate search function on Tripadvisor...it's worth checking out since we got something like 40 percent off the usual prohibitive price.The fitness complex/Japanese bath is pretty remote, but very nice. It's part of an extended conference complex attached via underground to the hotel which was used for a national election while we were visiting. We felt like we were part of history!Service was very helpful. Arranging for the bus back to Narita could not have been easier with the bellhop's help. Also, the hotel will hold your luggage up to 10 days, which we used for a 3 day getaway to Kyoto/Osaka. I have heard from others that the level of service in Asia is hard to beat, and I could not agree more. Get ready for a LOT of bowing, though!We loved the trip, and despite a wicked long flight and jet lag from which we are still recovering, we plan on returning. Would be open to other hotel options with our return, but if the Prince Park Tower ended up being a good deal, we would not hesitate in booking.","Chicago, Illinois","xiphe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",70,5.0

Disregarding a mistake assigning us a Smoking Room when I explicitly requested -while booking- a non-smoking one (that was solve very quickly) and not taking into consideration how expensive are the restaurants inside the Hotel (more than the average for Tokyo that is already very expensive in comparison with US standards), I have to recognize that this was the Top of the three hotels we staid in our trip that took us to Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo.I found and excellent deal in Orbitz and taking in consideration the high prices for taxis in Tokyo I choose -correctly- this Hotel that was relatively close to all the places I planned to visit (Yoyogi Park, Shibuya Crossing, East Garden and Imperial Palace, Ueno Park and his Museum of Nature and Science, Asakusa-Taito and Tsukiji Fish Market), this was the best option and I don't regret at all.You have to take advantage of the great hydromassage tube and will hallucinate with the high tech WC (this is for the first time visitors) that you will have in your room and the endless bath amenities they offer.Our room view was just great, in front of the Tokyo Tower in the 9th floor. I reserved an additional bed and it was just find for our crew. A little bit small for US standards but good enough for us.The breakfast buffet was expensive for our budget (around US$ 34 each) so we choose different options you have when you take the way to METRO DAIMON STATION.If you are planning to take 4 or more metro rides I suggest you to buy the Day Ticket that will save you money, time and convenience.The hotel was just excellent room service, Internet access and everything. They also have a convenience store in the Hotel Lobby, is a bit expensive that the regular ones but is an option.We didn't use the complementary bowling and swimming pool but they look great.

The bathroom was quite something to behold - marble walls, slate floor, huge mirrors, a roomy and powerful shower, jacuzzi bathtub and, not that I would normally comment on it but, a toilet that would turn Jimmy Saville green with envy; all gadgets, functions, features and powered everthing. Almost laugh-out-loud funny. Laundry and room service was polite and efficient to the point that it made me feel ashamed of what our own country has to offer, and should probably give American hotel services pause for thought. The bar, restaurant and breakfast costs would probably make an oil sheik cough his mints out, but the location means that you're only 5 minutes walk from Minato district which is food and drink heaven. Some great attractions also within walking distance - Tokyo Tower (5 minutes); a large, operational (is that the correct phrase?) Buddhist Temple (next door); a beautiful park (adjacent and next to the World Trade Centre); World Trade Centre (10 minutes); harbourside (12 minutes); Roppongi Hills district (1/2hr, or £5 taxi). One of addtional great features of this already great hotel is that it operates a low price coach service to and from Narita airport from in front of the hotel - about £30 each way - that is a thoroughly recommended alternative to the punishingly expensive taxi service (which comes in at an eye-watering £215 each way.

I grew up in Japan and North America so I understand both culture. I stayed here for the first time a few weeks ago, and you should be aware that I do NOT agree with most reviewers for the following reasons:1) Location - it's only great from the perspective that you are close to Tokyo Tower, but you are AWAY from everything else like shopping. Since Tokyo Tower can be accessed by train from anywhere in metro Tokyo, why stay close to Tokyo tower where there is nothing (not even great restaurants around there). Within walking distance, other than the Tokyo tower and a nice park, there is nothing else to see.2) Cleaniness - I was shocked to find some ""human hair"" (not head hair) around the basin area and generally, the room is outdated (early 2000 style) except for the semi-decent TV. The decor is awful, there are so many other hotels with better interior for the same price.3) Service - OK at best. When I complained about the hair problem and general cleaniness of the room, I got a different room but they never apologized. When I try to ship a luggage from the hotel to Narita airport (which is usually a 3 min task at places like Hilton), it took more than 45 minutes! 4) Noise - The place is congested because there are so many group tours. Not a quiet or pleasant place to be. 5) Cost - I paid about $220 which is ridiculous considering that for another $50 I could have stayed at Imperial hotel or Conrad Hilton (top hotels). This is not good value.Trust me, there are many other better hotels in more convenient locations such as Shinjuku Hilton or Shiodome Royal Park Hotel or Dai-ichi hotel in Ginza.

It was an amazing find. Was priced at $400 to 1000 dollars a day in the guide books - not sure why we were so lucky to get 4 days at that lower rate. Worth far more. Delightful, helpful concierge - made restaurant, event (tea ceremony, etc), and even next-city-destination hotel reservations for us, printed out maps, gave us excellent advice. Rooms exquisitely clean and beautiful - with even more beautful views. Great baths and amenities. Deep soaking tub with fragrant bath salts, awesome shower. Cool bidet toilet with heating and cleaning and massage options! Little gift of origami paper and paper crane on our arrival. Location excellent - a neat temple across the way walking distance from rail station (though they had free shuttle service!) and from sushi bars and restaurants and even a Starbucks! Close to the ever-lit Tokyo Tower - so a beacon was always there to guide us back to our hotel when on foot.

From the outside it isn't much but, the inside-wow! I am a bit of a hotel snob but this hotel met my expectations and more. It was clean, quiet and had a terrific bathtub that would be my absolute dream to own!. I got an incredible deal on this through hotels.com at $162. USD per night for a double-double on the 14th floor. We were on the 14th floor and had quite a nice view of the city. Tokyo Tower views were not available. As with any hotel in Japan, restaurants are quite expensive. Since this was the topper of our 11 day Japan trip, we splurged and had dinner at a beautiful Japanese restaurant in the hotel. The menu was authentic and we had many exotic dishes. Upon check-in they gave us discount vouchers for a tasting menu that was priced at $40 USD. If you are an adventurous eater, I would highly recommend using them (only 2 of us did). Everything else was a la carte and very pricey. With drinks and 6 people- 3 of them teens, our bill was $400. Then we went into a karaoke bar that had private rooms right across the hall and had quite a bit of sake and was great fun for the whole family. I must say that the teens had a terrific time and it was a real hoot, but there went another $400 USD. We were looking on these splurges as a 'once in a lifetime' indulgence and I'm glad we did it...once. We are not kin to Bill Gates but for 1 night, we lived and felt like we were.Room service again very expensive and there are not a lot of restaurants close by if unless you are up for walking a few blocks (I have mobility issues), except in Tokyo Tower which does have a food court but it geared to tourists, even hosting a McDonald's. The Tokyo Tower experience was nice but it IS NOT equipped to handle patrons with mobility issues as it has stairs. I would recommend one of the bus tours that can be arranged by the concierge- who was extremely helpful. You can see the sights and then you get dropped off in neighborhoods if you wish and you can kick around on your own. My only drawbacks were the expensive restaurants and the lack of things for teens to do. Luckily it was near a train station and Tokyo is a very safe city so my teens came and went even in the evenings. If traveling without kids, I would recommend without hesitation for a few days. There is a fitness center and indoor pool but you have to be 20 years of age to use it. There is Tokyo Tower and a beautiful shrine and gardens right next door. Avoid Tokyo Tower during the day unless you go on Sunday due to the large school groups. You are probably not going to see Mt. Fuji anyway unless you are in Japan on a cool, clear day and those are quite rare. I would go at night but DO NOT go if you can't do stairs. I'm glad I stayed at this luxury hotel as a treat but I would not stay there again as I have 'been there, done that'.

There are two subway stations within five minutes walk. Although these are not on the main Toyko line the hotel does provide a free shuttle service to another station that is. The shuttle runs about every 15 minutes or so.We were staying here for a couple of days before going on a cruise departing from just outside Yokohama. I approached the concierge and told him that I would like to get to the cruise terminal by train and asked him the best way. He immediately took us in to his office and 5 minutes later we had directions printed in English and Japanese telling us which trains to catch, which line they were on, and even how much each train would cost.Extremely helpful. As were all of the staff here. We had dinner one night at the Chinese restaurant in the hotel. I have to say I didn't enjoy it. This is in no way a reflection of the hotel or restaurant, just that it did not appeal to my taste. Now the boulangerie , that was a different matter.

That's not a good sign in service-obsessed Tokyo, but since the hotel had been booked as part of a package it wasn't possible to change it, unfortunately.The lobby was encouraging - very new-looking, glass, chrome and marble. Check-in was a pain - although it was conducted sitting down at a desk, it took ages when really it should just have been a matter of copying our passports and collecting the hotel voucher etc. The rooms were a good size and it was nice to have a little balcony looking out onto the Shiba park & Tokyo Tower, but the furnishings were very dated and my wife was a bit put off by a rather prominent & suspicious-looking white stain on the purple sofa. There seemed little point in mentioning it to the hotel though as it would most likely have meant moving all four of us to new rooms which would have been a waste of time. The bed was very comfortable. The hotel had a 'green' scheme whereby you could offer to not have your room cleaned and receive a credit of so many yen per day - but they wanted us to waive all cleaning (ie no fresh towels, no clean bins etc) which is too much. Bizarrely like many hotels now they ask if you want fresh towels that you put them in the bath, so we religiously hung ours back up when we didn't feel we needed new ones - and they changed them anyway!!The following morning we made the mistake of not reading the little breakfast vouchers we'd been given, so we went to the basement Chinese restaurant for breakfast; it was not good - the floor of the restaurant was sticky, presumably following a party the night before or something, and the food was not great. We complained but we're not sure they really understood why we weren't happy. The next day we found out we should have gone to the top-floor international buffet, which was quite a bit better, although sometimes we had to queue for a table.We didn't eat any other meals in the hotel.The other major disappointment was the following. One of the reasons we'd selected this hotel from the choices offered by the agent was that it had a pool and our kids like to swim after a day of sight-seeing. But when we tried to use it, we were told it was only open to people over 25 years old! We complained and they were apologetic but very firm that it was not possible for us to use the pool.The location is not tremendously convenient if you are out and about a lot as it's not very near any subway (there are a couple of stations but they're all 5+ minutes walk) so as a regular traveller to Tokyo on business I would not choose this hotel.Although the rooms are larger than is typical in a Tokyo I'm going to go back to the other place I stay next time I'm there as I thought this place was a disappointment.","Jersey, United Kingdom","RusNewton</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jersey, United Kingdom</strong>",246,3.0

We booked our room with hotels.com. We were upgraded upon check in, and were placed in a corner room on the 20th floor. Fantastic views...and free visits to the hotel gym (with large pool)!Positives:- Outstanding staff, large rooms, great hotel store (we often got breakfast here, pastries, water, etc. Open late too), nice gym with fantastic pool (inside a huge pool hall), bathrooms were open and spacious, the hotel was placed on extensive grounds (meaning that hotel sat on a plot of land surrounded by gardens, vs. other hotels that stood next to other buildings), safe and secureThings to keep in mind:- You will probably need to walk for 10-15 mins to find restaurants and bars (the hotel restaurants are typically expensive). But the surrounding area is very safe and easy to walk, so we didnt mind.- We used the Akabanebashi subway stop. You will definitely need a subway map. The Tokyo subway lines are extensive, convenient, and cost effective ($1.50 USD per ride?). However, they can be confusing at first, so make sure to have a map.- We never used taxis. A taxi to the airport would've been about 20,000 yen, or about $200 usd. The airport shuttle is the best way to get to Narita airport, at about 3,000yen (about $30) per person).

We did hear motorcycles at night sometimes but I suspect it to be better than the traffic noise you'd hear at other Tokyo downtown hotels. This one is in a quiet park! Other reviewers noted that there are no restaurants nearby, which is true. Also, we always took a taxi to/from the JR station, because you have to book the hotel's shuttle otherwise it's full. The taxi allowed us to go at our own times without pre-booking and was only about $8. Easy access from the JR station to other areas of the city by train.

We wanted the best deal possible, so we also had to use two twin beds.Regarding the location, it's near the Tokyo Tower but I found that the only benefit to being in the southern part of Tokyo. If you're using the JR Rail Pass, it's definitely possible to avoid using other (non-JR) subways in Tokyo, but it's a 15-20 minute walk to this hotel from the JR line. Coming from the airport (if this is your starting location) is not too difficult (only one transfer at Tokyo Station), but the food choices in the area are somewhat limited.

We had booked a triple room for 3 adults, so we ended up with 2 king singles and a single bed. The room was quite spacious, but on the first night, we could just barely hear some talking from the adjoining room. With our 2 relatively small kids, we actually slept 1 adult + 1 child in each of the single beds. The wardrobe was very spacious so we kept one of our large suitcases in there.The room had the best toilet we had in our Japan trip - the lid automatically opened when you entered the toilet cubicle, and it automatically flushed too! Bath was much enjoyed by the kids after days of walking around. There was also free wired internet in the room to help plan your next day. Also loved how the corridor lights only turned on when you walked in that direction. Smart :)The service was very good here - too polite. When checking in, they had someone at the front of the first queue to direct you to a free desk/station. But they were all busy so this person invited me to take a seat nearby. But for only 30 seconds! The concierges were helpful with directions and instructions (eg. wanted to buy tickets to the Ghibli museum and they even printed out instructions from the web for us!). There is a hotel lobby shop with a bakery where we bought our cheap pastries for breakfast and drinks and snacks for the day and evening. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurants.In terms of location, the hotel is near 2 different lines and the stations are very short walks away. We used these subway stations for most for our trips around Tokyo. Wasn't a problem walking back with the 2 kids at night (especially getting a nice view of the Tokyo Tower each time).You can also book to go on the free shuttle bus which brings you to the nearest JR station (Hamamatsucho). We actually took this shuttle bus to the hotel from the JR station when we arrived - just make sure you get to the right JR station exit. Besides this, it's a bit of a walk to the JR station and other external restaurants in that area (if you have young kids). There is a Lawson's a few blocks away (if you need to get Ghibli museum tickets). We booked the Airport Shuttle to get back to the airport, and it stopped at this hotel. This hotel has a green program where you can opt to not get your bed made/towels changed for a 1000 yen voucher. We did this a few times and it paid for some breakfast and gifts from the hotel shop.Great value for money (the price we got made this hotel nearly AUD$200 cheaper per night than our Kyoto hotel and a ryokan we stayed at). Might have been more convenient to be located in a major shopping/restaurant area, but with subways so closeby and the price, I can't complain.","Perth, WA","JasePerth_WA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, WA</strong>",19,5.0

What you need to keep in mind is that the first 17 or so floors are probably 3-4 star and the floors above are 5 star. That said, our room was very clean and spacious, just not as pretty and modern as some of the advertised pictures suggest. The customer service, like every place in Japan (even 7-11's) is amazing. My husband was disappointed that NO tattoos are allowed at the fitness center (there are large beautiful gardens surrounding for a morning run). They offered a ""green option"" where you get 1000 Yen certificate ( ~ $10 at the time of our trip to be used in the hotel) for every day you do not need maid service (up to three days in a row). We used ours at the beautiful 33rd floor lounge (1000 Yen cover charge). You need to call them before 8 a.m. for this. Our rooms had the twin sized beds and my husband and I were disappointed you couldn't move them together (bolted to the walls). The convenience store had snacks and drinks including alcohol for okay prices. The snacks and drinks within the room were very expensive. The tap water is potable and we would refill our water bottles before heading out. The restaurants were all very expensive (i.e. 1700 Yen for a ham and cheese sandwich). Shuttle to major subway station and walking distance to other stations. Airport shuttle service (Airport Limousine - orange signs) to and from the hotel was 3000 Yen each way (you can get one easily from the airport and reserve one at the Hotel a few days in advance). This hotel is right near the fabulous Tokyo Tower - try to get a view of it from your hotel if you can. Otherwise, enjoy it from the 33rd floor lounge. I would still recommend this hotel as long as you know what you are getting into. No free wi-fi - free internet only if connected via wire to laptop.

My husband & I booked through Continental Airlines and got a good rate. We had a corner room on the 26th floor for 8 nights. The room had a fantastic view of the city, we could even see Mount Fuji on a clear day (alas not many whilst we were in Tokyo). The bathroom was really big, shower was excellent and, as others have reported, the toilet had aheated seat and other gadgetry. We were never disturbed by hotel noise, just general traffic out on the roads but that wasn't a problem. The bed was classed as a double but I am sure it was a king size. The pillows, bedding etc were excellent and we slept well. We had breakfast in our room a few times and the service was excellent. No wireless internet, surprising but the wired service was fast and worked well. The hotel has numerous restaurants, we loved the steakhouse, Kobe beef best we have ever tasted, service very good, everything cooked in front of you. Chinese restaurant was not so good, too bright, no atmosphere, food lukewarm and service not brilliant, bit of a surprise really as that was the only bad thing we had to say about our stay at the hotel. The coffee/cake lounge very relaxing, good service, buffet breakfast excellent, fantastic views, some queues in the morning but the line moved fast while we were there. The charge is 3000Yen, expensive maybe, but this is a top hotel and theres plenty to eat and remember NO TIPPING, it all adds up. The tasting corner very good idea, my husband sampled some sakes one evening before dinner. The American breakfast restaurant did not have a great menu but if theres a line at the buffet its another option. This hotel has a shop that sells snacks, cakes, pastries, savouries, gifts, magazines, toiletries etc, another shop selling various attire, a full spa offering a great range of treatments. Full wedding service, florist , chapel etc which looked very impressive. Pool, gym, we didn't use either but I believe there was a charge for the gym. 2000Yen I think. Oh and theres a bowling alley, its a good size too, impressive, unsure how busy it gets and whether you have to book, there was also an electronic dart board in there too. Lastly the conceirge was excellent. Yoko organised all our tours, followed up with further suggestions and we were very pleased with the effort and detail she put into arranging things for us. I would recommend the private taxi with English speaking driver. Its money well spent. We took the full day Greyline city tour one day and quite frankly it was awful, although Micki our tour guide was very good, she spoke good English, but it wasn't organised very well. It ran from 8am pick up and due to delays we didn't get back to the hotel until 7pm, far too long hanging around waiting for other buses to swop over with us etc. only 10 minutes in Imperial gardens and a horrible boat tour, packed in like sardines, no safety info, hard to see anything on a tour like that. Not worth the money. Do not recommend this tour. Next day we spent 5.5hrs with Takumi our private driver in a very smart comfortable car going where we wanted and getting lots of interesting information, he even went back to the car for umbrellas for us when it looked like rain. We booked for 4hrs but he was happy for us to extend it. We also did the bullet train to Kyoto, with Sunrise tours, it was excellent, everything went well. So use the concierge at this hotel, they are very knowledgable and have a lot of folders/maps under the desk with a wealth of information for you. We felt the hotel was a good location. It s right on top of Tokyo Tower and a little park. It was about 10minute walk to Daimon tube station. This was a nice walk, safe etc and past a park and temple. There is also a free shuttle from the hotel to main bus terminal and another station much closer to the hotel, unsure of the name. Few minutes walk to plenty of restaurants, and Starbucks also only about 7 minutes on the way to the tube station. (If you want a change from green tea. We went all over the city on the tube, the ticket machines have an english button to translate everything for you. The hotel staff in the lobby will explain all this for you if you ask them and give you a good map. Its a good hotel, you get what you pay for, its not cheap but look for deals and you'll get good value for the quality of service and comfort. and don't forget theres no tipping in Japan, think how much you save on that.","Lake Mary, Florida","spangle1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake Mary, Florida</strong>",96,5.0

Here are the details:Location: Close to the Tokyo Tower and next to Shiba park and the Zojoji temple. 5 min walk to the nearest subway station (Akabanebashi) from where we took the subway for all our sightseeing in Tokyo. Found it easier to take the airport limousine bus from Narita to reach the hotel. This is one of the last hotels on the airport bus route - so it can take close to 2 hours to reach the hotel. Preferred to take a taxi to Tokyo station when we left the hotel to catch the shinkansen to Osaka.Room: We stayed in a corner room with a double bed. Room was very clean and nice but a bit smaller than I expected. Not the smallest room I have stayed in while in Japan but smaller than most rooms elsewhere in the world. We decided not to ask for a baby cot for our 1 year old daughter because there was no space to put in an extra cot. Bath was very nice with a separate shower stall and bathtub and the toilet was very high-tech! Internet was free which was a great relief after having paid extra for internet access in other hotels in Japan. Smaller sized LCD TV and a couple of English channels (CNN & BBC) apart from the Japanese channels.Service: Very helpful concierge and reception staff who spoke good English. Was disappointed though with their policy of not allowing us to check-in a couple of hours earlier than 2pm despite seeing that we were travelling with a 1 year old and had just reached Tokyo after a long-haul flight. There were rooms available, so that was not the issue - they insisted though that they would charge us extra for the earlier check-in. Food: we did not eat at the hotel except for the breakfast buffet which was included in our package. 3 different options for the breakfast buffet - 1 western style buffet in the Sky Bar, 1 Japanese buffet and a mixed buffet (western, japanese and chinese) in the restaurants. We tried two of the options but the quality of the western buffet was not upto our expectations. Can't comment about the Japanese or Chinese options. There are a couple of nice eating places within a 15min walk from the hotel but the options are limited compared to other locations in Tokyo.We would recommend the hotel for leisure and business travel especially if you are keen to stay at a quieter location in Tokyo.","Singapore, Singapore","v2r1v2r1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",4,4.0

So as the conference I was attending for the second time was being held at the hotel again, I was very keen to stay once more. As many have noted, the Airport Limousine bus from Narita does stop at the hotel, and it's great if you have a lot of luggage and don't want to be transferring on trains. However, since this time I was coming in by myself, I decided to take the NEX train, because if you take the bus, the Prince Hotel Park Tower is the last stop so the bus trip actually does take almost 2 hours. I bought a ticket to Hamamatsucho Station at the Narita Terminal 2 along with the premium one must pay to ride the NEX train - cost me Y3,110. I got off the Nex at Tokyo Station, and transfered to the Yamanote Line (Keihin Tohoku works too) and arrived at Hamamatsucho 2 or 3 stops later. I could have tried to figure out the times for the bus to pick me up from the station, but when I got to Hamamatsucho I just decided to walk because it was a really nice night, and arrived at the hotel less than 20 minutes later (heading west from the station towards the Zozoji Temple).The hotel was terrific, again. I got a smaller room this time, but it was still very nice, on the 10th floor. The bed was very comfortable, the Internet was free and the bathroom was nice and large. It had a bathtub where one could flip one switch, and runs a bath at the perfect temperature, and shuts off automatically. The pastries at the Boulangerie Tokyo were as good as I remembered, and having the store there made it irrelevant that the nearest convenience store was about a 10 minute walk. I went one day to the area just a little past Akabanebashi station, in Azabu-Juban, and thought that was very nice and atmospheric. Another night, I walked with a friend to an excellent tonkatsu restaurant not far from Daimon station with specialty pork from Tochigi prefecture (www.musashiya.net), the proprietor doesn't speak much English but is incredibly nice and helpful. This time, knowing the area a little better, I really appreciated everything it had to offer. I highly recommend the hotel and certainly plan on staying there again.","Hong Kong, China","David W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",230,5.0

Back to Tokyo again for a two night stay for Tokyo Girls Collection 2010, at which my daughter is a guest star. The hotel looks slightly retro from the outside, but once into the lobby, it is pure 21st Century. A stunning atrium rises twenty floors or more, glass lifts smoothly lifting guests to their allotted room. Check in is rapid and efficient . A very elegant female porter escorts us to our room and drops off the suitcases. No tipping, as is the way in Japan, just a member of staff which the rest of the world could learn from. The standard of the room, overlooking the freeway, is immaculate. Two comfortable beds, plenty of space, and the expected amenities and standards of cleanliness. The loo is separate from the bathroom, and is like something from Buck Rogers. It opens the lid as soon as you step in the room, and intuitively knows when to flush. Spooky. The bathroom sports an excellent shower and an air spa bath, along with top line toiletries. Unfortunately, due to the place being booked out, we can only stay the one night here, but we will be back. The complex goes on for what seems miles, and the spa looks excellent. As with all top end hotels, the prices for food and drink are, in my opinion, unnecessarily extortionate. Why is it that nobody in this industry will cotton on to the fact that if they were more competitive in their costs then more people wouldn't leave the building and eat out - which we always do.

The view from my room was of Tokyo Tower which looks awesome at night time with all the different coloured lights.Check-in was easy and efficient. All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful when required. The hotel shop is quite good and the bakery has some very delicious items that I would highly recommend. Location wise - the hotel is is a quieter are of Tokyo - so if you want to be right in the middle of the hustle and bustle - then I would stay in Shinjuku or Shibuya. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the nearest JR station on the Yamanote line - Hamamatsucho - but there are subway stations that are closer also. There is a free shuttle every 30 minutes that runs to the JR station.Overall I was very happy with my stay here. I would recommend others to stay here but it would definitely depend on what room rate you can get - I managed to get a rate less than 30% of the rack rate - which was great.","Brisbane, Australia","roundtheworld4me</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",24,5.0

The location was quite good given that it was only a few minutes from the subway station. It is on the Oedo line which takes you to Shinjuku and Roppongi without changing lines. We were also upgraded to very nice room with a great panoramic view of Tokyo. For japan standards, the room was huge and had good amenities like Nepresso machines with free pods etc. Communication with the hotel prior to arrival was quite challenging. There was no email address on the hotel site - only a web form. However, no one seems to receive the emails from the web form as our 3 email attempts were ignored. Upon our arrival, the local staff were very apologetic. The biggest issue we had with the hotel is the concierge service. We had only a limited number of nights in Tokyo and wanted to make the most out of it by going to some Michelin starred restaurants for dinner. The concierge booked us into the wrong restaurant (I mean, shouldn't they know which ones are Michelin starred?) and so we ended up dressed up, paying for a taxi, arriving at the restaurant only to find that they didn't have our reservation. Ended up eating at some roadside sushi place which was still good... but we were pretty pissed off about it. The staff were very apologetic and tried to make the best out of the situation but I would not recommend this hotel if you are planning to ask the concierge to make lots of bookings for you!Also... what is the deal with hotels not offering WiFi?

We stayed in a standard twin room on the 11th floor overlooking the temple and park. The room was perfectly adequate, with plenty of room, comfortable beds and a very spacious bathroom with large separate tub and shower. The electric toilet seat with it's various bidet settings and heated seat was fun too.The hotel is located in a non touristy area of Tokyo which we preferred but is still extremely easy to get to all the major areas. There are two subway stations within a five minute walk, really very close and one in Hammatsucho which is under fifteen minutes and is also a main JR station. The area of Hammatsucho has plenty of reasonably priced restaurant options if you don't want to travel back to the busier areas. We liked staying in this location as it felt more authentic and consequently prices were aimed at Tokyoites rather than tourists. The service in the hotel was excellent but this was the case everywhere we went in Tokyo as people really seem to take pride in their work. We also took advantage of the Green Cleaning program, if you go without housekeeping for two consecutive nights you are given credit to use at the hotel. By the end of our stay we had about $60 worth of coupons which we used in the gift shop/bakery. We didn't try any of the restaurants at the hotel as they were so expensive and there are plenty of options nearby if you don't mind exploring a bit. For example if you walk like you are going to the Akabanebashi station but turn left under the bridge before you get to the station and walk down the major road for about fifteen minutes or so on your left you will come to a street full of restaurants and this brings you into the Mita area. I also liked that the housekeeping staff came to our room one day at 4pm to clean as we had accidentally left our do not disturb sign on and they couldn't access it earlier. I would imagine in other places in the world they would have said we were too late that day. We found a great Chinese restaurant in Ginza called X'ian I would highly recommend, fresh ingredients, busy and a great price. My favorite places to visit in Tokyo were Asakusa and Ueno, both great for wandering around and seeing a more traditional Tokyo, with great street food and lots of alleys and streets to explore. Also Ginza and Shinjuku., especially Yakatori Alley in Shinjuku for an authentic japanese after work drinking culture experience. Roppongi was a little seedy and the restaurants in the new shopping complexes like Roppongi Hills are overpriced. Tokyo is such a safe, clean, efficient city and nowhere near as complicated to navigate as people might say. The subway is well marked in English with signs at every exit and there are large maps posted in major areas when you exit the subway.

This made the Prince Park Tower way less expensive than any other 5-star hotel within the main areas of inner Tokyo for the dates of our stay, excellent value for money. However, while the hotel mostly deserves its 5* rating and has many very good features, it does have some drawbacks. The greatest drawback, and probably the reason the hotel frequently has good deals available, is that its location, realistically, is far from ideal – certainly, for the needs of most tourists. It is about a 20 minutes walk from the nearest JR train station, Hamamatsucho. There are a couple of subway stations that are closer, but these lines do not connect directly to many of the destinations most tourists wish when sightseeing in Tokyo. (We were fully aware of this issue, having been to Tokyo before so knew where it was located, and had borne this in mind when we made our booking.) The distance from the JR train station is mitigated slight by a complimentary shuttle bus service, but this is shared by the other nearby Prince hotel - so there is a risk that the bus may already be full when it arrives to take guests to the station, and the journey to the hotel has to go via the other hotel, when you work out where the pick-up is.Further, the hotel is not in an area of good or interesting restaurants. The best and biggest selection in walking distance are on the walk from the banqueting entrance of the hotel to Hamamatsucho JR train station, but you do need to use public transport to find better options and a wider choice. You either need to take the JR Yamanote Line one stop to Shimbashi and head towards Ginza or the Toei line subway to Roppongi for an greater, more Westerner and tourist friendly choice of restaurants, bars and other evening entertainment.The good features worth mentioning include: The hotel staff – everybody is very well trained, very courteous and polite, efficient and helpful. They also all speak good English, except seemingly the drivers of the shuttle bus service to the JR train station.The setting – it’s effectively within Shiba park so it is surrounded by a lot of greenery with pleasant areas for a stroll, and it is right beside Zojo-ji temple, where some of the most popular New Year celebrations take place, which is worth a little exploration.The bedroom - it was a very good size for a standard room, the largest we encountered in any hotel in a major city. The décor was fairly neutral, clean and fresh. We were able to fully unpack all our luggage and find somewhere appropriate to store all our clothes, toiletries and other paraphernalia – no mean feat this is Japan! The beds were huge, very firm and comfy and had the best quality cotton linens we have encountered in a hotel for a long time. The windows were huge and the doors onto the narrow, balcony actually opened – unusual when you’re on the 18th floor! The black out drapes really did work – we needed to set the alarm, even on very sunny mornings. The flat screen TV was huge and received several satellite channels including the usual suspects, eg. CNN and BBC News24. Almost unheard of for a 5 star hotel, the in-room wireless internet was free of charge, and they even provided a LAN cable, too.The bathroom – this too was very spacious. There was a separate shower cubicle and bathtub. The shower enclosure was a very good size and the shower good and powerful and there was even space inside to rest personal products. The tub was the longest and deepest encountered in Japan and had Jacuzzi jets built in. Sensibly, and a nice touch – they provided lovely smelling bath salts that do not foam to enhance a soak after a day foot slogging your way around the stores and major sights of Tokyo.The vanitory unit was wide with room for some personal care items, but they also provided a wheeled cart to hold more. The mirror behind this was heated so never steams up, however long you stand in the shower! The toilet was in a separate small room. The light came on automatically as you opened the door and the seat lifted, and it flushed automatically after use. The control panel to operate the toilet and all its wondrous features would not have looked out of place on a starship!As you would expect of any 5* hotel in Tokyo, the prices in the restaurants and bars are high. However, you do get what you pay for. If you wish one splurge in the hotel, treat yourself to a cocktail in the Sky Lounge on the 33rd floor when it’s not raining. You get great night-time views directly onto the Tokyo Tower and the Rainbow Bridge in the distance. (You can, if you take advantage of the hotel’s green eco programme and don’t have your room cleaned in return for vouchers, trade these against the drinks bill!)The patisserie off the main lobby, which also took the vouchers, sold breakfast goods at a fair price, if you wished to avoid the hotel breakfast charges or only wanted a lighter bite. The atmosphere perhaps of the restaurants was very ‘hotellish’ rather than tasteful or cozy, and some of the public spaces looked rather old fashioned, but were clean, bright and spacious.Obviously, it is a very large hotel. It is used by large groups, so there are times when the lobby is quite crowded and noisy, but the efficient staff handled them very effectively so this wasn’t an issue. Overall, it was a great place the stay, and we’d go back.","Lewes, United Kingdom","SussexWorldtraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lewes, United Kingdom</strong>",102,4.0

I felt like I was a Princess living in my Palace. The only negative if anything is just that it is hard to move around from the hotel to other attractioins. We have to get a bus from the hotel convenient but doesnt leave as often as we would have liked and we never figured out how to get the bus from the station back to the hotel so we had to get a taxi back. So the location was a tad inconvenient in getting to the station (it is a long walk trust me) and getting to attractions, however the neighboring area is pretty and the park downstairs next to the temple is very awesome. The tour buses to get to tour things do stop there it is a major hotel so that is very convenient.The restaurants are great, the food is great (the Chinese restaurant is just awesome (expensive but the food is still in my mind after all these months. We still talk about it.)). The spa was amazing and considerably cheap!

The rooms are excellent, roomy and well equipped and the extras are fantastic -including free champagne in the room, free afternoon tea and drinks in the special lounge on the 32nd floor with brilliant views of the Tokyo Tower and across Tokyo, free and good internet access and free use of the spa and the 10 pin bowling in the basement.

I have stayed in all classes of hotels. I stayed at this hotel because I got an industry travel package This hotel is located in Minato-ku but not in the center. The entrance is nice and the staff is very courteous There is a language barrier even with those that do speak English. The breakfast was not great but the view was wonderful and again the service is great. We only tried the American one. The coffee is really good.The room is 3.5* and the hotel is dated but nice enough. The bathroom is fine, toiletries are very generic--no lotion so make sure to bring. Bed is comfortable enough.I got a massage in the room and it was awful. I got another in Le Temps on the lower level and it was wonderful. We did not check out the spa, but you have to pay to use it. Yes, I have had massages all over Asia and am familiar with the difference styles.There is no wifi available, not even in the lobby. But there is a business center right behind the concierge desk--250 yen for 15 minutes.My issues with the hotel were the location and the difficulties presented by the language barrier-- it was hard to find restaurants and our way around. For example, the 1st night we arrived we asked the concierge where we should go to eat, drink, etc. Mind you, it was raining outside. They sent us to Daimon crossing, on foot, which I later realized is the Minato central area. This is all outside and all the signs are in Japanese. We wandered around for quite awhile, jetlagged, at night, in the rain trying to find a restaurant. I personally love a good adventure and this was ok at the time--not ideal but when in Rome (or Tokyo)... But another day, we went to Roppongi which is just 2 stops over on the train and there is a mall there, indoors, with a lot of trendy restaurants and bars with English translations more available...(if you're not familiar with Asia... it is normal for the good restaurants to be located on the upper floor of malls and the lower floors) why didn't they send us there?? I think it's because they were probably too limited by the language and so did not attempt to tell us to take the train to Roppongi. That would have definitely changed the entire experience for us... because after that 1st night my friend was very intimidated by the restaurant situation and it made things difficult.They never even told us where the metro station is. We discovered it on our own. They sent us to a JR Line train station which is further from the hotel (not by much but still after walking around all day...) and has less accessibility to the metro lines. So, if you're staying here. When you exit the hotel turn right and go to the intersection. The Akabanashi metro stop is diagonally to your left underneath the overpass. From there you can go to Roppongi, 2 stops or Diamon, 2 stops or connect to other places.There are no restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, you have to travel. If you're trying to decide where to stay. I would say that Roppongi is a very nice area and the Hilton looks fabulous. Or in Ginza, there is a Peninsula, the Imperial, and a few others I forget the names of. Ginza is like 5th avenue and very nice--and right next to the imperial gardens.

I was given a room on the 27th floor on one of the superior floors which I could access through a separate lift. I was so stunned when I saw the room that I was left speechless. There was a huge window from one end of the room to the other that had a spectacular view across Tokyo city. After the view, then I noticed the room - the bed was big enough to comfortably sleep 6 people. There was a living area, kitchenette with kettle and Nespresso machine, separate toilet (with all the usual buttons, and a warm seat), and jacuzzi bath in a large bathroom with a full set of toiletries. Wow.The hotel is in a non touristy location, which I liked, but within 5 mins of two tube stations - Akanabashi and Shiba-Koen, both on Toie subway lines. A previous reviewer said that the nearest station was a 10 minute walk away, but he was referring to Daimon/Hamamatsucho, which are not the closest stations. Also, the hotel is supremely easy to get to from Haneeda airport. The monorail goes straight from this airport to Hamamatsucho, and its a short, cheap (Y710 min fare at night) taxi ride away if you have too much luggage for the 10min walk.My big disappointment was the breakfast. The buffet breakfast just wasn't that impressive in terms of choice or quality, for the price (Y3000). After a couple of days I tried the Japanese breakfast in the basement instead for the same price, but it was all too new and too different for me to be able to stomach at that time in the morning. The staff at this hotel are wonderful, and in particular the concierge desk. Every person I asked for help went far out of their way to help me. One staff member even wrote and then printed a map and directions in Japanese that I could give to a taxi driver to find my work location the next day.The gym was not impressive - it seemed a little old, with few machines and poor air-con. Also very expensive at Y2000 a session. Use of swimming pool, another Y2000 on top! Surely a hotel of this standard should offer complimentary gym and pool?Overall though, I highly rate this hotel, and if I could get the same deal on price that I did this time - 50% discount through Expedia, then I would be delighted to return and stay here again.",London,"isis109</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",33,5.0

Fabulously done up, very luxurious decor and impressive communal areas. We went in through the wrong entrance and realised how massive this hotel is - there's even a bowling alley! Staff very helpful and sweet. Shame the pool was so much extra. Our room was a ""comfort king"" and was enourmous - the biggest bed I have ever seen. Bathroom was lovely with a jacuzzi bath. Handy bakery and reasonably priced shop at the entrance - we used that instead of taking the v pricey breakfast, although I'm sure it would have been great, if your company is paying! Room had a fab view of the Tokyo tower. A little out of the way as it is a 10 min walk to the nearest station (free line with the JR pass), but there is a bus every hour run by the hotel if you time it right. It was easy to use the trains, and didn't take long from Tokyo station having used the Narita airpot express trains. The C&C japanese fast food curry place on the main road to the station from the hotel was surprisingly good with a friendly English speaking waiter!Would definitely recomend this hotel if you don't mind being a little away from the central hub of everything, but it was nice and peaceful so we quite liked that.

I was pretty tired so wasn't relishing the thought of lugging anything anywhere at that point.I was whisked into the lobby and seated while a gentleman quickly sorted out my one night reservation only to be told that I was being upgraded to a special room in an exclusive area of the hotel, accessible only by a special card that you used to enter. A lady took me to my room on the 26th floor and even as tired as I was, I was blown away by the city skyline view when you showed me how the curtains opened automatically with just a push of a button. The lights of Tokyo shimmered for miles beyond my balcony, which she also demonstrated, was actually usable.The lights knew when you were in a room by turning on automatically and I was treated, for the first time in my life, to a toilet seat that was actually heated. The toilet could do all sorts of other things but I left it at that.The room was very spacious, had a built in work desk, mini bar, a small seating area and an expresso machine. The bed was luxuriously comfortable with a thread count beyond anything I have ever experienced. Frankly, I never wanted to leave....Last but not least, I managed to get this hotel at an excellent price on the internet (about $170 Canadian including taxes). It was highly recommended by my daughter and her boyfriend who stayed there for one night upon their arrival in Japan and I am thrilled that I took their recommendation. I also read the reviews on Trip Advisor and was happy to have discovered the bakery just off the reception for breakfast the next morning. I'm afraid I can't comment on the convenience of the location because I was (most unfortunately) in and out, but it was about a $20 cab ride to the train station which is where I headed after checking out.If you ever go to Tokyo, want first class luxury in a most accommodating hotel, then the Park Prince Tower Hotel should be your first choice.",montreal,"cubafriendMontreal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>montreal</strong>",191,5.0

Our guest room at the Prince was completely comfortable. We stayed at the Prince following our arrival in Japan from California. As you probably know, the westerly flight from L.A. to Tokyo is somewhat brutal. The Prince is an ideal location to try to shake the travel-related stupor that usually follows lengthly flights. The room was quiet, the bed comfortable, and the bathroom luxurious. The location is excellent - though not in the middle of a touristy neighborhood. Easy walking distance to a handful of subway stations and lines. I recommend attempting to figure out the lay of the land during the daytime (and not immediately after getting off the plane). If you take the JR Line to Hamamatsucho with your suitcases, it could be a little challenging finding the hotel in the dark. Instead, take the Narita Express to Tokyo Station and take a taxi to the hotel (1500 yen approximately).",Los Angeles,"Flankster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",67,5.0

You don't need to bring any toiletries: toothbrushes, mouthwash, combs, brushes, hairbands, razors, and luxurious l'Occitane shampoos, conditioners, shower gels, and body lotions were provided. Also: best hair dryer I've ever used (and I've used some); it was quiet and it didn't seem powerful but my hair dried really fast and remained frizz-free in the high September humidity.For your computers, if your plug is 3-pronged, just call down for an adapted and they'll bring one up to you (for free -- unless you lose it) in a flash. A cord for the high-speed connection was already provided in the room (the girl who showed me my room brought it out of the desk drawer immediately).Service was unlike anything else I've ever seen. Very polite, warm and friendly... eager to please. I approached the hotel with 2 shopping bags in each hand from a day in Ginza, and a bell hop hurried toward me to take my bags and bring them up to my room for me. One day I asked the concierge how I could go about sending a bottle of wine (a thank-you gift) to a colleague in Tokyo, and before I knew it she was filling out a courrier form and wrapping the bottle in bubble-wrap for me, etc. Unbelievable!Food in the hotel was quite good (except food that tried to imitate American food... just stick to the Japanese food) but overpriced -- go elsewhere for main meals.... but the bakery/gift shop on the first floor was extremely useful. Every morning I started my day there for a fruit smoothie and a small bite to eat before heading out for my day. It's also open till 1 a.m. so it makes for a great late-night snack if you're jet-lagged and watching Japanese variety shows on your enormous flat screen tv.The hotel was also very well located. Don't believe anyone who says the subways are far; that must be an extremely lazy person! There are two subways nearby: Shibakoen which is right on the other side of the park, and Daimon (which I used the most) which was less than a 5 minute walk away in a very clean and very safe neighbourhood (mostly salarymen around). If you have any doubts, the concierge will be only too happy to whip out an area map and a subway map to draw you the very short route, and even tell you what's the easiest way to get to your destination.I fully intend to visit Tokyo again, and when I do, I fully intend to stay at the Prince Park Tokyo Tower. It was a great deal (after all, I'm a graduate student and am not rolling in dough...yet, hehe), and I couldn't have asked for better service and luxury even if I'd paid twice as much. You'll also appreciate that it's surrounded by a park; I'd considered staying at the Cerulean Tower hotel, but when I walked by it in Shibuya, I was happy I wasn't staying in such a busy (and somewhat smelly) area. I had somewhere peaceful but still central to unwind and relax.","Toronto, Canada","Celeste P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",54,5.0

The bed was huge, and there was a separate couch and seating area. The balcony overlooked the Tokyo skyline and Tower - very cool! Included with our room were some breakfast vouchers.The first day we had a traditional Japanese breakfast which was - interesting. Nothing like having grilled fish at 9am in the morning! Glad to say that I tried it but not really my cup of tea. Had breakfast in the Verte area the rest of the stay. There was obviously a conference in town, as it was very busy with business men from all over Europe. It meant a bit of a wait for a seat, but not too bad at all. The food was very good and service was even better!The location of the hotel was very close to the subway, which is an amazing way to get around. As a foreigner, I found it extremely easy to navigate, as each subway line is assigned a letter, and each stop a number. The language barrier is non existent in that case, as it was simple as getting to ""I-9"" and seeing that we changed to the A line.We had dinner at the Yakitori restaurant one night, and it was extremely entertaining and satisfying. We were so full at one point, we saw the Chef cooking up some fish, and both my wife and I were saying to ourselves ""Don't be for us, don't be for us!!"". Thankfully it wasn't so I didn't have to undo another belt buckle!All in all, a very satisfying experience at The Prince, and if I ever find myself back in Tokyo, I wouldn't hesitate to book there again!",,Sobrien_GM,4,4.0

I booked the hotel because of the high reviews from Trip Advisor, and I felt that some of the reviews probably overrated the hotel. I stayed in the premium room for 7 nights, and felt a little disappointed at the lack of awe factors that I will expect from other luxury hotels.For starters, the room design was a bit outdated, I was expecting more of a modern luxurious feeling from a premium level room; it felt more like an early-2000s-designed superior room on a higher floor level. Sure; there was a daily free bottle of champagne, Ella Baché toiletries, Nepresso coffee, a Jacuzzi tub, exclusive floor access and such, but these are things one will normally get from staying on a premium floor. There was nothing really spectacular from the premium level room. I had a corner room with a view of Tokyo Tower from the bathroom, but sadly the tub was placed in such a way that you can’t enjoy it while facing the tower. Breakfast was included free for the premium level rooms, and there was a choice of three restaurants. A buffet style as well as a continental breakfast set style on the 33rd floor, as well as a Japanese set style breakfast on the basement level. Breakfast was fresh but disappointing when you consider the actual price of the breakfast. For the same price (if you had to pay), a much larger and better spread of choices for breakfast are easily available anywhere else in Tokyo. The portions were very small in the continental and Japanese set breakfast (even for an Asian like me). There is a variety of dishes in the buffet, but after the 4th day at the buffet, the dishes become rather unappealing.What was very disappointing was the premium lounge; it is the worse lounge I have ever seen. No food was served there at all except for a couple of crackers and some fruits in the night. What was surprising was that despite the obvious lack of facilities at the premium lounge, there were still other guests hanging around there during cocktail hour. The attendant at the lounge makes good cocktails though and it was nice to have a drink or two in the evening, unfortunately the lounge closes at 10pm at night.Premium level rooms also have free access to the hot springs below the hotel, a nice place to go after a tiring day in Tokyo. Japanese hot spring etiquette applies here, and a good time to be at the hot springs will be either late in the evening or early morning where there are much lesser people.Overall, the hotel tries hard to be a level above other hotels, but it still fall shorts of being a luxury hotel. Unless there is a promotion going on, you may want to consider other international luxury hotels.","Singapore, Singapore","Ri_Sun8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",26,4.0

Originally we’re looking for hotels in the Shinjuku area with a budget of <=$250 per night, we narrowed it down to Keio Plaza Hotel and Century Southern Tower but after reading Tripadvisor comments we’re a bit discourage with them. We then found Prince Park Tower, the price was within our budget and read many positive reviews, we were a bit hesitant with the location since we wanted to be in a convenient location but we decided to go for it. We booked a Superior Comfort King room from Hotels.com, the price was about $230 per night. We took the Airport Bus Limo service to the hotel (little bit over an hour away) for 3000 yen per person. The hotel check-in was quick and pleasant. The Superior room has its own dedicated and private elevators, which requires room key access. We’re at the 20th floor and the room has a great view of the Tokyo Tower, Zojoji temple, hotel landscape, and Tokyo skyline. The king size bed was huge and comfortable, room also comes with free-wired Internet access, and mini refrigerator with drinks and snack. The bathroom has a great separate shower stall, Jacuzzi tub, and a terrific Toto toilet with features that many bums will enjoy ☺ The only item that was missing was an iron and ironing board however housekeeping will deliver them upon request. We used laundry service twice and got 20% discount each time. The location and nearby Shiba park creates a pleasant peaceful environment especially after spending all day walking through congested streets and subway stations. There are 2 subway stations nearby; Mita and Oedo Line, both are less than 3 minutes walk and they are not congested stations compare to Shinjuku and other main stations. Sample routes - Odeo line to Shinjuku is about 6 stops and Mita line to Ginza is about 3 stops. If you have an iPhone download the Tokyo Underground app ($.99), you just enter to/from subway info and it will tell you what subway lines to take and change to. The Tokyo City Atlas book was also helpful while exploring Tokyo. There isn’t much restaurant nearby the hotel, however the Tokyo Tower (less than 8 minutes walk from the hotel) has shops, convenient store, and fast food restaurant (Japanese and McDonalds). Another option is to take the Oedo line and head over to Roppongi, it’s only 2 stops away (170 yen each way). If you want to try Japanese food but cannot read or speak Japanese, Roppongi Hill (http://www.roppongihills.com/en/) has many restaurants’ menu that includes Japanese and English. The hotel also has several restaurants we tried the Café Novel and Lobby Lounge for late lunch and afternoon tea and the Brise Verte for breakfast. The breakfast was a bit expensive (3000 yen per person) considering we don’t eat much, for the rest of the trip we picked up drinks, bread, and pastry for breakfast from the hotel shop/bakery, they were cheap and delicious. The hotel normal checkout time is 12PM and we’re looking to check out at 2PM for a 6PM flight, we notified the front desk a day prior to our departure and they basically said “No problem”. To our surprise they did not charge us extra even though the hotel policy states ~30% for late check out. The hotel shop has an ATM machine however it only allow withdraw from Japanese bank and Citibank. Unfortunately it did not work with my Wells Fargo debit/Visa card, in fact we’re not able to withdraw money from several Japanese bank ATM machines. Eventually we discovered Shinsei bank and Citibank ATM machines works fine with Wells Fargo and Washington Mutual (Chase). Shinsei bank has some ATM in subway station, we were stopping and changing subway line at Hibiya quite a bit and it has a Shinsei bank ATM machine. Roppongi Hill ATM machine also works fine. Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Prince Park Tower, we didn’t use much of the hotel services and facilities like concierge, business center, and gym/swimming pool. We used the subway all the time and did not rely on taxi, we got familiar with the subway system within the first full day. If you prefer to be near a convenient location with main subway lines, train station, shopping, and restaurants this might not be an ideal hotel for you.","Sunnyvale, CA","dontlosemyluggage</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunnyvale, CA</strong>",55,4.0

The hotel is nearer to Roppongi hills but not by foot. It is two stations away.In short, it is not situated in a major junction like Shibuya, Shinjuku or Roppongi.When, you go outside the hotel, the view is quite depressing because it is not the same bustling atmosphere like Shibuya or Shinjuku.If you want to grab a quick food outside the hotel, well, you have to take the subway or the taxi. The same goes for mundane shopping. I located only one late-night small supermarket on a walkable distance.Yes, there is a park… slightly larger than the ones you find in front of any council building.There is also the Zozoji temple almost at the foot of the hotel.The rooms were very spacious which was a plus point. But the biggest minus point being that it was impossible to make the AC go down below 20°C.The hotel staff came up with three engineers and stayed almost an entire evening to fix it only to say that it should be working automatically…..but the room remained hot.Did not try any of the hotel restaurants for we were mostly visiting. Called for room service which albeit fast and efficient, a bit pricey which of course is not a surprise. The highspeed Internet service was very good in the room. To finish, Tokyo Tower. Well, it is right next to the hotel. That’s it .One of the guide books we tried was Louis Vuitton’s. Very disappointing. For hitech goods, the guide suggests Laox store (like any other guide). To me, Laox store is outdated. I prefer Yodobashi(I am giving the name from memory so my spelling may be not exact), in Shinjuku area or the one situated in Akhibara.For those who crave for Indian food, we tried the south Indian dosais at Dhaba India…one of the best dosais we have ever had and the interior of the restaurant is sober.We also tried the bowling in the basement of the hotel which was quite fun. But, remember, everything (pool, gym) is extra and you have to pay for it.The hotel certainly merits more than the one star I give. But, the one star is because I’ll certainly not come back to this hotel.

As a result, if one is tired after a full day, one is tempted to eat in the hotel rather than take a costly cab ride or walk 20 minutes to a neighborhood where there are some eating places. All the restaurants in the hotel are extremely expensive, although a modest dinner for 2 can be had in the hotel's Chinese restaurant for $70 USD. We had a comfortable, fairly decent-size room with a GREAT bathroom with a jacuzzi tub and a terrific shower. But everything in this hotel is a hassle, at least for non-Japanese. This was the only hotel in Japan (out of 4) where we felt this way.The reception clerk gave us a problem about honoring my membership in their ""club"" for foreigners, the benefits of which include breakfast and access to their Premium Lounge. Incidently, their Premium Lounge is the least ""premium"" of any club lounge that I have ever experienced anywhere in the world. Stale nuts, stale crackers, a plate of fruit and a few cubes of foil-wrapped processed cheese are hardly worth a return visit. To boot, the hostess could not understand any language but Japanese, making the ordering of a drink difficult. Unlike club lounges in other hotels, the Prince Park Tower doesn't trust their guests to pour their own drinks, not even non-alcoholic drinks.The concierge answered questions but never made a suggestion, like they did in other Japanese hotels we stayed at -- as a result, I had a lot more research to do than I should have. The air conditioning was broken and was never fixed. Getting turn-down service at night was a hassle. Using the business center computer was a hassle.Unless you get a real deal, with breakfast included, go elsewhere.","Sarasota, FL USA","Cando</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sarasota, FL USA</strong>",67,4.0

In consensus with many of the other reviewers it is a 'very good' hotel. However, I don't think I can go as far to say it is 'great'!The staff were very helpful and courteous (as you come to expect in Japan). The room it self I felt was fairly generic - similar in quality and size to many hotels I've stayed in across Asia.The location is not a strong point. Apart from the Tokyo Tower there is not much nearby, and I didn't come across many restaurants etc. close to the hotel. However, for me, this wasn't a big deal as there were two subway stations within a 5-10 minute walk.The one thing that I felt let the hotel down is the lobby area. I thought it poor compared to other hotels I've stayed in of a comparable class. It's fairly small and there aren't enough chairs etc.","Long Itchington, United Kingdom","christopherhT5458EW</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Itchington, United Kingdom</strong>",17,4.0

The staff was so friendly and accommodating. We used the concierge quite a bit to find things around Tokyo, and they were always very helpful.The rooms were nice. They weren't overly roomy, but big enough, especially by Tokyo standards. The bathroom was definitely the highlight of the room. It was very modern with a huge jacuzzi tub. We got a great deal at the hotel by signing up for their loyalty club. It was free to sign up, and included free breakfast and a lounge with cocktails, tea, etc. The breakfast options were great, too. We only ate at the breakfast buffet during our stay, but there were also two more formal options included in the club membership.The location of the Prince Park Tower is good, although it isn't close to many restaurants or bars. It's within (long) walking distance from the JR train station, but there is also a shuttle that will take you there. A short taxi ride can get you to Roppongi, if you want to go out for dinner or check out some Japanese nightlife. There are several restaurants and bars in the hotel, too.

What a pleasure it was! We got the airport limousine from Narita to the Hotel. We had to wait an hour for the bus at the airport and the trip to the hotel was just short of 2 hours. It cost 3000 Yen each way and 4 hours after landing we eventually got to this great hotel!The service at this hotel is absolutely incredible .... the best we've ever had and we travel a lot. Only down point was that we arrived to a room that smelt of smoke and had 2 single beds even though we'd requested a king bed as it was our honeymoon. Within seconds we were moved to the 27th floor to a nice smelling room with a king bed.The room was huge (the biggest in our 6 weeks round the world travels) and spotless. The views out of Tokyo tower were also quite impressive. As previously mentioned there is every ammenity under the sun (hair brushes, hair bands, combs, razors, toothbrushes etc etc etc). The bath is great (big and deep) and the water automatically stops running when it is full. It also functions as a spa bath with jets. We didn't have breakfast included and had to pay 3000Y each which I thought was a bit steep (50AUD per person!) but Tokyo is not a cheap place. The food was pretty good and buffet choice adequate. There are not many places around the hotel to go for breakfast so I'd suggest getting this included if you can get a good rate. The breakfast lounge is on the 33rd floor so you do get great views.We didn't have a problem with the hotel's location contrary to other reviews. We only had 3 days in tokyo but managed to get around and see everything we wanted to. The closest station is Akabanebashi on the Oedo line. I timed our walk there from the hotel lobby and it was 5 minutes exactly (1 minute of which was spent waiting at the big intersection for the lights to turn green). It took us 20 minutes to walk to Roppongi Hills from the hotel ... easy walk just turn right outside hotel and keep walking until you get to Roppongi! IThere are over 50 different places to eat at Roppongi althought it was very quiet the evening we went up there. If it's raining the hotel will lend you umbrellas.The other plus was free wifi which we really appreciated after having to pay 75US centre per minute previously!I'd highly recommend this hotel based on its big rooms, excellent service and what we thought was a pretty neat location away from the hustle and bustle.","Stirling, Australia","Dee28</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stirling, Australia</strong>",38,5.0

The rooms - mine had a spectacular view of the Tokyo Tower - are an ample size, larger than usual for a Japanese hotel and I found the price - similar to the ANA, which offers a better location but is a much less attractive hotel - very competitive.

The rooms are kept spotless and housekeeping kindly provided many extra coffee capsules for the Nepresso machine at my daily request.During our first stay, we were able to get the Tokyo Tower view which is awesome. There was also a nice note with a box of cookies from the property for the occasion which was sweet. Also, we went bowling a few times (the ""salon"" is by the spa/gym) and because we were on our honeymoon, we got two games plus shoes comped. I think the policy is that if you don't use the spa/gym, you can trade in that pass for one game. The bowling alley is really well-kept! I also used the hot springs and it's so soothing after all the walking we were doing. Concierge was great. The location was about a 10-minute walk to various subway lines and JR station. I do wish it had more convenient local restaurants around the property but I guess it's a trade-off because it was very peaceful and quiet by Shiba Park.

They were friendly and genuine in their desire to make our stay pleasant. Their English was quite good and we never had any communication issues. Our one complaint was with the air conditioning. It didn't seem to have the capacity to cool the room properly and the room was always a bit warm, perhaps 77F. It was under 70F outside which makes this a bit disappointing.","San Jose, CA","skg_8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, CA</strong>",7,5.0

Even though not all staff spoke english , everyone had a basic understanding of the language . We took the airport bus (3,000 yen each) and dropped us off right in front of the hotel . we arrived late at night however staff was there to take luggage and showed us to our room. The glass elevator took us to our executive room which was on the 19th floor , we had a balcony and a beautiful view of Tokyo Tower ! My other son who lives in japan came to visit us . we asked if he could stay the night and this was no trouble , room was spacious enough to fit an extra bed, not only did they bring in a rollaway bed but all the toiletries as well ! Room was extremely clean, bathroom was fantastic, shower had four different nozzle adjustments including massage ! Jacuzzi tub was relaxing to soak in after a day of shopping . Toilet even had a warm seat ! Location wise - close to two subway lines (about 2 minutes walking distance) and hotel also provides free shuttle to Hamamatsucho station which connects to the JR line. We always carried our subway map and although looks daunting at first, was quite easy to work out & very efficient . Tokyo transport system leaves sydney for dead ! There is a television , however, only CNN & BBC in english . There was also free fast wireless internet in our room which was very handy as we did not have our mobile phones.. Sadly , there are no restaurants in close proximity however we enjoyed our meal at cafe novel (basement level) . There is also a spa & fitness centre but my son could not use this facility as it is only for people over 25 years of age (which was disappointing). The hotel shop has a bakery and sells yummy pastries & bread. We went to asakusa for souvenirs & shopping. We went to Ginza where we saw hundreds of people queuing to enter the new HM building - quite amazing !!! On our last night we had cocktails at the Sky Lounge on the 33rd floor - outstanding view ! Having my PCI card meant we were able to check out later in afternoon. We had buffet breakfast on the last morning - great assortment of food !

The hotel is really nice and cool. I was there in the heat of July and it was always so nice to come back to the hotel and have it be so cool.There's a little store just as you enter the hotel that has pastries and snacks and sodas and beer. Rather than eat the hotel breakfast, I would just grab a pastry or yogurt from here.Free wireless Internet.The gym is really good. I would echo other comments here...wear your own clothes down to the gym with street shoes...but bring your running shoes with you. Then you can change into their gym outfits once you're in the locker room. I actually ended up bringing my own gym shorts, but using their t-shirts. (Which are quite nice--the kind that wick moisture away.) You do have to pay for the gym. I was very impressed with all the amenities in the locker room and was sad I did make more of an event of using the facilities...pool, sauna, etc.My room was fantastic. It was an executive room. The bath was a whirlpool bath and really deep. I normally am a bit skeeved out by hotel baths, but this was one of the cleanest I have ever seen, so I did use it after a long day. It was great.You're close to two metro stations, which is really convenient. Perhaps my only complaint is that there weren't any restaurants right on the hotel's doorstep. You had to walk a bit to get to any.All in all, this is a super high class hotel.

We stayed here for 6 nights after staying at the Hyatt Regency in Shinjuku. Although I feel that staff are slightly more friendly at the Hyatt, the room and facilities at the Prince Park Tower were certainly better. As we had a premium room, we had special executive elevators to get to the floor, which included the previously mentioned glass elevators. This is quite an experience as you shoot up the 31-floor atrium in a glass lift! The room was very well equipped with flat screen TV, free internet and far more exciting, remote control curtains! Well it's the little things that count!The bathroom was great with a separate large shower and jacuzzi bath, and the bed was the most comfortable I have slept in in Japan.For the extra money we paid for the premium room, we really reaped the rewards. We had free breakfast each morning in the Sky Buffet on the 33rd floor (otherwise charged at around £12.50 per person) and free entry to the beautiful and well equipped leisure club, pool, jacuzzi and hot spring baths. Again, this would otherwise have cost around £15 per person, so well worth it, especially in the middle of August! We had entry into the small but pleasant premium lounge, where we could order cocktails free of charge every evening between 5 and 10pm, and even better, our mini-bar was re-stocked every day with a complimentary half bottle of champagne. Sitting in the jacuzzi tub overlooking the lights of the city whilst sipping my free champagne was a highlight of this holiday. I should also mention that the restaurants on the lower ground floor of the hotel seemed very good, and price-wise appeared much more reasonable than at other hotels. And whilst its tempting to head off to Ginza or Roppongi every night, the area around the hotel is also pleasant for an informal evening. If you head out of the back of the hotel (follow the signs for leisure club, or banqueting entrance), you emerge by the Zozoji shrine. Follow the main street down towards Hamamatsucho station, and along this street are a number of pleasant pubs, bars and Japanese Yakitori places and Izaka-ya. We found a great Japanese place on the 5th floor above a British style pub. A couple of beers each and a meal of sashimi, yakitori, roast meats etc would set us back around £20 in total! Combine that with the free drinks in the premium lounge & you have a very cheap night out.

If you are staying here, do ask for a view overlooking the Temple or Tower...the best views are to be had from the North or North-West aspects; the hotel overlooks Shibuya Park, which is simply wonderful and (if you like Tokyo Tower) offers a spectacular view both of it and other landmark buildings such as the Mori Tower at Roppongi Hills (which you simply must visit).From a public transport point-of-view, you are very well-placed for Akabanebashi (Odeo Line) and Daimon (Odeo and Asakusa Lines). However, as fun as the Metro is, you can be in Shinjuku in 20 mins in a cab or Tokyo Station district in about 20-30 depending on the time of day. Cabs aren't that expensive (caveat here being that I live in London, so I'm used to very pricey cabs); a fare from the Prince to Roppongi was always on or about 1000 Yen, which is five pounds sterling or 10 USD at time of writing. So, for the sake of getting an air-conditioned taxi, save yourself the hassle of getting on a Metro train if you need to arrive at your destination dressed well. Don't even bother with the Metro at peak time. Just don't. Unless you really like being VERY intimate with your fellow man. As for the hotel itself, the room was spotless, truly. The service at the front desk was very good and housekeeping responsive if you need to ask for an iron/power adaptor etc. I would say, however, that the vast majority of hotels in Tokyo have the same level of service regardless of class. If it's one thing Japanese hotels do well, it's hospitality. If you are a vegetarian, you will need to eat elsewhere other than the hotel in the evening, which - if, like me, you've just got off a 12 hour flight from London and a one-hour drive from the airport, is a little tedious. However, I don't actually see that, even if I weren't a veggie, that I would eat in the hotel. The food menu looked very good, but very pricey indeed. As mentioned above, I would be inclined to take the five min cab-ride to Roppongi Hill instead, which has many restaurants and bars to suit all tastes in one of the most progressive and modern parts of the city. However, the bar at the top of the hotel is well worth a visit at night, since the view and service is exceptional.Breakfast in the Hotel is a good variety of Western and Japanese cuisine. You will not leave feeling like you have paid over the odds for a poor choice of breakfast, as has been a common experience for me. Breakfast cereals, breads, lots of fruit and juices, pancakes...the choice is very good. Hotel breakfasts are never ""value for money"", since the mark-up is huge, but the choice and variety is very good indeed.This has been mentioned elsewhere, but a word of warning about the gym and spa. You will not be allowed to use this if you are under 25 years of age. This is a problem for some with families and seems a little harsh to me. I would rather see the hotel having its facilities open to all between certain times and 18+ years from, say, 1900. This, for me, emphasised the ""business hotel"" positioning that the hotel is gunning for.In summary - I would not hesitate in recommending the hotel to anyone staying in Tokyo. It is well-placed, with a good team of staff who will look after you almost to the point of it being a little embarrassing.Do learn a little Japanese before you go. ""Please"" and ""thank you"" will elicit a warm response from the locals and is a basic courtesy!Finally...and I know this sounds daft....but for a hotel that has over 500 rooms, I never felt like I was staying in a ""large"" hotel. The layout is designed very well as such you will not feel like you bumping into people every five mins.One downside - two of the internal lifts made of glass that run from the ground to the 33rd floor overlooking the atrium. Very cool if you like that sort of thing. Not so nice if you have vertigo, like the poor Spanish lady I met on my first day!",London,"The_Truffles</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",96,4.0

They even brought an extra set of toiletries, towels, and china for the tea. The room was fairly spacious especially compared to the other hotels we stayed in on our trip. The balcony was great, and the room was impeccably stocked. There is even a jetted tub and washlet (Japanese electro-bidet, haha).

But I checked Trip Advisor two days before we left and found poor reviews for Tokyo Prince - 187th out of 256, I think - so I became desperate and quickly looked for alternatives in the same area. Turned out there was a Prince Park Tower Tokyo, also owned by the Prince chain, and just across the street from Tokyo Prince. It was new - built in 2005 - which is probably why the school wasn't too familiar with it. It was rated a high 11th in Trip Advisor. The rates were almost similar. So we immediately asked the school to rebook us, and luckily, they were able to. It's one of the last stops on the Airport Limo Bus service but that was a bit of blessing since it allowed us to see a number of hotels in the area, esp Tokyo Prince which looked quite old from the outside. The limo bus had to park 150 meters from the front door which was a minor inconvenience but the bell people were very quick to meet the bus and unload our luggage. Every one who got in was met individually by a front desk person and led to a separate stall with guest chairs. What a nice touch, rather than having you line up and stand while checking in. Maybe it was just us but they didn't take our credit card - ""we'll just need that at the end"", they said. We were booked on the executive floors - from 18th to 26th, I think - since they were the only ones available with just 20 hours before check-in. For that, we paid a bit more than standard - appr $250 per weekend night and $225 for weekday night. But for that, we got a very high floor - 24th - with a fantastic Tokyo skyline view (floor to ceiling glass window), including a very peaceful vantage of the Zojoji Temple adjoining the property and the Tokyo Tower nearby. The view alone was worth the price. And the hotel room had a balcony which was great for occasionally going out at night to just check in the city lights and cool air. Part of the package was the autumn meal plan, which was a bit beyond the usual free breakfast. What it did was allow us to take breakfast at any of five outlets, or alternatively, take lunch in the coffee shop, or use the coupons for gym - very new equipment and free trainers, or for bowling - yes, they had a great 8-lane alley in basement 2! So if you felt you had already overeaten or had a lunch outside, you could use it to bowl or work out. That system was so flexible. The hotel itself is so impressive. the bank of elevators dedicated to the executive rooms - 4 of them - were so classy - lighted glass, dark wood, steel, chrome, with glass-and-wood doors. And the whole elevator foyer was similarly stunning. They had their own bakery cum convenience store cum gift shop. They also had a Hallmark type store plus drug store. My wife was looking for vitamin C tablets and I needed some back pain relief and we both found what we were looking for. The hotel also had several specialty designer (foreign brands) shops in a sort of short ""high street"". The coffee shop in the basement was well-designed, with a skylight that showered natural light on a basement location. The sky lounge on the 33rd was similarly impressive because of the wall-to-ceiling glass that provided unobstructed views. But what was unique - although this didn't apply to our situation - was that the hotel seemed to be geared for weddings and honeymoons. Half of a basement floor was dedicated to wedding banquet halls. They had shops for bridal gowns, wedding-honeymoon photos, wedding planners, pre-wedding grooming, flowers, a Wako Dept Store wedding gifts section, etc. There was even an outdoor chapel just above the wedding halls and an escalator from there to the wedding basement. Unbelievable!On our floor itself, the carpets, lighting, and room doors were all very tastefully done and designed. The rooms were decently sized - I believe about 40 sq meters or just a bit less. The bathrooms were large, with jacuzzi (my wife loved it!) and stalled shower. The toilet seat was usual ""smart"" Japanese - with heating, deodorizer, flush volume control, etc. They were way over the top with amenities, including giving my wife an obviously-expensive Shisheido pack (of course, they only did that once for the entire stay. As you would expect, there were a lot of lighting controls bedside. There was white reading light on the end of a flexible neck that you would only find in the business class of a plane. Curtains were by push button. But the aircon controls didn't seem to respond too well, when we wanted to lower the temperature from the auto 24-25 degrees to something cooler. We weren't sure if that was the design or there was a flaw. The pillows were too thick and a bit on the hard side. But you could ask for a replacement - my wife changed hers for one of those molded ortho ones, free of charge. I had a problem with the two lounge chairs in the room - they were obviously leather and expensive but they weren't too ergonomic. We also had a minor issue with the room safe. Unlike other safes, you had to key in the number every time you locked. So there was a danger that you weren't paying too great an attention when you closed up again and you might have punched in a wrong number. Which was what happened to us on the 4th day. But housekeeping was very quick to respond and reset the safe - they were in the room a minute after we called. Wired internet access was free - nice. But no wireless. But - they were thoughtful enough to provide an ethernet cable! What thoughtfulness. And the best touch - a flat panel Sony LCD TV! It looked like a 42 incher. But - the satellite channels only gave you CNN Japan, BBC, and Fox - and half of its programs were in Japanese. There was also a sports program which had the occasional MLB and Euro football if it wasn't doing the Japanese baseball. You could also do HD TV but they were all Japanese programs.The concierge were very helpful - and spoke good English - but the Hata tours and the Grey line tours were often fully booked. My sense was they had very limited capacity - so make sure you book your tours way in advance. The hotel itself is in the Shiba Park, which is probably green in spring and summer but it was turning brown in late September. Still, the park is a nice place to spend a hour or so since they have many park benches and they have short hill climbs. The Shojoji temple is just nearby and very conveniently gives you a feel for the Buddhist architecture and influence. You don't really have to go to the far-off Asakusa Sendoji temple which is in the itinerary of all the tours. In the same block as the hotel is the the Shiba-koen subway station. I's one of the few stations that gives away an English version of the subway system map - make sure you get one. The downside is that it doesn't overlap with any other line so chances are, unless you're going to the Imperial Palace, you'll need to make transfers. When you're booking a hotel, make sure your hotel is on the list of the airport bus and the tour buses for pick-up and drop-off - fortunately, Prince Park Tower is on those lists. For those who are scared of learning the subway system, the hotel is sort of close enough that you can walk - long though, on average 30-40 minutes brisk walk - to the pier area (for a river cruise or to see the Hama Detached Garden), to the Imperial Palace area, to Roppongi, and to Ginza. All in all, I was very impressed with the Prince Park Tower - especially at the price point - and will certainly have no second thoughts about booking there again if I needed to be in that general South Central Tokyo area.","Manila, Philippines","JGR001</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",237,5.0

I was very impressed by this property and would wholeheartedly recommend it.The location has pluses and minuses - the hotel is in the middle of a very pretty park, so it is not particularly close to anything, but it is a healthy (15-20 minute) walk to Ginza or Roppongi, and a $10-12 cab ride. It is on the airport ""limousine"" bus route but is the next-to-last stop, so the ride takes approx. 1 hour. It is very close to the Oedo and Asakusa subway lines, so if you can navigate the subways, it is incredibly convenient. Because it is the highest building in the immediate area, the views are incredible, and it feels very quiet and restful.I got a fabulous rate online with one of the expedia/travelocity type sites but still joined the Prince Club - didn't get breakfast included in the rate, but they did give me a nicer room than I had reserved - ended up north-facing, on the 14th floor with a small balcony and a spectacular view of Tokyo Tower and the Zozoji temple.The hotel and the room were quite impressive - the hotel is still fairly new and is in pristine shape. The room was much larger than I had expected it to be - a very good-sized room by NY standards - and well furnished, with a comfortable bed and nice linens. The bathroom was done in grey marble and had a separate shower enclosure and whirlpool tub. The toiletries even included bathsalts for the tub!The bar upstairs had a spectacular view - the drink wasn't very good and was ridiculously overpriced (~$25, with table charge) - but was still worth it for the view. The sushi restaurant downstairs was not cheap, but it was quite good. The main gift shop downstairs had very reasonably priced pastries and small bites, and made for a wonderful snack/breakfast stop.The service at the hotel was truly superb - the check-in and out was quick and easy, and the money exchange desk staff were very good. The concierge was superb - she came up with excellent recommendations for trendy yakitori in Roppongi and wonderful Kaiseki in Ginza, and printed out maps of each restaurant to give to cab drivers or to navigate myself. The bell staff was extremely good at giving maps and directions to cab drivers.Bottom line - I would have been very satisfied if I had paid $350/night to stay here. At less than $200 a night (or even $250 a night), it is an extraordinary bargain, and I couldn't have been any happier.",new york,"awdub</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>new york</strong>",127,5.0

We had a great room on the 15th floor with fabulous views of the Tokyo Tower and the surrounding city. Our room was well appointed, immaculately maintained, and extremely comfortable. As members of the Prince Club, we enjoyed the tasty complimentary breakfasts served at the Brise Verte Restaurant and at the bountiful buffet restaurant. Both of these restaurants are located on the 33rd floor and offer spectacular views. We relaxed and enjoyed the evening skylight views and the complimentary evening cocktails and appetizers served at the Club Lounge on the 27th floor.  The customer service offered by all levels of the the hotel staff was excellent. They were extremely attentive and went out of their way to assist us. The Tokyo Tower and the Zooiji Temple are within a few minutes walk from the hotel.. A complimentary shuttle to and from the Hamamatsucho Station is available for all guests..  We would definitely stay at this hotel again when we return to Tokyo and heartily recommend it to others who are planning a visit .",Los Angeles,"twofortravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",33,5.0

Joined the Prince Club International to get special discount rate and free buffet breakfast for two. Wife and her family members thought the hotel was fantastic as well. Had the Superior Twin room (365 sq feet) with huge marble bathtub. Quite large room. Very tranquil surrounding as located within park (Tokyo Tower is located in the park) but very close to Roppongi. Taking a cab to Roppongi was very easy and also 5 minute walk to subway station. Hotel is basically brand new and loved the design. Room was about US$250 per night with breakfast buffet for two. And you can eat the buffet on top floor of building with nice views of Tokyo. Will stay at this hotel again.,Seoul,"megatron2007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seoul</strong>",6,5.0

The aquarium is great value for money, the cinema shows English films, the bowling was fun.Everything about the hotel is great. I heard that the breakfast was expensive, but i did not have this myself, so cant comment on this.Railway line just outside the hotel is very handy.","Blandford, Dorset","loftmeister</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Blandford, Dorset</strong>",28,5.0

About 5 min. from the nearest subway system, which by the way is the most efficient and CLEAN. The hotel provides a shuttle to the JR train station on the hour. The hotel was built in '05.

Wow, it is superb - better than all the above.Nice 'sit down' check-in, higher security than I've seen in most hotels eg, my swipe card limits me to my floor alone, plus public floors. It takes me through three separate electronically controlled doors between the lobby and my bed!The room is lovely. Good size for Tokyo, with nice touches such as plasma tv, electric curtains, robe I can almost walk into (plenty of space to store my big suitcase inside). The black marble bathroom includes a separate big shower (I really don't like shower over baths) as well as bath. Huge array of Ella Bache lotions etc.Like most Japanese hotel chains, Prince Hotels offer 'club lounges' to guests. Always free, it is just necessary to sign up, just once for each chain. Access is available irrespective of room rate etc, unlike the American chains that provide club lounges if you pay a premium rate, on the 'executive floor'. Minutes ago I finished breakfast at a very nice lounge. Fabulous view from the 27th floor, with juice / cereal / toasts / bakery / fruits etc provided. No hot food as is the norm in these lounges. And only 3 other guests.... I had earlier walked past the queue of guests waiting for a table at a main restaurant, where it costs big bucks for breakfast - and I'm a light eater. The Prince also include free evening cocktails. And in the case of this visit, the Prince upgraded me to what is one of the nicest king sized rooms I've ever had anywhere. It is on a special meeting conference rate, but is still amazing value for 23,000 yen per night, tax and internet included, when the free club lounge then provides the evening drinks and breakfast too.","Melbourne, Australia","Cowombat2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",76,5.0

The hotel lobby and indeed the very fancy bathrooms are solid marble.The ""open to the roof "" lobby with its glass elevator is spectacular, as is the view to the floor below with its pond and all the restaurants(14 of them). The rooms are large even by American standards, and some even look out at the Tokyo Tower. The bar at the top of the hotel is classy and elegant. As far as the bathrooms go, the toilet has its own little room opposite the bathroom, which has a separate shower and tub. Included amenities are lovely. Every up to date electrical trick is in this hotel, lights that automatically brighten at the approach of a guest, lighting controls for the room next to the bed, etc. Beds are fairly hard, but the down pillows and duvets are great. A word of caution: Book a package that includes the $35 breakfast, which is excellent.Do not confuse this hotel with the Prince Park Hotel. It's shabby next to this brand new hotel.",,mrsmoo1950,57,5.0

From the reception area to the room itself, the place was immaculate, beautiful and very well run. I was upgraded on arrival to an Executive room (2103) for about $268(USD)/nite, which has a panoramic view of the Tokyo Tower and the large park spreading below that is breathtaking, day or night. Bed was excellent, bathroom large with whirlpool tub. Mirror was heated on one side so no matter how steamy you could use it. The only faults I found were that the bathroom should have an exhaust fan and speaker for the TV/radio. This hotel is fortunate in having wide open space around it that many (prestigious) hotels do not. Service was impeccable and there is a plethora of dining choices, even a small Mini-mart off the Lobby that has a bakery, selling wine, beer, munchies, sundries and gifts. Buy your cold coffee in cans there, because few places in Japan serve a decent cup. Quite handy. But see if you can get a deal that includes breakfast, because at $37(USD), its a bit steep if you're one of the granola & fruit herd.Given what I saw of other hotels arguably closer to the action, the tradeoff is to the Tower's advantage. Walk to the Tokyo Tower, go by the Temples in your next door park or hop the subway/grab a cab. This will be my Tokyo Headquarters.","Chicago, Illinois","Secretagent19</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",28,5.0

However, inside is a different story. You are met with a view up the inside of the hollow tower from the bottom to the top (30 floors I think), which is amazing. I definitely recommend going to the sky bar at the top for a drink at night as it overlooks the TV tower which is lit up at night. We were staying in an executive room on the 26th floor which had the most amazing views over Tokyo, especially at night. The room itself was large with the usual amenities you would expect. The bathroom was the real treat - with a heated toilet seat, marble sink and jacuzzi bath. The only down side is that the immediate vicinity of the hotel is not very central. However, there are two metro stations within a few minutes walks and these will take you anywhere in the city. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.","East Kilbride, United Kingdom","H_Taylor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>East Kilbride, United Kingdom</strong>",50,5.0
