As a Globalist, we were supposed to receive a complimentary upgrade to a standard suite, which was available during our online checkin. Despite a 1 King Suite being available, we were assigned a 1 King Premium. When we mentioned this at checkin the hotel said they had no suites available to place us in and we could pay for an upgrade to the Penthouse suite. We paid for the upgrade but this is not how it should work per the World of Hyatt terms and conditions.Rooms are tastefully decorated and functional and have a great selection of snacks and drinks inside. Very spacious but that is what I would expect for their top room. Our breakfast was also covered and the restaurant staff were very friendly and the food was delicious.Our stay was very short but it was a great one. Gild Hall offers a good value for cash and points stay. I would recommend booking as late as possible because the hotel dropped their rates for that night sometime in the afternoon.","Chicago, Illinois","jmcelvenny</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",0,5.0

Rooms were probably the biggest we’ve had in NYC without spending up for a non-standard guest room. Everything was simply but elegantly styled with dark colors and touches of leather and brass here and there; great retro-modern vibe. Felt very much like a boutique hotel, which we always appreciate over a cookie-cutter upscale chain option. Staff was very friendly, and Moisey and Paolo in particular were great. Helped us find a late-night drink at check-in even though their bar had just closed (11:00 on a Thursday felt a tad early to us, but then we appreciated the quieter lobby on subsequent nights). We didn’t visit their attached restaurant and bar during our stay since we were always headed out to visit friends in other neighborhoods, but it looked nice and we are a little bummed we never slowed down enough to grab a drink at the small but enticing bar. We look forward to returning in the near future and enjoying more of their amenities, like the cute cruiser bikes available for check-out (in a few weeks, they’d be perfect to take to Battery Park and/or go on a longer ride to Riverside Park).

Gild Hall is a boutique hotel located in the Financial District. Even before we arrived, we were greeted with a nice text message from the hotel saying how excited they were for our arrival and wanting to know if there was anything we needed to prepare for our visit. We travel with our dogs (who are fashion models and model in NYFW) and it is always a pleasure to stay at a hotel that embraces our canine pals. A BIG bonus is that they do not charge a pet fee. One of my pet peeves when traveling with dogs is that the hotels tend to give you a ‘worn-out’ room, not at Gild Hall!! Our room was pristine! Beautiful all the way around including a gorgeous high ceiling. Staying at the Gild Hall was so amazing. Everyone knew our name and our dog’s names. We were welcomed by Robert with Prosecco upon check-in and complementary Prosecco every afternoon. After we settled into our room on our first evening, we got a knock at our room door. When I opened the door, we were presented with a lovely fresh fruit bowl, artisan water, glasses, 2 water bowls for the dogs, and the most beautiful card from the hotel staff with an illustration of our dogs done by Caitlyn in the front office. Another shout out to Caitlyn is how she went above and beyond by recommending a car service for us from the airport. Let’s just say these folks went out of there way to make our stay so welcoming and we will be returning on our next stay!!!! Love you all!!!

It's a very short walk to Wall St. and the subway and there are plenty of food and shopping options nearby.

It felt so cozy and warm while keeping a classy vibe. The front desk staff--Simon, Caitlin, and Anthony--were extremely helpful in answering my questions and accommodating me and my dog into our hotel room. The hotel dog (?) was an adorable golden retriever called Maya, who is in the photo I've posted. She definitely added to the whole hospitality experience. The lobby itself was beautiful, with leather couches and candles on the tables with an antler chandelier that hung from the ceiling. I settled myself into my room that had a king-sized bed. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the staff had provided two bowls for my dog for food and water. There was a full length mirror right by the door so that I could get one last check of my outfit before I stepped back out. The mini-bar was fully stocked but I had already made a reservation for the restaurant downstairs, Felice. The bed was huge and the pillows were nice and plump, with crisp, clean sheets (as expected). Mina, the restaurant manager of the night, was so inviting and made me feel as if I were truly a guest at her own home. I sat at the bar for my dinner and the bartender (sadly I forgot her name) made some delicious drinks for me. Even though she was hellishly busy as it was NYE, she spent time to speak to me and find out my likes/dislikes to make sure that she makes a drink that would fit my palate. Later on in the night, I wanted another towel to use and Simon was so pleasant and polite over the phone, regardless of the fact that it was around 3AM. He made me feel like my small towel request was such an important one. Amber was also courteous during our interactions. Overall, I'd definitely recommend a stay here.

However, I didn’t feel that their response was sincere and acceptable, especially as a Hyatt Explorist status. The very least they could have down was return my point redemption I used for this as it was a waste. Instead I received an insincere email offering a discount next time I want to chance staying there again.My stay here was marred by a series of small incidents that ultimately led to a very disappointing and uncomfortable stay.First, while taking a shower, the water repeatedly stopped flowing every minute or so, leaving you standing there with no water for several seconds at a time before spitting back out. Also, there were dirty room service plates and trays littering the hallway which was very much a turn off. I understand that it may take time to clear these away. However, they were all present when we checked in and still there the next day when we checked out. There was a pile of dirty plates and utensils right in front of 188 as soon as we exited the elevator and more l scattered near the electrical room door directly across from our room. Being this is a NYC property, space is a premium and several times I had to cautiously navigate my suitcase around these as not to make an even bigger mess. Next, I realize that Gild Hall can not control the behavior of other guests but our room was next to the Penthouse which was occupied by a family whose children were repeatedly screaming, fighting and running around. What Gild Hall can control is the insulation and soundproofing of their rooms. We were woken up repeatedly by the shriek of screaming children and fighting. On top of that, Gild Hall has the most uncomfortable pillows I have ever experienced, they are very flat with no head support. In addition, we found the air conditioning system inadequate. I realize that the system must be turned to heat only for the Winter months. However, it left the rooms stuffy and too warm with little opportunity for relief from the stifling heat.","San Francisco, California","Ronnasana</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",12,2.0

First it wouldn't drain, then they fixed it, and then it wouldn't plug at all. And it was still wonky and didn't work properly after two visits from repair people. Also -- two adults, one almost thread-bare bath towel each. I had to ask twice for a couple more towels. The second time they just never showed up. If you're a four-star hotel, the towels should be of higher quality, and there should be two per person. People often have two showers /baths a day if they've been running around doing touristy things all day.The water bottles in your room are not complimentary, and that's not clear -- so understand you'll be billed more than 10 bucks a bottle if you drink it.

The location is in the Financial area in lower Manhattan. This can be good or bad. It is very close to the subway and to TKTS downtown, however, it can be not as convenient location if one intention if more in the Broadway theater area.PROs:The hotel itself is beautiful despite the grabby location in which it is situated. Once you enter the building the design is modern and beautiful, which continues into the rooms.The staff is one of the best and personable ever. They seem to really like what they are doing, which says a lot about the hotel management. All of our interactions with the staff were above and beyond, and when they learned about the special occasion we had they responded with sending a gift to the room. It is the only Hyatt hotel that can be booked using a free night certificate in Manhattan. Hyatt status was recognized (although being an entry level, it was not much)CONs:The rooms are small, despite getting an upgrade the room was quite small (though probably not too small in NYC terms). I cannot even imagine how small the basic room is.There is a glass door between the bathroom and the room which means that you probably wake up your partner if you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night.All in all, it was a pleasant stay.

I had just gotten in from a red eye flight and really wanted to freshen up and change if it was an option. Despite my multiple check-ins with multiple front desk employees and physically waiting in the lobby for 5+ hours while being told a room might be ready soon, I ended up finally being pinged for a room 30 minutes from guaranteed check-in with everyone else and waiting in line to get a room. I know early check-in is not guaranteed, but just TELL ME YOU AREN'T GOING TO DO IT! Don't keep saying maybe in an hour while I stay either inside the hotel or nearby, screwing up my whole day. Because it wasn't until very late that it was ready and they suddenly had plenty of rooms for everyone, it was obvious that the staff saying they would let me know as soon as a room was ready was not the case and they had in fact made no effort to get me in early even after seeing me clearly waiting within the line of sight of the front desk based on this information.Then, after confirming with the front desk that the bottle of water in the room was free to me as a loyalty member, they charged me $9 for one bottle and sent nothing to my email so I only caught the false charge on my credit card bill. Honestly, this was not a big deal at all compared to losing half a day at check-in, but still annoying that I was charged after getting explicit verbal confirmation that I would not be charged.All in all, the staff seemed super uncoordinated and either dishonest or non-communicative to let these errors occur. I can never get that half day of my vacation back, but hopefully this review will help you consider any number of great other hotels you have to choose from in NYC.As for the physical hotel and location, it is convenient to FiDi and WTC and well decorated inside, but note that every room basically just looks right into the apartment complex across the very narrow street.","Los Angeles, California","pointyboi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",8,1.0

We have had to do similiar when booking Hyatt award nights in the past, and this was handled seamlessly at an overseas location. Also the prosecco mentioned in other reviews was not offered to us at check-in, but perhaps this is because we arrived late in the evening from our flight.The next day we had to return to the desk as our keys had only been coded for one night would not work. The second night we had to return to the desk as again our keys were not working. After having been out and about traveling all day we were very tired, and had to wait for 3 separate guests to be checked in before we could even alert the front desk that we had a problem. Then we found out our keys had been purposely deactivated because they thought we were supposed to check out that day and had just squatted in the room. If this were the case I think a phone call would have been appropriate instead of just locking us out. Then of course when we got our keys fixed and returned to the room it had not been cleaned at all. Very frustrating.The location of the property is very convenient and quiet at night, and the rooms are lovely- but based on our experience I'm not sure we would go back.","Charlottesville, Virginia, United States","MNAFwanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charlottesville, Virginia, United States</strong>",5,2.0

Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by the sympathetic and understanding front desk staff, led by Angel and his manager Van Halen.

The room was extremely spacious by Manhattan standards, and when I returned to the downstairs lobby to finalize meeting deliverables for the next morning, I found the lounge in the lobby comfortable and welcoming as I wrapped up the last of my work.

The hotel is located in the financial district, so the neighborhood is a little quieter than other parts of the city. It is an easy walk to the South Street Seaport. You are close to the Seaport, but not too close and that's a good thing. Finding the hotel could be a challenge, as the streets in the financial district are narrow and turns are everywhere. It's not the most taxi-friendly area, so be prepared to walk. The hotel itself is very clean, modern and stylishly decorated. The lobby ambiance is inviting and great, but on the tiny side so it can get packed easily. The rooms themselves are a little on the small side, but comfortable and fairly quiet.

We arrived very early and we were surprisingly greeted warmly and were told they had a room ready for us. They also gave us an upgrade to a slightly larger room (without asking). Room was nice, no view but everything was in working order. The water pressure was tremendous! Noticed a hair in the sink when we first arrived. No big deal as the bathroom was obviously cleaned, it happens, I quickly rinsed it before my wife noticed. :-)The mattress was VERY comfortable unlike most Hyatt properties. Oddly there was no top sheet, not sure if this was a miss or cost cutting. As part of the $19.95 destination fee automatically added to guests bill each day, they provide complimentary champagne at the front desk from 3-12pm. Its a nice touch and good way to pregame or grab a night cap in the lobby. The only issue is that each time we had a glass the champagne was warm. Hopefully this is something they will remedy in the future. Overall front desk staff was very nice. Kristen and Rob were awesome, super nice, fun to interact with and provided great local reco's. The hotel also has a couple of bikes available for guests to use inside the lobby, nice touch.

First of all excellent location as right on the edge of the financial district with Wall Street, world trade centre, city hall, Brooklyn bridge and the Staten Island ferry within easy walking distance. Also have easy access to the subway with an entrance no more than 5- 10 min walking distance from the hotel. So tick on location, in regards to the hotel itself decor very hipster and cool in both the public areas(bar, reception) and the rooms themselves. We had a couple of issues when arriving i.e. had to wait for check in past the usual time as rooms were not ready and was also disappointed by the hotel not fulfilling a request that they had promised to do(placing our wedding flowers from Hawaii in cold storage when they’d arrived a day earlier - we found them left behind reception in their original packing when we arrived having being left there for 24 hours) luckily they survived and Angel the guy checking us in immediately sorted it and also upgraded our room gratis. We had the bed and breakfast deal for 5 days and can’t fault the food and the staff were all excellent! Tip - I’d go for the American breakfast option every time as it set me up for the day. Overall apart from a couple of hiccups we had a good time at the Gild Hall and would stay there again. As mentioned by a few it is great place to start out from if you’re a walker we managed to get to most places around us and only used the subway for sights further afield - Times Square, Central Park etc. Tip - it’s about a 20 min walk to the Staten Island ferry port which is free runs 24 hours and gets you great views of the Statue of Liberty.",,Corriea341,5,4.0

The room was mediocre agreed it was great size compared to other hotels in downtown Manhattan but I wouldn’t say it was as boutique as they offer! Now I don’t come from Anything special but when you are paying a lot of money you want to best possible service around and the rules and regulations to be the same all throughout your 4 Day stay!When we arrived @ the reception I was greeted by van halen ( please forgive me if this was an incorrect name) he offered myself and my partner a glass of Prosecco which was quite refreshing after the long journey! Before heading over on our journey I had correspondence via email about a special occasion and was assured they would send up a bottle and see what else they could do, after reiterating this on check in it was ignored which I found very ignorant.Once at the room we discovered there was only enough towels for 2 people when a family of 4 was staying (other than this the room was good sized and a massive tv alarm clock with usb slots for charging phones) I went down to reception to get more towels and they sent them up which was greatNext day after a long day out sightseeing came back to only 2 towels again I went down to reception again and asked for some extra slightly more p**sed off this time as it was van halen again!The third and final straw was on our last full day after another day out came back to only 2 towels again this time I made sure van halen knew about my frustration he said he would have them sent up, went back to our room and a phone call came around 20 mins later advising us that it is there regulation to only put 2 towels in, these rules must have changed over night as it was van halen who called and advised of this but previously gave extra towels, he also offered free breakfast at the hotels restaurant on the final morning we refused this and up until this moment we are still waiting on towels for the final night and a bottle for our big occasionThe location of the hotel is superb within a 3-4 minute walk from the local subway at Fulton street On checkout it was new staff and they were overly nice and attentive shame they were not on all weekendWe won’t be back or recommending this hotel to others","Glasgow, United Kingdom","bigbeefy88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",15,3.0

The location was good, room was clean and I had a good rest on a lovely bed. The location is on a quiet street that is very close to Wall Street so it's great if you are working nearby. There are several train lines within a 5 minute walk so you can get to anything in NYC fairly easily. The lobby has a cool hipster vibe thanks to the décor that is trendy but also welcoming with oversized leather sofas, bookshelves and antler chandeliers. There is a good Italian restaurant in the lobby which is worth a visit. In my limited exchanges with the staff, everyone was always friendly and helpful.The room is on the small side but it has a high ceiling which made it feel more spacious. The furnishings are very masculine with a big leather headboard, brass fixtures and lots of brown and black. The bed was a highlight - very large and comfortable with 4 fluffy pillows and white linens. There is virtually no sunlight coming in at any time of day due to the tall buildings surrounding it. That was expected but you should be aware if you like a sunny room. The room did have several lamps which I really appreciated and made the room feel much more cozy in the evenings.Here is where it starts to deviate from a 4.5 star hotel. While the décor is nice, the age of the room shows and it feels a bit disjointed as if they took an older hotel and tried to make it more trendy without a full renovation. The television is huge and has basic cable channels but no premium movie channels nor an obvious way to connect your phone to the tv. The overall feel of the room felt very much like a ""man cave"" - I can appreciate the style they were going for but it fell a bit short of what I was expecting from a boutique hotel. The bathroom is the biggest let down with a standard tub and shower head, very limited counterspace and a travel sized hair dryer. There is no natural light and the magnifying mirror is mounted to the wall over the toilet making it fairly useless. The layout makes it hard to put makeup on or even have your products laid out to use. The towels are quite thin and they only leave 2 in the room. Overall it felt very much like you what you find at a 3 star - perfectly serviceable but not what I would expect from a 4.5 star property. Perhaps the other rooms have larger/better bathrooms?While I didn't need much during my stay, I did ask for ice to be brought up and was informed that ice machines were available on certain floors. It did the job but again, didn't feel very luxurious to have to walk the halls in my pajamas collecting ice.Overall, I had a good stay but I suspect the hotel was designed with male business travelers in mind. A few upgrades would make this a bit more friendly for all.","Brooklyn, New York","StefR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",61,3.0

That said, occasionally I will venture well beyond the Four Seasons path and dig out hopefully a hidden gem. The Gild Hall has turned out to be one of those gems which makes me occasionally question why I pay so much money for a luxury hotel when such delights are available at such reasonable pricesI was in NYC recently for some college basketball, and we wanted a place with reasonable prices, good location and a good bar/restaurant so we could hang out a bit. I found Gild Hall on TripAdvisor, and our stay exceeded all expectations we had coming in! This is a big winner. It starts with the price of rooms, but it is much more than that. We got rooms around $200 a night, but the value seemed to be much greater. The location is superb, a walk to South Street Seaport and One World Trade Center, steps from the Brooklyn Bridge, and about 50 yards from the Fulton Street subway. The streets around the hotel are quite quiet, a nice side bonus if you like being a step off the beaten path.The experience starts at check in when they offered me a prosecco, and said we could enjoy more in the lobby between 4pm and 10pm. The rooms are modern and well designed. Attention to detail is impressive in the layouts.The bar lobby is very comfortable and the staff attention to detail is impressive. We ended every night of three there, and they remembered drink orders, made sure the TV was adjusted to come basketball games, and got us some snacks right up to last call.The front desk pointed us towards a cheaper breakfast option for sandwiches and coffee steps from the hotel, and one night at midnight they pointed us to a local Irish bar when the hotel lobby bar closed.The traning for the staff is impressive. People were personable and attentive, right down to the maintenance man who was on the elevator, and the maid cleaning the rooms. Always a 'hello', and asking if we needed anything.This is not a grand hotel, with 500 rooms and the hustle and bustle of New York City spilling into the lobby. This is a smaller island of calm tucked into a quiet corner in lower Manhattan. It is comfortable and focused on making sure you get whatever support you need while a guest there.

The hotel feels hip and friendly, the lobby and restaurant are nicely finished in a way that makes you feel at home, like you could just settle down in a chair and pass some time. But of course, there was no time to actually do that. The room was small, but not too small, and it was comfortable with all the amenities that I could have wanted. Black-out shades ensured a nice, dark sleep. The staff was well-trained and friendly to boot. We liked this hotel and have recommended it to friends. The price is attractive and the breakfast at the restaurant first rate. You might enjoy a stay here. We certainly did.","Reston, Virginia","mastdis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Reston, Virginia</strong>",107,4.0

The staff were so friendly and couldn't do enough to make us feel welcome. They would make a point of striking up conversation with you when passing through reception. The only thing I didn't like was they charge an extra $20 a night for faster WiFi, free calls to other New York numbers and complimentary fizz in the bar at a certain time of day. This wasn't optional and was just added on. Although what a waste of money if you don't need or want any of those things? The WiFi that was included in the original room price was fast enough for what we needed and we were going to be out all the time exploring so wouldn't be there for the fizz. We also didn't need to ring anyone in New York as we didn't know anyone there!It would probably be useful for someone there on business but for us it was just throwing away $20 a night.

The entire hotel (Reception, Rooms and Restaurant included) is very classy and atmospheric, I'd highly recommend visiting during the evening to make the most of it. During our celebration drinks, we took some time to take it all in and have a chat with the guy behind the bar (Mr Mee, thanks for your advice!).And, when the reception staff found out about our engagement, we returned to our room the next day and found a wonderful fruit basket, a bottle of prosecco and a handwritten note congratulating us.

Happy to report that we had an excellent stay. Despite our great overall experience, I can see why people's experiences with the hotel can vary. I think at Gild Hall's price point, the expectation automatically becomes higher. However, I do think that the rate certainly also is a function of having centrally located in New York.Check-in was quick, we came by early, they didn't have our room ready yet, but they gladly stored our luggage as we explored the city. When we came back for our room key, they offered welcome drinks, which we gladly accepted. We went for the Premium King Size room and we were assigned one on the 5th floor. The room was probably recently renovated, it had a premium look with leather and earth tones. However, the bathroom was probably not completely gutted out during the reno, it definitely has character. Sliding glass door was slightly rickety. The tub and the shower head didn't look as modern. But the water pressure was great, and everything worked to its purpose. The bed and the pillows were super comfortable and the room was generally quiet.Service wise, I did notice that the restaurant was a bit shorthanded during their breakfast service on our last day there. But, I do think the people they have tried their best and did step up to the plate. Props to Van Halen at the front desk, he was super helpful! I would definitely stay here again if I'm in town.

A tremendous attention to detail would appear to be the hallmark of this hotel. the room had several wine options and a wide array of snacks available for purchase. In addition in the bathroom was a full (high quality) shaving kit for purchase. While I didn't need it on this trip -- I have in the past and would have been appreciative of the convenience. There was also a hand-written note form Caitlin with a welcome box of Italian cookies from Felice, the on-site restaurant.The first morning of my stay I received a text message asking if there was anything the team could do for me. In fact there was, I needed a dress shirt pressed. Within 5 minutes I received the response, there was a laundry 4 doors down. Problem solved.I sat at the bar for dinner at Felice both nights of my stay. Menu options were broad and food quality was very good. I had the bolognese one night and the ravioli the next (although I must say the serving size on the ravioli left me wanting). Excellent selection of wines (not inexpensive to be sure -- that may be my only criticism).Upon checkout I checked my bags and was given an umbrella for the several block walk to my meeting -- it was pouring out! When I returned I was under a time crunch to get to Penn station -- one memeber of the team went out in the pouring rain to check pricing from the car services lines up outside -- he then took me to the car, loaded my bags and gave me the umbrella for use when I arrived at Penn Station. I was certainly capable of taking care of myself -- but the level of interest in helping was impressive -- and appreciated.If ever my business schedule takes me to the financial district -- I'll be returning to Gild Hall and I am 100% certain to stay there on kmy next leisure trip to the city.","Plymouth, Massachusetts","S2620KDjohno</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plymouth, Massachusetts</strong>",3,5.0

When you arrive, they offer champagne and just simply go out of their way to help. The room service menu is pretty good, food is delicious. I just wish they had more of a variety and were open later. Given the neighborhood is the Financial District, it does close down early so I can understand the reason for closing the restaurant earlier. The hotel location is fantastic and there are some good bars and restaurants within walking distance. I would stay here again for sure. Truly - this hotel is a gem and the reviews support this statement. Here are some opportunities but certainly does not discourage me: 1) Room Service closes down early but one can always do door dash or some food delivery; 2) The restaurant and bar staff is not the friendliest.

Initially our welcome was fab in reception and our room wasn’t ready so we stored our luggage. We came back shortly afterwards to receive our key and settle in to our room. Although it was only 4pm we had travelled from the UK so it was late for us and we were tired. No welcome drink had been offered to us despite having to pay for this in the facility charge. I am being picky when I say we had no offer to transport our luggage to our room as it doesn’t really bother me but in every other 5 star hotel the staff have been insistent on delivering our luggage to the room. I had a bath immediately - the water was yellow? And the bath wasn’t big enough for a soak. There were no bathrobes or slippers as suggested and the soap was out of the packet with the wrapper in the bin which leads me to believe someone else had been in the room before us. The worst part of the room is no coffee or tea making facilities. I queried this and was brought a kettle. A bit pointless without tea, milk etc and cups. Anyway they have now brought me 2 cups and I have been advised to go to the shop round the corner to purchase tea etc. Honestly I have never stayed in a hotel before where this had not been included. The previous night we stayed in a Travelodge which cost £32 for the night and there was tea/coffee making facilities. There was an offer by staff to say they would see what they could do but nothing has been done at present. The complimentary WiFi is a con as you pay for this in the facility charge. Hopefully my next few days will be much better. On a positive the location is fab! Also this is a deluxe room that I have paid for and not the cheapest.","Barnsley, United Kingdom","881Andrea</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barnsley, United Kingdom</strong>",31,3.0

We had an excellent time at Gild Hall and after our experience would recommend this property to anyone going to NYC. First- the price! This is defiantly a bang for your buck hotel. It felt luxury and 5 star for a steal for a price. Located in the Financial District it was the most quiet hotel we have ever stayed in in NYC. Access to the subway was incredibly convenient and since the hotel is located on more of a ""side street,"" pick up and drop off from an uber/lyft/cab is simple and not rushed. We were greeted by the front desk staff, who were very friendly and were actually able to check in early. We also somehow managed to get a room upgrade in the process. While I understand this is all based on availability and luck, we were so pleased with this high level of customer service. The room was clean and comfy and we WISH WE COULD HAVE TAKEN THE BED HOME WITH US! We stopped by the front desk for the free champagne toast at 4PM which was a nice perk before heading out for the evening. The attached restaurant was decently affordable, swanky and worked for a quick meal when we arrived. The only slight ""issue"" we had was that our room was not refreshed during our 2 night stay. We are not sure if we left up the DND sign, but regardless it didn't make our break our experience at all. The hotel staff grabbed us some new towels very quickly without interrupting our getting ready. Honestly, it was a 5 star experience and we were lucky to have found Gild Hall.

I stayed on 14, one of the floors with an ice machine (not all of them have them).The details in the room are thought out, robes, umbrellas, mini bar, (very expensive, $9 for water) safe, qtips, and basic soaps and lotions. I didn't love the blinds, no black out curtains :( it still let some of the light in, though the buildings are so close so there isn't a ton of light overall. The room is clean, the sheets and towels felt great, and there was good hooks up for electronics, in the desk, and the lamps, and in the clock.

Our room was very small, with 14 foot ceilings which made the space feel unbalanced. A study in black, brown and grey, the room was furnished badly with black brown wood everywhere and two toned wallpaper in dull shades of grey and cat puke orange/yellow. Even the art on the walls was unattractive. The main light was a dim giant chandelier with no switch near the bed and no bedside lamps, so I had to get out of bed to turn out the light and then feel my way back to bed. The one window had wooden blinds that didn't fully block the city light at night and curtains that were solely decorative.

A pipe burst and flooded my apartment leaving me no choice but to check into a hotel. From the very start, I knew this was the place for me to stay while my apartment was in tatters. First, I was able to get through to an actual human on the phone. I called other hotels but unable to reach anyone, decided this was a big point in favor of Gild Hall. The manager took my call and took pity on me, allowing me an extra early check-in of ""whenever I was ready"" given my circumstance. Upon arrival, they upgraded my room and made me feel at home. During my stay, the reception staff was beyond accommodating for my needs. PROS:An intimate, comfortable haven within Manhattan. Small but amply equipped rooms make you feel cozy and happy. Mini bar prices are also reasonable in case you want an impromptu snack without breaking the bank. There are tons of small restaurants nearby and places to buy groceries if you like, plus the in-house restaurant, Felice, is part of the Sant Ambroues family--score! Guaranteed good food and wine! The hotel has free bikes for loan and because of its size, design and location, the spot feels like a lodge hotel in Aspen as opposed to a hotel in New York City. For the price, you are getting a great, stylish hotel with friendly service. The staff is incredible. PLUS, it's pet-friendly! CONS:Essentially, there are no cons in this hotel for a few reasons. Although if I were to pick one I would say its location in the Financial District is slightly displaced from most Manhattan life BUT there is so much transport within a few minutes walk from the hotel that it is easy to get to where you want to be. Any cons you may have are easily overlooked by the price, style, comfort and service of this hotel.OVERALL:I highly recommend. You stay at Gild Hall because you want a unique boutique experience and service at a great price all within New York City.

Eggs were done perfectly, cheese was excellent, the coffee was also very good as was the fresh OJ. My one complaint was the young lady who served me on the Saturday brunch -- she was cranky and acted like it was a burden to serve us... there was literally just myself and my mother in the restaurant at that time. The server gave nothing by way of friendliness, but certainly had the market cornered on a bad attitude (For that reason alone, I give the service 4 starts versus 5.) towards two people who were very low-key and undemanding.

The hotel is tucked away from the hustle and bustle, yet still convenient for the likes of Broadway, Wall St and tourist attractions such as Battery Park, Staten Island Ferry and the 9/11 Memorial. The hotel itself is really quirky and the staff are super friendly and so helpful. We stayed for 7 days. Our room was made up each day. Fresh towels and toiletries and our room was a really great size compared to some of the reviews we'd read on Trip Advisor regarding small hotel rooms in NYC. My family and I were unfortunately caught up in the recent snowstorm which hit the eastern seaboard, which meant our flight home to the UK was cancelled. Prior to heading to the airport David, who we think was the hotel manager assured us that a room would be available for us if it was required at short notice - which we subsequently did. The reception staff were very knowledgeable regarding places to eat and visit and we would certainly have no hesitation in recommending Gild Hall to other travellers considering a visit to NYC.

It was located about 5 minutes walk from the World Trade Centre station (and the beautiful Oculus) and dangerously close to Century 21 and Eataly (get read to spend!). The hotel was everything you can want: hip decor, friendly and attentive staff, very comfortable room with an excellent bed King size bed, and a restaurant downstairs (Felice) that was incredible! They texted the morning of the second day to check in on us and make sure we are comfortable. When we responded that the room was a bit cold, they brought a technician in immediately to check on the heater. Eventually it was an issue that was solved by bringing in a separate heater that kept us nice and toasty. Overall it was an excellent stay in a hip hotel that I would describe as industrial meets rustic lodge decor with a personalized touch that really stood out from my experiences with other hotels. I would highly recommend Gild Hall to anyone visiting NYC!","Toronto, Canada","Tamar N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",1,5.0

Which makes it sound like this review is going to be mixed but it's really not, I'd strongly recommend it,Location is great. This was our first time to NYC and we took the same approach as we do for London - being near a tube/subway station is more important than the location per se. The hotel is close to the Fulton St subway and is within walking distance of Wall Street, 911 memorial and museum, Statue of Liberty and Battery Park. Once we got the hang of the subway (not every train stops at every station on that line) we were fine with getting around.Staff were really helpful and friendly - in fact they were superb and we couldn't fault them. We checked in early and were given a choice of rooms (our preference was for 'quiet' over a view). Every time we interacted with anyone from the hotel they were professional and went above and beyond what we expected. Our room was warm feeling, quiet and comfortable. It was also really clean. A problem with the wardrobe door was sorted quickly. Being from England, I would have liked to have had tea/coffee making facilities and the water pressure/temp in the shower could have been higher but we enjoyed spending what little time we did there and slept really well. We ate thanksgiving dinner in the restaurant, it was very nice, and very reasonably priced.

Beautiful decor in the lobby, on arrival we were offered beer or prosecco (we chose the beer) and were given a very warm welcome. The room itself was lovely, very clean and stylish. I have to admit from reading other reviews I was concerned about the translucent bathroom door. It was absolutely fine, the wall on the side of the toilet is thicker anyway and there is a heavy grey curtain to pull across too. One time my partner went in there and forgot to pull the curtain across, and I still couldn't see anything so don't be put off if you like your privacy! It's absolutely fine!It was our anniversary and we received a knock on the door in the early evening, where we were presented with a bottle of prosecco and a huge plate of delicious fruit to wish us a happy anniversary. It was such a lovely gesture, we were both delighted! The room is not soundproof so we could hear the traffic and the subway trains rumbling outside, but for us this added to the experience of New York rather than being a nuisance. Just be careful when walking around the bed, as the wooden bed frame sticks out further than the mattress and both of us caught our legs on it a couple of times! This hotel is in the financial district, so it is walking distance to Wall Street, the World Trade Center & 9/11 Memorial, as well as to the Statue of Liberty Cruises. You will need to get the subway to go up to Times Square and Central Park (although one day we walked everywhere and ended up walking 15 miles in total!)

I called the front desk and they sent up a technician and unfortunately no improvement can be made. It's an old building with A/C window units which require LOUD HARD PROPULSION and power. I doubt I will sleep tonight. I travel a ton , and quite frankly, the hotel should have informed me about this issue. hotels are fore sleeping after all. Also the windows have curtain that are decorative (not functional) so stop short of blocking out the late. All I can say are there are other choices (i.e. 1 Brooklyn Bridge) for the smae price. More modern and accommodating than this place. Sorry to be so negative as the staff were sweet and tried to help.

We were greeted with a bottle of Pinot Noir in our room and complimentary breakfast, both of which were excellent. The room itself, a King Premium, was spacious by NYC standards with very high ceilings, huge TV, comfy bed and plenty of room for everything. I can't fault it and we've been lucky and stayed at many great hotels in all areas of Manhattan on previous trips. The Gild Hall is probably the smallest that we have stayed at but the service we received was outstanding. It was impeccably clean throughout and the lobby and bar areas were very cool. The location is very convenient to Brooklyn and we enjoyed exploring FiDi, an area that were not too familiar with before this trip.

That aside, the staff was really friendly, very accommodating and extremely helpful.The suite itself was quiet, comfortable and had all the amenities (and more) you'd expect from this wonderful space - a deep soaking tub with bath salts and a candle, a full bar with leather stools (you have to pay for the liquor, of course) and comfy bathrobes and slippers. We felt so pampered. The icing on the cake was the bottle of wine and handwritten note they left us the night of our wedding.

Since our very first stay, David Finch has stood out at the front desk as the best example of hotel hospitality that we have ever experienced. We have travelled extensively, and have hesitated to publicly review our experience at Gild Hall because it was our ""secret gem"" when visiting the financial district. David is polite, efficient and so helpful that my husband and I felt completely comfortable when our daughter had an extended solo stay at Gild Hall for two summers in NYC. David Finch and the rest of the amazing staff at Gild Hall made my daughter and the rest of our family feel so at home, that whenever we visit NYC, even when our business dictates stays at other hotels, we make it a point to stop in at Gild Hall to greet our friends there, especially David. Stopping at Gild Hall feels like ""coming home"". It is a small European - like boutique hotel that takes us away from the busy pace of the Manhattan streets.  Another great aspect of this cozy hotel is that it is connected to a wonderful restaurant called Felice. The staff is warm and welcoming, and the food is delicious. We can vouch for this for breakfast, lunch and dinner. If your travels take you to the financial district of NYC, look up David Finch at Gild Hall. He will be sure that you are well taken care of, and visit Felice to enjoy their food and service. It is all quiet and unassuming, and I hope you will feel at home like our family does every time we visit.

Yes, there was city noise at all hours of the night, but it wasn't terrible. What WAS terrible, were the impossible-to-sleep on pillows. The location is pretty great for the financial district, but the problem is... the financial district isn't really a tourist-y destination.

I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel. The lobby is gorgeous and smells great. The room was beautiful, with its bathroom clad in espresso marble and smoky glass tile, leather furniture, and stunning chandelier over the bed. The king size bed was incredibly comfortable and was decked out in luxurious Sferra linens. The toiletries smell divine. The location is amazing. The restaurant, Felice, has delicious food and outstanding cocktails. But the absolute best thing about this hotel was the staff. From the minute I walked in, soaking wet in sweatpants and carrying cats, I was treated so kindly and respectfully. Throughout my stay, every single person that worked there made sure my cats and I were perfectly at home. All the managers and front desk staff- Kolby, Rob, Dea, Thomas, Andy, David, Max, Mark, Anthony, John, Angel, Mosey, & Van Hallen, as well as the house men Thupten, Ringin, & Ryan, knew my situation and were genuinely concerned with how I was handling my troubles. Their support was very helpful to me. The complimentary proseco in the lobby was also very helpful! At the end of all this drama, I left Gild Hall feeling like I made a bunch of new friends and I will definitely be back to visit!

Why stay in a regular chain hotel like Marriott when you can stay in a boutique hotel for $180 a night? Esp in financial district that's one block away from the federal reserve?After a very stressful day of driving around in the city, we arrived at Gild hall around 9pm. I was exhausted so I just pulled up right in front of Gild hall's front door, and walk in. I didn't even lock my car doors, that never happens! And that just shows how tired I was. Rob at the front desk greeted me with a huge warm smile, and told me ""we will do everything we can to make your stay a great one, relax, we got you!"", and offered me a glass of chilled champagne. That immediately took a huge load of weight off my shoulders. While he was looking for the best room available for my handicap family friend, a valet approached me for my car key and handed me a valet tag for my car. In less than 3 minutes, my car was taken care of, 2 rooms keys were in my hand, a glass of chilled champagne in my other hand, and we were waiting for the elevator to go up to our room.Our room was on the 9th floor, the hall way might not look like much but our room was breath taking! This is the definition of a boutique hotel. We were suppose to have dinner in Felice, the hotel restaurant, but my companion loved our room so much that they did not want to leave, I had to walk to Eataly to buy dinner for them. Look at what you did Rob!!!! Because we are a group of 3 people and there was only one king size bed in our room, Rob offered to have our sofa bed made whenever we are ready for it. We called the front desk around 9:30pm to have it made and someone showed up at our door with a full set of bedding within 10 minutes.

Since my husband loves the Battery Park area, I decided to give the Gild Hall a shot. Boy, were we glad we did!It was raining and we couldn't catch a cab from Penn Station. So we decided to take the subway. It wasn't difficult to get to the hotel via the subway. But locating the hotel in the rain took quite a bit of effort. Once we found the entrance (somewhat misleading since the hotel's address was Gold street but the entrance was on Platt), everything went smoothly. Firstly, check in was a breeze and the lady who checked us in was very nice and friendly. The room we got was well appointed and on the larger side for NYC standards. I go to NYC a lot and am used to tiny rooms. Here we had room to spread out a little. The bathroom was also on the larger side though we had issues with the sink and shower. Somehow the sink splashes out a lot of water like the sink bowl is too small for the faucet. Not sure why. But no worries as using the towel to dry it off was a simple fix. As for the shower, it didn't drain fast enough and we would be showering in a pool of water. It didn't bother us enough to complain though.What blew us away was the friendly staff that strive to go above and beyond for us. They would greet us each time they see us. Even offered water to us several times including when we were waiting for our ride after checking out. As part of my Expedia elite status, I was given $20 mini bar credit and free premium wifi which was nice. But mind you, the minibar is expensive so $20 doesn't get you much. While en route to the hotel, I cut my foot in the rain against the sidewalk and found myself bleeding and bruised after checking into the hotel. I called front desk and a staff member showed up almost instantly and gave me a bunch of band aid, alcohol rub and antiseptic cream. I truly appreciated it as going to a pharmacy in the rain would have further infected my foot. Happy to report that my foot is healing well without having to go get a tetanus shot!The location is convenient and central. It is close to the WTC and a lot of food and shopping spots. We were able to walk everywhere and it was convenient for us to get to where we wanted to go. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. I highly recommend this place for adults traveling without children and professionals. You won't regret coming here. The reason I specified adults only was because it doesn't appear to be a place that a family with children would like. There is a thriving bar in the lobby and the room's minibar came with a box filled with adult toys. I am guessing this is not kid appropriate.",Maryland,"funtravelfreak</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maryland</strong>",68,5.0

(ie restaurant changed ownership and as a hotel guest could not ever get a seat at either bar or reservation), Enter David (front desk manager) and company (Robert/John/lquiet gentle housekeeping etc.). When we pull up to valet they are actually waiting for us...I can't believe that I am in NYC (which I love but it does go fast and to stay here pulls you right out of the pace), The lobby is small but so comfortable...the furnishings remind me of a ski lodge in the 1980's out west. Some of the things are European (ie never enough hooks in the bathroom and the layout of some rooms is very different than an American hotel) but I think that this adds to its charm. One GEM is Felice the restaurant bar. Mena (right from the BOOT in Italy) makes you feel like you are in Italy...service is so warm....and the menu/food...oh my, you can't miss. The bar is delightful hosting regular customers as well as hotel guests and folks who live in the neighborhood.

It has the small boutique feel that guests who enjoy a lot of character will find comfortable for business travel. It has a lot of great details that make it work from the leather headboards to the excellent showers and bathtubs (in-suites) along with good products and proximity to the rest of Wall Street. The rooms are of excellent size for hotels in the neighborhood though you won't find spectacular views (that's just not part of how Fidi hotels work, go uptown if you need a fancy view). But the lack of views make for a quite respite. It is a very masculine hotel which makes the story I'm about to tell all the more charmingI actually have a very different relationship with the hotel than the average guest and have stayed with numerous occasions but notably for special occasions. Why? Well it is where I first met my husband. I happened to be out of my apartment and was staying at Gild Hall when I accepted a date with what was to become my now husband. The very comfortably upstairs lobby and lovely restaurant are now part of our story. We now have tried to stay at Gild Hall on our anniversaries when we can. We've even booked out the largest suite to have a gathering of friends celebrate with us as we've come to love the property so much (keeping in mind that we live within a few blocks of the hotel) Alas today May 10th is our anniversary and we aren't spending it at Gild Hall but I'm hoping that in the next week or two we can find a way to do another stay.","New York, New York, United States","Julie F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, New York, United States</strong>",11,5.0

The brief conversations in passing were uplifting and joyful, which made the downpour we had sloshed through trivial and in the past. The room, even though opposite the elevator, was so quiet! The shower is great, the water is instantly hot, the lighting is perfect. I didn't care for the frosted glass enclosure of the bathroom, however.

Stylish, spotlessly clean, quiet, affordable, secure, and conveniently located in the FiDi. The room was very spacious for a NY hotel with room for king bed, two chairs, full desk, suitcase stand, and plenty of room to walk around. Very chic decor. I am a very light sleeper, and I barely heard a sound up on the 17th floor even with construction nearby. No sound from nearby rooms. Very cute restaurant and wine bar. The room came with a choice of Continental or American breakfast, which turned out to be a huge plate of eggs, bacon or sausage, and potatoes or delicious grain toast, with really strong and wonderful coffee. Servers and desk staff were so nice. Bathroom was spotless with nice products and very strong water pressure. The bathroom door/wall is glass, but there is a curtain hung if you want privacy. Fully stocked mini bar with plenty of snacks if you need them. Plenty of outlets for charging the devices, which isn't the case in a lot of hotels. Very comfortable bed and pillows. A suggestion -- the puffy quilt had a nice soft duvet, but the bed could use a single top sheet for those of us who get hot and cold during the night. Also, the first night, the bath had 2 small bath towels, 2 hand towels, and 2 wash cloths, but the second night a single big, beautiful plush bath sheet appeared (but no wash cloths).

While the tap water in the bathroom is drinkable, a kettle to boil water would have been nicer and most hotels do provide one.(2) there should be an option for half day checkout.

As to design, the exterior is red brick and the ground floor and lobby area is really dominated by Felice, the in-hotel restaurant and bar. The lobby space, featuring a library of books with nice bindings and no intrinsic value or particular interest is rather cramped and overshadowed by Felice, as mentioned. Guest rooms and other inner design features are difficult to describe as I've never seen anything quite like the odd chandelier high ceiling lights and brown leatherette bed headboards with straps and buckles and the blue and gilt hues of the walls. The hotel describes the motif as a blend of ""Aspen"" American rustic and European understated elegance courtesy of a world-acclaimed architect and designer. I'm saying here that it's best to check out the pictures themselves on the hotel web site.With all that odd lighting, the room could still have been brighter. The bar area at peak times can be quite cramped and noisy, but more of that when I review Felice, where we delightfully dined a number of times during our stay. In fact, cramped is also a word I'd use to describe the entire neighborhood down here with trucks and cars and delivery vehicles trying to negotiate the impossibly narrow streets and alleys and with constant construction creating further blockades and the cavernous buildings blocking out the sun. I grew up on the upper west side and my wife was raised in the West Village and we were both happy when we had business at certain points in the ""wild blue yonder uptown"". Still the great graciousness of the entire staff made the experience worthwhile. On Saturday night around rush hour we tried to get a cab (impossible) in the icy rain. At which point the front desk folks put on heavy jackets, hats and umbrellas and walked quite a distance to finally flag down a cab for us as we waited snugly in the lobby. We showed our gratitude, but the attitude of the front desk persons was: ""No problem, we are just doing our job"". No substitute for that kind of grace.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","TommyBoy94</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",746,4.0

On the plane back to Canada I was thinking about the hotel and the trip and I realized that I'd been spoiled, this was only the fourth time in over 12 years that I stayed at a non-Thompson hotel. And comparing this stay with my previous vacation, 31 day stay in New York during the summer, just emphasizes how fantastic Gild Hall is.I was going to write about the amazing staff last in this review but they are truly the crown jewel for the hotel, without a doubt the most valuable asset of Gild Hall and it just seems pointless to try and describe the hotel without detailing the individual things that make you feel special and valued. I love the front desk staff at this hotel. They are so competent and cheerful and friendly, qualities that I think are pretty hard to display when they have arguably the toughest job of the hotel. If any visitors are unhappy with anything, regardless of it having to do with the hotel or not, the front desk people are going to bear the brunt of it. At Gild Hall I have had nothing but positive interactions with each one of them. Led by managers Monique and David, I was always treated like a VIP. Max checked me in, what a great person he is. Seems like a jack of all trades, and when you stay at a hotel for 31 days you have the opportunity to see staff with other guests and it’s pretty impressive the level of care that people like Max and Rob treat other guests with. Any of the front desk staff that saw me when I entering or left the hotel during my stay would wave and smile and all remembered my name. Sometimes when I would be in the lobby reading I could hear them interact with other guests and saw that they treated others the same way that I was treated. This is especially important in a boutique hotel and even more evident after my stay in Las Vegas. It is the mark of an excellent hotel and one where Gild really excels. I'm sorry for the people who's names I've forgotten, I can picture you in my memory but your names escape me and it's my fault for doing this review so late but I really do appreciate how welcome you made me feel.The bellman here are fantastic! I saw these guys multiple times each day and they were great and hard working. Really nice to talk to ""regular people"" when you are way from home so long and these guys are the friends from home that you can talk with about everything from sports to restaurants. Really appreciated my conversations with them and also appreciated how hard they worked to try and help other guests too. I also have great things to stay about the housekeeping staff who were highly curtious and efficient. My room was always cleaned perfectly and I had a few phone calls from a housekeeping supervisor during my stay to ensure that I was happy with the room. And over the last couple stays I’ve run into an engineer named Topeton; man this guy is an asset to the hotel! Super dedicated and outstanding service.Lastly, I was happy to bump into the General Manager Mr. Koster, who went to great lengths to check in with me and ensure that I was enjoying NYC numerous times during my stay. Occasionally I would see him and other staff when they were ""off duty"" on their way home and they were just as cheerful and genuine as they are back at the hotel. One of the nice things about this hotel is that it doesn't seem to employ a ton of staff members so you do see the same people and it is really nice to have a familiar person during your stay, especially if you travel solo.Gild Hall Hotel is truly excellent in every single category that I value. The hotel itself is very stylish and really well constructed. Gild had just completed a room renovation and all I can say is that the rooms fit the Thompson style perfectly! I wasn’t crazy about the decor of the rooms before the renovation but this one is totally my style. I’ve included some pictures but you can see more on the website. The lobby and public spaces really suit the FIDI district and when you sit down in one of the leather chairs or sofas I am reminded of sitting in a modern, masculine den or lounge. It's a place where you feel very comfortable in relaxing while waiting or contemplating your next move. The atmosphere of the hotel with the music and lighting seems to be perfectly suited at all times. Walk around the hotel a few blocks and you can see why FIDI is one of the more expensive places in Manhattan to live. Such character in the streets and neighborhood, you are literally located at the birthplace of NYC. Tons of restaurants are around, including some pretty hot ones in Gild’s sister property The Beekman Hotel. The South Street Seaport use to be a tourist trap but has evolved into a really cool area with tons of restaurants and pubs and a fantastic new movie theater. I use to run each morning I was at the hotel and I quickly grew attached to the area. I needed to because the new Eataly just opened up a few blocks from the hotel lol. Over to the west, you have the new Westview World Trade Center mall within the Oculus and just across West street the shops at Brookfield Place. And a super fun french food hall called Le District. Dining is one of the things I look forward to when traveling and it's so convenient to be able to eat at so many great spots and be able to walk back to the hotel rather than take a cab. And you don't have to spend a lot of money with entertainment in NYC either; there is 3 different movie theaters, Whole Foods, Barnes and Noble, and most importantly… a Shake Shake all just a few blocks away. Other conveniences of staying at Gild Hall include transportation; there are 4 major subway lines all within three blocks of the hotel. You can get anywhere in the city within 30 minutes by transit.While the location will definitely attract people for business others who value this hotel will be young (and older) travelers, not tourists. People who appreciate the nicer things in life and don't mind spending a little to enjoy good food, wine and clothing. If you value your time and convenience over a dollar, you appreciate quality over quantity, if you prefer to be treated as a neighborhood friend rather than as visiting royalty then you are going to be right at home at Gild Hall. It's run by a hotel group that has a strong concept of what its guests value and has employed staff who believe in that experience. The people who work here truly make Gild the hotel that it is. I have referred several people to stay at Gild and they all have raved about it. The staff here have delivered the same experiences to my friends that made each trip so special to me and I personally cannot put a high enough value on this experience. When a hotel contributes so many positive memories to your experience they earn your loyalty and this is why I will be staying at Gild Hall whenever I am able.","Calgary, Canada","Ken R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",21,5.0

Gild Hall is quietly located on a small side street in the Financial District which I found to be so peaceful. I was able to coveniently park my car in front to check in. Checking in I was assisted by Andy and David. Both gentlemen made the process so easy and were genuinely pleasant. The style and decor of Gild Hall is so point. Unlike the other hotels that I researched i the area I didn't feel as if I was staying in a conference center. I had the luxury of booking the Pent House and boy was it amazing. The room was very spacious and extremely useful. I absolutely adored the leather bed and how even more so how comfortable it was. I slept like a baby!

We wished we had had stayed here for the entire stay we loved it that much. The night we arrived in NY we had huge issues with our shuttle bus as it was over 2 hours late collecting us from the airport (that's completely unrelated to the hotel). When we finally arrived at the hotel we were greeted with warm smiles and helpful staff. We immediately felt completely at home as the hotel had a warm cozy feel. Upon check in I shared our shuttle experience with the young guy at reception and he without hesitation offered us a couple of complimentary drinks in the bar. This was a most grateful touch as it was in no way the hotel's fault our shuttle experience was poor. The room was very modern and in great condition. The whole hotel appeared to be recently renovated which was great. The Italian restaurant Felice at the hotel was amazing and was buzzing every night we were there. We loved it so much on the 1st night that we ate breakfast in the morning then dinner again on final evening. Price and quality wise is was probably our best dining experience in NY. The hotel being in FIDI is well away from the chaos that's Times Square. Its located close to the 911 memorial and museum and the ferry to Liberty Island. It's an easy walk to the Brooklyn Bridge as well. Stone Street which is short walk from the hotel has some great bars and restaurants and is located on a pedestrian only cobble stone street.

But beyond all of this, that would have already been enough for us to want to come back, the absolutely best thing about Gild Hall, hands down, is the excellent, kind service we received from everyone working in the hotel. They went out of their way to help us and make us feel at home. When my older father's flight arrived 5 hours late at 2:00 a.m., Fitore helped him to his room with his suitcase and a bottle of water to make his ordeal a little more manageable. Every day we were received with smiles and help with directions, tickets, suggestions, and everything else we could possibly need or want.

We didn't think that would be a problem at first, but unfortunately the stairs seemed to be used a lot and the door was heard opening and shutting during the night. Our first night was horrible as the couple in the next room decided to argue and shout at each other from 11pm until 2:30am in the morning. We rang reception during the night and understand that it was not the hotel's fault but would have hoped it was handled with greater urgency. We really value a good night's sleep when on vacation so this was obviously frustrating.On the second day a wet patch appeared on the floor next to my husband's side of the bed (may be from the air-conditioning unit on the wall) and grew each day which made the room feel damp. I would like to mention of the housekeeping team as they were extremely friendly and thorough when cleaning our room, leaving little thank you notes and happily meeting our request for additional blankets. We have stayed in NYC many times and anticipate that the rooms are a little smaller than other cities. I only wish there had of been a little more closet space and a robe provided for the room. The room was showing a little wear and tear with furniture chipped and peeling. The location was fantastic, close to the subway, dry cleaners and a quick walk to places like Pressed Juice, Sweetgreen, Eately and the new Westfield Shopping Center.

We were a party of 4 and would recommend this hotel to all of our friends. Our room was lovely, peaceful and quiet. The bed and the pillows.... Well what can we say, it felt like being wrapped in a loving softness that is too hard to describe. Our only gripe is that breakfast on Sunday morning was a shambles. My husband was ill with food poisoning so I joined ny friend with her husband, they ordered the continental breakfast and I ordered the American breakfast. We waited nearly 50 minutes, when my friends asked for their orange juice they were brought tomato ketchup !!!! The waiter then brought one orange juice and one grapefruit juice seriously ??? We felt that people who were coming in for breakfast were given priority to the guests staying in the hotel. We paid a lot of money to stay here so really feel strongly that we should have been looked after too. On our first morning we were given teapots after that it was a cup with a tea bag to be told sorry we have no teapots. Please you must be consistent. Would this put us off NO, but hotel staff please remember to look after your guests. Our money is just as good as Joe Bloggs off the street !!!! I couldn't fault the staff on their knowledge of the subway and all their advice. This was me and hubby's 3 rd time to NYC and we will not be returning...

Switching to the Gild Hall is the best decision we could have made. Our experience of the hotel was fantastic from start to finish - our only regret is probably that we made so little use of the hotel, we were up and out early each day and not back until late in the evening. The accommodation itself was great, we opted for a suite and were situated up on the 9th floor and we were blown away by the size of the room. The bed is the most comfortable I've ever experienced in any hotel - we both had wonderful nights' sleeps despite us both being notoriously light sleepers in ""strange"" beds. There was no traffic noise at all. The bathroom was excellent too.Don't assume (as we did initially) that you need to be in the thick of things by staying up in Midtown. We found getting around to be an absolute breeze - no more than 5 mins walk from the hotel to Fulton Street subway and no more than 15 mins or so on the frequent subway trains and you're up in Times Square.We can't speak for the restaurant, Felice, as we tended to eat out every day but it looked fantastic.I can't recommend the hotel enough.","Leicestershire, United Kingdom","MarkHuddlestone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leicestershire, United Kingdom</strong>",21,5.0

Having previously visited New York and stayed near Times Square I was weary of being some distance from the main tourist hub but found this to be no issue. On arrival myself and the girlfriend were given complimentary prosecco (she had mine too!) and as our room wasn't ready were given complimentary drinks vouchers. We had to rush out prior to using them as we had a Mets game to catch (they won!) so used them for more prosecco from reception on our return. The hotel is 20 minutes by subway from Times Square - close enough to be an easy commute on the 2/3 trains but far enough to get away from the hustle and bustle and annoying street vendors. In fact this hotel was more ideal for the Brooklyn Bridge, World Trade Centre, Statue of Liberty and other attractions at the south end of Manhattan. The room we booked was massive for New York standards with separate living and bed room, large walk in showers and his'n'hers sinks. The kitchenette was basic but usable. The room has it's quirks - there is no minibar - but items are left lying around the room with a single price card in the kitchen! The cleaning staff were fantastic - a few mornings we were late heading out and they didn't mind coming back later in the day. They also thoughtfully arranged the girlfriends beauty products on the 'make up' table and provided extra flannels for her. The included breakfast vouchers were only valid up until 11am despite it being available until 2pm on weekends, this wasn't mentioned on the vouchers and therefore our plan for brunch was foiled on the second day but subsequent mornings were set up with a good American breakfast of sesame seed bread toast, fantastic scrambled egg and bacon. Checkout was just as easy and the concierge/doorman was great in grabbing us a yellow cab cable of taking 2 people + 4 suitcases to LGA - saved us over $50 compared to an Uber/Town Car.Definitely stay again if the price was right - keep an eye out for deals on the booking sites!","Liverpool, United Kingdom","feelthetensean</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liverpool, United Kingdom</strong>",8,5.0

I'm not sure why they did this, but the front desk gladly gave us clean towels. 2.

The hotel isn't the easiest to find if you're just going off street names, it's nicely tucked away off any major streets, if you're coming from Fulton Street St and turn onto Gold Street, just keep walking, you will see it eventually.After a prompt check-in, we were blown away by our room, the room was huge for city standards never mind New York standards which we had been warned about, the bathrooms are lovely and modern, and the air conditioner very effective. The rooms were cleaned to a high standard each day, and although our room was near to the elevators we were not disrupted at all at any point in our trip.Unfortunately we didn't have the easiest ride in NYC with lost baggage, cancelled and delayed flights (obviously nothing to do with the hotel), but we could not have asked for more in terms of customer service, helpfulness and pure cheerfulness.

Unfortunately, my second stay wasn't as good.Yes, the rooms are large with high ceilings, and have very nice fittings. It's the service that seems to have dropped.I noticed over my six day stay that I was treated a lot differently if I was dressed up, or down. If I was dressed in casual clothes (to do siteseeing in the heat), I wasn't acknowledged in the lobby - or had the door held open. However when I was dressed up, the staff were all smiles and ""hello's"".There were some problems with the elevators during my stay - the card readers weren't working. The staff seemed clueless as to how to deal with the problem, and guests had to tell them what to do (i.e. send the elevator away from the lobby, and then put it out of service, so that the other elevator would accept calls to the lobby).A few other problems - my room AC wasn't working on the last evening, which made the room uncomfortably hot. Also, when I checked in I noticed that the pack of M&M's on the mini bar had been torn open (perhaps by the previous guest?). Nevertheless, they weren't replaced during my stay, and my credit card was charged $4.50 after I left (I'm guessing for this item).I'd like to say I'd enjoyed my second stay as much as the first, but that wasn't the case.

So I moved to another hotel.The next day they tested the room and claimed that they found no bedbugs but did find a mosquito. As a result they would not refund my stay.

The room was just perfect. 12th floor, no view except of neighboring buildings, but didn't matter at all. The windows open for actual fresh (by NYC standards) air which was lovely in addition to excellent A/C. Clean and well laid out room (not cramped) with a stellar king bed, and excellent pillows and bedding. Some have said the frosted bathroom door was an issue, but I'm not sure how that could be anything but simply a cool feature. There is a curtain that pulls across so if someone is sleeping, you can pull the curtain across as you are going into the bathroom. So easy and brilliant. All finishes and furniture were classics and in perfect repair, and the huge smart TV was sweet to watch after a long day of touring the city. We requested a Keurig beforehand, and they provided pods as well. Piece of cake. If you check in fri/sat/sun there is Prosecco chilling at the front desk. Staff are young and keen and extremely helpful. We didn't eat at the hotel, but the bar had a beautiful, cozy and convivial atmosphere. Fulton St. Subway is a 4 min walk, and many amenities right beside/nearby. We often stopped into Jubilee market a block over for some fruit or bagels etc...All in all, a really special place, that had welcoming staff, quiet rooms and although downtown (so not central to Manhattan), every event/location we went to was basically on 1 subway line (ie, Yankee stadium/ Times Square etc)...so very little need to transfer and completely worth travelling the extra 5 mins downtown to come ""home"" to the hotel. It is our go-to from this point on, hands down.

This trip, myself, wife and two daughters were spending a long weekend in NYC for my daughters birthday. We arrived at JFK and took a limo to Manhattan. Upon turning down Platt st, you notice that the road in narrow and dark. Ahead on the right are the flags in front of the hotel. Now we hadn't been to NYC in quite a while so initially, we were nervous. We couldn't have been more wrong. A gentleman greeted us at the door and helped us with our bags. The check in process was great and the two gentleman behind the counter were polite, receptive and courteous. Upon getting to our room, we noticed that there was no crib and roll away bed for my kids. We placed our bags down and headed back out to find food. Upon returning to the lobby, the gentleman we checked in with greeted me by my last name (very professional and great attention to detail in my opinion). We spoke to them about the crib and roll away. They told us that the room we were in was to small to accommodate that so they moved us to a king deluxe room at no charge and provided us with the beds needed. This was just the groundwork of how amazing their customer service is. I say that in the present tense because I believe this is how they treat all of their guest. Upon returning back from dinner, we received our new room keys and proceeded to the new room where we were greeted by all our bags, fresh fruit and a bottle of wine. The room was beautifully decorated with at least 16 foot ceilings. The bathroom was very well lit and the shower had water pressure that could literally strip the rust off the hull of a ship (HUGE PLUS in my book). Prior to arriving, I spoke to the manager via Email regarding our upcoming trip and explained how this was for my daughters birthday. On Sunday (her actual birthday) we arrived back at the hotel and on the table we found more fresh fruit and a box addressed to my daughter. They had given her a box of amazing cookies as a small gift. Another thing I noticed is the first night, I went to the restaurant in the lobby area for a drink. Upon exiting the elevator, a new worker had greeted me once again by my last name. This attention to detail and professionalism is amazing. One last thing for this review. This hotel was absolutely affordable.

The location was not where we usually stay but were very impressed with the location with lots to see around the area: Brooklyn bridge, South Seaport, World Trade Center, New York Stock Exchange and one of my favourite stores, Century 21. The Fulton subway station was also very close and we never had trouble getting a cab (though not directly out front of the hotel) but a minute walk away. The area was really quiet on the weekend which was perfect for us and during the week was quite busy but went back to quiet at night. We ended up really enjoying the location.The hotel itself was nice - the rooms were a bit dark but I don't think you can really expect a room with a view in NYC. We stayed in the King Deluxe room and were happy with the size. Plenty of closet space, the bathroom was a good size and the bed was very comfy. The decor in the room was great as well. It's also great to have wifi included as we usually pay about $20 for wifi a day at other hotels. We were really only in our room to sleep but were happy with it.The only compliant about the hotel is that I saw on instagram that the hotel has bikes that they lend out, however when we were there the bikes were out for repair.

The Gild Hall met all my requirements and then some!So what were my requirements:1. Not a Holiday Inn/Days Inn/Motel 8, etc. Those hotels are great when you are on roadtrips but not when you're in a city like NYC. And I accept that may sound snobbish, but unless you are a frequent traveler to NYC, why not treat yourself with something different?2. Walking distance to subways. This hotel is about three blocks away from the Fulton stop which has four or five different subway lines...including the A line which dumps you at JFK. 3. Food options. I am vegan and there is a great vegan local fast food spot on Maiden Lane (Terri's). Next to Terri's was a Chipotle, Dunkin Donuts, Salad Shop, Sandwich shop, Mexican Restaurant, 2 Irish bars/restaurants, an Italian restaurant (not including Felice's which is housed in the hotel) Starbucks, etc.. Maiden Lane is a block south. 4. Price. New York is tricky and I knew I would be spending more if I wanted to meet requirement 1. I got an amazing deal on Gild Hall's website and when the price dropped, they offered the price drop. If that isn't service! Not too many requirements, right?So, I met my girlfriend at Gild Hall and loved the decor. A bit masculine but in a nice way with book lined shelves, leather chairs, an antler chandelier. The staff was incredibly friendly and check in was a breeze. They actually let you check in the day before online, with any preferences you may want. So the (my) perfect room was waiting for me. The room was large and well planned out. There was a built-in book case, small closet, built in mini/bar fridge. Massive bed and chair, high ceilings and really looks just like the pictures. The bathroom was well lit and clean. My view was of the building across the street, but I wasn't staying there for a fantastic view. Only downside, my TV seemed to be on the fritz, it took ages to change the channel and then it would start going on its own. Since I turned the TV on once, while getting ready, it wasn't a deal breaker for me. Felice's bar and restaurant which is next to the lobby was a wonderful place for a drink and snack. They close at midnight, but the library bar upstairs is open to 3. This was helpful as I didn't get in until almost 11 pm and NYC is the city that never sleeps, right?The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and overall wonderful. Everyone there would say hello and with a smile, ask if we needed anything, it was wonderful. Overall, I was incredibly impressed and they deserve the reviews they receive.",,mariamO2511KS,9,5.0

This was 100% the right decision! The hotel is situated on a very quiet street which was perfect for us, as after our action packed days we needed to get our heads down to catch up on some much needed sleep (I had requested a high room which they granted - the room was on the top floor). One other point which is very important, the hotel is located just a few minutes walk from Fulton Street station which has many different connections to the different boroughs in New York, plus a direct train to Howard Beach and Jamaica station's which means you can then catch the Airtrain directly to JFK which both my partner and I did - all in all it's approximately an hour from airport to hotel. On to the room now, the room had all the amenities that we needed (hairdryer, iron, mini fridge etc) and a huge, comfortable queen size bed! The only issue with the mini bar, is that the items were incredibly pricey for what they were - but there are numerous supermarkets close by where you can get juices, waters etc at a fraction of the price. However, the best part of the hotel without a doubt is the service/staff who worked there. When we arrived, we were asked how our journey was and then were walked over to the bar and given a welcome drink. Every morning the staff took the time and effort to ask what we were doing during the day (and had a genuine interest, weren't just making small talk). If we needed any advice, such as what trains to catch or places to eat the staff would take the time and effort to assist you. Before we even left for our holiday, I had emailed the manager of the hotel and told him I was intending to purpose to my fiancee (she said yes), where he made a note on the system and said speak with one of the team when you know the day and we will sort something out. So, I spoke with the team on the morning of the proposal and gave them a rough time when we would be returning and returned to a complimentary bottle of Prosecco, a trio of deserts (which they had gone out and purchased from the bakery from down the road) and had put some rose petals out over the floor in a heart shape to welcome us back. Brilliant effort! All in all, a brilliant hotel in fantastic location which is substantially quieter from anywhere in Midtown at a very competitive price.

Obviously wonderful for business given that the hotel's situated near Wall Street, the location was also good tourists, especially those who may want a quiet night of sleep during weekend visits without sacrificing too much for convenience (just a few minutes' walk to Fulton).Special mentions need to go to the staff. I was actually there for a professional examination. Upon mentioning that when I arrived, I received an envelope under the door the next morning with a ""Good Luck"" note and a Starbucks gift card - a touching sentiment especially when travelling alone. Housekeeping was also very prompt with changing out and replacing amenities. On a related note, the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in among all hotels I've stayed in. You can imagine how welcoming a feeling that was after a 20-hour trip.The only minor shortcoming was the fire alarm - it blared several times the second day I was there for testing, the first one being very early in the morning. Thankfully I was jet lagged and awake by then, but I can imagine that causing quite a scare with the rest of the residents.Overall a fantastic experience.

The hotel was decorated very nicely and we really loved the spaciousness of our room. The see through bathroom door was a bit odd, and we didn't notice the curtain until the last day, unfortunately!On the second day of our stay, we went out to explore the city very early in the day and only returned to the hotel close to midnight. We were not informed upon check-in the first day, that the water would be TURNED OFF from 11 pm to 7 am on our second day of stay at the hotel. We were not given notice at all regarding this loss of water, so we could not prepare for the day accordingly. Upon calling reception and learning of this water outage, we were disappointed that we were not initially informed and the response of the hotel. Upon learning of this water outage, my husband went downstairs to talk to reception and was told that if I wanted to take a shower, I would have to go downstairs to get a key to the 2nd/3rd floor as those floors still had water. When being escorted to the 2nd floor, the staff member was half-halfheartedly apologizing for the inconvenience and when I was responding, I was told to stop talking as guests were sleeping, which I found to be pretty condescending. I took a shower and returned the key. I then called reception again as we had to use the restroom and we had no water to flush the toilet. i was told that the 2nd and 3rd floor would have water all night so they allowed me to keep the key for a suite on the 2nd floor in order to go to the restroom. Turns out, the water stopped working on these two floors as well! We were told twice that we would get a discount on our stay at the hotel due to our inconvenience and the hotel forgetting to inform us of this water outage, however, they did not follow up with us regarding this matter at all during our stay, or upon check-out. Instead, we were given a box of baked goods from Felice and a note from the manager saying he was sorry. If we were initially told that we were going to get a discount on having no water for the night, then I really don't think the hotel should have substituted this discount with a couple of baked treats. For the rest of our stay, the staff were cold to us and did not speak to us. I've never experienced this at a hotel before. If they had notified us about the water outage in the first place, then we wouldn't have been so outraged. We paid good money for the hotel and wanted to enjoy our vacation, and shouldn't have had to worry about lack of water in the hotel. If the hotel was nicer in their response, then I could have let it go, but at this point in time, even though the hotel was comfortable and in a convenient location, I don't think I could ever return.","Toronto, Canada","meenakj</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",0,2.0

After mentioning it was our 35th anniversary we were welcomed with a bottle of wine delivered to our room, which we enjoyed. The hotel is small to medium in scale, so there are no sky scraper rooms with a big view. The rooms are comfortable with a muted feel, with dark woodwork and blends of medium browns, saddle brown leather bed headboard, and white, gray wall tiles and brown marble floor worked into the décor. This gives the room a modern, masculine look. The location probably bustles during the week when the financial district is in full swing. On a holiday weekend it was relatively quiet around the hotel with only a few restaurants to walk to. The subway was a short walk away, so our theater and museum trips were easy to start and finish. The One World Trade Tower and memorial fountains were an easy walk.","Gorham, Maine","Jim G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gorham, Maine</strong>",3,4.0

Very good service and pretty characterful, if a little gloomy. But the noise!! It's directly opposite a vast underground car garage extractor fan that blasts out sound waves 24/7. The feeble double glazing in the windows does nothing to stop this sound assault. My advice - get a room at least on the 6th floor idle higher. My wife also had the ice machine in the corridor to contend with - what is it with you Americans and ice that you would put a machine that sounds like an industrial meat grinder outside the door of a hotel bedroom. Hotels are designed as places to SLEEP not consume ice!! If you aren't sensitive to noise (or you are stone dead) this place is fine. Centrally located, reasonable size rooms, good showers, nice breakfast (if pricey) and comfortable beds. No curtains only blinds and no tea or coffee in the room.

We had some problems with the thermostat in our room which the engineer quickly fixed for us. Unfortunately, the thermostat didn't work again when we got back to the room at 3am.

Gild Hall is located in downtown New York City, near Wall Street and the World Trade Center memorial but far from most tourist attractions, such as Broadway, museums, etc. It is also near the Seaport area. Per other reviews, Gild Hall was recently completely renovated from its former life as a Holiday Inn. Pluses:1. Responsive, courteous front desk staff and housekeeping dept.;2. Excellent breakfasts at Felice, the restaurant in the hotel. We did not eat lunch or dinner there since the menu is limited to Italian food and the prices are fairly high, although not out of line for New York City;3 If you like decorator design rooms, you get them here;4. Bathrooms are modern with in-tub showers with plenty of hot water and good pressure;5. Free New York Times and Wall Street Journals available at Front Desk;6. In the same block are same day dry cleaning and laundry, a convenience store for magazines, candy, and soft drinks; and Starbucks, as well as a Blue Cup coffee store.A short distance away is a Duane Reed by Walgreens Drug Store and a small Gristede's grocery store, as well as some other informal restaurants & fast food, including Zeytuna, which has a sort of food court. Also some ATMs, a hardware store, etc.7. Large screen TV in room but no channel guide information on the cable system and missing premium channels, like HBO.8. Comfortable beds;9. Effective and quiet air conditioning;10. We did not hear any noise coming from other rooms and although we were opposite the elevators, we heard no noise from them.11. A good happy hour in the bar upstairs from the lobby - we did not attend.Minuses:1. No store in hotel so one must go out to buy soft drinks, water, etc.2. The designers of the rooms did not think it necessary to include an alarm clock or dressers to put your clothes in. 3. All rooms have only three feet of closet space, not enough to hang up clothes for a couple. Only the more expensive rooms add about three feet of open shelving. We had the hotel set up a small clothes rack in the room and it helped a lot.4. The bathroom has some glass shelves for your bathroom (shaving, makeup, etc.) items but the sinks do not have counter space surrounding them. You need instructions to work the in-tub showers, one handle is for temperature only and one is for volume of water.5. Many rooms have no view other than the office building next to the hotel.6. $9 bottle of water in the room and no water is sold in the hotel - so go to the convenience store near the hotel and buy water at normal prices. 7. One taxi from Midtown could not find the hotel (this driver did not know how to use his GPS) - suggest you ask to driver to go to Gold Street in Downtown (not the Gold Street in Brooklyn) rather than giving the name of the hotel or street address.;8. A business center where you have to pay for over 5 minutes of computer use, although you can print your boarding pass for free;9. So - so wi-fi- free but it doesn't always work and if you want to stream video you need to pay for premium wi-fi 10. Like many hotels, only two elevators, so on the one day that one was out of service, long waits for the elevator. in a good location for businesWall Street area (called fidi - financial district) or if you especially want to be near the Seaport area.

It is a decent hotel located near the Federal Courthouse and in the financial district. Plenty of good reasonably priced restaurants nearby and the staff was always warm and friendly. The price was also decent considering it is New York and the room size and bathroom size were good. I had a room on the 10th floor right by the elevator. To be fair they asked if I wanted a room higher up or away from the elevator and I choose poorly. The elevator rattles all day and all night so it wasn't just the dingy from people on my floor getting on and off. However, the excessively loud air conditioner did an adequate job of drowning out the elevator noise and sort of sounded like a white noise machine (only louder) at night. The room was stylish as was the bathroom where the shower had excellent water pressure. There was no top sheet on my bed and I am not sure if this is standard or just happened. Hope they change the duvet cover after each guest. The room was very clean so I wasn't concerned. The Wifi worked well. There wasn't a coffee maker in the room which would have been nice.

I usually stay on the Upper East side, but business was down town on this 2 night trip.The lobby is especially fun. Being asked, ""may I offer you a glass of Prosecco as you check in"" was a telling sign that this would be a fine stay. The basic room was kind of a sophisticated funky with a comfortable bed. Not much shelf space in the bathroom (almost none), but the shower was good and strong and birght because of all the glass and classic fixtures.The room is well lit and functional. My only complaint (which I told them) is the lack of free coffee in the morning. Kimpton and other like hotels always have coffee you can grab and bring back to the room while dressing (or grab on your way our). The Gild makes you order it from the bar. This means $4.5 dollars and precious morning time lost.

Whilst there were several positives to be attributed to the hotel, overall the hotel did not meet expectations.To begin with the positives; the hotel is in a good location for the Financial District, within walking distance of Wall Street and close to several subway stations that provide easy access to the city. The hotel itself is on a quiet street by NY standard and i did not experience excessive outside noise whilst staying here. Check-in staff were pleasant and able to answer several questions regarding the area and local transport links knowledgeably. Unfortunately, on arrival to my room things took a turn for the worse.The first room I was allocated was on the second floor, seperated from the hotels restaurant/bar by only a few feet. The noise from the bar was significant and I was informed that it would be finished by 11.30pm; 2 hours later the noise was still preventing any chance of sleep and I was told i could be moved to another floor the next day as they were fully booked that night. Granted this was a Saturday night, however over the course of my one week stay i often returned late in the evening to find the bar still open so i recommend those travelling on business to request a room on a higher floor.The next day i was transferred to a room on the 15th floor which was very quiet and to their credit the staff handled this well.The room itself was well decorated throughout with a King size bed and large tv with many channels. The bathroom was spacious clean and the shower provided warm high pressure water. I personally found the room quite dark with little lighting available and whilst this style may suit couples for solo travellers it was not ideal.Unfortunately, despite there being snow on the ground outside the hotel had no heat available throughout the buiilding. This resulted in the hotel being far too cold to be comfortable for the first three nights of my stay. The hotel staff made no mention of this and I was not informed until I asked that there was even an issue . For the price paid It is expected to be able to be to have some heating provided or at least informed of the issue before returning late to a cold room!On raising this to the staff i was offered a space heater which thankfully provided some respite although not enough to warm the room to an adaquete standard. To add insult to injury, on checkout I was told I had incurred a $9 charge for a bottle of water! This is despite being informed on the first day that water was complementary, as in the norm in hotels of this calibre I have previously stayed at. I was then told whilst it can be provided in the same bottles free with reception, in the room in incurs this frankly ridiculous price. I would have thought a bottle of water would have been the minimum they could waive for three days without heat! Overall whilst I feel I was unfortunate with my staff here compared to other reviews, for my personal stay it simply was not good enouugh.

For the most part, a lot of the reviews are accurate. Rooms are great and styled funkily. Reception is attentive. Lobby and bar/restaurant are lively.I chose the hotel because I wanted to get away from the standard and boring hotels of mid-town. You know which hotels I'm referring to: National brands with standardized accommodations and service.From that perspective, Gild Hall exceeded my expectations. There's nothing boring! At every turn, I found myself intrigued. From the artwork in the hallways to the decor in the lobby. It grabs your attention and makes you look.The room is also meets this criteria. It's decor is eye-catching and the accommodations are comfortable.I uploaded a bunch of pictures, take a look.I rated Gild Hall as 4-stars (very good). I would have given 5-stars, but there was significant construction at the hotel during my stay in early March 2016. This led to long waits for the elevator and a significant slow-down of traffic at the hotel entrance (dumpster blocking road). Uber's and taxis were taking forever.I'll definitely stay at Gild Hall again. I'd expect once the construction is complete, it will be a 5-star experience. I love Thompson hotels!","Boston, Massachusetts","belvie1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",32,4.0

There is an obscene amount of construction going on around my building in NY and I thought this could perhaps function as a second home when it became too unbearable. Unfortunately, the glitter of it all ends after the lobby. When I book a 4/5 star hotel - I expect the basic amenities to be something I don't think about, a given. In other words, the last thing I want to worry about at a luxury hotel is the AC/water pressure/lighting. The AC simply didn't work, was loud, and the room remained at nearly 80 degrees the whole night. When it chose to turn on from its mandated Eco setting, it was loud and emanated warm air. I was uncomfortable and kept up the entire night. While the shower has amazing pressure, the temp oscillated by itself from the temp I chose to scalding me intermittently on its own. Needless to say, I had to forgo spending any more time than I needed to in there. The hot water was jarring. I ordered room service as soon as I checked in and specially asked that they make sure there is no pork at all near my food, Lo and behold - a cold burger arrives smothered in Pancetta. They were nice enough and corrected the burger after I called and apologized. Now...what really annoyed me about this experience is that I asked the attendant when signing for the food whether his tip was already included (I was a bit confused bc there were two service charges, a flat $5 charge and another $9 service charge) He told me - ""no, none of that is my tip - it's for the hotel"" so I gave him a $10 tip. I don't know if he was lying or not...but either way - a $5 charge, 18% hotel service charge, and then having to tip another 20% is just insane. Nearly 25 dollars in service for a hamburger that was done incorrectly and dish of pasta. Now, onto the lighting. It is depressing. Even in the morning...it is just so dark and gloomy. There is a difference between an avant-garde, gothic chic feel and just terrible and depressing lighting. Truly, if only one of these things were amiss - I would have not even noticed...but to have all of them be poor experiences was just too much. I went down to complain to the front desk and while the young gentleman was nice enough, and he was - he seemed like a deer in the headlights dealing with a complaint. He offered me free breakfast which I politely declined...I wanted a place to sleep...I was not here to rack up freebies. I asked him if I could please just checkout because I needed to find a new hotel now. He asked if he could send an engineer to check the AC and other things...truly not a satisfactory solution - an appropriate one would have been - let me find you a new room where you won't have any problems. The last thing I want is to sit in my room after a night of no sleep to have someone come fix things...that only adds more to my discomfort. He pulled up my bill, said - ok, I will take care of the room service. I said ok. We left it at that. Gild Hall, I really really really wanted to like you. Alas, I will have to stay at more traditional albeit more reliable options during my NY Staycation.

My husband had done extensive research and booked Gild Hall knowing that I love fun boutique hotels. Unfortunately, there were many more drawbacks to staying at Gild Hall than we had anticipated.Pros:- Friendly staff, very clean rooms- One of the best showers I've ever had in my life. The water pressure is like a fire hose.- Nice linens, comfortable bed- Spacious rooms for NYC standards with high, beautiful ceilings- Mad Men style decor - Delicious food at Felice, and complimentary breakfast was a lovely touchCons:- NO HEAT. In NYC. In March. When we let the front desk know that we didn't have heat, we were told ""Oh, we turned off the heat for the whole building because it's so warm out. We can send you a space heater, though."" So warm out? The days we were there it was in the 50s, 40s and 30s respectively, and on the final day a snowstorm rolled in. We are from Boston and we were freezing. To us it seemed like a coverup for the heat simply not working. It was also uncomfortably cold in the lobby and restaurant. - The lights in our room stopped working twice. It was fixed quickly, but come on!- The neighborhood is far from most tourist destinations aside from the World Trade Center memorial and Staten Island Ferry. If your goal is to see most NYC tour destinations you will spend a lot of time on the Subway or a lot of money in taxis/Uber.- Construction on the street. At 7 months pregnant I was hoping for a peaceful getaway and a chance to sleep in. Unfortunately they chose to put us in a room overlooking jackhammer construction that began early in the morning. I wish they had put us in a room further away.- Terrible wifi. We had to disconnect from it in order to use our phones properly.- One elevator was broken for the length of our stay and we often had to wait 5+ minutes to go up or down to our room, plus share the elevator with stinky trash bins.The bottom line is that our stay was fine, if a bit disappointing. I will not be staying here again as heat and electricity are things I require when spending hundreds of dollars on a hotel room. There are so many great places to stay in NYC, I will be giving them my money in the future.","Boston, Massachusetts","Mary_Elizabeth13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",1,3.0

The area around the hotel has numerous bars and restaurants and especially at night, was much quieter.I emailed the hotel in advance and asked for a quiet room if possible and that is exactly what we got, thank you. They also acknowledged the fact that the trip was the start of celebrations for my husband's 60th birthday, which was a lovely touch. The room was on the 17th floor and when I woke during the night there was no noise either from the street or other guests in the hotel, which meant I slept well on all 3 nights, in what was a comfortable, huge bed.The room, although not particularly large was tastefully decorated with good quality linen, towels and a bathrobe. A little dark but that is due to the décor and the fact that you are surrounded by other buildings, but that is New York.We had dinner in the Felice restaurant on one occasion, which was without a doubt the best meal of our trip. The restaurant was busy, but the service and attention was spot on and both my husband and myself said that it was the best steak we had eaten in a very long time. Breakfast was included in our deal, either the American or Continental, both of which were excellent and set us up for the day ahead.The greatest asset to this hotel though has to be the staff that work here. Every person we spoke to was polite, friendly and extremely helpful, special thanks must go to Violet on reception, who was particularly helpful. This hotel would definitely be my first choice when we return to New York and I would have no hesitation in recommending it to others.","Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom","nixonmichael</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom</strong>",11,5.0

The Financial District has quite a good selection of bars and restaurants, the nicer ones tending to be around the Seaport area.

My gf and I wanted to do something special for our 1 yr dating anniversary so we decided to ditch our crappy BK apt and stay at a swanky hotel and have a fun, crazy, night out. Well usually my gf (an event planner) handles such arrangements, but I wanted to show her that I have booking skills too, so I took on the task of arranging the evening. I found this awesome deal on a another website and and Gild Hall looked awesome so I booked it! Oh, there's one little thing I forgot to add: I had this crazy idea to propose to my gf at some point in the evening!Not knowing if they would even care, I contacted the hotel and let them know what my plan was for the evening. Jonathon, David, and the rest of the team sprung into action! They immediately offered me a room upgrade (granted, this was already a possibility in the package deal I purchased, but it was by no means guaranteed), and an amenity to be sent to the room once we arrived. All this to make the night feel even more special! And perhaps more importantly it really impressed Ms Event Planner who is extra picky about where she stays...David even contacted me personally when there appeared to be a problem with my booking to make sure we didn't show up and have a nasty surprise! Who does that?! Well thank god he did, because I had indeed messed up. Totally saved my backside.Needless to say, the evening was magical!

My husbans and I were celebrating christmas for the first time alone in a hotel, and I had requested some help with making the room full of christmas spirit. I had orded some packages online and had them delivered to the hotel. The staff at Gild Hall had unwrapped the packages and put up some christmas lights, stockings, filled the stockings with candy and even went out and bought several bottles of christmas beer. It was totally awesome! We had a room in the 15th floor. The soaps provided for shower were amazing! First time that the hotel shampoo and conditioner smelled so good that I want to take it home! The free wifi worked well with two devices. The mini bar is well stocked with a lot of items I have not seen before. The bed was the most comfortable I have ever had, the pillows amazing, lovely duvet and such soft and pleasant covers. The only downside to the room was the noise from the aircon/heating.

We have been searching for something in a quiet location, easy to get to, nice sized rooms, and good value. We finally found a hotel to which we can safely say will be our go-to hotel from here on out. The Gild Hall is an excellent hotel. The lobby is very warm and inviting. It is so nice to walk into on a cold day! And with the hotel bar/restaurant just to the left, there is always the option for a hot or cold beverage. Upon entering we were greeted warmly by the front desk. Unfortunately we were a bit early for check in, so we left our luggage and went to explore the area. We were supposed to get a text message when our room was ready, but we never received it. That and a little confusion at check in about our requested upgrade were the only two slip ups by the staff. After lunch and shopping we returned to find our room ready. We stayed in a King Suite and I would definitely choose this option again. There is a small bar/kitchen area fully stocked with everything to get a good party started. It is probably the first time I have ever encountered a cocktail shaker and every type of cocktail glass imaginable as standard fare in a hotel! The sitting room is a VERY nice size with a great flat screen tv. The leather couch was very comfortable and a much needed refuge after all the walking we had just done. The bathroom for our suite was very nice. However it is awkwardly connected to the sitting room and not the bedroom. Not a big deal, but make sure you clear a path from the bedroom to the bathroom so you do not trip over something during the middle of the night. The bathroom was a nice size with a great tile shower. Lighting is good and space is adequate for anything you need to store. The bedroom was again a very nice size. The king size bed was firm but comfortable. The linens and pillows were excellent. On the wall opposite the bed hung another 40+ inch flat screen tv. (I almost convinced my wife that was what we needed in our bedroom at home, but I don't think I won that argument.) Oh, did I mention the very tall ceilings in the bedroom and sitting rooms? It definitively made the already large rooms feel that much bigger. We were celebrating a very special event that we have celebrated at a couple of other hotels in NYC. I always let the staff know as it is an important life event for my wife and I to celebrate. I have to say the Gild Hall staff went all out and I thank them for all that they did. It definitely made for a special stay. We will 100% be back to the Gild Hall for our next city get away. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet place to stay, excellent service, clean rooms, and a large floorplan. Keep up the good work Gild Hall! We will be back soon!","Stamford, Connecticut","michael95u</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stamford, Connecticut</strong>",84,5.0

Gild Hall turned out to be much cheaper than airport hotels or other hotels in manhattan, and it seemed to be ranked very highly, so we decided to book it. We're glad that we did, because our stay there was great. As we arrived, the front desk informed us we got a complimentary upgrade to a better room which was really nice after spending a day stuck at the airport. The room was lovely, with plenty of space and a comfy bed. There's free wi-fi in the room and the speed was quite good, however it is free only for two devices.

Furthermore, the bathroom door is corrugated glass, so your partner or whomever you're with can easily see you, leaving little to the imagination. It's highly awkward.Overall, it's a beautiful hotel, but you're certainly paying for it. Two nights set me back about $900 on a Saturday Sunday. I recommend it if you don't mind the cost. But with the cost in mind, I can't say I honestly found it to be worth it. Nonetheless, nothing notably wrong with the place either (other than the bathroom door situation).

Had sunflower toast for the first time and now I want to find it a the store. We also had lunch one day at Felice which was also delicious. The location is truly tucked away and you feel like you are in a neighborhood. Great grocery stores near but. Five minute walk to the 911 Museum (be sure to book tickets ahead of time).

The Prosecco glass upon arrival was a nice touch, but that is where the positive ends. When we got into the room we noticed a very heavy cigarette smoke smell. I was firstly worried that we would be charged for smoking in the room so we decided to tell the front desk. It was everywhere, in the bathroom, in the towels, sheets and the blanket. When leaving for dinner, I spoke with the front desk and his reaction was ""Can I go to your room to see?"" Well, I suppose, but that's strange. If I say it smells, then it does. After coming back he had said he sprayed deodorizer and that it was 'all better'. I realized that night when taking a shower that it was coming from the vent in the shower. I called downstairs again and we were told that we would be moved the next day. Next day comes around and we were promised an 'upgrade' and to the 14th floor but just 5 minutes later we were told that we would be on the 18th floor. While being escorted to our new room, the bellman informed me that the cigarette smoke is from the neighbors and it was a well known problem. WHY did the front desk request to go to my room to smell said aroma? Why not just move us? Unfortunately, when we walked in it was the exact same room. No upgrade because they evidently didn't have one to give.

Glass doors into the bathroom leave little to imagination. In a word, dreary. I understand Thompson group bought this property from Holiday Inn about 8 years ago but they have not done much with the interior of the hotel. Shabby is another word that comes to mind. At $320 per night plus tax I prefer anything but shabby.Cheap pillows, thin towels, did I mention the black carpet? Positives, huge TV in the room, nice front desk staff. No bellboy. Restaurant Felicity was ok for breakfast.We were in NYC last time back in 2011 and stayed at Sofitel which I loved. This time Sofitel has gone off the deep end and wanted to charge $750 for the room so we ended up at Gild. In retrospect I should have spent a hundred dollars more per night and stayed at Ritz Carlton Battery Park.Hotel is ranked very high on Trip Advisor (38 out of 1400 NYC hotels) but I believe this to be misleading at the very least and I can think of at least a hundred better hotels in New York City. Stay away.","Houston, Texas","Jason M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",67,2.0

Half of our friends stayed at the hotel and the others stayed else where yet we all ended up spending our time here. The decor of the hotel is fantastic and it even has an amazing smell that you get no matter what part of the hotel your in. The bar has a great selection of alcohol and mix cocktail drinks. The only thing we didn't try was the hotel restaurant which we will next time. Checking in was really easy as we were able to check in ahead of time and pick our preference for a room (quiet, high floor, etc). One of our friends who came early was able to have early check in (around 12:30pm) which was amazing that they were able to accommodate for her like that. That's something we typically don't experience with other hotels. The actual rooms are really nice and are a typical size for NY. It has a huge flat screen and the beds are extremely comfortable. The only downside that we saw was the bathroom. The actual bathroom is nice but the doors, like other reviewers have said, leaves little to the imagination. The shower is small as well, in the rooms with the standard tub/showers. The shower head was probably one of the worst I've had in a hotel. It was old so it just pointed down and the pressure was really screwy. I hope that in the regular rooms that they would upgrade at least the shower head. All in all we definitely want to make this our go to hotel for when we're in NYC. It has a great value and its on par with hotels that aren't as nice as it. One more thing to note is because we were in town to get married we had mentioned it to the hotel. After we had checked in and left to get get dinner we arrived back to a bottle of their house champagne and a nice note congratulating us. We thought that was a nice touch and they did something once again not other hotels typically do. We hope that they continue on like this because we'd love to keep coming back.

I booked online directly through Gild Hall. We stayed in the King Superior room.Pros:-Location is nice, walking distance to subway stops and nearby markets that open late. The 9/11 Memorial and World Trade Center are within walking distance.-Design of hotel and room was fantastic, and it was very clean.-Size of the room was fairly spacious, and the amenities were a nice touch (a hearty shout out to the Frette and Sferra bathrobes!). They do have a $12 Dollar Shave Club kit available for purchase, but I do wish that they had provided lower end razors for free.-I was able to check in online after receiving an email from them- super convenient! You can even communicate with them via text before you arrive.-The attached restaurant is tasty, and the complimentary breakfast we received was delicious.-I slept very well, and the room and lobby were quiet for the duration of our stay.-Free wifi for up to two devices, but it was unreliable at times. -The Business Center provided free Boarding Pass access and printing.-Management was receptive via email prior to stay.-The Front Desk held our luggage after check out, so that we could roam the city for a few hours before our flights.Cons:-The location is a bit confusing, and made it hard for cabs to find us when we called them to the hotel.-We noticed the first night that the thermostat was not working, and we were very cold the first evening/morning. When I called the front desk, they sent up a technician, who informed us that the heating for the entire building was not working, and would not be working for a while because they hadn't turned it on. They provided an extra blanket and a portable heater instead, but I don't believe the heating was turned on for the entire duration of our stay. The shower also had erratic heating, and would get extremely hot and random times.-Management told me that they would provide breakfast for us for every morning of our stay, but when we arrived, we only received vouchers for one morning.-The hotel was aware that we were traveling to commemorate a special occasion, but we didn't receive champagne like others traveling to celebrate, nor did we receive any upgrades (even though the hotel seemed fairly empty). All in all, I'd stay at Gild Hall again if we see a good deal online. I'd probably opt for a nicer room to get the full experience.

I finished my second stay at Gild this summer, a little over 3 weeks at the hotel, and since then I've been trying to come up with words that can adequately describe the efforts of everyone at Gild to a person reading Trip Advisor.A bit about me. I am a teacher and I travel quite a bit during my spare time. I pay for each trip by myself, and I wanted to make the distinction because a lot of people who travel do so on business, where their employers pay the bills. I pay my own, and choose my hotels for the experiences that they provide as much as the cities that I choose to travel to. In the past I've spent time in Jamaica, Miami, Las Vegas, Los Angeles but mostly I go to New York, where in December of 2004 I first stayed at the 60 Thompson and was introduced to the Thompson brand. This was such a great experience for me, the Thompson hotel's seem to highlight all the things that I value in a hotel. I prefer boutique hotels that are unique and each have their own personality. Locations that are in stylish areas that are convenient for nice restaurants and most importantly I appreciate staff that are genuine in how they treat you. Places where the staff are unafraid to show their own personalities and interact with the guests. These are aspects where the Thompson hotel group have always outperformed and reasons why they have earned my business in any city that they operate. I first stayed at the Gild in late December of 2014 for a New Year’s trip and even within the high degree of satisfaction that the Thompson group provides, the team at Gild had set new standards in what a boutique hotel should strive for. You can read my previous reviews within Trip Advisor but if I can highlight one particular point, I was already planning my return trip, even prior to checking out. Most travellers tend to become ""homesick"" at some points of their stay; the people at Gild are so fantastic they make me never want to leave. Leading up to the summer the Canadian dollar had plummeted and it looked like my trip was in jeopardy but Gild was very generous with me and gave me great rate to help me come back. They were so accommodating and I am so appreciative of Mr. Koster, he really valued me staying with Gild. If you have read any reviews of Gild you will read about the fantastic front desk staff. Their location within the hotel is fitting as they are the heart of Gild. You will never meet a more dedicated team of professionals. When you stay at a hotel for the time that I have you have the opportunity to see many employees work above and beyond the aspects of their job and without exaggeration David and his crew take that extra step everyday. The friendliness that Monique and Khloe put into every request is genuine. It does not matter to them if you are staying at the hotel for your tenth time or your first, every guest is the most important person and they give 100% of their attention and effort to every request. Max and Violet take a genuine interest in everyone and truly contribute far more to the hotel than their job could possibly require. And Pauline and Jessica were great too, they both really treated me well. All the front desk staff are fantastic people and I feel like they are friends. When is the last time someone at a hotel has made you feel this way?Speaking of friends, the bellman here are awesome! Being in and out of the hotel several times a day gave me plenty of contact with them and they made me feel at home. So nice to be able to talk for a few minutes with them about anything. Sports, New York, weather, these are a great group of guys who work hard for all the guests. Thanks so much to Andy, Angel, Mark and Robert. Behind the scenes the staff were just as hard working. My room was always cleaned perfectly and I was very very happy with my housekeepers. Thanks to both of them for how they took care of my room and belongings. As far as the location of hotel itself Gild is fantastic. Being in lower Manhattan you can get anywhere in the city with ease as you have virtually every subway line within a two block radius. The FiDi district is quite residential but I enjoyed the quiet area and a fun restaurant or a bar is just a quick 5 min trip on any subway. Plus i loved walking around the area and looking at all the buildings that are part of New York’s great history. But you don’t HAVE to leave the neighborhood, Stone Street is quite fun and there are a number of restaurants and bars all around the hotel, not to mention Felice within the hotel. Lots to do around the hotel too. I think One World Trade is a must see and I find the 9/11 memorial quite beautiful. The south street seaport is nice to see and great for jogging but I also really liked the Battery Park esplanade and the new restaurants in Brookfield place.The hotel itself is very stylish and really well constructed. The lobby and public spaces are very sexy and have character. The atmosphere of the hotel was perfect for me, and the music always seemed to be suited to whatever time of day it was. I like the decor of the hotel (it really suits the FiDi area), and the rooms are stylish and beautiful (and easily the largest that you will find for the price in NYC). People who value this hotel will be both stylish travelers as well as first time NYC visitors. I think it’s pretty special that a hotel can maintain such a high Trip Advisor rank with so many reviews; usually hotels that have been around for this many reviews tend to drop down a bit. What sets Gild apart from other hotels is the incredibly talented and hardworking staff. Without them, the hotel is just a cool building in a great location, and frankly there are many of these in New York. It is the combined efforts of those within the hotel which create that special environment that keeps me and others coming back. And as long as that remains intact, I will be staying at Gild whenever I am able.","Calgary, Canada","Ken R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",21,5.0

The trendy designers who thought this place up went too far with the glass door and glass wall that allows your every move (no pun intended) to be seen by your roommate. I'm sure they have a solid wall and door on their bathroom at home! We have been married for 26 years and found this design unsettling, never mind how a couple going away on a get to know you trip would handle it! In my mind nothing else maters if you are not comfortable. A great location, superior customer service, far-out whimsical trendiness all take a backseat to the basic reason one rents a room. It is to feel like you have a home away from home. When we brought up our uneasiness with the glass wall and glass door we were asked politely if we desired to have the engineer address the issue. The last thing I wanted was another person in the bathroom. The hotel attendant made it seem as if we were the only ones that like a little privacy when nature calls.Note to the trendy designers:If the rug was a lighter color all the dirt in the corners and against the walls would not show as mentioned in other reviews. I know that the manager or representative from the hotel will respond to this entry as they do with all but unless they can assure me that the bathroom walls have been boarded up in all the rooms I will not be staying at Gild Hall on my next visit.","Peabody, Massachusetts","607robertz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Peabody, Massachusetts</strong>",25,1.0

However, our room was ready and we received a warm welcome at reception. We found the staff at The Gild Hall to be pleasant and it was a real bonus to be able to put things straight into our room.The room we had was on the tenth floor and by New York standards, was spacious. There was plenty of room for us. Everything was clean, so absolutely no complaints there! Because of the hotel's location, there was no noise from the street during the night, which was another plus for us.At the weekend it is possible to get a good deal at The Gild Hall because it is in The Financial District which, as 'tourists', we didn't find to be a problem at all. The 9/11 Memorial and The Brooklyn Bridge are within easy walking distance, as are Battery Park and Hudson River Park. If you need to use the subway, that too is a short walk. Getting up to Midtown is easy. Personally, I think you get more for your money by staying at The Gild Hall rather than opting for more obvious Manhattan locations. Starbucks, a liquor store and a small grocery store are all a few minutes walk away.Very minor criticisms would be the lack of complimentary bottled water. Also, basic internet access is free but an upgrade has to be paid for. The bathroom towels could be a bit fluffier and we only had one robe in the room although, to be fair, we didn't bother to ask for a second one because I am sure if we had, it wouldn't have been a problem.I would certainly recommend The Gild Hall to friends and when we return to New York it would be somewhere that I would book again.","Mystic, Connecticut","StomWiltshire_UK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mystic, Connecticut</strong>",56,4.0

At each encounter, I found the team friendly, positive and willing to help. They smiled, inquired about satisfaction and the visit to the city. The hotel is of fantastic design, particularly the public areas that merge a bohemian vibe with the luxury of a fine gentlemen's club. The hallways are narrow, but the rooms (we had a suite) were spacious and boasted hardwood floors (a bit worn out) and masculine feeling appointments, without being too trapped by tradition. Don't expect much by way of views, however. Downtown is not the most convenient area in NYC for tourism, but the location is excellent for business and Wall Street types. The hotel is on an out-of-the-way location, but makes up for it with really great style and staff. Be warned, however, I would stay closer to midtown if I were a first time visitor looking for the typical NYC experience.

This is in lower Manhattan, so you need to want to stay in this part of the city. Personally I had never stayed in that area before and I loved it. It is quite, the river, ground zero and Brooklyn bridge are very close and the hotel is one block from the metro, so you can easily commute anywhere. The hotel itself is a great value for money. If you are looking for 5* luxury this is not the hotel for you. This is an intimate hotel with charm and character, rooms are spacious for NY standards, lobby and bar are charming, artistic details abound throughout the property and the biggest plus of the hotel is its staff, hands down the most efficient and polite service I have experienced in NY. Congratulations to the hotel management and a big thank you to all the staff at the front desk. Book the premium rooms, definitely worth the price difference, bathroom is double size. Ask for a higher floor room, quieter, more light. Also, every single item we tried in their breakfast menu was excellent! The only con I would mention is that there is a humming sound coming from the building across the street and the result is a consistent buzzing that sounds as if the aircon is constantly on. Nothing that would disturb your sleep though, just annoying. Also, due to the location of the hotel in a narrow street, no light filters in and rooms are quite dark.","New York City, New York","Anny_C17</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",49,4.0

I stayed at the hotel a few months ago for a week and had a great experience, particularly from a customer service standpoint. This time was equally as enjoyable, largely due to exceptional service from front desk associate Jessica. On two occasions, she went above and beyond to provide outstanding service. In one example, I had been feeling under the weather and hadn't slept well, asked her for an additional hour for check out, and she happily accommodated me. In another example, I was looking to extend me stay by another night, and found a cheaper rate via Hotwire, and spoke to her about it. She was able to offer me a comparable rate via the hotel, that avoided me paying the Hotwire booking fee, and allowed me to keep the same room. Jessica is a great asset to the hotel and her work ethic represents the brand well. ",,RCTMiami,6,5.0

This is a review for a Sept/Oct 2014 stay on a business & pleasure trip.My husband and I usually spend a week, twice to three times a year in NYC and on this trip, we had been to another hotel for 5 days. Though this hotel was decent, my husband said ""let's get out of here"" and go back to the Gild Hall for three days! So we took a cab and swapped hotels!the positives:- Amazingly comfortable king-size bed (firm). If you travel a lot and for a long period of time, this is where your search starts and almost ends! -Super quiet rooms, quiet floors, on a quiet street, in a quieter neighbourhood at night. More zzzz!- Huge room. Lots of space to open suitcases and move around (great if you're a couple).- All the usual amenities in the room (minibar, tv, desk, etc..) and stylish décor (modern version of an English library look)-Professional, friendly and helpful staff and service.-Starbucks (no surprise there!) round the corner, Century 21 (if you're into bargain shopping), tube stations, bars & restaurants, etcthe negatives:- the view of the room is the other building across the street so the rooms are on the darker side (this is however true about a lot of NYC hotels)- If you need the bathroom at night, don't switch the lights on, you'll wake everyone up! There is some sort of ""frosted glass"" (not see through but it lets the light come through unfortunately). Get a plug-in night light or use your phone!+ or -: -Please note that this is more of a small luxury/boutique hotel. I see this as a positive (the lift is there when you need it!) and it is a quiet. There is however a lively and very stylish bar in the hotel as well as a restaurant I think (we did not go to the restaurant so I cannot comment on it).-It is also situated in the Financial District so it will be hectic during the day but dead quiet at the weekend (and very quiet at night).This is an outstanding hotel.

I also got ready for my wedding in my room (a King Suite) with my bridal party.I can't say enough about how pleased I was with the experience! Gild Hall was absolutely perfect for all of our many needs during the weekend and I did not want to leave! The King Suite was beautiful and had so many unique and interesting details in the decor that didn't make it feel like a typical, standard hotel. It was also very spacious - it had a very large bathroom, a small kitchen (that was enough for a couple people to stand in at once, and had a mini fridge, microwave, Keurig, sink, and counter space), a large living room, and a separate bedroom. For much of the morning, there were 13 people in the suite (between bridal party, family, hair/makeup, photographer, assistants, etc.) and while it didn't feel enormous, it definitely never felt too crowded.The hotel lobby is beautiful and was a great setting for my bridal portraits. We never tried the bar or restaurant, so I can't comment on that, but it did seem that people were always at the bar.The staff at the hotel were wonderful and they really made our stay great. They were so accommodating with people coming and going constantly and things like finding and delivering an additional full-length mirror and accommodating a late check-out so we could attend our post-wedding brunch before having to check out. They were very helpful with bags and luggage, as we had a lot. In particular, David at the front desk was great but every employee we encountered was very nice. Our housekeeper was also amazing, as he or she managed to clean up the enormous mess left by my bridal party and me while getting ready for the wedding, and left the suite in beautiful condition for my new husband and I to return to that night.I would highly recommend Gild Hall to anyone and even though I live in NYC, I hope to have another excuse to stay here!","New York City, New York","KRB222</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",21,5.0

I have been staying exclusively with Thompson since 2004 but this was my first stay at Gild Hall. While I had known Manager Bjoern Blaha was at the hotel the FiDi neighborhood just didn’t have that draw for me that the other neighborhoods did. What a mistake on my part in so many different ways!Thompson Hotels are sexy, urban sophisticated places; and each hotel has a distinct personality that usually is inspired by the location. As one would derive from the name, Gild Hall really updates images of the Gilded age in NYC and the Financial District in a fantastic space. The lobby and bar have great character and are extremely stylish and comfortable. I found these public spaces are luxurious and when you sit down in one of the leather sofas in a private nook I am reminded of sitting in a modern, men’s club or lodge. It's a place where you feel very comfortable in relaxing while waiting or contemplating your next move. The atmosphere of the hotel with the music and lighting seems to be perfectly suited at all times and I really liked the scent of the hotel. It also seemed suited for downtown.The front desk is right to the door and this is a major advantage for Gild because their front desk staff are outstanding. Have you ever been to a hotel where the front staff are incredibly friendly and a bit over the top? Where you are treated like visiting royalty? And then come to to the desk the next day and be treated the same way, but then realize that the person had no idea that they met you the day before? That will not happen at this hotel. Within one day these people were greeting me by name, saying hello or goodbye, or just a greeting with a wave. These people were always cheerful and genuine, and did everything that they could to treat me well. In particular, James was fantastic. In all my stays at Thompson hotels, I have always been treated like a VIP and have nothing but warm things to say about this group of people who have a tough job; as they are the ones who have to deal with any complaints, and do their best to make a great first impression with every new guest. They are genuine, happy and clearly part of Thompson’s DNA. Off to the other side is a great bar spot which always had people at it. I didn’t eat at the restaurant but had several drinks at the bar, it was really the perfect spot to start the night.Upstairs the hallways are clean and the decor give you an idea of what awaits in your room. I saw a few of the rooms at Gild Hall and they are all high class, the beds are so comfortable and the quality linen's add to your comfort. The furniture and surfaces are similar to the rest of the hotel, stylish, top notch and expensive to the touch. Loved my room! The rooms are perfect and the excellent housekeeping staff maintain them very well. The housekeeping people are very courteous and are quick to deliver any extra item you may need. They certainly gave me extra chocolates and shampoo. A couple times during my stay I was contacted by someone from housekeeping to ensure that I was happy with the service, which I certainly was. I wasn’t sure what to expect of the area as for the last 5 years had been staying in Tribeca but after 2 nights I loved it in FiDi. It is much livelier than Tribeca with tons of bars and cool new spots. I was also surprised how many people lived there. This is a fantastic area and the hotel’s location is further helped by the fact that virtually every train can be accessed within a few blocks, making travel to any part of the city extremely convenient. It's such a cool neighborhood steeped in a ton of history.Gild Hotel is truly excellent in every single category that I value. I keep coming back to Thompson hotels because of the outstanding staff and of all my stays I’ve never seen such a well rounded team then the ones at Gild Hall. It really shouldn’t have been a surprise to me because Bjoern was one of the original 60 Thompson people and it’s clear that his presence has instilled all those traits that makes a Thompson hotel so special. This trip to NYC at Christmas marked 10 years that I’ve been staying with Thompson hotels and definitely was one of the best! I loved Gild Hall and can’t wait to come back!","Calgary, Canada","Ken R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",21,5.0

It is simultaneously intimate and roomy, classy modern and vintage throwback. The rooms are comfortable and quite modern in furnishings and layout without being a cookie-cutter reproduction of other hotel rooms. They are well-lit and adequately furnished with a desk for work as well. The bathrooms are particularly large and well supplied with high quality amenities. There are three separate ""fitness centers"" on three separate floors. Before you think this is overkill, it is simply that each one is quite small, with just a few pieces of cardio and weight equipment. If one is occupied, another is just a few floors away. However, in my 3-day stay I never found anyone else in them! The lobby bar/restaurant, Felice, seems to be a neighborhood gathering place and is quite lively. However, I was always able to get seated for breakfast and dinner, and the bar staff were very helpful and friendly if I just wanted to get a glass of wine. Most important, the bed was somewhat firm but very comfortable and I was not disturbed by street noise, which is a real plus for NYC. If you need a cab, give yourself a few extra minutes to do so. The doormen are happy to help, but they have to travel to a more heavily trafficked street to call one.","Arlington Heights, Illinois","Teresita_Herndon_VA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington Heights, Illinois</strong>",182,5.0

The bed was extremely comfortable, great wifi in the room , beautiful bathroom including a bathtub which is often not the case in newer boutique hotels. Nice touch by the manager of a personalized note and a bottle of complimentary water. My only reason for not giving this property 5 stars was the treatment I received by Chloe who was amanning the reception desk upon arrival.I was very specific when I checked in asking if my room was quiet as I had about 4 hours of work ahead of me----I checked in at 1015 pm and also inquired if the hotel was full ( which I was told it was not). Chloe assured me the room was quiet . I was put on the 3rd floor inn he front of the house. Needless to say the noise was nonstop all night into the morning. Chloe could not get me away from the desk quick enough and it is clear to me she knew she was not putting me in a quiet room. I am not sure if the Hotel Tonight rate was the reason for being put on a lower floor or not---- frankly as a frequent Thompson guest in other cities as well as NY (which I mentioned upon checking in) I would expect better treatment.","basking ridge, new jersey","missybrown</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>basking ridge, new jersey</strong>",101,4.0

The other throw blanket was wool, and would have also probably been too hot, as well as itchy. Perhaps a lighter blanket could be put in the closet as another option? Also, I'm not a fan of feather pillows, especially when I have to use them behind my back for support while watching TV in bed (my room didn't have an armchair), as I find they get flat and hard too easily.

At first I was skeptical. My husband and I go in and out of the city quite often and like to stay not too far from midtown. Not anymore. Gild Hall is nestled on a quiet street in the financial district. On weekends, this area is a wonderful refuge and it reminds me of the winding streets of some European cities. Gild Hall has a very European feel and a vibe that is warm and welcoming. This past weekend was our second stay and it was just as we left it in January. The staff go out of their way to welcome you, make you feel at home and make sure that everything is in order. The rooms are larger than most large chain hotel rooms. Our room was very nice and the bed was super comfortable. The bathrooms are a decent size and spotlessly clean. I asked for foam pillows and we were no sooner in our room when 4 of them arrived. The hotel is very close to several subway stops and getting around the city from there is so easy. Trust me, once you stay down in the financial district, you won't ever want to stay anywhere else-and Gild Hall is the crown jewel.The little bar off the lobby is a perfect place for before dinner drinks and a welcome site for a night cap with an espresso or cappuccino on the side.This weekend we did not venture out of the financial district. We had a fantastic dinner at Harry's on Saturday night and made the short walk to the South Street Seaport on Sunday morning where we watched the sightseeing helicopters start their day. Felice, Gild Hall's restaurant, serves a fine breakfast. We didn't eat lunch or dinner there but the menu looks wonderful.

Rasheeda Perez, is an employee of this hotel, and I must say that she personally took it upon herself to fulfill a very small request a ""dental kit""... I am not one to ever call Front Desk for anything or even complain, but her willingness to aide and ensure that I nor my Fiancé needed anything else floored me.

No one knew when it was going to be back up so I figured I might as well have a little staycation and treat myself. I arrived quite late as I tried to hold on as long as I could to see if they were going to get my power back on that night. So I walked into the Gild ready for some heat and power and definitely a drink. Anthony & Jessica took great care of me and gave me a room upgrade to help soothe their fellow Brooklynite. Yay!! They totally didn't have to do that but it was such a kind thing to do. I asked about the bar and it was just about to close but they said they'd see if they could hold it until I dropped my bags off in my room. So I hurried upstairs and headed back down for a night cap. Frank the bartender gave me a very nice pour of Scotch. It's just what I needed. This is customer service as its finest. So back upstairs, the King Suite is beautiful. There is a living room separate from the bedroom. There is a sink area with a Keurig coffee maker and a microwave. AND in addition to what's in the minibar, there are larger sized bottles in case you have guests! The bed is large & comfortable. The pillows are little softer than I would have liked but they were fine. The shower has great pressure, very important. There is also a full sized hair dryer. Yay! WiFi is $20/night but you can connect multiple devices. It's fast enough to stream Netflix/Hulu. The TV's in the room are huge and new. But I hope you aren't spending all your time watching TV because....The location is excellent. Very close to subways, lots of taxis around. Walk to the water, the bridges, South Street Seaport, tons of delis, restaurants & bars, etc. But if you feel like room service, the food from Felice is fantastic. Felice is the restaurant downstairs with really excellent Italian food. Get the french toast one morning and you'll be set for the day. If you order dinner, get those brussels sprouts. Oh man. They were so good. Service is very fast. If I'm nitpicking, I'd say I agree with the lighting. I didn't mind it being dark in the living room but the bathroom lighting made putting on makeup a little challenging. haha. It was fine as friends reassured me when I got outside. haha.

They also gave us celebratory cocktails on the house at the hotel bar. The gestures absolutely made my 30th that much more celebratory!We had room service for both dinner and breakfast the next day.

I'd stayed at Gild Hall before, so I knew what to expect - nice sized rooms, warm welcome, quiet nights (good sleep), excellent food. What blew me away was how well the staff at the hotel remembered me - by name. They also remembered the name of my partner, though she wasn't traveling with me this time. It made me feel right at home. The cherry on top was that I had mentioned in passing that I was coming for an interview, and the manager, David, left a personal note in my room to wish me luck. I can't remember the last time I had this treatment at a hotel. Gild Hall is definitely a place that puts PEOPLE first. They've earned a fond place in my heart, and if there's anyone else that needs a good night's sleep in a quieter part of town (at night), with fantastic food and service, then this is definitely the place to be!","Providence, Rhode Island","ialdenrussell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Providence, Rhode Island</strong>",3,5.0

I wanted a place that would seem more like a gift instead of just a place to sleep. After visiting several local hotels to check the rooms and get a sense of the staff and mood, I visited Gild Hall. After talking with Ileana in the sales department, my search was over. Ileana was engaged and attentive. She didn't just casually show the rooms, she got involved. She was interested in helping me make the hotel a part of my family's holiday experience. I spoke with Ileana in late October and the visit was set for Christmas. The hotel had told me the morning of my family’s arrival that they could check us in no sooner than 3p. They were turning over nearly every room in the hotel from a fully booked night before. Understandable. But when we arrived at 3p the rooms weren't ready. That’s when the excellent staff really showed their worth. They turned the inconvenience into an opportunity to show off the extent of their hospitality. Khloe at the front desk was excellent. David the front desk manager greeted us each morning with a genuine smile. Bjoern, the general manger met with me to let me know we need not worry about another thing during our stay. I do not have time in this brief review to list the host of specific and thoughtful ways in which the hotel accommodated us after not being able to check in right away. The response was unlike any experience I've had at any hotel (and I have had extended stays at many of NYC's finest--The Greenwich, The Crosby, The Andaz, The Four Seasons, The Bowery Hotel, The Rivington.) I'll sum it up simply by revealing there was a Christmas tree involved—dutifully sought out, retrieved and adorned by bellman Rob. My family was wonderfully overwhelmed with the whole experience. We moved our plans for opening gifts on Christmas morning from my apartment to the hotel. We had Christmas Eve dinner, ordered up from Felice downstairs, at the hotel. Gild Hall exceeded expectations. It was perfect.One more thing. In a city district almost void of really great food I was surprised and overjoyed to find the food at Felice to be fantastic. Rustic Italian fare cooked to perfection and served by an attentive, smart staff. When you stay at Gild Hall, make an appointment for dinner.

We were also VERY unhappy to find someone had illegally put my name down for their bill at the bar. It would seem a guest had overheard my surname and room number at reception and decided to charge it to my room.

The location is perfect for anyone working in the financial district, yet convenient to several subway stops, so it only took 15-20 minutes to get to Times Square. Rooms are fine with nice high ceilings. We enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast and I appreciated the gluten-free options.  However I have a suggestion for the one major complaint, the same one as other reviewers had here: the translucent glass on the bathroom door. When I read about this, I assumed the glass would be frosted, but it's clear glass with stripes in it. So you really can see right into the bathroom. This presents the obvious problem of no privacy, which, even for us longtime married folks, isn't desirable. And it is a big issue for anyone traveling with a friend or, more significantly, children. The other problem this creates is turning on the bathroom light in the middle of the nite wakes up the other person in the room, which also was very undesirable. When I checked in, it was apparent another guest was complaining about the bathroom door to the desk clerk so I asked if there was a room where the door wasn't so visible from the bed. Two of the staff, including the bellman, Rob, who was very helpful, offered to show me rooms, which I really appreciated. I was able to get a room where the bathroom wasn't in front of the bed. But it was still not totally private and the light shown through into the room. When I later discussed this issue with the weekend manager, Chloe, who, like the rest of the staff, was very gracious and helpful, she said the rooms will be remodeled next year to correct the door problem. Since that will take a while, she promised to pass this tip on to her boss: Just add hooks to the wood above the top of the glass panels, for each of the bathroom doors, then guests can hang the hotel bathrobes there and it will offer privacy. For guests,if you don't have bathrobes in the closet, ask for them. If there aren't hooks yet, (hopefully soon), you can hang the robe on wood between the glass but it's not as secure. See the photo. Also there are two light sources in the bathroom, so just use the softer light instead of the brighter florescent one. We will return often to NYC and plan to stay here again. But hopefully the bathroom doors will be fixed soon. And it also would be nice to have coffee /tea in the room, which is offered in nearly every hotel these days. With those improvements, I'm sure I'll be able to give this place five stars the next time we stay there.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","mto310</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",14,4.0

To say the least, this was not welcome news at 1 AM when I arrived after a 6 hour flight from San Francisco, and given that I had morning meetings the next day.They found a room for me at another hotel and paid for it, but by the time I was settled in the other hotel room, it was 2:30 AM. The next morning, someone from the Gild called me to make sure I was leaving the other hotel, because they wanted to be sure I knew they weren't paying for another night.Then they sent me an automated email saying my ""revised"" reservation started that day, and I was already in the cancellation period. Nice touch! I was furious.I travel on average every other week for work, and have stayed at hotels all over the NYC financial district, including the Gild. It has never been my absolute favorite, but I have thought it was OK. The glass door to the bathroom would be a real problem if I weren't saying alone. And sometimes the rooms aren't spotlessly clean. I actually like the restaurant.However, the number one most important thing to me is that I actually have a room when I arrive, and that's a promise the Gild can't seem to keep.For around the same money and in the same neighborhood, I highly prefer the Andaz Wall Street if it's available.","Berkeley, California","Mamabearette</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berkeley, California</strong>",48,2.0

The room was smaller than I would have expected and we didn't have enough room for 2 suitcases and 2 carry on bags. Being on the 4th floor on the road side it was extremely noisy. The room doors do not seal and light can be seen from below, i.e. you can hear other people walking to their rooms and their doors closing. The general cleanless was poor and I don't think I have seen a shower curtain in a hotel for years, especially a 4 star! With no coffee/tea facilities in the room I just felt its more of a 3 star. I do not feel the layout of the rooms is efficient and $5 charge for a jug of tap water makes it feel just like a major chain which is disappointing. The aircon was extremely old and we ended up having the window open as it was quieter than turning on the old fan!

One of the desk lamps did not work. The lights that did work were very harsh i.e. too bright and fluorescent. This was particularly problematic because there's very limited natural light coming in through the window during the day or at night. In addition, the temperature control to be a bit wonky. The room was stuffy when I first checked in, and when I turned on the air conditioning (or heater), it quickly became way too cold. I couldn't find a way to make the room breezy and not freeze at the same time. Overall, I felt that while the room had interesting design elements, the comfort level is inferior to, say, a Double Tree or Four Point. During much of my stay inside the room, I kept thinking how much more I would have enjoyed chain hotel room... And sadly this is an issue I find with many boutique hotels. 2) The room service menu was a bit too Italian-centric.

Rooms were fairly spacious by Manhattan standards, clean, and the bed was comfortable as well. The appointments and theme of the hotel is unique as well, with sort of a 60s vibe to it and excellent design and appointments to boot. The only discernible downside: the elevators are a little slow. But who cares about that really? Overall, this place earns the five star rating on pretty much every level. It is clearly well managed from the bottom up - a well oiled machine.

The lobby is very well designed and looks amazing. The bar/restaurant attached to the hotel is equally as awesome. The bartenders like to flex their drink making muscles and can make you any kind of drink that suits your fancy. Even can suggest types of drinks you may never heard of and that will blow your mind (speaking from experience). They own a vineyard in Italy where they grow the grapes that make some of the wines available to drink. So aside from the front desk and lobby bar/restaurant where you could spend hours, the rest of the hotel is very nice. The rooms are kept immaculate, well stocked with supplies, and have luxuriously comfortable beds. King sized beds with pillows and duvets that will make you wish you could sleep in one at home. I have yet to find a hotel with a bed as comfortable as these ones!All in all this hotel would definitely be recommended as somewhere you must stay if you're in NYC. Steps from a subway station that has 4 subway lines that can take you anywhere in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Only about a 10 minute walk from the Brooklyn bridge but only about a 5 minute walk to the piers where you can get an amazing view of the bridge day or night. No worries about wandering around near the hotel at night as the area is quite safe. In the heart of the financial district, a couple minutes away from the new Freedom tower being built where the twin towers fell, you're close to many things that lower Manhattan has to offer. There are starbucks, dunkin donuts, burger king, mcdonalds all nearby if you choose to eat fast food rather than the better food choices in the area.

Location is perfect for both those on return visits to Manhattan as well as first timers as the area is relatively quiet on an evening (perfect for recharging after a long day) while still being pretty close to Fulton St station if you want to travel up to the hustle of Midtown or elsewhere.That said there's plenty to do in the area later on within few blocks walk if you are in the mood to eat or drink. With Stone St not far away and plenty of choice about 15 mins walk away in TriBeCa. The Seaport, Brooklyn Bridge and WTC are all also in walking distance.The hotel bar is very welcoming. The bartenders are friendly and willing to chat , or if you just want a little peace and quiet there's seating away from the bar itself. Happy hour during the week is a good time to chill out over a couple of drinks after a busy day, or before heading out for dinner.We have never dined in the restaurant (neither Felice, or the previous Libertine) but the menu looks good, and it seems to get plenty of business.The rooms are of an adequate size for Manhattan. The bed is very comfortable, there's a good size TV with plenty of choice of channels.Every thing is kept clean and tidy and there is plenty of storage space. On tip for first timers would be to remember the cross st to direct the cab driver to. I tend to ask for the corner of Platt & William St. now as ""Gild Hall, Gold St"" doesn't seem to help them. The hotel is about a minutes walk from there, or you could point the driver down the street to the entrance.As previously said we have stayed here 3 times now, and are currently planning another visit in January, which won't be our last.","Yarm, United Kingdom","turnleftwhenboarding</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yarm, United Kingdom</strong>",0,5.0

The rooms are stylish and yet have a classic and bespoke feel that gives the Gild Hall the look and feel of a modern-day inn.The repeated artwork that bedecks each of the floors belies a little bit of a cookie-cutter approach to concept decor.

The rooms are a reasonable size and comfortable although I so wish american hotels would replace the silly half depth baths with better quality showers.

Amazingly, our room was already available and with the free WiFi we could do some work, freshen up and then head into the Financial District for meetings. Upon returning after a long day, the wonderfully comfortable bed and quiet surroundings meant a sound, a very welcome, night's sleep. If I have one slight negative it's that the aircon unit was unexpectedly noisy (certainly compared to other rooms I've stayed in at the hotel) but it's genuinely the only 'fault' I could mention and not even on that prevented me from dropping off to sleep even with my body still very much on GMT time.I cannot recommend the Gild Hall enough whether for business or pleasure, you'll find welcoming, friendly staff, a clean and well-proportioned room and one of the comfiest beds in Manhattan,","London, United Kingdom","Geoff W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",6,5.0

Close by are the Stock Exchange, Trinity Church and the World Trade Center Memorial. The main entrance to the hotel is on Platt Street, as clearly marked on the hotel's website (and even on this page). I should have paid more attention because at first my driver couldn't find it! The restaurant is right off the lobby/library area and is called Felice Ristoranti.You can see the restaurant from the street, so look for that because the hotel entrance is hard to see. Right before Felice, there is a nice bar with a good snack/small plates menu. Try the short rib sliders and fries because I found them delicious. Great wine selection too (including by the glass, which is what I did). Breakfast was particularly enjoyable - organic eggs, sunflower toast and roasted new potatoes (bacon, sausage etc is available). Also, there is an upper-level wine lounge called La Soffitta with big comfy chairs. Rooms are a fair size for NYC and the furniture is functional. Bed was OK. The only issue might be the frosted glass doors to the bathroom. Through the door, you would certainly be able to see anyone in the bathroom. No problem for me because I was alone on a business trip! This was a very pleasant hotel with smart, pleasant staff who asked me several times if I needed help with dinner reservations, directions etc. I will certainly stay here again.

The reasons why start as soon as you walk through the front door. It’s more than the warm wood floors or comfy leather appointed furniture that greats you; It’s the home away from home with friends feel you get from the glass of Prosecco welcoming you or the checkers board in the living room’esque lobby waiting to be played. But just a nice environment does not a great hotel make; it ultimately comes down to the staff. I’m not going to list all of the Gild Hall persons who consistently go above and beyond as it would literally be a reprint of the entire staff directory. Rather, I’ll list the adjectives that come to mind when I think of everyone I’ve met: attentive, warm, professional, attention to detail, conscientious, accommodating, welcoming, friendly… I’ll stop now before I run out of space, but these are the attributes that sets Gild Hall apart from a cold, sterile, corporate factory hotel with an ever changing staff. Instead, it’s a boutique hotel that you enjoy coming to as much as the city itself. In essence, that’s really the key to my love for Gild Hall. I just really like coming here because of the staff as much as I love coming to NYC. Which I do. A lot. The great location doesn’t hurt either. Gild Hall is about a 15 min subway ride, straight shot, from Penn Station. It’s close to the Fulton station which is a hub for the 2,3,4,5,A,C,J,Z lines and walking distance to the PATH train at World Trade Center and to the south ferry terminal. If you’re there for business, it’s perfectly located in lower Manhattan. If you’re there for pleasure, it’s quietly nestled away from all the hustle and bustle crowds and tourist masses so you can relax and decompress at the end of the day.I will end my love letter to Gild Hall with a recount of one of the many incidents that keep me coming back. I had been away for several months, long enough to have been forgotten by any chain hotel, and I decided to pass though NYC at Christmas on the spur of the moment. Someone saw my name on the register that day and when I arrived to my room there were cupcakes and a note saying welcome back waiting for me. Cupcakes! Not some pillow chocolates, but cupcakes! Waiting for me on Christmas Eve. That’s the warm feeling I get here and nowhere else. And that right there sums up why Gild Hall is my home away from home.",,MrCDuncan,0,5.0

Friendly helpful staff, good location for sightseeing!Questionables: We could not open our blinds in our room as their were offices and condo's directly across and close...felt a bit claustrophobic because of that.....No coffee makers in room. It feels like a budget hotel, room was small, one of the smallest rooms we have ever stayed in NYC. They wasted half of the closet space with a minibar and expensive alcohol and snacks. We’d rather have more space to put our clothes than expensive snack, alcohol that I won’t partake in. Bathroom also has two small shelves over the toilet disappointing if you are staying for more than a few days. There is a free standing sink with limited room for accessories. No storage area in the bathroom. There is only a towel bar to hang your towel and no other hooks to hang anything else. They had only 2 bath towels and hand towels, we have never stayed at a hotel that only provides only 2 bath towels, with no place to hang the wet ones if you have to reuse one. The Bad: The room we stayed had a glass bathroom door. This alone will make our decision not to stay here again. Whoever thought this idea up must travel alone. We have never seen anything so awkward and annoying. You are in a small room and the only privacy you may ever get is in the bathroom that has a glass door. We had to buy 2 cheap table cloths from the nearby store and tape the doors over. We will not recommend this hotel to our friends based solely on this design. Every time someone had to use the bathroom during the night and put the light on, the entire room would be lit up. Bad design! It our opinion, Gild Hall is an ok, average hotel, however with that bathroom design, there are much better choices in the city and will look elsewhere when visiting the city in the future.",Florida,"oscmj</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Florida</strong>",49,3.0

Our room was a good size, clean, comfortable and I liked the design and color palette. If you are looking for things to do in that area, there are plenty, especially now that the 9/11 Memorial and Museum are open but, in addition,there are many ferries going to many places (Brooklyn, Liberty State Park, Statute of Liberty etc). You can't beat the bike ride up the Hudson River Greenway (the path up the East River is more disjointed). I believe the hotel has bikes (we rode ours from the ferry and they stored them for us downstairs).

We traveled to NYC for the fireworks display on the 4th, as well as a birthday weekend, and couldn't have been more pleased with the accomodations. Gild Hall is tucked away on a little side street in lower Manhatten, on Gold St., but the entrance is on Platt St. Even the cabbie had a bit of difficulty finding it, but we made the block and viola! It has a classy, understated entrance with a red awning, but once you walk in...WOW! The upscale, hip, cool decor and wonderful aroma in the lobby welcomed us as much as the friendly staff. They couldn't have been more attentive to my lost luggage situation, and helped me with complimentary toiletries as well as finding a place to buy clothes at a nearby department store. Many thanks to them all! The lobby is attached to a nice and always lively bar, and the very nice Felice Italian restaurant is connected right next door. Both were wonderful.The room was right next to the quick response elevators, which worried us to start with, but we never heard any noise during our 3 nite stay. We had a spacious room for NY, with a soft king bed, and small fridge. Other reviewers mentioned the small rooms, but this one was very nice and plenty of room, especially since we were there only late nite. Great stay! We plan to go back again! TIP: the ice machine closest to the 16th floor was behind an unmarked door, but count 4 doors down on the right past the elevators.Close to Wall St. and the financial district and 9/11 museum, and fairly close to Battery Park and the Statue of Liberty.

The Good:Location: For people who want to be away from the crowds of the midtown this is a great alternative. I like the Financial District area; it is very quiet at nights and the weekends and very convenient via subway. I recommend getting a subway pass if you want to see the city though since walking to uptown will take you a good 40 minutes. Hotel is located to many subway lines and it took me 10 minutes to go to East 57th street with metro. There are many parking lots in the area if you have your car with you. Everything is within walking distance, restaurants, subway, various cafes, and pharmacies. Rooms: I had a corner room in one of the upper floors; it did not have any adjoining rooms and was very quiet. You could crack open the window a bit. Bathroom was clean also. Even though the décor is modern it is not a brand new hotel and you can tell. It had very limited furniture and next to none closet/storage space which can be an issue if you are staying here for long, but it was OK for me. The room did not have curtains, just wooden blinds that goes with the hotel’s lodge décor, but I would have preferred blackout curtains. Overall it met my basic expectations of noise and cleanliness. Staff: Staff was very nice, front desk employees were all young and friendly and helpful. The Bad: Luxury is in the details and Gild Hall did not deliver on that aspect. It seems and feels like a budget hotel, not at all a 4 star which is supposed to be above average. Room was tiny, the smallest place I have ever stayed which includes hotels in midtown and others in downtown. They say hotels in downtown have larger rooms, but this was not the case. I am a small person and I kept bumping into furniture because there was pretty much no room to move. Also I am surprised that in such a small room they wasted half of the closet space with a minibar and unnecessary snacks. I’d rather have space to put my clothes than candy that I won’t eat. And of course room is packed with candy, water, wine etc that they want you to purchase, a little too much I thought. Bathroom also has almost no storage with a free standing sink. They had couple shelves above the toilet but again not enough if you stay there more than few days. Standard bottles shampoo, lotion etc but no shower cap. They made sure there are no hooks to hang your stuff either. There is only a towel bar to hang your towel and no other hooks to hang anything else. In such a small space I would assume they would put hooks on the walls and doors to give people some extra space to hang things also they can easily add shelves above the bathtub to store towels, most hotels so that. They had only couple bath towels and hand towels, and if you are a couple or family you will not have enough towels and again no place to hang the wet ones. It was rather annoying. I drove to the city and parked in one of the parking garages in the neighborhood, most places are $30/24 hours plus tax. Hotel charges you $55/day, no clue why, especially when there are many other garages all around the place. There is no free WIFI in the rooms, I think they should offer that.The Ugly: I am not sure if all the rooms are the same, but the room I stayed had a glass bathroom door. Who on earth would come up with this idea? I have never seen anything so illogical in my life. You are in a tiny room and the only privacy you may ever get is in the bathroom that has a glass door! I cannot even imagine what families with kids thought of that. I will not recommend this hotel to people that are not too comfortable with each other solely because of this reason. I ended up hanging a pashmina over the door, and if I did not have anything with me I would probably ask for an extra sheet. From my perspective that is unacceptable. Even if you are staying there alone you may have guests coming up and imagine, a definite NO!Bottom Line: I recommend Gild Hall to solo travelers looking for a clean, quiet place. I do not think it is great for larger groups. It is not luxurious by no means, so do not get fooled by the star ratings, but it is clean and quiet and they do welcome pets!Tips: Don't forget to try pastries at Financier Patisserie down the street.","Boston, Massachusetts","Bostonian1999</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",16,3.0

There are several subway lines near the hotel making getting pretty much anywhere in NYC pretty easy from here.The room was nice - one odd thing was the location of the bathroom in relation to the room / bed.

It is a thrill to find a cozy place to stay that bucks the cookie cutter molds of the big chains, or a restaurant that oozes atmosphere and caters to locals in the know. Gild Hall has all of that. The best word would be ""boutique"", but at reasonable rates for New York. From the unique, almost lodge-like lobby, to the utterly charming bar and restaurant, the first impression is, ""This is a cool little place."" The staff at the front desk is courteous and very pleasant. Robert checked us in and was engaging and professional. The hotel is small, but clean and charming, very European feeling. The location is on a quiet corner in the Financial District, not far from the Federal Reserve. There are a handful of coffee shops and small restaurants nearby, but it is a very short walk to Broadway. It was nice to be staying out of earshot from all of the hustle and bustle, but to have all of the shopping and dining you could want just a block and a half away. One of the reasons I booked with Gild Hall was not only the positive TripAdvisor reviews, but also the responsiveness of the hotel's general manager, Mr. Bjoern Blaha, to all of the reviews, whether they were gushing with compliments, or had a nit pick or two. And I would find out just how responsive Mr. Blaha is with his guests. I emailed him for advice on how best to get to the restaurant where my wife and I would be celebrating a special anniversary. Not only was he very helpful with several transportation options, but he upgraded our room, and showed as much enthusiasm for our special weekend as we did! We communicated several times leading up to our stay. I really felt the hotel was as invested in making our experience a memorable one as I was in planning it. As the weekend approached, I contacted Mr. Blaha once more to find a salon where my wife could have hair and makeup before our big night. He introduced his concierge, Ms. Peri Silverberg, and she got to work scheduling an amazing indulgence for my unsuspecting bride. Ms. Silverberg arranged an appointment with a very hip Soho salon, where makeup artists and stylists from Vogue transformed her from a beautiful mom into a stunning runway model! Every time she caught a glimpse in a mirror or storefront, she couldn't help but giggle with delight.We were thrilled with the spacious upgrade that Mr. Blaha provided. The King Suite was decadent by Manhattan standards, and featured a huge living room, a convenient efficiency kitchen, a sumptuous marble and glass tiled bath, and a very funky and comfortable bedroom. We almost wanted to skip dinner and just enjoy our chic pad.We returned to our room to find a complimentary bottle of Prosecco, a sweet note wishing us a happy anniversary, and vouchers for my wife's favorite drink at the bar. I can't compliment Mr. Blaha and his staff enough for making this a magical and very special weekend. We will definitely return to Gild Hall the next time we find ourselves in New York!",,Bill M,1,5.0

I'm going to err on the harsh side and rate it in relation to my expectations....So... the hotel is a flash place and obviously designed by or for some very masculine people. Dark bold colours, lots of leather and bookcases abound downstairs. Our room was missing quite a few perhaps expected items: no kettle (I'm a Brit, forgive me), no iron, no hairdryer, a brutally bright light in the bathroom and no way of turning the bathroom light on without waking up your bed colleague.But, most of all the thing that most made me deeply distrust the hotel was the bottle of water by the bed. A litre of lovely water, which after our twelve hour journey was much desired. However, just before opening it I spotted the $8 price tag. I know this is New York City but really, $8 for a bottle of water?! And printing on a clear plastic sticker that you are putting on a clear plastic bottle. What a pathetic piece of marketing. There was even a second smaller bottle for $6 on a shelf.The restaurant served a pleasant breakfast, if very overpriced. The mixologist barman worked some wonders for us and, if I was to return to the hotel, it would be only to have a drink at the bar.If you're thinking of visiting as a tourist to New York I'd recommend going somewhere further up Manhattan: East Village probably, for me. This really is so far south that it's only useful if you're (1) working in the financial district, (2) going to be visiting the Statue of Liberty every day or (3) plan on taking numerous helicopter flights.","Exeter, United Kingdom","ncw73</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Exeter, United Kingdom</strong>",103,4.0

Really importantly, the room was spotless! We thought the location of the hotel was amazing - after spending our days sight seeing and exploring NYC it was great to come back to the relaxed, comfortable, and lovely surroundings of the hotel. Close enough to busy streets and the subway to make it convenient, but hidden away and secluded enough to give you a little break from the activity of the big city. A really short walk to the nearest Subway station.......We'll definitely be coming back to the Gild Hall the next time we stay in NYC - great place, great location, AMAZING staff, great food and drink, great atmosphere.......a top notch place which really helped make this a really special weekend. Thanks to all the staff - top notch! :-)",,505PeterB505,9,5.0

Staff were exceedingly helpful and friendly and the hotel is located close to Fulton Street Subway station which is good for a range of subway lines. Just a couple of small quibbles.

Wifi is free in the lobby but I only found that our when I saw a lot of people sitting their with computers!Secondly you get a voucher from breakfast but it allows you only to have the continental breakfast which, although ok wore a bit thin after 5 days.

Well, I was more than happy to read all of the wonderful reviews, and after our stay there last week - I see why! This is a fabulous GEM of a hotel - hip and inviting décor, good size comfortable room with a nice bathroom (great smelling bath products) and lots of good snacks, friendly and helpful staff, a great little bar area, and easy access to the subway and taxis. One other big plus is how quiet the hotel is, and what a nice thing in NY to have little if any street noise! We didn't get a chance to eat at Felice, but the menu looked delicious and is run by an Italian family who owns multiple properties in Manhattan.And to top it off, I emailed the manager Mr. Bjoern Blaha, to let him know of our family's situation, and he graciously upgraded our room and was more than happy to answer any and all questions.We will absolutely return to this hotel when back in NY- and make an effort to check out other Thompson properties from now on!","Long Beach, California","courtney a</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Beach, California</strong>",14,5.0

One problem was the room struggled to deal with the freezing temperatures outside. It wasn't cold in the room but it often felt like it could be warmer and the heating was on full all day. I realise the weather in New York has been unusually cold this winter but I think the heating looks a bit dated and could use being upgraded. I guess not being locals we aren't used to the bitter cold of New York. The location is good although it takes a while to get your bearings around the area. Even Taxi drivers didn't know the street. So make sure you bring a map. Surprised that breakfast wasn't included but I gather that this is normal in the USA. In Europe almost all hotels include breakfast. I liked the decor of the place, I like the classic look although my girlfriend disagreed. It does sometimes feel more like you're entering a bar in the evening rather than a hotel. The reception desk is not in the best place but not much they can do about that I suppose.Overall, apart from the cold, the rooms are quiet and the beds are comfortable. I suppose for New York prices we got a decent deal.

Gild Hall is by far the most well thought out hotel in Manhattan, the attention to detail goes far beyond the aesthetically pleasing decor.I arrived to Gild Hall with my girlfriend shortly before 1pm looking just to drop our bags off because we knew their check-in was 3pm, but to my surprise our room which had been upgraded to a suite was available for an early check-in. The Guest Service Agent, if my memory serves me correctly I believe her name is Perry, was extremely helpful with recommending a great place for lunch and the best way to reach our destinations in Brooklyn.The Suite was amazing; it felt as if we were staying in a friends well furnished apartment for the weekend. The design of the suite was well thought out; our bathroom featured a double sink which for some people might not seem important, but they come in handy when two people are looking to prepare themselves for night on the town.Our sleep was enjoyable, we couldn’t hear any noise from the Saturday night activity of Manhattan, nor could we hear anything from the neighboring guests. The Kicker: Upon our return to the hotel on Saturday night the cable in the building had gone out due to some outside construction work, we were told this when we called the Front Desk looking to see why our TV wasn’t working. The Front Desk Agent told me that because of the cable outage that we could order movies and use WiFi without any charge. This was a great concession considering the room featured two nice mounted TVs. Overall, the experience we had at the Gild Hall was awesome. This has become the only hotel that we’ll visit when we have to make trips into Manhattan.","Bridgeport, Connecticut","B S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bridgeport, Connecticut</strong>",1,5.0

As others have noted, the hotel is located on a relatively quiet street, but is close to many subway stops, restaurants, shops, the financial district businesses, the World Trade Center construction, City Hall, etc. I did not dine at the restaurant (La Felice), but I had a drink at the bar. It was fine. Free Internet is available in the lobby, but not in the rooms (which was a disappointment).The rooms are clean and decorated in a contemporary-type way. I agree with others who say the glass bathroom walls are a disadvantage, but we weren't there long enough to really be bothered by this. I thought he bed was fine, and I liked the down comforter. Also, the room temperature was great (something I have had trouble with in other hotels).But I have to say that one of the best parts about our stay was the friendly, helpful staff. The folks at the desk were amazingly efficient, friendly, service-oriented staff. They answered every question, no matter how small, and smiled while they did it. When I was coughing excessively while sitting in the lobby, a staff member brought me a bottle of water and commiserated with me.

Most hotels trump up their prices for this night but this hotel was still within our budget. This is one reason I was pleasantly surprised it was a nice hotel. The hotel was easy to get to, about four stops from New York Penn station, and only a few blocks from the subway. At check-in we were greeted with a smile and two welcome glasses of champagne. The size of the room was average, enough space to move around plus a sitting area. Plenty of nice treats (chips and nuts by Dean and Deluca) and other amenities (wine, candles, outlet adaptor, etc.) I would not have expected (though you should check the price list before snacking). The only concerns (not really complaints) I have about the room is the bed frame and the glass enclosure of the bathroom. The bed frame is larger than the mattress so you can imagine the many stars I saw when I walked into corner of the frame and wacked my shin. Please be careful! (Suggestion to the hotel: cover the corners).Although the bathroom was very nicely updated, there was not much privacy. The walls are made of frosted glass. I like the way ‘Brendan d’ worded it, “If you're using the toilet with someone else in the room, they know exactly what’s going on.” All-in-all, it was a very pleasant stay, and we are hoping to come back in the near future.","Princeton, New Jersey","traveldiva612</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Princeton, New Jersey</strong>",3,4.0

We felt like valued customers and we also felt safe and treated right. Check in was prompt and we arrived at our room without delay. The lobby of the hotel is charmingly unique. It is not the typical hotel you would see when staying at a large chain hotel, and that is why we choose to stay here. The location is safe as well as quiet. It is in walking distance of several attractions and subway stops. The hallways are nicely painted and the facility looks well taken care of. The rooms however are honestly pretty average. The bed is nothing special, and the decor didn't blow me away. The size is also not that great, for the price, I thought it would be slightly larger. The bathroom was something of a concern. It was a nice bathroom with great toiletries, however as far as privacy goes, it was lacking. The bathroom is right next to the bed and it's walls are made of frosted glass. If you're using the toilet with someone else in the room, they know exactly whats going on. We ate at the restaurant, and we felt it could have been a better experience. That's how I would rate the hotel overall, it was very nice however you can clearly notice some aspects that could be improved upon.","Flemington, New Jersey","DohertyBK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Flemington, New Jersey</strong>",11,4.0

Our room phone was broken and was not fixed during our stay. While some of the staff came up to our room to communicate with us, others did not and completely kept us hanging, which was not professional.2. There was dried urine on the toilet seat when we checked in. That is quite unacceptable.3. We asked for slippers on our first night. The staff said they couldn't find the slippers, but promised that housekeeping would leave two pairs of slippers in our room the next morning. When we came back to the room the next evening, we still did not have slippers in our room. When I went to the front desk (since I could not call the front desk because our room phone was still broken), the lady at the front desk rudely told me I would likely not get slippers until the next morning (when we would be checking out!). I walked her through the previous night, and she asked another staff member to find slippers for me. After waiting for over half an hour for our slippers to arrive, my husband called the front desk from his cell phone. We were then told that the hotel is out of slippers and won't have any until the next shipment. I told the staff member that this was unprofessional and unacceptable, and they should have left a note in our room or communicated this with us somehow. About half an hour after we hung up, a staff member showed up with slippers, at which point, we had already showered and it was too late...4) Housekeeping should be quieter in the hallway in the mornings, when they're knocking on the doors and *yelling* ""housekeeping!"" loudly early in the morning.

I simply didn’t think that this hotel was nearly as great as many other reviewers have indicated. I’m young and pretty open to all types of hotel and décor, but nothing here really stood out to me as great. I thought it was just ok overall.The first thing to note is Gild Hall’s location. I was well aware of the meandering, narrow streets of the area ahead of time, but I was unhappy with the fact that Gild Hall is located on a very depressing sort of side street. The particular street the hotel is on just had an alley-like, overly dirty feel to it that I did not like. It took away from the experience. However, I will admit that I heard no noise from the room and got a very good night’s sleep, so the location may be good in that sense, and if you need to be downtown, it is convenient to many things. It was an easy walk from the office I needed to get to, as well as to many major downtown restaurants and attractions. We enjoyed being able to easily walk to Battery Park, South Street Seaport, and the World Trade Center area.We drove in and parked at the hotel. I really didn’t find it as hard to find the hotel as others have mentioned. It’s definitely harder to find things downtown versus other areas of Manhattan, but it was no problem with the aid of a GPS. The hotel is at the corner of Gold & Platt Streets, with an address on Gold Street. However, if you’re driving in, note that you’ll want to come in on Platt Street for the hotel’s front entrance and valet. Parking for the night was $65 (my small SUV was a little bit extra because it counted as oversized), which will always be a lot of money just to park, but really isn’t unexpected or outrageous in New York. We arrived at normal check-in time in the late afternoon, and I was surprised how unprepared the front desk staff was to handle guests at that time. It wasn’t even very busy, but the woman who was working the front desk was totally flustered and not overly professional (but nice enough). I’m not sure if she was new at the time, but it took almost five minutes to get my credit card successfully swiped before someone else had to come show her what to do, and the overall process just felt laborious. She also failed to provide functioning room keys, so after the lengthy check-in process, I only had to come right back down from the room to get new keys when I couldn’t get into my room. She was apologetic, and it wasn’t a huge deal, but my initial impression of the hotel wasn’t the best. This was a bit odd, since the staff I encountered at the front desk the next day was 100% more competent and efficient, handling billing and putting in a late checkout with ease. I guess it’s somewhat hit-or-miss at the front desk. The overall feel of Gild Hall is a sort of dark, masculine hunting lodge, which I definitely do like in principle. The lobby, while a bit small, definitely carries this out, as do the rooms. The rooms are very dark, with dark carpet and wood throughout. However, I think the rooms go beyond being nicely masculine, bordering on gloomy. The fact that the rooms get basically no natural sunlight due to closely neighboring buildings contributes to the overall gloominess, which I didn’t like. It doesn’t help that the lighting was quite dim. The room wasn’t a bad size, and the king bed was comfortable with a really interesting leather headboard. However, on the whole, it just felt a bit more depressing than I would like. The bathroom was nicely appointed and seemed recently redone, with nice tile and marble floors. It was an ok size for New York, although there was really no storage space for toiletries. Be aware that the bathrooms lack privacy. One bathroom wall and the door are completely glass. Although it’s not totally see-through, it’s close enough. My girlfriend and I both commented that it was a bit too much for our taste. You’ll be on display to anyone you’re traveling with at all times in the bathroom. I also felt that our room had an ever-so-slightly dirty feel to it. I couldn’t really put my finger on what made it feel that way, since it was generally clean. I think this feeling came from the old air/heater unit, a bit of dust/grime in the corners of the carpet, and some wear and tear to the baseboards. Also, don’t expect to get work done at the desk in the room. The desk is very narrow and the desk chair, while visually appealing, isn’t comfortable. The same goes for the sort of bench seating by the window. It looks comfortable and seems like a good idea, but is not very functional.One thing I found a bit odd about this hotel is that it seems there isn’t any sort of service elevator. I never realized that this makes a difference, but I’ve never been in a hotel where the elevator was so frequently filled employees with maid carts, linens, and maintenance supplies. I have no problem sharing the elevator with employees, and they were all very friendly, but it got to be a bit much, especially in the morning. There were multiple times that I had to wait for a second elevator when trying to leave because the elevators were full of employees going places. We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel’s restaurant, Felice. The restaurant is small and cheery. Breakfast wasn’t overly expensive, and I was very happy with the quality and presentation of the food. The design-your-own smoothie option was nice. The food was pretty slow to come out, and it seemed that there wasn’t much staff there to get things going. However, the meal was enjoyable and the service was very friendly. It was a good, convenient breakfast option.Overall, I wouldn’t say that we had a bad stay at Gild Hall, but it was a bit disappointing to me, given my expectations after reading TripAdvisor reviews. I expected much more for close to $500 per night. I found the location and rooms to be dark and depressing. The room was nice, but simply too dark and dingy for my liking. It simply didn’t feel as upscale as it should for the price. I wouldn’t come back unless I had a good reason to do so, since there are tons of hotels in New York City and I’m sure I could find others more to my liking in the downtown area.",New Jersey,"Matthew G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Jersey</strong>",517,3.0

There is a lot of ambiance with the design of the lobby and the hotel restaurant. This hotel might not be a good fit for families or seniors.The rooms are not large but the one I stayed in has a high ceiling. Since the building faces another building, there is not much natural light coming through the window. The light bulbs used for the ceiling lights and lamp are also not bright so expect a gloomy surrounding. Compounding the gloominess is the black carpeting.The bed frame is larger than the mattress and due to the tight space between the bed and the desk, I keep hitting my shins at the edge of the bed when I walk between them. The pillows seems to have no firmness as you lay your head down on them, your head sinks to the bottom.It is also difficult to work on the desk as its depth is short and work space is limited. The heating\AC unit seems to need maintenance as it produces a loud buzzing sound that is very distracting.Even though the room is small, the bathroom size seems adequate. The water pressure from the shower is weak. The lighting around the bathroom mirror is bright but the sink is a pedestal so there is no counter space.

Decided to stay downtown to avoid the weekend crowds and high midtown/uptown holiday room rates. Subway station only two blocks from the hotel with Broadway/Times Square only a 15 minute subway ride away. Two $2.50 subway tokens Vs a total $50 to $60 cab fare to get you to Times Square and back. The hotel is clean, the holiday rates very competitive and the staff exceptional. The hotel's room decor is on the minimalist side, not our preference but well executed. The staff was exceedingly friendly, very helpful and all we encountered had a wonderful sense of humor making for a fun stay.Felice the restaurant affiliated with Gild Hall was used for breakfast each day of our stay. The quality and selection of entrees was excellent. More importantly you can get a great breakfast with a bottomless cup of coffee from $10 to $15. This is very modest pricing by NY standards. Katie, our server for each of our three days, was exceptional. Had our preferences down after our first visit, was a lot of fun and took very good care of us.We took advantage of Gild Hall's ""Suite Deal"" promotion, a 560 sq. ft. suite including a small bar area, large bath with double sinks, welcoming gift, free paper, free Internet service, living room, separate bedroom with king bed and two large screen HD TV's. Since the hotel is in the financial district, their weekend rates are very competitive. We stayed from Thurs. to Sunday with the average night's tariff, with out taxes, of $355. I would challenge anyone to find a comparable priced full suite in any mid or uptown hotel during the Xmas season for this price.We will consider this downtown holiday option in the future. There is much to see in and around the downtown financial district, including the 911 Memorial and Museum, Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Fraunces Tavern, the oldest building in New York serving great food and fun, walk the Brooklyn Bridge, the South Side Seaport, a nice walk to both China Town and Little Italy,etc. Our thanks to the Gild Hall team for providing us with a fun long weekend stay.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","paul s</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",36,5.0

For a higher end boutique hotel, we got really affordable rates for the room block that gave our guests a cool hotel experience without breaking the bank. Esther coordinated our room block reservation and we worked with her in the weeks leading up to the wedding. She was super helpful, very responsive and a pleasure to work with. We didn’t want to blow a ton of dough on our hotel room, so we booked a standard king suite. Nothing too fancy. But when we checked in, Esther upgraded us to their Thompson Suite, then upgraded my father’s room to the king suite. The Thompson suite was HUGE, with 20 foot soaring ceilings, 2 bathrooms, laid out like a giant loft apartment. It was waaaay out of our price range and HUGELY appreciated. Thanks Esther for hooking it up!When we checked in for the weekend, the girl working the front desk, Perry, had just graduated from the same college I went to. She somehow quickly made friends with my entire family and was so unbelievably helpful all weekend long with whatever we needed. From sending out a dress shirt last minute to get dry cleaned, to letting up vendors to the room for deliveries, to recommending nearby food spots, she was so accommodating and is a tremendous asset to the hotel. Thanks Perry!!!I didn’t eat at the hotel but some family members did and said the food was great. At night the lobby and adjacent bar gets pretty lively, turning into a cool place to hang out, grab drinks. Not too sceney, but enough energy to make it fun for out of town guests.

Gild Hall is small enough that it doesn't feel busy or crowded when you come in and out of the hotel. I like the location which is away from the bustle of the city, but a convenient base to get around (all subways converge to lower Manhattan), especially if you are going to hang out in SOHO, NoLita, or Tribeca.Service at Gild Hall is top notch. My stay started with a glass of Prosecco offered at check in, and while the attendant was working my paperwork I mentioned to my wife that we still need to confirm our dinner reservation - he overheard this and offered to make the call himself.","Cold Spring, New York","P2Traveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cold Spring, New York</strong>",1,5.0

I got Gild Hall and after checking it out on Tripadvisor I was very pleased. But when I got to the hotel... different story :-( When I checked in (on the early side, maybe noonish) the woman at the front desk told me they only had one room available, with two beds, but if I didn't mind two beds then I could check in right away. In retrospect I think there was a reason they hadn't put anyone in that room! As soon as I got into the room I was really surprised. It was dark, ugly, and not in great shape. The lighting was all cheap fluorescents and it started giving me a migraine almost immediately (something that normally only happens with strobe lights or something extreme like that). Everything was just shabby and not very clean - the radiator was dented, there were greasy-looking fingerprints all over the guest information book on the bedside table, the headboard had marks all over it, there were bits of peeling wallpaper and worn-off paint, the baseboards are all beat up, the shower had mildew, the shower curtain had blue pen marks on it, the furniture was all scratched up, it looked like the area by the snacks hadn't been cleaned (drip marks etc.). I was late to meet someone for lunch, and I was only going to be in the room for 18 hours, so I just figured I would suck it up instead of demanding a new room since I knew there weren't any available and I would have to wait some unknown amount of time (probably making me miss my lunch appointment). I have NO IDEA how this hotel has got such good reviews on Tripadvisor. No idea. Unless this is just the one bad room in the hotel or something. But I certainly can't recommend it and it's kind of scared me off using Hotwire for a while since I feel like I can't trust their star ratings to be even remotely accurate.

We found the air conditioning in the room to be alittle on the noisy side, but not enough to keep you awake.I do feel that a hotel of this caliber should offer in-room tea and coffee, we have stayed in budget hotels that offer this.There are plenty of places to have breakfast as most workers in the financial district tend to have breakfast on the way to work.During the week the area is buzzing, from early till late, restaurants and bars are lively. At the weekend it is bit quieter, which is a pleasant change.As can be seen from previous reviews on choosing this hotel you wont be disappointed.","Guildford, United Kingdom","joseph m</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guildford, United Kingdom</strong>",48,5.0

Complimentary Prosecco at check in was a nice touch and it spoke well towards the type of hotel Gild Hall is: boutique styling with the courtesy of a corporate, but very cool, parent company, Thompson. What this equates to is the ability to be unique, small and intimate while not carrying the associations of a spotty staff or maintenance record. Gild Hall brilliantly blends modern design with warm comfort, a feat not easily achieved. The room was fantastic - 12' + ceilings opened the space and the absence of the typical hotel ""stock art"" was well received by both parties. They do very well with the little space they had, but for an NYC hotel, and one downtown, the room felt spacious and well appointed. One thing that made a huge impact was the cleanliness of the bathroom. White pedestal sink was spotless and the water pressure and hot water will not disappoint. One thing though, the bathroom has a modern touch that maybe not everyone will appreciate: the wall between it and the bedroom is translucent, and you will see the figure of whoever's in there. So, it's not for the squeamish or overly private. Otherwise a fantastic, comfortable, clean and fashionable place for those that don't want the hustle, bustle and frenzy of a some of the larger design oriented stays. Also, many hotels like this try to make their lobby into a club (Tribeca/Soho Grand), probably to boost revenue. You won't find that here, which I personally find to be great. When I go home, I don't want to push through a bunch of drunk revelers, slamming bass, and have to show my keycard to a bouncer. Here its a nice quiet trip back to my room, past the friendly front desk staff and up to bed. Thanks Gild, you made for a great weekend.","Morristown, New Jersey","Brian1021</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Morristown, New Jersey</strong>",0,5.0

We like quiet, but if you want nightlife, you have to go only a short distance to other neighborhoods.The room was nicely appointed and roomy for two. Service was very friendly and courteous. The only thing I would comment on is that we had only one robe and asked for another to be left n our room when we went out for the day. It was not there and we didn't want to call for one once we undressed for the evening. Why is a room for two outfitted with one robe anyway?They use a scent throughout the hotel. I happened to find it nice, but it might be a problem if you have scent sensitivities. We got a good rate on a weekend. I understand it is rather pricy at full price, which could affect the value rating.It is conveniently located only a few blocks to several subway lines, and a nice walk to the Brooklyn Bridge (to walk over) and to the Seaport, which is scheduled for demolition and may be disrupted in the near future.","Stratford, Connecticut","Debra G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stratford, Connecticut</strong>",29,4.0

Great location for downtown, and close to my office. On this stay (my fifth), I have decided enough is enough. The issues that I experienced were:- Arrival and they had no note of previous stays (I was advised that they had changed their systems and lost data)- Placed in a room with generator noise outside. Understandable after Hurricane Sandy, however there are no quiet rooms. If you arrive with jetlag - like me - you will also have insomnia - Having reported the room issue at 03:00 on night two to Anthony at reception, no-one called back. Nor did anyone feel the need to contact me at any point during my stay. I stayed for six nights, mainly as I had unpacked and had meetings until late most days- The next morning, after the early morning generator wake-up – I called down for breakfast at 06:30 when room service was due to start. The chef had not turned up, they would call me back. At 06:45 I called again (no call to my room). Still no chef. I noted that I needed coffee and asked for some toast. At 07:00 they called me and advised that the supervisor had decided that they could make coffee and toast. At 07:25 a bagel and coffee – and cheque - to be paid arrived. The bread for toast had not been delivered yet…… - The next morning I delivered two pairs of trousers at 06:45 for same day delivery. At 19:30 when they hadn’t arrived, I had to call reception. I was advised that the van had an accident and they would be delivered later. No note under the door…- I then searched for the TV remote, it had been removed from the room. iI notified reception. 20 minutes later, another call to reception. After 30 minutes it was handed to me with no apology, just an ""ok""? Actually Gil Hall - NOT OK!So there we have it. Every day niggles which stressed and made me dread returning to the hotel.

After few minutes he came with a black car which asked us for 75$ to LaGuardia airport. I asked the doorman to take us a real taxi and it seems expensive ,but he told us it was rush hour and there were no taxis available. The driver then asked for 60$.The traffic was not that heavy.

Check in was smooth pleasant, the desk was in direct view of the restaurant, which looked really appealing after a three hour drive. We headed there immediately after check in and had a very good meal.The room was very sleek and modern, the housekeeping staff did their job perfectly, not much more to say here really. We did not get a chance to check out the fitness facilities.Honestly the only downside is that the location is a little bit removed from some parts of the city.

It was my first time staying in the financial district of NYC (all other times I've stayed in mid-town), so some pros and cons:Pros: --Much quieter than most hotels in mid-town - most other hotels, even if you're on a high floor in a good hotel, you still hear constant street noise all night. Here, it's pretty quiet after about 7pm (and completely quiet all weekend). Also, the hotel attracts business people for the most part, so not a lot of young kids running around making noise.--Convenient to the subway (about a block and a half walk to Fulton St. station), then only about a 10 minute ride to midtown. Also plenty of good coffee/bagel places , as well as several drug stores and convenience stores within a block or two.--Excellent service. Whether we needed a cab, theatre tickets, recommendations on good restaurants nearby, or a bandaid after a long day of walking, the front desk staff was ready to help, and among the friendliest hotel staff I've ever encountered in New York. Tomo in particular was awesome.--My husband still has not stopped raving about the great gelato at the hotel restaurant.Cons:--The financial district shuts down in the early evening, so if you want to be in the midst of NY nightlife and hotspots, it's not the best location. But again, it's only a short subway ride to mid-town.--Most cabbies in NY have never heard of the hotel (since it's a smaller boutique hotel), so make sure you know the address and cross street if you're taking a cab to the hotel.All in all, I'd definitely recommend it!

Mini bar, lots of pricey bottled water, a robe, and other nuances were not used, but appreciated. Our only disappointments were that the carpet was black, which I don't know about you, but it isn't very inviting to me to take your shoes off with black carpet as it is meant to hide yucky things, and the black distressed wood furnishings just looked worn, versus faux rustic, which made the room feel tired. What would have made all that go away, would have been a coffee maker... alas not one in the room.We would recommend the hotel, especially if going to the 911 Memorial or sites in the lower part of Manhattan.

I booked the Superior Room through their website, where the room ended up being US$230 per night after all the taxes were worked in. The hotel is located in lower Manhattan, where a Holiday Inn Express will cost you the same amount. With this in view, Gild Hall represented excellent value for what you got in the room, hotel environment, location, and comparison to other hotels in the area.I thought the location was great, however, if you are a tourist, please consider Gild Hall's Lower Manhattan location. This area of the city is quieter than midtown and downtown (especially so on weekends, when the financial offices are closed). It is about a US$10 to US$20 taxi ride away from downtown and midtown, respectively. There is excellent access to the subway system (24 hours), with the Fulton Street station being a couple of blocks away -- convenient lines of the A, C, 2, 3, 4, 5.The internet was available for an extra US$15 per day (probably excluded taxes), where I declined on the internet as it was an additional charge. It is lower than what other business hotels would charge, however, it would have been great if it could have been free, even if only in the lobby. There is a Starbucks on William Street 1 block away with free Wifi access.  The staff were well-mannered, pleasant, helpful, and appeared trained for customer service. They seemed to enjoy working there and with each other. We found Brian at the front desk to be especially helpful during our stay.Gild Hall uses Bigelow toiletries, which is a plus.Rooms were clean and of interesting appointments. I loved the hallway corridors of Gild Hall. The air felt dry through the HVAC system where I didn't sleep great at night -- but this may be due to the overall dryer air in Northeast US where I was still adjusting. I'm not convinced on the light pillows used in the beds, where I would have preferred standard larger/firmer pillows. There is a lounge on the second floor where the hotel was flexible to turn down the volume of the music while I took an early morning conference call. After check-out, I learned that there are fitness facilities on several floors of the hotel. I didn't have a chance to use these facilities even if I would have known up-front. Good to know for next time.Really a good experience.","Shanghai, China","bentobox007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai, China</strong>",71,5.0

With its quiet location we were not disturbed at all by traffic noise or the city bustle.The room itself was immaculately clean, cosy and extremely comfortable. The only fault personally would be the lack of tea / coffee making facilities in the room, but that could just be my English ways.The library bar(s) and reception do feel like a world away after busy touristy days and the Felice restaurant within the hotel is excellent.Initially I was concerned the downtown location was a little isolated but there are many facilities nearby such as Duane Reade & local stores, fast-food, Fulton Street subway, Battery Park, Staten Island Ferry as well as great dining at Felice in the hotel and Harry's Bar at Hanover Square.Thank you Gild Hall for your great hospitality and for making our NY trip even more enjoyable.

Getting back to my hotel at about midnight, I was unable to get any food or a recommendation for take out. Leaving me going to bed hungry.The most troublesome experience was the restaurant, Felice which had opened since my last visit. It had been relocated upstairs to the wine bar as the downstairs space was hired out for a wall st. party. The to me seemed like an average middle of the range menu, but then maybe I've been spoilt here in Europe. I had a Burrata Toast (Crostone ?) with Aubergine(Eggplant) and Courgette (Zuchini), which was fine, there wasn't a great amount of Cheese and it could have had more taste. Then I was asked to order my main as the kitchen was closing (before 9:30), I dutifully ordered a Ragu. A few minutes later the waiter came back and let me know that the kitchen had actually closed! He was very apologetic and clearly just seemed rather helpless.I was speechless for a moment and then let him know this just wasn't acceptable. I had a glass of wine and half a starter and wasn't prepared to pay for that and then seek the remainder of my meal elsewhere. He went away to consult with the manager and a while later the manager came back to apologise and said he'd resolved it and I would have my meal. When it arrived it was decent, nothing mind blowing but perfectly nice. I had another glass of wine and some cake which both ended up being on the house to apologise for the earlier issue.So though they were very sweet and they resolved the issue it wasn't a positive experience. Average food, and needing to complain just left a bitter taste.Overall this is still a well priced option in downtown NY, with a decent FiDi location if you need to be near Wall St or World Trade Center, and nice staff, it just needs to pick up it's game. Improvements in Room Service, Restaurant and Cleanliness would put this back to a 4 or 5 rating.","London, United Kingdom","beckyblondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",8,3.0

I was looking for a 4-star reasonably priced hotel around the downtown area so I could quickly shuttle to Brooklyn at 6:30am on a Saturday morning for the Rock 'N Roll Brooklyn 10K. And this is actually one of the hotels I was looking at because I heard good things about it. And when I did the Hotwire Super Secret hotel booking I was able to get a good deal for this hotel. It is pretty much in the middle of the busy and dirty downtown/financial district area but it's location is great! It is about half a block from the Fulton St subway station, it's a few streets away from Leo's bagel (yum!), and it's so close to Wall St and it is like a block or 2 away form South Street. Oh yeah, the WTC is probably a block away. It is in a sweet corner between Platt and Gold so it is not awfully busy. It looks like other brown buildings around it so it can be easily missed but the flag can help spot it. The doormen and reception desk people are very nice and accommodating and helpful. The lobby has that nice modernized sitting area with ""animal skin"" as carpet (cool!) and it has it's own pub area too. The elevator is room key activated because of the pub area and the 2nd floor library/private party area, so that only guests can access the hotel room floors. As for the 2nd floor library, it has a lot of books around, a nice sitting area, and actually a bar area. The room that I got was the regular king room on the 5th floor. It is SMALL. Pretty much looked like a loft. The bathroom is literally 5 steps from the bed and though the sink and bath tub and bathroom decor are nice and new the door is frosted glass and you can see whoever is in the bathroom. So my best friend and I when we each use the bathroom had to make sure the lights are off so the other cannot see the inside of the bathroom. The room decor is modernized country home-- it has antler looking chandelier and the bed board is this padded leather board and the cabinets and tables are this rustic-brown color scheme. It is very MODERN. The housekeepers are very good. They keep the room clean and smell clean. I also like how fast they are to get us a taxi when we needed it. Overall, my experience is good. It's a nice retreat after being outside in the busy financial district area.",,silwJC7,4,4.0

She explained to to the staff, and the staff said they would send someone to clean it up. We left the hotel around 5pm... We actually asked the staff at concierge: DO YOU PROVIDE DAILY CLEANING SERVICE IN THIS HOTEL?! As I've seen, the hotel was not crazy busy.

It was 8x F in the room! We called the concierge right the way. The staff said they didn't have any onsite electrician in the hotel. They assume it's the problem of the fuse.

It seemed liked she was just waiting for us to arrive. We were celebrating our anniversary and our daughter's birthday. She upgraded us to the same suite where we had celebrated a previous anniversary. When we asked if this was the same beautiful room, she just smiled. Her smile is infectious! She was so excited about making our anniversary memorable.We were given suite 50. Shimmy helped us with our luggage, and he made sure we were comfortable before he left. Yes, it was Saturday, and a wedding party of about 30+ people was also checking in. Shimmy took the time to help us. He answered all of our questions and just smiled! He wanted us to call if we needed anything. We love downtown! Both of our children went to and graduated from NYU (New York University). During the past eight years, we have stayed in almost every hotel in NYC. The Gild Hall is one of the best! When you arrive at Gild Hall, they will treat you as old friends and special guests. My husband and I are public school teachers, so we’re not rich. However, when we arrived at Gild Hall, we were treated like royalty. The bed was so comfortable! I was worried about no top sheet, so I brought my own. No need! The room was pristine clean. I read every review, all 300 of them, before we went.We love the Gild Hall. We were on the 5th floor and we heard no noise; we don’t go to bed at 8pm, but we are not up until 2 am either. We had great service from Caitlin, Louis, Shimmy, Fang, Ginette, and Brian.A wonderful room and great people made our stay fantastic.

Even though a hotel is basically only a place to sleep, little things can make huge difference and shape how I remember places.I for example note how the reception staff comes across (stressed, artificial or relaxed and genuinely friendly etc), how clean the hotel is and if booked, what is offered complimentary and how. Certainly the size of the room and the location of the hotel is important as well, but those are minor points to me.I booked this hotel as it was one of a few (within a price range below $300/night) that offered valet parking in Manhattan and indeed, the location (walking distance to the 9/11 memorial etc) did not disappoint. The hotel also has a very nice interior, is clean and the rooms have a good size.What buggered me however was that it appears to be so up-market, that not only you would have to pay $10 for a 1l bottle of fancy water from the mini bar, but also that the complimentary breakfast ($15 value) was a bowl of fruit served with two slices of toast and some jam. All this accompanied by a cup of ""resurrection coffee"" (so strong it could wake the dead) and apparently freshly squeezed orange juice that didn't taste anything like fresh. When asked (beforehand) if it was possible to exchange the set complimentary breakfast for another item on the menu with less value, we were told that it was hotel policy not to do this...So what do I take away from my stay: great location, nice hotel, good sleep, next morning ruined by a management that wants to save money and only offers one set breakfast (while other hotels offer you a continental breakfast buffet) accompanied by coffee that can wake the dead and staff that is irritated if you ask for hot water to water it down.PS. If you drive into Manhattan and you are nervous where to park your car (as I was), you don't need a hotel with valet parking, where are plenty of car parks around you can choose from at a lower rate.",Toronto,"Chris C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",35,3.0

I was feeling quite pleased with myself for having found my way from Fulton Street subway without referring to a map, even more pleased when I was told my booking was being upgraded to a king room and that reception would take care of my bags until the room was ready an hour later at 3pm. Quick little visit to the South Street Seaport, less than 5 minutes walk away - yes, it's touristy, but I am a tourist and there's no shortage of bars and restaurants; there were some Brazilian musicians promoting Recife and a very nice little bar in the sun where I enjoyed a strawberry daiquiri before heading back to check in. The room was great, 14th floor, fresh and well fitted, Frette bathrobe, beautiful quality bedlinen, iPhone/iPod docking station, plenty of power points for plugging in power adaptors to recharge non-iPhone etc. In fact the room was so nice and I had got up so early that there was a huge temptation, resisted, to have a little zizz for an hour or so.Returning to hotel on foot late night was a bit of a maze. NYC police officers, despite being very helpful with suggested directions, just don't have the comparable geographical knowledge of a typical UK police officer! Free wifi would have made the stay totally perfect; in a city where there is plenty of free wifi in coffee shops, restaurants, in parks and plazas charging $15 seemed quite excessive, especially as I was probably only going to access wifi for about half an hour. I missed having it.Breakfast was nicely casual, continental breakfast items set out along the ground floor cocktail bar, decent sized mugs for coffee or tea, different types of milk for those avoiding or enjoying the various fat contents! Bread for toasting, cheese, butter, pots of jam, halved crossants, fruit juice, newspapers, staff busily clearing tables and topping up the breakfast stocks on the bar as people came and went. Having decided I fancied an extra day or two there, the reception was unable to offer me a price approaching that which I had paid online. They suggested that I checked online to try and find a better price, but I didn't feel inclined to pay for wifi to try and better the prices and when I was out and about, my phone battery ran down fairly quickly as I was photo snapping and draining the battery with wifi usage. It does seem daft that one has to go online to try and get a better price than the hotel in which you are already staying can offer when they have room availabilty!I loved the location; the Brooklyn Bridge was minutes away and the walk there and back was a highlight, quite breathtaking views and I cannot believe how many photographs got taken. There's a supermarket open late on Gold Street, a block towards Fulton Street, and very well stocked. However, it was totally upstaged by 55 Fulton Market, a newly refurbished supermarket and deli, open 24 hours daily with such a good product selection as well as a fab deli counter, hot food and salad bar, even a sushi chef. There are some tables and chairs just by the cash register and some outside too. I want to live opposite such a good place! I have googled it since returning and it was, apparently, refurbished less than 2 months ago. Staff were also friendly and said all the food was cooked from scratch in the kitchens upstairs; they had a real pride in the place.Boy, did I sleep well both nights. After pounding the pavements of Manhattan, walking on the Saturday right the way up to Central Park South in baking hot sunshine with lots of side distractions en route, I was fairly tired, but an excellent quality bed and nice pillows sent me straight off to the land of nod! Air con was easily controllable so I did not have to endure icy blasts that are so popular on your (very nice) side of the Atlantic.DId I like the place? Oh, yes. Would I stay there again? Most definitely. Would I stay there rather than midtown or uptown? Absolutely, since from where else can you walk over the Brooklyn Bridge (and see a Tree grow in Brooklyn, literally), hit Century 21 (which I didn't actually like), get onto the Staten Island Ferry and pretend you are Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl, be so close to that Frank Gehry skyscraper (which is my favourite building in the world for making titanium look so organic and draped!), be in part of the most historic area of the city, small old synagogues and churches snuggling up next to skyscrapers, and be so close to subway lines at Fulton Street that go everywhere (even, if like me, you preferred Shanks's pony)?Loved it!","London, United Kingdom","londonraffles1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",15,5.0

The rooms are incredibly quite and the rooms decor, structure are clever and well thought out. Somewhere between art deco, industrial progressive,and steampunk. It is not easily categorized. This is a hidden gem. They often have excellent discounts as well from various hotel booking groups. Nonetheless, not a tourist sink.

I thought from the photos of this property it would be fun, hip and different. The hotel is on a dark street with very little daylight. The lobby and bar are very attractive. I agree with the other reviewer that the front desk was just ok. Not rude but not warm either. The red hallways make you think this is going to be great but it's not. Small room with window looking into another persons apt. The room was dark and musty. My husband sat at the desk to check emails and I had to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room. The bathroom was bright and clean looking, really didn't match the room. Why wouldn't you get soap or shower gel? We used the directions from the desk and took the subway which was a mistake it was having issues and several trains worth of people waiting to board. We were late for our dinner reservations. If you need to stay in the Financial District for business that is one thing but don't stay here if you want to see other parts of the city. Too far. The bar is nice to have a drink before retiring. Didn't venture up to the second floor libaray area until leaving. Nicer spot to sit and relax. Might have been nice to know about before hand from the front desk. We did not have a good night sleep because of the air conditioning, on and really cold, off and the musty smell again. Our key card didn't work in the room, my car didn't work in the elevator.

The photos and website showed a hotel I would like. Unfortunately for us it was not so great. When we checked in around midnight, we were given a king room which majorly reeked of cigarette smoke (the whole 2nd floor did). So I went down and asked for a non-smoking room. The nonchalant English desk clerk said he may have one other room available and then brought us the key to a 5th floor double room, which was fine with us. Upon our entry we thought the room was a bit muggy and the thermostat, which was set at 72 read 76 room temp. But we stayed thinking this was better than the smoky room and reset the thermo to 65 hoping it would get cooler overnight - and we were really tired by this time (plus apparently we had the last available room). In the night the hall light would come on and go off arbitrarily (this was something I had read as a complaint on other reviews on booking.com and was surprised that it was still a problem). And worse, the temp continued to rise in the room. It was hot, damp (it had recently rained) and had no air movement at all. It was impossible to sleep and the room smelled so musty and gross. By morning it was 78 degrees.I went to the desk at 6am to tell them and the desk clerk only offered me a late check out and to send an engineer (why do we want an engineer when we are checking out?). While I loved the decor of the hotel and the soft beds, these problems and the lack of any offering of reduction for the price we paid for the room was too much to be able to give this hotel anything better than a bad rating. The hotel sent me a survey which I completed referencing this problem and also asked for a response, and I separately sent the hotel corporate office an email. I have not had a communication from either. I think if my AC had been operational my review would have been really good, but that was not the case.

Usually I book a room via Hotwire or Priceline and often get a great deal. That's how I ended up at Gild Hall.There were a lot of positives to this hotel. First, it's 2 blocks from the subway in a very safe neighborhood. The room I has was very large by New York standards. I particularly like the quirky decor of the lobby, guest rooms and common areas. I think by far, the best part of this hotel is it's staff. To a person, everyone was super friendly and helpful. I felt less like I was staying in a hotel and more like I was staying in some private club. The staff just made me feel welcome. If you go to a larger midtown hotel, I promise you, that's hard to find. Before I forget, I loved the prosecco at check in -- it was a really nice touch.That said, there were some negatives, but just a few. First, the guest room was super dark. I mean, there was no natural light. Part of that is the Financial District location, but most of that is the hotel's design. If that's important to you, don't stay here.Also, I was there on a Saturday morning and they only offered a continental breakfast in the bar for $15. I skipped it and had a full diner breakfast around the corner at the Pearl St. Diner for less than that. I honestly don't think you can be considered a 4 star hotel if you don't serve breakfast, but somehow, Gild Hall pulls it off. If a weekend breakfast is important to you, don't stay here. (I think it would be smarter for the management to offer this continental breakfast free on the weekends, but that's just me.) I also had a technical glitch with my TV -- something about the cable connection meant the audio wasn't quite right. It wasn't enough to complain about, but that and a few housekeeping details -- like a missing bar of soap -- made me think that the very pleasant team needed a bit of work.Despite these hiccups, I would return, mainly because of the friendly staff, the good price and a convenient to the subway location.","Yufu, Japan","Trav3lm0re</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yufu, Japan</strong>",28,4.0

Yet again (somewhat) another case where the product (The hotel) is pretty decent but the Service doesn't follow through.The Lobby and bar are absolutely beautiful. I had a Premium Room that, to be honest, looked quite average to me. I had tried another Thompson before (in Tribeca) and the rooms were superior. The size was adequate though. Even though I was on the highest floor (room 181), the view was average. I lucked out I got it at a discounted price (about $210 a night?). Had I paid full price I would have been seriously disappointed.I felt that the ambiance (music etc) around the end of PM/evening was great. even more welcoming that the Tribeca sister (too trendy sometimes?). But otherwise the hotel felt a bit deserted at timesThe worst part was the reception. Even for NYC it felt cold. You almost have the impression you annoy them. To be fair not all the people were that cold, but it's more miss than hit. Typical example: we come out around 7:30AM from the elevators right in front of the lobby, walk by 3 people who are too busy having fun between them to say Hi, we go all the way to the restaurant, one of them sees us standing there for a solid 3-4 min (no one comes by) and doesn't intervene. I go to the reception just to hear the guy tell us that their breakfast doesn't open until later on WE. I wish he had told me that before. Not big things but seriously not what you would expect in a Thompson hotel. We had a few similar incidents. Each one not annoying enough but all of them add up.We tried the breakfast once. Average at best. Don't go out of your way to try it.On the plus side: the area is not as deserted as I thought it would be. I wouldn't return again unless it was on discount.

The bar in the lobby (The Libertine) was comfortable, and there is an upstairs lounge above the bar, which was a nice option.

Stayed at Gild Hall with a friend. While I can't say it was a horrible stay, the room is lovely, just like the pics. The hotel decor is great. I just think the staff needs more training on how to be consistent. My friend arrived before me, she checked in, then I arrived 2 hours later. Neither of us were offered a glass of Prosecco, as I observed other guests were, the next day, but to be fair, this was a totally different staff checking in the newly arrived :-(. No coffee available, unless you walk a short distance to Starbucks, which isn't bad, however, when you're hungover you really just want it at your fingertips (don't judge). The next day the cleaning person only left one wash towel?? We called down and it took over an hour to get another. If you are use to getting body lotion, shower gel, shampoo & conditioner, bring your own lotion & shower gel, these are not provided. I liked the location, the cab drivers did not, but it was quiet, and not hard to walk to. There isn't weekend room service, but it's New York, you can easily, walk out the door, turn the corner and right up the street is a wonderful restaurant & gourmet grocery. In all it's not a kid friendly hotel, and since I don't have any that was fine by me. Its is a boutique hotel, whatever that means.

My husband and I had a very pleasant stay at the Gild Hall over the past weekend. The location is great, tucked away in one of the maze of little streets in that part of the city, and really close to several subway lines. If, like me, you are a runner, you have easy access to some great routes (Battery Park, Hudson River Park, Brooklyn Bridge). If, like me, you are a shopper, you are close to Century 21 and a short walk from the Tribeca and SoHo shops between West Broadway and Broadway. (Tip: SoHo gets very crowded by 2 PM - most shops open at 11 AM on Saturdays so aim to go between 11 and 2 if you want to avoid the crowds).The room we had was well-appointed and on a high floor so far enough away from street noise, although this area seems pretty quiet at the weekend.The hotel bar was chocker with the after-work crowd on the Friday but very quiet on the Saturday. The only disappointment was the breakfast. The restaurant is closed at weekends so there is a continental breakfast buffet only. Not very good value or quality.

It was close to the subway for trips uptown, but also close to the 911 Memorial, Wall St, the Staten Is Ferry, Seaport and Brooklyn. There were a few bars and restaurants close, but it was also easy to jump in a cab to go a little farther afield if you want. There is also a supermarket and laundry next door. Part of our stay was over the weekend when the Financial District is very quiet. This was great for walking around without the crowds but no so good for nightlife, On one occasion I had arranged to meet friends for drinks at the hotel but found that the barman had failed to turn up for work, however on our return later that evening we found that someone had been called in. The decor itself is very eclectic and fabulous, from the red painted halls with Hollywood 60""s photo's, to the wood paneled library and bar. The room was also quite large for NYC, the bed very comfortable and the bathroom and amenities very good. The only thing that I would have liked included was free wifi, which I think is expected in a hotel of this standard.

Bad idea. Because when I tried to redeem it, they told me they were out of the ""class"" of rooms that were on the coupon for the date I wanted. The coupon offered two upgrades for the price, so I told them I would be happy to take a lower grade room. They were happy to book me in a lower grade room. But for a HIGHER PRICE. Then I asked them what rooms they had available. They told me they only had premium rooms. That was the room grade on the coupon. When I told them that, they said they didn't have those available, they only had suites available. Then I asked them why they were offering me a lower grade room. They kept changing the story. I should have took the hint and booked somewhere else, but I went ahead and paid the extra money.Mind you, I was supposed to get free WiFi and free continental breakfast with the coupon, but since I got the LOWER GRADE room for a HIGHER PRICE, they were not going to honor the coupon. So I called Travelzoo and got a refund.When I got to the hotel, they were nice enough and the hotel was pretty and the decorations were nice. However. The room was just ok. First thing. Why didn't they have a top sheet? That is just unsanitary. Who knows if they wash those comforters every day. Second. There is no coffee maker in the room. If you want your morning cup of joe, you better be prepared to go downstairs and pay a full $15.00 for their continental breakfast, which consists of some cereal, a little fruit, a few danishes and some juice. And coffee. I just wanted the coffee. So I grabbed a cup and went upstairs to my room. I didn't pay for it, figured it was the least they could give me.Last, but certainly not least, they have NO RESTAURANT ON THE WEEKENDS. Who closes their restaurant on weekends? I was looking forward to a night in with some delicious four star food. Room service? Nope. They brought up some menus. One of the places was closed already and it was only 8pm. ??!! We eventually ordered from grubhub. I wanted room service because I wanted china and real utensils and a decent meal.I will never go to this place again. Ever.

While I enjoyed the quietness of Gild Hall vs other financial district hotesl that are near the WTC construction site, I was disappointed in little things missing that would have made my stay more enjoyable, amenities I have grown used to having even in economy hotels. First off, there are no down pillows, I spent the entire night trying to get comfortable on a styrofoam filled pillow. Secondly, there are no inroom coffee makers. Additionally, there are no inroom irons/ironing boards, almost a necessity when trying to press a suit that has traveled in your small carryon luggage.","Santa Rosa Beach, Florida","MiltonMan007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Rosa Beach, Florida</strong>",84,3.0

The hotel is effectively shut at the weekend, so all they are selling you is a bedroom (at not inconsiderable cost). As always at the Gild Hall, the room was nice - comfortably and fashionably furnished is a sort of 'leather and dark wood generic American boutique hotel' sort of way; not imaginative - just that sort of US Luxe look that you see on makeover shows. It's cute that they provide an in-house magazine worth reading - but frankly I'd rather they actually OPENED the hotel properly at the weekend. They don't provide breakfast (unless you count a mount of cheap muffins and other sugar-based substances as 'breakfast'. It's 'continental only' at the weekend - served casually on a table in an un-lit corner of the bar / reception area). Frankly, it's depressing. You're made to feel like you are staying over in a boarding school after everyone else has left. To get a hot breakfast i had to go find a local diner - OK for what it was, but after spending to be in a luxurious hotel, don't expect to breakfast in a diner with the hobos. There's no room service either (the front desk provided takeaway menus, which was kind of them, but again not really a solution). The worst element is that (presumably in order to save electricity / the planet) they only light a tiny part of the reception area - leaving the (shut) ground floor / first floor bars and the restaurant in darkness - which adds to the feeling that you're not welcome. In it's favour, it's close to Fulton Street subway, and Century 21, the location has atmosphere and it's not that expensive. But Thompson Hotels big themselves up as the coolest thing since sliced bread. This place lacks the fundamental hospitality I expect of a hotel, anywhere in the world at any time of the week. It's NOT MY FAULT it's the weekend. If they don't want to run a hotel at the weekend they should just shut down Friday thru Sunday. Never again.","London, United Kingdom","Brett T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",49,1.0

[food was nice and not expensive, the barman even put the football on the TV for us]. For some nice bars try Stone Street, about a 5 minute walk!Most beers are $5-$8 (included imported and 'fancy' beers - such as white beers], wine is more $9-$11 a glass, and that's the cheap stuff.Breakfast at the hotel wasn't great, we had pre-paid for their continental breakfast at $15 per person per day, but for that all you had was 1 piece of toast and jam and a small serving of fresh fruit, your $15 (£10) did not included tea/coffee/juice [approx $5 each] or service charge at 18% - so even though we had pre-paid for our breakfast(which was a meager portion for $60 per day for 4 of us - approx £40) we were then presented with a bill for almost $16 (just over £10) for bringing us 4 slices of toast and fruit![On Sunday - there was nobody working the kitchen and we helped ourselves from a selection in the bar area, there was no service charge and we took as much as we wanted - much better idea!]After Monday morning, we found an excellent deli around the corner 'Lane's Deli' where the owner (Gabe) and his staff offered an excellent breakfast, a huge selection and great prices - we had our fill of toast, bacon, eggs, juice and tea for around $7-$8 each [£5], for the rest of our stay we cut our losses with the continental breakfast at the hotel and ate there! [they also had a huge choice for lunches and dinners and the food was great and cheap!][they will even do you a packed lunch to take out for the day].Taxis : We arrived at JFK and straight away someone tried to scam us with a fixed taxi fare of $68 to take us to our hotel in lower Manhattan! Make sure you ONLY get a taxi off the rank - the flat rate to any hotel/location is $45 + tolls [approx $6] - we paid $51 for our journey which took about 45 mins. When we returned to the airport on Wednesday we paid just $45 flat rate as the tolls are only one-way [we left in evening rush hour and it took 1hr 20 mins - allow plenty of time]. You don't have to agree a price, it's all on the meter. Also, whilst at the hotel the doorman got us a taxi one evening, when we arrived at our destination the driver added $4 onto the cost of our $8 journey, because the doorman had taken a ride from the main road back to our hotel and not paid the driver [annoying!] - moral: get your own taxi, there's loads around.Trains : we purchased a metrocard which gives unlimited train, underground and bus travel for 7 days for $29 [£20], the underground [subway] was easy to use. Make sure you get a streetmap at the hotel, it is really simple to use and you can find your nearest subway station from various attractions.Attractions: Arrive early - and avoid the queues, a New York CityPass is a money saving idea, we purchased ours online before we travelled and they cost £52 each - we used ours to see Empire State Building, Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island Ferry Trip, Museum of Natural History, Metropolitan Museum, Museum of Modern Art and we ran out of time but could have gone to the observation deck of the Rockerfeller Building.People: are amazingly friendly and helpful - every time we pulled out our map someone would stop and ask if we needed help or where we were looking to go.Would I go back to NY? - yes definitelyWould I stay at this hotel again? - probably not, I'd go somewhere more uptown!","Hemel Hempstead, England, United Kingdom","Rochelle L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hemel Hempstead, England, United Kingdom</strong>",15,2.0

I was fully aware of the location and know manhattan hotels very well. The room is very nice no complaints there. The bed is comfy, the tv is big, bathroom is excellent, the decor is unique in a good way. But, these details alone would never make a hotel a 4 star in any city. There was no bell on saturday night to get a cab and a cab would likely never drive by the hotel so this is unacceptable to ever leave the hotel without proper staff unless of course you were not trying to be 4 star. There is no bar or restaurant in the hotel on weekends. No room service. No coffee maker or coffee anywhere in the hotel. No iron to iron your clothes. No conceirge to help you choose somewhere to eat which is obviously necessary downtown because its not the type of neighborhood you can just wander around and hope you find something. Most of the financial district shuts down on weekends so the hotel has to at least try to be educated on this. I knew all of this about financial district before hand but did not expect a 4 star hotel to be this clueless and literally have 0 service. The front desk is nice but they do not qualify to be a conceirge by handing a list of restaurants with no descriptons. The doors closing are extremely loud and obnoxious to the point where you will not be able to sleep past 10 am. House keeping does not care if you put do not disturb sign up they will most certaintly come knock every 20 minutes starting at 9am.I am being very detailed in my complaints because of this hotel being advertised as 4 star here and priceline.

Otherwise, under the hotel's ""European-style"" bedding, nothing will separate your comforter from the bottom sheet and mattress.In December 2011, I stayed two weekday nights at Gild Hall. This represented my second visit. Shortly before I initially visited Gild Hall more than a year ago, Thompson Hotels had taken over and renovated the property. Hotel occupancy rates were depressed, and management seemed willing to please. Upon my second visit, the bloom somewhat had faded.Gild Hall offers a convenient location for those wanting or needing to stay in the heart of Manhattan's financial district. The hotel's also convenient to various subway stops, rendering other parts of metropolitan New York easily accessible. My room's HVAC worked reasonably well, providing either heating or cooling depending on needs.Paying $364 per night despite having reserved many months in advance, I was disappointed that the bedding included no top sheet. Having only a comforter to cover me disrupted my sleep. Upon checking out of the hotel I mentioned that I would've appreciated having a top sheet. The front desk responded that Gild Hall features ""European-style"" bedding but would've provided a top sheet had I requested one. In this traveler's opinion, Gild Hall should prioritize providing travelers restful sleep over honoring any particular bedding ""style."" For the room rate I was paying, it seems reasonable to expect the bed to include both top and bottom sheeting. I noted some additional shortcomings. Most of the times I showered in my room, I had difficulty obtaining sufficiently warm water. It was also disappointing that the clock radio in my room provided no access to a.m. radio stations. Some terrific, iconic a.m. stations broadcast in the New York area; I missed not hearing them during my visit.I appreciated that Gild Hall provides on three different floors (6, 7, and 18) areas for exercising. However, all three workout areas proved small and limited, apparently shoehorned into former closets. Each area provided only two machines: a treadmill and a stair stepper. In the area closest to my room (floor 18), I while running on the treadmill could not activate the accompanying television's sound system. Travelers seeking more intense indoor workouts should arrange in advance to visit one of the financial district's extensively appointed (although not inexpensive) health clubs. When again needing to stay in Manhattan's financial district, I would consider returning to Gild Hall.

The hotel is ideally situated for the Financial District and only a short walk form Ground Zero, Broadway and the subway system. There is a choice of restaurants, bars and food shops nearby, so eating well is not a problem. The room was spacious and spotlessly clean, the towels and linen were of superior quality and the mini bar was well stocked with good products.The hotel is designed to look and feel like a gentleman's club and the library on the second floor was a great place to sit and relax. The bar looked welcoming and the restaurant, although I never sampled it's fare, looked to be of high qualityI found the staff to be friendly, professional, very helpful and welcoming at all times.Would I go back a second time?

It met all our expectations. That is, it is a small, clean, well-priced hotel close to Ground Zero and the Financial District. I read earlier reviews posted here, and the fact that the bathroom door is semi-opaque and there's no restaurant weren't relevant to us. (There are plenty of eateries in the area, including Les Halles, where we had a delectable brunch.) Back to Gild Hall: We were delighted that a room was available when we arrived, even though it was 11:30 am. Every member of the hotel's staff was friendly, professional, and helpful. One caveat: If you drive to NYC, do not valet park your car. It's vastly overpriced. (I was told it was about $55 per 24-hour period, and if we went over the 24 hours, it would be another $55.) Instead, go to the parking garage up the street, which was much cheaper for a stay of more than 24 hours. Oh, and check out your room's minibar. In addition to prosaic offerings, like soda and candy, there are condoms and what appeared to be discreetly wrapped sex toys.","Wynnewood, Pennsylvania","screenstarr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wynnewood, Pennsylvania</strong>",11,4.0

I found the front lobby really nice, the room was clean (and spacious for NYC standards), the furnishings were modern, staff was really friendly/helpful and it was nice and quiet in the evening in the rooms (although the downstairs bar looked pretty busy). A couple of friends said they didn't think it was a good idea to get a hotel in the financial district over the weekend since not much would be happening... I actually thought the opposite. It takes a quick subway/taxi ride to get wherever you want to be, and you get the benefit of some peace and quiet when you return home late at night.Would definitely recommend this placeOnly criticism: I would say it's more of a criticism on Kayak's part, it said that a. there was a 24 hour cancellation policy (when in fact, if you purchased one of the special rates, you were charged up front and not allowed a refund) and b. breakfast would be included. While breakfast is included for some guest packages, it wasn't included for us which was what Kayak stated. Again...I think it's a Kayak issue, but something to consider when booking.

Basically, pretend this place doesn't have a restaurant and your expectations will be more in line with the service provided. The parking is an utter debacle, we wound up being billed twice for parking, and having to park ourselves despite the alleged presence of a ""valet."" While the front desk staff was very nice and helpful when they were around, it also didn't appear to be a real 24 hour front desk. For example, when we showed up at 6am, the man in the parking garage told us that (a) the front desk had to call to get our car, and (b) the front desk staff was unavailable and (c) he knew they would be unavailable, because they were never available this early. He suggested we visit their break room. This is just silly. A final point - the heat did not work properly in our room. It was a frigid 68 degrees, even after someone came to ""fix"" the heat. When we told the staff on checkout that we found this unacceptable, no discount was offered -- not even after it was revealed they'd double-billed us for parking.

Needless to say, we have been to many hotels located in Manhattan. However, Gild Hall was the by far the best! I have been to $600+ a night hotels and not always impressed.

We were very happy with the overall appearance of the hotel.However, there were more than a few things that really turned this trip into a disaster.During check-in, the woman's cellular phone rang. This was a little surprising and really threw off our expectations of this hotel. I'm not sure if it's normal to have your cellular phone with you at reception but this has never happened to me before anywhere else. I later asked one of the gentlemen bellhops (who were very helpful in fetching cabs and attending to bags) if this was normal and they said that she was the manager. What's next was even more surprising to me and my husband. For some reason 3 out of the 5 times we visited the desk, the girls were barefoot!! I'm not sure if it's because their feet hurt in the shoes or what but this was extremely unpleasant to the eyes, I'm definitely sure this isn't normal uniform policy.Lastly, the Libertine restaurant. While they actually have good food. The service was terrible! The waitress would disappear into a room behind a closet and we would have to wait for her to come out to order something or get a check. It took exceptionally long for us to receive our food, about 45 minutes for a hamburger. Later in the night the restaurant turned into a club and I was told I had to go around the side of the hotel to go back into the bar for a drink by a large bouncer in the middle of the lobby. I wish I could have enjoyed my stay more and left a better review. But there are some service failures here that I could not overlook.

That being said, once we found the hotel our overall experience was great - the gentlemen at the front desk and dealing with the cars were all exceptionally polite and friendly. For example, When we asked for a map, they offered to recommend sites or routes to walk around. Our room itself was nice - very masculine finishes with a leather headboard with buckle details and a black/grey theme in bathroom. My two main gripes - the bathroom, while well appointed had a few minor frustrations. First, there is no bathroom fan. This can be less than ideal for showering as it results in an overly steamy bathroom but also, and this might seem funny, but there is a certain degree of privacy afforded by the bathroom fan. Especially when the bathroom and the 'living space' is less than 5 feet away from one another. The bathroom door itself also didn't close very well and had 'ribbed' glass so my fiance laughed that he could see me through it. Finally, the fancy design of the shelves didn't really allow toiletry bags to fit properly and the sink was a pedestal design which didn't help with storage either.Secondly, for a rather refined hotel, the connecting restaurant, Libertine, was a major disappointment. We received a voucher for 20% off and even so felt we grossly overpaid for substandard food. Several things we asked for were unavailable that evening, including french fries and a few appetizers. Because we were on a 'splurge trip' we got dessert despite a fairly disappointing meal and the sorbets were half melted, which our server pointed out by saying 'yeah they are kind of melted but you have spoons..."" The restaurant also felt fairly run down - the sticky bar feeling that I associate with university days rather than a NYC hotel.Overall, would stay there again happily if I planned my meals better beforehand.

We looked up on the internet which hotel to stay in the city. My girlfriend picked Gild Hall because she thought it must be nice if it was located in ""Financial District"". I was skeptical but she was right! The great service started as soon as the cab pulled up at the front entrance of the hotel. Check in was fast and simple as if they new it was us as when the cab pulled up. The hotel manager, Benjamin Chan (if i remember correctly) knew what he was doing. He knew all the places to get the NEW YORK FOOD that locals rave about, even restaurants in Queens. Everyone was professional just the way i like it. NICELY DRESSED and courteous. Pretty much everyone was in a suit and tie and NOT sloppy. That's one of my pet peeves. You can't just have a nice suit (especially one that doesn't fit) but you also have to look good!. Nicely decorated rooms,very clean and everything was operable. Actually one of the elevator went out of service as my girlfriend and I were going to Megu(which recommend if you want the best quality of beef) but on our way back to the hotel, it was already fixed! I was in the Marines for four years and now I'm a successful designer and I worked hard my whole life; I want what I spend to be worth it and everything perfect. Gild hall did the job and I recommend it to anyone who knows and appreciates quality. Note: When we headed out to go to the concert(which was AWESOME!), my girlfriend wanted to experience the NYC subway system. Again, the manager came to the rescue! He gave us the best way to get to the stadium with added information on the area and how the subway works!","Pasadena, California","Terry K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pasadena, California</strong>",1,5.0

I'm almost hesitant to write this review for fear driving the rates up! We travel to the city for weekend trips fairly regularly and Gild Hall, while not conveniently located for those wishing to waltz out of the front doors into the bustle of Times Square, is fantastic. Spacious rooms, helpful staff, very clean rooms and amazingly quiet because the financial district is a relative ghost town on the weekends with narrow little streets that taxi drivers hate, let alone buses and trucks. The decor is decidedly masculine but understated and the accommodations are always very well cleaned. My only complaint is the lack of free WIFI. Our most recent trip to the city turned out to be a terrible ordeal involving a broken car, an almost missed meeting and a terrible meal to top it all off.

The hotel is definitely a boutique, which I like. I get bored with the ""standard"" hotel feel sometimes and look forward to the surprise of a boutique. The lobby is well appointed with an adjoining restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner. (We have had breakfast a few times in the restaurant - it's pretty slow - so if you're in a hurry you may want to opt for another venue.) In the evening, the restaurant turns into a hopping bar scene. I was really surprised because it's so sleepy during the day. Not bad, however, it added a nice vibe when walking into the lobby in the evening. The staff is always very helpful and the service has been great. The rooms are comfortable and well decorated. I love the ""buckle"" detail on the leather headboards. I was surprised at how spacious the rooms were - especially for NYC. The bathroom is tiny, however. It's a ""one person"" space. But . . . with very nice detail. I thought the glass door separating the main room from the bathroom was very posh. However, I read some reviews where others said they didn't like it. I had a king size room both times I've stayed. Both rooms were directly off the elevator and I think they're a bit larger. I was worried about it being loud due to the close proximity of the elevators - but trust me - I heard nothing. Not even the ""all night noise"" that is typical in NYC. Maybe it's because my room faces into another building - very close! Just keep your blinds closed and you'll be fine. There's plenty of drawer and closet space and a neat mini bar area. The only negative (besides the slow service in the kitchen) is that both times I stayed at the hotel my room keys (all 3) became demagnitized almost daily. I swear I didn't have them next to my cell phone. I had to go to the front desk often to have them rekeyed. If you want to workout I'd recommend Crunch Fitness. It's two blocks away. They charge $15/day if you show you hotel key. Also, for awesome, healthy food - try Energy Kitchen. Also just a few blocks away. Nothing is over 500 calories. They open at 7:30am for breakfast, too.

Reception greeting was a smileless hello. Later sat at the bar to have a glass of champagne, 3 people at front desk (hotel is small, bar is right next to reception area) saw us sitting at bar where there was no staff and no one acknowledged us. After 10 minutes bartender comes out and she was actually really nice and helpful, giving us suggestions for dinner and manicures. Next day at check out we spot what appeared to be a complimentary continental breakfast (self service set up with the usual pastries and yogurt) was set up in bar area, so we walk over and proceed to fill a bowl with yogurt...and again, no one was staffed there. Then out nowhere someone comes out and informs us that costs $15, so we put down our bowls, not yet touched and said sorry we don't want it. She says, 'oh ok, I guess I will throw it out.' Um, don't put food out w/ no signage if no one is working, otherwise this will happen, as I am sure it's not the first time.

Gild Hall exceeded our expectations - the only thing lacking was the dining service/areas and lack of free internet, described below, which resulted in a 4-star review rather than 5-stars.Location: A little hard to find, but as long as you know that the main entrance isn't actually on Gold Street, you'll be fine. Most cabbies had no problem getting us back to the hotel after nights on the town once we said it was across the street from Harry's Italian restaurant (GREAT pizza and open late, by the way) and two blocks from the Seaport. The subway is just one block away from the hotel, a gourmet food/convenience store is located a few doors down, and there's a Starbucks less than a block away. For us, it was the perfect locale, in an area with numerous restaurants/shops, sans the crowds, near both the subway and a quick 5-minute walk to the Seaport.Design: The design of this hotel is perfect; the interior looks like a cross between a cushy boutique and the library of a mountain lodge. The staff is well-trained and attentive. We never saw the person providing daily maid service to our room the entire time we were there, but no matter what odd hour we departed/returned our room was made and there was fresh ice. The bedding was comfortable, the room was fair-sized for a hotel room in the city, and there was plenty of storage space. The bathroom had a shower only, but the fixtures were attractive, clean, and modern. The only thing I'd change about the room setup is that the entire wall between the bedroom and bathroom is frosted glass - in other words, if someone is using the restroom and you're in the bedroom, you can see (almost completely) and hear through the bathroom's opaque wall, offering VERY little privacy. The hotel boasts a second floor bar, but we never ventured there. When we returned from our nights out, we entered the lobby (which is partially open to the 2nd floor bar area staircase) and were greeted by deafening Top 40 music selections. The guests we saw staying at this hotel ranged in age from mid-40s to late 60s; in general, not the type of clientele who appreciate top 40 music and certainly not music blared so loud that conversation is difficult just one floor below. On the up side, we couldn't hear the music from our room on the 12th floor. On the down side, we did not - at all - entertain the idea of checking out the bar for an after-dinner drink.Food service: There is no room service, but the hotel has a small restaurant open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We ate breakfast in the hotel the first morning after we arrived. The restaurant had 2 customers when we came downstairs at 8:30 AM, but we waited almost 10 minutes to be seated. Our waitress brought out the wrong food twice; she did not write our order down and the cook ended up coming out himself to take our order. In all, it took almost an hour from the time we ordered to get two correct omelets delivered to our table, one with ham and cheese, one with mushroom and spinach. The food was delicious, but the waitress was definitely sub-par. We spoke to the registration desk and they immediately removed the breakfast charges from our bill; the very apologetic and very efficient customer service desk absolutely made up for the annoyance of breakfast, but we didn't eat another meal in the hotel during our visit.Additionally, if you plan to work at all when you arrive at the hotel, keep in mind that you'll have to pony up $9.99/day for internet service. We opted for our cell phones and free internet at Starbucks on the two occasions we needed access during our trip.Even with the minor annoyances, we will likely stay at Gild Hall again. I never would have imagined that you could walk out of a hotel in NYC at midnight and feel like you're in an abandoned city. The location is ultra-quiet, free of crowds, the decor is fabulous and the hotel is kept exceptionally clean, the customer service is outstanding (one waitress aside) and it's a wonderful jumping-off point for whatever you might be planning to do in any section of the city.","Trenton, Florida","MouseFanatic</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Trenton, Florida</strong>",82,4.0

While some fine its quirkiness to be charming, we found it to be disappointing. First of all, we were not greeted with the promised glass of Preseco, nor were we informed about any amenities. We did not receive a daily newspaper as promised. We found the rooms to be small, and the lack of a dresser or a place to put folded clothing was annoying. There was no iron in the room or stand to hold a suitcase (which we had to keep out to hold our folded clothes!) The transparent sliding doors to the bathroom do not offer alot of privacy...and I would NOT recommend sharing a room with anyone you did not want to see what your bathroom habits are. We were surprised to find there was no coffee making in the room or available in the lobby. The only option was to purchase a carafe from room service for $8.00 with a $7.00 delivery fee. No soda machine in the building.Finally, the bed is made without a top sheet. You have only a duvet and a bottom sheet. I truly doubt the duvet is washed with each customer, so that really add to the ""ugh"" factor. I did get a top sheet on request - I was told the lack of top sheet is a ""European"" custom. THE LACK OF AMENITIES MAKE THIS NOT WORTH THE COST.","Fredericksburg, Virginia","nscharf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fredericksburg, Virginia</strong>",1,2.0

At Gild Hall, a boutique hotel, allows me to forget that space is an issue.Booked a king bed on the 5th floor and would return on my next visit. Here's why:+ The room is pretty big. I had a king bed and it fit the bed without my having to skirt around it. Plenty of room to lay out luggage, get dressed, and just move around in general.+ Bathroom is pretty modern and clean. Great water pressure. Slip into the Frette robe and wash up.+ Flatscreen TV, desk, window seats, are all part of the room+ Don't like ""gym"" then Crunch Fitness is only $10. I didn't use Crunch since I just needed a treadmill. ""Gym"" is in a small space that fits just that, a treadmill, a stairmaster, handheld weights and a bench. There is a water cooler and an air conditioner. Super basic.+ Shelves by the doorway to throw your purchases, keys, etc. That came in handy.+ Great library in the lobby area. Esconce yourself in a leather space and read up.+ Great bed.+ Nice reception and doormen.And the not so +'s:- It's in Financial District. Not know for nightlife. But it is close to the Fulton St station which may be convenient but its weekend schedule sometimes means you have to go to another further station to make it.- Walls seem thin. I heard guests traipse down the hallway and sometimes even my neighbor. I can filter a lot out but it was a little annoying.Overall great accomodations.

I'm a NYC resident who, after a catastrophe at my apartment, was pleasantly surprised by the warm service I received at Gild Hall. I booked online through Priceline so I was not expecting much when I arrived a little disheveled from my day. The young lady who checked me in was extremely pleasant and very empathetic when she asked as to the reason for my stay. I was given a room on the 11th floor, which was a smoking floor. I was a little hesitant when I stepped off the elevator as I did not want to get into a room that smelled of an ashtray. However, the room was spotless and did not smell one bit of smoke. The room was also very large by NYC standards. I believe I was put into a Deluxe King, so a slight upgrade.Due to my situation of not knowing when my apartment would be ready again, I resorted to booking an extra night a few days for a total of 4 nights. Since I did each through Priceline, I had to go down to the desk to do a quick check-in process each time, but every person I dealt with was exceptionally friendly. Housekeeping was also extremely efficient. I left the hotel late a couple days (I work from home) after a couple knocks on the door from housekeeping and expected to return later to find that my room had yet to be serviced, but was pleasantly surprised each time. I think I may have had to call down once, but it was clean within an hour of my request. The only qualm I had was that I use multiple devices to connect to the internet, and Gild Hall charges for WiFi access.

I'll try to distill a long story into a few salient items.1) The building's HVAC system is set up so that only air or heat will work at one time - i.e. the building needs to switch to heat downstairs in the boiler room. Well think about the Fall when it's warm during the day and cool at night - since the hotel was still set up for A/C there was NO HEAT! And no way to get any heat. Shivering in the room...2) Service is poor for a hotel of this standard. Was treated curtly by just about everyone.3) Rooms are a disappointment - they have a few interesting touches, but a lot of empty white walls to stare at. Felt like I was in a big white box. Very uncomfortable.4) No taxis available -- some others have commented on this and said it was no big deal you just walk 2-3 blocks. Well imagine doing that in a pouring rainstorm or a snowstorm?

We read in one of the reviews that the closest subway stop is closed, and we did see one Fulton St. entrance that is closed, but there are other entrances that are just a few blocks away from the hotel. - Rooms are very nicely appointed and elegant. Our view from the 16th floor still looked right into another apartment building, but it was fine. Bed was very comfortable, decor was nice, fair amount of space. We were concerned about the semi-transparent bathroom wall thing, but it was really a non-issue. You can't really see a thing.- Price was right!! We booked a superior king room for $215/night (on hotelbook.com) for Labor Day weekend. Where else can you find reasonable rates AND quality in NYC??Cons:- Location is a little out of the way, and nothing nearby is open late, but if you've read the reviews and looked at a map, you should be expecting this. And on the plus side, it is much, much quieter than staying somewhere close to the sights.- The complimentary continental breakfast was a little pitiful. Sad selection and zero table service (couldn't find a napkin, glass of water, or server anywhere in sight). Skip!! - Housekeeping was a little sloppy. We had a couple towels that didn't look very clean, and the soap dish was dirty when we arrived. Not a big deal, but not up to the standard I would have expected, given the rest of the hotel.- Charging $10/day for the internet, esp in the business district, is lame. - No iron in the room - again, for a business district hotel, lame.A note on bedbugs: there are none here, at least as far as we could tell. I checked bedbugregistry.com before we went, and someone had written that they had seen bedbugs in their bathroom at this hotel. I was really worried about this and read tripadvisor reviews obsessively to see if anyone had commented on this, but no one had. When we checked in, my husband and I stripped the bed - checked the comforter, sheets, and mattress, and didn't see anything. We stayed two nights and have been home for a week and don't seem to have brought back any travelers with us. *Whew* I was VERY concerned about this. I told the front desk when we were checking out that I had read about a bedbug complaint online, and he said a few weeks ago, one guest did complain about bedbugs and that they sent up staff to check it out but didn't find anything (or did he say that there might have been bugs, but they were not bedbugs?). I recommended that the hotel dispute the complaint on bedbugregistry.com if it had been determined to be untrue, but he didn't seem too concerned. Anyway, I'm sure plenty of hotels deny any type of bedbug problem, so I appreciated that he was honest about someone reporting it. Just wanted to put this out there, in case anyone else is as paranoid as me! :) Overall, the next time we're in NYC, we would stay here again.

We know our way around the City well enough not to be intimidated by staying so far Downtown, in the Financial district, and so we decided to try the Gild Hotel. The weeKend rate was under $200, which is always a pleasant find in NYC We took the train into the City, and found it easy to just hop on the subway and make our way there. The Hotel was only about three blocks from the subway stop - very convenient.The reception staff could not have been more friendly when we arrived. Amy, in particular, took great care of us. We had a standard room, which she upgraded. She went out of her way to help us with a place to eat lunch and offer other advice. The rest of the staff during our stay were warm and friendly, always checking in with how we were doing.The hotel itself is in a very quiet location. The rooms are designed in such a way that there is limited window area, but it really wasn't a problem. The room size was typical for New York, a bit on the small side, but more than enough room. The smallish lobby opens into a reataurant and bar area, with a ""library"" on the second floor, all very stylish.Although the Financial district can be somewhat limited in restaurant choices, it is getting better, and Tribeca, with many restaurants, is several blocks away. We walked both nights, in spite of cold spring nights! The only challenge can be the subway schedule during the weekend. However, there are several stops within a few blocks walking distance, and the Fulton Street stop seems to run somewhat regularly.In short, we have found a new home in New York City, and would highly recommend this Hotel.

Found a great rate online and decided to give another part of Manhattan a try rather than the usual Time Square. Gild Hall is as described online. Modern but nostalgic, cool but funky. I really enjoyed my stay. My room was on the third floor and had no view. Actually it was pretty dim even during the day as it looked out on an alley. That was fine by me as my nighttime activities made a late morning sleep a necessity. The room was more than large enough for one and would probably be good for two. I wouldn't say the black carpet was low quality as some have commented - it just shows everything right away. The bed was great - super comfy and the sheets luxurious. Never heard a peep in the night or morning. The room was warm until I found the thermostat and turned it from 'warm' to 'cool'. The bathroom was modern and nice, though the shower nobs were a bit confusing at first. Good water pressure. Staff at the front was always super polite and helpful. PLEASE NOTE: The nearest subway station (Fulton St) is under construction thru 2010 on the weekends and is closed Saturday and Sunday. The next closest subway stop is City Hall, which is a good 10 minute walk. If you're a weekend visitor it makes the hike to the hotel less convenient, especially after a long day of walking around town. Your subway line choices are also limited. But for the price it's still a good deal. I would recommend, especially if you're in town to shop at Century 21 and do things other than Broadway shows and don't mind a bit of a walk to things.","Toronto, Canada","IncurableTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",27,4.0

This is by far one of the best experiences with a hotel in New York. From the moment you are greeted by the door man you notice something different. The lobby is reminiscent of a cabin in Colorado. This is a very ""man's man"" hotel. Dark woods. Low lighting. Thick wood tables. Low level seating. Shelves of books. The nearby bar demands that you come and have a drink before hitting the streets of New York. The lobby and the attendants assisting you with check-in are not prissy. Yet, there is a great sense of customer service. Different from chain hotels, the employees even partake in being unique wearing trendy clothes that differs from stuffy, old concierge suits at other places. At night, the intimate lobby is filled with hip and young patrons conversing with each other enjoying the ambiance. There are no more than 10 rooms per floor. The rooms are decorated reminiscent of the lobby. Dark woods and rich browns. The headboard of the bed is the length of the wall upholstered in leather. The bathroom while somewhat small is clean bright and tiled in clear tiles. The brown marble floor gives it a clean elegance. The room has a huge brass chandelier that could be found in mountain ski lodge.I would not recommend this hotel if you are heading to New York City for the first time. It is located in the Financial District. It is less touristy then other parts of the city. Instead, if you are returning to New York and want to be amidst trendy residents who probably work in the skyscrapers of the surrounding banks. Or if you want to eat at small, contemporary restaurants with exceptional service and innovate menus catering to the discerning young professional. Then this place is for you. The area empties out after 5pm on a weekday. I believe that is a huge plus. The people that remain in the area are not tourists, instead its the residents. At times, you have the streets to yourself and in New York City that is surprisingly relaxing feeling.

Everything is tastefully decorated.. with little nooks to visit. And quiet! No sirens or crashing garbage trucks heard from my room. Unbelievable difference from my last visit to any big city. Rooms... who says they're small??!! I've had smaller rooms at HoJo and Ramada. Decorated in ebony wood and dark leather, the room is, again, tastefully decorated. a large 46"" flatscreen TV is a nice touch. I was in the ""smallest"" room, so the desk/dresser wasn't very deep, but I could still get some work done after dinner. Yes, the translucent plastic wall between the room and the washroom could put people off. Having the toilet just next to the wall facing into the room doesn't help. Don't plan on breakfast at the hotel... $15 light breakfast through room service could be replaced by walking two - three blocks for some lovely French pastries.

The subway is close by but Fulton Station is not easy to figure out. You'll also need to transfer to get to where you need to be. Some of the direct lines to that area also don't run on the weekends. The hotel will call a taxi for you so getting out of the area is not an issue...I stayed in a standard room the first night and then upgraded to their biggest suite, both were really great. Really SOFT and heavenly beds. Service was friendly but sometimes slow as they didn't have enough people working the front desk. I'm still working through a dispute with the hotel as their housekeeping through out one of my shopping bags. Usually for the amount of money spent here, I wouldn't have to go through this much trouble for a reimbursement.

We wanted to do the Ellis Island Tour and also be able to go on long walks, so this area was perfect. The hotel is a funky little place with a great staff - very friendly and attentive.

Why on earth cant they just put something on to the glass like a perspex decal or something.. It really is unacceptable.Front desk where always very friendly, the bell hops at the front door where in a league of their own. On the last day they could not have been better.

This time, we picked Financial District, so Gild Hall (of the Thompson Hotel group) was the best choice for us. We were quite happy with the place, despite being a tiny bit worried about the mixed reviews. The decor is a unique mix of old-boy British club meets Zen simplicity. There were lots of quirky touches, such as a rhino footrest in the lobby, and antler chandeliers. Loads of cushy leather sofas to chill. If the names Wes Anderson and Vivian Westwood mean anything to you, you will appreciate the look and feel of this place. The room: A plaid throw on the bed (which has a huge leather headboard) contrasts nicely with clean undecorated walls. The dark blue industrial grade carpet in the room, however, was jarring against the sumptuous and simple details of the room. Having stayed in a number of NYC hotels, I have to say the room size was pretty generous. Toiletries were spare, but nice, from C.O. Bigelows. No shower cap, or other little extras, just lotion, shampoo, conditioner, bar soap. Oh, and no wi-fi, and they charge 10 clams for internet. Wah?The front desk and service were lovely, the bar was fun, and attracted what seemed like locals and regulars, mixing with out-of-towners. The restaurant Libertine was closed for summer, so I cannot comment on that. But there are tons of bars and restaurants nearby in every direction. Don't be misled by those who say there's nothing down in the Financial District. We found good pizza, old-skool diners, and more. The streets are labyrinthine, so it's not as easy to naviagate as the gridded parts of NYC. Subways are nearby.

I had a hard time finding it, since it is on a side street, but I was able to find it. It is Art Deco decor and a small, boutique hotel, so there will not be a lavish lobby; but there is someone at the front desk. The staff was very, very nice and made me feel comfortable. I was able to walk to South Street Seaport by myself and no problems at all. I was able to shop, drink and eat. Fun. One of the days, I went to a spa to get a massage in the neighborhood one of the days. And, most of all I found some really great places to eat/shop...Century 21 (the best store on the planet) - within walking distance (about 3 blocks), Crumbs bakery, near wall street - Double YUM and Adrienne's Pizza Bar on Stone Street for the best pizza. It is completely safe. Back to the hotel, the room is very small, the halls are small too. The bathroom doors are dusted class. I wouldn't recommend a family or a couple, at least not the room I was in. Oh, they do have condoms in the room too. Just in case, if you meet someone along the way...;-) They also have a library on the 2nd floor/lounge too. I had a great time.

Cheaper hotels have free internet!Staff was great (Friendly and helpful).Hallway decor is nice and unique. We found the lobby somewhat dull. One night there was a wedding party. We tried to get a drink at the bar on the first floor but the wedding guests were hoarding all the space around the bar and some of then seemed reluctant on creating a pathway for us to order our drinks. The bartender seemed unconcerned about us.If you are ever in Chicago, try Hotel Blake. In Washington DC try Hotel Lombardy, you'll see why Gild Hall does not deserve a 4 star rating.

That carried no weight since all the rest was positive:1. The location is unbeatable in my eyes. Starbucks, Supermarket (with all the freshly prepared foods you can imagine), pharmacies and several bars and diners around the corner. The latter ones have food and drinkss at reasonable prices and appear NOT to be typically tourist-places but places for the people working there. We enjoyed those place much more than places in midtown where we stayed later. The liveliness on the streets from early in the morning till the late afternoon also seems to be much more that of the ""real New York"" than the life in many other places we have seen.

The restaurant looked a little pricey and was pitched as ""english gastro"", being and Englishman myself I steered away from it but from what I could see the food looked pretty good.To be honest, in this location you have thousands of choice of places to eat, so eating in the hotel would be a silly idea anyway, go explore!The business centre was pretty useful, containing a few shared PC's and a networked HP printer (which I used to print directly to from my laptop).The rooms are fully equiped with LCD TV, minibar, bathrobes, wardrobe, and small desk.Other people have mentioned the rooms are a little small, I would agree if we were comparing against other outer city US hotels, but the rooms were pretty much the standard size you get in any European hotels and inner city hotels. A/C in the rooms was great and even with the lovely duck down covers (in summer!)

It's quite easy to get lost in the maze of streets around the hotel, but this is downtown in the financial district, what do you expect? with a good map you can find it perfectly.The bathroom was great, very clean and bright and a powerful over-bath shower and fully stocked with the usual hotel condiments. Other reviewers have complained about the transparent material used between the bathroom and the room, it is in fact shaded so you can't see through it at all apart from the odd shadow and wouldn't be a problem for people sharing a twin room.My only complaints were:- $10/day for wireless, at a top end hotel pitched towards business this was totally unacceptable, even smaller low-end hotels have free wifi these days.- Wardrobe space was OK, but no drawer space at all, for longer stays a few drawers to store clothes would have been required, with two people in the room we struggled.Otherwise I would highly recommend this hotel for business (since it's a few blocks from wall street) use or for tourists since it's perfectly connected, a short walk from the downtown sites and a 10 minute subway ride from the rest of the city.",London,"TREllis2k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",7,4.0

The alarm then repeatedly sounded until the morning though was stopped quickly on each occasion. This meant that it was not possible to get any sleep from 0500.

The restaurant for dinner was delicious and the staff there were great.The location is perfect for catching the subway, getting coffee at Starbucks, food nearby at the Deli and walking to South Seaport for a meal. We will be coming back to this hotel when we make a return trip to NY. I was apprehensive about the trip and check trip advisor before I ever book a hotel, so I thought it only fair to give my feedback and say I was not disappointed in my choice.",happy2travel21,"happy2travelHawaii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>happy2travel21</strong>",7,5.0

I got the night as part of a package with dinner through Skyauciton.com. While we live in Brooklyn, we rarely spend time in that part of Manhattan so it was a nice experience. We felt like tourists for a night. The rooms were nice and chic, reminded me of the W Hotels. Beds were comfortable and the location is ok, but more geared for weekdays as evenings and weekends are pretty dead in the financial district. Having said that, there seem to be some pretty good rates (by New York standards) for the hotel on weekends and you can walk to South Street Seaport, Liberty Park, etc. By the way, there is a great little specialty grocery store/restaurant called Zaytunas very close to the hotel. During lunch time, the basement of the store is a cafeteria type deli with lots of great Medditeranean/Middle Eastern kabobs, salads, pizzas, etc.","Brooklyn, New York","abounatom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",65,4.0

I am a frequent traveller & stay at Marriott whenever possible. Most important to me is a convenient hotel with clean rooms that are functional. My 1st complaint with this hotel is the bar in the lobby that is not cleaned properly. If you arrive at 1pm, 5pm, 10pm or 5am, it smelled of beer and cocktails (as though they were spilled on the floor).But the real ""treat"" is in the rooms. The room was incredibly small (maybe a little over 200 sq ft), and yet it featured a king bed. There was very little room to store luggage and get around the room. Then there was this misguided notion of a glass wall for the bathroom facing the room (actually, it was pretty much in the room) ... you could exactly see the person in the bathroom & the toilet was right next to the glass wall (that was pleasant!). Also, the rooms and halls were in need of refurbishment.Given the location and price, we expected far more. We stayed at the Sofitel for the last few days of our trip in New York, and had no complaints ... Gild Hall is very, very mediocre and not worth the money.","New York City, New York","DQC_76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",128,2.0

Room has fairly good facilities - mini-bar, internet (to pay for), toiletries etc.Would be good if they can shove in a 'reading chair' or sofa ... a single seater. Also a coffee maker is sorely missed!!!Otherwise a very pleasant place. Staff are polite and professional.

The manager and concierge went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and to ensure we had a brilliant time in New York. The room was large and very well appointed and with Kiehls products. It is a little out of the way but we like that, its only a short taxi drive from midtown and Soho and as it is so close to Brookyn bridge its great for an evening stroll. All in all this is the best hotel I've stayed in for a long time!","London, United Kingdom","Innuit</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",8,4.0

We had looked it up on the internet and were delighted to see a hotel with a distinct designer vibe. It's as if the Scottish designer duo Collin and Justin went crazy and decorated the entire hotel!Upon our arrival, the staff was courteous and suggested an excellent Italian restaurant nearby (Giardino D'Oro). Although on the smaller side, our room (#83) was beautiful with a large comfortable bed with exquisite Egyptian cotton sheets (Frette). The large LCD tv made my boyfriend very happy. It's a smaller but very cozy and extremely beautiful hotel. I would suggest going there if you like boutique hotels.","Saint-Eustache, Canada","Shopping911</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint-Eustache, Canada</strong>",66,5.0

The decor is a very distinctive hybrid of chic and rustic -- to this day we call it the Hipster Hunting Lodge. We'll be happy if our Priceline bid lands us there again.The staff was very courteous, and housekeeping was thorough. There were nice little perks, like the tasty Fat Witch brownies waiting for us, and the overhead lighting fixture that appeared to be made out of a cast iron wagon wheel. The bed was huge and comfortable. Staying in the Financial District is more interesting than you'd think. There was a branch of The Strand Bookstore right around the corner, and plenty of places to eat. By day it's bustling, but at night it's so quiet that you'd think you were in the suburbs. It's perfect for travelers who aren't into night clubbing and partying.The room was lovely, but beware the rooms with glass bathroom doors! I loathe this trend in interior decorating, which seems to be trying to imply that sharing all at potty time is somehow sexy. The glass was frosted, but the toilet is right up next to it and you can see everything. My partner and I adore each other, but we don't go to this level of personal exposure. I don't know if they have some rooms with normal bathroom doors, but you should ask if this is a problem for you (I wish we had).Other than that, we enjoyed the hotel very much and everything worked as it should.","Somerville, MA","mare888</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Somerville, MA</strong>",2,4.0
