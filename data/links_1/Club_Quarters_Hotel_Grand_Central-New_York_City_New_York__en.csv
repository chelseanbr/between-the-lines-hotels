Please know that it was definitely appreciated.This hotel provides a lot of extra amenities that you just don’t find in most hotels, especially not ones in NYC. The rooms are spacious (esp by NYC standards) & well appointed. The Midtown Manhattan location is great. The lounge on the 27th floor has a TV, computers, printers, and bathrooms. There is also an outside patio area, with great views of NYC. The lounge is the place to be at the CQ. For breakfast there is fresh fruit (red & green apples, oranges, & bananas) and designer granola bars, such as Luna, Kashi, and Lara. After breakfast they offer fresh snacks such as Wasabi peas, M & M’s, Sesame sticks, etc., as well as packaged snack bags of popcorn, pita chips, etc., plus several different kinds of canned sodas. Then every day from 5-6 PM (also in the lounge) they have their free wine happy hour, where they offer glasses of red and white wines. Coffee, tea, and water are available all day long. Plus there are Keurig coffee makers in every room and mineral water dispensers (and bottles) on every floor too. I love staying at this hotel and highly recommend it to others all of the time.

It's a really disappointing happy hour compared to other hotels' (servers, charcuterie plates, various olives/pickles, diff. breads, beer/diff. wines, etc.).

They are bare bones when it comes to pillows, only two, guess we could have asked for more, it just seemed like too much trouble. The A/C in our room made a crazy rattling noise, again our fault for not letting them know and giving them a chance to fix it. And like many NYC hotels the elevator was a bit slow at times, and you had to use your keycard before choosing a floor, this was tricky to achieve and aggravating at times. One more thing, I don't think they offer king sized beds. Maybe they have a few but were no longer available when we traveled.

THE BAD. The rooms are ridiculously tiny even by Manhattan standards. The luggage surface accommodates only modest-sized suitcases, so I had to hoist my large suitcase onto the desk -- but it's not really a desk, just a horizontal board resting on somewhat wobbly legs, something clearly designed to look stylish more than offer any practical use. A lightbulb was out by the bed (sorry, but this is worth noting in a room with only two lamps) and the light at the bathroom mirror didn't work. Don't bother having any guest meet you in the lobby, which is a small room with no place to sit and a little ck-in stand like a restaurant maitre d' would use.

First impressions were ok, friendly staff and we were checked in right away. It appeared our request for a room on a higher floor was accommodated as we were put in 1904. The room had some definite wear and tear, and large water marks on the ceiling areas. Whatever, no drips, we didn't say anything about it. Quiet except for the sound of neighbour's door slamming and extremely loud AC (though it effectively cooled the room, so pro con). All seemed well but on the fourth night of our stay water started pouring from a vent in the ceiling onto our living room floor. Thank goodness we were in the room and were able to put a garbage can under the drip. When we called reception, they sent someone up to look but said their repairmen would not return til the next day. When we asked if any other rooms were available, they only offered a lower grade room on the second floor due to 'availability of room types'; a room on the 17th floor was promised to us the next day. To us, either a same or better grade room should have been offered to compensate. So we slept through the night with the dripping. Then, when it came time to move us, we were then told the room would be on the 15th floor, not 17th. Clearly they gave the room away. Maybe not a big deal in any other city, but for light sleepers in NYC, not the greatest. Still, we sucked it up and were determined not to let it ruin our trip. The clincher came when we checked out and were told by reception that ""we were good"" and had no outstanding charges. A week after arriving home, we noticed a charge for $150 or so on my visa. An email to the hotel asking what it was for said it was for room taxes, and that our third party booking site should have informed us, and that it wasn't their responsibility to do so on checkout! Appalling. To future hoteliers, I hope you use this as a case study in what not to do. Shame, as the location is convenient.

This hotel is supposedly renovated but in my opinion it is not 100% renovated. You can still feel the tiredness of the room, bedding, tiles, walsl in the washroom. Nevertheless, my husband and I enjoyed this hotel very much due to the location and service(coffee, free laundry and friendly staff), until I came home and checked my credit card statement. There was a charge of USD86. I was dumbfounded and contacted the hotel. According to the hotel it is the resort fee. Once again I found this extremely unreasonable. To avoid the resort fee or any kind of surprise hidden fee, I already have contacted CQ prior to my booking. In fact I have contacted Grand central branch + Wall St branch in NYC. These two branches of Club Quarters in NYC have confirmed me that there is no resort fee. Since I got the confirmation of no hidden fees by the hotel I went through and booked the hotel. However when I explained this, the hotel simply responded that there is a resort fee if you book through the third party. I found this answer this extremely unjust so I requested him to lift the resort fee. He refused and asked me to contact the manager. Later of the day I have contacted the manager and the manager confirmed again that he could not do anything about this and just reconfirmed that there always a resort fee if booking is done through the third party. As a customer we have a right to know all the exact details to make the reasonable decision. When I was requiring regarding the resort fee before the booking, no staff specified that I need to make a booking through their websites to avoid the resort fee charge! If I have known about this detail, I would not have booked this hotel. But now that I have already stayed and left the hotel they simply charged on my credit card. The hotel should have informed me PROPERLY on the first place the details and terms/conditions of the resort fee! I feel like I have been ripped off for no reason. Also when I was checking in and out there was no mention of the resort fee at all. It was simply charged on my credit card. I'm curious whether everyone who booked this hotel through the third party is aware of this nonsense. If there was no issue regarding the resort fee I have given 5 star on this hotel. But everyone please be aware of this misleading resort fee charge.","Toronto, Canada","Natalie J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",0,1.0

The reception is small but I arrived at a good time and check in was instant. When full with people checking in and going up in the elevator it can look a little chaotic, but do not go on first impressions. The rooms are fine but there is more than meets the eye. Food can be ordered direct to the room from dozens of places or from the downstairs Italian place. The 27th floor room and balcony has free snacks, fruit and drinks all day (tea and coffee then wine from five). The internet is always free both in room and up on floor 27 with computers to use there.Meetings can be held there or just to relax. Your phone can become a mobile door key with their app which also acts as a guide when in New York. There is free chilled, purified water on each floor in refillable bottles. Rooms have yoga mats. There is a fitness floor. The TV has all kinds of functions beyond watching programmes such as streaming to it. There is a cupboard on the landing near the rooms with more room items to self-refill if needed. These are clever touches that really added to my stay. The rooms for central NY are a decent size with helpful bathroom items, iron and board, seating/office area and bed, various lighting options and USB charing. I only had three very minor issues. First, a slightly loose electrical fitting (room 2109 near the door) and secondly, a crack in the sink. The other minor issue was the loud noise of the air conditioning but that was because it was highly effective. After a while it can just be turned off. But these were minor issues and did not impact on my stay at all. Looking out directly at the Empire State building in front of me kind of balanced it out. The shower was good, towels are plentiful. The bed and bedding were fine. I like their commitment to minimising washes, you can choose when they change the bed and towels.I'll be back. The place is great, the staff are friendly and chat when they see you. It's a feel good place. The staff cannot be more helpful and importantly, they seem happy and proud to work there. We had some laughs and the free wine@5 kept flowing.Explore floor 27, order some food, get free coffees and cold water all day, try the linked restaurant directly from the hotel. Have free snacks, free fruit, relax in the club room and the balcony. This is a different experience, more like being in an apartment block than a hotel. But then apartments don't have free coffee either!I've given a five star review. I'm not saying this is a perfect place, the lobby is small, there are tiny quibbles I mentioned. But you know what, I didn't care a jot. The experience here was great, the staff were helpful and the various features are a step beyond other places. I think of this more like managed apartments than a hotel, if you have everything you need such as socket adaptors and so on, you'll have a great experience. This is a different experience to an old style hotel. The Thai food I ordered directly from my laptop is on my way to the room, last night it was great crispy chicken from another place. You manage your own staff here. Somehow any minor quibbles go away when you can order food, get free refills and relax looking out at central New York.",,MarkCoyle1969,0,5.0

Our room was not ready so they checked our luggage (at no charge) and invited us to the 27th floor. Our return flight was a late evening flight again we checked our luggage and headed out to enjoy our last day in NYC. Upon arrival to retrieve our luggage we again where invited to the 27th floor to relax. Thanks to Greg that was a perfect way to end our trip.The location is perfect midtown east a few minutes walk to lots of attractions. The hotel is extremely clean. The elevator requires your room key to access the floors. The rooms are what is to be expected in NYC as far a size but well laid out. The bed was comfortable, linens and towels were great shower was hot. Did not use safety deposit on the 2nd floor but they were available, The water stations on each floor a nice added touch.There is a gym and laundry facility as well and all free. The 27th floor is a great place to chill after a full day of tours and the snacks and beverages are yet another added bonus.The real perk here is the staff. Front desk, housekeeping and maintenance staff always had a smile and were friendly and welcoming.

Knew was going to be smaller so wasn’t quite sure what to expect. Surprised initially at the reception and the room (reminded me a bit of Premier Inn back home). Once in and settled though, checked out the club living room and that was it. Completely won over. Staff are a credit and deserve all their plaudits. Had a room on 20th floor to get away from street level noise as far as possible in NYC. Resort fee is reasonable in comparison to other hotels. The whole club room thing with wine and snacks is a winner and well worth a visit if you want to chill and re charge. Safety deposit boxes are in a strong room on second floor, which are a twin key arrangement (you and staff member), which seemed a bit inconvenient as apposed to room safes, but soon planned around this. We had a standard room rather than club room, which I believe were smaller, so would avoid if possible as a leisure traveller. Caught a few residents looking to change rooms at times in reception, which the staff seemed to be trying to accommodate. Reminded me of Premier Inn a touch back home at first. Can’t really add much more than the other positive reviews of this CQ hotel, with the staff being a credit to it (unfair to single anyone out, but I’m still not your type Chris ). Really pleased we chose this over our usual.

And as you can see, I’ve received an email from Club Quarters to rate the hotel. I’ve felt completely cheated because I had read bad reviews about Club Quarters and didn’t want to stay there, so it was a big surprise when I got to the address and there was only a sign saying it was Club Quarters, it was past 10pm and I had to enter and ask the recepcionist if the hotel was Hotel Boutique at Grand Central. About the hotel: I had asked for fridge and microwave, there wasn’t any at the room. The room is very tiny, you can’t even open 2 bags and walk through the room. The bed is queen size (little), I was told they don’t have king size beds. When I got to my room, the USB charger didn’t work, so I’ve called front desk asking if they had an adapter because I’m from Brazil and the outlet is different, they told me they didn’t have and I had to buy one (it was past 11pm). The bathroom is walk in shower but it’s fabric curtain, I don’t like it, and it didn’t show that on the pictures. I had booked for 3 nights but after all the problems we’ve decided to change hotels, so I asked for a refund for the last night, we stayed only 2 nights and I explained all the problems I had and that I thought it was a different hotel but indeed it was Club Quarters, even though, they charged me anyway for the 3 nights. It looks like they’ve been receiving bad reviews under the name of Club Quarters, so they’ve decided to use another name (Hotel Boutique at Grand Central) to improve their rating and mislead the customers. When I left, I asked them to hold my luggage for a couple of hours, when I returned to retrieve my luggage, it took a long time to find out where they were because the recepcionist didn’t even know that the hotel has another room upstairs to storage luggage. They say they receive packages for free, but I would advice that it doesn’t feel trustable, they doesn’t look organized and the reception area is very little. Only good point was the wine at afternoon and bottle of water for free.","Rio de Janeiro, RJ","Sisi-rio</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rio de Janeiro, RJ</strong>",58,2.0

I went down and asked whether there are other, bigger rooms (specifically asked about the 2nd floor) and the rude guy from above told me they are not ADA accessible. I went to sleep with a bad feeling and in the morning asked the clerk about bigger rooms and sure enough - there were two rooms on 2nd floor which were bigger and more suitable. I was transferred to that room and they didn't charge extra.All in all it's a good and clean hotel, but if you are a wheelchair user you need a a superior room (2nd floor).

With no lobby to speak of , when there were issues with guest checking in or checking out, the bottleneck at the single service counter turned into a long wait. Then they could not find my reservation. When they apparently did, they kept saying I was already checked in, which should have set off alarm bells. They sent me to a room that had been occupied, with bed slept in and with other guests' luggage. When I came back down to the lobby, their look was that of a deer in the headlight, and took them a while to figure out what had happened. What a mess.

When I holiday I usually select reasonably priced locations with breakfast. However since I didn't want to waste a day changing hotels, I stayed on. This is a detailed review as I feel it is quite expensive for a tourist who spends the day out and only needs breakfast, a shower and a bed for the night.The carpeted room is a good size (for a single person), furnished with a large bed (queen I think - a bit too soft for my liking and the pillows were a bit lumpy), a chaise longue with a reading light, upholstered chair, matching headboard, pedestals, a table, flat screen TV, a full length mirror, wall mounted coat rack and a wardrobe. There is also a radio with a USB port to charge your phone which was a relief as I did not purchase a US plug. The duvet cover is made from a slippery material, so if you use the blanket from the wardrobe underneath, the duvet slips off. I found the air conditioning unit a bit strange, it would heat up the room and when it overshot the temperature, it would cool the room. The light switches are conveniently located at the door and below a pleasant reading lamp attached to the headboard.The cleaning staff keep the room so immaculate, I almost forgot to wear my shower shoes! You can leave a card on the bed so that you can help conserve water by not having your beddings changed. I bring this up for the reason below.The bathroom is also a good size for a single person, large mirror and a wall mounted magnifying cosmetic mirror. The shower itself is stupid, you have to turn to cold water to turn the tap off, so when you're lathered up, cold water shoots out and you waste water as you adjust to find your comfortable temperature again. So I kept the tap running for my shower instead of constantly fiddling with it. There is a hair dryer provided.There is a capsule coffee machine and coffee and tea in the room but no kettle to boil water for tea. You have to go up to the 27th floor for hot water. This bugged me as I drink 2 glasses of warm water after brushing my teeth. There is chilled water with water bottles available on every floor.There is a gym and washing machines available for guests to use on one of the floors but I didn't use (I'm not doing washing while there's places to go!).The living room on the 27th flooris relaxing and you can enjoy your morning coffee while admiring the Chrysler building. It has a flat screen TV, four PCs and free internet (WiFi is free and available throughout the hotel). Breakfast beverages are available all day but there's no breakfast. In the morning energy bars and fruit are available but the station is unmanned. For two straight days, I arrived only to leave for the elevator waiting area to ring reception to send someone up to empty the grounds out of the complicated coffee machine as the other guests couldn't be bothered. In fact, another guest felt it was more productive to beat the machine than call reception.Later in the day, the station is manned by fabulous hosts. Wasabi peas, salted peanuts sunflower seeds, pretzels, chips and my new best friend, a huge bottle of m and m's are available as well as a glass of wine at five.The staff at the hotel from the receptionists Ashley, a thin, short young man and a tall gentleman (I didn't get their names, sorry!), to the handyman and living room hosts, Elizabeth and Chris, are utterly delightful and want to be at your service.Ordinarily as a tourist, I would rate this type of hotel three stars because there's no breakfast and not having my own kettle was inconvenient but a cellphone charger in the room, free WiFi with excellent reception (which I needed thanks to MTN's crazy roaming charges), four PCs, a printer and exceptional staff tack on one more star.I think, in terms of value for money, this hotel is best suited to people who are looking to escape the hustle and bustle and value their privacy.","Durban, South Africa","Quanta K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Durban, South Africa</strong>",7,4.0

I also received the check out bill which were taxes that are stated on booking.com when I booked. Didn’t realise how much theses were going to be. $108 per room so this added another £170/180 to our room rate. Just be mindful of this when booking through hotel websites. It still may be the case if you book detect with the hotel. Also prices you see in most shops are minus the tax so beware.

She came up to our room and proceeded to look over the damage, taking pictures of everything that was affected. She offered to take all of the items with her to clean.

The staff was friendly, the room clean and well laid out, and overall it was a good stay. The rooms are very small but well equipped, and the windows good enough to keep out most NY traffic noise (other than sirens). I particularly appreciated the thoughtfully laid out bathroom that managed to provide adequate surfaces to place things, very good lighting, and a well placed mirror. Sadly, it had no ventilation (I finally figured out that the fan was broken, too late to have it fixed for my stay), which meant that the bathroom smelled strongly of bleach from the hotel's cleaning products my entire stay. The second night I discovered how thin the walls were when a small child moved into the room next door. I couldn't hear its parents, but its toddler voice just poured through (of course, toddler voices have that ability). My only other beef is with the dismal coffee set up in the hotel ""living room."" There was one automatic espresso/coffee machine, which meant a very long line in the morning and then it was just bad. I discovered why when I saw a staff member refilling the milk reservoir with skim milk - blech!!! Luckily there was a Starbucks and other coffee choices within two blocks, but I do think an approach to coffee such as multiple carafes with different types of milk is a reasonable norm to follow in this day and age.","Silver Spring, Maryland","WanderingOne</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silver Spring, Maryland</strong>",37,4.0

Our greeting upon arrival was warm and friendly (as was all contact we had with the staff throughout our stay). The rooms are quite small (as are most NYC hotels), but it was well equipped with coffee machine, hairdryer, iron and ironing board. The room was clean and well presented, the bathroom the same. I felt that the room itself could have worked a bit bitter with more useful storage and a better layout - for example there was a small table with seating around which we never made use of and nowhere to store our empty suitcases. Both of these things could be easily resolved and would have made our stay a little more comfy. I guess it’s ok if you are only staying a couple of nights, but for any longer can become a little frustrating. The air conditioning was effective, the bed very comfy and for a city centre hotel I was surprised at how quiet it was and how well we slept! We didn’t hear any noise whatsoever from any of our neighbours. The gym is a great addition, and although we came with all great intentions, “holiday mode” took over and we did not use it, but the equipment there was great. The wine happy hour between 5-6pm daily was also a lovely touch. A nice place to go for a drink or two before heading out for the evening. Also great to have a little snack area for guests to help themselves to - small touches but great to have. The hotel is in a great location too, far enough away from lots of noise and people but only a short walk to Grand Central, Times Square etc so found it really easy to get around the city from there. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel, and wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again next time we’re back in New York.

Originally I booked it for its proximity to Grand Central bc is Feb & we expect a snow storm (1 block away from its 44st exit) and for its fair room rate. Upon arrival, shocked & skeptical bc there is no lobby but a large foyer w a couple of Kiosks w a couple of smart looking fellas (good thing). Well, I was put to ease immediately when I was treated with super friendliness and kindness. Graig (Greg) was helpful and made my stay comfortable. He's like the everything go to guy, helped bring my luggages to my room (bc I hurt my shoulder) and my car bookings, and even lent an ear to hear me rant about my day. The room was modern & clean, with modern bathroom (most vital). Size is small like more NYC rooms and perfect for solo travellers. For couples, may be book a larger room. The roof top lounge is my favourite, its where guests hang out with all day complimentary snacks & beverages, use of computers, simple breakfasts, and free flow wine in the evening. The Wine-server guy (forgot his name) is so funny, he does a trivia every so often w give-away bottles. It brought the hotel and its residents a little closer. Vice, no in-room safe, inconveniently on a separate floor. Summary, hotel may be small, but they made it a special place to stay, a little more than a regular NYC hotel.",,Sharonchiu2002,0,5.0

We started our visit by stopping off at the hotel to drop our luggage at 9:30am, knowing that we could not check in until 3. The front desk staff was so accommodating. Surprised that there was no lobby, we asked if there was someplace to freshen up and change our clothes. This is when we discovered the hidden gem of this hotel. The bellman gave us access to the 27th floor lounge where we grabbed some coffee and snacks, used the restroom and regrouped. After a great afternoon at the parade, we arrived back at the hotel for a quick check in at a kiosk and friendly front desk staff who told us our luggage had already been placed in our room and there was a happy hour on the 27th floor from 5-6. Our room was clean, spacious (for NYC) and well appointed. After a quick shower we ventured to the 27 floor and were greeted by an extremely fun and festive atmosphere and our host CHRIS and his team. I am a jaded, former New Yorker and was not expecting to have so much fun at a hotel happy hour! Chris welcomed every new arrival with warmth and humor that immediately put everyone in the room at ease. After a rousing game of trivia that included everyone, we happily stayed behind and met people from around the world. It was St. Patrick’s Day in NYC and we opted to hang in a hotel lounge thanks to the fun atmosphere created by Chris and the rest of the crew. I have stayed in a lot of hotels over the years and will definitely be returning to this hidden gem on 45th Street!

There are 4 CQ Hotels in Manhattan and I chose Grand Central because of the price and location. I have to say the hotel stands for the quality of the brand, since this is a very neat hotel with a great location in Manhattan. It’s close to Grand Central Station, the Chrysler Building, the 5th and Times Square. The hotel is very clean. I got the basic room and I was surprised with the size, it is small but actually bigger than the standard hotel room in Manhattan. Bathroom was clean, shower was great and the staff is very friendly and helpful. Be sure to check the Club Living Room and have a glass of wine for free on the happy hour, also some snacks and a great view of the city. The free water bottles, online check-in and key room on your mobile is a great plus.Overall, CQ Grand Central is one of the top choices to stay in Manhattan at a reasonable price for what you get.

Location is convenient to transportation, tourism, business and general access to many of Manhattan's highlights (Broadway Theater, Fifth Avenue shopping, UN, and Rockefeller Center to name a few). I would describe this hotel as business meets boutique. Rooms are well fitted with the basics, however, everything one can possibly need is accessible and comfortably laid out. Large televisions, comfortable beds, microwave and coffee maker, and in larger rooms a sofabed and small kitchenette.The key to CQ is their proximity to central locations in cities around the country.Some internationally. We have often been able to check in early if a room is available and staff will store luggage after check out should you want to stay in town. The bonus of this hotel is the lovely high floor lounge and enclosed, heated terrace with great views of midtown Manhattan. The lounge is outfitted with several computers and a printer, snacks including fruit and granola, and a high end coffeemaker - all complementary. There is a lovely happy hour with complementary wine, sodas, coffee and snacks. Today, we returned from our day out to be welcomed by Zishan, the Guest Service Manager. There was light jazz playing in the background and the atmosphere was calm and welcoming. As a long term patron of the CQ hotels, I have to say this was one of the more welcoming and relaxing visits I can remember. Thanks Zishan for your generous welcome.

The location is great -- it's just a couple of blocks from Grand Central and many sites are within an easy walking distance, including Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and the Empire State Building, depending on how much you like to walk in the city. Of course, there's a subway station at Grand Central, which is nearby. The staff were very friendly and helpful -- especially Jillian and Ashely at check in -- and our room was nice and comfortable, if on the small side. We especially liked the ""living room"" on the 27th floor, where you can get snacks, coffee & tea, still or bubbly water all day and free wine at 5. The view from up there is terrific. Minor complaints: The shower--it was one of those that has a very slight dip from the floor of the bathroom and is not separated from it at all. The drain doesn't do the job of t's keeping water from getting all over the floor and of course the floor mat gets soaked.

I tried to sleep but couldn't because of the stench and had to switch rooms in the middle of the night.

Hotels in NY are expensive. It took me a few weeks to finally decide on one and we choose the Club Quarters Hotel at Grand Central. Location: We liked how this hotel is so close to the Grand Central station and hence it was easy to get around to most parts of NY. There's also many eateries nearby and the Grand Central station itself has bakeries and a food court. We could also walk to nearby attractions like Bryant Park and the NY Public Library. SAKS fifth ave and Rockefella Center would be about a 10-15 min walk away. Rooms: We travelled as a family of 4 and we were given the biggest room which was the one bedroom suite with kitchenette. It comes with a sofa bed, a small dining table with 2 chairs and a tiny kitchenette with a sink and a microwave. There is no stove in this type of room configuration. It was quite a tight squeeze for us but it was manageable. The bed was comfortable and housekeeping did a good job too. My only gripe was that the room on the 7th floor was noisy. Not only did the sirens from the police cars and fire trucks kept me away at night but the heater in the room as well. It was noisy and loud and it made me feel like I was staying in some crummy hotel. Other than that, service was good and the staff were all very polite and helpful. If you don't wish to splurge on expensive accommodation in NY, this would be a good choice.

Room - this was spacious for a New York room and given we were only on the 10th floor it was very quiet and we slept really well. We were also located quite near the lifts but were not disturbed at all by them or any guests. Hotel - location is great and right in the middle of Manhattan making most tourist attractions within easy walking distance, it is also located close to Grand Central so getting the subway is easy. So many food options surround the hotel too. The hotel adds great value for money with the free wine and drinks every day along with free soft drinks and snacks all day, use of computers and printers and a lounge/balcony area with views of the Chrysler Building. For a small gym room it had a good mix of equipment meaning you could get a good workout in and quite a few people could fit in all at once.Overall, we had a really great stay and would recommend this hotel for anyone coming to New York.","Birmingham, United Kingdom","EmLiesel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, United Kingdom</strong>",29,5.0

Plus a happening happy hour from 5-6pm every day with free wine (a solid, dry white wine from the North Fork included) and snacks (SO yummy granola) and fruit (apples, oranges, pears). But then there are the cons: the lack of a room minifridge is SO ANNOYING. You can leave food with the reception to put in the staff fridge but it’s really trying to have to ask for it each day or night. There’s plenty of room in the room for such a minifridge. The WiFi is also not great: it cuts out here and there and at times made it hard to work in the room. Finally the staff made made me grit my teeth sometimes. I guess they’re trying to be hip and cool but it came across as unprofessional at times: with their jaunty behavior, playing hacky sack in the lobby and the braying guy giving out wine.

Chris mingled with guests and was a superb host. Thank you!I would make some suggestions regarding housekeeping. It would be great if at least a couple of additional towels were stocked automatically. We had 2 bath towels, we were 2 guests, and when I asked for 2 extra they were quickly delivered. I left a note the next morning to please leave us an extra and housekeeping did. On our last night, the tv would not turn off. A tech came up and looked at it, touched something, and the tv went off. In a few minutes, the tv came on again on it's own, and we called back. The tech came up, pulled out the wires and just totally unplugged it so we could get to sleep. We did make sure upon check out that the staff knew that the cables were out because there was an issue. We had a late flight so we hung out in the lounge area until it was time to leave.

Arriving:When I arrived, my friend who had booked the room had a late flight so I couldn't check in. The staff at the desk were kind to keep safe my bags for me and invited me to stay in the lounge to wait for my friend. I was very tired and it was quite late but everything was made better by the amazing view in the lounge, and the free snacks and drinks. I met Elizabeth, who was working at the lounge. She was incredibly kind, funny and answered all my questions, recommending great places to go to during my stay. She is a hoot and brings a smile to a weary travelers face! She goes the extra mile for her guests at the hotel! Problem solving:Whenever there was a problem during the stay, the staff members were always attentive and on your side to find a solution. Melissa and Mallory were especially helpful (and that helpfulness extended even after I had checked out!)Happy hour:Drinking wine with a dazzling view makes everyone feel glamorous. David at the happy hour was entertaining and kind, clearly someone everybody likes! The wine was amazing (and free, OMG!)Room:The room was clean and an amazing view from the 23rd floor of the Chrysler building! Shower has a good pressure and the air-con worked fine.Elevators: As its quite a popular hotel, of course there's going to be a bit of traffic with the elevators, but you kind of figure out when everybody is leaving at the same time and I often waited to go a little bit later or earlier.

This is written from a perspective from someone who hasn’t been to NYC since 1998. I mainly travel for leisure. Visited with my husband. Check in: Came in at about 2:15 PM on a Thursday, was able to check in early. Accommodating and nice. Chris greeted us at the door and he was awesome and friendly!Room: Fairly quiet, was able to sleep well with very little sound from the street (view faced Lexington Ave and E 45th street). I was on 7th floor and view was fair. Walls seemed solid for soundproofing. Had a Keurig machine. Bed: Comfortable, pillows were soft, and they only provided two for the queen bed so we called the front desk and asked for 2 more and they brought them up right away. There’s also a blanket in the closet that is one of the softest blankets I’ve ever felt, which made it more comfortable.TV: Worked well, channels were plentiful. Air conditioning: Works fast, was able to be comfortable in the room. Bathroom: When we checked in, the staff asked if we were ok to be changed to a “handicapped accessible” room, has an accessible shower, and stated it was “bigger.” We both did not have physical disabilities, and we thought the room was fine. The shower had a chair that could be folded up, and we kept it up. Water was hot. Water pressure was fair. Had a sliding “barn” style door, which was adequate to keep sound down. There was a fan in there, but there was no way to turn it on. I’m not sure if there was one at one point, but it gets foggy when there’s hot showers.Amenities: WINE O CLOCK!! Free wine at 5 PM Everyday! Complementary water bottles on each floor with cold water – this was nice so I can have water as I was in and out all day. Snacks available throughout the day on the 27th floor. Breakfast had a big coffee/espresso/cappuccino/late machine (only one for the bar), bananas, apples. Also had Pepsi products in cans. Snacks included granola, M&Ms, pepper crisp crackers.Davio’s, which is an Italian restaurant in the basement of the hotel was decent! Ate here for two nights, one including before the marathon. When you tell the hostess your room number they charge it to your room and take 15% off. What they could do better: Provide a night light in the bathroom – I don’t like to turn on the light when I have to get up in the middle of the night. This was minor, but something I could’ve liked. This is an AWESOME location for a hotel in NYC and we loved staying here. Thanks for making my trip an amazing one!",,Cynthia M,6,5.0

The 11th-floor room was small but comfortable with a good bed, decent storage space and a good-size counter with chair that served me as a work area. The remote for the flat-screen TV was the easiest to operate of any I have used worldwide. Housekeeping kept the small bathroom (shower only) and bedroom absolutely immaculate. Lighting was excellent. The A/C, however, was terribly loud, and I really missed not having a safe. I got frustrated with the unreliability of the WiFi. Each floor has a free water-to-go station with empty bottles that can be filled with chilled water. There is also a guest closet in the corridor with items that are often needed. For example, I made good use of one of the ironing boards and an iron.The lobby is not traditional. It is a small space with two computer stations and a bench that can likely accommodate three people. A staff person, however, is always here. Guests can check in and out by computer or with staff. Three elevators make up the back wall.I interacted with several staff members throughout my stay. All were upbeat, friendly and helpful. They gave reliable answers quickly to any question that I asked. For those who want a hotel with a place to relax, the hotel has a huge room with an outside terrace on the 27th floor.

I immediately emailed the hotel and got a prompt reply informing me that my request has been forwarded to the housekeeping department. After this, nothing else happened. I tried to email the hotel directly again and, this time, no response whatsoever. Of course leaving the jacket at the room was my fault but I'd expect a minimal level of attention from the hotel.

Ave.The staff were always very friendly and helpful. The wine poured at happy hour was from a local winery on Long Island, and was surprisingly good (we live in Marlborough, New Zealand's premier wine producing area).On the down side, but certainly not enough to detract from the highest rating: Since the rooms have the fridge and microwave, they should include plates, glasses and cutlery (or these should be readily available from the club lounge). When we called to get some cutlery, all that we got was some cheap takeout plastic that was unsuitable for cutting the bread and bagels we purchased from the Grand Central Market. Also, I really dislike the ""pod"" coffee makers (Keurig, Nespresso, etc.) as the amount of waste they generate is unconscionable. Better to have a small drip coffee maker or high-end instant (Starbucks Via, Robert Harris Fusio). All-in-all, highly recommended and very good value for the money.

As they were living in Manhattan we decided a hotel close to them would be appropriate. We settled on this hotel on the basis it was not only close to them within a 15 minute walk but also close to all the major attractions.The room we had was on the small side which was to be expected but clean with good facilities. The only drawback which we did not complain about was that we were on the seventh floor at the back of the building. This was just about level with the air con mechanisms on top of the next door building. They were incredibly noisy and as there was a heatwave when we were staying were working overtime thus making even more noise. I know that the hotel would have moved us but we coped.The lounge area was really good with snacks and free wine and soft drinks available between 5pm and 6pm which opened out to a small open air terrace which gave you great views. The tea and coffee were available all the time. The lounge also had the IT facilities for guests.We hope to visiting my step daughter and her husband on a yearly basis whilst they are there and subject to getting a good price for the hotel we will not be looking elsewhere when we do.,"Woodley, United Kingdom","KJBMTB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Woodley, United Kingdom</strong>",170,5.0

Where to start?Firstly great location, next to grand central station, restaurants and bars in and around hotel.For the price we paid compared to our last stay in a different hotel, the room was great value. Clean, good view, air con, great tv with Netflix. Descent size.Now the amazing stuff; firstly the staff were all amazing but especially Zishan who offered us a room upgrade if we weren’t happy (but we were), give me the best location to drop the question to the misses and a great restaurant to go to after, he was a big help to making our day special. Chris gave a great first impression of the hotel the second we walked through the door, was funny and made the little one feel special.The hotel kept on giving part of stopping at the hotel enabled us to use happy hour between 5-6 with free wine and cans of pop, other bar type snacks. Coffee all day, fresh water machines on each floor with bottles to re-fill. Saved us a lot of money.Secondly the roof top terrace had a great view and was clean but best part was u could take ur own food and drinks up there. Again saved us a lot of money rather than paying loads at roof top bars we could buy our own refreshments and enjoy the view in piece and quiet.The value for money is great and I would recommend anyone to this hotel. Yes there will be better hotels in New York but u would be paying stupid money, when you can get what we had for the price we paid I know what I’d choose.

Being so close to Grand Central station, even getting to the subway was easy, to get to other parts of Manhattan further away. The staff is great, very helpful and ready to serve and accomodate guests. Chris, the showman of the place, making sure every guest goes unnoticed, and that everyone's glass is always full at happy hour on the roof terrace of the hotel, while you take pictures of the Chrysler building almost next door. Rey, Sandy and Jevness at front desk all ready to help us with anything we needed. Our first room had a bit of a problem with the A/C but when we mentioned it to them, they changed our room with no problems at all. Elizabeth from housekeeping making sure I was getting enough shopping done and keeping me up to date with where to find the best deals. All staff was friendly and helpful, and excellent at their jobs. The rooms were very comfortable, our first room had a refrigerator and microwave, our second did not, but we didn't really feel a need for them. I would think these are especially handy for people travelling with children. The laundry room was a great extra: 2 washer/driers for guest use at no extra cost, detergent included. The only (obvious) problem is that they're pretty much always in use, so a little stalking is needed to catch one in time to get your laundry done. A small fitness room can be found if you still have enough energy after all your walking. A great choice as our honeymoon hotel, and will definitely be coming here again next time!","Helsinki, Finland","Tinatee74</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsinki, Finland</strong>",7,5.0

Anyone reading this review with a view to considering where to stay in NY please be in no doubt that we would recommend this hotel highly. Very central yet within easy walking distance (if you like walking and we do) to many of the iconic symbols of New York - the Chrysler building, 7th Avenue, Times Square, St Patrick,s Cathedral, the Rock, the Central Library and so on. However if walking is not your thing well a hop, skip and a jump takes you to Grand Central Station and the subway will take you all over. Be sure to get a 7 day pass though and you can whizz up down, left and right as often as you like and can visit everything. Brilliant. Back to the hotel though. This is a very friendly, welcoming place where nothing is any bother to the staff therein. Furthermore the rooms are comfortable (as is the bed) and of a practical size. Good toilet/shower facilities and includes a goodly supply of toiletries. There is also a little sofa with a table in front and a supply of coffee, tea and uht milk along with a coffee maker. Television, WiFi and air conditioning completes the scene. The bonus to this venue is the lounge/terrace on floor 27. What a wonderful addition to one’s stay this turned out to be. Head up in the morning for copious amounts of coffee, tea, granola bars, bananas, apples, oranges. All free gratis. Now every evening, around 5.00 pm there was a complimentary wine reception ( red and rose), but also from the fridge could be had tins of soft drinks (I can’t remember what now which possibly tells you something!). Included were crisps and snaky things or nibbles - and very very popular this all proved to be to the guests in the hotel. We loved it. The hosts at these daily events were all lovely people (one in particular was quite a colourful character, and another one quietly charming). Regardless - they contributed and added value to the quality of our stay here. This was our second time visiting this fabulous city - flying from Edinburgh, Scotland - just to spend some time with you all. We will do it again (though not in the heat of the summer) and we would look, once again to stay at this hotel.

At the rooftop is a lounge area, with coffee machine, sodas and snacks complementary by the hotel. And every day at 17 o clock was wine hour, where they served local wine, also for free. Really nice atmosphere, you could small talk with other quests or just enjoy the rooftop view. The hotel had no own breakfast area, but you can find many cafes and diners around the area. The rooms where small, like in every big city, but I've seen worse. Queen size bed, a small couch/table area, fridge and bathroom. The foodportions are big in th US, so the fridge came in handy when we wanted to take-a-way the rest of the meal from restaurant. Air conditioning was a bit loud, but it worked. No complain about the cleening, towels where changed daily. We got a room at the 17th floor, so heard no traffic noises. If you are travelling from Newark airport I would recommend to take the bus, newark airport express to bryant park and walk a couple of blocks from there. Had no complaint about the bus ride. The departure was at friday afternoon, we had reserved some extra time for the traffic so got to airport on time.

My family and I were tremendously surprised and pleased. First of all, it is very tough to find a hotel willing to accommodate a one night stay, especially a Saturday night. The folks at Club Quarters didn't seem to mind. The price was super fair in terms of NYC hotel room prices, especially for a last minute booking. Location is great; a five minute walk from Grand Central and close to a variety of subway stops. It was easy to hop around the city with this as your home base. Check-in and checkout were a snap and they had a room ready for our early check-in.The room itself was the usual small-ish NYC hotel room. One bed with a fold out sofa bed, which might be touch for an adult to use comfortably but our teenager had no issues. We were struck by how quiet it was considering the busy midtown bustle 15 floors below.And if that wasn't enough to make us happy, we discovered the terrace on the 27th floor (open 24 hours) with beautioful three direction views of Manhattan. And the clubhouse that is attached offers snacks, sodas, fruit, coffee, etc. gratis. That, along with the ice cold filtered water machines (with bottles for those on the run) on every floor, are very thoughtful small touches that really make a difference.

Chose this hotel mostly for location and value for the money. Room was on the 22nd floor and in a corner. The room was clean, and had one of the most high tech TV's we have ever had. Air Condition worked well but I wish that Housekeeping would not turn the system off completely when it is 94f outside for 3-4 days in a row. This left the room hot and required the unit to run late into the night.The guest amenity closet is a great concept but... I wish the hotel would stock it with more than just a Ironing board.Again no biggie just asked the desk for what we needed.Wine at 5 and good old David entertaining everyone was a hoot. And we are not just talking sampling wine but good old fashioned pre-Broadway entertainment.Now for the negative thing:-The Guest/Self Laundry- This is something that is a huge amenity if executed properly by a hotel but in this case this was done rather poorly. Mind you it is Free(including the Detergent), but do not count on this as part of your trip. While this was not the deciding factor in choosing this hotel(Value and Location were), it has been something that was a deciding factor in the past and we were counting on laundry being available. The laundry is a home grade all in one washer/Dryer machines. This means 110V drying which takes a very long time(5-6 hours easy). The hotel has 2 of these machines and when working if you can dry a few items in your room it probably wont be a issue. However, when guests put detergent powder in the liquid dispenser or into the drum or both and plug the machines... they don't work well. I would have rather seen a paid commercial laundry like at the Villa Fontaine Tamachi on our last trip that costs 3$/load to wash and dry(plus detergent) then a free set up that 1) you cant get to 2) doesn't work. It is great that it is there... if you can get to it and use it but with one machine broken and a 5-6 hour wash cycle, it was always in use.Choose this hotel as the value and location are second to none... but don't rely on the laundry if you have a extended vacation.",,Paul G,3,5.0

We had not expected that. The room was clean and comfortable. There were a nice outdoor terrace and indoor lounge on the 27th floor, and these were comfortable and hospitable, although in NYC one does not usually choose a hotel for staying indoors, the views of the city at various hours of the day from that vantage point were fascinating.

The room has plenty of power sockets to plug in the chargers. The best feature of this hotel is its roof top terrace at its 27th floor, which is connected to a large social room that occupies the entire 27th floor. The room and the terrace are open 24 hours, and has some freebies (tea/coffee, apple/orange/banana, etc). During different meal times, they put out some free snack food (granola bars, finger food etc). In the evening 5-6pm, there are free wines! This room also has three nice iMacs and one printer for everyone to use. People just sat there chatting or reading or working on computers. This social room on the top floor is the jewel for the hotel. The views from its terrace are awesome. One downside is its tiny lobby – just one person standing behind a ‘bar’ without any chair.

My last evening at the hotel, I was chatting with a lady on the elevator and she said what a great hotel this was and I shook my head thinking... why? Then she proceeded to tell me that there was a great roof top terrace with wonderful views on the 27th floor, coffee and snacks 24 hrs, breakfast items in the mornings as well as a fabulous Happy Hour from 5 - 6 in which I was never told of. Instead of going to my room each evening; I would have sat outside and enjoyed NYC with everyone else at the hotel. I then went up to see what she was talking about and met Kevin. He was truly sorry that I had not been told of the extra's that the Club Quarters offered and he brought me a 'goody bag' to my room. He definitely exemplifies the true meaning of customer service, dedication and loyalty to the hotel chain and gets 110% in my book. I did speak with reservations when I left and I was offered a certificate to be used at a later date. It was a lot of money to spend on a hotel room without using the hotel to its fullest ~","Atlanta, Georgia","Happy130</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",48,3.0

Seriously, it was like a cupboard and every few minutes you could hear and feel a train rumbling by as the room was directly above Grand Central. I was shocked that we would be down-graded (to this extent) without any explanation and were still expected to pay the luxury rate. Only after much protest and a few hours of waiting around did we get moved to a suite that was clean, quiet and comfortable but certainly not luxury. We were offered a free breakfast for the inconvenience.I found the whole experience quite unsettling and wanted to discuss my concerns with the hotel manager, who it turns out, was never available. We finally connected with the Guest Services Manager who was gracious and apologetic. She offered an adjustment to our rate, which was greatly appreciated. In looking through reviews it's disconcerting to see this has happened to other travellers. It's more typical to get upgraded at a hotel, rather than downgraded. It felt like they were trying to pull a fast one. It felt underhanded and unethical.As far as the hotel goes, it's a great location but that was the only real advantage. The room was showing its age, there wasn't a room safe and the elevators that did work were very slow.Bottom Line: Take a pass on this one.",Canada,"YYCMRS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",36,2.0

We were on the 18th floor and this was good for keeping the traffic noise at bay during the night.Free tea, coffee, sodas, and snacks were on the 27th floor, and also great seating there. Sadly, we never made it to the happy hour where they serve free wine. We would come back after a hard day sightseeing and take the lift straight to the top floor for our coffee, which we took back to our room in the disposable cups provided. The location was another factor in choosing this hotel.

Points to be aware of: The basic rooms are very small. There is no safe deposit box in the room (i reckon there is one down in the lobby). Lobby is very basic and small. Points to clarify and maybe improve: Check in and check out process went smoothly however the person that checked in for us did not give us any other information other than your room is on the XX floor. I aspect information which include (location of gym facilities, happy hour, bar, WIFI access) to be volunteered instead of me asking for each and every one of those. The day before check out, we went to the reception to ask for late check out the next day and was told by the staff that unfortunately they are not able to do so until the day of check out and it is a first come first serve basis as to who comes down/call them as early as possible.

Housekeeping took my pijamas on the 4th or 5th night probably by mistake when they changed the sheets. I told the receptionists multiple times ( probably all their reception people heard of it, I asked every day). Same response, we will look for them and return them to you. Same thing every day. When I started saying it’t not ok for me to sleep in my fitness clothes because they took my pijamas one of them actually made a joke that he would go to Marshalls and get a pair for me, all laughing. I did not appreciate the unprofessional attitude at all. My pijamas were nowhere to be found until the end of my stay. After I insisted that it is absolutely not ok and I should be compensated for them they took a day to get manager approval to reimburse me for the amount I showed them on Amazon for an almost identical pair. They said I would get the money back on my card. What do you think? No money ever returned...No interest in your customers plus bad jokes plus committing to something and not doing it after the customer left. Seriously?

To start, it's located about a 3-4 minute walk from Grand Central Station so you can pretty much get anywhere in the city via subway in no time. The hotel itself is just a few doors down from Lexington Ave. so the exterior of the hotel isn't that busy on a standard day. The lobby area is very small, but then again, it doesn't need to be big and grand because the guests who stay here just need a place to sleep while on business. The staff at the front were very helpful when I arrived and I'd highly recommend downloading the CQ app on your phone and checking in with that (you can even get an electronic room key) and you can avoid any waiting time and go right to your room. My room was the standard club room and it had a nice little sofa and table and a pretty sizeable bet, but wasn't that comfortable if I do say so myself. The shower pressure also wasn't great but the rest of the bathroom did the trick. I liked the TV set up in the room where you could connect to the room's wifi and stream Netflix or Hulu or even airplay from your device if you wanted. Really cool! I was on the 4th floor and didn't have a window at all, which didn't really bother me, but it would have been nice to see outside during my stay.As per the rest of the hotel, every day from 5-6pm there's a wine and cheese tasting on the gorgeous 27th floor lounge and terrace. The terrace is outside and has ample seating with views down what I think was 3rd Ave. as well as the Chrysler Building to the South. The lounge itself has snacks and beverages all complimentary at all times during the day and night. The gym is pretty small and on the 3rd floor but it's what you'd expect for a hotel gym. Like I said, the staff were awesome and definitely enhanced my stay here. I would 100% return, especially to this location, even though there are a few others around the city like Midtown, Times Square, opposite Rockefeller, and Wall St.","Toronto, Canada","MGonthego</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",29,5.0

Always an issue in hotels. Plenty of elevators, never waited for long. Staff was pleasant and we took advantage of the managers wine hour one evening. Nothing too special but when the weather is warm enough they will open it up for fresh air.
