My spouse and I enjoyed a relaxing 3 night stay before traveling to NZ & AS. We were greeted by smiling & friendly staff who were so helpful and welcoming. Our 1BR/1B condo was modern and comfy with a great view from small balcony. Security was smooth and elevator could drop you off straight to street level. Great walking spot to wonderful restaurants, beach and high end shops. Everyone was helpful with directions or suggestions, especially Maria @ reception, exceptional service & fun with a pleasant attitude.

Everything is mostly to the standard you would expect at a Ritz-Carlton property throughout. The location is not beachfront but still has nice views and is an easy walk to the main roads and luxury shopping. Check in was easy and very friendly concierge. The suites are geared for longer stays with kitchenettes; spacious and bathrooms are large, high tech and functional. Lots of little details at this property elevate it to a higher level, from the hotel whisking you directly to your floor, to the welcome drink and personalized check in service, to the room amenities and little welcome gifts. Not much time to experience the property as a whole but the infinity pool was perfect for an evening swim-my only comment would be there was no attendant on at that point and there was a number of wet towels that had been discarded around the deck. Gym was clean, spacious, and had all the equipment you could need. Would definitely return for a longer stay next time.",Canada,"Nessie F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",55,5.0

From the moment we arrived in the wee hours after a long flight delay and without my luggage, Mr. Ho at the front desk made every effort to turnaround the events.Mr. Ho’s warm welcome followed up by an amazing birthday surprise of a handwritten note (!!) along with some delicious birthday treats was such an unexpected delight. Kudos to him and the entire front desk for realizing the smallest gesture goes a long way when a trip has an auspicious start. As for the property, it is everything you expect at a Ritz Carlton and more. This property has residences and the space delivers on every point. Beautifully styled accommodation, well-appointed bathrooms, gorgeous kitchen, a bed so comfortable you want to pack it and take it with you, and extra space to make it feel like a home vs a hotel room.The location is tucked away from the hustle bustle but still right in the middle of all the shopping, dining, etc you expect in Waikiki. Plus, the view from our room did not disappoint.The infinity pool is a sight – there’s a family pool and an adults only pool to suit whatever works for your stay. Quiora was the perfect dining option for sunset cocktails and light bites. And, Dean and Deluca is onsite for all your coffee, dessert, grab & go needs. Personally, the in-room nespresso machine is all I need but the D & D brekkie is a nice option.Kudos to the team at this property, the level of care and attention to detail is everything the Ritz Carlton Gold Standards promise.

The views on the high floors are special. We loved our room which was a two room suite on the 27th floor. The small kitchen area was perfect to be self sufficient when needed. The service was exceptional at times and under whelming at other times. Crystal from the concierge desk was outstanding and made our stay very enjoyable. The breakfast and bar servers were OK not great. Cold espresso served in a cup with lipstick on it, an awkward conversation about including gratuity on over charge was a bit odd. It didnt hit me until later why a hotel like the Ritz would do this. Having traveled to many Asian countries I realized many folks dont tip at all and they probably include the gratuity so that they dont get stiffed. I consider myself a great tipper always a minimum of 20% when I get even good service. I like to tip big early in the stay so that folks remember and the service gts better as the stay moves along. Adding 18% automatically makes for an awkward feeling...do I give them the extra $5 or $7 I normally would or leave it alone?? Will they even remember??? I am not a fan of this approach however I understand it. We would have loved to have been able to eat at Sushisho however we were told there was no chance of getting a table. This is another one of those policies that high end hotels should do a better job managing. If we are dropping $1000 a night on a room the hotel should have some availability at its restaurant for guests staying there and we should not be locked out of any chance for a table during a week long stay. I would definitely stay here again for the view, location and concierge service. Visitors should know this seems to be a very asian oriented and focused hotel which makes for interesting elevator rides.","Scottsdale, Arizona","Doug R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>",26,5.0

I’ve never used a “travel company” for packages before because of my misconception of them. I always thought it meant you’re assured to get the most basic of everything. Not so with Costco Travel. I highly recommend them as they made our 23rd Anniversary trip absolutely top notch from flight to car service and hotel. So at check in we’re greeted w/ the most beautiful purple & white Leis along with a refreshing beverage & clothes to wipe with. Time for actual Check In arrived and they already knew that we were on our 23rd Anniversary & graciously upgraded us from a nice corner studio to a full 1 bedroom 2 bathroom Suite w/ full Ocean views. It was beyond any expectation I had. We had Suite 1205 and as you open the door directly to the left is your 1st full bathroom w/ electric toilet, very sweet, and a over sized soaking tub. As you venture down the hall to the left is the full kitchen w/ everything needed plus a washer/dryer combo in the closet. Continue forward into the living room when you’re greeted to the Ocean Viewed wrap around balcony. To the left is the bedroom and 2nd full bathroom w/ double sinks, electric toilet & huge shower. There’s also another exit to the balcony from the bedroom as well. So, yeah, we were quite happy with the room and it’s cleanliness & amenities. As far as the service aspect of the property all I can really say is, BRILLIANT!! You’re made to feel special and welcome, quite like family or good friends. Always treated with kindness and respect. On the 1st day of check in they waited for us to leave the room to set up a deeply appreciated Happy Anniversary card signed by the beautiful staff along w/ a complimentary chilled bottle of wine awaiting our arrival back. There’s absolutely nothing I can fault them on nor complain about.

We casually mentioned a bourbon that is a rare find but can sometimes be found in Hawaii and we came home that evening to a note from our bartender (Ku'ulei) who told us that she had located the bourbon for us at local store.

We typically book a suite and/or 2 rooms now that our son is a teen. We also tend to book premium rooms (oceanfront). On our latest trip, we decided to try the Ritz as booking 2 rooms at the Halekulani would have cost over 2k/night. We were able to book a 2 room apartment at the Ritz for significantly less. We were extremely impressed with the property, the units are fully equipped and very contemporary. I'm still unclear why the pricing was so competitive, my only guess is that the property is not right on the water - however, if you are in one of the higher floors - you have a great (and unobstructed) view of the ocean.

I booked my three day trip to Waikiki with my Marriott Bonvoy points. For 180,000 points, I was able to get a beautiful Ocean View room (E2212). When I say 'beautiful', I mean without a doubt GORGEOUS view of Waikiki Beach. My fiancé and I arrived on 01-08-2020. From the beginning, we felt like royalty. The valet and concierge were so perfectly accommodating and friendly. Sky, the young lady who met us curbside, was a delight, welcoming us. She accompanied us from the ground floor to the lobby and brought welcome drinks (delicious - and optionally alcoholic), before passing us off to the reservations manager, Joel. Joel welcomed us and answered any, and all, questions we had. Joel showed us to the elevator and wished us well. He was just as friendly and knowledgeable as Sky! Great check-in experience.Once we got to our room, E2212 - WOW. Just WOW. The view was incredible, the room was spotless, and the concierge left a special plate of chocolates, as well as a bottle of wine, for my fiancé and I, who happened to be celebrating our recent engagement. There was even a personalized card. Beautiful touch.Over the next few days, we enjoyed the perfect location of the Ritz Residences, as they are on the corner of 'luxury row', Waikiki's shopping district. The Ritz is in the perfect location, regardless of what you plan to do in Waikiki.The second night we were there, I attempted to do a load of laundry in anticipation for our departure, but when I woke up in the morning, I realized the dryer had not dried any of the clothes. I contacted the front desk at approximately 7:45am, and they offered to send a maintenance engineer to check out the dryer. Within 2 minutes, there was a knock on my door - the maintenance engineer! Talk about efficiency! He attempted to solve the issue, but after a few minutes, once he realized there was no heat going to the dryer, he offered to send housekeeping to re-wash and dry our laundry for us. After he departed, housekeeping came right to my door, took all my laundry, and told me not to worry. The next morning, upon returning to my room after a trip gone the whole day and night, I discovered all my laundry, on my bed, washed, folded and wrapped in tissue paper with a note from housekeeping. I was so appreciative of the services provided. The housekeeping staff was fantastic. When we were due to depart, unfortunately the hotel was too booked for a late check-out, so we had to leave the room. (insert sad face), However, the hotel held all our belongings, safely, and we were able to retrieve them without issue, after returning from lunch, to go to the airport.I could not have asked for a better experience. We intend on returning to Hawaii in October and if we spend any time back on Oahu, we will not go to any other hotel! The Ritz Residences, Waikiki is fabulous in every day, and second to none!

While the service with Ritz is always impeccable, the suite itself was somewhat disappointing. Suite 2609 had great views but had some issues (always corrected with prompt maintenance). The sliding door into the master, off its track anytime we used it, rendering unusable until corrected by maintenance. Living room was missing its area rug under the living room grouping, causing the sectional to slide apart anytime you sat on it. A/c was perfect. Kitchen was adequately stocked for anything you may require. Stackable washer/ dryer also was a nice perk. Bathroom has no doors so if your staying with another friend (not companion) can be tricky getting ready. Commode has a frosted glass door for some privacy. Plenty of closet space. Efficient elevators. Room service was good. Typical add-on 20% service fees AND 8.00 room delivery fee. Sadly our included breakfasts were only available down in the restaurant lobby, some resorts give you a breakfast credit (towards in room dining) that was not available. The spa services were good, I've had better 90 minute massages. The steam room was under going maintenance improvements, so the only spa amenity I like was not in service. Valet was also very efficient as we rented a car for our stay. (40.00/ valet fee per day)There is an adult pool area as well as a separate family pool area. We did not use either but was a nice option. Housekeeping was very friendly, warm and efficient. Also generous with toiletries, water, daily chocolates etc. Not really a super pampered/picky 5-star type guest, but when you actually see your bill hovering at the 15K mark your either totally pleased with what was provided and where things were lacking.

Elite recognition: As a Titanium elite, upon request, they did move us to a higher floor room(they initially put put us on the 10th floor with minimal view), but no real other elite member benefit. I would not anticipate on much elite membership recognition if you are planning on staying here. Late check out request was denied with a cold ""no"". It's not a bad property but just have low expectations and you'll be fine. Pros: - Being a residence hotel, it does not collect an extra person fee- unlike many other hotels in waikiki - Room is spacious for a waikiki hotel with a nice balcony- concierge staff downstairs were eager to help with beach towels/water/directions/recommendations, whatever you may need. - 2 nice pools, one for family / one for adults. the family pool gets quite crowded in the afternoon. - I'd recommend hanging out at the pool/jacuzzi in the evening! you can enjoy the live music from the restaurant above. Good to know:- It's about 2-3 blocks away(~15min) from the beach. If immediate beach access is what you want, this is not where you want to stay at. Cons:- Front desk ALWAYS(morning/afternoon/evening/late night) understaffed and you need to get in line and wait 10-15min if you need them for anything- service at breakfast restaurant was just not there - aside from somewhat overpriced food(which I expected from a Ritz Carlton), my water stayed empty for a good 20 minutes and nobody came by to fill it. I tried to make some eye contact with my server for a while but gave up after a while. I really don't expect to have to ASK for such things at a Rits Carlton.

The property is new and clean the staff are all what you would expect at a Ritz, very kind and helpful, BUT the policies are lacking! As Bonvoy elite members we spend a significant amount of time in Marriott properties and unfortunately this Ritz has fallen short of our expectations.We arrived around 11AM and watched dozens of other guests receive access to their rooms, but we were not granted access until 4PM, no early check-in for elite members? We had been on a long flight from Seattle and were hoping to at least freshen up and change clothes, we were pointed to a well-used single bathroom to do so...which was not ideal. We opted for the deluxe ocean view room specifically because it is described to have the “living area separated from bed by privacy wall” this is a completely false description, there is no wall. The TV is also placed in an odd location, only visible from the sofa, not the bed. Another concern, the pools! Not enough chairs for the number of guests that the hotel accommodates. It is nice that they have a family pool and an adult pool. There is also a wait list for chairs at the adult pool, they send a text when the chairs open up. We did this once with no problem. Another time, we received the text, packed up from the noisy family pool, walked over and they had no chairs for us so sent us back to the family pool. We eventually got seats at the adult pool and they offered us each a smoothie for the inconvenience, but again our concerns are not with the staff, but with the process. And, today we have a late afternoon flight and called down to confirm late checkout (which we requested at check in) and were told it was not possible, even as elite members. Very disappointing.

We absolutely loved it and wish we could have stayed longer, but we were already booked elsewhere on the island. This Ritz is only three years old and is comprised of two large towers full of million dollar plus residences. The towers overlook an extremely posh shopping area, and are within walking distance to great stores, world class restaurants, and the beach. Upon dropping your car off with the valet, you then ride some extremely sleek elevators up to the lobby. The lobby has an absolutely amazing view of Waikiki. They greet you with tasty drinks, cool towels and complimentary leis. We booked a one bedroom suite, and they upgraded us up to a corner suite due to our Marriott status. It is an understatement so say the suite was awesome! Very contemporary with light beige and blue hues, and marble accents in the bathroom and kitchenette. The views of Waikiki are phenomenal. We were on the sixteenth floor and the balcony was very comfortable with two chairs and a table. Upon entering the suite, there is a brand new washer/dryer to your left (behind a door) and a spacious bathroom to your right. The bathroom has a separate water closet, complete with a Toto smart toilet (my kids got a kick out of the bidet functions and the heated seat). It also has two sinks and a shower and tub. It is, of course, fully furnished with all the necessities (dental kits, lotion, sewing kit, shampoo and conditioner, gel, lotion, nail filer, etc). Farther into the room is a fully equipped kitchenette, with a sink, Miele oven, Miele fridge and freezer, stovetop, Nespresso machine, and everything you could possibly need in a kitchen (baking utensils, pots and pans, eating utensils, plates, cups, bowls, mugs, etc). The bedroom itself has a king size bed, a desk, closet with iron and ironing board, and a flat screen television. There is a separate sitting area with a table and four chairs for dining and a pull out sofa. The views were amazing. There are several bars and restaurants on property. We unfortunately only tried the room service, which was great. There are two pools. An adults only pool and a family pool. Both have great views and are decent size for roof top pools. Very clean! I believe they are the highest rooftop pools in the area. The fitness room (I always need to work out) was well equipped with brand new cardio machines (Precor treadmills, elliptical, steppers and bikes) and hoist stationary weights, free weights, body balls and medicine balls. Again, I loved how clean it was. There was someone changing towels, trash, and cleaning machines off more than once in the hour I was in the gym. My kids already asked if we can stay here again the next time we come to the islands. ","Chicago, Illinois","newhampshire411</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",181,5.0

Another 30 minutes went by. Mom roaming the lobby in her wheelchair and dad sleeping. Rachel a front office manager then enters and said I hear you want to upgrade.

No closet to hang in 2nd bedroom and little things that were very strange however they did bring flowers and a fruit bouquet (parents anniversary)as an apology a few days later though they never did bring me drawers promised to put my clothing away and housekeeping I was not overly impressed with.

The hotel looks very nice, but I’m writing based on my experience booking with the hotel. I received an email in advance of my stay, as I always do when I stay at a Ritz. However, this email outlined some “rules” they have about elite travelers. It outlines that, because it is a residence, that they would not honor some Bonvoy benefits. I understand that it’s important to let people know that in advance if they choose not to give people benefits, but the email rubbed me the wrong way for a property where I was going to spend nearly $1,500 for two nights. The email indicated that they were not going to honor the benefits from the Amex fine hotels program. They said I would not get breakfast, when that come with Amex fine hotel bookings. They said I wouldn’t get an upgrade, which comes when it’s available with a fine hotel booking. They said I couldn’t get a late checkout, even though that’s guaranteed with a fine hotel booking. I was disappointed in my interactions because I emailed them and asked if this was just a template email, and they said that they would honor those benefits. Then, I emailed later about the upgrade. They again said they wouldn’t honor an upgrade, contradicting the email they had sent earlier. To their credit, they refunded my money because I was disappointed with my interactions with them. But, I’m now ambassador level with Marriott, and they were not respectful and sent inconsistent messages to me. Considering what I’ve spent with Marriott and the number of nights I’ve stayed with Marriott, I’m offended by my treatment at this hotel. They even knew that I was bringing a close friend who lists her husband to cancer to celebrate his life because he wasn’t able to make it for his 60th birthday. I expect a lot from a hotel in Hawaii because of how nice and hospitable people here are. I expect even more from a Ritz, because it’s my favorite brand and has awesome service.

We had looked at various options for renting a condominium while vacationing there and chose the Ritz as we did not want any surprises. This location is a little different from the other Ritz Carlton properties we have stayed at because of the condominium style rooms. But the service and facilities are all up to the standards we expect for a Ritz Carlton and we enjoyed it very much. We had a two bedroom unit and the set up of that suite is very nice with two king size beds and two ensuite bathrooms. It included a small but very modern kitchen which suited us fine since we were not planning any major meal preparation. Just wanting to have a casual breakfast there and bring snacks and drinks to the beach. I was in the fitness room early each morning and it is one of the best of my memory.

Robin at the pool was helpful as was Benjamin in Valet. Titanium status is not recognized. I had observed a different titanium guest receive additional amenities such as a room upgrade, a pool cabana stay which was complementary as of September of 2019. We were not offered any amenities this stay, not breakfast, not bonus points or anything. The front desk manager, Mary Jane assured we would have a late check out at 4 PM, when I called to confirm the next day the front desk staff was not aware of it. It created hiccups throughout our stay and did not make it enjoyable. For this price point, I would expect everything to fall in place, the Ritz Honolulu falls short. When we arrived at the resort at 1:30 PM, we were told a room upgrade was available for a fee but not complementary. I feel like if the room is available, why not offer it to a guest, the manager told me the reason is because those are residences that are owned. They are not complementary but we could purchase the upgrade even though they are vacant. We had to wait for our bags from the bellman and arrange our bag in the lobby while a room was available and vacant. So bottomline is Titanium status is not recognized at this hotel and I would certainly not stay here again. I have received more recognition and upgrades at the Westin and Marriott as Titanium.

First, I was disappointed in the location of the hotel. On the map it looks much closer to the water. It is a short walk, to Waikiki beach, but the views are actually to the West, and the water is further away. So, you see a lot more city in between. Speaking of city- the traffic noise is pretty loud. I was on an upper floor, but it was still surprised how loud the street noise was from the balcony. The good news is the sliding doors are very high quality- and noise was not an issue when they were closed. I did notice and appreciate that detail.As for the room, it was nice- but really just sort of average for an upper-end property. Meaning, if I hadn't known it was a Ritz, I would have thought it just a nicer Marriott or Westin. The bed was super comfortable and it was nice to have the mini kitchen, it was still a very small room and you could also hear noise from the hallway. Again, on my profile, I ask for upper floors and rooms away from the elevator, so my room didn't quite fit that profile and I was surprised the room was so galley style. (as in, one long narrow space) Service by hotel staff was great-- with the exception of the front desk when we checked in. A pretty chilly reception and the first thing annouced was: there are no upgrades! (OK, thanks, we didn't ask for one) So, overall, a nice place, and while I could normally balance out the non-beach location for the service, in this case, it didn't work out and I can't say I would recommend this hotel.","Boston, Massachusetts","rodgernm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",43,4.0

Unfortunately, O'ahu recently passed an ordinance limiting the neighborhoods where short term rentals are allowed: Waikīkī, Ko Olina (leeward side) and the North Shore. The prices in Ko Olina are higher vs what I want to spend (more than $1 million), and North Shore is far. So I focused my efforts on condotels in Waikīkī. The Ritz is very new, and in my price range: I gave it a test drive.Pros: The service was excellent. Yokina kept me posted regarding when my room would be ready; Big room (667 sf) with a large bathroom w/ two sinks, door for toilet, Toto washlet w/ remote control, a dinette, kitchen and two TVs; Firm bed; Large lanai; Sydney at the pool was supah nice. She hails from LA, but embodies the aloha spirit; Speaking of the pool, there are two. One for adults and one for kids. The adult has two jacuzzis and cabanas for rent; Spa and fancy restaurant on site; Large gym, but I would prefer a water machine vs little water bottles (be green); Close to Ala Moana, Foodland & Zippys, IMP and the strip (Kalakāuā).Cons: Far from the beach; I stayed in the Diamond Head (East) tower. You have to check in at the Ewa (West) tower, and walk to the DH tower; I stayed in 1510. You have to traverse a long walkway that overlooks a parking lot. Not good for someone who doesn’t like heights; Gap under the front door that lets light in. The bed is right by the door.In summary, the pros are way better vs the cons. The cost was $620/night (Nov), which was $10 more vs Trump. However, in my mind, the Ritz is nicer vs the Trump bc the room is bigger, the bed is firmer, it has a better pool, and the gym is larger. I’m doing the math to see if I can generate sufficient cash flow to make a Ritz condotel work. However, if I do not buy, the Ritz will be my no ka oi (number #1) place to stay in Waikīkī.","Los Angeles, California","KeoPAloha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",101,5.0

While we waited for Room #2 we enjoyed the new Italian resto on sit (separate review to follow). I requested a complimentary upgrade due to our Titanium Bonvoy status along w/ the fact that we were celebrating several occasions (daughter going to UHM, grandson's 1st birthday & anniversary) and the Ritz was able to accommodate us. When we went into our upgraded rooms we walked into Room #1 that already had a pack-n-play, high chair AND complimentary 1) toys for my grandson; 2) a slice of birthday cake; and 3) fresh fruit plate. The bed was also beautifully decorated with flowers indicating the number of years of our anniversary. In Room #2 room service stopped by and delivered complimentary champagne and macarons.

So far it’s been not so good and everyday it gets a little worse.Lots of lip service & none sense talk honestly we have not heard anything like it, so fake it hurts.Have to eat at other hotels as the kitchen can’t knock up a gluten free meal. We contacted the hotel ahead of schedule to ensure gluten free meals were available. We were advised that there were GF meals and that the hotel is accommodating by customising meals where possible if they are not specifically gluten free. On arrival we have found this to be a lie. The room service manager has tried to help us and has gone out of her way to get us some meals and some GF pasta. However when I tried to order lunch today the kitchen at the restaurant told us they couldn’t help us and recommended we spoke to Conceirge about finding somewhere else to eat. Breakfast is really limited to GF toast and when we asked the chefs if they would do a pancake for our son they refused. We even went to a grocery store to buy a GF pancake mix and they refused to cook it. So we have been attending the Hilton Hotel instead for meals, we also asked for help from the area manager but they can’t help neither. This is a really painful experience.To top it off we came back to the hotel pool this afternoon and moved one of the sun beds a few inches the pool attendant fell over herself to advise “ you are not allowed to move the sun beds”. First trip to Hawaii and this place has destroyed it. I won’t be coming back.Thanks Guys",,James S,3,1.0

Rooms are beautiful, loved having in-room laundry with two kids in tow, everyone is very kind and accommodating.Loved that the pool staff was there if you needed them but not overly pushy to sell food and beverage. Loved the delicious lemonade by the front desk-after coming in dusty from hikes it really hit the spot. Free ice cream by the pool every day made everyone happy.Valet isn't an easy gig and everyone at the front is SO friendly and do a great job greeting every single guest. The one small complaint was the housekeeping service was quite inconsistent. The front desk double checked upon our arrival that the bedding had been changed to hypoallergenic bedding per our request. Each day it was an adventure to see if I would wake up feeling stuffy (if the bedding had not been hypoallergenic) or completely clear (if they had followed directives). This changed daily. With two children, turn down service at 9:00PM doesn't work for us and on our first two days, room service didn't arrive until 4:30PM. Some days it was a professional Ritz Carlton quality job, some days not so much. These are true first world problems that were easily solved with nasal spray and a bit of patience. Overall it was a delightful stay and we would stay here again.","Brooklyn, New York","moop6883</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",32,4.0

We were 3 adults in a one bedroom suite. The suite was beautifully appointed, very modern and clean. We had plenty of room and a nice lanai to see the ocean. We were very comfortable. The bathroom is spacious. The elevators were very fast so it was no problem staying on a higher floor. The service was wonderful and everyone was helpful and gracious. We had a door come off a runner and the maintenance crew responded quickly and fixed it quickly. The location is great for restaurants and shopping. We walked to different restaurants most nights. The breakfast in the restaurant was good but the selection was small. There were 2 negatives for us. The first is that the pools and the surrounding decks are very small. Several times we found that all the chairs were taken for both pools and the only option would be to pay a hefty fee for one of the cabanas. This does not make sense when all you want are chairs for an hour or two near the end of the day. So basically almost none of the cabanas were taken. The family pool was very crowded since it was still the school holidays. The second negative is that it is a 10-15 minute walk to the nearest beach through the park. It's a nice but narrow beach and you have to rent chairs and umbrellas ($40-50 a day) and there is no reserved site for Ritz guests. The property is new and very nice but depending on your priorities it may or may not be the best place to stay.

Yes, not beachfront and I did struggle with that as I am a total beach nut! And to sit on an oceanfront balcony would have been the bomb ... but, we had that in Maui the previous week and I couldn't pass up all the amenities this place had to offer. I am not a big city gal but I was so pleasantly surprised at how I enjoyed walking down a few blocks to amazing shopping and restaurants - at 9 PM deciding I want an ice cream - no problem - 3 block walk! LOL The Fort DeRussey park across the street is a lovely green space that trully made this spot perfect - it cut down on all the city noises that would have been a distraction in any other place and it was a pleasant 7 min walk to the beach. The concierge on ground level by valet will have your beach bags ready with towels and some cold bottled water. We booked on points for 240K for 5 nights - (5th night free!); parking was $40 day. We were upgraded to a Grand ocean view King too! Compared to the other Marriotts in Waikiki I feel I got the most value here with my points.Our room was spacious with a full galley kitchen with Miele appliances including an awesome Espresso machine - love! We had a washer and dryer too - these were some top reasons we stayed here - being in Hawaii for 11 days we needed to do laundry and also to be able to have a kitchen for a quick breakfast, snack or evening glass of wine on my balcony was the ticket! We had king bed in middle of suite and then living area had a sectional sleeper sofa. The bathroom was spectacular!! It had a separate water closet with a heated seat bidet complete with a remote control!! My son was in love!? lol Double vanity, make up mirror, large soaking tub and walk in shower... lovely bath toiletries were replenished daily. We had evening turn down service and twice daily our waters were restocked in our fridge. Robes and slippers in our closet and plenty of storage space for clothing.The kitchen was fully stocked - almost so that I had no where to put my groceries. We didn't buy a lot - but, every drawer and cabinet had dishes, pots, toasters, cutlery so I had to put my most of our food on small area around stove top. Perhaps they could put some shelving under the sink - there was a lot of dead area under there or a small pantry in the closet? Parking is a steep $40 valet. But, they are courteous and prompt. You could get by with not having a car - but, for our first trip we wanted one. And it's in line w/ the high costs of Honolulu actually. The ground area where you exit building and also pick up car is very busy sometimes and honestly a poor design... ppl walk in front of cars and don't mind children running around - they should have had the elevators perhaps more shielded from this busy valet area. Oh the elevators are the bomb! Fastest and most quiet ones we have ridden in and they are smart! No buttons inside! My son loved them - you use your key card to get in them and tell it where you want to go... Two infinity pools on the lobby floor - Floor 9 - where you will also find two restaurants and the spa. One adult - which we didn't use because we had our son and the family pool. Each have free sunscreen and towels and also typically a bowl of apples (not the best though). We used that sunscreen every day as I underestimated how much to bring for 11 days! The restaurants are very pricey as to be expected for a resort and in Honolulu. We got drinks and dessert from the pool bar and then had breakfast in the main restaurant by the lobby. It was very very slow service and not full - I believe they were understaffed... this was unfortunate as we were pressed to check out and get to airport. Breakfast for 3 -$115! The Ritz does not guarantee upgrades or late check outs for elite members. But, we did a nice upgraded room and they did give us a noon check out... The only real hiccup in our stay was our last morning there - we had hope to sleep in as we had a red eye flight and would be traveling for almost 24 hours to get home... well, 6:15 maid is knocking on door saying ""housekeeping""... ummmm... hello, what?? She gives us two bags of toiletries!? Ok, but we don't need these and why are you waking us up!??! I guess it was a mistake - but,a costly one for us as we could not get back to sleep!! This really added to an already very long day for us... a few hours later I called front desk to ask why they woke us up so early? She finds out it was a mistake and apologizes - I ask for later check out - she cannot give it but I manage to get $100 room credit - which paid for most of our breakfast. Still would have rather had the sleep and late check out as our trip home was so very long and difficult. I would stay again - just gotta save some more points - could never afford it otherwise!!","Mobile, Alabama","Pamela M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mobile, Alabama</strong>",297,5.0

We had room at corner which only had 4 rooms and it was very quiet and close to the elevators. Our room on 17th floor faced the beach and overlooking the pool area.

Restaurant we only used once for a breakfast and my only negative point in this review, service was as everywhere else excellent but the food was average at best spinach mushroom omelette looked very pre prepared and tasted ok, we did not use the restaurant again.Would definitely stay here again, if we find ourselves back in Waikiki for the bar, the rooms, the service, the spa and the pool but not for the food.","London, United Kingdom","Jcotta1970</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",26,5.0

The hotel rooms are spacious and nice. We had two rooms -- each with a king bed and a pull out sofa. The pull out sofa bed got rave reviews from our 11 year old. The room has a few cooking options and a washer/dryer which is fantastic when on a long trip. (I wish we had known before the trip!)The hotel has two pools - one for adults only and one for kids. The kids pool is nicely laid out but we wish it was bigger or that the kids could have used the adult side too (maybe just call it a quiet pool). We had a few snacks and drinks at the poolside bar. All were fantastic. And the bartender was really attentive and positive. (Unfortunately, I didnt catch her name.)The check in was great -- the front desk team was so nice and they deftly handled some very needy guests with efficiency and kindness.The hotel is not on the beach -- you need to walk to the beach. we walked the beach, played in the water a bit, explored some of the hotels there -- and decided that compared to most the Ritz was much nicer and more well kept. it rained a ton while we were there but we enjoyed Leonards malasadas for breakfast, the Pig and the Lady for dinner, and Poke Bar for lunch. We shopped a bit in town too, walked up Diamond Head. I think if i went back, i would probably try to stay on the beach at the halekulani but the ritz is a great option too and a bit quieter and much more refined than most of the other hotels in the city.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","worldbuspleasure</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",4,4.0

Sometimes at high end resorts the staff will exhibit an elitist attitude. Not so at the Ritz! Everyone is treated equally and with the utmost attention. This property was awesome. Since these units are individually owned, they come with a kitchenette and a washer dryer. These were essential for our 10 night stay. We could pack lighter knowing we could wash easily and having a mini kitchen allowed us to have our own beverages and snacks handy when we did not want to go out to eat. It also allowed us to bring ""home"" leftovers from the many fabulous places we had dinner. We grabbed breakfast in our room most mornings.Love that there was a family and adult pool. The family pool looked like a lot of fun, but it had the most people. The adult pool was quiet and relaxing with a great view of the ocean, even though you are a few blocks from the beach. The pool overlooks Fort Derussy and Hale Koa (military resort), so you have an unobstructed view to the water. We have family military that we were visiting, so we visited and ate at Hale Koa a couple times. Its also an easy walk to the bustling Waikiki beach area. We walked to most restaurants.We only ate at the Market restaurant, which serves the poolside also. On the expensive side of course (you pay for convenience) but not out of line as Waikiki is an expensive area.We traveled with our youngest adult son. He slept on the sofa bed that was turned down each night, so that eliminates the hassle of a sofa bed. Sliding doors create a separate room at night for privacy. Bathroom is large and modern. Toilet is latest and greatest. It lights up when you walk into the commode area! Heated and equipped with spray heads and a dryer for your ""business""My only suggestion:Switch to regular Keurig machines in the rooms! The Expresso machines just don't make a good cup of coffee! We used Bonvoy points for our stay, and the Ritz was the same number of points as the Sheraton Waikiki.

This was a first for me for a US based hotel. All of my feedback was noted and followed through. Upon arrival we were greeted with leis and our luggage was later delivered to us. We had to wait awhile before we could check in due to the long queue which was the only complaint we had during our entire stay. When we finally accessed our room there was a nice welcoming note along with a large tray of fresh fruit.Staff service was excellent with majority of staff somehow remembering our names throughout our stay and displaying lots of aloha spirit. Todd was very helpful each time we met him from showing us our room, providing restaurant recommendations and giving advice on things to do. There were a lot more people deserving of recommendation but I did not always catch their names from the single interaction.We were upgraded to a deluxe room with an unobstructed view of the ocean and enjoyed our sizable lanai overlooking the pool. Room was rectangular with a lot of features packed inside. It had a roomy feel with a big bathroom and sliding room separator to isolate the luxurious twin beds (unusual) from the pull out sofa bed. Both sections had their own TVs and in the main area a compact table and dresser. The kitchen was fully outfitted including the small two burner cooktop and exhaust fan (excellent filtering and no after smell when we fried up a bunch of Portuguese sausages and eggs for breakfast). A Nespresso coffee maker was restocked with pods each day. A handy washer and dryer was also tucked away but that was a little noisy when in use. The nice part was unlimited detergent packs were supplied so we were able to do all of our laundry. The bath had two sinks with lots of counter space, a separate room for the toilet (which was outfitted with a high end electronic seat (Toto?) with built in warmer and water jets) and walk in shower with soaking tub. The towels and robes were plush and plentiful. Toiletries were very nice.Parking was $40 per night which was on par with other hotels in the area. Staff was quick in retrieving our car each time and gave a lot of good advice for traffic conditions or parking suggestions.The pool was crowded in the late morning and afternoons but excellent for swimming laps in the early morning. The adult and children pools were separate with beach chairs, umbrellas and some cabanas.The gym was well equipped with a lot of cardio and weights. I wish I could have used it more.Unfortunately there was no executive lounge or beach front.

Because of the location, the turn in is a bit difficult to find. After that, are you escorted to another level for actual check in. Since it’s not a big area, there are always people waiting and my total arrival experience lasted almost half an hour before I was actually checked in. In the modern day and age, all this wait is very unnecessary, tiring, and a bit demotivating given the esteem of the brand. Upon checking with the front desk officer, we would be replied: sorry please wait for your turn there are a few people first. Like an actual food court, not 6 star hotel. The experience to go to Diamond tower is also a bit confusing, but it takes only a little bit to get used to how to navigate the building. The room is fortunately nicely planned, with modern bathroom fit out. Can’t fault the room and room services. Overall my only comment is the complexity of the check in / out process.

I had some flight issues that kept changing, and the staff went above and beyond to make sure everything was smooth for our arrival (which all happened at different times). The pools were beautiful and had great views, and had the bonus of being open 24 hours, which was a nice and unexpected bonus! I would recommend this hotel for a family looking for large, apartment-style rooms who like quiet in the evening and don't care about nightlife.The only reason this is a 4* review instead of 5* is purely based on location and how quiet (aka boring) the hotel was in the evenings. Although our room was high up and gave us views of the beach, we were very far from it. Furthermore, the hotel bar closed very early and there was absolutely no one around in the evening. Waikiki is a fun place and there were lots of bars down the street, but the Ritz was just a littttttle too far to be convenient to either the beach or nightlife. We were young women and it wasn't the most exciting place to stay. But it is a beautiful hotel and the staff was amazing!","Toronto, Canada","angelinaballerina6</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",7,4.0

I am on the road a TON and usually never unpack as it's just easier to literally live out of my suitcase. My flight landed around lunch time, I was in an Uber, got checked in, and up to my room efficiently. My plan was to drop my bag, run to the beach, take a swim/float, and get to a late afternoon meeting.The game changer for me was that I fell in LOVE with my room (original tower, 10th floor, deluxe ocean view, studio, 1 King, sofa bed, balcony). So much so that I unpacked to the point that my suitcase is put away empty. In Waikiki I have stayed at the Marriott, Courtyard, Embassy Suites, Prince, and Hilton Hawaiian Village -- this property is aces for specific reasons to what I love in a hotel experience. I'm writing this review about 19 hours after checking in and still learning but just had to share how lucky it feels to be experiencing this brand of love so far. You arrive a level below the front desk check-in. Maria was lovely and was one of several and took me up to registration and handed me over. Mary Jane at the front desk was efficient and attuned to the joy of her ""office"" view. I did notice that cold towels and mini-pink beverages of some sort were being presented to some but it was a bit busy and Mary Jane was pretty swift so I didn't connect to that. I am attaching photos of the washer/dryer as that was one thing that I had been chirping about to my pals or any one who would listen as the thing i was most curious about. I've been on the road, so after unpacking I did my first wash. So fun!!!Other reviews have pictures and thoughts on the room so I won't be redundant. I will say that the space/layout is unique and so you might find yourself walking back and forth orienting to the length/size of the room. Also the balcony is one that has privacy. You can be out there without someone from the left or right looking right at you. I have friends and family on island and usually meet up with them at favorite restaurants. The wonder of this room is that we will likely go to the Dean & DeLuca (7 am to 9 pm) downstairs and takeout so that we can visit in my little living room slice of wonderfulness! Giddy with the fact that I am an ice fan and that the ice maker creates this fun sized ice. Easy turn off button in case the sound of it dropping occasionally would wake you.Also, regarding the walk to the beach - first, the black bag with two towels is great (thank you Trechnet - I know I am spelling it wrong and blaming it on jet lag :) -- who hipped me to the bag, directions, and well wishes for fun! I will recycle the towels and use a beach bag for day two as it was so handy for day one but think I'll use mine to fit more things. The kiosk at the beach that isn't related to the Ritz but very helpful explained the lounger/umbrella system. It seems like for about $35 ish I could be set up for a good part of the day with a lay down chair and umbrella. There was an outdoor shower and bathroom in the area directly down Saratoga from the hotel. Finally, others have mentioned Sumin Lee and this expanded review would not be complete without special mention as well! Having someone who I could be in touch with by email before, during, and after is incredibly valuable to me. Travelling solo on this trip and it makes all the difference to have a sense of community. Globally I have had the beauty of staying at pretty remarkable properties but can easily say that the word that came up for me regarding this property is UNPARALLELED. D Chang, GM, Jedi leadership!Hope some of this helps for anyone trying to decide on what their slice of aloha will look like! Very likely I will be here if you choose this property because I MIGHT NEVER LEAVE :)","San Francisco, California","b0nnie143</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",16,5.0

The Ritz Carlton Residences are indeed bordering on perfect. Great greeting by the porte-cochere staff. Followed by guest relations smiling face who led us to the lobby for check in. Handed a POG each. That is the traditional non alcoholic passionfruit, orange and guava juice. Check in was easy than taken by another smiling face to our junior suite on level 23. Great views over Waikiki. Bed superbly comfortable. Heated toilet seat and even in a hot climate, was an added botty bonus. Plenty of hanging space. Fridge, oven, toaster, coffee machine, washing machine/dryer suited my wife and I perfectly. Beautiful bed linen and toweling. I could go on and on. Two pools, shade for those who are sensitive to the sun and plenty of UVs for those who like to tan.Pool staff are excellent, efficient, good looking and smiling all the time.Overall, you get my drift......this place is perfection and if you haven't been before, give it a go.

Words cannot adequately describe the wonderful experience we had here. From the moment we stumbled out of the taxi to be greeted with leis and a smoothie, this was an incredible property.They were cheerfully able to accommodate our request for an early check-in.

The room service was fast and delish. And the complimentary beach towels and water bottles at the concierge made our beach visit perfect.And a very special shout-out to Sumin Lee who helped to coordinate the delivery of some very important prescription drugs for my daughter, and gave me so much peace of mind knowing that this sensitive and crucial aspect of our stay was handled with care and professionalism.

I stayed at this property April 29th to May 4th, five nights using 240,000 Marriott Points. As some of you may know, if you book five nights you pay for four nights and get the fifth night free. So even though it costs 60,000 points a night it actually breaks down to 48,000 points a night which is a bargain considering suites go from $500-$800 a night.The second caveat is that I was there to decompress after a death in the family two months ago and I just needed to get away. I have previously been to Oahu and done all of the tourist things so the main purpose of this trip was to relax and have some good local food.I travel extensively though I have never stayed at Ritz Carlton property before. After this trip it would be hard to stay anywhere else.So that being said, I will begin my review in my usual style of Pros and Cons:PROS1. The employees. From Tomoko and Josh at the Front Desk, to Robin, Sequoia and Ocean at the pool to Wes in the bar, an outstanding group of individuals. Not only are they always pleasant to the guests, their interaction with each other is unique as well. Never have I been around so many friendly, wonderful outgoing individuals.2. My Suite. I was on the 22nd floor of the Diamond Tower which is the slightly newer of the two buildings. Traveling by myself I had plenty of room and I could have easily brought two friends and we would all have been comfortable. Two HD TV's, a super comfortable king bed, and separate small living area with a pull out sofa, a stunning bathroom with glass shower, soaking tub, dual sinks, and a bidet. 3. Also included in my suite was a washer/dryer which meant I was able to pack very light. A refrigerator, microwave/oven, dishes, silverware etc, wine glasses; all top quality items. A Nespresso machine and coffee pods which were restocked every day.4. The lanai was huge and the views of the water every day was pristine. 5. There are two pools, one for adults only. There are only about 30 lounges but there was always one available. There were two hot tubs anchoring the pools.6. A great fitness center with everything for a great workout (which I did daily). All the equipment was new and in perfect working order.7. Approximate 10 minute walk to the beach through the park across the street.8. Even though you are in Waikiki it was very quiet at this hotel.Additional positives:At 3 pm each day they serve a (very) small cup of ice cream at the kids pool. The flavor of the day is a locally made Hawaiian ice cream.From 3 pm-6 pm each day, cocktails, beer, wine, small bites and salads are half price at the pool. For $8.00 you receive an excellent cocktail.High speed internet is free and available to all guests.NO RESORT FEEAdditionally, after you book this property you receive an email from customer service asking information about your arrival time and flight information. When I advised them I would not be getting to the hotel until around 9 pm. I was advised they would put a snack in the refrigerator as I might be hungry. That ""snack"" of fruit, cheese, chips, olives, meat and honey took me three days to finish.When you arrive to check in you get a refreshing tropical beverage.CONS:Just to nitpick only a couple.Strangely, there was no clock in my room. I had to ask twice for one and once they provided it, it didn't glow so if the room was dark you had no idea what time it was.In the fitness center, in addition to every piece of cardio equipment having a TV, there are two large screen TV's for individuals lifting weights. However, there was no remote control to change the channels. After asking for a remote for a couple of days and not getting one, I would bring one of the two remotes from my suite which worked just fine.I believe valet parking was $40 a night. I rented a car for one day $42 through Costco and parked on the Ala Wei Canal for free. You really don't need a car in Waikiki and their public transportation system is wonderful $2.75 one way or $5.50 for an all day pass. The transit system goes all over the island and to all the tourist destinations.I could do a whole separate review on restaurants, but if you need specifics email me and I will let you know. I can tell you that I only ate in local places usually within two miles of the hotel for dirt cheap and wonderful food.In conclusion two things. If you are a Marriott member, especially using points, this is hands down the best value on the island for the best service imaginable. I saw the other properties and for a few points less I wouldn't waste my time.Second. Even though it never has occurred to me to spend $500 a night at a hotel, I would do so at this property if I don't have enough points when I come back. It was that remarkable.Cheers!Marius",San Francisco,"Marius40</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco</strong>",225,5.0

However, we were so pleased we picked this hotel and the lack of a beach or large pool was no issue at all.We spent 4 nights at the Ritz using points. With Waikiki beach so over run with tourists and given that it’s a public beach with no alcohol (so no Mai Tai’s in your beach chair), we didn’t miss the beach at all. However, if you want a beach chair the concierge will set it up for you. We spent a couple of days lounging around the adult pool. And thank goodness for an adult only pool since there were so many families. The service at the pool was top notch- cocktail and food were both fantastic! We never had any issue getting two loungers, even thought the hotel was full since it was a big Japanese holiday week. However, I saw larger groups of 4+ have problems getting chairs since the pool area is small.The rooms all have great views of the beach, Diamondhead, and the city skyline. The beds are wonderful. Bathrooms are spacious, with great Japanese toilets. We also took advantage of the in-room washer and drier and left at the end of our trip with a bag of clean clothes.You are easy walking distance to great shopping, the beach, and some of the beachfront hotels and restaurants.I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Waikiki- especially if you only have a couple of nights in town before moving on to one of the other islands or a cruise.",Washington,"melanies284</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington</strong>",88,5.0

We stayed at the Marriott Ko Olina earlier this week and despite a great location, were disappointed with the lack of quality. Moving to the ritz before our departure back home to California was a perfect end to the week. Everything from checkin experience, to upgrade options, to service in dining / bar facilities has been perfect. The room itself is usually outstanding quality. We had a 2 bed suite which is more than big enough for my wife and I and 2 kids. The kitchen is larger than you’d expect for a hotel, with large living area and dining table in the kitchen. Really well equipped with dishwasher and washing machine and dryer. To quote my eldest daughter (aged 10), “Now this is more like it Daddy, why didn’t we just stay here all week”.While location isn’t perfect (a short walk from the beach), i’ll be staying here on future trips to Oahu since you really can’t get this experience in terms of customer service at a Marriott vacation club property.

(But you pay the price, obviously). There's not a single aspect of this hotel that could prompt any sort of criticism (on my part - obviously, there are plenty of high-brow critics here, judging by some comments). Contemporary design everywhere, high class just floating in the air, exceptionally well-trained and welcoming personnel, convenient location, spotless appearance, nice smell everywhere, all the little things like ""oh, we see you are going to the beach, here's a beach bag with towels and water for you"", room service twice a day, etc., etc.We lived in a KS+retractable sofa room. It was spacious, with a sliding partition converting it into two bedrooms - with individual large-screen TVs in each. The bathroom was spacious, too, stocked with high-quality toiletries of every possible kind, open-space design with toilet separated by a semi-transparent door and equipped with a ""Japanese"" lid (you know, with bells and whistles and remote control). We also had a balcony - big enough to host two chez-longues and a coffee table.The sleep quality was very good, even the convertible sofa felt like a proper bed. I have no idea what noise some people are complaining about - unless you sleep with the balcony door open, you won't hear traffic.The room was fully equipped for a long stay: fully stocked kitchen (stove, oven, fridge, appliances, kitchenware - the only thing missing was a microwave), a washer and a dryer (!) and an adequate kitchen top. This was definitely a highlight of our stay because we were not restricted to going out for breakfast or dinner.They have a decent pool, a spa and a gym. The gym was not as big as I'd expected, but still equipped well: 11 cardio machines, 5 strength machines, a full rack of dumbbells and a HIIT island with pulleys, harnesses, balls and even a punching bag. And, of course, stocked with chilled bottled water, dry and wet towels, disposable earphones, etc.The place absolutely deserves top marks, without reservation.

A manager came up to check it out and we got switched promptly. A small hiccup to still an awesome stay. They had activities of a mochi making in bottom floor and drum. Nice fitness room and yoga room. Two pools which are clean and nicely attended. Famous sushi omakase need reservation for at hotel also. Also had ice cream at the pool they were giving out when we went. The location was like a double edged sword. It is basically right on top of the street where all the main stores and shopping areas are for Honolulu and although it is not on the beach, it is walking distance which could be difficult with two small kids. 5 month and a 22 month. They have a bag with towels and water you can get from front desk if you ask.To sum it up: I have stayed in several places in Honolulu- Hale Koa, Moana Surfrider, turtle beach resort in north shore, and outrigger Waikiki on the beach.

If you are here to explore Oahu, and plan on spending minimal time in the room and don’t mind a pool with a distant ocean view- this is the place for you. If you’re looking for a resort getaway away from city noise- stay somewhere else. My husband and I were looking for a long weekend getaway to enjoy with a beautiful hotel room, a nice view, a beautiful pool to spend some adult time. They have a beautiful pool, and an ocean view. However, between you and that beautiful view are a few blocks of Waikiki, which we knew. What we failed to anticipate is that those few blocks were the difference between beach and ocean vs city traffic and noise. We love relaxing on the balcony with a drink to watch the sunset, but if you try that here, the sunset will be accompanied with the loud noise of rush hour traffic and ambulances, fire trucks and construction. We came here to escape the city, not to be confronted by it from our room. We stayed in the new tower, and though the room was very comfortable- we were surprised that they would build a place with tiny and shallow bathtubs and old shower heads that lacked water pressure. At $600 a night, I feel like that’s a basic ask. More importantly, if you have a late flight and want to relax at the hotel pool for the day until it’s time to fly out, this isn’t be the best choice hotel. We are platinum elite, so that gives us the extra benefit of having 4 ok checkout when available. Since we had a 4:45 pm reservation nearby for sunset drinks, we asked if we could stay until 4:30 so we could max out on pool time before we leave. They couldn’t accommodate that, which is completely fair. We aren’t entitled to more time. So we said we’d be happy to check out earlier if we can just shower and get cleaned up in the hospitality suite or courtesy room- except... they don’t have one. I’m sorry- but a 5* hotel in a beach town like Honolulu, that doesn’t have a hospitality suite for changing and cleaning up before leaving? I’ve stayed at grand Wailea, four seasons (on multiple islands), all those hotels understand the importance of a hospitality suite for guests who are willing to checkout early but just need a place to cleanup and change out before they head out for a later flight. This is an island vacation, after all. It’s crazy to me that the Ritz doesn’t offer this pretty standard 5* amenity. Also- they don’t do Bloody Mary’s at the bar. Credit to the bar staff for trying to put together a concoction for me off menu with tomato juice... but... really?!? Again- this feels nitpicky but c’mon I’m not asking for the exotic here, and I’m paying premium for room and drinks. Last complaint- you have 3 pools. Please designate one as adult only. Recommend the medium size pool with the water lounge chairs, so if adults want to be close to their kids at the slide, they can do that. But other adults can still enjoy their drinks on the water lounge chairs without loud splashing kids spraying chlorine water into their drinks. If they need more room to play games, give them the largest pool by the E bldg. they’re kids. They’re allowed to have fun and enjoy the pool - it’s the best part of a hotel stay for the kids. But leave your adult guests who want a kid free time to have an area where they can be adults without the shrieking and splashing. Four seasons does this. Why is this also such a foreign concept for the Ritz? 3 stars instead of 1 because their pool staff and housekeeping staff is awesome, and their overall customer service is typical of a Ritz Carlton. Beds are also very comfortable. Unfortunately (or fortunately) we will not be staying here in the future or recommending it to our friends unless it’s their first time in Oahu and they’re here to play tourists, not relax.

From the moment we drove up to check in, we were welcomed with the aloha spirit. We were greeted with leis and they offered to take our luggage. We only had 2 carry-on bags, so we insisted they let us take it ourselves. We were eager to change and get into some more comfortable clothes rather than wait on them to bring it up for us. While we were checking in at the desk, we were offered tropical drinks with the option of adding rum. I favored out as I'm not big on drinking during the day. Either way, it was still delicious.When we walked into our room, there were some treats like macadamia nuts and chocolate dipped potato chips. They were amazing. Just want you wanted after a long flight. We quickly changed and checked out the room's amenities which were as fancy as they come. The views from the balcony were amazing. We left the door open and watched the sunrise and sunset every day we were here. The room service was spectacular too. Being from Florida, our jet lag was awful the first night. We woke up at 4:00 ready to start the day. After waiting a couple of hours, we ordered room service sent it started at 6:00 AM. The food was amazing. Our host that brought it in was so sweet. We caught him around the hotel every now and again and we always stopped to talk to him. He was so sweet. Shane with the bluest of eyes.A couple nights later, my boyfriend (at the time) surprised me by proposing to me on the top of a mountain on our trip. When we came back to the hotel, we were surprised with a bottle of champagne in the fridge and a card signed by all the people we'd encountered on our trip there so far. Granted, he emailed back and forth with their staff before this trip, but it was still a nice touch. They could've given us a blanket congratulations card and had one person's signature stamped on it, but they didn't. They handwrote the card and all signed it. It was beautiful. I still have it in my house to look at and reminisce.Even the valet attendants when we'd take our car out to travel around the island, they'd ask us about where we're going and give us tips for our trip there. Eddie would always give us water wherever we went too because ""it gets hot out there."" It was such a sweet sentiment that I called him my big brother after a while.I can't say enough about how wonderful this place is and how much they take care of you from start to finish. You're only about a 5 minute walk from the beach, so don't worry about that either.

I finally decided that it would be unfair to other properties to give this one a higher rating, because, even with all the positives, the things the Ritz-Carlton failed at are unfortunately significant and, given the pattern shown, unlikely to be changed.Let's start from the beginning...The location is definitely convenient -- especially given the demographic they are going for. Having said that Honolulu is not exactly a big City, and there is one massive downside to the location, which is the constant noise. Construction noise, traffic, noise, etc. Not only the noise cannot be avoided when at the pool or restaurants, the worst part -- and where my first gripe begins -- I can't be avoided in the rooms either; for some inexplicable reason even the newest tower lacks properly soundproofed windows, which is inexcusable for a high end luxury property that was just built. The result is that even in spite of very comfortable beds, and very modern, silent, central A/C, the street noise just permeates through the rooms -- yes, even in the 25th floor. Even at night. I can't really fathom what they were thinking when they chose to not use Soundproof Sliding Glass Doors. ... and for me not getting a good night's sleep due to the noise is really an essential component of my rating. So even though the room we got was otherwise brand new, impeccable, beautifully designed and furnished, with high end appliances and everything, the lack of Soundproof Sliding Glass Doors is just to big of a sin to ignore.... but unfortunately that's not all.As I've written in some of my other reviews, one really pics a Ritz-Carlton (or a Fairmont, or a Four Seasons) for the legendary service. In this trip in particular -- because it was for Valentine's Day -- my expectations for service where extremely high. I contacted the Concierge team way before my stay, and set up several things through them. I have to say the Concierge team was a delight to work with before my stay -- they were responsive, polite, helpful, professional and extremely resourceful. They are, in fact, why I struggle with giving the RCWB an average rating; if I could rate them separately I would give them 5 starts.Unfortunately once I arrived the problems started pretty early and quickly.My first issue was with my bags; even though I was very clear with the front desk staff that I needed my bags brought up quickly and I had one hour before my dinner reservation and needed to shower and change clothes, there were no signs of the bags after me waiting for them for 30 minutes. I called the front desk at that point -- and 20 minutes after that (total wait time: 50 minutes) my bags finally showed up, giving me 10 minutes to shower, change and get to my restaurant. That was not a good way to start the stay.Now, they did realize they had messed up, and later that night I did get a very nice apology note accompanied by what I swear were the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever had in my life. I almost called downstairs and asked them where they got those cookies -- which actually I almost think were home baked -- so I can buy them every time I come back to Honolulu.The apology was so good and the cookies so awesome I was willing to forgive them at that point.But then a pattern began...The next day -- Valentine's Day -- the flowers I had ordered showed up over an hour late (and timing was important, since we needed to leave). Didn't get an explanation or apology for that. Although I'm willing to accept that it may have been a problem with the vendor, the fact that was zero communication during or after the mishap is highly problematic; I am aware the Concierge was likely not around that morning but in that case they should have made sure somebody on the staff was aware of the request, handling it and communicating with me as we (patiently) waited. Then later that afternoon they showed up to do special turn down service 2 hours before the time I specifically requested months in advance (because, again, timing was important...). They did make up for that -- after I repeated my request for a specific time for the turndown, the service team did come back at the right time and did a spectacular job with the ""extras"" I had requested for turndown (basically a few special Valentine's Day requests); however the fact that I had to be interrupted to explain to them again a request I had clearly made (and got confirmation of, in writing) is off-putting.I'm still willing to accept that for two of the mistakes they did make up for it, but for the flowers one the lack of any explanation or apology and the fact that it had such a negative impact on our plans really is the reason I took out another star.Given how many open positions they are advertising, I suspect they may be a little understaffed.Also, although I was really impressed with the food at the The Market restaurant (where we had breakfast), the second day was a complete letdown service wise.Ultimately: although this is still likely the poshest property in Waikiki, there's a tremendous amount of work they need to do to deserve 5 stars from me: one, they need to get those Soundproof Sliding Glass Doors, and two they need to increase the timeliness and consistency of the service, definitely by increasing staff, and potentially working on their communication.Finally: it's valet only parking but I have to say the valet team was the one team that never, even let me down the whole stay, they are absolutely outstanding.","San Francisco, California","FSFan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",143,3.0

Amentities: Outstanding fitness center. Beautiful infinity pool with cabanas, 2 full bars.Service: everyone was outstanding - friendly and efficient without being pretentious. Other: We stayed in the newer, Diamond Head tower, which was nice, but was a little bit of an out of the way trek to get to.","San Francisco, California","LawrenceJ828</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",11,5.0

The whole experience was luxurious and the service amazing. Our room faced the ocean and our balcony was awesome to sit on and just soak in the evenings. They did the balconies correctly by making them all glass so no bars to spoil the view. We were in the D tower (which stands for the Diamond Head view) and so had to go up an elevator and then walk a bit and up another elevator. The elevators at this place are very new and you actually have to use your room key and punch in where you are headed before you enter as there are NO buttons inside the elevator. The concierge was conveniently located on our way to our room if we had any needs at all. The outside bar area was really fun and the bartender extremely friendly, nice place for a happy hour. I just felt like they totally took care of us the whole time we were there and our room was quiet and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend it again.

New property: We stayed in the Diamond Head Tower which was very clean. 2. Nice Gym: Lots of cardio machines and weights. They supply water bottles, towels, and earbuds.3. Great Location: Close to luxury row, beach, and multiple dining options4. Happy hour at hotel from 3-6pm: Delicious food options and generous drinks 5. Every day at 3pm, they hand out ice cream by the pool: flavors include coconut, taro, and pineapple mochi6. Beautiful view of the sunset every night Cons:1. On the day of our departure, they called us at 11:59pm to ""remind"" us it was check out- As we were zipping up our luggage, they called us to let us know we needed to leave because a guest of the owner is staying in our room after us and they need to get it ready.2. Understaffed in some areas, overstaffed in others. There are 2-4 people in the less utilized concierge area, but only 1 staff member in the very busy pool area. 3. All 3 pools are crowdedAlthough they say that one ""serenity pool"" is for adults only no one actually monitors this. There are children splashing, playing marco polo, and screaming in every pool. 4. Pool side serviceArrived at our Diamond Head Tower pool at 11am and planned to hang out for the day. We ordered food from Shelby. She brought the wrong order, which is fine because it was busy. Immediately upon delivering our correct order, she brought us our check. We never asked for the check and planned to order more food through out the day. We later overheard that she was planning on leaving work early and wanted to close our tab but then she was asked to stay on by the manager. We didn't feel comfortable opening another tab with her so we just walked over to the Horizons Grill each time we wanted to order something. 5. They do tours for certain airline companies, who take pictures of you when you are working our or poolside without asking6. Strange room design- Very little closet space, but a huge washer and dryer unit- Full kitchen which takes up a lot of room in such a small space. - Bathroom design is not co-inhabitant friendly. It is an open plan with wooden shades that can close off the bathroom from the room itself. There is 1 light switch that lights up the entire bathroom. The toilet is in a separate enclave that has no light, so it is dark in there. 7. The stones on the pools kept coming loose.During our stay, EMT services was called on 2 separate occasions because patrons would cut themselves on parts of the pool that would fall off. In sum, the Ritz Carlton Residences is trying very hard to provide a 5 star service. Though its amenities are in line with the Ritz brand, the service is lacking. Its seems like they may have hired some high school students to wait on their guests. At 5 star prices, we expect a bit more hospitality.","San Francisco, California","LuxLife103</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",17,3.0

But this one is special, I could not stop thinking about sharing the fabulous experience I got with every one of you even during my busiest time, as it's simply AMAZING.My wife and I stayed in this hotel at the end of September for our wedding on Oahu island. Before going there, I spent quite some time looking for where to stay and this hotel stood out due to the great reviews on TripAdvisor, especially for its outstanding service. So I booked a room and wrote an email to tell them the purpose of my stay. They responded promptly and generously offered me a room upgrade. They also thoroughly answered my questions about their SPA service as I wanted my wife to be fully relaxed and refreshed on the wedding day.  The communication made me feel very well treated.  The check-in was smooth, we were warmly welcomed by the front desk and were told our room was upgraded to a suite. We were astonished when we entered the room. The room was well prepared for us! They offered a bottle of sparkling wine with a congrats card and flower peddles around the bucket.  They decorated the room with tons of flowers and candles as you can see from the picture. What you can’t see is there actually was a path made with peddles that lead to the bed from the living room. Everything was so beautiful and romantic. We were so touched when we saw all of those as we could tell they care about us and they wanted us to have the best memories during the stay. When we were still immersed in the feeling of being spoiled, we found a lovely chocolate cake hidden in the fridge which surprised us even more! The room itself is gorgeous as others already stated. We especially liked the patio which is huge and facing the ocean with splendid view, as you can tell from my photo. My wife went to the SPA shortly after we checked in. Her words describe the experience is “Absolutely Perfect”. She told me that besides the treatment I ordered, they even offered her a treatment specifically for Bride free of charge! The bed was extremely comfortable, we both had a great night and rested very well for our big day. All the staff we met were super friendly and well trained. There is one man we’d like to thank particularly, his name is Josh. I was having difficulties wearing a bow tie, the stylist didn’t know how to wear a self-tie bow tie either, so I called the front desk asking for help. They checked their staff, unfortunately, no one knew how to do it. The photographers were about to arrive, but I didn’t have the bow tie ready, I was in a total panic. Then Josh came. He started learning how to wear a bow tie via YouTube, practiced on himself and worked together with me and successfully put a cute little bow tie on my neck. He saved my day. After everything was done, I was trying to find some cash to tip him, but he told me “It’s OK Xiao, my wife is also from China, we’re family, please keep the money for your wedding.” At that moment, he was like an angle to us. I will save the words on other nice things that other people have already mentioned in their reviews. All in all, I will recommend the Ritz-Carlton Residences, Waikiki Beach to everyone for its incredibly awesome service.  As for us, we will come back every couple of years as it's no longer a great hotel, it’s part of the best memories of our life.",,xyuan666,2,5.0

All the excitement of Waikiki is within easy walking distance, whereas the hotel itself is an oasis of peace and quiet.The suite was beautiful, very clean with comfortable bed, kitchenette, and all the comforts one expects from this brand.The employees are well-trained, friendly, and seem to take a personal interest in the well-being of their guests.The place may feel a bit 'sterile' compared to the traditional Hawaiian hotels, which may be due to its new condition. For us not a big deal considering the excellent quality of the suite. I assume that, with time, the hotel will add a finishing touch with a few Hawaiian features here and there.The pool restaurant is nice and has the usual cocktails and comfort foods.The second restaurant looks very modern, and did not appeal to us.

We opted for the studio for the two of us and it was more room than we needed. Extremely well planned out and thoughtful considerations for space. We used the kitchen to make minor meals, the refrigerator worked well keeping things cold and we loved the washer and dryer setup. Large bathrooms with a spacious double sink and my favorite Toto toilets which as doubled as a bidet. Property is quiet and soundproofing very good by Honolulu standards. Coffee pods by nepresso provided. Staff were always seeking to help in any way and whatever you asked they wanted to help. The property is two blocks from the beach but there is very little sand left along this part of Waikiki so we hung out at one of two pools or went off to other beaches out of the tourist strip for peace and stunning views.My only complaint is that their restaurants were disappointing overall and expensive. So after a semi warm breakfast and disappointing pool side snack we just went off property to eat. Finally, I did not understand why such a premium property did not offer beach chairs like the other hotels do in that star category. Very odd.

From the moment we entered the property until we left, we were given the royal treatment! Smiling, helpful, very professional staff added great value to our experience! As soon as we arrived, the attendants approached us with a smile and offered to take our bags and to escort us up in the elevator to the lobby. I don't think we could have gotten up to the lobby without assistance, though, cause I believe they had to use their keycard in the elevator. We were then greeted by a lovely lady, Moko, who was very welcoming and put lovely lei's on our necks! What a pleasant surprise and very nice touch as she also handed us cool, wet towels and a welcome drink! What a way to greet guests! They nailed it from the beginning to end! Then, Ally, the front desk agent, who checked us in was very kind and had a great demeanor! We were very thankful for the upgrade and early check in! We also were given great assistance at the front desk by Josh and other staff including the operator, during our stay! We did have to change rooms a couple times due to the refrig not working in our first room; the second room didn't have a true king bed, so we were kindly moved to a third room which had a true king bed (instead of two twins pushed together); each room was excellent although I did notice a couple slight differences...one room didn't have a dishwasher... and the sheets in the higher floor room were even nicer, if that is possible! Since the rooms are actually residences with their own respective owners, maybe the owners of each room set the rooms up with varying options. I must mention that the toliets in the rooms were simply amazing! High tech at it's best (heated/nightlight...!). It's nice that the room refrig is stocked with as much water as you like, just advise the concierge or housekeeping. The rooms are fully equipped and is more like a lovely condo! Our room was in the brand new (2 week old) Diamond Head Tower and it was amazing! We were escorted from the main lobby to the pool area to await our room. The infinity pool is simply amazing and everything anyone could wish for in a pool with a great view of the city! Service was great and I do believe the young lady who helped us most was named Ocean. Everyone who assisted us were very kind and thoughtful. One of the corner cabanas which we utilized for the day was a very nice treat which added to the amazing ambiance! The cabana had a mounted tv, stocked mini frig, and very comfy lounge chairs. The cabana structure was cherry wood, I think, and it was very upscale looking! Apples, towels and infused water was available as a courtesy in the pool areas, which was a nice treat, too!The gym is very nice (new equipment) and I especially liked the punching bag, but, would have liked if they provided boxing gloves. I had to wrap towels around my hands to get in a few hits on the bag! Water, wet/cool towels, earplugs, and apples are provided which is very nice, too!We ordered lunch while at the pool and it was very good! The price was a bit high as to be expected...they use Waygu beef for the burgers! The bread was good, and the fries were good, too! We also went out on the town for burgers and they didn't even compare to the burgers at The Ritz!We used points for the first two nights and paid over $600 for the third night! It was very expensive to us, given that it was way outta our normal budget, but, I must admit, it was well worth the memories being made here! I am on the lookout for any future deals at this property or off peak prices, because this is one of my absolute favorites!I am a bit disappointed that we didn't take advantage of the turndown service. It would be nice if this was shared at checkin. I saw pictures of another person's turndown and their chocolates, and I was sad that I missed this little treat and getting my room refreshed. My fault for not asking for it and for having the do not disturb on my door, though. Next time, though, I'm gonna take advantage of every little treat offered, ijs, lol!Oh, we stayed a couple nights down the street at the Marriott hotel which is right across the street from the beach; we like staying there which is more in our price range! The Ritz is about a 10-15 walk to the beach but it is near all the high-end shopping spots right near Luxury Row; it's also near a lot of restaurants! The Marriott is an old property and the rooms could use updating but it is very clean and the lobby is a very nice relaxing spot as are the other amenities on the property! Lastly, I must mention that there was a strike going on from Marriott workers, and, had we known beforehand, we certainly would not have stayed here until after the strike, out of respect. I hope the Marriott brand hotels and the workers (the Union) can come to a fair/good solution for all involved...I love the Marriott brand of hotels!","Seattle, Washington","Faye S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",4,5.0

Husband and I stayed for 8 days. Upon arrival we were greeted by guest relations who walked us to the front desk and gave us a refreshing welcome drink which was delicious. The reservations staff checked us in and walked us to the new tower where we were staying. We booked a one bedroom deluxe suite and the view was just amazing. It has an open concept living room kitchen, a bedroom with bathroom and to my surprise there was a second bathroom which I ended up using despite having plenty of space in the main bathroom. Bathroom has a powerful hairdryer - bring your own flat iron, ladies! The place is pretty much an apartment which was awesome! Kitchen is all set up with dishes and great coffee. Bed was comfortable. Noise level at night - you can hear some of the street noise ( wear ear plugs if sensitive to noise or use a nature noise app - that is what I did and slept well) - we went to bed early by 10pm - noise was not every night. Service - Staff provided great customer service. Guest relations took care of all my reqests prior to arrival. Location - I loved the location. Very lively but upscale. Beach is walking distance. There are high end stores and local shops around. Lots of restaurants. Dean Deluca downstairs was great! The view was lovely and best of all you can watch the Friday fireworks from room while drinking some wine! Spa- I used the spa. It was nice and the staff was great. The spa feels like a day spa due to décor being bright instead of dark. The locker room is small but it has everything you need and the wet and dry saunas are there. They added a serenity room to wait which was nice but needs a little more décor on some of the walls to make it more zen. The spa carries great products. Massage therapist listen to all my requests - she was lovely! Pool - Nice but the downside is that the pool has children all over. I didn't use the pool. Room Service - Ordered breakfast twice - Food was great and service was great. However, some inconsistence with service - One staff did observe do not disturb sign and called instead of knocking. Second time around, staff knocked despite sign. Also, food was missing an item - staff did apologize and returned with item - no big deal just inconsistant service. Pool Café - Good drinks, however inconsistent service. One bartender gave same drink in a small glass another bartender made it in a tall glass and made it fancier (properly). Food service seemed slow despite no one else seated at café. Food was ok not great/wow - had issue with the temperature of the sashimi which was lukewarm room temperature when it should be cold, the other items (poke and toke) were the right temperature. Needless to say, I didn't eat the sashimi. I think they need to up their game with the pool menu and train the young staff to apply all the upscale service one expects despite being by the pool. My waitress at the café chatting with the bartender and took a while to check on me. I eventually informed front desk about food issue - was informed that they would inform dining manager but I don't know if that took place since we didn't hear from anyone. Overall, I love the hotel, staff and location. Place seems to attract families but being off season it was not a problem for us since we were touring on most days.

There was only one day out of the six days we were there that our room was serviced late and that was also because of limited staff during the expected hurricane.

Around the corner you can catch the pink trolley which takes you to Ala Moana (the largest shopping mall in Hawaii), and a short walk to the T Galleria you can catch other tourist trolleys to Diamond Head, Pearl Harbor etc. One Bedroom Suite - we had a lovely, spacious room (see photos attached) on the 28th floor. We had great view of the ocean all the way from Waikiki's Pink Palace to glimpses of the boat harbour at Ala Moana. The three VERY MINOR things that weren't great about our room was that there was very little pressure in the shower (probably the weakest shower pressure I've ever encountered in a hotel); that there were no hooks to hang our bath towels to dry (I had to drape mine on the toilet door handle, husband would hang his on a coat hanger); and that the pillows were too soft for my liking, and even the ""firm"" ones housekeeping brought up were also very soft. Literally, that was it. Service - exceptional. I was contacted before our stay about any arrangements that could be made prior to our arrival. Everyone we encountered from checking in/ out at the lobby, the concierge, room service etc were fantastic - every staff member went out of their way to make you feel welcome and that any request was no trouble at all. Restaurant & cafe - We loved going to Dean & DeLuca in the afternoons for coffee and snacks. They have a great selection of savoury food, cakes and pastries. We ate at the main restaurant twice. The menu is not huge but what we ate was nice and again the service was exceptional (although on both nights the restaurant was awfully quiet, not sure if that is because guests generally choose to eat out or because we went at a quiet time of year...) Hotel amenities - we didn't use the spa, pool or valet so I cannot comment on those but we regularly used the gym, which had a great selection of machines and equipment. I haven't stayed in any other hotels in Hawaii so I cannot compare, but this is a great hotel with exceptional service and we would definitely recommend it to others.","Sydney, NSW","The_Logocracy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, NSW</strong>",36,5.0

I liked that it is located off a quiet side street, making it easier to get in/out (via car) compared to hotels located in the center of the very busy and crowded Kalakaua Ave. Despite being in a quieter section, it was still within very short walking distance to plenty of excellent shops and restaurants. Though the hotel was not directly on the beach, it was maybe 5 minutes walk to the sand (just go straight down Saratoga Rd).Prior to arrival, I corresponded with Sandy Suzuki from Guest Relations. I initially e-mailed her about reserving dinner at Sushi Sho (highly recommend reserving!!), but soon found her to very helpful in other things, including early check-in, restaurant and activity recommendations and even pre-stocking the refrigerator. She was very responsive and helpful in planning our stay. She was just as nice and helpful when we finally met her in person!Upon arrival, our entire stay lived up to the Ritz-Carlton name. Service from all the staff we encountered were excellent. Everyone was professional, courteous and responsive to any request or question we had. We reserved a one bedroom, which was pristine, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. I learned from prior experience in traveling to Hawaii that a washer/dryer and kitchen are 'must haves' in the room. The kitchen was stocked with a sufficient enough of pots/pans, dishes, utensils, etc. for extended stays. The Nespresso machine and the small water bottles (replenished daily) were added bonuses. The only thing missing I would have liked was a bread knife. After coming back from the sandy beach, hiking muddy trails or just being outside in the tropical sun, it was nice to have fresh, clean clothes throughout our stay! Note: Laundry detergent and dish washing soap & sponges are provided (and replenished, as necessary).If you rent a car, there is a $35/day valet parking fee (no self parking allowed). The valet attendants were super prompt at having your car ready if you call right before leaving the room. At the valet station, they also hand out tote bags with two towels and water bottles or umbrellas, if needed. We had dinner at Sushi Sho and highly recommend reserving well in advanced if you want an amazing sushi experience. The Dean & DeLuca is small, but sufficient if you want espresso drinks, light meals/snacks or pastries. We had lunch at their main restaurant once. The food is good enough if you want something to eat while lounging at the pool or too lazy to walk outside. However, there are way more wonderful restaurants to eat within a few minutes walk away which I would encourage to try instead. With top notch service, accessible location to many amazing restaurants and an in-room kitchen and washer/dryer, I would definitely recommend staying here.

My inquiry to the bell boy if he knew about male therapists at their own spa earned me a phone call from their concierge who had made inquiries at other nearby hotels (since the answer was no!) This is anticipating your customer's needs. The rooms are super spacious, clean and airy and the beds are a dream to sleep in. My son and I spent some time by the pool, where we were welcomed by a super friendly attendant who provided us with a cabana to stay out of the sunshine.The concierge not only organized my massage, they also got us a great table at a local restaurant for dinner with stunning food.

We had booked the The RItz-Carlton Residences Waikiki and initially there was some confusion around the rate. When this was discovered, the Manager of the Residences, Douglas Chang, reached out to us to apologize and explain what happened. He wanted to ensure we had a great experience and said to let him know if we had any questions prior to our arrival.Well, a few weeks before we were set to arrive, we received email(s) from the hotel asking what they could do to make our stay more comfortable and if we had any special / specific requests. Already we knew this stay would be special.When we arrived at the Residences, the first thing we notice is the entrance/motor court. It is like arriving at Fantasy Island. We were greeted by Maria who promptly provided us with traditional Hawaiian necklaces - not your typical flower lei but a necklace crafted from a type of shell or nut (Macadamia I believe) - a definite keepsake. Everyone at the desk greeted us with a smile and a hello. Ahhhhhh our vacation had officially begun.We were then escorted up to the Check in desk where again we were greeted with very friendly smiles and a pleasant frozen drink. Maria bid us a pleasant evening and we were now ready to check in. I have to say we were a bit distracted as the lobby was very elegant and peaceful. With the wide open floor plan you felt like you were standing in an infinity edge lobby (if that is such a thing). Off the lobby were the pool and the restaurant. I appreciated that it is an intimate property where you do not need to walk too far if you want to have a nice meal and/or go for a swim. The restaurant by the way does provide room service.We checked in and unfortunately my husband has very sensitive allergies and he said he smelled smoke in the room (cigarette/cigar). While it was late at night and we were tired from working all day and then flying from San Francisco, he wouldn't be able to sleep with the smell. He called down to the desk and explained.Without another word, they had another suite prepped and cleaned and sent a bellman up to switch our keys and ensure we had what we needed. Understand here that it was late at night and while many other hotels would have let us know that there was no staff available to clean the new room, this issue was never even raised - they took care of us.Once we arrived to our room, we received a knock on the door and low and behold we were brought snacks for the evening to thank us for staying.Now the room was heaven. We had a beautiful suite including a large luxurious bathroom with double sinks (yay - no waiting for each other to get ready). Oh and did I mention a built in refrigerator, cooktop, washer and dryer and more.We quickly settled in and had a wonderful and very restful sleep. The room was quiet, the bed was so comfortable and it was the perfect way to start our week long stay.Each and every morning we were greeted by the Concierge(s), Laurie and Jamie, always with a smile. I must say that every employee of the Residences, would stop to say hello, smile and make us feel as though we were the only guests there.As the week went on, we utilized many of the services offered including complimentary shoe shine, gym, pool, and one day we had our family come over (as they were staying at a hotel nearby) to spend time at the pool.Jamie at the concierge desk arranged a cabana rental for us. The best part about the pool area is that there are only a handful of cabanas and the pool is perfect for laps and is framed on either end by hot tubs. If you do not want to rent a cabana, there are of course chairs around and we never had a problem securing a spot. The Pool staff were wonderful, attentive and so friendly. The minute you walk down the steps to the pool, they are there to help in anyway they can.Note, to our surprise, there was a safe in the cabana and a small refrigerator stocked with some nice refreshments. In our cabana, the safe had been left locked by the previous guest. I mentioned it to Momo and within seconds, a maintenance person was there to help.The cabanas have a drape to close for some privacy and to filter the sun. This was great as our niece wanted to take a nap and she had no problem falling asleep. The pool side service was great - the food was delicious and we never waited very long for anything.Each day, coming and going, we were greeted by the staff who would take a minute and ask how our day was. It was nice to feel so special and welcome. A couple of times we were in our room when housekeeping arrived and they asked if it was okay to clean and while they were cleaning, they engaged in a conversation asking how we were enjoying our stay. Again, perhaps it is the Island way, for everyone to be friendly, but whatever the reason, each staff member went above and beyond.The Residences are located in an awesome spot. Walking distance to the beach, and the high end shops around, made it even more magical. Right downstairs is a Dean and DeLuca which we really love and I must say, having been to others, we were shocked at the prices - not how high but how reasonable. Great assortment of items - but I will save that for another write up.As we were winding down our vacation, on the last day at check out, I happened to ask the Concierge if they had an extra note pad as I love the note pads - a light blue and just the right size. Laurie went and found a couple and gave them to me which made me happy to have a nice memory.Well, a few days after we arrived home, a FedEx showed up. Inside were a bunch of Ritz-Carlton note pads with the sweetest note from Laurie and Jamie.This was by far one of the most amazing stays we have experienced of any of the hotels we have been, around the World. Thank you Ritz-Carlton Residences and we look forward to seeing you again soon.","San Francisco, California","731careyr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",18,5.0

The hotel is only a couple of years old, and from what we’ve seen is by far the most modern. The suite is large enough for 2 adults and 2 kids - both 11 years old. The couch is turned into a bed nightly and put away every morning by staff. All the staff from the pool guys, to the valets, waiting staff and concierge are so helpful and kind, it has really made our stay. Nothing is too much trouble. There is a great restaurant in the hotel serving, breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food is great - something I can’t honestly say for a lot of local restaurants. There is also a great little cafe on the ground floor with the best coffee. Oahu itself can be a little dated (other than the fabulous shopping -Luxury Row is literally at the great floor of the hotel), so the Ritz is a welcome addition. Of course perfection is difficult and subjective so...the air con is great in the living room but with no separate control, it’s only around 50% effective in the bedroom. It made sleeping a little uncomfortable for us in the main bedroom as we had to turn off the a/c as it was too cold left on for the kids. The pool is a little small for a family hotel but we never had an issue getting beds or a cabana.

I have also stayed at the Trump and there is no comparison. The personalized service at this property puts it in a league of it’s own. It is immaculately clean with every amenity imaginable. The unobstructed views of the ocean & mountains will literally take your breath away. There is no better location for a great view of Diamond Head and Waikiki beach. The property is not right on beach but is a short five minute walk away. They provide beach bags with towels and bottled water every time you leave the property. Every time you enter the property at the front drive you will be greeted by some of the nicest happiest people I have ever met in my life. It is obvious everyone who works here loves their job and takes great pride in the level of service they provide their guest. They anticipate your needs and meet them with a smile on their face.

However, it was taken to a new level at this property. Our departing flight was cancelled after nearly three hours of sitting on the plane. I immediately called the property to see if we could come back to our original residence. On the phone was the nicest and most helpful staff member I have ever encountered at a Ritz Carlton. His name was Gavin. He not only told us to come back he came and picked up my family of five and nine pieces of baggage in his personal mini van. This was at the end of his shift at 1030 PM. He arrived at the Honolulu Airport just as we walked out with our bags and greeted us with a smile on his face and helped to load all the bags. He took us to the property and personally took the bags to our room and even had our coffee preference in the room for the next morning. He had the room cleaned and all of our preferences in place upon arrival. This is the type of service you can expect from the Ritz Carlton Waikiki Residences and the accommodations are amazing.

My earlier review was rejected because it had comparisons to another luxury hotel located between this hotel and the beach which shall remain unnamed, however, it had been a family favorite of ours for the last three years for President's week in Feb. With my mother in law and two teenage daughters we rented the two bedroom unit. It was nicely laid out and made efficient use of the space. The kitchen, although compact, had really nice high end appliances. The unit also had an ocean view. The Westin Heavenly beds with the down topper is super comfortable, my daughter who slept on the sofa bed also had one that made it more comfortable so she didn't feel the springs. The property is quiet and luxurious and service level is very good. We had a car and it was always ready and waiting for us when we called for it. The elevators are very fast, the security is good and the algorithms help allocate the fastest one for you. There is very little waiting. The gym is very nice, roomy, well equipped and has nice bright windows. It's a little bit of a walk to Waikiki beach but we used the car to go to local beaches which had good parking. I called a rental company earlier and had umbrellas and chairs delivered to the hotel that we kept in the car for the beach time. The hotel is well situated for the shopping, dining and entertaining evenings on Kalakaua Avenue. It's really become a world class shopping and dining destination over the last five years.

What follows is a long and detailed review so read on at your own risk! We considered the Four Seasons at Ko Olina and others before settling on the Ritz Carlton Residences. Reading the reviews for the hotel prior to arrival, I was confident in the choice but had a few concerns. These concerns were the location not being beachside, the size of the pool, and the ongoing construction of the second tower. I'm happy to report that these concerns were unwarranted in my experience. First, the location was near perfection. Yes, it is not beachside but the beach is just a two block walk away. In fact, we preferred to walk down the beach a few minutes as the beach near the Royal Hawaiian was a little less crowded and nicer. The view from the Ritz was fantastic with a water view over the adjacent park. For me, the location not being beachside was not a detractor as we still visited the beach at Waikiki twice and spent another beach day on the North Shore. Just around the corner from the Ritz was all the high end action of Waikiki with fantastic shops and restaurants.The pool was not huge but it was big enough for my family with our 14 and 11 year old to have great fun. Yes, it could be a little crowded at the peak of the afternoon but it was more of a ""fun"" crowded than overcrowded. The quality of the pool with an infinity edge and its two hot tubs was excellent as were the staff at the pool. They have cabanas for rent for a very reasonable cost but we never had an issue finding chairs so we chose not to rent a cabana. Bottom line, we loved the pool and went every day!It looks like the construction of the second tower is nearing completion but it was no issue for us whatsoever. We never heard any construction noise from our room or anywhere else in the hotel with the exception of the spa oddly enough. That said, I had two 50 minute relaxation massages which were very good and there was was no construction noise in the treatment rooms. I do think the completion of the second tower with the big resort pool will be a bonus for the resort.We stayed in a two bedroom suite which was perfect for our family of four. One bedroom had a king and balcony access while the other had a queen bed. My son chose to sleep on the full/queen size sleeper sofa as opposed to sharing his bed with his sister. All the beds were wonderfully comfortably including the sofa sleeper which was insanely comfy for a pull-out bed. They must put a feather pad or something on it. There was a small kitchenette with a almost full size refrigerator and freezer along with a dining table that sat 6. The balcony was large with access from the living room and the master bedroom. Overall, the suite was perfect for a family of 4 or 5. Pristinely modern and clean. Our room was on the 18th floor (1802) and the view of water was sweet!The staff were top notch as you would expect from a Ritz Carlton. The valet staff were numerous and couldn't be more helpful whether it be to help you with your car, your bags, or to provide bags with towels and water for a beach trip. The concierges were always ready to advise you on local activities or set them up for you. Tomo, the front desk manager, and his staff were exceptional. Tomo helped me get some business done during my stay and was a consummate professional. The housekeepers seemed omnipresent yet never intrusive and kept our room pristine. The turndown service every night included preparing the sofa bed without our having to ask after the first night. Overall, the staff rocked.We ate at BLT Market for breakfast and it was wonderful with its open air feel and water view. We didn't get a chance to try Sushi Sho but I hear it is incredible. We did room service one night after a long beach day and it did not disappoint. It arrived quickly and hit the spot. Overall, the Ritz was a big part of our best Hawaiian vacation ever! There is no doubt it is a five star hotel. I would say it ranks in my top two hotels ever along with the new Fairmont Pacific Rim in Vancouver.

If you want a place that can not fail you and cannot go wrong in any way then this is the place. I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel last week and I had an amazing stay. The hotel has a very modern, luxurious and clean look to it and so do the rooms. The view from the room was spectacular as you get the beach and partial sunset views. The room we stayed in had a king size bed which was super comfortable and a sofa bed (which was meh). I really enjoyed all the amenities that it included as it made life so much easier (fridge, coffee maker, washer and dryer). Yes, there was a washer and dryer so I was able to do my laundry before I left for home and not have to carry dirty or stinky beach clothes back home. I don't think I have mentioned that the customer service here is on point; from the moment you are greeted, to the lobby, to bell boy, to housekeeping, to valet, to the pool to the gym and back, they are all smiles and if you need anything, just ask, they will take care of you. Don't forget to ask for your beach bags when going out for a beach day. Also, I must say that I specially appreciate the late afternoon/evening housekeeping check ins. Yup, housekeeping does a second round to see if you need anything else that has come up during the day, like more towels, or maybe your sofa bed needs to be set up? You name it, they got you!",,682cindy,7,5.0

The hotel was gorgeous, clean and the service was top notch. I love the simplistic design of the hotel. It had a very cool, serene, modern Hawaiian vibe.I seriously have not seen such good customer service anywhere else. From the moment we arrived, they treated us with the ultmost hospitality. Our room had a welcome fruit plate which was much appreciated! They also had bumpers on the bed for my children. I loved that they emailed me before my stay to gather more information on my stay. Valet was THE best. They had our car ready with beach bags, towels. chairs, umbrellas and water on all our beach days! They were quick and efficient.The hotel is a short walk to waikiki beach, which we didn't mind. We stayed in a two bedroom suite and it was the perfect amount of space for my family. The view was amazing. Housekeeping was impeccable. We go to Hawaii 1-2 times a year and we usually switch up the hotel to try out new ones, but I will stick to the ritz Carlton from now on!

Some notable call outs - the room service brought us a diaper genie upon requests, gave us a beach umbrella when were heading out, the beach bags is an awesome facility.. with towels and ample water bottles.. the person at the pool was kind enough to offer us a cabana for free when the sun was quite sharp for the baby.... this property scores so high in my list that it has almost set a new standard.

Great security on the property, and very nice and clean. It still feels like a bit of a work in progress in some areas- the pool area is nice, but very small, and can be a wait to get a lounge chair. The spa area feels like office space that has been converted- Im sort of assuming that the final spa will be in the second building that isn't finished yet. Room service is delicious (its from the restaurant near the pool)! The eggs benedict is perfection. But, what makes this a resort to absolutely visit is the staff. I have never experienced such a delightful staff at any property I have ever visited, including the Ritz Carlton on Maui. Attentive, friendly, helpful- just a lovely, lovely group of individuals. A few other tips- the gym may look small, but is great! The machines will allow you to get a solid workout in! ( my husband lifts weights very seriously, as do I, although not as heavy obviously) Dean and Deluca is great for dessert, and some food options- do not miss the lemon tarts (heaven!!), or the uber tarts! Avoid the chicken caesar, and the ahi poke wasn't the best. The veggie lasagna was fabulous! Also, the coffee (espresso) was vile. This is partly personal taste- much of the Honolulu espresso is from a blond, very citrusy blend with a bitter finish. I prefer a cocoa note espresso.All that said- stay there!

Business hotels where guests work late and leave early can error on the side of lower leisure square footage but when guests are coming to enjoy time off they want places to hang out and unfortunately this property is sadly lacking. The pool is postage stamp size and the fact that there are very few lounge chairs makes it even worse. It is so overcrowded that guests sit around the edge of the fireplace waiting for a proper chair. or place on the couch around the fireplace. Their solution? Wait in the pool or your room and we'll call when things open up. In many hotels there would be some green space, gardens or a spacious lobby to wait or enjoy but not here. Once again, they obviously decided that they were not revenue-producing. The staff are friendly and service-oriented, the housekeeping is excellent, the gym is well-equipped and the food is good but these things can't make up for the bad design. The property is not on the beach so they need a better pool as this one had at the minimum 16 crying screaming, splashing kids in it at all times. It was anything but relaxing and there were no rules enforced on the kids. They are opening up a second tower and when they do one pool will be a kids pool and one an adult pool but the new tower will double the occupancy so unless it is 3 times bigger with multiple more lounge chairs it is not going to make this a true luxury property.","Toronto, Canada","Betty-Ann H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",190,2.0

The service itself was fantastic. My wife and mother both received massages and they cannot stop talking about it. I also got a massage. NEGATIVES: None.

In all my world travels, I have never observed and experienced superior performance like that of three Ritz-Carlton pool personnel. The trio of Momo, Mitch, and Devon are in a class by themselves.

There was noise in the daytime because Phase 2 is under construction. Hotel staff kindly let me checked out after staying 1 night and welcome me to go back when construction is finished.

If you can work out when and where it stops, the pink line (orange double decker buses) are ok too.Otherwise, walking directly to the beach from the hotel through the park is quite quick and the beach there (the Royal Moana) is probably nicer anyway.Views from the spacious apartments (we had a two bedroom and its worth it) are amazing.

It is my pleasure to let you know that the staff at Waikiki exceed our expectations and Ritz-Carlton standards......they embodied the theme of ""Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen"" and went beyond that, as they managed to make us feel as though we were family. Justin, the manager went above and beyond when my son forgot his cell phone in our hotel room. We were at the pier getting ready to board our cruise when we called the hotel in a complete panic to see if they could assist us. Laurie at concierge, along with the front desk, and Justin all worked together and managed to get a driver (Mike) to bring the phone to us at the pier; as a result, we were still able to board the Pride of America on time! Maria and Sandy were the first Ladies of the Ritz @ Waikiki to greet us....and they were so warm, friendly, and generous. Maria knew we were a bit dehydrated so she made certain to get us water and fruit (yum!) ; Sandy was so kind to send us chamomile tea, some local adorable memorabilia, and wrote us a beautiful personalized note. Trevor at the front desk did something that we not only did not expect, but we were overwhelmed with gratitude when we realized the amount time and effort he put into doing a very special project for us. Trevor knew that we were going to be visiting his home island, Kauai. He created a personalized colorful portfolio for us which included detailed maps, instructions, and activities based upon our needs. We were so very impressed and so very grateful for this unsolicited help!! Trevor did an amazing job of anticipating our needs. (THANK YOU TREVOR!!) RJ and Chris at the Garage Level also were wonderful and helpful to us. They not only provided us assistance with cabs and luggage, but also made us reservations at The Cheesecake Factory (which normally does not accept reservations) .

Today those vintage hotels are in many cases a throw back to the congestion of an old Miami Beach hotel with tight cramped areas lots of bodies.... the term service is fighting your way to the bar , being served and scrambling to find a spot. The readings on The Ritz were excellent but my agent said "" hey wait they are a residence "" so service will be reduced. Well I had to try and I can tell you that the Ritz Residences at Oahu along with the GM and his staff are exceptional. From checking in; cafe bites; use of concierge ...nothing but the best ... truly excellent and highly successful in providing us a great few days filled with special memories. The views are unparalleled from the 33rd floor you can see all of Diamond Head; and believe me this is the best of the best in Oahu. Now drop a few floors out the elevators and onto street level , turn left and walk 300 feet to the Brand Street of Oahu.

I'm comparing to the big pink Royal Hawaiian and dare I say the Trump Hotel. I'm not focusing on those but will let you know why I think RCR is better. 1. The people and staff!!!- from pulling up the valets were top notch and remembered my name each time even if we were just walking through. Kudos to Ryan my favorite. But everyone will make you feel appreciated and will go out of their way to make you happy. 2. The Location- this hotel is located right across from the park with a flawless view to the ocean. Even though you're not on the beach you are only a block away and if you're like us this is just the first Island before on a many more to come so if this is your shopping stop you have hit the mother load and can do the beach on your next stops. Also great jump off to the highway for great site seeing and North Sea visits. But all and all located on tip of Kalakaua Ave (main drag) so you can throw yourself into the crazy tourist scene or not. 3. The Room- we had a deluxe ocean front studio on a middle level and it was perfect. The room was more than comfortable it was spacious and well pointed. The two highlights are the extremely quiet washer and dryer and the TOTO toilet....you need to go to Japan or go to the RCR and experience the thrill of the TOTO!!I can't comment on any restaurants since we ate out all four nights nor can I comment on the pool but it looked beautiful but I don't think you will regret staying here and will truly enjoy your stay!,,DClive2trvl,2,5.0

My family enjoyed our two bedroom ocean-view suite at this beautiful luxury hotel. The room was perfect, excellent color choices and material palette. The rooms always smelled great, the housekeeping came by twice a day. Anything we wanted would be delivered: extra pots or pans, nail clippers, etc. It was such a lovely room we did not want to leave. The beds were like clouds and we all slept so well every night. The only negative we had was that the showers had no doors and water often got out of the shower area. There were also no shelves for the showering necessities like shampoo and conditioner, and we had to bend down multiple times per shower to use all of that. But that's minor.The construction noises were a problem only on some mornings, but that cannot be avoided and the hotel staff took care of us.What really made this trip perfect and this stay at Ritz was the hotel staff. We enjoyed the company of our family from Hawaii, the Ritz staff. They made sure we had everything we needed and helped celebrate a birthday as well as an achievement. When we left the underwater camera in one of the towel bags, it was delivered to us poolside when we had completely forgotten about it! That's what you call service. Noteworthy people, we want to thank: Cocoh, RJ, Josh, Maria, and the housekeeping as well as everyone at the valet and concierge.

Unfortunately, it does not participate in the Marriott, the Ritz Carlton, and the SPG rewards programs. There are three restaurants on site. We ate breakfast at the BLT Market. The menu was a bit boring so we decided not to go back. The second restaurant is actually a branch of Dean & DeLuca. That was a pleasant surprise for me. We had a late brunch at the market and the sandwiches were very good. Dean & DeLuca has wine and cheese in the afternoons. It's a little like a tapas bar, I am guessing. The top floor where the bar is has a wide selection of charcuteries. We weren't able to try it.The third restaurant is Sushi Sho by Tokyo's famed Chef Nakazawa. For $300 per person, you can be one of the lucky ten diners. That was a bit out of our price range so we opted to eat elsewhere. We were told that the place is always fully booked for weeks.",USA,"WanderingAmerican</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>USA</strong>",124,5.0

My 2nd favorite hotel so far is the W HOTEL - Maldives.David Nakamura - is a God send and an exceptional concierge staff member! He proactively anticipated and handled all my needs - from scheduling a private car service for my elderly mother who came in hours after my arrival, arranged wheelchair access for her at the airport (arrival and departure - which i never thought of to ask), bought us beach chairs and umbrellas for the beach (which we left at the hotel for other guests to enjoy), made sure our room was high enough and away from any dust from the construction, given my mother's lung tumor diagnosis, and even took time to research where to buy a specific item my mother wanted purchased from Hawaii. Of course there were other staff members that deserve my praise and gratitude - upon arrival my american ATM card was deactivated (without my knowledge) and i was stuck for 4 days without access to cash to tip the staff for their service. Never once did their exceptional level of service falter, or was it any less than what i would expect had i tipped them well. The staff was very helpful with recommending which restaurants and shows to see, which supermarkets to buy reasonably priced groceries during our stay, and where to go shopping.ACCOMMODATIONS:The room was well designed, gorgeous, clean and spacious. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and felt like a cloud - not too soft, but perfect enough for me after a long flight from HK. It came with a washer and dryer, nespresso coffeemaker and a proper kitchen to cook from if you're traveling with kids or elderly parents who may have restrictive diets. The Smart TV's in the suite, made it easy to log into our HULU, NETFLIX and PANDORA accounts - thank you for that! Oh and did i mention that their is free, high quality WiFi service through out the hotel, without the need to log-in ever- which can be so annoying.BEACH ACCESS:The Hotel is about 5 mins away from the beautiful Waikiki beach, exactly 4 streets away - and a very easy walk. My mother is 70 yrs old with bad knees, and the walk wasn't any hassle at all for her. At the beach you can easily find activities to do and places to eat. You can rent 2 beach chairs with umbrella for $25/hr. NOTE: All the vendors can be found directly in front of the entrance to the beach, which is a straight line from the hotel. SHOPPING & RESTAURANTS:The hotel is situated at the beginning of the main street where you will find all the best shops and restaurants to visit - KALAKAUA Ave. This avenue is about 2 miles long and the perfect place to sight-see and find things to do during the evening hours.POOLThe hotel pool is medium sized and gets sun after 12 noon, however it never gets too full, and you can always find a chair and umbrella. There's always a constant supply of fresh towels, flavored water and free fruit to snack on when lounging. The pool staff is very pleasant and attentive, and the hotel's restaurant offers delicious and healthy dishes.Overall i love this hotel and their staff !! I look forward to visiting Hawaii again, and staying ONLY at this hotel. If i had the money, i would buy one of their hotel suites, as their staff and attention to service is exceptional.

What really stood out at this property were the staff. From the moment we checked in until the moment we checked out staff were attentive, discrete, thorough, and most of all they just genuinely seem to really enjoy providing the service that they did. My Fiancée and I are admittedly picky when we travel and it is rare that something doesn't meet with at least a less than favourable comment from one of us - I actually remarked to her upon our departure that this was probably the first time I had stayed at any hotel where EVERYTHING met my expectations.This was thrown into stark contrast when we visited the Four Seasons in Ko'Olina, one of the island's other ""premiere"" properties later in the week. As this is a review of the Ritz I won't elaborate on the Four Seasons here other than to say the difference in the care of the staff was glaring.The Ritz Waikiki was clean, amenities were great, and in some ways it was nice to be away from the beach - the pool on the (7th?) floor provided a decent view and was staffed well and only moderately busy at most during our stay. All in all I would highly recommend this property and especially its service.","Vancouver, British Columbia","riskreward2017</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, British Columbia</strong>",4,5.0

The first thing we did notice was how filthy the pale green carpet was outside the elevator. The room didn't stun on first glance, it was fresh and bright and in a similiar soft green palate to the rest of the hotel.It was also very compact made to look even more so by the kitchen/washer/dryer that ran along the wall, which resembled a flat pack installation from Ikea. After a long flight that arrived in the am and a check in that wasn't till 4pm. I wanted a leisurely soak in the bath. The bath tub was a compact Japanese soaker which you sit in. Despite a step I needed a pole vault to get in. My husband anxiously stressed to take care getting out but unfortunately I slipped trying to swivel out and not being able to touch the floor landed on the tiles.There was no way I was going to spend 7 days enduring that and Olivia at reception very promptly found another room and kindly upgraded us to a normal bath. We also got about 15 extra sq metres which certainly enhanced our stay. We loved our room and the view but the hotel itself didn't knock our socks off. So much opportunity to do something amazing when so few new hotels are actually built in Waikiki and the Ritz just didn't do it. The staff however were amazing, helpful, eager to please and personable.We had two amazing facials in the spa and the pool area while compact does boast Honolulu's highest infinity pool. The gym area is fabulous with some of the best equipment we've used in a hotel in a while. It was just a shame that one guest thought it was acceptable to sweat profusely over equipment, windows and the floor. We couldn't use equipment within a metre radius of him without getting sweat flicked on us. Perhaps instructions and sanitiser should be installed to advise guests of proper gym etiquette.The bedding was also a little bizarre, rather than a normal mattress topper we had a donna under our sheet. We discovered this after running hot all night, housekeeping removed it for us the next day. However the bottom sheet isn't big enough to tuck into the mattress, meaning it balls up and moves during the night.We were also disappointed with the choice of food. There was the BLT market that did one of the worst Chicken Club Sandwiches I have eaten in a while. Not only didn't it resemble a Club Sandwich it didn't even make it as a passable chicken sandwich. Breakfasts were OK but limited A la Carte choices mean't we went elsewhere for breakfast. Try Bill's for great scrambled eggs.If you are looking for a new property in Hawaii that boasts a perfect location and amazing view then this is the one for you. Unlike the old and dated Marriotts and Hyatts everything is new and modern and not circa 1970's.Although if you want something really quirky and fun check out the new Laylow a brand new boutique hotel on Kuhio Ave thats just opened.

It's a smaller property, so the staff became very familiar with us, and are super friendly.What I loved: The size of the rooms, the layout were really nice. We stayed in a 1 bedroom, and it was perfect for our family of 3. Plenty of space, and the room felt very clean, bed was comfortable. We did not cook at all, but it was handy having a full-sized fridge, and microwave if we wanted to heat something up. Also great having a washing machine/dryer. We did a load toward the end of our stay so we didn't pack a suitcase full of dirty clothes going home. Housekeeping always came when we requested, and refilled waters for us. The restaurant is great. Not amazing, but solid service, and good food. Standouts are the garlic fries, the complimentary Brazilian cheese bread (gluten-free), and the poke. My husband really enjoyed their club sandwich by the pool. I loved their options for kids--they had beyond the ""chicken tenders"" and ""grilled-cheese"" and actually offered balanced meal options for the little ones. My daughter also brought home a few stuffed animals offered by the amazing valet/bellman staff. We were always able to find seating by the pool. It's not huge, but had 2 hot tubs and was clean. The service by the pool was great too. The location of the hotel is slightly nestled off the end of the strip where it starts to become less busy. The only reason why I think we would stay somewhere else next time, is that this hotel lacked the ""resort feel"" which, looking back in hindsight, was to be expected. I didn't realize that this building were mostly condos (even though the ""residences"" in the name should have given that away). We missed the ability to choose from multiple restaurants, a breakfast buffet (although I later learned this isn't big in Oahu anyway), happy hour, entertainment, a social area where people gathered each evening, etc. It was slightly sleepier than we wanted. It makes sense since it's residential, so if you know this and are okay with it, you will love the experience here. It lives up to the Ritz standard in every aspect.","San Francisco, California","ellenphant</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",44,4.0

Both myself and two friends stayed in a Deluxe Ocean View Studio Room for six nights and we did not ever want to go home. The staff at Ritz-Carlton Waikīkī Beach are what made our stay so special. Our Guest Relations Agent Tomoko Miura was simply amazing, she emailed me in the weeks before our stay to confirm if we needed transport, activities or groceries booked and made sure that our card authorisation was processed without issue. Tomoko was able to upgrade us to a Deluxe Studio Room free of charge which was a lovely birthday gift. She even made sure that a birthday card and beautiful complimentary fruit platter were left in the fridge the occasion!The concierges Laurie and Jamie were always bubbly meeting us with a big smile and a hug. They were so helpful booking six full days of activities and making us a very clear itinerary so we wouldn't get confused. We also found that the concierge Jordan was very helpful and even personally brought an itinerary up to the room one night when I had lost the original, accompanied by a map he had drawn on how to reach the pickup spot and recommendation on when we needed to depart the next day. Our concierge Laurie went so far as to send a birthday card and some sparkling wine up to our room free of charge for my birthday. You CANNOT find better service than this!Even our valet Ryan was exceptional, he made sure to ask how our activities went every day, helped us find our way around Waikīkī and brought a range of hot teas to our room when one of our party was sick. The standard of cleanliness in this hotel is impeccable, our room was serviced TWICE a day and housekeeping took note that we preferred our water room temperature so made sure to leave it out of the fridge. The view from the balcony was outstanding, whilst this is not a beach front hotel you can clearly see the ocean from your room. The hotel is so close to the main strip that as three ladies we felt very safe to venture out until midnight, as the hotel was always within safe distance of shops, bars and restaurants all open until 11pm. I hope that nothing about RCRWB changes because it is simply perfect. My friends and I all agree that we will never stay anywhere else in Waikīkī again, not even the Halekulani, as the service just does not compare.

The first time we were in Waikiki for one week before our sons wedding to a Japanese lady on the Island of Maui. Her parents were coming from Japan and her father had never flown on an airplane before and had never been out of the country. We were coming from the east coast and knew that Hawaii was a very Japanese friendly place and a good mid-point for all of us to meet. We also knew that some of the fine dining restaurants had at least one Japanese speaking waiter on staff. Although they did not speak English, and we did not speak Japanese, we all had such wonderful experiences together that we decided to vacation together again. We received notice that the Ritz Carlton Residences had opened in September and was offering a wonderful promotional discount deal. We decided to take advantage of the offer. Since the three bedroom apartments were all taken, we settled for the one bedroom luxury suite for each of us. Each suite had a balcony that faced the Pacific Ocean, a living room with TV, a bedroom with a king bed and TV, a kitchenette will two burner induction coil stove, regular oven, microwave oven, refrigerator/freezer, silverware, glasses, pots/ pans and dishes, utensils, washer and dryer, and a very big bathroom with a double sink. The bathroom entrance was wide and large enough to accommodate anyone in a wheel chair with a large roll-in shower and a tub, but there were no grab bars for handicap/disable person. The toilet area was separated from the rest of the bathroom by a large frosted glass door and was large enough to fit someone in a wheelchair. The entire bathroom area was separated from the rest of the suite by a large sliding door. We took advantage of the fact that we had a refrigerator and stove and went to the store and bought food for a hardy breakfast and lunch each day. At nights we went out to very nice restaurants for dinner and entertainment. We also took advantage of the washer and dryer, so that we did not have to bring too many changes of clothes.I was told that each apartment in the hotel is privately owned and the Ritz Carlton manages and rents the apartments when the owners are not using them. The one bedroom suite we were using was approximately 570 sqft and very comfortable. Our son and his wife had arrived a few days before we did and had informed the hotel attendants that we were coming. When we arrived we were very warmly greeted like celebrities by a group of attendants on the ground floor and given an Hawaiian necklace. They unloaded our bags and escorted us up the lobby on the sixth floor. The valet parked the car. After we checked-in we were given a welcome Hawaiian fruit drink by one of the waiters from the BLT Restaurant in from of the lobby registration desk. When we arrived at our room our luggage was placed in our room, then the attendant gave us a tour and explained how each piece of equipment worked in the apartment. From the balcony we could see very clearly the Pacific Ocean, but we were not on the beach. We were approximately a block and a half from the beach. The sunsets and the views from the balcony were absolutely terrific. Directly below the balcony was the infinity pool with a constant water temperature of 81 degrees. We could also see Kalakaua Avenue where all of the high end trendy stores are located. At the pool the two attendants on duty MoMo and Killian were very attentive and helpful. They brought us towels for the chaise lounge and the head rest and brought us a lemon water drink. There were fresh apples at the side of the pool and they offer us some apples. In addition to the main pool, there was a separate smaller kiddy pool at one end of the pool and a hot tub with lounging area to hangout at the other end. In the gym the equipment was well maintained and there were towels, head phones, water and apples. There were no trainers in the gym, but I saw separate rooms for Yoga and other types of exercise activities. The staff and attendants at this hotel are all young, friendly, energetic and really eager to serve you in anyway they can without expecting any tips or gratuities for their services. The people that came to clean the rooms in the mornings and evenings were also very friendly and eager to serve and address any of our needs, and they all appeared to be foreigners.Our experiences at this hotel were wonderful. We asked to see several three bedroom apartments on the higher floors and they were absolutely gorgeous. Since the Ritz Carlton is currently building a second tower right next to the current tower, we will return for another family visit. The apartments in the new tower will also be privately owned. If you stay at this hotel, you will have experiences that you will never forget, because they will all be good.","Stamford, Connecticut","travelace71</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stamford, Connecticut</strong>",36,5.0

The RC residences are in a fantastic location. I had the larger of the 1 bedroom configurations. The lobby is on the 7th floor. The reception area is small but functional. The pool is adjacent to the lobby and restaurants and has room for about 20 loungers in a narrow space. It felt forced, but I'm sure this will change when the second tower opens.The residence was brand new and very well equipped. I felt the bedroom could have used a small table other than the small nightstands to leave your pocket stuff at the end of the day.My bathroom had a 5 foot open wet room adjacent to the bathtub. I did not enjoy staring myself in the mirror while showering and having someone walk by to use the loo while showering is not my idea of luxury. In addition, there is a hand held shower head, but with no barriers in the shower, how do you use it without a flood? There was also no shelf for soap, etc. The narrow ledge around the bathtub is inappropriate for messy soap.The toilets are the japanese heat and clean your underside type, nice but dirty fingers pushing the ""wash me"" buttons is unappealing to this traveler.All else was excellent, including the service, staff, housekeeping, etc.I enjoyed my stay, but wouldn't come back until the facilities were expanded and the construction complete.","New York City, New York","Seven_Continents</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",73,4.0

While, in Ritzcarlton, the cleaning service was quite earlier than before (usuaully around 9 a.m.), and their turn down service was always on time so that we could feel the coziness all the time. (They put little chocolates on the bed all the time!)They provided beach bags when we went out, and they have some place where we could check our e-mail and print out the documents. Unlike Trump, they did mailing services international ( Not Fedex- Trump told us they could only do Fedex services, not for other international mailing services).In the room, there were washing machine and dry machine, so it was very convenient to family traveller like us. There is Dean and Deluca on the first floor, and in the swimming place, there were two jacuzzi, so it was good to relax and watch the sunset while swimming!

But first, let's talk about this hotel, our first stop after an awful Jetstar flight that was thoroughly forgettable and a reminder of why we rarely fly with them! Sadly, we were too late for the Qantas flight ...We arrived in Honolulu tired and grumpy and stiff; despite this, we were immediately charmed and delighted by the staff at this hotel (and that's despite the fact that we didn't get our room until late in the afternoon!). We loved Waikiki, and we loved this hotel. It is new and modern and sparkling clean, but what made it exceptional were the beautiful, friendly, ever-cheerful, forever- helpful staff, for whom precious little was too much trouble (if it was within their power). From the person who greeted you on arrival with those delicious floral leis to the young woman by the pool and from the reception staff to the super-knowledgable staff at the concierge desk, the staff were first class. They were friendly and helpful, without feeling fake or disingenuous (which some hotel staff can't quite pull off). Special mention to David at the Concierge Desk, who was absolutely wonderful and to the very stylish and beautifully groomed man who seemed to be ubiquitous, anticipating your every need before you even knew you had it yourself; seriously. I think he was in charge of the concierge staff and he was exceptional.Our apartment was very spacious and nicely furnished, and we really appreciated having access to Netflix on the TVs (there were 3 in our 3 bedroom apartment). The views of the ocean were wonderful (and will only improve when the second tower is completed - we looked over the construction site from our room which was a bit ugly but no drama and we weren't at all affected by any noise issues). If I had to make helpful suggestions, I would say the apartment could be better appointed in terms of an electric jug or kettle for boiling water (rather than relying on the hot plate), fresh milk in the fridge, some mugs for tea and coffee (rather than just cups) and a lighter blanket for the beds (in addition to the beautiful comforters) for people who prefer less warm bed covers. The other thing that was a bit perplexing were the lounge chairs without arms (meant you couldn't really ""lounge"" on them!) in the living room (but the sofa was big and nice). Some extra cushions would also be great. Having said that, the beds were super comfy (as good as the Heavenly beds at the Westin!) and it was great having a washer and dryer; we really did love this place.","Sydney, Australia","FamilyinChina</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",59,5.0

Would have been better still if the pool was a little larger so you could do laps and if it was on the beach - but everything is a trade off.

On the last night 5 staff members were having their own little chat/joke on the ground floor desk and didn't even acknowledge us as we walked in. Ryan was one person who was consistently warm & helpful and also the poolside team. The room was quiet and the bed was divine. The wardrobe was not adequate for a 9 night stay. The only chest of 3 drawers was inside it with the safe on top of the drawers so there wasn't enough space to even hang a shirt without the bottom getting crumpled. The small amount of full length space was shared with the ironing board so most of our clothes were accessed out of suitcases - annoying and disappointing for a 5 star hotel.The shower was fine but a word of warning about the tub - even with the step provided, I found it challenging to get in/out of and I'm pretty strong and flexible (see pic).I loved the kitchenette which was well equipped and gave us the freedom to make our own breakfast and snacks. Housekeeping staff didn't always clean the room thoroughly so a dustpan and brush for crumbs etc. would have been helpful. The housekeeping didn't live up to 5 star service, my soap dish wasn't cleaned once in 9 days, some days we had to ask for more shower gel but there would be 3 or 4 shampoos there. Wifi is included in the room price. I liked the phone chargers and that we could access Netflix on the large TV. The hotel is well situated for shopping.

The staff - all of the staff - are Exceptional!I cannot put into words the amazing service we received at this Hotel.Every single staff member we interacted with was so friendly and welcoming. From the greeting we received when we first arrived in the entrance and being escorted to the reception on the Lobby level. We were presented with traditional leis on our arrival as well as bottled waterIn the lobby we were given welcome drinks with the option to add dark rum if we felt inclined - which we did. Our room was a studio room on the 9th floor. Our view wasn't the best you could get in this property as we were rather low but we could see the ocean over Fort De Russey Park. We had a lounge area and a nice, very very very comfortable King bed. The bathroom was large with a great shower, double basins and a small bath. The TV was a smart TV with a huge range of channels and you could even log in with your own Netflix account and watch it on the TV. The kitchenette had a sink and a Nespresso machine and other appliances like toaster and microwave, plates, glasses and utensilsThe only negatives about our room were that lack of anywhere to put your suitcases so we had to leave them on the floor in the lounge area and as we were on a lower floor right outside our balcony were 2 large air-conditioning fans from the building next door that when they were on the noise meant we couldn't go out on the balcony. This was pretty much all day and into the evening.The pool area was great. probably not quite big enough for the size of the property but adequate. Jordan and Robyn looked after us really well with towels and water while we relaxed by the pool and the restaurant staff kept us supplied with food and more alcoholic drinks when required.The Hotel restaurant, BLT Market was excellent with a very good menu. We had the please of meeting Amanda who was the General Manager of BLT Market and we enjoyed several very good meals there. Her hospitality was just so genuine and she was always making sure we were being looked after or enjoying ourselves. Michele in the restaurant was also just outstanding along with all of the wait staff that were there. All of them always made sure we were happy.From 3-5 each day they had happy hour at the bar with a selection of reduced price drinks and Drew and Melana ( I think it was Melana) were great at making Mai Tai's.On several mornings I would go for a run out to Diamond Head and back and every time I arrived back they were ready with a bottle of cold water for me. The gym is THE BEST I have seen in a Hotel. All the weights you need, running machines and even a punch/kick bag plus battle ropes.The day after we arrive a Dean and Deluca opened up at the entrance to the hotel and we had the pleasure of meeting Karrina who was an absolute star.The hotel is a little way from the beach but it is an easy 10 minute walk (only because you have to wait at 2 sets of lights) to the beach. There you can hire surf boards, loungers and umbrella's. The Hotel even give you beach bags that include towels and water.Would I stay here again?
