Great price for Tokoyo for new modern hotel. Just 20 mins walk west of the main Shinjuku train station or just 2 stops on the Odieo line E27 to E29 . Use the stop numbers is the best way !We popped up at the A2 exit at Nishishinjukku and bang there was the hotel . 1 minute walk.The was small but very practical and all the necessary room facilities. No problem for the two of us. Very comfortable and quiet. Very clean.The Irish pub downstairs offers a fantastic full breakfast . The best value breakfast I can remember in a long time.

I read the other reviews and expected the rooms to be small, but nothing could prepare me for what I got! This was nothing less than bait-and-switch since the photos on their site are NOTHING like the actual rooms.First of all, the hotel is filled with millennials and thanks to the paper-thin walls, you have the pleasure of hearing them yell in the hallways and come into their rooms, slamming doors, drunk at all hours thanks to the ""pub"" on the first floor. This made me feel like I was staying in a youth hostel or frat house. When I first got into my room, I realized nothing was plugged in (an effort to save on the cost of electricity). This was my first clue that when it comes to saving a penny, this hotel will do it! After plugging in my temperature control, I turned up the thermostat to warm the freezing cold room but little happened. I went to the desk and asked if my heater was broken. I was then told that all of the rooms in the hotel are kept at the same temperature controlled at the front desk! You can not change the temperature of your own room! It's cold during the day (the bathroom has no heat at all and a direct vent to the outside which makes it downright freezing) and it's HOT at night. I actually slept with the window open in January in order to sleep - however, then you get to put up with the street noise. Also, everything you've turned on, including your air purifying system will turn off as soon as you remove your key and leave your room, so each time you enter the room, you have to turn everything on again.The room itself is tiny and the bathroom is minuscule! There are no dressers or drawers of any kind - and the ""closet"" consists of two pegs hanging on the wall with four broken hangers on them. There is an ""ice engine"" only on the 2nd floor, but no ice bucket in the room. The bed was so old it literally slanted on one side so badly I had to sleep against the wall to prevent falling out during the night and the pillows are 2 inches thick and hard as rocks. They offer ""English breakfast"" for 15,000 yen IF you pay in advance - if you don't it's more expensive. Their idea of English breakfast is a hot dog bar and chicken nuggets. They also offer scrambled eggs the consistency of thin soup.Perhaps the worst part of the experience was the ""housekeeping"". There were short, black hairs on my pillow when I checked in. I shook off the pillow and used the other one assuming they would be changed in the morning. The following day I noticed that none of the bedding was changed. That night I purposely left a small lipstick stain on one of the pillows to see if it would get changed the next day. The next day after housekeeping finished my room, I looked at the pillow. They actually turned the pillowcase inside out and reused it! The final insult came when I asked the front desk to call a taxi for the following morning and was told they had already used up their quota of taxi calls and refused to call one! Four days later on the final morning, I asked again for the desk to call a cab and was told there would be a 5000 yen charge to make the call. I ended up hailing a cab from the street.The bottom line is this hotel is a reasonable price for Tokyo, but you get bargain basement treatment, service, accommodations and you'll get nickeled and dimed at every turn. Truly the worst hotel I have ever stayed in anywhere.","Phoenix, Arizona","Von P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",32,1.0

After 2 weeks of traveling in Japan, and this was the worst!!!! 1. The hotel is not in a central place. There are much better neighborhoods to be in while in Tokyo. There is a metro station near the hotel, but you are better off staying at a central location.2. The real problem of this hotel is the staff. If I could grade a 0... I would! Staff at the reception that could not care less. The give you a feeling you are bothering them. They are so helpless and with no motivation. A few examples:*We arrived at the hotel and asked if our suitcases arrived. We sent them a few days before. The receptionist said no. We asked him to please check. He said he knows and it did not arrive. After 10 minutes he went to check and found them. We almost had a heart attack. *we entered the room and saw the pillows were like a piece of cardboard. We asked for another pillow. The answer we got was unbelievable: put a towel on your pillow.*we asked to reserve a cab for the next morning. The answer we got was: we can't. Why? Because they work with one station and they are out of cabs. The solution, go out and find a cab on your own* Whenever I asked for the manager, they gave a few versions: there is no manager for the next few days, or... every receptionist is the manager. I have a few names, and they all were managers even though it was clear they certainly were not.Conclusion: the human resource which is supposed to give you a good welcomed feeling does exactly the opposite here. They give you a bad feeling, a very unwelcomed feeling, and if you add this to the unattractive location, you understand that this is not a recommended hotel. I think it is a shame no one really manages this hotel, and that the service is unacceptable. When you pay... you expect... and this hotel does not deliver. Very disappointed.

I initially made the mistake of focusing only on hotels immediately next to or located to the east side of Shinjuku where are the actions are. This particular APA hotel is slightly out of the way & on the quieter side (west) of Shinjuku, 2 stops away on the Oedo line. Location was still great, the subway stop (exit 2) is literally right across from the hotel. Exit 1 is prob 200 feet further away but it has elevator for those with heavy dunnage, also it’s on the same side of the street as the hotel.Room was very small as expected, no where to put my suitcase. The bathroom was tiny, small basin with minimal cupboard space. They have a single complicated system that uses levers, knobs & dials to control the water for both the shower as well as the basin. One wrong move and the shower might be spraying hot water in your face when you are expecting cool water gently coming out of the basin faucet. This was consistent with other APA hotels in the area. I only used the shower once, the temp & pressures were very good. Mostly I took advantage of the in-house Onsen facilities, going twice daily to soak & relax. The bed was firm, pillows were firm, if you are a back sleeper who usually keep your head straight up you will be fine. The moment you tilt your head slightly to either side you will notice the lack of support that you would expect from a regular fluffy pillow. In terms of amenities I liked the mini fridge, hairdryer a new set of Japanese bathrobe each day for the spa. On the other hand none of the APA hotels have safety boxes in the room. The Onsen spa was quite nice, theirs is a bit more spacious than the other APA which I will review later. Indoor as well as outdoor open air pools are available. I prefer the latter as I like fresh cool air while getting cooked. There are also 2 large earthenware tubs (shawagara?) outside for individual bathers, note that the temperature in those tubs are much higher so ease yourself in gently. The pools here are more spacious than the other APA I stayed at & the whole facility is very nice. No tattooed bathers are allowed, but 1 nite I saw 3 guys with extensive tats on their arms & backs came in. They were mean looking & were probably yakuza members. Two of them were even making loud yelling noises as if other guests did not even existed. Not sure if the hotel staff ever checked. Tried their BF buffet once just to see and it was ok. Selection was limited compared to the bigger hotels. Coffee was very good even though it was dispensed from an ancient coffee maker & cheap self-pouring pot. I am used to nice hotels with fancy coffee makers & dispensers. Other than BF I never tried the Irish pub. They don’t show any American sports, I asked but unfortunately no NFL games. Nearby several convenience stores, McDonalds 5 min walk away. There were some good looking restaurants in the area but I did not try. On the other hand I enjoyed eating a few times in 24-hr casual diner (Matsuya), good & cheap. Hotel Staff overall were efficient & helpful, adequate English skills. Note they charge you 420 JPY to help you get taxi service. After staying in other hotels in the area I have come to appreciate this place a bit more for its quiet & convenient location, as well as good quality spa facilities. It was also better value than other comparable hotels, perhaps on the map it has the illusion of being further away than it actually is. I would def consider staying here again.","Fremont, California","bosoxpride101</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fremont, California</strong>",3,4.0

The facility is kept very clean and cool with the hot weather. Most of the staff speak English. We arrived many hours before the 1500 (3 pm) check in and we were able to store our luggage in the lobby until it was check in time. This enabled us to walk around the hotel and its vicinity.Staff:All employees at this facility were excellent. From the front desk to housekeeping. Very professional and informative. Room:The size of the room is small. Yes, however, you are not coming to Japan to stay in a room and order room service. If you want that, please go to the larger hotels (Hilton, Hyatt, etc.) for those amenities. Our room was set at 18°C every night and we never had any issues with the air conditioning. Also, with the severe humidity, there is a dehumidifier in each room to help with that. There are no closets so all luggages are to be pushed under the bed. There are plenty of AC plugs for all of your electronics as well as 1 dedicated area for a USB plug. Don't forget your travel convertors. Each room has a small water boiler, coffee, creamer, sugar, and green tea. Room/public bath robes are also provided and changed daily. There is a small refrigerator under the desk. There is a nice big tv in every room. The Wi-Fi in the room and the main lobby is very quick.Bed:We got a double room. Just to caveat this, I am 5'8"" and my husband is 6'3"" athletic build. The bed was just right for us, but since I'm used to a king size, I felt it was a bit tight. Mattress was comfortable. The pillows were soft, but if you like thick fluffy pillows, I suggest bringing your own to supplement the hotels.Bathroom:Leave your shampoo, conditioner, and body wash at home...unless you only use certain ones. They have large bottles of each so there won't be any chance you'll run out. Also, every room has a razor, toothbrush/toothpaste, shower cap, hair tie, q-tip, body scrubber, and travel comb/brush. Towels are changed daily. What I love about Japan are the bidets. The only thing missing is the dryer part of the bidet but if you've never tried it, now is your chance. Pool/Public Bath:I cannot comment on the pool since I did not see it. The hotel offers a public bath for men and women separately. Each public bath has an indoor and an outdoor section. For many travelers who walked as much as my husband and I did, the public bath was a wonderful way to relax. Due to it being separate, it was hard to sit alone in the public bath without having anyone to talk to. Please be respectful to all the hotel patrons as this is a naked public bath. Wash your hair and body with shampoo and soap before entering. The female ""locker room"" is equipped with hair dryers, face wash, face softener, and lotion for post public bath needs.Laundry:Again, September is hot and humid which means your clothes will be damp from the sweat. Laundry is available for use. In 10 nights, we did laundry twice. What a difference that makes. 500¥ for the wash and 100¥ for 30 min dry. Restaurant:We did not purchase the breakfast option but we did eat at the restaurant that is connected to the lobby. Irish Pub themed with good food. The steak and fries was a good size and a good deal. I definitely wouldn't mind having that steak as I write this review.Location:The hotel is literally a 1 minute walk from the Toei Ōedo Subway line. E29 Nishi-shinjuku-gochome is the stop. If you need to go to Shinjuku station, you can take the subway or you can walk about 10-15 minutes and you can get to the west entrance of Shinjuku station where the JR train is. There are quite a few places to eat around this hotel, but if you want to be in the center of everything, this place me be too quiet. There is a Lawson and FamilyMart within walking distance as well. Overall:Great location. Great price. Great facility. Definitely will come back.","Anaheim, California","Z6069BAhannahc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anaheim, California</strong>",2,5.0

Especially within these parameters, it well-served my needs in Tokyo, as a rather new hotel with a decent (if small) room and very close proximity to a subway station. The hotel does not have a concierge, which is no big deal, but I found the front desk clerks only blandly efficient. No particularly friendliness and few spoke much English, unable to recommend any restaurants or give guidance about getting to Mount Fuji. Of course, I don't speak any Japanese, so I don't mean this to be highly critical, just advisory. A bit interestingly, the hotel's restaurant is an Irish Pub, which made for decent late night snacking, but I didn't feel the amount charged for the breakfast buffet was worth my partaking. And I thought charging 1000 Yen (roughly $10 USD) to use the swimming pool for an hour was pretty chintzy, especially as I had prepaid for 8 nights at the hotel.

Vending machines within hotel include soft drink and alcohol. The bar downstairs offers meals too and has a pool table. The coin operated laundry needs a few more washers and dryers as there are only 2 of each to service all of the guests.

Prior to checking in I missed my flight for the prior day and it was booked when I arrived at the hotel and told them they did not refund me for the day missed due to circumstances not of my own nor did they offer to upgrade my room. NO ONE IN THIS HOTEL SPEAKS ANY ENGLISH, so it was nearly impossible to communicate with anyone. ( in Vegas a large percentage of our hotel employees are bilingual and if they are not they go out of their way to find a translator not ignore your questions or request as they did in this hotel) they do not accommodate people with tattoos in their onsens which is understandable but quite a bummer because they have so many younger people in and out of this hotel. There is no gym facilities. There is a restaurant located downstairs that is attached to the hotel not sure if it’s owned by the hotel but horrible service. Every time I ate there whatever I wanted was sold out or not available a good 80% of the time it was closed. If I asked for utensils or condiments I was told no. I was pushed out of my room with a phone call from the lobby telling me they needed to change my sheets after I clearly had a do not disturb sign on the door when I told them politely please come after 3 they told me no it was too late and that why would come at 2( why would you change my sheets the day before I check out? I’ve been here 2 weeks and haven’t had an issue with them changing the sheets because they only changed them once prior because I took off the sheets MYSELF, I found this extremely inconsiderate to the fact that My needs need to be met as I am a paying customer yet it was the opposite.I guess my expectations were high for this hotel because it was beautiful when I walked in the lobby but I was sadly mistaken. I will not ever return or book with this company nor its sister companies. I wish they would have made the experience in this hotel a better one.",,Alyssa J,1,2.0

I've stayed in many hotels in Japan and this one is by far the smallest. This room should not be classed as double room - it should only have one single bed in it. There were many problems with our stay. Firstly, the base of the bed was too small for the mattress which meant the bed had a lean on it. The pillows were like rocks. When my partner went to the toilet he had to leave the door open because his legs didn't fit inside the toilet area. We had to pay extra money to access the hotel's pool etc . We were on a non-smoking floor, yet the place stunk of smoke. The breakfast on offer downstairs was average. After our two nights stay all we could do was laugh and learn by our mistakes.

In my view, we could have checked in within less than a minute if we simply did it one-to-one with a person, however we were made to use these machines which made everything more difficult and took almost 10 minutes to navigate.Once in the room however, all was forgiven. It is a business-style hotel so the rooms are small and there are no frills or luxuries, but it is very comfortable. In particular, I enjoyed the huge size of the TV! If you get an upper floor room the views of Shinjuku are spectacular!You are in walking distance of many restaurants and bars, and even the centre of Shinjuku is not too far away. We didn't try to breakfast on site but instead went for a coffee on the corner (Counterpart Coffee Gallery) - my advise is to avoid this coffee shop as it takes literally 20 minutes to make you a very mediocre coffee... But back to the hotel, I will definitely be staying here again as it was a comfortable and affordable stay, in a brilliant location (especially when comparing to more luxury hotels such as the Hilton or the Park Hyatt, I would definitely opt instead for the simplicity and affordability of APA).","London, United Kingdom","robertsilver77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",5,4.0

Use exit 1 and in not even 5 minutes walk you reach the hotel. The same metro station is a good point to reach other locations, but some require a change of line, eg if you want to go to Shibuya.

Fantastic.The hotel is very nice, elegant and has all services you need: wifi free, laundry, SPAs, pools, you name it.Rooms are small, but had the essential. The bed was big, lights everywhere, massive tv screen with hotel information, bathroom with the typical Japanese toilet-bide with buttons. Very cool for one person.Rooms were clean and you could request eco-cleaning, meaning cleaners would only clean parts of your room to sustain the environment, and in exchange leave a bottle of water. Great if you only sleep in the hotel, and you want a drink to carry with you while exploring the city.If you add to your stay the breakfast, you will have available a buffet western style in the adjacent Irish Pub, which in the morning plays relaxing classical music, and from lunch typical western songs, and airing soccer matches too. Great atmosphere.There are a few issues:- staff is very nice and polite, but struggle a bit with English language. Just try your best and use Google Translate for further aid and you will be fine- the room I had was small like most in the Japan, but my wall was scratched. I told the receptionist and they solved the issue right away. - only 3 washing machines and 3 dryers are available, which means you will be waiting a lot, if you need to wash and dry your clothes.Overall, worth staying there, clearly recommended.","Adelaide, Australia","elv87</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",3,4.0

Then, I called the hotel just before leaving home. The clerk spoke horrid English, and finally put someone on who spoke a bit better and who then answered my emails, assuring me all was well. I later wrote from Seoul two days before leaving reminding of my late arrival. Received assuring email. Then, the day before I left received a request for my arrival time, threatening to cancel room. I wondered if this was the Twilight Zone. I contacted Hotels.com via Twitter and they interceded, and was then assured the room would be there. Good, considering it was 11 p.m. before I finally arrived. When I got there, I was told I had to input info on computer instead of normal check-in. I protested as I was exhausted and insisted they had to help. Only one spoke passable English. All the others hardly any, and this infuriated me, as it's outrageous that a big hotel in Tokyo wouldn't have employees to do so. Many foreigners in the hotel spoke English. The man helped me to my room, which was, unlike the other Asian hotels, ridiculously small. No drawers except in desk. I had to put my suitcase at the end of the large bed and it was difficult to move in the tiny quarters reaching for clothes. The bathroom was small, requiring an unsafe step up, about 9 inches, where one could trip in the dark. The bathtub was small but deep, requiring huge step into in order to shower. The sink was too close to tub, squeezed between the toilet, with little room. But with all the failings, the toilet had a bidet! Plus, a huge TV, with only one English channel. BBC, At one point, the phone rang, and someone informed me they wanted to change the sheets, asking when I would leave the room (it was 12:45 p.m. and I'd just showered after a long night out, having awoken late). I told her I'd be out at 1:30, and she wanted me to leave earlier, so I just hung up on her. How dare her insist that I leave my room? It's not as if it was 5 p.m. or so when the staff was going home.When leaving the hotel, I had little help getting a cab to the Shinjuku train station to take the Narita Express to the Airport. No one understood such a common transport that many no doubt took to the airport so far away. They kept thinking I wanted a cab to the airport. It was baffling trying to communicate with them at an otherwise modern looking hotel, offering a pool (in season) and free Japanese baths for the guests (I didn't partake). I was so frustrated, it being the last day of my 40-day trip and I finally raised my voice to get their attention. Again, we are talking about a mode of transport that should be familiar to them.Plus, they made me go to the street alone to hail a cab (phone cabs charge $4 just to get there), and I easily got one, but he spoke no English and didn't understand what I was saying. I managed to get one of the clerks to come out and speak with the driver, but it was maddening how they kept misunderstanding where I was going, and at one point she told me I would have to go to an area at Shinjuku Station, which I knew from my experience there was mistaken. Finally, the driver (who also must have taken zillions of passengers to this common drop-off place) understood, but how is it possible that the hotel staff would not be familiar with how to get to a major nearby train station to catch the famous Narita Express? For this reason, though superficially from the outside it looks like a nice, modern hotel and after all this time of searching it DID have coin laundry machines, because of the poor service, the tiny rooms and the very sleepy neighborhood with apartments and offices, albeit with a nearby subway only two stops from Shinjuku and not far from other sites, I have to rate the hotel low.",,Michael R,12,2.0

My family and I booked two rooms (8th floor) and stayed at this hotel for three nights.Couple of points for travellers to note:1) Check-in to this hotel is strictly 3pm! Not a minute before hand so if you plan on coming into see whether you can get a room earlier, that isn't going to happen. But the hotel is happy to keep your bags for you whilst you wander elsewhere. You can pay extra to get the room a couple of hours before hand (1,000 yen per hour).2) Public bath on Level 2 was great! Evenings are normally packed so I would recommend coming either in the morning (7-9am) or in the afternoon (at around 3pm whilst everything else is checking in). You have to bring your own towels.3) The Video on Demand which cost 1,000 yen provides you access to all the video channels for 24 hours. Although the instructions are not clear on the timing, I found out through experience!4) Lawsons and Family Mart are literally opposite the hotel so you definitely won't go hungry in the middle of the night.Finally, the rooms are on the smaller side. If you are travelling with two big bags than you will not have any floor space to walk. However, the room does have space underneath the bed that you can slide your bags to which will free up some space. But this gives you an idea.Otherwise, the room is comfortable and clean.

There’s a drug store that opens late into the night.In-house onsen – the Japanese spa on the second floor was a godsend after a long day. Not terribly authentic but adequate for my needs. I skipped the claustrophobic shower and had my wash in the onsen instead. Perfect!Automated check-in counter – the APA in Kyoto did not have it. It’s very useful given the staff’s English skills were only so-so. When checking out, I simply inserted my key card and that was it. Great idea. Tip: Pay cash to save on the exchange rate.Wifi – worked like a charm.Irish bar on the ground floor – I had arrived on the night Japan beat Colombia. I managed to catch bits of the action. The mood was fantastic! I did not have breakfast here so I can’t comment.Automated laundry – very convenient when you’ve been on the road for a while.Shinjuku-chio park about 5 minutes away. It’s small, but nice for a quick run (I ended doing a 10km, exploring Shinjuku). There’s a small shrine inside the park – pop in for a look! Cons: The pillow was utter CRAP (apparently several TripAdvisor reviewers share my sentiment) – I ended up using my travel pillow. The management really need to do something about this.Staff’s English skills are weak – if you need a lot of help with booking stuff/getting around, you may be frustrated.Pool – it’s tiny so you are looking to do laps, go elsewhere.No gym (but then again, most local hotel chains won’t have a gym). Bottom line: If you don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room, it's a top choice for single travellers.

In line with most Tokyo hotels that offer outdoor pools they don't open it until july first though.

Extremely clean rooms and amenities with hair dryer, kettle, coffee and tea, bath robes and sleepers. (The shampoo/Bath gel and Conditioner are Shisheido and smell amazing!)Really small room and bathroom but enough for 3 nights as we spent the day sightseeing.Staff almost didn’t speak English. We did the check-in on time as we weren’t allowed to do it at 12.00 when we arrived to the property so had to come back to check-in.convenient location as hotel right in front of the Subway station.Wifi in the room was almost inexistent. Advised reception staff to reset it but nothing happened. A bit disappointed that in a city like Tokyo we would have issues with internet access.","Staines, United Kingdom","E6698ABlaurap</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Staines, United Kingdom</strong>",31,3.0

The first thing that hits you once you're in your room is the size of the room, it's very small. I'm talking about walking from one end of the room to the other in less than 3 seconds, it's that small. For somebody that's booking in with six cases, you're somewhat cramped for space quite quickly. Having said that, the in-room facilities are very good, the nearest subway station's less than a minute away. I've seen another reviews talk about the pillows, and that probably explains why I was able to sleep for a maximum of three hours at a time :)Everything was fine up to the point I checked out. With the amount of cases I had I wanted the hotel to book a large taxi for me, but for reasons unknown they could only book regular sized ones. Not only that, but the staff were not able/not willing to find a cab firm that uses larger taxis, for a city as advanced as Tokyo's I thought that was ridiculous. In the end they advised me to flag down a larger taxi if I see one on the street. I found one after loitering around (with my six cases in tow) for 25-30 minutes. That's a big minus for this hotel who didn't help me in the slightest. On the plus side, my cab hailing skills have improved :)If you're a single person or travelling as a couple this hotel might be for you, but be wary if you're travelling with more than four cases.",,Ferhan M,1,3.0

They are efficient in that they fit a lot in (air con, fridge, coffee making facilities, a narrow desk with chair and a small bathroom) - just don’t expect much room for activities!As also mentioned in other reviews, the pillow is basically a flat piece of foam, about 4 inches thick. (I slept with it folded over), but you may want to request additional pillows before you arrive.The internet here is basically non existent in the evenings. If you’re English speaking, I’d suggest downloading a few movies to your device as there’s no English channels (on the massive TV) and streaming just wasn’t happening for me.The Onsen is a nice novelty (as a Westerner) and I made use of the self service laundry facilities.The pool is only open from July (or maybe June?) - September, which isn’t mentioned on their website, so don’t bother bringing your swimsuit if you’re not there during those months.It’s located about a 30 min walk from Shibuya or Shinjuku station, so if you’re not up for taxis or trying to figure out the rail system bring comfortable walking shoes.Overall I’d more liken this hotel to an upscale hostel than “an efficient hotel” as they claim.If you just need a bed (which was very comfortable bar the pillow issue), this place is fine, but if you can afford a little bit more I’d look at staying in a more established place.","Dublin, Ireland","therugbytraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",5,3.0

The rooms are tiny, even by Tokyo standards, but are quite functional. So small that there is no room to have an open suitcase at all times, so must be placed under the bed. The mattresses are somewhat firm but very comfortable and immaculately cleaned. The view from our room of central Tokyo was amazing. There are multiple convenience stores, restaurants and even a McDonalds within a 5 minute walk from the hotel. **PILLOW PROBLEM** : The bean/rice pillows supplied are extremely firm and very uncomfortable by western standards. We managed to get 2 soft western pillows but the hotel has a very limited supply. I recommend that the hotel get more western pillows and make sure to request ASAP. The lobby, pool and onsen facilities seem nice but we did not use them so cannot comment other than aesthetics. All in all, great hotel if you don’t mind the small rooms, and make sure to get a soft pillow if you’re not used to hard ones.

I asked to get another kind or more pillow to support my neck, but there were no pillow available! They charged about $140 per night including breakfast, but breakfast selection were ok and I felt I wasted $14 for breakfast. Their room was way too small to feel comfortable and overcharging for their service. Only good part is they have a big spa on the second floor, but I was supposed they even didn’t supply extra towels and water fountain.

Well thought of design especially the sockets n lights control within bed area. Huge screen for entertainment. Pillow very flat, asked for 2 nights, no extra pillow. Staff and manager stated that hotel cannot reserved pillows for all guests. What a ridiculous statement! Obviously the pillow is too flat and guests are asking for more pillows. The management must do something, suggested they should buy more pillows if there is demand. The service is not befitting their acclaimed “Simplified Luxury”, “Japan Pride” and “You’ll be back”, statements.
