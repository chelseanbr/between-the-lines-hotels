The rooms are nice and the location is great but for the price that includes a sneaky 45$ ""service charge"", and ironically we were disappointed in the service. The service charge has ""perks"" that we found to be not worth it (wine and cheese for one hour which was cheap wine, cut up cheddar, and crackers as an example). The room service is overpriced as room service often is but then on top of that there is gratuity and a $10 service fee built it, making it around $32 for a BLT. If we are paying a $45 a night service charge, why do we need to pay yet more money just to actually get service in the hotel? On top of that, when the time came when we actually needed service as an incident at the hotel caused damage to our belongings, no one apologized or tried to make the situation better, only doing the bare minimum when we asked for help. I had to throw out some of my belongings and actually lost money as a result of their poor service. We followed up via e-mail and we still have not gotten a response more than a week later. Where is this service charge coming in hand now? Also the bed was uncomfortable and the room was loud. The glass windows, location, and shower were very nice and the most redeeming quality but also comparable to other places we have stayed in NYC.Bottom line, if you want luxury you won't get it from here despite paying luxury prices, and their whole concept of ""service"" can create a bad vibe for your NYC vacation.","Helsinki, Finland","kayseapea</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsinki, Finland</strong>",0,2.0

To begin, my online reservation, although confirmed on the website, was not found upon check-in. The receptionist was kind enough to help and sort things out, and luckily a room similar to what I reserved was available for the 7 days we were to spend in New York. The room, although advertised as a corner studio, implying some form of spaciousness, was surprisingly small, measuring at around 300 square feet. While the view from the room was pleasing, and the presence of floor-to-ceiling windows helped, the room still felt cramped, especially with two suitcases around. The hotel's day-to-day housekeeping was carried out without a hitch, however any other services beyond that were frustrating. Orders for water bottles and in-room dining took long to be brought up, sometimes requiring more than one follow-up call. Not to mention the very limited in-room dining options, which disappear after 11 PM, requiring you to order food from outside. As for the available amenities, there aren't many. The hotel lobby is relatively small, with a few couches, at which you can have complimentary thermos coffee in a paper cup and scones in the morning, and complimentary bottled wine, saltine crackers, and one kind of cheese in the evening - which feels somewhat cheap. The only redeeming factor for The James SOHO is its amazing location, which puts you at walking distance from most interesting attractions in lower Manhattan, the east village and west village, in addition to its vibrant rooftop lounge.","Kuwait City, Kuwait","chaker_elmo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuwait City, Kuwait</strong>",1,3.0

While on the edge of Soho, it feels entirely connected. Like many hotels, its fitness room (a priority for us as frequent travelers is modest, but adequate); its primary restaurant (which we used once for breakfast) is fine, if not exceptional (we were there during winter, so were unable to take advantage of what appear to be terrific outdoor terrace spaces).

Upon arrival I was extremely disappointed in the size of the room . I booked a corner king in hopes of having more space but it was small and the only place to sit was a bench against a window, a wirey chair and the bed. To kick of the weekend festivities we headed to the bar Jimmy on the 17th floor only to find out it was closed for a private party (wait, shouldn't paying guests of the hotel have access to the only bar? Closed by outsiders?) headed to the attached restaurant for plan B only to find it too was closed for a private party. it was raining like mad and our only option was to slog down the street to Il Mulino for a drink (where they were incredibly friendly and welcoming!). When we got back to the hotel after dinner looking for an after dinner drink , everything was still closed for a private party. I complained to management and they brought a container of cranberry juice and some limes. I tried to order drinks for in room delivery but apparently they only have beer and wine. Big disappointment all around--not a cheap room--over $850 per night. I know it's NYC in December but I expected better service and acknowledgment that this was so not cool--I'm fairly certain we were not the only truly disappointed guests.",,Shirleysmom,1,2.0

We were several hours early for check-in, but the night manager Shefi was more than accommodating. He took our bags and stored them for us, so we could relax in the warm lobby on a couch. He offered us scones and coffee as we relaxed for a while, we were exhausted from the previous days travels. Another associate named Kenny was just awesome. He recommended several places we could eat breakfast that morning and for the rest of our trip. He gave a variety of recommendations and they were all great. Many places didn't open up for an hour or longer, but he suggested we went downstairs to a local deli that serves food 24 hours a day. In fact, he walked us downstairs, out of the hotel, and into the deli. He introduced us to the staff and said once our food was ready, to come back into the hotel and enjoy it there. The food was solid, service was great, both guys were very nice. Shefi was able to get us our room hours before we had expected. It made the trip for us, couldn't imagine if we weren't able to get that power nap in, could've made for an exhausting Saturday. Kenny was generous enough to gift us a couple of drink coupons to the rooftop bar, we used them the following evening. The room was clean, had a lovely view, and everything we could've asked or.

There are a few issues that I believe other readers need to be aware of. Overall the hotel is very well located but I don’t think this is reasonable to call it a 5 stars hotel. 1. When I checked in there was some chips on the floor. I appreciate that the cleaning ladies can do mistakes but this was very surprising and unpleasant. The room looks quite old. The bathroom seemed clean though. I am staying on the 16th floor so used stairs to go to the gym on the 17th - but the stairs are extreely dirty, with some fruits and insects. This was disgusting 2. I suffered from strong headache (not the hotel fault unfortunately) and the permanent noise during the day, in the corridor was just too much. I called the reception several times but nothing happened. For people looking for some rest or needing to sleep during the day because of the jet lag - just look for another place.

In fact as a regular customer they in the past recognized that and always would give upgrades to show I was appreciated. This trip the front desk staff put me in a terrible room with no view. I told the young lady I am a regular customer and always get a room with a city view. She made no attempt to accommodate my request. I had to change hotel rooms three times because the room was unsatisfactory. I eventually settled for a room with a city view but the locking mechanism because broken.

The staff of the hotel really made us feel welcomed and cared for thanks and I will for sure book this hotel again when going to NYC. ",,JennaiBMiami,1,5.0

For the significantly high price point per night, I did not get the experience I would have imagined. I will say, the staff is friendly, and that was were the positives end. I stayed here on business for 3 nights. Upon check in, our 3 rooms were not ready. When we finally were able to get into the rooms, they seem very cool from the looks of it, but functionality-wise were super inefficient. The water guage on both the shower and the sink were inconsistent - upon turning on the water would always be boiling hot and took long while to cool down. I ended up having to brush my teeth with bottled water as I did not have time to wait for the water to become a normal temperature. The light switches did not make sense and seemed to not be connected with anything. There were little outlets - only 1 surge protector/power strip on the floor (with little give). The elevators always took forever. And then to top it off, we were transporting extremely expensive equipment. When we (finally) found the bellman and asked if he can watch our cart of gear for 5 minutes while we grabbed a coffee across the street, we come back to our gear with no one around. No one watching it. We simply carted out our gear on our own, which wasnt a problem, but it could have been anyone who took the gear out of the hotel as no one was watching it. I stay in a lot of hotels that are much cheaper than this, especially in New York, and expect a higher level of service and amenities than I received. Likely will not stay again.","Cleveland, Ohio","Taylor216</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cleveland, Ohio</strong>",16,2.0

So we decided to stay in NYC for 5 more days but switch from busy Times Square to the calmer Soho area and we booked at the James Hotel.The hotel design wise is amazing. Lots of lights come in through huge windows at the reception area and in the rooms. From the rooftop bar you can enjoy breathtaking views on different parts of New York. We personally were on the 10th floor and therefore didn’t hear any music in our room at night. However it does get busy up there on weekends. We felt that the cocktails were over overpriced (+-22 dollars incl tax), this is even more than what we pay here in Switzerland for a cocktail. Waiters get rude when you don’t tip them.However, the big plus of this Hotel is the staff (excluding barmen). The lobby guys are fantastic. Kenny greeted us and was extremely friendly, kind, proactive and helpful. The James Hotel can be (very) lucky to have a guy like him.. hard to find such friendly people nowadays in the hospitality branch.The reception team was amazing as well and was very helpful the few times we reached out to them.All in all I would give 4 stars - but thanks to the reception team and Kenny, I have no choice than to give a solid 5 star review.See you soon James Hotel!","Geneva, Switzerland","GVAtraveler-1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>",20,4.0

He went out of his way to bring my bags to my room, offered me a bottle of wine on the house, and a drink ticket for the rooftop bar. Kenny made up for the front desk’s initial mistake which impressed me. Not only was Kenny a rockstar but Eric, also at the entry doors, gave great service. I was already checked in but was waiting for my Uber to head to an interview around 4:30pm on a Wednesday. I’m from out of town so once Eric knew I had to be somewhere at a specific time, he went the extra mile and hailed me a cab to make sure I was where I needed to be on time.

The general daytime atmosphere of the hotel is friendly enough and the rooms and public areas are bright and clean. The first disappointment we encountered was that the pool was closed every day at 4 so they coulld prep the area ready for evening when it became a roof top bar area for over 21s only (residents and non-residents). From 5 pm the vibe of the hotel changed completely with all these bouncers everywhere who came across as quite intimidating. This applies to the downstairs bar areas too. I don’t mind an edgy vibe but unfortunately, this was more seedy than edgy.With regards to the rest of the facilities, as I said room was nice. Housekeeping were a bit sloppy with replenishing cups and other tea/coffee supplies but towels and other guest amenities were well stocked. Room service food was simple but tasty. Gym was good and the complimentary wine available in the lobby during happy hour was most enjoyable. They could do with a better breakfast option. Coffee flasks and pastries in the lobby doesn’t really cut it. However, they did have a number of restaurants across the road and next door that was part of the hotel but again it just seemed a bit dark and nightclub like.

Hence, I truly value the energy of a place where the staff seems genuinely caring and thoughtful. Even the gentlemen who helped with my suitcases where enthusiastic and kind. Great vibe from the whole staff I interacted with which is rare these days :) The property is beautiful, super modern with a design aesthetic a bit artsy and cool.

No biggie, just for $20 a drink , i would’ve expected some wait service. Other than that, an amazing perk to have in the summer. The only tip would be - avoid the noise on the 17th floor due to the workers setting up for the club upstairs. If you are adverse to noise, skip the 17th.

First off, I reserved for two other couples and myself and got charged the first night for all three rooms, before we even left home. Even though rooms were identified by my friends names. Really nice apology by front desk person upon check in, then he proceeded to charge my friends full stay on my card! While she was standing there holding her credit card! Nice apology by manager, though. Now I have about $4,000 in charges on my credit card for 3-5 days while they reverse it. If you’re wanting your room to be cleaned around 5:00 pm, no matter what time you leave in the morning, this is the hotel for you! Oh, front desk says to ask for someone to come earlier in the day...every day! Guess there’s no guest notes or preferences. Nice coffee amenity in the morning in lobby but it’s usually empty. Nice wine amenity in lobby at 5:00 pm but there are no glasses and bottles are mostly already empty. If you want breakfast in hotel, it has to be room service because there is NO restaurant here. Pillows are like rocks. You can request down pillows but for some reason they will be removed every day so we all had to keep requesting them again. If you enjoy paying a lot for great location but zero service this is the hotel for you! And be sure you check out the pay first, stay after policy because they are the winners take all when it comes to this! So enjoy your stay! I did not, sadly.

No one we spoke to could give us a straight answer on how to get them. One gentleman (we'll call him G, since providing names isn't one of James Hotel's strong suits) said we'd have to purchase a platter. Nothing in the booking said we had to purchase anything to receive the free welcome cocktail. In fact, the $40/night fee was paired with them saying we'd get a few things in return (that we never did).Funnily, G was standing right next to another person (manager?) after we brought it (and other items) to their intention. The manager said we were misinformed. When we noted the person standing right next to him literally just told us about the required pre-purchase, G just looked away and shrugged his shoulders.For the price, the room is very small even by NYC standards. While it notes floor to ceiling windows, they mean feet-above-the-floor-to-ceiling. Which is probably a good thing, considering they have the worst sound insulation (if any) of any place in NYC. The old surge protector on the night stand and randomly unplugged devices (lamp, iHome) were a nice touch. Do not go by what you see in the pictures.We were excited about the idea of hitting the pool. Maybe we accidentally booked on a birthday for teenagers, but it was hardly possible when even getting to our *room* was met with battling the crowds of teens / kids? on the elevators. There was a female apparently trying to operate the elevators, and she let us on eventually when the pool party attendants were set. So nice of them to let guests into their rooms!Had hoped for a more mature, fun bar pool setting versus what felt like an open pool in the middle of the day for teenagers, but that's not necessarily the hotel's fault. I understand that the pool/ bar area aren't the responsibility of the hotel (they made that abundantly clear when we addressed some of the issues with them). Ultimately, the noise became unbearable. We tolerated the first night because we checked in so late. The noise was especially intense late evening. We recorded what sounds like grinding and shifting. The second night added sounds of glasses dropping and scratching. Hoping it was just from construction or the bar and would fade, it actually woke us up the next morning.When we brought some of the issues we had in the evening, the manager said he was sorry, that they couldn't control what happened with the bar or other noise. During construction, hotels usually provide earplugs or a warning. At the James, it's apparently just not their issue. To the manager's credit, he did offer to upgrade us when we said we planned to leave (we were scheduled to stay for 3 additional days). But at that point, the noise was only one of a variety of issues. We checked out first thing the next morning (thanks, early AM noises, for making sure of that!).I almost raised the review to two-stars, because our last experience with the hotel was with a doorman we hadn't seen at that point, who was polite, prompt, and helpfully opened the doors for us and assisted with our luggage as we left. We told him that alone was night and day from everything else we'd received.The total cost for two nights was almost $1000. For that much, we could have stayed on Park Ave. with better food, better bars, no kids, no noise, and better entertainment. In fact, we got all of that at the next hotel for (much) less near Park Ave!If it weren't for the room making such a terrible first impression, and various staff (especially G) giving us the runaround, we might have stayed through our scheduled booking. Of course there will be weekends where noise and non-guests will be a factor in any hotel, especially one that's open to the public. But the cost, lack of ownership by (most, not all) of the staff, and lack of amenities just don't add up.","Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","JoeJTSJoe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma</strong>",4,1.0

It is in an excellent location, has amazing rooftop views, the beds are very comfortable and the heated bathroom floor is a definite bonus. We had a 6th floor corner king, so, while the sunlight was great, we weren’t able to take in the views the higher floors offer. (We requested a higher floor but none were available.). The wine and cheese are a nice touch and the cookies and scones are amazing!!!! Unfortunately, this is where the greatness seems to end. For a 4-5 star hotel, they miss the mark on service. The hotel is VERY focused on the rooftop bar and almost seems to let the hotel and hotel guests take a back seat. After 5 pm it is near impossible to take an elevator to your room - especially if trying to catch one on the lobby (2nd floor). You are better to go to the ground floor to go up and hope you aren’t pushed out of the way by rooftop patrons. The hotel seems very understaffed with one person working the lobby area/registration desks, rarely a doorman or concierge to be found. The room was small, but to be expected in NYC. We had a very slow sink drain that was finally repaired after repeated requests - on the third of a four day stay. Worse, housekeeping never cleaned the residue from the slow drain. Walls are scuffed, curtain stained and a lot of dust and dirt build up on floor boards. There was a nice floor lamp - if you wanted to plug/unplug as needed. We could hear the guests above us every time they walked across the floor. tv would occasionally lose cable/satellite connection and you couldn’t access guest services etc.Unfortunately, this one did not live up to our expectations. Perhaps they were too high given the website and our past experiences with James hotels? Go for the location/views/rooftop party.

You can walk to the West Village, Greenwich village, Downtown, Lower East Side, and many subway stops. My wife and I are walkers so the location was a huge plus for us. If you want to shop till you drop, there are many many places nearby to spend $$$$. The hotel: Enjoyed the views from the rooftop. There’s a bar, indoor seating area, wading pool, and outdoor seating as well. Hallways and public areas look well maintained and clean. Large windows surround the lobby which brings in a lot of light. The design throughout the hotel is definitely modern but there are lots of warm tones that add a “homey” feeling to the spaces. Service: The door guys are really helpful. When we checked in they held our bags until our room was ready. Every time we needed a cab, they got one for us in a jiffy. Need an umbrella? They can also get those for you. Front desk staff were quick, efficient, and friendly. They gave us complimentary drink tickets so we went up to the rooftop bar and had some drinks while we waited for our room. We didn’t do room service or needed a valet so I can’t speak to those services. The room: We booked a suite with a separate living area and bedroom. It was very spacious and well appointed. The view from the 16th floor was stunning. Although we enjoyed our stay, there’s definitely room for improvement. On arrival, there were several issues with the room (housekeeping and engineering related). I won’t list them here because it was properly dealt with. I would say the room could use a refresh - couch pillows look worn, the bed was too lumpy and soft, and power strips behind the side tables are not efficient (don’t like reaching behind to plug things in!)Overall we really enjoyed our stay but we did encounter various issues with the room (which were acknowledged and resolved by the hotel staff).","San Francisco, California","shipwrecked415</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",39,4.0

The good touches are the scones, fruit, cheese and biscuits in the lounge at different times of day; and the corner rooms are very pleasant indeed. Now the poor aspects of which there are far too many. I don't think that there are enough staff: when I arrived, the doorman was nowhere to be seen and so I had to lug my luggage up to the Reception. I was early for check in and so the desk staff told me that they would call me when my room was ready - but they didn't. One had often to ask the staff to replenish the coffee or the cheese and biscuits in the lounge area.- they tended to ignore it. The windows of my room were dirty, which spoiled one of the views. The outside terrace was not particularly inviting: they should have prepared it already for Spring. There is a roof top bar which attracts lots of younger people - not a bad thing but it meant that the lifts were irritatingly slow in the evenings. But worst of all was that I received an email on my very first evening from management inviting my comments - and despite the fact that I responded with some of the above, they never condescended either to acknowledge my email or to provide me with a substantive reply. That tells one something about the general approach in the hotel. So, a long list of irritations (above) but, fundamentally, still a very good hotel. Yet far short of how good it used to be.

So many hotels give you a view of another brick building or a courtyard, this was a nice treat. $10 per day to use in the mini bar, that was cool too! Our first night was rainy and cold so we tried to go downstairs (w/o reservations) to Gitano, and unfortunately they were booked, it was a cool trendy place, I would have made reservations had I known. Our second night was beautiful weather, so before dinner we figured we'd head to their rooftop The Jimmy for our free drinks, before we got into the elevator we could hear loud music coming down the shaft, the elevator going up was packed, once we got up there, we realized we were at a pretty popular rooftop w/ a DJ etc. at 6:30 pm. It took a bit to get our drinks, but the view and sunset was gorgeous for our short stay before dinner. We had ordered room service breakfast and that was probably the most disappointing- waffles were too cold and rubbery for butter to melt . Not a huge deal, but for $70 just get ready and go out some place near by in soho or tribeca. Also if you want a late checkout, call early, they couldn't accommodate us because they had given out too many already that morning. Otherwise awesome stay and location!","West Babylon, New York","Ktravels28</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Babylon, New York</strong>",44,5.0

This is a true boutique hotel with a lovely, sort of hidden away-feeling entrance (you ride up a glass elevator out of what feels like a residential entry foyer) to a cozy lobby decorated with some truly spectacular art — love the Lindsey Adelman chandeliers throughout! We were exhausted and starving after a day of delayed travel; front desk employees were polite, laid back, and lightening fast (think they sensed we wanted to get up to the room as soon as possible & were very accommodating.) They made sure we were able to get onto the wifi before we headed upstairs to our room. The room itself feels classic Soho: floor to ceiling windows, very efficient use of space, industrial touches mixed with rich dark chocolate tones, very well thought out. The complimentary glass bottled water, hardwood floors, fast & efficient 24-hour room service, heavenly smelling en-shower amenities, and lack of street noise all add up to what feels like a true 5 star boutique hotel.

Starting with the positives:- Rooms and bathrooms are clean, light and well appointed. House keeping did an excellent job each day. Bed was very comfy- Receptionists and those on the desk on the ground floor were all very friendly- Free wine each evening was very nice- Great location, close to main Soho and easy access to Subway- Good value for NYC- Views from Rooftop bar were stunningThe not so good:- Requested a quiet room but was told the only room available was close to lifts ( this was after check in time). I said I would take it as I didn't want to wait for another room to become available. The lift noise was fine - however the noise from Jimmys was unbelievably loud on the Saturday evening and this wasn't mentioned to me at check in.- Welcome cocktails are only given if you book dinner at the restaurant . We didn't want to eat at the hotel as we had already made reservations for our stay so we didn't get these drinks. As your welcome drinks are supposedly included in your resort fee they should be included regardless of whether you have dinner or not- There is free coffee and biscuits provided each morning. They should provide tea for any non coffee drinkers. Personally I think mini croissants or something similar would be more popular than the biscuits as there seemed to be a heap of them left over each morning- There is 10 dollars credit for the minibar each day of your stay. There was no price list in my room so I had to ask at reception. Items that I took weren't replaced - is this to make you buy the items that cost more that 10dollars?- Staff at Jimmys were not friendly at all with the exception of the girls that did table service. Overall, I would stay here again as I loved the views, the bedrooms and the location is great.","Dublin, Ireland","neesonf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",34,4.0

What you need to know when making reservations--If you want a view, I suggest you call the hotel to define what they consider a ""view"". Rooms that claim ""city"" views I believe are the 1-7 floor (I may have the floor incorrect). You'll be looking into the buildings across the street. Skyline views are on the upper floors. City view refers to ""tribeca"" while skyline is of NYC. We stayed on a corner king on the 10th floor. Which has skyline views out both windows. The room is small, typical room size for a NYC hotel. The little bench seating and table make it fine for two people.The customer service was what you would want from a 4-star hotel.

The James came to us with a solid recommendation and with so many choices for places to stay, we hoped that we'd picked a winner. Let's just say we were less than impressed. The property is tired and not especially clean. Elevators had fingerprints all over them and debris on the floors. Room itself was tired, a little banged up, lights that were dirty and hardwood floors that were noisy (especially when our neighbours above arrived home at 1AM in the morning). Seating in the room itself was a wire chair with some fabric on it and a bench against the wall. The shower leaked all over the bathroom floor. Terrible pump bottles for soap and shampoo did not fit properly in their holders. Staff seemed more interested in their computer screens than their guests. The one exception was Paul who was at the front door when we arrived - friendly, helpful and had a great smile. The bar that seems to be part of the hotel and rocks the weekend evenings can make for an unsavoury welcome back to the property with an entrance full of rowdy party people and noisy music. The complementary drink that we had as part of our package could only be claimed if you made a dinner reservation at a restaurant attached to the hotel.

I had a dinner in SoHo and a work meeting the next day. All I needed was a place to leave my belongings while I went to dinner, a quiet place to sleep, and work for a few hours the next morning. To their credit I was upgraded from a queen room to a king room upon check in. I would never book this hotel again. Once I was in my room the first low point was no desk. But rather a tiny little circular table. Beyond that the room layout was hip/modern. Only problem was that a few of the light switched were broken. Then the sounds started. I have no clue what was going on but at 6pm in the evening it sounded like a bucket of marbles was being dumped over my room every 3-4 minutes for about an hour. I literally have no clue what it was: Weird guest up above or, what seemed more likely, elevator noises echoing through air duct systems. Anyway, I left, went to dinner, and upon my return did not hear these noises. But then at precisely 6am it literally sounded like a tea kettle was whistling / screeching in the hallway. I figured it had to be outside of my room but after it persisted for over 5 minutes I crawled out of bed and closer to the door to investigate. It was screaming in directly from the vent in the ceiling of my bathroom. Clueless as to what caused this. Hot water early morning showers and old pipes and water heaters? But it was LOUD. 15 minutes later it stopped. 45 minutes after that it was the sound of footsteps on hardwood in the room above me. At first I dismissed it as ""this has to be above me"" but actually had to look around to make sure there was nobody in my room. It was that loud (and yes, I realize that at this point a reader of this review could possible ask ""maybe this reviewer is nuts and is hearing things?"".Bottom line, spent a sizable chunk of cash for a small room, with some broken fixtures, and the craziest sounds I've ever heard in a hotel which stopped me from sleeping.","Brooklyn, New York","Darren S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",25,2.0

However, I just saw J4506KUnickl's one-star review from Nov 15, describing almost the same experience. For me, I am so appalled at the James and the behavior of the manager that I had to share with others.In November, a surprise snow storm hit NYC. I spent hours in a taxi trying to get to the airport when my flight was finally cancelled. With so many flights being cancelled, hotel rooms were selling out fast throughout NYC. I booked a room at the James on Hotels.com for the night, and arrived about 30 minutes later. However, when I did arrive, reception claimed they did not have my reservation (even though I showed them my confirmation number). The manager came out and said there was no way I could have booked a room in the last half hour as the hotel had been sold out for several hours. From the other review, it appears that about 40 customers were told the same due to a ""computer glitch."" However, I was the only one in the lobby trying to check in at this point, so wasn't aware this was a larger issue at the hotel. So, with no other options, I booked another room on Hotels Tonight. (As a side note, Hotels.com showed no rooms available in all of Manhattan at this point!).Fast forward a month and I see a charge on my bill for over $500 at the James New York - SoHo. I tried to resolve with Hotels.com to no avail. And here is the rub -- they called the manager who was on duty that night at the James. Even though he spoke to me in person and said they had no rooms, he told Hotels.com that I never showed up for my reservation, and so they billed me as a no-show! I have my booking confirmations, I have Uber reciepts showing I was dropped off at the James and picked up again 20 minutes later (to go to my eventual hotel that night), etc. And now, there is a comment from the manager confirming this was happening for many customers in response to J4506KUnickl's review! And yet, the manager continues to tell Hotels.com that I was a no-show. I'm still in the midst of resolving the bill with Hotels.com (another disappointment after years of being a loyal and frequent customer), but remain appalled that this hotel will fabricate stories in order to secure billings, all at the expense of the customer.

I’m the first to say I’m particular based on being from hospitality industry for many years and traveled to NYC many times and my review—wow. We chose this place among others for weekend getaway with husband without kids for my bday. We used Chase credit card points to book this place—had many options but chose this place based on location, reviews which honestly were mixed. But they exceeded expectations by long shot. Why? First tip—utilize your concierge services. (As former concierge, I know this) my NYC friend couldn’t get reservation at Italian place she liked. But one call to Leidy at The James and she nailed it. I talked with her, told her our desires and she called me back next day with reservation no one else in NYC could get. Win! That was just the start. Then Terrell helped us-on my terms- get to Times Square for theatre tickets on time. He texted me how to most efficiently get there with step-by-step instructions via subway to avoid traffic vs taxi/Lyft/Uber. We easily arrived with time to spare. Lovely. Some other places say “I can write down instructions or just look up”. He accommodated my last-minute request with ease, sent me text with info. Perfect, lovely accommodating guest in mode I wanted vs “how I was told or how we do it”. Thank you Then, when we needed to shift reservation for meal at Union Square Cafe (my fav restaurant in NYC) and husband could not get reso when we wanted, Leidy, once again called and worked her magic to get us a reservation that more accommodated our needs. And proactively called us to let us know. The room—amazingly big for Manhattan standards with lovely view. Heated floors in bathroom is biggest thing that comes to mind, along with view. Attention to detail in the room re: shading, heat, privacy, etc. Didn’t have ton of ammeneities but if you ask—they will bring makeup mirror, extra mint tea, toothpaste. All quickly, easily. Thank you. Just ask, these people want to help make your stay pleasant. Really appreciate the empowered advice culture. Also coffee and wine appreciated. And loved the rooftop bar, even in winter, was beautiful, fun and added a different experience to calm, quite, zen-like feeling I t eh hotel. Just look these lovely people in the eye, ask for what you want and they will go above and beyond to help make your stay excellent. Really lovely 4-night stay. One suggestion?

First things first, the hotel was not cheap and certainly amongst the top 10% or so in the city. Therefore I did have high expectations and for me, a great hotel is very important when I'm on holiday. Overall my stay was very good but i'll summarise all the details below.My resort fee was included in the package I booked with my travel provider but I would have felt VERY hard done by if I had to shell out the $48 daily otherwise. I have read that only a small selection of NYC hotels charge this and it's a ruse to advertise a lower room rate, it's completely unjustified. It covers local/national calls, use of the gym, some minor amenities like free water/wine/occasional snacks in the lobby as well as a $10 daily minibar credit. To be honest, that daily credit barely covered one bottle of water or a chocolate bar. Perhaps I shouldn't moan as my fee was waived with the deal but most will have to pay this and it's extortionate for amenities that should be included as an absolute basic in a luxury hotel. Covering some phone calls, a gym which any decent hotel should have etc, for $48 daily?!When arriving the first notable thing was the amazing location. Super easy to get to from the subway, particularly useful for a total stranger to the area, it's literally surrounded by all the different lines for Canal Street. As I got to know the area it was even more evident that it was excellently located, great restaurants, places for breakfast and world class shops very close by, all in a very safe feeling neighbourhood.My room was pretty high up with an amazing view, I was exhausted so didn't take too much notice of the room. However, by the morning I did notice some real basics were missing-no hand soap, no glasses by the sink, the electric privacy blind between the bathroom and bedroom didn't just not work, it didn't actually exist-it must have been removed. Some of the lighting didn't work either and I just didn't think this was good enough. To their credit, without me even drawing a breath to explain the individual problems, the staff immediately offered a replacement when I asked the next morning. My belongings were moved over and the new room was great.The rooms themselves (I was in a king size room) are surprisingly small but not overly so. There is plenty of storage, great floor to ceiling views too. The bathroom is very good, luxuriously decked out, great shower and I loved the Appelles toiletries provided-this luxurious touch made a real difference. The bed was one of the best I've ever stayed in, very comfortable and they also offered a pillow menu so I got a few extras to my taste. I would not recommend going unless you're either by yourself or in a couple, the rooms are intimate and the 'privacy blinds' in the bathroom probably aren't fully effective.The housekeepers were super friendly and did a great job daily. I did notice though that some basics were missed, I cannot fault them and would not personally blame them as I fully expect they have very sharp turnaround times and will not be earning mega bucks. However, amenities weren't replaced properly-if I used a product it just wasn't replaced and I also had to use the same dirty soap bar all week. The sink was left a bit dirty daily. When I used the minibar (although extortionately priced I had a $10 daily credit as above), the items were never replaced-so I soon ran out of water and other snacks. Was this a ruse to get me to start using the other products in there? Saying that, you did get a large daily bottle of free filtered water so it wasn't like I was desperate.The only real downside of the room is the noise-mainly from above and the surroundings. With wooden floors and less than ideal soundproofing, I had to use very sturdy earplugs each night. Additionally, the huge windows were badly soundproofed and even from the equivalent of probably 15 or more floors up (the whole hotel is above an elevated lobby) I could easily hear traffic noise.TV was good and could be controlled via an app to make it easier. Also noticed a bluetooth speaker/alarm clock which was handy.Tried the gym once and it was perfectly good with state of the art cardio machines, also amazing views in there. Small though but I doubt many people use it. Didn't use the pool as it was November...The James has a rooftop bar and it seems to be privately owned, so many members of the public would be wandering into the hotel all evening. They would also use the lifts to get there (it's top floor) which I didn't think was that secure for guests, nor did it make me feel that special-more like we're just getting in the way of customers trying to get to a swanky bar. Having to wait for lifts because of random external guests was frustrating.The building itself was nice, I think it's about 7-8 years old. Very nice lobby but my weird personal view of the hotel itself is from the outside it looks pretty awful, no interesting architecture apart from the aforementioned lobby (and rooftop) and it could be a holiday inn from the outside, not a luxury hotel.Staff were always very helpful so no complaints at all there.Tried the David Burke kitchen a few times, once for breakfast which was fine but nothing that special, once for lunch which was a very well cooked meal but very expensive indeed for what it was (I'm talking about $40+ for a chicken breast and french fries). Loads and loads of decent alternatives only moments away, you do get a 10% discount at the DB Kitchen apparently but they never actually honoured it for me! I didn't take this any further.All in all I would recommend it and the location is spot on, especially nice to get away from the really crowded areas after a busy day. I did get a decent package but paying the full advertised rates I definitely wouldn't be doing. I feel like they could add a few more luxury touches to make guests feel special, even if really basic-how about chocolates or a little treat left in your room daily? How about a special deal with some local restaurants? What else can they think of to make guests feel more special? I'm only being really fussy based on the prices they charge but that's a good thing as there's not many negative things to say!","London, United Kingdom","sturgeon2k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",21,4.0

We went up to check it out, and the elevator doors open to a super loud club DJ and a packed bar and swimming pool area. There were a couple of bikini girls in the pool, and lots of fancy Jersey Shore-dressed types of people packing the perimeter so you couldn't really get to enjoy the view from the roof. the bar was crowded too, so we didn't try to get a drink.

First time it had just opened, second time was a few months after that, and the third was exactly 5 years later (to the date).All in all, its still the same James: minimalist, good enough but they don't spoil you in anyway.Areas for improvements:1. Rooms are too bright, the moment the sun comes up, you're going to wake up (unless you don't mind sunlight)2. Housekeeping is good, but it's a bit like housekeeping at home; if you don't follow up and remind them to refill certain amenities/ mini bar, they might not. If you don't inform them that you're leaving, they may forget to make the room (happened a couple times).3. Concierge service is friendly, but don't expect to get that ""impossible booking"" through your hotel, might as well book yourself.4. If you're in a room that's close to the elevator, expect to hear every single time the elevator moves - very annoying.In terms of location, probably the best (for me) in NYC, and their AC system in the room is pretty good (if you like to sleep in a cold room, you'll love theirs).They also have coffee and muffins in the morning (complimentary) as well as wine and cheese in the evening; though the fact that they moved it down to the restaurant as opposed to the lobby is a bit of an annoyance; particularly in the morning.Next time I visit NYC, I would hesitate to go back, not necessarily from any shortcomings on this side, but if you're like me and you enjoy being spoilt rotten on a vacation, this may not be the place for you - if you like things simple and to the point, they do that very well.","Lagos, Nigeria","NahiHalabi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lagos, Nigeria</strong>",29,4.0

The mini bar is well kept and offers a great selection. My favorite part of the room was definitely the heated floors in the bathroom though. My girlfriends and I couldn't stop talking about how amazing they were. We also had a great time at The Jimmy upstairs and David Burke Kitchen, both of which have thoughtfully-crafted cocktails. The Garden is such a beautiful escape from the busy city, and they allow dogs too! I had a fantastic time both times and would definitely recommend it. The atmosphere is so fun and lively.

I love modern architecture, but, this building is a failure in both form & function from the lobby and elevators to the rooftop ""pool"". We booked a corner room which was decent sized, on the bigger side for NYC. The bathroom is definitely larger than average, well designed with a good shower and for a hotel that's 8 years old, I give credit to the designer for being ahead of the curve. Also, the bed has good linens and is very comfortable. Aside from that, the layout and common areas of this hotel were a disappointment. We made sure to spend as much time out and about to avoid doing anything but sleep there, which isn't hard to do in Manhattan. I suggest spending less if just want a bed and you're planning to be working or sightseeing most of your stay OR spend a little more (or even less in some cases!) if you want more of a luxury or edgy city hotel experience that’s memorable for good reasons. The James Soho staff were polite, but, from what I experienced, the hotel is obviously understaffed to the point of the person at the front desk might be the same person delivering your ice. Look elsewhere if you’re hoping to have some amazing rooftop pool or experience or you just want a nice rooftop bar like The Standard High Line (nice rooms, no pool, but great atmosphere). The James Soho rooftop pool is more like the size of a large hot tub. Forget about relaxing by this pool since by 9am guests and non guests (I wasn't sure if they have some sort or membership for locals or people just showed up) are jockeying for sun chairs on the roof. There’s supposed to be a separate entrance and elevator for rooftop bar patrons but we shared plenty of elevators with people from morning into night who snuck in as well. At night, we ended up using the stairs instead of the elevator because we got tired of the elevator doors opening to reveal a packed group of bar patrons.BTW if you didn't catch it when you booked your reservation or maybe they mentioned it during check in, The James Soho adds their own $40 nightly “resort fee” which isn't uncommon with hotels with actual amenities, but, here, what resort? For random wine in the lobby in the afternoon? For “use of the pool” which is a joke since they'd rented out the pool area for an entire day which not only denied us access to the pool and bar but created a line for elevators? We enjoyed shopping and dining in the neighborhood, but, next time we'll be staying elsewhere.","Los Angeles, California","dnb310</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",5,2.0

Side note: I read some of the reviews regarding the elevators. 1. We never had to wait. 2. It is very common in NYC to have to go down to get in an elevator to go to the rooftop bar. It is partly how they manage the crowds. ","Waukesha, Wisconsin","Momof2onherown</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waukesha, Wisconsin</strong>",2,5.0

My first was 4 years ago, and I remember before that seeing the hotel being built from the ground up. The hotel has some age spots and lost lustre, but is still a good choice for SoHo lodging. The location is hard to beat--at the southwest corner of SoHo, easily walkable to all the shops, restaurants and lounges in SoHo and Tribeca as well. Plus the Canal St. subway stops for the A,C,E and 1 lines are a block away. The A train links you with the AirTrain from JFK airport, while the A,C and E trains go to Penn Station, where you can link with NY Transit and the AirTrain to Newark airport.Even though I'd stayed here before, the lower level floors were still a bit confusing. The entrance lobby has a desk that seemed unstaffed, although there is a doorman and sometimes a bellman. The glass elevator takes you to the Sky Lobby where the reception desk is, a lovely space overlooking the hotel's urban garden and seasonal outdoor restaurant. A separate bank of 2 elevators extends from the urban garden level to the Sky Lobby up to the rooms and the rooftop pool and lounge. Stairs must be taken to access the entrance level from these elevators, although they do go down to the partially subterranean restaurant (David Burke Kitchen) level. The outdoor urban garden itself has multiple levels. Reception desk service was friendly but sometimes bumbling. I checked in early before a room was ready, but the receptionist ran out of luggage tags and it took quite awhile for the bellman to bring more. And when I got my room keys later in the day, the key to the luggage storage room could not be found, and it took another while for the luggage to be delivered to the room. And of course the front desk never called me to tell me the room was ready, even though they had my mobile number. This stay was booked via a non-opaque, pay-in-advance, non-refundable flash sale on a favourite website of mine. The reservation was for the hotel's least expensive room, a queen. I knew from past experience that one is never upgraded on bookings from this website, so I got my designated room on the 5th floor. The majority of the James' rooms face west looking towards the Hudson River, but some, including mine, face east onto SoHo, with glimpses of the East River bridges from higher floors such as the 17th floor fitness centre or the rooftop pool.The room was perfectly fine, compact but not cramped, full of light from the full wall of windows (a James' highlight). Lighting was great at night also. There was a built-in settee with storage drawers beneath it, a small round table/desk and a chair. The minibar and fridge were well-stocked. Rather that offer plastic bottled water, the James offers filtered water in refillable glass bottles. The bathroom had a full window looking into the bedroom with a shade for privacy if desired. The shower had rain and hand-held fixtures and pump dispensers for shampoo, conditioner and bath gel (loved the fragrance). I liked the zori-style terrycloth slippers. The A/C was super effective during my hot and humid stay. Niggles: no electrical outlets by the bed, no luggage rack and no alarm clock. For my previous stay, I was in one of the one-bedroom apartments. It was of course more spacious (only the penthouse suite is larger), but this queen room was no less comfortable. Although it was waived for my pre-paid booking, there is usually a $40 per night Hotel Facility Fee, noted on the hotel's website. Although some of the things included with the fee are things one would expect/hope to be complimentary (WiFi, concierge services, fitness centre access, newspapers, in-room coffee/tea), there were some additional features such as a $10 daily minibar credit (kind of tricky to gauge cost because there was no minibar menu with prices), 10% restaurant discount, welcome cocktail in the restaurant, morning coffee/tea/scones, early evening wine, evening cookies. The rooftop pool is really a pool-ette but does offer wonderful views west, south and east. It's seasonal, of course, but opens early for guests. There is pool-side meditation and yoga on Thursdays. The pool also closes early-ish in the afternoon, when the pool deck becomes part of lounge Jimmy. Guests have access to Jimmy until later in the evening, when there is a roped entrance from the street. The service elevator becomes Jimmy's elevator. I was surprised that Jimmy was still so popular, given its age and non-remodeled decor, but this was perhaps because I stayed over the July 4 week. I should add if you are over 30 years old, Jimmy may not be for you; look instead for a bingo game at a nearby senior citizen's centre.More popular than Jimmy is the seaonal pop-up Tulum-inspired Mexican restaurant/bar Gitano across the street from the James on a vacant lot. Since my visit, it was closed temporarily by the Health Department for violations including bathroom and potable water issues.I've always wanted to try the James' outdoor Garden at David Burke restaurant, but it was just too hot and humid for me this visit. The space is lovely, however, with ample foliage and situated above sidewalk level so passersby can't stare at you and the traffic heading towards the Holland Tunnel is not seen, although possible heard. Although I've eaten at David Burke Kitchen in the past, I skipped it this time. For late post-theatre food, I went more than once to the bodega on the corner of Grand and Thompson next to the hotel, which offers made-to-order hot food plus prepared cold foods and groceries. They actually have 2 stores across Thompson from each other. After my stay here at the James, I transferred to the Beekman Hotel near City Hall. The Beekman trumps the James for service, but the James' location is preferred. Design/decor are vastly different, renovated/old vs. contemporary--I loved them both, and would stay again at both.",Los Angeles CA,"pillowsofwanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles CA</strong>",1202,4.0

Our room was cute and petit and clean, and the staff really nice. Just two thing to know about the hotel, first you can't swim in the pool after 4:00PM which was disappointing after a day out and about. The roof top turns into a loud hip bar in the evening but I would have preferred to swim. Also the restaurant next although very cute was terrible. We ate there on the the 4th of July because we were afraid most other eateries would be closed. The food is VERY overpriced, service was the pits, the water made us feel he was doing us a favor by waiting on us, I think he had 2 tables? the place was so empty. The menu was boring and the food was only O.K so I don't recommend it at all.

The facility itself has many things going for it: good location, nice facility, some great views, especially looking west towards the Hudson. David Burke Kitchen gets high marks for food. The service however can be bad -- our reservations were badly handled not once but twice. To its credit, the hotel removed some expenses and sent us a bottle of wine so nice gestures. The fundamental problem -- mirroring some others I saw online -- is that the hotel now seems to revolve around the rooftop bar and pool, off limits a good bit of time to hotel guests. Additionally, as others have noted, there is a steady stream of 20ish partygoers wandering through the hotel, it felt like a college dorm.

It is modern and attractive and everything was clean. There is a $40 a day 'facilities fee'. From what we understand this allows you coffee in the morning, wine at a wine hour in the evening and access to the rooftop pool - however as others have mentioned this is only specifically for hotel guests during very limited daytime hours and the crowds and queues really put us off. I have seen mentioned online by the hotel that this facilities fee offers a discount and a drink at the restaurant but we were certainly not told about this - nor were we told about the fee until we were presented with the bill which was particularly galling as we had not used any of the 'facilities' it covered. Perhaps it may be worth mentioning this fee on check in.Doormen were great, reception staff were hopeless and bordering on rude.The room was lovely and absolutely spotless, although you could hear other guests in the corridors very easily. Why on earth anyone would want an unfrosted glass wall between the toilet and bed is beyond me, and we do wish the blind we kept putting down had been left that way.It was fine as a mid range hotel, but it certainly bills itself as something better than that. It would have been good value if not for the unexpected facilities fee for facilities we didn't use. We certainly wouldn't return.","London, United Kingdom","clg240</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",14,3.0

The room was large for ny hotels and plenty of draw space and a wardrobe. Bathroom was large with rainfall shower.

I found the elevators ok and did not have to wait long. The area is great and it takes about 10 mins to walk to BROADWAY with all the amazing shops - try to walk thru prince street.

I am basing my experience of this hotel for a 2-night stay during the festive Fourth of July period (wed-thurs night). The main attraction that got me to book this hotel was it's rooftop swimming pool, which I thought would be a great place to enjoy the Forth of July! It turns out that hotel guests, like me, who pay close to $400 per night plus an additional $45 pool access fee, are actually only able to use the pool for a short,limited time period during the day. Unfortunately, I only learned about this policy at the time of check-in that the situation arises because the rooftop pool opens up to the public, and the rooftop becomes an arguably ‘Wild’ party scene, complete with a DJ, full-bar at 5pm on weekdays! On the Forth of July, the pool closed to guests at 2pm, just after my check-in to make arrangements for the Big 4th of July bash complete with a DJ etc.... As a guest, I was actually precluded from even getting to the rooftop during the party because the party was filled to capacity by 6pm. more worrying is that I observed numerous folks roaming the halls and stairways over the course of the early and late evening, making my guest experience in this hotel feel absolutely unnerving. Further, the elevator wait times at any time of day or night are remarkably slow, which may be due in part to the hoards of public who are waiting to get to the rooftop. On my last day, the pool was actually closed to all hotel guests, due to 'weather', which included light rain sprinkles. It's understandable to shut the pool down if there were thunder storms, but the kind of weather that I observed, was a very light rain. Fortunately, I was able to leave this hotel before my trip ended and found myself enjoying an absolutely glamorous 5-Star hotel with privacy, elegance and class. I have never stayed in 5-star hotels that expose their guests to the kind of nonsense that hotel guest must endure at the James! I rounded down to one point because I would give the hotel a half of a star because the lovely manager graciously removed one of the $45 daily fees once realizing that my experience fell below expectations.","Santa Monica, California","WillinLa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Monica, California</strong>",34,1.0

We had a minor issue with our car key falling into the tiniest crevice in the lobby and disappearing into a bottomless abyss. Things happen in life. It’s how you deal with them that matters. And Kenny dealt with it by immediately getting all staff on high alert. Managers, maintenance, engineers... crowbars, drills, power saws. He immediately called in all resources from the hotel to the 5 boroughs and rescued our keys from the bowels of a black hole so deep I thought we might find the Ninja Turtles. He makes you feel like you’re the most important guest in the hotel, whether you are or not. He executes all requests immediately and with discretion when necessary. He will make it happen and if he can’t, he will get you the person can. In short, this hotel should be on your Soho shortlist. And Kenny deserves a raise. He may be a magician...

The rooms are beautifully designed with large windows, hard wood floors and structural concrete columns that all form a cohesive aesthetic. And the location is fantastic, convenient to SoHo and the trains. But it feels like the hotel has not had the attention to details warranted. From the start of the booking process, we ran into little oddities and neglects. The phone reservation service did not know the hotel offered family suites, despite listing them on the website (she asked me to read the website to her). I ended up having to book regular rooms and call the front desk to modify the reservation. Once we arrived, the rooms were nice, but many details were amiss; the HVAC panel in the closet was open, the corner king had one curtain sealed closed, defeating the benefit of a corner room; the shelf holding the hot water was loose (it was missing a peg); there were stains on the curtains; etc. None of these were big problems, but these did not live up to the promises of the hotel. Finally, the concierge and bellhop were frequently away from the desk. On multiple occasions we waited a while, to no avail. Overall, the location is nice, but the hotel feels a bit neglected and underwhelming.","Somerville, Massachusetts","Nathan P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Somerville, Massachusetts</strong>",3,3.0

Yes, the view was breathtaking and it was a well-decorated room in terms of the interior design but that is the only positive element that I experienced in my stay. My biggest complaint about the penthouse is that it had so many technical problems. The main toilet room near the showers had a door that would not close and the lights did not even work. In addition, the speaker system also did not work, and when I asked the hotel staff for help they just simply said ""it did not work"" and made no attempt to alleviate the issue or suggest any alternative solutions. In addition, the space was not that clean -- the sofa was dusty and the ""leather"" chair was full of wrinkles and was almost tearing at the seams. The floor was also not particularly clean either. The complimentary wine was a nice touch, but that is expected given that it is around ~$1,500 per night. I am profoundly disappointed to have spent such a large amount for a special occasion that was largely ruined by technical failures and poor condition of the space -- not to mention the other inherent problems of the hotel (such as slow elevators and loudness of the rooftop bar) that I have not even explored in this review. I guess the final straw was when I expressed these issues at check-out, the receptionist just simply acknowledged the problem nonchalantly and said that she would get it ""checked-out"" with no offer for any remedy whatsoever. I would have expected a far comprehensive customer service given the claim that the hotel is ""up-scale"" and commanded such a large premium accordingly. I would not say don't stay at the hotel, but I would definitely say avoid the penthouse at all costs (you can get the view at the bar) and be aware of some insufficiencies in the customer service department.","Saratoga, California","Daniel E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saratoga, California</strong>",7,1.0

Not that there's anything wrong with that but if you like 250 millennial's partying day and night on the rooftop bar (which is nice BTW) this is place for you.2. The crazy influx of partiers makes the elevators take forever. The hotel is oddly laid out so that the lobby is up a level which means you take 2 elevators to your room or stairs. Either is just a bad design. 3. Rooms are small and have an odd wax on them. So bad that I was falling everything, so no socks or trouble. They moved me to another room, a little better not much.4. Gym and internet are ok, not great. 5. Location is good - next to canal station which takes you up town quick. Also, always great to be in SOHO and close to Tribeca. 6.

The doorman stood at his desk, and just gave an eyebrow raise from his cell phone. No ""welcome""...no nothing. We had to figure out our way up to the next floor lobby. Here there was a very luke warm smile, with a forced ""hello"" from the one person standing at the desk. It was a pleasant surprise to see our room was ready upon arrival. We made our way up to the 6th floor King Corner room. It was a decent room with a decent view. Nothing more, nothing less. The room had quite a bit of dust accumulated on the night stands on each side of the bed, as well as the baseboards throughout. It just never felt ""clean"" We had to request extra towels as there were only two, and an extra robe as there was only one. Ordered room service for coffee two mornings. One morning it never came, so I had to call and request a pot. It was promptly brought up with two plastic high ball glasses. Maybe they ran out of proper coffee cups? It was 9am. The next day they only sent hot chocolate. A call quickly fixed the situation though, and they did not charge us for the coffee. The ""Jimmy"" bar upstairs had a great view and vibe, but would not let you order a drink to bring back to room. If you wanted ice in your room, you had to call guest services and get it by special request.Overall it was an underwhelming experience.

However, returning for New Years it was a different story. I had a multiple night stay which would end New Year's Day. They did not clean our room on time once this entire stay. I would leave for hours to come back around 6-8 pm with my room still disheveled, no refilled waters, no new towels. They didn't have our room on file when we went to check in and check in took 30 minutes+ because of that, their response was a flaw in their new booking system (I get it things happen). Our keys kept getting deactivated which meant I had to get it reactiviated multiple times through my stay when the key was in my wallet so it's not like my phone deactivated it. After all of this I took the step to speak to the manager and he said he would take care of it. He removed one night off our bill for our stay and gave a $50 drink ticket for the rooftop which made me think changes would be made and I truly thought that was kind of him. But not at all nothing changed. Once again the very next day they still didn't clean the room when we had the clean the room sign out there. He claimed after my frustration for this going on the entire stay that ""maybe I shouldn't have a room here."" That sounds like luxurious service to me having a manager speak that way to someone staying at this facility. I am displeased by this whole experience at The James Hotel. Their subpar service and bad managerial skills made a place that I once enjoyed a place I will never give my money to again.

The $75.00 payment should have allowed us to check in at 11:00 am. Despite my due diligence, when we arrived at around 12:30 pm (cancelled flight caused a delay coming in), the front desk (same person who I exchanged e-mails with) had no record of my request and the room was not ready yet. This was a disappointing start, even though the hotel ended up not charging me for early check-in. The room was ready a few hours later. Although I had requested a higher floor when I booked the room, we were given a room on the 4th floor and told they were fully booked. Another request that was not fulfilled.Although the room itself was clean and well appointed, it was not in the condition that I would expect from a 5-star hotel. The faucet in the shower came right off and the button to activate the rain shower head did not work. We had to use the shower handle instead. It is not acceptable that a hotel of The James' caliber should exhibit such a poor level of maintenance.The lobby is very tiny with a small sitting area and very basic amenities. The complimentary coffee was not refilled promptly in the mornings and the staff seemed to not want to be bothered to do so. The same went for the nightly wine and cheese. Despite showing up in the lobby only 30 minutes after the wine service began, there was no food left and it was not refilled until much later. Again, the staff seemed standoffish and not interested in going out of their way to deliver 5-star service.Finally, upon checkout, early Sunday morning, there was no staff to be found in the front and I had to go looking for them in a back room to check out, only to be told by the staff (who didn't even leave the back room to greet us or thank us for staying) that we didn't need to do anything to check out.The high notes: the location is very good and easily accessible by car service, taxi and train stations nearby. Also, the Jimmy (rooftop bar) was a lot of fun, with great views of the city, excellent music with live DJ and good drinks (be prepared to pay around $20/drink). There is also a great little market (Soho's Finest) right beside the hotel entrance which had great Panini sandwiches, snacks, drinks, water bottles, fresh salads, desserts and much more!Overall, we were a little disappointed in The James and would probably opt to stay at a different hotel in the area on our next visit to the great city of New York.","Ottawa, Canada","Mony M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",44,3.0

This hotel is a modern, boutique hotel in Soho. Initially after booking on line I had to call the hotel and make an adjustment to my reservation that I couldn’t rectify online. I spoke with Johnathan, a front desk manager, and he kindly made the correction, as well as arranged for an upgraded room when I told him it was our 25th Anniversary and that we were coming in from Long Island for a few days to celebrate rather than go out of town. We had a lovely corner king room, with a large bathroom, well laid out and spacious by nyc standards. After entering returning to our room the first evening, we were surprised by a bottle of Proseco and chocolate covered strawberries with a lovely card from The James, wishing us a happiness on the special occasion. Just a classy, unexpected gesture. The front desk/ guest services staff was helpful throughout our stay. We enjoyed the complimentary cheese and crackers and wine in the lobby in the evening, and the delicious scones and coffee in the morning. The outdoor seating area was very pretty as well, although we didn’t spend time there this trip due to the colder weather. The hotel is within walking distance to many good restaurants including Little Italy, and to the World Trade Center area as well. The only negatives I can offer are that I wasn’t crazy about how close we were situated to the sights and sounds of the Holland tunnel traffic. And that there was an erroneous room charge from the JIMMY hotel bar on our bill at checkout. All in all, I’d gladly return.

The bath amenities included quality natural products with wonderful scents. They also have the larger in-shower formats for shampoo/conditioner, which means less plastic polluting our oceans.The service, from the valet welcome at street level, to the reception lobby, to room service is friendly and professional. The hotel pays a lot of attention to design details, is careful of the environment and serves early morning coffee in the lobby with fresh scones.

It would be so easy to offer a choice of 3 toppings.However, what really impressed me is the staff.

I was not greeted upon checkin, I was given zero information whatsoever and they basically barely spoke to me. I won’t go into the fact that I also had billing issues that I caught and had to call about without a return call from the manager I was promised.

We arrived very early our first day, many hours before our check in time. Exhausted from our flight in the day before, the team was very helpful in rushing a room for us and allowing us to check in earlier so we can sleep. The rooms themselves exceeded my expectations with room,size, comfort, views, and amenities. Located in a great part of town with great options for food and shopping. They were very helpful in checking our bags before check in and after check out since our flight was later in the day. On our way out, they offered us a car service instead of us taking an uber to the airport. We accepted and our driver was awesome and knew the side roads and shortcuts, seeing as it was raining and the highway was packed bumper to bumper, we made our flight. The rooftop pool and bar is awesome and their pool parties are something to check out. Located near canal st. Station, it was very easy to get anywhere using the subways.

All the staff were very friendly and the bars are lively and buzzy. The room was pretty small, but it had all we needed. Now the bad. The hotel charges a resort fee on top of what you have already paid. It's thirty dollars per day plus tax and is not negotiable. They do this so they can advertise a lower rate and also pay a lower tax to the city. This fee includes wifi, tea and coffee, some drinks and pool access. We stayed for seven days and the pool was unavailable for three days. Therefore we refused to pay the resort fee for these days and to be fair the hotel did take these off the overall bill. If the hotel had simply included these fees in the price, we would have not quibbled at all. The fact is that it's a bit of an underhand means of extracting more money from you as a guest, as well as them saving a small amount of tax. Shame really, as this review would been higher otherwise. Lastly for some inexplicable reason, the hotel treated our double room as a single occupancy. Consequently we had one glass, one dressing gown, one towel, etc. We complained about this twice but it was never rectified.

However, the overall experience was mixed. First of all we discovered when we arrived (and it was in the small print on our Expedia booking form) that we were going to be charged a compulsory US$30 per night plus TAX 'Resort Fee'. When we asked what this was for - we were told it was for the tea and coffee in reception (which we never used), the 2 x free drinks vouchers each upon arrival and the use of the pool (which was off limits to us for 3 days out of 7 due to private functions - to be fair they did credit us 2 x $30 back for this inconvenience). The rooftop bar Jimmys is a great pull for the hotel and was a fun place to hang out. However, no priority is given in the lifts for guests and twice over the weekend (between 7-9pm) we had to take the stairs from our 7th floor room to get to ground level as the lifts were full of young partygoers to Jimmys. The rooms themselves are tiny. The floors were quite dusty and I'd give it a 7/10 for cleanliness. We made the mistake half way through our visit to leave all our change on the table - which was taken as a tip by the cleaner (she did leave us a nice note though).Overall the location of this hotel was a winner and the staff were friendly.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","SarahJane11London</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",99,3.0

We had 2 rooms, a deluxe for my wife and I and a standard for ours sons (22&20). The rooms were smallish but nice and the beds very comfortable. The boys room was on a corner of the hotel with double aspect windows giving a great view. The bathrooms are separated by glass and have a vanity blind you can shut when necessary. Unfortunately our blind was broken and had been taken away. We spoke to the hotel about this and they offered to move us, we declined as we had already unpacked and after 7 previous hotels on the trip were getting fed up of packing an re-packing. I did suggest to the hotel that they could have avoided putting anyone in this room until it had been fixed!The hotel offers complimentary coffee & croissants in the morning and wine in the evening for a limited time - but not worth getting excited about.They have a roof top bar and pool which sounds great except that the pool shuts very early or is booked out for private functions!! The rooftop bar attracts a lot of young hip people which means the lifts are very slow and often full of non-residents which was a bit annoying, especially the rude, presumably drunk ones.The hotel location is excellent for touring around Manhattan.The Wifi was a bit 'iffy' - fairly low speed (considering in New York) and often unobtainable on mobile.","Kent, England","Mark P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kent, England</strong>",89,4.0

I was on work for 6 days in the city with a colleague who also stayed at the hotel, we had heard good things about the James. Unfortunately my expectations were missed. I guess its all about what you want out of your trip to NYC. For a person in NYC for work, this hotel misses the mark big time for me. Pros- good room, size is small but in NYC or London i think this is perfectly fine. Light - good linen, nice min-bar, and standing shower, a big plus for the downtown hotels.- nice ground floor bar/ garden terrrace - good staff here, very friendly, attentive and the food is good. (in honesty would have preferred to hang at the pool after 8hrs of meetings hitting the streets, but we'll get onto that later.- West Soho location is decent - quick to the west side promenade for running, and into tribeca for good restos. - fast wifi in roomsCons-Noise - If you are on one fo the top 2 floors (my colleague) - you can hear the gym in your bedroom. and at night - the Pool party musci is clearly audible... so dont request a top floor room. Try not to get a low floo, i had one facing 6th/Canal - it is very noisy from traffic, put the fan on high to mute the noise and that worked. THe hotel in fairness has done its best to doubel glaze the windows.The POOL - now i knew the James did Pool parties, i didnt know they did them EVERY NIGHT. Fine my fault for not checking, but I dont know if they're even in control of this are or have sub-letted it out to an operator, but guests enjoyment and consideration aren't the key stroke here, its about sellign alot of alcohol to people from other hotels. I get the whole vibe on a weekend - no ones working and guests can use the hotel pool till 2pm.. i can accept that, hey even throw in Friday i get it - its NYC and party time, But for people who work and come back at 4pm.. to find the pool is closed monday - Thursday from 4pm.. especially in sumer, it just sucks... you've been in meetings all day, it's 30 degrees outside, and all you want to do is grab a beer and sit by the pool, and you get told its closed to get ready for the pool party, so that people not staying in the hotel can come and have a party. And on Thursday it only opens at 9am... The reason i mentioned the staff at the terrace and wonder if the hotel runs the pool operation, the staff at the pool are terrible at anything, just getting a water seems an uphill task. Way more interested in their card game inside at the bar.... i mean seriously NYC city of service delivery... Way below par for this standard of hotel.- Room service - took over 90mins for my breakfast to arrive, so just left without eating it. - Check in - area.. ummmm the portable desk.. Staff at check in were great.- Front doorman - was sometimes there - sometimes he wasn't.... He was very interested in his mobile phone when he was there, and saw multiple guests hacking with their bags, while he just sat idly by. - If here for work... no work desk, there is small table in an odd place in room but it doesnt work well. As with my title its all about expectaions - if you're here to be out and party it up at that pool as party destiantion - chose this hotel. If you're travelling for work, or base to explore and chill for 5 days in the city this is not the place for you... doubt i'll return.","Durban, South Africa","Journeyman-Saffa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Durban, South Africa</strong>",28,2.0

Each day we were greeted by the site of The Freedom Tower - which at night lit up & was a humble reminder of how amazing and vibrant NYC is. On our first day, we were looked after by several wonderful staff - who seemed very proud to work for the hotel. Nothing was too much trouble throughout our stay. One of the most lovely little touches was the complimentary cheese and biscuits along with red wine, served in the lobby early each evening. This was a welcomed treat, especially after a long day of walking around the city. It also enabled us to have a reason to casually chat with other hotel guests & because of this we met some amazing people. The James also takes their love of art very seriously. This apparent on entry, when you are met by the most unique stairwell wall, created with pieces of a keyboard. All of the original artwork throughout the hotel is stunning, and there is always something to look at.

She attempted to find so many ways to make sure if there might of been a mistake or under a different name , she offered me a seat in the lobby and a choice of coffee , water or a glass of wine , due to how tired and frustrated I was that was just perfect for me.

SUCKS!It took an hour for me to get some ice. There was an evening where an event was taking place so I was advised if I ordered food it would be at least an HOUR AND A HALF! Clearly the priority is keeping the event space full rather than feeding paying guest, staying in the hotel with no way of cooking food! In the end. I ordered take out. For me if a hotel can't meet a basic human need for food. It shouldn't be charging nearly '$400 per night. Call me old fashioned. But a boy's gotta eat.

We lived in Manhattan for 40 years so we are not country bumpkins. Turns out with respect to the James Hotel Soho, we most certainly were! We don’t travel to NYC often, but when we do we like to splurge a little bit and stay in a suite on a high floor with City views. The James seemed to offer that-even had a rooftop bar-the Jimmy- a “contemporary interpretation of a classic pub with a 1970’s New York twist.” But here was our mistake-we didn’t read the asterisk in the Jimmy’s description on the website, but even then we could not have been prepared. This past Saturday-April 29th- was a beautiful spring day in NYC. At the Jimmy, starting at 3 PM and continuing to 2 AM, music from this supposed pub like atmosphere blasted though out the hotel-from the 18th floor rooftop down the elevator shaft to the lobby. This was no pub-it was Studio 54 redux- a famous NYC discoteque- replete with bouncers and an outdoor rope line.We were on the 16th floor in a very pleasant suite but there was no way we could remain in our hotel room. We sought out the manager and complained. He immediately recognized the legitimacy of our complaint and essentially told us there was not much he could do with respect to the noise as that the rooftop bar was a separate entity from the hotel. He offered a small room on the 5th floor which we had no choice but to accept. So not only was our peace and quiet disturbed on Saturday, but we lost the ambiance that our 16th floor room would have provided for our Sunday morning. This was a totally disastrous and wasted weekend at the James.The only thing I could imagine because most, if not all, of the “partygoers” were not hotel guests, is that corporate James is making a lot of money off the lease rental for the rooftop or shares in the receipt of revenue to allow the Jimmy to potentially disturb its guests on a beautiful day. So beware, and perhaps the James should state more clearly on its website the risk to their guest’s peace and quiet.","East Hampton, New York","WestieNewYork</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>East Hampton, New York</strong>",3,1.0

As such, it's also quite convenient to Tribeca. Lots of shops, restaurants, and bars. 2) Architecturally interesting building3) Large rooms by lower Manhattan standardsThe Meh: 1) Being on the edge of Soho, it's right near the entrance to the Holland tunnel and a less than gorgeous block. Some rooms look out onto a vacant lot bordered by the tunnel traffic. #notelegant2) The room looked a little worse for the wear-dents and dings on some of the fixtures etc.The Bad:1) The toiletries were of inferior quality. Despite being natural/organic/free of bad stuff, they were not premium. The shampoo was positively watery.2) They forgot to re-stock towels the second night so I literally had no towels (which I figured out post-shower). 3) Only one elevator was working leading to vertiginously long waits for the elevator. 4) The rooftop bar has a great view but the service was lacking and the crowd was frankly a little trashy.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","165juliah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",19,4.0

I choose the James for it's location & at my time of purchase it was so budget friendly (which was imperative to make AIRBNBing our house make sense). When booking, I requested a quiet room (I'm so sensitive to noise) upon check-in, I was nervous that my room (on the 8th floor, next to a high traffic street) would be too loud to sleep in. The front desk readily changed me to a much quieter room. The staff as a whole were wonderful. I believe it was Kenny that was working the bell desk when I checked in and he was so sweet - like a ray of sunshine. Then all others, from the front desk to housekeeping, all had a positive attitude and were eager to accommodate me. It's centrally located to SOHO and many subway lines which is an additional plus. Complimentary coffee & scones are provided in the lobby every morning (this though, is GREAT coffee and scones).Only complaint is, as someone who loves to work-out, the gym is small. But, most NY gyms are in horrible basements and this one is surrounded by windows, light & bright. If working out is your thing, I would recommend you be flexible.

We had been staying at the St. Regis annually for 13 years, which had become like a second home and family to us in NYC, and I was hesitant about what we might experience at a newer, boutique hotel. I was pleasantly surprised when greeted by the front desk gal following a long journey from India with a very welcome glass of a nice Pinot Noir, and delighted with our room which was spacious, comfortable, and with a fantastic view of the city. The following day was Thanksgiving when we had been invited to a private home for dinner, and were asked to bring a food dish. It was late in the evening when I arrived, and with few stores open, my options were limited to none. Johnny, the front desk manager who generously assisted me during my initial stay at the hotel, came to the rescue and offered to procure 2 desserts for us from David Burke Kitchen...which ended up to be the hit of the party! Throughout our stay, which Johnny extended twice for us, he went above and beyond to ensure that any and all of our needs were met. Not only was he hospitable, professional, and very helpful - he was also warm and personable, with a charming sense of humor.

Nothing I could do about the filth on the windows obscuring what used to be a great view. I made multiple trips down myself to get what we needed, and not only did the staff seem completely uninterested, but it was as though I was imposing on them by going down myself to fetch what should have been in the room. Jerome, the night manager, when I asked to speak with him, made up a story about having seen me check in yesterday and he knew the room wasn't delivered late. When I called him on it (we actually checked in today, he wasn't in the hotel), the fact that he had it completely wrong bothered him not one bit.

We had stayed at the James in Chicago and liked it but this stay in Soho was really disappointing. First, for a nightly rate somewhere between $400-500 this hotel needs to seriously up its game:The lobby is small and unimpressive and doesn't offer many of the standard amenities lesser hotels offer. For example, we never saw any evening wine and beer happy hour as they had promised. Despite being ""upgraded"" to a corner suite on the 17th floor (which we later learned that night was right below the bar where we listened to loud music pumping till early the next morning - something the staff didn't think to warn us about) the room did not feel luxurious in any way - we had to call and request extra blankets because we were too cold under a very thin duvet. Same deal with the towels - there was hardly any place for towels in the bathroom and no extra towels were provided. We also had to request extra pillows because there were only two on the bed, not really enough to lean back against the hard headboard. We requested late check out and were told different prices for the check out, then were called repeatedly the day of check out asking why we had not yet checked out. Our room keys stopped working so we just gave up and checked out early. Finally, I let the manager know upon checkout all the issues we experienced. He was nice and adjusted our bill a bit, but after promising to send us our bill via email, it never came. I called today twice to request a folio and still don't have it. Altogether, an unimpressive stay in a not particularly inspiring part of Soho with a hotel that's clearly not on its game.

This is my 5th visit to the James since 2013 - in fact I have not stayed at another hotel in NY SINCE 2013 - so I am VERY sad and disappointed to see it in this fashion. I booked a 3 night stay and am considering moving to another hotel even if I lose money after being here just a few hours.I am in a Corner King Suite 1008 - however, I have stayed in this room type EVERY single time I have visited and it has never been this small. The other rooms I have been in felt more like a small apartment than a hotel room. This one is more akin to the size of a standard room that just so happens to be on the corner of the building. I called immediately to change rooms upon a timely check-in and was told there was no other option than a lower floor with the same floor plan. This struck me as odd when 10 minutes earlier as I was checking in there were 3 options available - and the remaining option now was not even among those previously offered. Unfortunately, the size of the room is only one of the issues here.Not only is the room smaller than previous visits, but it's in poor shape and borderline dirty. For over $500 a night, I expect a clean room. The floors look as if they haven't been mopped or treated in a very long time - scuffs and dust everywhere. And it's not just the floors; there is dust everywhere - seriously, everywhere. Imagine going to the snack bar to find lint on the food and dust balls flying up as you picked up an item. Eww. The robes provided are of two completely different styles and frayed. It almost looks like they hung up a guests personal robe that was left behind; one looks that much different than the other. And, they are shrunken.I can say as a frequent traveler that prefers boutique hotels, especially THIS PARTICULAR hotel, I am not happy to write this review. I do not write reviews often as I am not always in a unique position to comment, but in this case I am familiar enough with this hotel to notice that it has gone down in terms of value and overall experience.If you want a great location: come to The James. If you want a rooftop bar that is cozy and romantic: come to The James. If you want a comfy bed and roomy bathroom: come to The James.

My daughter 'freaked out'. There was rust and broken tiles in the bathroom, and the cleaning was not what it use to be. Management could not care less......and said there were no other rooms......yet, when I checked on both their own website and Expedia, there were still rooms left.I have stayed at this hotel maybe 20 times, but never again.

King Guestroom #2. Corner KingBed: ComfortableBathroom: Good size, big walk in showerBath and body products: OkRestaurant: Indoor and garden (did not try).Facilities: Rooftop pool and bar, complimentary snacks/refreshment in lobby, small gymAfter having had two previous enjoyable stays at the James in Chicago thought it would be nice to try the New York hotel. Considering rooms are small in New York I was happy to see on their webpage King Guestrooms measured 29 sqm/315 sq.ft which became the final decision to choose the James. The location is perfect within easy reach of the nearby neighbourhoods and down-town area. I would not say building looks stunning from the outside but interior decor is sleek, modern and pleasant. The entrance to the hotel is small and insignificant. Nothing elegant in my opinion. There was no door man or bellboy so we had to carry the luggage ourselves. I was surprised about leaving entrance without surveillance since the reception is located one floor up. During our stay entrance was manned most of the time, but not continuously which from a security point of view I found worrying. The reception is tiny (two smaller desks in front of the elevators) but has an agreeable lobby area. Check-in procedures were easy but arriving at 2 pm room was not ready. Was told it would be ”a couple of minutes”. Decided to wait and have a drink at the nice garden terrace. Reception should call us when the room was available but as it turned out they never did. Fortunately little more than one hour later we went back to reception and room was ”just ready” (hmmm… heard that one before). 7th floor is in the middle of the hotel which was fine. The insulation was good both regarding windows and adjacent rooms. Nice light room with large windows. Modern style in white with dark brown wooden furnitures. Quite simple but nice. Good size bathroom with large walk in shower. However, the room does not measure 29 sqm, it was about 21-22 sqm/225-235 sq ft. I definitely felt deceived since this was a crucial point for choosing the James. The hotel was basically fully booked but front desk officer on duty said they had a larger ”Deluxe King Guestroom” on 11th floor. This room was identical (apart from layout was rotated). Front desk officer was surprised as he thought the deluxe room were larger but nevertheless the hotel had no larger King Guestrooms. Corner rooms were larger but they had no one available. I told him I felt cheated and I also sent a message to the general manager, Joseph Rauer, regarding the situation. Next day I was informed hotel should try to arrange something. In the morning, while we were walking in the lower east end, I was called by front desk officer on duty telling us to be ready to move into another room and in order to guarantee the room would be available we had to have our luggage packed immediately. So we took a cab back to the hotel, packed our stuff so we could move. But room was no ready in any case so we left our things to be moved by the hotel later. Next room on the same floor was a Corner King. Yes, definitely a larger room with fantastic light and views. However, even here the hotel’s website lies: the room is supposed to be 35 sqm/380 sq ft, but it is not more than about 27 sqm/290 sq ft. Furthermore, the previous room had two wardrobes and this only one. The bathroom was also slightly smaller. General manager, Joseph Rauer, sent me a reply the following day saying he was happy the hotel had managed to transfer us to ”a more suitable room in consideration of the length of your stay”. Not in consideration of what I actually had booked according to their website and booking confirmation? We were given no apology or explanation. Shortly before our departure I wrote him back with my comments (basically what is in this review) but have had no response to that. The hotel has got many great reviews and I can agree that this is not a bad hotel. The rooftop bar/terrace is brilliant. The staff is friendly. Filtered water replenished every evening in the room. Nice lounge area with complimentary refreshments throughout the day. Location is excellent. However I cannot get over the misleading information on their website about size of room. Furthermore, according to webpage they have complimentary car service for travel within select downtown areas but fail to state it only operates weekdays. They do not have any real concierge service either. We asked front desk to book a table for lunch at a restaurant. They never called back to give us an answer. Complimentary coffee in the room is nice, but why only 1 regular and 1 decaf? No extra glasses in minibar, only the two in the bathroom. When rooftop bar is open there can be a long waiting time for the elevators. The facilities in the fitness room must be serviced. Most of the machine did not work properly and some not at all. Finally must mention, to my surprise, how quickly the hotel has become visibly worn considering it was built 2010.I was close to book the James Miami but with this experience, the inadequate answer and failure to respond from the managing director have made me loose faith in the James hotels. They have lost me as a client.","Stockholm, Sweden","Peter L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",162,3.0

If you don't want to climb stairs, you'll need to take two different elevators to get to your room.

Additionally, the room was a mess - there were several stains on the floor, there was dust everywhere, and the curtains were threadbare. When I called the front desk to request a different room, I encountered an extremely hostile manager - who demanded that he be let into my room immediately so I could assess the damage. My partner was arriving at the hotel and required valet parking so we could go to a meeting on time. The road was blocked but the hotel refused to send a valet half a block away to retrieve the car. After 30 minutes, they finally dispatched someone, promising me that they would comp parking. When I checked out, the front desk attendant said that she would need to validate the comped parking with a manager and would call me before I was charged. Needless to say, I was stunned when I received no call but saw the charge on my credit card bill. The facilities are disgusting, the staff are rude, and their ethics are questionable.

We live in the city so I can't speak to how convenient the location is for those coming in to the city for the first time- seems it would be a bit of a hassle getting there from LaGuardia or JFK, and it's not located close to any Midtown attractions (a good thing, in my opinion). It is walking distance from plenty of shopping, restaurants, and bars, and is a good option for those who want to explore Soho. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon and checked out at 2 pm the following day and could not have had a better experience. Everyone, from the front desk to the concierge to the man who delivered our room service, was friendly and beyond helpful.We were upgraded to a suite for no extra charge and it was a generous amount of space for NYC. The wood floors were pretty scuffed up, but otherwise the room was clean and attractive, with solid amenities including a comprehensive minibar (with full liquor bottles), a bathroom with separate soaking tub and rainfall shower, two iHome docks (one was an older model, the other had Bluetooth capabilities and a USB plug), and two flat-screen TVs. No in-room coffee makers (coffee is served daily in the lobby), but we did have an electric kettle. We had a corner room on the 15th floor that afforded incredible views from the bedroom and living space. We ordered room service from David Burke Kitchen at a strange mid-afternoon time and the food arrived quickly. Pricey, but gratuity was included (which we personally agree with), portions were generous (particularly for NYC), and everything was delicious. We later requested ice and two different people brought buckets. Just truly great service. The man who brought our room service saw us later in the elevator and made a point to say hello and ask us about our stay.We did check out the rooftop bar around 6:30 pm (it opens to the public at 9 pm) and although the views from the rooftop deck were incredible, the indoor space was pretty tight and the outdoor space was chilly in the offseason. The pool looked more aesthetically pleasing than functional, as it was pretty small and shallow.I definitely recommend spending extra for a higher floor with a view. Our room had blackout blinds and we didn't hear a peep all night. Hit up the bodega next to the hotel and save money on the minibar. Also worth it to check out some of the incredible food delivery options in the neighborhood. Front desk was able to recommend a solid lunch option in the neighborhood, and late 2 pm check out was AMAZING.","New York City, New York","Madeline O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,5.0

The Soho location was perfect with easy access to shopping and dining. In the spare time we had, we were able to relax in the gorgeous outdoor garden. The garden was bursting with greenery, which makes you forget that you are in downtown Manhattan. Our room was clean, modern and had the most fantastic review of the Freedom tower. It almost made me not want to leave! Also, kudos for having organic, chemical-free soap and lotion in the bathroom! The staff was helpful and courteous. Everyone we came into contact with greeted us with a smile. John and both of the Rebeccas at the front desk were super helpful and checked me in to the hotel in a timely fashion. Ecker, one of the managers, was very friendly and gave us helpful information about the hotel amenities.

My search criteria's were an outside pool, last of the summer sun, thought we could catch up on the Jet Lag by the pool Thursday afternoon. Concierge Lounge, because of the time difference on arrival wanted to be able to get small refreshments during the day to help get us onto Easter Time. Trendy Bar, this hotel advertised a bar on roof terrace beside outside pool. Club, being 50+ we wanted someone to carry on our celebrations after a fab dinner in New York this hotel offered Jimmy's a nightclub open throughout the night.The James ticked all the above boxes and after several calls to the hotel to confirm that the Pool would be open on our dates, (booked hotel with outside pool at Easter in Barcelona and when we arrived it was not open), that the club was open on a Thursday night. That the room was capable of taking 3 adults. That the James lounge was opened all day (have been to hotels where they advertise a club lounge but it only opens for couple of hours a day) etc etc Upon arrival at the Hotel our room was not available, this was not a surprise or a disappointment because we got to the hotel at 12.45 for a 2 check in. While we were waiting I asked if we could go to the outdoor pool to sit in the afternoon sun, this is when we found out that the pool closed on Labour Day. My problem with this information was the fact that the staff seemed to miss believe that I had been told that it would be open. (discussed this during 2 phone calls, not 1). they really did look at me as if I was making it up!! After sitting for another 10 mins in complete dis belief of our pool information (80 degrees outside) I asked if we could go to the concierge lounge (James Club) to get some soft drinks snack etc while we were waiting, we were then told we were sitting in it, the seats in reception of hotel! and that there was fruit and water further down the reception area, I told them I was led to believe that it was an all day lounge supplying refreshments. The timetable was 11 to 6 fruit and water, 5 to 6 a cookie, 6 to 7 wine. and that was it, not my idea of a concierge at a hotel.While we were sitting there other people arrived at the desk asking for the pool etc and the pool bar and were told the same information, then 4 young guys asked about the club and I found out by eavesdropping that the bar on the roof and club only stays open if there are sufficient numbers to keep it open, I understood by the way she said it that it would not be open after 11pm that evening, promised on calls that this would be a 2/3am finish.The way the staff dealt with the whole situation was even more disappointing than the hotel.We left the hotel there and then with our cases with no where to go in New York.

Since this was my first visit to NYC, I was apprehensive. Get to the point, I didn't know how to get to the gig in NJ and back. Fortunately, Morgan, the hotel's concierge, happens to be a Springsteen fan. He gave me all the helpful advice I needed. When I needed to travel to DC for the next Springsteen gig, he planned the trip for me, trying to make the journey as quick and cheap as possible. He even searched for a US Open ticket for me. Good seat at cheaper price than those found on reseller's sites. Furthermore, when I mentioned I needed to buy a present for my girlfriend, he suggested just the right shop. Thanks to Morgan, my stay at the James was memorable. I am most impressed and never think of stay anywhere else when I next visit.I should also mention that an American Breakfast I had at the hotel is the best ever. Again, the service was wonderful.

Myself and my wife were in New York for a long weekend and chose The James as my wife wished to be in SOHO near to shops restaurants etc. the hotel rooms were fine - that is why I gave two stars. However the hotel has a very busy bar on the top floor of the hotel and for the majority of the stay there were queues to get the lift to our room. this was further compounded by one of the two lifts being out of action for the sat and sun which meant there had to be a bouncer in the downstairs lobby trying to manage guests and visitors. In fairness he did his best to let guests in first but the result for us was that we avoided the hotel for the most part over the weekend because of the ordeal of getting to and from our room. if you want to use this hotel where you will be out most of the time and only come back to sleep - fine.if you want to use this hotel for a base to run to museums and shops and restaurants, popping back in numerous times over day to relax and drop off bags etc - avoid. as i said to girl at check out when they realised there was only one lift working for the weekend they should have made a decision whether it was worth opening a large rooftop bar to the public- severly compromising guests. they declined to comment and said they were sorry i felt that way. other positives were the doormen were v nice and helpful and the hotel was clean. but having to queue for lifts and share lifts with drunk people going to and from room is not something that we would expect - especially given the price point of this hotel. in all there are better hotels and if you want to experience the james - go to the bar. otherwise stay anywhere else",,Stephen B,2,2.0

The hotel has a modern feel with exposed concrete, clean lines and new fixtures and furnishings. Although it is not as nice as the Gramercy Park Hotel or other properties it is still quite good. As far as whether the decoration is too your liking you can see some of the attached pictures. As for the advantages and disadvantages, here goes:1. The large windows and views even from the 6th floor were good. The walls are thick and there was no noticeable noise from other rooms or the street below. 2. The rainfall shower and bathroom are quite good. 3. The size of the room is about average for a hotel in NY. The shower and bathroom is in a glassed off area rather than in a separate room. 4. The service is friendly and efficient with very prompt delivery for in-room dining. Breakfast was delicious. 5. The restaurant on site David Burke kitchen was also quite good. 6. The rooftop and terrace are terrific. The (very few) less good parts...1. The layout of the hotel is a bit confusing and takes some getting used to, with different levels and elevators to navigate around. 2. Bluetooth-enabled speaker and alarm wasn't particularly user friendly or up to the standards of the rest of the hotel. 3. The conditioner bottle in the shower was empty and needed to be refilled. The shampoo and conditioner is labeled and advertised as ""gluten free"" which seemed a little interesting and yet it must appeal to some. That's it.

For a hotel that appears to have high aspirations, it lets itself down in many areas. Firstly we found the majority of staff were not very friendly and didn't go out of their way to help. The main issue is the rooftop pool bar, Jimmy. It gets packed at night with a younger crowd that come in off the street, and the rooftop pool closes in the afternoon to accommodate this. The bar is often four deep and you'll have to wait up to 20 minutes to try and get a drink at night, from a rude bar tender. There is no priority for hotel guests and the whole rooftop pool area is poorly managed. Even the pool boy took his shirt off, sat in the pool and didn't help any of the guest. If you are going here for the pool area and pool bar, beware. One day we were notified (only by a sign in the elevator), that the pool would be closed that day due to a private function! I was told that the pool bar is under separate ownership and the hotel has no control of it. The James markets itself on the rooftop bar and pool, which lets down the whole experience.","Brisbane, Australia","JPBrisbane</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",12,3.0

My husband and I took an anniversary trip to New York City over Memorial Day weekend, and chose to stay at The James Hotel. The stay itself was fine, but what happened after was absolutely not acceptable. We were charged for over one hundred dollars of minibar expenses, when we never took anything. We didn't touch the minibar, it's just something we never, ever do. I found the charge on my credit card a few weeks after our stay, and spoke to several people at the James, constantly getting a different answer. It went from ""our mistake, it will be credited back"", to accusations from the food and beverage manager, ""I was personally in your room and saw that the alcohol was gone, and that there were drinks in the room"" (there wasn't, only our water glasses). I eventually had to call my credit card company and report them for fraud, which finally worked out in my favor, but the entire process took two months, several hours, many calls, and much frustration. It's too bad as we would have considered staying with them again, but after this debacle we will stay far away. I warn visitors of this hotel to make sure they get all receipts while checking out, and confirm that they are not getting fraudulently charged. We have never had anything like this happen to us before, and we are very disappointed in how the hotel management handled it.","Somerville, Massachusetts","angifli</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Somerville, Massachusetts</strong>",7,1.0

My friends are I are local in New York but decided on a staycation for my roommate's birthday. We booked a room at the last minute for the pool (given the fact that the other hotel pools in the area seemed to get too crowded or have too many people on any given day) and we were not disappointed. From the moment I walked in I felt like I was at home. The staff treated us extremely well, upgrading our room based on sheer availability and kindness. Upon checkin, we were offered a glass of wine, and then given recommendations about what we should do that night (we did end up having a few drinks at the Jimmy). Being a local, it's amazing when the place you're staying and the staff make you feel like you're actually on vacation. None of the staff had any qualms that we were local and in fact went out of their way to make sure our stay was the best it could be. When we went up to the pool the next morning, we were happily surprised when the front desk staff told us we could check out and still stay by the pool until it closed. I then randomly happened to meet the General Manager and the Director of Front Office Operations and even though they clearly had work to do and were busy, they stopped not only to talk to me, but to ensure that we were having a great time, making sure we were comfortable by the pool and even making the joke of taking away my cell phone to ensure we stayed stress-free!

Second time to New York and staying in Soho gives a real taste of New York in comparison to Midtown. We had stayed at the James in Miami and were really impressed so thought this would be a good choice. Good points: close to subway, great neighbourhood for shops, restaurants and bars all within walking distance. Doormen were so friendly and helpful, I didn't get their names but they do a great job welcoming people to the hotel and deserve credit for this. Rooms are very stylish great decor as is all of the hotel. Stayed in a king superior which was spacious enough for us. Bed very comfy, we asked for the memory foam pillows which were much more supportive. A/C worked brilliantly and was a relief from the 30+ degree heat. View from the room was fabulous, although I wish we had paid more for the corner king to get an even better view. Free coffee in the morning and wine/cheese in the evening but pastries had all gone when we got to the lobby at 9am one morning. Showers are lovely and spacious. It was my partners birthday and I had asked if there was anything they could do as a surprise, a young guy at the front desk (I didn't get his name) arranged for a very tasty chocolate cake to be left in the room whilst we were out which was a really nice touch so thank you for that! The same guy was also helpful at check in and gave us tips for places to go for drinks. The hotel is hip and stylish and a great place to be. A few negatives from our point of view: I found the room to be quite noisy late at night with other guests on the same floor closing doors and being generally noisy whilst waiting for lifts and also music from the rooftop but wasn't enough to keep us awake. Nothing major in terms of the room but in a hotel of this standard I wouldn't expect to have milk sachets not replaced or washcloths replaced for 2 days, it just felt that attention to detail was lacking - holes in towels, dressing gowns with loop holes detached etc. Lastly, the rooftop was one of the main reasons we booked this hotel. The opening times and areas reserved are made clear, however it generally felt that the public/private parties are prioritised over hotel guests, which I found surprising. It is clearly a very popular spot for parties/events which is hardly surprising as the views are amazing day or night. No one said anything in particular which was rude or offensive but there was just a general vibe that felt unwelcoming as guests. On our last day we wanted to see the view in the morning so headed up just to take some photos around 9am, it was quiet, there was a member of staff walking around and a couple of people sat/stood around drinking coffee. I had suggested to my partner that we get a drink to enjoy the view, despite the member of staff not being welcoming. There was some coffee/pastries on the bar just like what is provided downstairs...he poured himself a drink and was just about to offer me one when a woman who was stood around said ""actually they are for a photo shoot that is happening this morning""...it felt like somehow we had done something wrong despite there being no sign that this was not for hotel guests and the member of staff had not informed us that there was an event happening. We apologised to the woman and she said it was OK but it should have been pointed out to us beforehand. We just wanted to relax and enjoy the views but every time we visited the rooftop it felt somehow uninviting in atmosphere. In the evening it was very busy as I would have expected though and there was a long wait for the bar. Also there is a different lift to get up to the bar after a certain time so you can't just go up from your room floor. I would suggest if the rooftop is a place you want to visit, you would be better trying to make reservations not as a hotel guest. Overall the James was a great experience and we loved New York!

We had booked a corner studio online. When I arrived at reception to check in I was told that there was some good news and some bad news. The good news was that my wife and I had been upgraded to the Penthouse ! The bad news was that the room wasn't ready. I would take bad news like that every day of the week ! We located our relatives and went off for some afternoon food and drinks. When we returned our bags had already been brought up to our room. We all went up to the Penthouse for a look. Spectacular !! is all I can say. I have been in some nice hotel rooms before but never one like this. It was like a luxury Manhattan apartment. That said I can only provide a review of this room. I'm sure the other rooms are really nice too. The Hotel also has a rooftop pool which is kind of on the small side and might be a little uncomfortable to swim in when the bar is open which is also on the roof. The bar could use a little more help when it gets crowded as it took some time to get drinks later in the evening. When we were up there in the afternoon around 5 there was no issue. We all went back to the penthouse where we sat in the lounge, had some champagne, ( Provided by my other sister in law ) took in the great view and talked till 3 in the morning.

We had heard The James was a nice option...unfortunately we aren't super impressed at all. We had a nice check-in experience as we arrived early and our bags were stored so we could explore a little. As we booked 2 nights, on 2 different sites (cheaper that way), he graciously let us know that we would not have to change rooms and that he'd go ahead and check us in for both nights and bookings. That's about as good as our experience got. When we got back to the hotel after dinner, we checked with reception to get our room keys. We were told our bags had already been taken up...Great! But of course, they weren't. Whatever, no biggie, they came soon enough. The room is fine, nothing spectacular, especially for the price point. Dried urine on the toilet seat, but it wasn't worth the hassle of changing rooms so we just cleaned it ourselves, but come on...it's not like it was a dirty sock under the bed...It's the TOILET SEAT. As most rooftop bar/pools are, the evenings belong to the public (and at least they notify you of this in the elevator signs), and we had a nice enough time on a beautiful night overlooking the financial district, terrific views- best part of the hotel by far. Here's where they get annoying...we headed out this morning for a little food and shopping before it got too hot out. Left at 10:30am, returned at 2pm, looking forward to a relaxing afternoon on the roof at the pool with an overpriced NYC drink. Room keys don't work, back to reception. Sorry, we thought you checked out, so we need to check you back in. So we go through the whole check-in process again (didn't he tell me I wouldn't have to go through this?...whatever, maybe I misunderstood him/or vice versa. At least they let us stay in the same room. Get back to the room and it was still not cleaned up. Not the end of the world but we left the Housekeeping sign up so we could have a fresh room to return to, and if they thought we were leaving wouldn't that have been done first thing to turn the room? Quick change in the room and up to the rooftop pool, our plan for the afternoon and the main reason we booked here (for the pool). SORRY FOOL, we close (remove the lounge chairs) the pool to the guests at 2pm to let the public in at 3. What? Did the public pay $300-500+ a night to sit at the pool? So here I sit, as they take the lounge chairs up and re-arrange for the public...You know, none of this is the worst experience ever, but at the very least they should let you know that when you come in for a weekend in the city, you can't use the amenities all the time. Have signs posted, put it visibly accessible for us, mention it on the website. I mean, it's the first picture that usually pops up when you're advertising the hotel. Let people know that you have to wake up and go straight to the pool if you want to use it. Small nice features if this type of thing impresses you is some lackluster free wine and cheese each evening and some terrific coffee and okay pastries each morning.That's it...If you want a nice alternative, try the SixtySoho or Sixty LES. Also Hotel Hugo was terrific, as was Dream in Meatpacking. Too many choices in the city to return here.

The ""standard"" room was indeed standard in term of size, but very stylishly fitted out with dark stained wooden floors, white crisp linens and a sumptiously dark tiled bathroom with a massive ceiling shower. Only small irritation was the sideboard being set up like a fully stocked corner shop with sweets, chocolates, crisps, popcorn, beer, booze, softdrinks etc. but we were able to quickly shove all the goods on sale into one of the cupboard to give us some more space and for the room not to feel cluttered. The small pool on the rooftop was a peaceful retreat and gave a welcome rest and cooling down from walking around in 30C. However, from 3pm they open the pool to the public and it then immediately turns from blissful resting place to frantic party hangout. It was great fun later in the evening, and the DJ was very good.Breakfast dowstairs in the David Burke Kitchen was delicious -loved the very berry waffles!

It is located in the south east corner of Soho, a quiet street but yet not far from cafés and shopping. The entrance looks like any ordinary apartment building, with the reception situated on the first floor. You don’t pass any lounge, restaurant or bar on the way to your room, so all along I had the feeling I was renting an apartment rather than staying in a hotel. The bar on the rooftop was not accessible when I stayed in the hotel, some closed events toke place, and apparently that happens a lot. Not a worry for me, but if you are looking for more social space and personal service this is not the place. The gym on the top floor was small but well equipped. Had a scare when I enjoyed the view, slightly leaning on to the window, and it suddenly swung open... I reported it so I am sure they fixed it.There is a restaurant connected to the hotel, but I found my favorite breakfast place 4o meters away: Sanctuary T.

I would absolutely stay here again as I loved it, but I want to let people know that the rooftop while insanely cool is almost always booked for private parties. This was a big disappointment for us as it was the primary reason we booked this hotel. There is zero chill in regard to the elevator situation or being considered a guest when it comes to the rooftop. The guy with an earphone on the deck acts like an air traffic controller and tells you that if you are a hotel guest you must stay in a small unattractive area that has no bar service. He kept saying ""I have 2 private parties coming of 150! - you need to move!"" This was Saturday evening at about 5:15PM (the rooftop opens at 5) and it was wide open. He said ""come back another night."" Honestly he was over the top it in his rudeness/dismissiveness, but I understand management needs to make the changes. Many other nights it was posted in the elevator ""private party start tonight on the rooftop at 8PM"". In general, while this rooftop is the coolest thing going in SoHo (and arguably some of the best views in NYC), why spend all of the money to stay at The James if they treat you like you don't belong there.

It was already night and it's impossible to purchase it anywhere. It was very stressful. We complained that night as well as the next morning when we were checking out. The crew apologized but did nothing to remedy it. After getting back home I realized that I lost my laptop charger in my room. So I called the hotel to ask them to mail it to me. The manager I was speaking to was very nice. I mentioned the incident of my mother-in-law to him and he offered to refund some money for the trouble.Would be happy if things were smooth since then! Well, long story short, it took nearly two weeks for me to finally get my charger and the refund, after I called four or five times to the hotel in increasing frustration. Every time it was a different person, who would tell me my charger was on the way, but then apparently it would get lost in a black hole in the hotel. I would have just bought a new one had I known! Oh in between I did receive a charger from the hotel....an apple watch charger, although I clearly said mine was macbook pro charger.Anyway in the end I did receive the charger and the refund so it was all fine. Will probably stay again if I need to be in this area of New York.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Jing L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",47,4.0

We wanted to be in NYC in order to enjoy the museums, shows, restaurants etc., but we also wanted to have reasonable access to Brooklyn. The James Hotel worked very well for us.We stayed for a week and had a corner room (6th floor) with picture windows across two adjacent walls. The view of The Freedom Tower was wonderful. The king bed was extremely comfortable (not too firm) and the linens were of high quality. There were bedside reading lights on both sides of the bed. Most importantly, there was a power strip on my side of the bed so I could charge several devices simultaneously.There is a small stocked refrigerator that had space to put a few items of our own. There is a small round table with one wire frame chair. In addition, there is a five foot bench which served as seating and storage below.Storage was limited to the bedside tables, bench 2-drawer storage, shelving that is 5-6 feet above the ground. This made it difficult for me to reach the shelves since I'm 5'3"". There is a closet with several hangers, ironing board and iron. When I called the front desk to inquire about storage, they provided us with two luggage racks which enabled me to have access to the contents.The bathroom is quite roomy (roughly 6' x 6-1/2' plus a generous sized shower. The rain style shower head and sprayer are very nice quality. The towels, including bath sheets, are Turkish cotton and are of high quality. There is ample counter space to place bathroom items. The 5' shelf is roughly 5"" deep. The hairdryer, unfortunately, is the type of Conair that runs very hot. It does, however, get the job done. The curious shade in the bathroom which covers the glass wall does a nice job of ensuring privacy.I was impressed with the quality of housekeeping, front desk assistance and technical help. A light bulb burned out and was replaced within ten minutes. A neighbor arrived at their room, which was adjacent to ours, at 2 AM and began laughing and talking very loudly outside our door. I called the front desk and they immediately came up to speak to the revelers. The location is such that we never had trouble getting a cab. The only drawback is that we were quite a distance from the Met Museum. Wine and cheese is provided in the evening and later in the evening cookies are available. Breakfast fare is limited to a small scone and coffee.Across the street is a small shop entitled Thompson's Finest Deli (green menus on the outside walls) which has a great variety of snacks, including bagels with lox, breakfast sandwiches and of omelette so. The entire staff is very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend a stay at The James New York.","Oakland, California","Kathryn M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",1,4.0

Room was very nice, clean modern feel, comfortable size - we were on the 12th floor facing west which offered an excellent view, and was high enough off the street that it was fairly peaceful, for NY. The bed was fantastically comfortable, slept better than I had in months, and the towels were thick and soft. The rain shower head was cool but really needed the wand to get the suds out of your hair. Really big bathroom for New York standards - the glass wall with retractable blind was a nice modern touch, let in enough light but also provided for privacy. The James provides shampoo, soap and conditioner in bulk bottles. This used to bother me, but it really does make more sense and is much more ecological, so I'm good with it. The product, I can't remember the name, but it was nice. Had an inroom safe, and a generous minibar selection. Oh, the WiFi signal was strong on our floor. You just had to log in about once every 24 hours. There was a large bench seat and a small table and chair, in room that was great for setting out the suitcase. Closet had a lot of hangers. And it was really clean! Really, I couldn't ask for more in a room. My only complaint with the property was with the Treehouse bar. Kind of pricey (even for Soho) and lacking - BUT to be fair, I think it was just opening for the season so I'll cut them some slack. Of course Jimmy on the top provides the best views in a really amazing setting - if only we could get a seat and a drink, I'm sure we would have liked it better! But the lounge at the SoHo Grand next door was an excellent substitute. Finally the location was really perfect. SW corner of SoHo with several different subway stations within a 5 minute walk - and easy access to pretty much anything on the South end of Manhattan.","San Marcos, California","Chris C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Marcos, California</strong>",8,5.0

Rooms look a tad Spartan, a lot of glass, white lines and edges. The beds and pillows were very soft, which may or may not be to your liking. I called for several foam pillows and they helped. Rooms were clean. The corner rooms have great views of the Neighbourhood. The corner room was a good size for a Manhattan boutique hotel. Thankfully they have blackout curtains so you don't have to worry about bright lights from outside. There is some noise from the street but the hotel is in a relatively quiet end of soho so we were not affected by street noise at all. The entrance to the hotel is not on the same floor as the lobby. In order to get to your room you therefore have to take two different elevators. Troublesome especially if you have heavy bags (there wasn't anyone at the bell desk at the entrance when we arrived). For a smallish hotel the elevators saw a lot of traffic especially during the evening hours because of the rooftop bar upstairs. Prepare to squeeze into crowded lifts and to wait a few minutes to get one. There was a lot of noise in the hotel because of the traffic. Walls seem to be thin. We could hear the TV and conversations of the guest next door. Bumps from the room upstairs resonated very distinctly throughout the room. Do not book this hotel if you are expecting an oasis of calm. Canal street subway station is a few steps away. Hotel is also within walking distance of Soho shopping. Stands out as a design hotel, but like many of these, the James focuses more on its own aesthetic rather than the customer's holistic experience. Worthwhile checking the rooftop bar out for the views and to experience the hotel's design (half of New York seems to be doing so judging from the traffic).

John greeted us on the ground floor to take care of our car and send us up to the lobby. He also gave us great suggestions, and eventually brought our bags to the room when it was ready. We were early to check in, but the reception desk checked our bags and took my phone number so they could call us when the room was available. We left all superfluous items, and set out to sightsee. The neighborhood is excellent and convenient to many sights. You are near a metro that is only one stop from the 911 memorial. There are many shops, restaurants and pubs in the area, and the cool vibe of TriBeCa and SoHo. Reception gave us directons and we headed over toward the Highline park. It is a bit of a walk, but we were up for it. I am sure you could get a train there easily as well. Once we got to Meatpacking Dist. we had a quick bite before heading up to the Highline. We walked all the way to the end taking in the views and the people. While walking the hotel notified us that our room was ready whenever we made it back. We got a ride back to the hotel so we could get there quicker. We were greeted with news that they had been able to upgrade us to a King room, we had a corner room on the 9th floor which offered a lovely view of the buildings around us. They also let us know that there is complementary wine and cheese in the lobby for guests at 6, and that cookies are out from 8-11pm! We went to the room and got cleaned up and made a dinner reservation at a great restaurant around the corner. A great recommendation by Eric, who was Johns evening replacement. We walked the blocks around our hotel and found a great French Patisserie for 4 o'clock coffee and snack. We headed back to the hotel around 6 to change for dinner, we stopped for a glass of wine in the lobby, then changed and went up to the rooftop bar where we enjoyed a drink and a beautiful sunset over the river with a view of Hoboken.

The porter assisted me to the room and took my bags which i am happy about as this is their job and payment. I went into my room dialed into the call and worked however after ending my call i started looking around the room and noticed how loud it was, I was on level 3. Practically on the street level and my view was looking over a derelict area of 'Avenue of the Americas'. I tried to focus on my work but was constantly distracted by the outside noise. I then was walking around the room 'Corner studio' and stepped on a screw. as much as this was painful i was shocked that this would happen in a 'Luxury' Hotel. I immediately called down to reception to not only tell them about the noise after asking for a quiet room but also how I had just stepped on a screw and hurt my foot. After taking 20 minutes to call me back they had then agreed to move me to a higher floor and ensured me that this was a much nicer room. I moved to the 8th floor which admittedly was quieter but still does not warrant a Luxury Status. There was no apology from the hotel for the screw or for me stepping on this, no gesture of good will and certainly no acknowledgement that they had done wrong. My stay here was average and nothing special, I certainly did not like the area and I travel to NYC very often for work and pleasure. On departing i mentioned the screw incident and nothing was even spoken about. I asked to be sent my invoice on departing and was told there was nothing else to pay as the bill was paid before arriving.On my return to the UK, I asked the hotel for a breakdown of the stay as I noticed a charge on my credit card i didn't recognise, I had sent that email in December. I never received a reply, I chased this and only now in February had received a response. The email was DISMISSIVE, RUDE and UNHELPFUL. They reply was - to receive an invoice of your stay, you will need to request that from Expedia - that is it. Not answering my question or acknowledging the fact it has taken them 3 months to reply. After looking into this further I found out that they have the capability of finding this information out for me however they were too LAZY to do so, as a few emails later I received the invoice. After back and forth emails and much time spent on this issue along with frustration of not having received a reply sooner and the dismissive response i did receive, I was then promised a refund for 1 night stay. 2 days later they decided that this was not possible and they could not provide this but rather offer me an upgrade when I next stay here. This is unacceptable as I will not be staying in a hotel worthy of only 2 stars. This hotel did not suit my needs or expectations and was highly disappointed.To this day there was no acknowledgement of the screws being loose on the floor which I showed the hotel staff and they also turned the whole discussion of them not replying for 3 month around to blame this on me for not being able to offer me any compensation. Unacceptable customer service and very poor behaviour from the management.","London, United Kingdom","Ryan S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",10,1.0

My wife, children, and I came in for the night of 2/6 to celebrate my wife’s B-day as The James New York is one of her favorite places on earth. This is my fourth review of the James over the last several years and while staffing has changed from time to time, as it does in any hotel, I can tell you The James New York certainly has not lost the recipe for success over the years and consistency is so important in the hospitality business. Customer service from reservations and throughout our entire stay was and continues to be top shelf. Our rooms were immaculate and our stay was simply amazing. John and Jimmy are two of the best doormen in the industry and have become great friends. Jerome, the new front desk manager, is a true hospitality specialist and made us feel just like we were home. Johnny is great as well. At the front desk, Debbie was awesome and the two Jessica’s were so pleasant.The David Burke Kitchen was just as amazing as it always is and a great choice for my wife’s B-Day Dinner. Heather, the new restaurant manager, is an absolute great find for David Burke and our great friend Max, at the bar, always makes an awesome Honey Badger and is an exceptional person.

I don't know if it was other guests, or whether it was mechanical stuff in the building (scraping noises, thuds, etc.), but eventually I put in earplugs and finished the night up quietly. I also suggest not staying in a west-facing room if possible, because you hear a lot of honking traffic on the approach to the Holland Tunnel. I am sure a room facing east or north is preferable.

We didn't find out that the drain was clogged until shortly before check-out and I didn't want to stand in several inches of standing water in a hotel shower, so we had to spend a day of traveling feeling gross and dirty. I expect the bare minimum, such as a working shower, at this caliber of hotel...but okay, things happen. So then I made the mistake of thinking that we would experience some decent customer service since it's a big inconvenience to not be able to shower at any hotel, especially a ""nice"" hotel. We went down to talk to the front desk about the shower and they offered to comp our mini bar...too bad we didn't use the mini bar. So then they offered a free upgrade for our next visit (as if we would ever come back)!

Deb had already pulled my reservation up due to the short advance notice by the valet and so after I showed my ID I was off to my room. I had the corner studio which was 5 star. There was a bottle of fresh water from the tap (NYC has amazing tap water) that they claim is run thru a triple filtration system before being bottled for you. A full selection of snacks, wine, beer and top shelf liquor was available in my room (I didn't indulge because there were no price tags, haha - but it was nice that it was convenient if I had wanted to).

The lobby is modern and most rooms have an impressive view of the city. The staff is also very accommodating and friendly. Jerome is a lovely man. However, the hotel as a whole needs to step up its game. Basic details go unnoticed and there seems to be a pattern, based on other reviews. For my stay, we experienced TV's too dim to see (tried to adjust it; still nope!), TV remotes needing new batteries, bedside clock 6 hrs slow and cannot be adjusted (what?), toilet-paper holder that is loose on the wall and falls to floor when you rip paper from it, lamps that are loose and swing around when you pick them up, lack of general lighting, chipped furniture or room wood fixtures, bulbs out or missing, amenities like hand cream in bathroom missing, 1 bar of soap for the entire bathroom shower and tub (yes, we can ask for another, but that's not the point). I could go on.This hotel cost me close to $400 per night for a suite (totaling around $1,000 for a weekend stay). The room's view was amazing, but the lack of basic details made me feel like I was getting gypped. I wouldn't expect these types of basic silly issues at a Holiday Inn. So an expensive luxury hotel in Soho should absolutely never have them, ever. The James is not good enough. They haven't earned the right to charge $400/night because they keep low expectations of their guests. Just to further prove the widespread issue, we even switched suites to a new one and the 2nd room still had some or most of these issues listed above. Guests simply don't get enough for their money here and in a city like NYC, that lacks in hotels like Wall St does for money, there are so many other great hotels to choose from. This is not Richmond, Virginia where luxury choices may be slim.

I've stayed all over the city, and like Soho, so tried it. Upon arrival, I had to open the door with luggage until the concierge/doorman/ receptionist helped me. Upon check in there was a problem with room being ready on time. This was at 5:30 pm. Took another that was ready, and the room seemed nice for NYC standards. However, to say this is a boutique hotel is false. The toiletries were substandard, and the entire length of my stay(week) I had to ask daily for washcloths, water refills, coffee refills.What kind of hotel doesn't have washcloths?and how about buying some new ones that don't treat your skin as a cheese grater? Buy some new towels!!! In room coffee was instant, Instantly placing this establishment below three star chains that are a fraction of the price.employees were less than helpful at every turn. Normal hotel amenities were obsolete.was told upon check in there was coffee and pastries every morning. Maybe coffee, but hardened muffins hardly count as sustenance,when they were even present.One day out of 6! We went to check out the rooftop bar, but all the slovenly dressed,attitude stricken employees made you feel unwelcome, and the service was horrible. We eventually got up and left after waiting for server to return.room service was much of the same.food was good,but looked hastily thrown together, and the attitude of the girl in the paperboy hat was deplorable. Every single member of this staff seemed to be in a perpetual state of misery, and it showed. Poor service. I didn't encounter a manager at all,just some unhappy, poorly trained employees that seemed to have more important things to do, like act and look smug to those that pay their salaries.

The front desk was a little confused. initially they told us to it was too early to check in (we were there at around 2pm) and then told us there was an upgrade we could check into immediately. The door man still had our bags and a bottle of champagne that was suppose to be brought up. We decided to go up to the room and hang out for a bit before going out. We went out and came back to the room but someone was in it. We came down and told them someone was in the room. Initially the manager came out and apologized and was very nice. He kindly offered us a 150 dollar brunch certificate for the inconvenience. Our luggage and champagne weren't brought up so I figured they just never checked us in. Otherwise the room was nice, we spent the entire 150 on champagne in the brunch, no other problems. Also the door man was very nice and kept my car out in front and didn't end up charging us for parking. We never went to the roof deck, mostly because we didn't want to goto the front desk first to ask them to let us up there after 9pm (elevator won't let you just go up to the roof from your room).

The location is superb. My room choice is always a Corner Studio. I recognize Eric and other Staff year after year. They remain pleasant, courteous and prompt. Wi-Fi is strong and 2:00 check-in is appreciated. Unfortunately, there's a noticeable, steady decline in the attention to detail. The lobby furnishings were once tastefully modern and comfortable. They're now stained and saggy. Not an enjoyable space for a morning cup of coffee. A coffee maker is no longer available in the room, though there is an electric kettle to boil water for instant.Hotel guests compete with rooftop bar patrons for limited elevator space. Bar patrons trump hotel guests on the weekends. I don't anticipate that will ever change. Hotel guests are squeezed out of the relaxing pool area to get ready for the onslaught of locals and non-guests. It borders on insulting. I haven't been back up there since I was asked to move a few years ago. No problem with the room size. Expect small-ish. No noise issues. Plenty of hanging space and the bench drawers are ample. Lighting is fine with the exception of a couple burned out bulbs recently. The once comfortable mattress needs to be turned or replaced. The power strip next to the bed failed to charge my devices overnight. I checked to make sure it was plugged in and reset it but I ended up having to charge up in the bathroom outlet.The heated tile floor in the bathroom can't make-up for the dingy, frayed bathrobe and matching towels. Both were once fluffy and plush. I couldn't even bring myself to use the robe this time. The shower and sink drained at a frustratingly slow pace. The Intelligent Nutrient Harmonic bath products bolted to the shower wall are divine, but I miss having the body lotion ... any body lotion for that matter. You'll have to pack your own.The turndown service used to include fresh water and a sampling of Kee's Chocolates from around the corner as opposed to my most recent visit where there was simply a bucket of ice and half filled water carafe.I ordered a continental breakfast which arrived promptly. However, the coffee pot was missing the knob on the lid and the pastry was placed on a sweaty covered plate. No preserves or butter. A huge departure from previous stays when it arrived in a linen lined basket with a selection of preserves and softened butter ... and an undamaged coffee pot.For years I was greeted with a handwritten note welcoming me back for my 7th, 10th, etc. stay. The note was accompanied by a bottle of wine or fruit. It was a wonderful gesture and I felt choosing The James was money well spent. On this last visit, the only personal service was from Housekeeping. They left a note thanking me for the tip.The Staff does well with what they've been left to work with. The James isn't a huge hotel. What once set them apart from other hotels no longer exists. Being eco-friendly and a supporter of local artists and small business looks good in promotional material, but isn't enough to keep my business. I've rescinded the recommendation to friends to stay at The James and I'll begin looking for another hotel.","Phoenix, Arizona","mary k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",2,3.0

If people still had flip phones then everyone in that line would own one.Nice touches were the free wine and cheese in the lobby in the early evening that few people appeared to take advantage of but was appreciated before going out for the night.Only grumble would be the communication before the booking.

The experience exceeded our expectations starting with the room. We booked a corner king suite, and I asked for a quiet room on a high floor with great views. They put us in 1403, and it was all that we hoped for. Didn't hear a peep during the entire stay, and had amazing views of the Freedom Tower and downtown. The room was very clean, and well appointed, and the staff was very friendly.I can see how other reviewers talk about the noise (from the street or the elevator), and how it can be problematic, so I'm thankful I read the reviews before arriving, because our room was fantastic.If you look at the pictures on the site, it can feel like a bit of a fishbowl - but it's an excellent tradeoff for having windows on two sides of the room, and in our room, there was not a building that was really that close to be concerned with... and of course you have the privacy shades. It's essentially a non-issue.We went to the roof-top bar a couple of times. It wasn't our scene. We are laid back, and it was very trendy, very hip, very showy. The staff was nice - I think they could tell we were out of our element. So they were able to hook us up with drinks and we were on our way back to our room. It would be great if they had a ""hotel guest"" part of the bar aka people not into a scene part of the rooftop bar... it was a very cool bar setup, just not what we are in to.You are pretty close to the action in SoHo, so the location was good. We walked all over.We stayed at the Trump SoHo in a trip last year, which was also great. Because we were here as a couple versus a family, I prefer the James Hotel. If we were as a family, the Trump SoHo was probably more practical (and more expensive if I recall).The guys working the door/concierge/bell were all very cool... very friendly and helpful.

It's pricey, but then it seems all NY hotels are these days. The room was very nice for one person – small but perfectly formed. The only slight annoyances were that there were no drawers to store clothes and the bed was very soft. There was a kettle and instant coffee and tea bags, so it was nice to wake up and be able to make a cup of tea in the morning. After the second day though, the teabags weren't replaced so I had to call down for more every day, which was a bit of a pain. One day I had to call twice as they obviously forgot. Also, the turndown service didn't happen on my last night. My only other bugbear was the service in the rooftop bar, JIMMY. The bar is lovely, with a tiny pool and great views over Manhattan. But these time it took to get a drink meant that we ended up leaving without one the first time we tried, and the second time we went we had to stand at the bar for 20mins to get a drink (there's no table service). When you're paying $16 plus tip for the cheapest glass of wine that feels like a rip off despite the view.These points aside, I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel.

Room niggles, wood veneer was peeling off the closet and small table, no coffee making machine only a kettle with sachets of coffee/tea, no spoons only wooden sticks, knobs in the bathroom were wobbly and the shower door didn't shut properly so if you splashed around water escaped. Bizarrely, no drawers at all for clothes, the closet was small,ok for a short stay, there was a shelve at the top which if you are short, like me, you couldn't reach it. Sound proofing was an issue, the person/s occupying the room above could be heard clip clopping around.Having said all this the staff were very friendly, we had a nice meal at the Tree Top/Garden restaurant (?) but had a very inferior breakfast at David Burke …. one sullen waiter, one waiter who was completely clueless and didn't even know the name of the hotel to which D.B is affiliated.Didn't particularly like the location which is right at the bottom of Soho near the Holland Tunnel, but was nevertheless accessible for the shops/restaurants.I believe the hotel has only been open a few years and in some areas already looks a little tired.

We were indeed disappointed to say the least.The guest room we had was tiny even by NY standard, which I had intentionally tried to avoid by reserving the corner studio.

I appreciate the idea of elevating the lobby to above street level and avoid pedestrian traffic, but the lobby was again tiny and can get overcrowded easily, too.

The rooftop pool has a bar/lounge area where drinks and snacks are served. It is open for hotel guests only until 12 noon. After that, it is open to the public and gets a bit crowded. The pool is cold, but refreshing! From the rooftop you could see The World Trade Center and Empire State Building. There is a DJ playing music during the afternoon and night and the rooftop transforms into a classy nightclub in the evening that closes at 2am. This hotel is close to the subway and public transportation with easy access to many downtown attractions, including The World Trade Center, Brookfield Place, Wall Street, Battery Park, The Staten Island Ferry and The South Street Seaport.The staff was very friendly and accommodating.

The rooms were big and immaculate with great views. The bathrobes were really comfortable and the beds are like clouds. We took advantage of the free coffee, scones and newspapers in the lobby every morning,the cheese, wine and crackers at happy hour and cookies at night before bed. Everything was delicious!

It was such a nice touch. We didn't get to enjoy the hotels's complimentary wine and cheese in the evening as we had dinner reservations. The room was nice and dark and quite, perfect for a good night's sleep! The only downside to the room was the coffee making facilities.

We are New Yorkers but wanted a mini-getaway with a pool. Let's start with the pool. It is the smallest rooftop pool I have ever seen. I am not sure if it is heated at all, but the water is freezing. No one could even use it all morning because it was so cold. Until, that is, it fills up with 23 year olds once the pool opens to the public at 3pm. When it does, hang on! You'll be inundated by heavy drinking frat types and they are shoulder to shoulder. They lay on every inch of the ground and take over the entire pool. Forget keeping your beach lounge--they few that they have are 'reserved' for those who have made reservations and are getting bottle service--mostly non hotel guests who I doubt could afford to stay here. When we complained to the manager he was kind enough to give us a $50 certificate to David Burke's Kitchen, which is part of the hotel. We proceeded to have an absolutely terrible meal there--do not go for any reason! There are lots of better places nearby. Now for the hotel. it is old and badly designed. The glass elevator from the grimy lobby is dirty, as are the steel girders and walls on the way up. The rooms are small (typical for NYC, so no problem there). The carpets are stained in the hallways--yuck. They put out pastries and coffee in the morning but no one pays attention so they were out of milk for the coffee the two times we stopped by. When we asked for a bagel shop we were directed to a bodega that happens to sell bagels. Come on! I would hate for tourists looking for NYC bagels to get this piece of bad advice! All this for $500 a night. Ridiculous. Look elsewhere.","New York City, New York","kathkel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",59,2.0

As the hotel is in Soho with not a lot of other tall buildings around it offers fantasic views over the city or the Hudson river, depending on your room. The rooftop bar is also excellent. The rooms are quite small, but it's perfect for a couple. After our last visit in 2013 we loved the hotel so much that we decided to hold our wedding in the penthouse and were lucky enough to stay in it for one night. The penthouse is absolutely stunning with fantastic views over the city. A perfect location for an intimate wedding dinner and the staff couldn't have been more professional. We have never dined in the hotel resturant before, but they provided the food for the dinner and it was absolutely exceptional. Will highly recommend.

Beige is definitely their favorite color. Lobby is pretty small, but definitely come back in the morning for some complementary treats. Did not try the restaurant, gym or pool (if they have one).Rooms: The room we stayed in was very small (but probably on par with other NYC hotels). However it didn’t feel that small due to the HUGE windows in the room. Was a really nice touch having all that natural light pour in. The bed was extremely comfy, did not want to get out of it in the morning. We had a room that faced the “park” and it was very quiet, even though the street was below.

The only good thing was Kanye (sorry if I am misspelling his name), he did everything he could to make everything better! Oh, just one more thing: the manager opened another room for me to see if I wanted to move, but it was just the same mess. I thought after that he would ask to the housekeeping to give an extra care to our room, but it never happened. He offered some kind of vouchers to have dinner on the restaurant, but look, I'm complaining about the lack of cleanliness and how a restaurant voucher could ever compensate it?? Ok, maybe the 'dirtiness' is just another ""eco-friendly"" thing from their menu.","Lisbon, Portugal","nvanzo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lisbon, Portugal</strong>",38,1.0

Unfortunately, our experience left a lot to be desired. The pool apparently is managed by the rooftop bar the Jimmy and apparently they are under new management which explains the service issues. First of all, there was no drink/food service at all at the pool (we had to track multiple people down to figure out how to order room service up there) and the bar itself did not open until 1pm! Additionally, we were informed that at 2:45pm, that he lounge chairs would be turned into benches for the bar and we could not lay out any longer. I understand promoting the night club however there is no reason this turnover needs to happen so early in the afternoon and prevent paying guests from enjoying this amenity. The management tried to explain that the pool area has different management but that is no excuse. We were extremely upset as this was not disclosed to us at booking or at check-in and basically ruined half the day. Also,there was no music at the pool during the day and the pool was not heated and freezing.

We wanted to feel pampered and just relax. I found the James via my credit card points program and it was listed there as 5 star and most reviews looked good. But...we definitely picked the wrong hotel (my bad, should have done more research). I should have known things would not be up to our standards when I tried to call the hotel 3 times to get an early check in and not once did anyone pick up.I have many complaints but here are the top ones:1. Elevators take FOREVER. They reserve one elevator to go up to Jimmy's rooftop so the hotel guests are basically shorted an elevator. One ride up we noticed it smelled really bad, and another guest mentioned someone had puked in the elevator. So if you're in to that, I guess you'll like this hotel. Us, not so much. a few other guests seemed annoyed and complained that they'd never stay at the James again.2. The hotel is loud. You can hear the music pumping from the rooftop when you're in the hotel and when we tried to have a nice dinner outside, we had to ask to be moved because of the thumping music.3. The hotel itself is sort of dirty. Dirty hallway carpet, elevators, etcI kind of just got a weird vibe from the place overall. I actually told my husband I wanted to move hotels since we only had one night but he convinced me to stay. It was fine but I would not go back nor recommend it. The highlight of our stay was probably our server at David Burke Kitchen. He was awesome, made great recs and made sure we were attended to.

The service was fine, although a little impersonal and we were not given much information upon arrival. For example, we received two complimentary drinks when we booked - but we were never offered these at the hotel. The roof top bar is well decorated and the cocktails are great (have the Moscow Mule). The view is just stunning, and there is a heated pool if you fancy it. However, the vibe at the roof top bar was a bit odd. The waitresses were wearing very revealing outfits and heavy make-up in the afternoon (which may have been more suitable for the evening), giving the place a bit of a cheap vibe.

Also, the tray with the coffee maker was left out on the table which took up all the space on the table. Also, there was only one water drinking glass so one of us had to drink water out of a coffee mug.- At various nights, we were missing either a bath mat or washcloths- Housekeeping left two windows open so it was very cold when we got back to the room at night. (We had a corner room facing SE so it probably got very hot during the afternoon when housekeeping was in there.)- There was a strange item left on the bed after housekeeping. It was a long white plastic ""plank"" that ran the width of the bed by about 2 inches wide. We propped it up in the corner of the room. No idea what it could have been.- There were no luggage racks in the room...it doesn't feel good to put a suitcase with dirty wheels on top of pristine white bedcovers. There was a bench, but the location was not convenient relative to the closet and also there was a round table in front of it so we'd have to move the table.- One side of the bed had no outlet, the other side had a power strip on the bottom shelf of the nighttable. Not very convenient.- Also, to go outside required switching elevators. The lobby elevators either didn't go to the ground, or for the times when it did, stopped only at a ""mezzanine"" type area that required a short stair descent. It was mysterious to us when it would go to the mezzanine level or not. Swiping the key sometimes seemed to work, sometimes not. The alternative was to switch elevators in the lobby to the one elevator that does go all the way to the ground.Design -- hotel was very sunny and the design was pleasing to the eye, but the materials were probably not very high quality as things were a bit banged up and dingy.On the plus side the staff was very friendly, especially at the restaurant downstairs. We also thought the food there was quite good.

That said, there is much to like about this hotel. The restaurant downstairs is excellent, the Soho location is outstanding (although the Sixth Avenue side of the hotel is loud -- be sure to request a room on the other side if you're a light sleeper). The fitness center boasts remarkable views -- but only two carafes of water, which were empty by the end of my work-out on both days I was there. The hotel makes a point of providing filtered water to guests, but then doesn't re-fill the water during turn-down. It's almost as if they have the right ideas about how to be a top-rate boutique hotel, but just can't quite execute all of those ideas.

So, here is my greatest challenge - the place seems a little tired and just slightly tattered. I am assuming that many people stay here and it really shows. I can't really point at one glaring thing, but there were a lot of little things in my room that pointed to very very used - the toilet worked, but I always had to push the button twice, the rug at the end of the bed needed a thorough cleaning, the platform on which the mattress rested, was chipped, there was a strip of blue tape that painters use, in the crevice of the floor and baseboard. I know, I know, these all sound so petty when taken by themselves, but the overarching feeling was that the rooms aren't well taken care of, because they are moving so many people thru the system. Good for The James to have such great business, but I probably won't stay again - and if they don't have a regular maintenance program, I strongly suggest one. The public spaces felt the same way for me.

Bedding was very comfortable, and the pillows melted your cares away when you lay your head down. The amenity bar had an outstanding selection of temptations to choose from, and the free filtered water was a nice touch. The bathroom was spacious for NYC and the shower had both a waterfall and hand held shower head. The hairdryer was actually a real hair dryer that works well.We did go upstairs to the upstairs bar ""Jimmy"" and were met with a fantastic view of the city. Freedom Tower on one side and the Empire State on the other. There is a plunge pool and outside space that is best when the weather is warmer. The bar fills up on a Saturday night, but it was very enjoyable, good music, and the bartenders were very attentive. The rest of the staff were always helpful and very prompt to help if you asked them to assist. If you are staying in Soho, it is a great place to stay and convenient to exploring Soho, Little Italy, and Chinatown. I would definitely return.","Ambler, Pennsylvania","TheRays70</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ambler, Pennsylvania</strong>",21,5.0

First, I will say the greeting by John -door man- was very good he explained the room and details about the hotel etc. The young woman that checked us in offer to upgrade us to a suite- since we had the doggie and perhaps may want more room for our two night stay- at $300.00 extra per night, we declined. I mentioned a gratis bump to a slightly bigger room would definitely be welcome however it was promptly declined. Hard to believe the hotel being full on a subzero degree weekend, but understood. Our room was indeed small, fortunately for us we had booked a corner room which offered wall to wall windows. We visited Jimmy's roof top bar for after dinner drinks and overlooking the rude women attending the lounge we had a pleasant time, specially since it was snowing and we could not find a cab to go elsewhere. A ""shout out"" to the gentleman working as bouncer who help us get a sit - go figure, the bouncer was nicer than service staff- Bottom line, there's a lot of loose threads in this hotel, the likelihood of us staying here is small.

Stayed corner studio first 3 night's north/west facing and not south as requested however, rm 1008 did not disappoint. Exceptional bed, pillows and amenities but far too small for us. Upgraded to Penthouse 1601 with sweeping views to east, south and west. That is, morning sun looking out to Brooklyn Bridge, Freedom Tower south and the impressive Hudson River to east. Views are worth the money for the Penthouse except, the Penthouse came with many defects perhaps through neglect of maintenance and repairs and or, that the Penthouse generally gets booked out for corporate functions and photo shoots, either way, no excuse. The defects included but were not limited to, the smart house electrical system totally useless so no blinds working but who would want to close the blinds with such fabulous views? Leaking bath, one blocked sink, lights not working and left over food in fridge from who knows! The worst feature and one we were perplexed by as far as design goes, was the fact that the Gym's treadmill is directly above the Penthouse bedroom and a runners pounding vibrates through the whole apartment, a huge problem which should be addressed without delay.However, non of that stopped us as we spoke about our grievances with Juliette, Front desk and as she had assisted us to transition from corner studio to Penthouse, Juliette promptly with professional enthusiasm, sorted out and had fixed what she could and even ensured that the discount room rate was further reduced. In addition, we were told, if we wished to extend out stay, we could do so at the reduced rate. Bravo Juliette! for a relative newcomer to the James she turned our experience into something wonderful. Never sighted nor spoke to a Manager which did surprise us however, with staff like Juliette,Samara, Erica and the excellent door staff, we thank you and the James is very lucky indeed. We did extend our stay and loved it even with the pounding but if you are thinking of the Penthouse, it's not worth the published rate but it is well worth the 25% of the published rate. Importantly for this hotel, they did what you expect of a hotel when you have a problem, they addressed it and turned what could have been a nightmare experience into a fabulous one.The James is directly above David's Restaurant which is an added bonus plus in the city that never sleeps, Soho is full of diverse cafes. restaurants and bar's and of course shopping. And keep in mind the crowds, if you have experienced a Mac Store upon release of a new phone or computer well be ready because everywhere you go it just like that although Soho offers some reprieve.","Melbourne, Australia","Snugbob</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",1,4.0

I happily accepted her recommendation, as it’s next to impossible to choose from all the hotels in NY if you do not know the city, and I did not regret it a second!The James New York is what I guess is called a Designer Hotel, whatever that’s really supposed to tell you. I had a standard room. Spacious, nice furniture (with a sitting group, sofa, chair and table). I like my hotel rooms to have somewhere to sit down apart from the bed. A spacy bathroom, with a glass wall (you could drop a curtain if you preferred to do your business of take a shower without the rest of the party watching you. Nice bed and a breathtaking view out over New York, Soho / lower Manhattan.The staff was extraordinary pleasant and helpful, as seems to be the norm in New York.The James is quite expensive, as I understand most ok hotels in NY are. But you must be prepared to spend quite some money if you want to stay there, more than $ 500 a night.The only downsides I can think of was that the Jimmy bar at the top floor with the beautiful view was closed several evenings because of privat arrangements. In addition, I did not get used to the breakfast they served at the David Burke Kitchen in the basement. I like a Scandinavian or Continental Breakfast, but that was not to be had. But I guess this is an American thing. Give me the breakfast at the Sacher Hotel in Salzburg!

Our choice turned out to be a great one on all fronts -- service, rooms, location, and comfort. The James is perfectly located for our food & shopping-focused itinerary. We were able to walk to most of our target restaurants in the LES, Chinatown, and Little Italy, and SOHO. Of course, the bounty of SOHO shopping was at our doorstep.The hotel itself is very modern and beautifully appointed. Bell service is prompt and friendly on the ground floor, and you're quickly directed to the front desk on the 2nd level. We were a bit early for checkin, so they took our bags and we were off. We booked two rooms for (2 parents, 2 teens), and the hotel was nice enough to give us adjacent rooms (even though I forgot to request that!). The rooms were very nice, though definitely NYC-small -- great bathrooms, super-comfortable beds, and generous closet space with a safe. The views are excellent, even from our fairly low 9th floor perch. The bar on 15 is amazing -- a beautiful setting wrapped in 2-story glass with stunning NYC views. The service was outstanding, the vibe fun, and the setting was very chic. It was too cold to hang out by the pool, or on the outdoor patios on the 2nd floor (Christmas time), but those looked like great fun in warmer weather.Even when we hit a snag, the James shone. When we returned around 4pm on our first day to finally check-in, one room was ready and we were told the other would be ""ready in just a few minutes"". It took more than an hour to get into our 2nd room and to get our bags brought up, despite several requests. Finally the manager came up, apologized, and resolved everything -- we got into our room, got our bags, and he offered a very generous $150 credit to the restaurant. Upon checkout, we had not eaten in the restaurant but we had spent $120 in the bar and through room service. I asked at the front desk if I could use my restaurant credit against my $120, and they quickly said ""certainly"". They went above and beyond to resolve a fairly minor issue, and that attention to service and detail was very much appreciated!!! Job well done.I will definitely return to the James for our next Soho stay!!","Waltham, Massachusetts, United States","537toddc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waltham, Massachusetts, United States</strong>",13,5.0

We read the reviews and asked not to be on the 17th. However, because they put someone else in our assigned room, when we checked in we were offered a downgrade (for one night, and then having to change rooms) or the 17th floor. We were there from Thursday through Sunday and didn't want to change rooms, so we took the 17th (the bar/club is on 18). The noise on Friday and Saturday night was louder than I could have ever anticipated. I'm no stranger to noise - I've been to Burning Man many times so I'm used to being someplace where the music is going all night long. At Burning Man I might use earplugs, depending on the noise level, and that's all I've ever needed. The noise on Saturday night was so loud that I gave up on earplugs and used my Bose noise cancelling earbuds. While that reduced the noise somewhat, the base was so strong that my whole body was still thumping. In addition to the music, there's additional noise coming from the hallway. There's a small rooftop pool, and on 17 there's a door labeled pool maintenance. What the sign doesn't tell you is that there's also a dishwasher in there (and a fridge or two) and you're also going to hear people carrying racks of clean glasses past your door and up the stairs to the bar ( I wonder if the health department approves of pool chemicals stored with food and other such items). I complained to the hotel the next day and did get a reduction in my room rate, but they really should be charging 50% or less of the quoted rates if you're there on a Friday or Saturday night. If you're going to be out partying yourself until after 2am, then you won't hear a thing.

When we returned, we discovered a chilled bottle of Piper Heidsieck champagne and chocolate covered strawberries compliments of the staff!! True celebration! Our dinner at Kelly & Ping was amazing. The best duck we've ever had! We checked out the rooftop bar Jimmy's before going to bed. Jimmy's has beautiful views of the city - especially at night.

It is located near the mouth of the holland tunnel in SoHo, far, far away from the more touristy areas of the city. For its location, it is realitvley quiet. Lets be honest, there is no place in NYC that is completely noise free, but I was able to sleep without earplugs. Entering the hotel itself can be offputting because the main lobby is actually on the second level. The entrance itself is on the ground level. Upon checking in (if after 5 pm) go directly off to the right and you will be greeted with a free wine and cheese reception. This is a nice touch. The lobby's decor is amazing and styled in a modern organic look. Sort of like a country estate without the kitsch. The rooms are excellent. I stayed in a corner king, which had a great view. I think it is worth the extra $100 per night. The amenities are top notch. The minibar is actually a scaled down version of something you may have in your own home. There are 375ml bottles of liquor and minis as well. A cocktail strainer and muddler are part of the setup. Awesome bathroom with a real rain-shower. Beds are very comfortable and pillows are plush. The real hardwood floors are also a great touch. The best thing about the James is the service. One particular individual I would like to recognize is Eric the bellman. He was prompt, courteous, and quick to hail a cab. He went out of his way to make things convenient for us. The other guys were excellent as well. I dont think Ive seen a hotel crew in the last 2 years that runs as fast as them to get things done. One caveat is that I did not try any of the dining ventures at this facility nor did I try the gym. I did go to the rooftop bar Jimmy, and the views are spectacular. The bar itself was too packed with non guests to get a drink in a timely fashion, so I opted out. Plus they were serving drinks in plastic cups because they had run out of glassware! Please refer to other reviews of Jimmys on Yelp or TripAdvisor. It almost seemed as if the hotel staff (awesome) and Jimmy's staff (not so awesome) were two different groups of people in no way related to each other. I will definitely be back. The service and location cant be beat. There are a lot of ""boutique"" and ""luxury"" hotels that claim to have a singular experience only to fall short. The James is the real deal and I think for what I paid (a weekend splurge), I got my money's worth. The only thing I didnt really like was the pretentiousness of the rooftop bar-my suggestion would be to go very early in the evening before the non guests start crowding the bar. Otherwise, there are some very nice bars around Soho.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","cas560</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",8,5.0

An excellent location -- very close to all the cool shopping, fun bars, etc. in the Soho neighborhood. (We had brunch at The Dutch and dinner at Estela, both in walking distance of the hotel). The service and amenities were also great (we particularly enjoyed the coffee from Colombe and pasties from Balthazar both mornings and the cookies from David Burke every night). The room was beautiful. And the staff was attentive -- Eric, in particular, was super helpful in showing us around the hotel, bringing our bags to the room, providing neighborhood advice, etc.The hotel was really great and we'll be back. Just one complaint. Our only complaint concerned the elevators and Jimmy. The hotel is a bit of a maze. This was infuriating late on Friday night, when we got back to the hotel at about 11:30. We tried to check out Jimmy, the nightclub on the roof. Although we were in the lobby -- where the elevators can access the roof throughout most of the day -- we were told we had to go back outside (which is a hassle, because the hotel is a maze), walk around the block, show our IDs to a bouncer, etc., to get to the nightclub. When we left the nightclub later that night, neither of the elevator girls felt like working, so we had to wait for a bouncer to escort an elevator full of guests. And yet again, we couldn't access our floor from the elevator! An insane policy that doesn't put hotel guests first.

Upon checking in on Sunday I was told the pool was now closed as it was out of season but we could still sit around it !! Not sure what season it is open as it was 30 degrees and perfect pool weather!! Also could not get near the roof top as after 3pm it is open to the public as a uber cool bar with DJ. The next morning before checking out I thought I would catch some last minute sun but again could not access the roof top as it was privately booked out!! The whole reason people book this hotel is for the roof top pool and terrace but they seem to be more interested in getting the public up there than providing for the hotel residents. All in all very disappointing and felt the hotel is deliberately miss selling itself. On the plus the hotel is lovely with beautiful rooms.

It's on the third floor next to the cleaners closet which makes it noisy in the mornings. Perhaps the hotel is understaffed because the rooms don't get cleaned until late in the afternoon (to allow for check-ins I guess). Also although it's not advertised the hotels allows dogs. The afternoon free drinks in the lobby and biscuits for supper are often not available unless you are one of first guests there. After 5pm each day the rooftop bar is actually not run by the hotel and becomes an overcrowded noisy bar. And the restaurant is overpriced.

It was also disappointing to be told that the pool closed for summer 2 days after we checked it. We were advised this is state law, but not being locals it is not something we were aware of and the website does not advise this.

Flash sales and what not kept me from staying here until now, almost 5 years after its opening, although we have eaten at the restaurant David Burke Kitchen during several past Restaurant Weeks. I was immediately attracted by the hotel's design--a standard rectangular building with a curvy glass-walled lobby beneath it, and cleverly planned elevated urban garden beside it. It has become my Soho hotel of choice, besting stays at Trump, Mondrian and Mercer, although Crosby Street and the Broome are still on my radar (Soho Grand and SIXTY Soho never have been).For frugal-minded travelers like ourselves who don't mind shlepping their luggage on the AirTrain and subway from JFK airport, the James is very convenient from the Howard Beach AirTrain and A metro line, as the Canal St. exit is just behind the hotel. The street entrance on Grand has bowls of biscuits and water for dogs, and the bellman desk, which I noticed during my stay was not always staffed. Luckily, it was staffed when we arrived, and Kenny promptly escorted us to the glass elevator to the Sky Lobby, and later to the room. The hotel is chock-full of art, and 2 of the largest pieces, a gold-hued tapestry by textile atelier Hechizoo and a mosaic-like piece made entirely of scavenged computer keyboard keys by Sarah Frost are in the ground floor lobby. The hotel has a house car in the mornings and afternoons that goes downtown and as far north as 14th St.The reception desk in the Sky Lobby was a small counter just large enough for 2 staffers. The lobby itself, with its aforementioned curvy glass walls that overlook the Urban Garden, is furnished with unique modern pieces. I particularly liked the wooden benches with small terrariums embedded in them. Two computers and a printer are available for guests, and there is a small table that offers treats throughout the day: pastries and coffee/tea in the morning, fruit throughout the day, wine and cheese/crackers at happy hour, fresh baked cookies in the evening, filtered water all the time. When I booked online, I was given the opportunity to upgrade my room on a space-available basis for a reduced rate. I accepted the offer, and we found out at check-in that we had been upgraded from a Deluxe King (king room on a higher floor) to a One-Bedroom Apartment. There are four such rooms, all facing north (and east/west), one on top of the other, on floors 12, 14, 15, 16. The largest room, the Penthouse Loft, is on floor 16 and faces south (and east/west). The top floor, 17, has a few standard-sized rooms, plus the gym and mechanical room for the rooftop pool. Floor 17 supposedly gets a lot of noise from the rooftop bar, Jimmy.Our ""apartment"" on floor 12 was not set-up exactly like the photos on the hotel website, although the floor-plan was the same, extending the entire width of the hotel. There was a living room in one corner and a bedroom in the other, separated by a large marble bathroom. The living room held a large sofa, chair, table with 2 chairs, flat TV mounted on the structural concrete pillar in the corner, closet and expansive minibar, complete with accoutrements necessary for complete cocktail making--you just call room service for the necessary fixings. The bedroom held the king bed with a unique headboard (but not as unique as the wooden one on the website), a desk, another pillar-mounted TV, and a bench with storage below and a variety of packaged gifts items available for purchase (some at great cost) in a box. The bathroom had but one sink, a large dual-head shower, a separate tub, and a windowed wall into the bedroom with a unique privacy screen (designed by Nienke Sybrandy) that lowered with a switch. Lighting in the bathroom was great, but decidedly inadequate in the living and bedroom. The living room had but a single naked light bulb above the table, plus a dim light above the minibar. Housekeeping told me the bulb was supposed to be naked (it's shown as such on the website), but said other apartments have another light fixture above the sofa. Perhaps that is the fixture I found tucked behind the corner pillar, leaning against the window, inoperable. I discovered it when I heard a dripping noise on the wooden floor by the pillar during a rain ( I called the front desk, and the hotel's solution was to place 3 towels on the floor--ingenious!). The bedroom had a headboard that lit up 2 ways, plus reading lamps on both sides of the bed, but no lamp for the desk. The full walls of windows in both rooms afforded great views, but the curtains were difficult to close at night. Higher floor rooms probably get a glimpse of the Empire State Building to the north and the Hudson River to the west. Our housekeeper actually wrote thank you notes for the gratuity we left daily. Wifi is free.The James' Urban Garden and dining areas have a lovely design. The main restaurant, David Burke Kitchen, is partially underground, but still has windows near the ceiling for lots of light--you can see the feet and lower legs of passing pedestrians. A lot of the menu is available through room service. We dined here once again for Restaurant Week; it is consistently good, and somewhat unique in that pretty much the whole menu was available (some restaurants have a separate Restaurant Week menu).Above the restaurant is the Treehouse Bar, and the Garden at David Burke outdoor restaurant, part of the multilevel Urban Garden. We didn't get a chance to dine here, but did explore the garden-- full of seating areas, art, and foliage. Plus you are above the sidewalk level, so it's much more private. Beautiful.The rooftop holds the small pool and deck, and the Jimmy Bar and Lounge, which I think takes over the pool deck as well in the evening. The pool deck affords great views of Soho, the Freedom Tower, and a glimpse of the Hudson River, plus the Holland Tunnel entrance. Jimmy is rather small, and has a velvet rope in the evening. Hotel guests have a rope indoors next to the Urban Garden, while non-guests have a rope outside. There is a dedicated elevator to Jimmy at night.

A great group of people were dancing and the dj music was perfect. Kept wondering if someone was going to fall into the pool. Just out there in the middle of everything..haha. The drinks and food were good. Not outstanding but no complaints either.The hotel bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby. Close to shopping and eating in Soho.

Superb location in the heart of SoHo. Expected a bit more of the hotel itself. I know space is scarse in NYC, but our double room was extremely small. The bed was not even Queen size and therefore quite cramped for 2 people! Hardly any space to put suitcases so all our stuff was kind of all over the very tiny room so we had to tiptoe and jump over bags to get from bed into the bathroom. The latter was very nice and practical with a great walk-in rain shower. I particularly like the glass partition betweeb bathroom and sleeping area. Am also a big fan of hardwood floors in hotel rooms. Overall impression of corridors and rooms is that everything looked a bit tired already although the lobby and general areas where still very nice and modern. Check in staff : very impersonal. Worthwhile to check your bill at check out as mine had quite some considerable mistakes. Also we learnt upon check out we did not get all the relevant info regarding breakfast options upon check in. Our room rate included continental brkfst, but nobody told us we weren't supposed to have breakfast in the restaurant but in the lobby. Who would have known this ?! So we were charged for full breakfast - however this was rectified upon our departure, the point is that we should have gotten co'plete info upon arrival.The open air restaurant seemed lovely however very busy and unfortunately we could just have drinks. It took forever though before anyone noticed us ! Food looked great and would have loved to have dinner there.

My three day two night stay at The James New York in SOHO was outstanding. After arriving and having to deal with a nightmare with various representatives from Citibank after learning my bank card had been compromised, the staff at The James did whatever they could to make sure that I was taken care of. As I stood in the lobby stressed and frustrated and on the phone with multiple representatives from Citibank, the front desk manager provided me with water and a glass of wine, until I was able to get everything sorted out! After the debacle, I finally made my way up to my suite and was blown away the second I stepped foot into the room. The room was crisp, clean, contemporary, and have sweeping views of the beautiful NYC skyline - my second home! It was my first time seeing the Freedom Tower complete and shining in the distance. One of the former PR agency's I worked for actually did the PR for the architects/designers for the Freedom Tower so I was lucky enough to work some of the events including the groundbreaking. So again it meant a lot that this was the view I got to fall asleep and wake up to. The bed and linens were luxurious and I slept well. Room service was quick and service was extremely friendly. The bathroom was gorgeous and I loved the electronic shade that you had the option of pulling down for privacy or lifting up so you could see the room. I also enjoyed flipping through the book left in the room - 'Humans of New York' - and ended up buying a copy when I returned to DC to remind me how how amazing NYC - my second home is. The day I checked out, I was able to get a late check out and head up to the rooftop pool to enjoy a cocktail and a quick dip. I ordered lunch up there as well. It was the perfect way to end my trip!This hotel is also well known as a see and be seen property.

We were not disappointed. Kenny took great care of us at check-in. The front desk found us a room even though we arrived early. Throughout our stay the staff went out of their way to pamper us. As a frequent business traveller, this level of service is rarely found in the big chain hotels. Our room was a nice size with a great view of lower Manhattan. It is nice that the windows open slightly, Sometimes I actually like to hear some of the big city sounds of NYC. Otherwise the rooms are super quiet, great AC and comfortable beds. I asked for extra pillows and promptly received 4 nice fluffy ones. A nicely stocked pantry and roomy bathroom with excellent rain forest shower. I enjoyed having the pump bottles of soap, shampoo, and conditioner in the shower. Very fast, free internet. Being a small hotel, it is a short walk from the elevator to any room. An amazing rooftop bar and outdoor deck with a small pool (not big enough for swimming, but good for a cool dip). Be sure to enjoy at least one meal at the David Burke kitchen on the lower level. This property has many unique outdoor areas on different levels. Be sure to explore. My wife and I continued to find these areas throughout our stay.

The rsstaurant on the first floor has a great garden dining area which is really nice to have in the middle of town. The hotel is in the heart of soho. 5 min walk to all major shops, including Bloomingdales. The pool and bar upstairs is really for hanging out rather than swimming. The pool is tiny. I've seen bigger jacuzzis. But, again, this is manhattan. You can't expect an Olympic five lane pool! Nice views with cocktails and a trendy 20&30s type professional crowd at weekends. Overall we had a good stay. It offers what you would expect on the basis of the hotel website. At around 600 per night it's not cheap...but Soho never is.

Unfortunately it wasn't really such a memorable hotel and I do love to travel and find great boutiques... Of which NYC has a few gems. The rooms were larger than normal for NYC and the desk staff lovely enough. Unfortunately it just didn't have anything that special going for it. The interiors were fine but not unique, the views of manhattan nothing like those you can get elsewhere and it just didn't have a standout vibe or style. my biggest issue was that downstairs they were more concerned with playing bouncer in regard to the private party upstairs than letting in the clientele of the hotel. This meant at one time when the crowds were lining up we actually had real issues even getting into the hotel. As my colleague initially recommended, great to head up for the pool parties on a hot day in Manhattan,but perhaps there are better places to stay where their greater concern is the hotel guests.","London, United Kingdom","gttlondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",20,2.0

As you can imagine there have been a lot of changes to NYC and to the hotel scene over this period of time. Some hotels have figured it out better than others. The James scores high in it's delivery of customer experience. The hotel is modern, cool but not too hipster cool, it is clean, staff is friendly and efficient and there are some amazing amenities that all help to make the value factor work for me. Amenities such as; rooftop lounge and pool, gym with a view, great food on premise, complimentary bicycles, complimentary (limited hours) town car.The wine/cheese and the Colombe coffee with Balthazar pastries at breakfast were a very welcome complimentary treat! One of the things I loved (and is a huge personal pet peeve) are the 'quieter-closing' hotel doors. HATE when your neighbour or the cleaning staff continually go in and out of rooms with those loud-slamming doors. I still think that ALL hotels including the James could train their staff to let room doors close quietly behind them. It is a small refinement that speaks volumes about the respect a property has for it's customers. Location is amazing - heart of SOHO and close to West Highway for a bike ride or jog - steps from A train subway etc. Gourmet Garage is 2 blocks away.Morgan at the front desk was amazing and aided me in moving to a higher floor in an effort to catch the 4th of July fireworks and the staff was very helpful in mailing items and laundry - thx. Kenny was also very helpful in assisting with cars/cabs, bicycles and suggestions etc - incredible asset to the hotel - loved this guy.The one negative was having to take the slow elevators to the ground floor in order to get back up to the rooftop at certain hours and deal with 'nightclub-type' attitude - suddenly I felt like I was no longer a guest at the hotel.I would definitely recommend this hotel and will return again - something I rarely do because I love trying new 'hoods and hotels!","Toronto, Canada","PeterN20</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",14,5.0

They both helped us get 100% settled in the room - talking through the amenities of the cleverly designed room - electric blind, openable windows, storage seat, coffee and tea making facilities and mini bar. He also talked us through the hotel amenities and things available to us. The James is full of unexpected surprises that aren't advertised. They make you feel like royalty or a VIP. One of the surprises is complimentary cheese and wine at night before dinner! The rest - I'll leave as a surprise! The room was clean and hotel in a great location with everything within walking distance. The only thing I would say is that our room was a little close to 5th avenue and thus was a little noisy. A room higher up might reduce this issue. The pool, gym, restaurant and bar on the top level were also very impressive! There's nothing this hotel didn't have!

The hotel is gorgeous; light, contemporary and stylish but with a relaxed feel so that guests always feel at home. The rooms are compact but very well appointed with a kind of zen design, with good storage, lovely city views, and the location - on the edges of SoHo and Tribeca - is just fantastic. You're completely spoilt for choice when it comes to restaurants, bars and shops but equally the hotel restaurant and bar are very nice, although the bar gets a little too busy for us on the weekends (because the views are incredible so it draws a crowd!) There's even a small rooftop pool and sunbathing area, open seasonally from about May till October. Again, the views are fantastic. The hotel's lounge area in particular is wonderfully bright and spacious, very comfortable, and with a number of free to use computers and complimentary refreshments served throughout the day. This is a real plus point for us, because New York hotels can be extremely expensive, and yet at The James you do get great value for money because the wi-fi is free (and very good) and at breakfast, lunch and dinner there are free teas, coffees, fruit, scones and even wine, cheese and biscuits in the evening! On one stay we'd had a rather eventful journey and they brought up a free bottle of wine, which was a very nice touch. The staff are great, in particular the energetic front of house team who work on the door. Kenny is an absolute legend; a great guy who can't do enough to help you during your stay - we would literally come back to The James just to hang out with him, he's awesome.

Anything we asked of the staff, with one exception, was met with a cheerful and efficient response. For example, there was no decaf coffee set out in the morning, but after a short wait, one of the staff brought me a fresh brewed pot of decaf coffee. I also needed hot water for tea (again, none set out in the morning) and they were very accommodating fetching it for me. (Would have been nice if they had a bigger selection of teas - they only had one black tea. Luckily, I had brought my own herbals teas.). Cookies at night in the lobby and the chocolates in the room were absolutely divine! The one glitch is that the mini-fridge in my room was not cold, which I noticed right away.

The location cannot be beat. In the heart of SOHO, you are surrounded by the best of everything. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a lovely gentleman at ground level - he escorted us to the lobby level, where an equally friendly woman checked us in. The Room - we had a spacious room (by NYC standard) with floor to ceiling windows. I want to mention cleanliness. This room was immaculate and very well appointed. Roof Top Bar - we headed up to the bar on the roof. It opens at 5pm, at 5:15 this place was busy. Wonderful cocktails and AMAZING views.Breakfast - there is a David Burke Restaurant associated with the hotel. YUM! Even in NY, there is no need to opt to head out, when you can have such a fantastic breakfast in bed. Overall, this was a wonderful experience!

LOCATION: The location and architecture of the hotel make staying here a real treat. Easy walk to SOHO, Tribeca and subway stations to everywhere else. Access to main lobby is by one single small elevator which got busy during morning departures but otherwise was fine. ROOM: Room was small but modern, highly functional with very nice amenities (see pictures). Bedding and linens were very comfortable. Intelligent Nutrients bathroom amenities and snacks and minibar in room were top shelf. Housekeeping/room cleanliness was excellent but was disappointed to have housekeeping doing their evening turndown rounds after 9pm.

Close to Soho shopping area and generally walking distance to Tribeca and most subway lines. Also it's a 5 mins walk to Dominique Ansel Bakery of the cronuts fame. Definitely worth the wait. Sky gym affords nice views of lower manhattan, i.e. Freedom Tower and waters. Housekeeping was in no way invasive and rather anticipatory; cleaned without rearranging too many personal items and they seem to know when to turn down your room.Upon check out as I was really rushing for a train at Penn station as a result of lining up for the cronuts, and I haven't packed my luggage, I asked them to prepare all the check out procedures, get a cab at 9.30am sharp, and provide me small bills for a 100. All was done and ready waiting for me. I was out of the hotel in 2 mins after i left my room.

We prefer the Soho/Greenwich Village area of New York - away from the hustle & bustle & more 'touristy' area of Times Square etc. This was perfect - a short walk in either direction to Soho or Greenwich Village - the walk gave you time to really appreciate the areas and especially walking to Greenwich Village the opportunity to view possibly some of the most expensive properties in NYC.The James offered though so much more than just a dream location ....The staff were extremely friendly & nothing appeared to be too much trouble for them . On arrival John at the concierge desk quickly welcomed us & took care of our luggage & called ahead to the reception that we had arrived - the check in process therefore took from arriving to being in the lift taken to our room 5 minutes - ideal after a long delayed flight & a quite 'scary' taxi ride from JFK. All requests made by us to the staff were warmly received - we asked the concierge for the best way to get to the Diamond District one morning & were told instead that the in house car would be able to take us instead for free.When the in house car was not available the concierge had no issues in hailing taxi's for us - never appreciated more than when we were running late for a theatre performance seemingly at the same time as the whole of Manhattan decided to also take a cab - without help we would never had got there on time !!The little touches provided such as coffee & fresh baked scones in the morning, cheese & wine in the evening & the most amazing cookies in the evening all provided free along with the provision of free WiFi throughout the entire hotel really made in our opinion this a stand out hotel - its still shocks me that some 5 star hotels still try to charge for WiFi or any grade hotel really!The rooms were simple & well designed - we stayed on the 14th Floor - views of a bustling NYC were a real 'wow' factor & the large windows allowed you to really appreciate the change in the skylight from morning to the evening - also on a personal note even though the room was air conditioned I really liked the the windows could be opened slightly - nothing beats a blast of fresh air in the morning to clear the cobwebs.The bed was super comfortable and the storage space was well laid out - additional drawers were available under the settee area along with a small table and chair for sitting to dine in room or do work at. The walk in shower in the bathroom was spacious with huge bottles of premium shampoo, conditioner & shower gel provided - I hate the small bottles often provided. Lots of fluffy towels, robes & slippers & an innovative privacy screen in the bathroom ( the bathroom was only separated from the room by a glass screen) made the room a pleasure to return to after a long day walking around NYC.One morning we treated ourselves to breakfast in bed - delivered hot & on time by a lovely lady - the breakfast was gorgeous , nothing missing on the tray & a plentiful supply of tea. My dream morning - in bed eating breakfast watching numerous 'Housewives of ...' on Bravo whilst from the window being able to see NYC waken up.We also treated ourselves to a few late night drinks at the rooftop bar at Jimmy's ......again the staff were attentive & the cocktails were fab - ordering off menu was no problem & again the view was breathtaking .....I would have been happy to spend every night at Jimmy's. For such a luxurious looking bar - almost like a private members bar it did not give off any airs of exclusivity - the staff made everyone feel so welcome that you were not intimidated at all which sometimes I feel when you go to extremely high standard bars. The outside terrace and pool though they looked amazing we could not appreciate fully as it was minus 0 in NY during out stay but I could imagine in the summer you would have a blast at Jimmy's ...that pool with that view .....we're booking to go back in the summer just to try it out !All in all what works about this hotel is the little touches & everything has a real thought behind it - from the extra magnifying mirror in the bathroom to the in room duty free bar (Patron,Grey Goose,Makers Make......you could have a field day by not even leaving the room) to the lovely bottle of red wine & hand written note we received from guest services to the chocolates left at turn down to the staff whom nothing was too much trouble - this hotel should be a great pride to all who work there as it is amazing & I think we've just found 'our NY hotel.'

Located downtown just north of Canal St, it is proximate to the A/C/E, 1, and 6 subway lines within a 1-5min walk. The first thing you notice about The James, besides its discreet, modern entrance with minimal signage, is that it is tall and essentially perched on stilts, putting it higher than many of the nearby buildings. The lobby itself is a short elevator ride from the street level reception area where the doormen warmly greet people.The lobby, and all areas of the hotel, are modern and filled with contemporary art (carefully marked with signs, like a museum or gallery). The staff I dealt with at the front desk were all uniformly friendly and helpful and, while I can't recall all their names, they were kind enough to remember mine the entire time I was there. Also in the lobby is complimentary computer terminals and a variety of light snacks (scones, fruit, cookies, crackers, cheese, coffee, wine) throughout the day. The ability to grab a little snack or drink on my way in and out of a hotel is always a much welcomed plus with me.With a prior request, I got 1606, a high-floor room on the with an open western view of the Hudson and distant planes landing at Newark (and the approach to the Holland tunnel, but in a good way!). With dark wood floors, high ceilings, large windows and a glass wall between bathroom and bedroom (more on that momentarily) the smallish room was striking. The desk & chair area looked mid-century modern, but probably wouldn't be well-suited to doing serious hours hunched over a laptop. The platform bed had crisp sheets and down bedding for a very cozy, restful night's sleep. I will say the dark wood shows a bit of wear that a lighter color might not, and there were some definite signs of food traffic on the area rug. Not horrible, but a clear reminder that lots of people had been there before you--which is never a plus in a hotel.Now, the bathroom with its glass stall shower, high end fixtures, and clear dividing wall could be seen as a selling point or a major repellant depending on your sense of privacy, style, and with whom you are traveling. Though there is an art-covered screen between bath and bed you can raise or lower with the push of a button, it is still quite translucent and may not be to everyone's taste. I was traveling solo and my room didn't face any residential buildings, so I wasn't too concerned. Others might be. This high-style spot was great for me, but I think it would be suited most to fashion-forward sorts who want visual stimulation, a downtown location, and aren't shy with any traveling companions they may have. Though the staff is certainly friendly, it doesn't strike me as a good place for families.","Rhinebeck, New York","DeanPok</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rhinebeck, New York</strong>",48,5.0

We usually stay at the Trump SOHO but decided to try staying at the James Hotel and had read many positive reviews about it. However, it was a disappointing stay at the James. On our reservation, we had ordered a roll away bed. Unfortunately, it was not delivered to our room and we had to make three requests from the front desk and when it finally arrived, the sheets were never put on the bed. The television was not working properly and when we called the desk we were told there was a signal problem with many of the televisions and only certain channels could be viewed. The staff was unfriendly and argumentative when we brought concerns to their attention. We had ordered the Winter Special package which included breakfast and drinks, but later found out that we were charged for these on our bill. When looking for additional outlets for our cell phones, we discovered a plate with chocolates in a night table drawer-not sure if these were left from the previous guests.This hotel has great potential and it is a shame that the service left such a bad taste for us.

The James delivers in spades when it comes to a pleasant destination, comfortable hospitality and good value. I have stayed at the James multiple times for an extended period two years ago. The staff, especially in-room dining and styling, remembered my like of almond milk, making sure it was available, my need for two bottles of water in the evening and my like of a particular white wine that was always put in my room. Two years later I am back and delighted to find many of the same faces who remembered the almond milk, water and wine, not to mention were very enthusiastic to welcome me back. The design of the hotel is perfectly appointed and understated. All that you might need and nothing more. The art is unique and well presented. The amenities perfectly satisfying without being too ""studied"" or too ""standard"". I will say that the rooftop bar and pool make for the only counterpoint to the quietude of the rest of the experience especially when eager goers find their way clamoring through the lobby to find their way to the roof. And, if you are on the highest floor, you will find yourself irked by the noise. So, make sure to book yourself in a room no higher than the 15th floor! And, when you're ready to head back into the city, you will find Soho and TriBeCa at your beck and call, not to mention in one of the city's most accessible points. Though tucked downtown, you are a stone's through from the main access points to everywhere in the city.

The concierge, Morgan, was kind & helpful- she helped get us in to some pretty exclusive clubs & also went above and beyond to celebrate our birthdays. Our first evening we came home to a chocolate covered red velvet cake that said ""happy birthday"" with a sweet note from the hotel. The rooms are nicely decorated with an awesome bathroom- see through optional (you can close the shade if you don't want the person in the bedroom to see you in the shower), and super comfy bed. Even though this was a girls trip, I would HIGHLY recommend it to couples, as they have some ""fun"" items on the mini bar & again the ""see through bathroom"".

It is the opposite of a sweet or girlie hotel. Love the bathroom amenities; shampoo, shower gel and conditioner, they are all very special and not in those small bottles neither in attached to the wall dispenser.We got the corner room and it was pretty, optimum view because of the glasses walls. New York hotels are famous to be small so we cannot really complain about the size. One thing that I didn't like about the room was that it was freezing, it might because that the corner room used glasses as the walls.I was expecting more from the bar on the top floor, it was more like a place to work for some people when we tried to go there in one afternoon, no music, a pity as we got free cocktail voucher for two. In-room dining burger was very good. We tried once to have lunch in the hotel but could not find the restaurant, it might be that the patio area which we went to for that lunch time was not opened in October, fair enough.

The public spaces are intriguing, inviting, eclectic. The staff- friendly, efficient, available. David Burke kitchen- food was good, service a bit uneven in that they kind of leave you alone to linger which is fine if you want to linger, but just check on us every once in a while because eventually I need the bill and to get going. Valet parking cost a bit steep. If you are there on a weekend you just might find some on street parking which will save you a bundle. View from our room (which was incredibly well designed and while small did not feel small because of the excellent design). Didn't make it to the rooftop bar because when I was inclined to go it was closed for a private party. That actually bugs me that spaces that are supposed to be available to hotel guests are suddenly not available, but it's not like my mentioning it will change anything. I will enjoy the rooftop pool when I return. There is something otherworldly about being able to swim while lofted high in the sky. If the pool was heated and open I would have done it in December, but, alas, the pool is closed for the season. Room service was prompt. Room was very clean.

I was on the 17th floor, same floor as the gym and bar. With my clock set for a 4am wake up for an early flight, I attempted to turn in around 10p. The cleaning crew started banging around at 11p in the gym and then moved to the bar at midnight. Finally I got so fed up I went storming down the hall in my underwear and asked the cleaning crew what the hell was going on. They were vacuuming, cleaning and yucking it up in the gym with the doors open to the hallway. I called the front desk afterward to complain and the little dude patronized me by saying he would come up there right away. When I hung up, I heard the little front desk dude on the two way radio telling the crew to be quiet (the two-way radio exchange was even louder than the crew on their own). I called right back and got the same little dude and he had the nerve to tell me he had already been “up there” and spoken with the crew. I yelled and asked, “Do you think I am stupid? You didn’t have time to come up here and I just heard you on the two-way radio!”Finally got about two hours sleep as I was so hyped up.

In many ways this is a great property - location, stunning views, well designed, two superb outdoor places (terrass and roof), low key charming service, beautiful and well planned room, great shower etc. It was all set out to be a perfect and very comfortable weekend. Unfortunately, in the end the hotel seems to miss that final touch / attention to detail to ensure perfection:- stayed in a room on the 17th floor, just below the bar. Was warned there could be disturbance during the bar service. Sure - DJ, music and a lot of people but actually not that bad. However, once the bar closed it sounded like the demolition crew had moved it and it lasted until early morning. The clean up of the bar was done in a way more appropriate for a building site than a hotel. Simple fix - am sure the clean up could be done with some more care and everyone would be happier ...- upon check out we asked to have our bags picked up and we would collect them from the door man in 2h time. Leaving for the airport, the bags were nowhere to be found. A 5 min turn around became a 30 min chasing frenzie and in the end they were found in our room, not yet picked up ... Small things but those are the ones making a difference between good average and excellence. Thought of sharing these experiences with the General Manager in order to help them improve for the future, no response was ever received to my email ...All in all, the fundaments for an outstanding hotel are in place but still not there.","Copenhagen, Denmark","JakobBengt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Copenhagen, Denmark</strong>",38,3.0

Our room on the downtown east corner was drop dead divine - see the pics I took after we arrived. Loved the bathroom - so good I got over the fact there was no bath (and that's big for me). The toiletries were beautiful. The lobby has a lovely vibe and it was great being able to wander down and enjoy the complimentary food and drinks. The staff were great. The concierge chaps and doormen we dealt with were warm, friendly and super helpful - with zero hipster attitude, which is always a risk in upmarket, downtown NYC establishments. I wish I'd gotten their names to mention them here. The front desk staff seem to work very long hours - they'd be there late at night and again early the very next morning, but managed to stay cheerful and professional. Our room was beautifully made up each day too. Overall the service was wonderful. Where The James missed the mark for me was the hospitality side of equation. The restaurant was a major disappointment when we tried it for breakfast. The rooftop bar Jimmy has a great fit out and is obviously very hip but it was not a place I wanted to spend time in because it was a hassle to access and not very comfortable. Also tried the garden bar one evening but it was late and full of young drunken city workers so wasn't conducive to having a relaxing glass of wine which is what we wanted. They had the most impressive in-room snacks/minibar - a unique opportunity to sample some amazing products. Happily being in such a great location it was easy to walk out the door and find great places to eat and drink, particularly with the station for the ACE subway line around the corner.

This boutique property has a distinctive style that really gives it a true feeling and character seldom found in NYC properties. My most recent trip was a week long stay for work. PROS:--extremely friendly and accommodating staff--spacious rooms with a nice design. Contemporary. Clean lines.--HUGE windows and no views of a building wall (my biggest pet peeve in NYC)--location is convenient to most things--they believe in added value. Complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings. Complimentary coffee and scones in the morning. --food was quite tasty. Good selection. Of course overpriced...but hey--it's NYC. What do you expect?CONS:--indoor common space is small...the lobby area is the size of a small library. So, if you're wanting to meet and mingle, but indoors, may not have much option besides the restaurant--I was a bit disappointed in the cleanliness of my room when I checked in. They were at capacity the day before, and I think they rushed cleaning. I had to have them come back and do some things over...but they were very accommodating--thin walls...you can hear everything going on in the hallway, and that's with people speaking at average volumes. I didn't run into issues sleeping, but I was also VERY tired every night. Overall, a nice 2nd choice for a soho/tribeca area stay. I definitely recommend the property","New York City, New York","ATLHotelLuva</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",71,4.0

We spent a week there recently, and it was an amazing experience.Our room was on the 17th floor, with amazing view of the Hudson across to New Jersey. Very comfortable room, with everything we needed. There was a well stocked bar (at minibar prices) robes, and an exceptionally comfortable bed. The bathroom had a glass wall with a curtain that descends at a flick of a switch and a large walk-in shower.One small downside was that we were directly below Jimmy's (see below) and at the weekend there was the faint sound of music above and lots of banging of doors outside (the floor seems to be an access for staff going up and down). The 17th floor is also where the gym is located with great views across towards the East River.It's the little touches that make The James special. Complimentary filtered water and ice in the room. Helpful and friendly staff.The James club is an area in the Sky Lobby (light, glass walls, comfortable, relaxed) where guests can sit and read the papers and have complimentary coffee and fresh pastries at breakfast, fruit during the day, and cheese and (very nice) wine in the early evening. It was great to have the option to get coffee in the morning, whether sitting and planning our day, or 'grabbing and going'.We didn't make use if the hotel's two restaurants during our stay, as there are so many in the area, but they looked pretty good.Now, onto the perhaps the biggest draw. The rooftop pool and bar. The views are simply stunning. You can just spend time sitting and looking across to the Hudson in one direction, towards The WTC in another, and across the city towards Manhatten bridge in another.The pool itself is a great addition (we were there in summer during the humid heat) but be aware that it has restricted hours. At 4.30 the staff ask guests to start vacating loungers ready for opening of Jimmy's (the bar) which is open to the public. That's okay - we didn't come to NYC to sit by the pool, but it's worthwhile knowing this so you don't plan on a refreshing dip after a hot day's sightseeing. Best to go there in the morning when it's open before heading out.Also, while we were there, at the weekend it was opened for a a very busy pool party. Not much room, lots of people strutting and a DJ playing loud music. All exciting stuff and very Soho (if a bit reminiscent of a Spring Break).After 5pm, the rooftop area is transformed to Jimmy's, the bar, which itself has amazing views out towards the Empire State building. It gets very crowded, as can be expected with these views and location, and the drinks err on the expensive side (plastic glasses of course - we are on the 18th floor), but the bar staff are experienced and you don't have to wait long. The James is a great hotel in the heart of Soho. It's both relaxing and vibrant and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. We were so impressed that we've booked to stay at The James Royal Palm for our next visit to South Beach Miami in March.","Surrey, United Kingston","TheChris_Morgan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Surrey, United Kingston</strong>",62,5.0

In the living room there was only one naked bulb, without any screen, like in a prison cell (at our request another lamp was added, but the naked bulb remained there for the four days), One day we went to swimming in the pool while left some coffee and juice from the breakfast for our return, but it was taken away. Meanwhile, the room was not done, beds, etc. At my request, more coffee was served, but the last day they pretended to charge an entire extra breakfast,Another day one of the bathrobes was also taken away, which made our visit to the pool delayed for hours. On Sunday, the elevator to the rooftop was blocked still at 11am. At 6:30pm the room was not yet done.As the last day we had breakfast in the restaurant, the order was mixed up (sausage for bacon, no bread).My impression is that the staff doesnt care at all; they might be working there just for a little while; may it be that this carelessness has become typical newyorker?","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Hello b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",0,2.0

The first visit was three years ago when they had first launched. At that time, the food and beverage operation was yet to open, as was the garden and rooftop pool. They have since opened these and added further services, such as a courtesy car service for the local area. So this was a return full of excited anticipation. As per first visit, the door staff do not offer to take your luggage – I'm still confused by that, but no big issue. They direct you to the next floor where you check-in. This is friendly and welcoming (although the comment, ""You're staying for one night only"" seemed unnecessary. I'd actually booked for a 2nd the day before. Perhaps it wasn't displaying in the system yet). As a morning arrival, the room wasn't ready yet so I was invited to help myself to their complimentary pastries and coffee in the sun-drenched lounge area, where you can read papers and have the use of two Apple Mac desktop computers. At midday, reception called to inform me the room was ready – two hours before the nominated check-in time. Some attention to the issue of hotel guests accessing Jimmy, the rooftop bar in the evening would be a step in the right direction. After 9pm, hotel residents must use a different elevator to reach Jimmy. God help you if you happen to leave your room key with the (superb) hostesses in the bar. Because the doorman below will refuse to believe you. As a result, you are unable to enter your room, unable to retrieve the key which is 17 floors above with the bar staff. You are effectively stranded. And the doorman is not interested in your explanation. Now, the best thing about this hotel is that – built from the ground up, and with no neighbouring buildings of equal height – you get a decent view of the Manhattan skyline no matter which room you're in. I was on the 16th floor (so no noise from the rooftop bar) and, despite being the entry-level room, was afforded magnificent views up 6th Ave, down Tribeca and across the Hudson. Full height windows emphasise the panoramic views. The rooms have a decent height and this really enhances the rainforest shower in the well-proportioned bathroom, complete with Intelligent Nutrients cleaning products. The bathroom and generously-sized bed are definitely my personal highlights of The James. The complimentary wi-fi, plus morning pastries & coffee/ evening cheese & wine define this establishment’s premium credentials. Its location, at the quieter end of SoHo, bordering onto Tribeca, is ideal. And, whilst it is just beginning to show signs of wear (and someone else's hair in the bath towels), I will continue to return. Thanks for a mainly pleasant stay (4.5/ 5).",London,"nomad_class</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",10,4.0

After being mislead on the website that the hotel had a Lil James package we were expecting tickets to the Childrens Museum, Paul Frank pyjays and whoopie cookie turn down. What we got was shrugged shoulders claiming no knowledge of the above. Time to update the website! The room was gorgeous but it wasn't until we had showers that we saw big black clumps of hair all over the shower and bathroom floor. There was also black hairs all over the bed. (We are a family of blonde hair). The rooftop bar was closed for a function, so no trying the famous ""Old Fashioned"". The pool gets busy from opening time 8am and smokers delight in the rooftop pool. Staff were models with no check in skills. When I asked for our room to be cleaned I was told ""But you are checking out this afternoon?"" On the website it states twice daily room cleaning and since our room was NOT CLEANED IN THE FIRST PLACE, I did not think this was too much to ask! The overnight staff are way more efficient. The day time staff looked good but had no knowledge on the area. There are two bikes for use, you need to book these as soon as you check in as they are popular. They offer an in house chauffeur which I booked, and then confirmed a second time by phoning the front desk, for a 9.30am pick up. When I went to the lobby I was told the chauffeur had taken another ride and that he would be knocking off at 10am and we'd have to find our own way to the High Line. Again, do not confirm the booking if you cannot follow through. The rooms are stunning but the wood floors are showing serious signs of wear and tear for a hotel that has only been open for two years. The David Burke kitchen is amazing, staff are wonderful, cannot praise this restaurant enough. It is set in one of NYC's best rooftop gardens. The two operating lifts are slow. People going up and down to the rooftop get preference over hotel guests. The waiting area is lovely with complimentary wine, cheese, grapes and mini scones and coffee in the morning. The wifi is fast and there are complimentary computers with printers in the main lobby.

But a few glitches ruined the lux feeling. With so many other options available in the area I wouldn't recommend this hotel given the price tag associated with it.Everyone was super nice and pleasant, but for us it was the actions (or lack of) that spoke louder than words. The main frustration stemmed from a de-evolution of the lux experience over our 3-night stay. Simple things from a plush bath rug on day one to a simple bath mat towel on day two to the cold tile on day three. Another example was two bottles of their ""triple filtered water"" and a fresh bucket of ice on night one to only one bottle on night two to no ice on night three. Even though we kept the room neat and tidy, maybe housekeeping had it in for us? They turned the AC off on one of the hottest/muggiest days and our last night was quite uncomfortable. When we turned the AC back on it only intermittently blew cool air. We didn't bother calling the front desk since an earlier service call regarding the TV not working went unresolved. It's too bad we were left with the feeling that things went south after check-in because the property has a terrific design and many of the staff were very helpful in other respects (luggage, transportation, etc.). We travel frequently and typically enjoy our hotel experiences immensely.

No problem, they upgraded us to a room with a very large double bed and a second slightly smaller room which were connected by their own enclosed small hall, so perfect. They also kindly gave us breakfast for our first morning by way of an apology.CleanlinessWhatever you've read about this hotel being dusty is just untrue, the floors look dusty but I have to say that the hotel was spotless throughout and I am very fussy, just ask my wife!Food & DrinkWe ate once here for breakfast (our comp breakfast) and once to try the David Burke Kitchen. The breakfast was ok and the food at DBK was overly complicated and a little bit up itself with not a lot of substance but ok. Beware of the cost though, it ain't cheap!We did have some great cocktails and the wine list is also not bad.RoomsRooms are great and excellently looked after by the maids both sides of the day, with some great views out over Manhattan.Swimming PoolThe main reason I chose The James was because it had an outdoor pool and to be honest, if that's your criteria too, then you'll be disappointed.As with many other people, this is where the issue lies. The pool is small and cold but ok for a quick dip to cool off and there is somewhere, albeit very small to catch a few rays (if you get up there early enough to bag a bed). The drawback arrives with the members of Jimmys. You are told that you have use of the pool until 5pm and this just isn't true. three out of our seven days, we were only able to be there until 2.40pm because of 'private parties"" the rest of the time, we were allowed to be there until 5pm but at 4.30 everyone is moved and made to feel very uncomfortable so that the sun-beds can all be lined up and stripped of your towels in readiness for Jimmys' members. Hotel guests are made to feel like second class citizens falling a long way behind Jimmys' members and this smacks of greed on behalf of the hotel.Jimmys is popular and The James is proud of this fact but as a hotel guest all that means to you is that you will find it hard to get in the lift after about 3.30 in the afternoon and generally you just won't have any access to the pool whatsoever.I've found this a very tough review to write because I really wanted to be clear in my views, the hotel and most of the staff are great and happy to help but Jimmys and one or two other small gripes left me sure that I would not return.","London, United Kingdom","Chubbychubs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",136,3.0

I booked restaurants via the concierge, Morgan and they were dealt with efficiency and she also gave great recommendations to local activities in the area.Our arrival: a sincere and friendly welcome from Michael who assisted with our luggage. The check-in by Chris was smooth and after a long flight from South Africa, he gave us early access to our room. This was really appreciated as we wanted to freshen up before we hit the streets at midday.We had a King corner room which was spacious and clean with a beautiful view of the surrounding area. The bathroom was large with a huge shower. The mini bar was of maxi quality with very reasonable prices. Various snacks were also offered. The safe, iron and ironing board was appreciated and used. There is also a gym on the 17th floor with all the proper equipment needed with a beautiful view of the city. Housekeeping was friendly and all requests were addressed immediately. The hotel has an amazing bar and pool on it's roof. This gave a welcome relief in the summer heat with fantastic views, great cocktails and beers. Rolando, the barman was friendly and efficient... and made great cocktails. This spot turns into a energetic night club at night with brilliant DJ's and dancing...at our age we did feel slightly old but it was a load of fun. The hotel serves complimentary muffins and coffee in the mornings, fruit and water during the day and wine and cheese with biscuits during the early evening. We really loved this as in the mornings you can plan and kick start your day and in the evenings you can come back and relax and reminisce about your day. Alternatively you can start your evening with a glass of wine before going out to your restaurant. The best is that they have freshly baked chocolate chip cookies during the late evening and we had our fair share of those. The wi-fi was of good quality and fast for our purposes.The location of the hotel is great. You are walking distance from Soho, TriBeCa and the Meat packers district with numerous shops, boutiques and restaurants. The subway is also very close and you can get buses and taxi's in the main road alongside the hotel. The porters are very helpful and a taxi stops in no time.We also enjoyed a great dinner in the hotel at the David Burke Kitchen restaurant.

With that background, we were really looking forward to our first stay at the James NYC. The hotel is a beautiful property, in an incredible location. Within 3-5 blocks of the hotel are some great shops and restaurants, and there are 2 subway stations very nearby (the A/B/C and 1 (with a nearby 2/3)) which made for easy and convenient travel to other parts of the City. A little farther away (5-10 blocks) is an incredible stretch along and around Greenwich Street, with even more (and more amazing) bars, cafes and restaurants. It was very easy walking around the entire area. It was even easier to navigate back to the hotel, as it towers over most of the surrounding buildings and has a distinctive design on the roof which stands out. We loved the Citibike station right across the street from the hotel as well.Our hotel room was amazing - it was a corner room with floor to ceiling windows and a breathtaking view of WTC 1. It really was a stunning room & we couldn't have been happier with it.Unfortunately, we couldn't shake the feeling for most of our stay that the main focus of the property is on its bar business (especially Jimmy) and not on the needs and comfort of its hotel guests. While there is an exterior, separate elevator for accessing Jimmy (but not guest floors) we were confronted every evening with Jimmy staff using the interior elevators (which access the guest floors) to take bar-goers up to and down from Jimmy. This led to three main problems for hotel guests - (1) having to wait for a long time for an elevator to stop at your guest floor; (2) even then, not being able to get onto the elevator because it was crowded with Jimmy patrons (who were most often clearly annoyed at the interrupting stop on their way to or from the bar) and (3) being repeatedly asked to ""prove"" we were hotel guests by showing our room keys to the Jimmy staff at the elevator doors on the ground floor, making sure we were actually on our way to someplace we were allowed to be and weren't trying to sneak onto the roof. To that last point, I have to admit it was disturbing that bar-goers could stop on our guest floor, since the hotel staff would swipe their key to allow the elevator to travel travel, which then allowed anyone riding the interior elevators to stop at any floor along the way. Meanwhile, as hotel guests, we were often reminded we could only go to Jimmy during their off-hours. We were told we could ask the front desk to put our names on the list and ""most likely"" go up (by the exterior elevator only, we were told.) We didn't experience any big problems - we just really disliked feeling that we weren't as important as the people the hotel allowed (and wanted) to go to Jimmy.I should stress the Garden & Tree House bar were really nice - we had great food and drinks in a really cool setting many different times throughout the stay, including brunch and late-night. We never ate in David Burke's Kitchen, but had drinks there several times and really enjoyed them and the setting. Also, the doormen and concierge were always very friendly and the housekeeping staff were exceptional. With the quality of the hotel and the incredible location, this property has every opportunity to be as special as the James Chicago. Unfortunately, to do so, it first has to make its hotel guests feel like something other than a necessary nuisance to their bar business.

While the rooms may not be large they are ultra modern finished well with ipod doc, super high end mini bar and bathroom soaps and gels. The beds were super comfortable but the pillows are way too soft but the James even has a note mentioning order whatever pillow you would like if the standard ones are not to your liking. From 6pm the have wine and cheese in the lobby which while very basic and for a while they were out of glasses it is a nice touch. The James has a very popular roof top pool/bar which pumps on the weekend and considering how many non hotel guests are trying to get in its the place to be. It was nice on a Wednesday to have my friends join me for sunset drinks before we headed out in NYC. Cocktails are a bit expensive but as you could expect with views of the Hudson river like that. NB: The pool is small so not really one for swimming. The location is good with many good bars and restaurants within 5 minuets walk away. Check out was at 2pm which helped for our late flight back home. The only one disappointment was that one of the concierge staff didn't seem to be able to acquire tickets to a show which from later knowledge should have been manageable. Overall I can recommend The James, you get what you pay for as the extra $150 a night over basic hotels is worth while.","Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","JetBenji</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates</strong>",30,4.0

I booked this solely for the fact that is has an outdoor pool which are few and far between in the city. The pool area is very nice, but rather small so if you want a chair plan ahead and get up there early. We had a woman that had managed to snag three chairs for her friends not staying in the hotel and she managed to have the pool boy back her. Ultimately the manager did the right thing which was good. The bigger issue is the fact that the pool becomes a club at 3PM on the weekends, no where on the website does it tell you this. Guests are sunning and suddenly the place is inundated with party goers, so full you can barely walk around the pool deck. I understand wanting to make the hotel a happening spot but at the expense of your guests is a questionable plan. The other issue stems from the nightclub, they have elevator monitors that are supposed to keep club goers from the hotel elevators. The issue is they have one person monitoring this at the bottom of the elevator, so when the party ends and people need to come down they pack on the hotel elevators making it had for guests to use. The rooms are nice, small but what you would expect for NY. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and luxurious. The staff was helpful when you had a problem they generally would work to fix it, again most of the issues stem from not enough control around the rooftop parties","Atlanta, Georgia","DaisyDot24</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",509,4.0

The staff is excellent and bends over backwards to help you. There is a glaring problem! There is nightclub on the roof that makes the elevators (already slow) PATHETIC from 3:00 PM until al hours. The hotel assures that the nightclub people go up a separate elevator but they come down the same ones the guests must pack on to with drunk partiers. The pool deck has only 10 recliners and so the land grab becomes extremely competitive, we had a mother who tipped the pool boy to reserve 3 chairs for non hotel guests then went to brunch, people sitting all over on cement with 30% of the chairs empty so the pool boy could get a tip. Only after complete protest from all the pool guests did the problem get fixed, and it did get fixed. At 3:00 PM the pool becomes a party place for outsiders so if you are planning to swim or sun you are doing so in the middle of a nightclub with 100 young drunks dressed to party.One last thing, I know that someone from this hotel needs to answer every review, I wish you wouldn't.

In my experience, other hotels in NYC at the same price point (or less) are far superior. While we appreciate that NYC hotel rooms are generally not spacious, the ""deluxe guestroom"" was tiny. The ""complimentary bottle of wine"" we received as part of our package was undrinkable. The glasses of wine we ordered through in-room dining were 'off', and when we called to let in-room dining know, they brought us two new glasses which were just as bad. Although the hotel's rooftop bar has a great view, its existence seems to permeate the hotel with the result that the elevators continually smell like booze and rather than feeling fresh, the hotel continually feels like it is recovering from last night's hangover.

Perfect location away from from the craziness but close enough to be convenient. Terrific concierge and bell services! Rick (with their car service) has been exceptional in making sure we are to Joffrey every morning and picked up each night. He has made a world of difference not having to clamor for a taxi in rush hour. Facilities at the hotel are superb, housekeeping is spot on and even the in-room dining has exceeded our expectations.

The staff were very attentive, pleasant and approachable, the complementary coffee and muffins in the morning and wine and cheese in the evening were appreciated and it was nice to sample some of the local wines. We enjoyed using the rooftop pool during the day - views of New York were simply amazing - comfortable loungers, the pool itself was more of a plunge pool, it was quite cold but we did not mind since the weather was so hot during our stay. We also made use of the small but well equipped gym, again a real plus for us. The hotel is in a really interesting part of New York with lots to do in the immediate area, shopping, restaurants, bars etc. Not to forget the High Line which is walking distance from the hotel. HOWEVER, during our stay we found out that Jimmys Rooftop (including the pool area) apparently does not belong to the hotel and that therefore they have not control over what goes on up there. Bearing in mind we chose the hotel because of the pool we were disappointed to find that the pool would be closed at short notice because it had been hired out to companies filming commercials or for other private events. in addition the Rooftop and Jimmys Bar would regularly hold party events on evenings and weekends, this made it impossible for hotel guests to use the area as it was packed with people not staying at the hotel, it was difficult to get served to drinks, there was nowhere to sit and only one nervous looking security guard trying to make sure that no one or no glass fell in the pool (one morning the pool was closed as it was full of broken glass resulting from the partying excess the night before). I was disappointed as I expected the rooftop to be more organised and comfortable in the evenings and also because the hotel had not been up front on the website about the fact that the rooftop is a separate operation. I would recommend this hotel for couples or groups of friends, definitely not for families BUT the hotel must be up front about the limitations on the use of the pool and rooftop as well as the fact that Jimmys Rooftop is a separate operation sometimes not accessible for guests.","London, United Kingdom","Yugosunseeker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",34,4.0

We booked 2 nights and checked in 10 minutes before check in. They said the room would take a little bit to be ready. I said fine and went to the roof to enjoy the pool. Lets start with the fact that the pool is TINY and FREEZING!!! There are only 10 lounge chairs and most of them are reserved by those 'in the know' Apparently if you book the pool package, you can reserve loungers. However, there are only 10 of them so I am not sure that it is a guarantee. I think though they were reserved for those who give the biggest tip. Two hours in, I had heard nothing about our room. I tried calling downstairs and nobody would answer the phone. My friend was meeting me there the first night so I had her ask about the room and 3 hrs in, they finally gave us our key. Not sure they would have ever called us if we didn't ask. So, at 5 pm they had us get off the loungers to re-arrange them for the evening crowd and removed all the cushions. We left soon after. We got up on Saturday and went to the pool at 830 am. We were able to get 2 loungers. On Saturday, what they don't tell you is that the rearrange the chairs at 3, leave the cushions on and open the pool to the public at the doorman's discretion. It gets extremely crowded with no room to even move around. It's fun if that's what you are looking for but had I known this in advance, I would have not come here with the kids. Also to be noted is how terrible th service is. We had to go inside to order food/drinks while the server sat behind the door engrossed in his phone. This happened both days. Also, there were never any towels and they would only bring out 5 at a time. Perhaps there is some sort of shortage. The doormen are very friendly. Otherwise, the rest of the staff is useless. Several times when I called downstairs, there would be no answer. I just think that it's a decent place for the 18-25 crowd but honestly there are better places to stay in this price range with exceptional service! I would definitely not return and discourage others.","New York City, New York","cd290</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,1.0

This hotel is in a really convenient location to metro excellent shopping and lots of very good restaurants and bars, so easy to get around from here. Only complaint is we booked tickets to see a show through concierge, being told they were very hard to get because it was a very popular musical, however they later told us they had got us 2 very good seats and although they were expensive we were very lucky and would be very happy. They cost around $450 and assumed that was the box office price however when we arrived at the show we were seated in second last row and later checking the tickets we saw the price stamped was $77 a ticket We queried this later with the hotel concierge and they said they had booked through a broking agent who charges more. We said we thought we had been misled and ripped off. They did apologise and said the normally advised guests of the booking arrangements but in our case there had been an oversight due to a new girl handling our booking.I must say the did give us a restaurant voucher for part of the misunderstanding.

Had room 609 - corner queen room. Small but everything was well placed and had just enough space for what I needed. Shower was great - but I was wishing for a bath when I was hung over on Saturday. LOL! Anyways - the bed so so comfy, just having a 2 angle view out the window was really great. I think with that kind of view the room feels bigger. I ordered room service several times and each time it only took 15 minutes and my man - Michael - he was the bomb! Too fun! Front desk staff was very helpful - the one thing lacking in the room was actual info about the hotel other than in-room dining. But as I said the staff was great with all of my questions. Loved the wine hour from 6-8, missed the coffee and pastries in the morning and the cookies at 8pm. And bonus - I booked a massage in the garden cabana - its was the best massage of my life. No joke. Total zen. Bogdan Stoia - you are the man! Thanks James Hotel for bringing that guy in to do my massage. Completely worth the price!! And bonus - check out at 2pm. YES!!!! Love that!Now - I have to say - I really enjoyed the hotel. However, the hotel pool - I tried to go on Wednesday afternoon - but there are barely any lounge chairs and the rest of the chairs are upright chairs. Very stiff for a pool setting. So I decided to get a drink at the bar Jimmy since there wasn't really any place to lounge outside. It was 4pm - and honestly the staff was so rude to me! I was the only customer (aside from a few guests in the outside lounge chairs). When I sat down at the bar the 2 bartenders looked at me like I had 2 heads. It's a hotel! Why shouldn't I get a drink at 4pm?? Anyways - so I took my $16 glass of wine and sat by the window. Meanwhile 3 staff for the evening rolled in and were so loud and obnoxious that I left. So odd! I did not go back to Jimmy. Not worth it at all. The staff sucked.So I went to the Treehouse bar thinking that might be a better place to chill. Same thing. Getting a drink at a hotel at 5pm on a wednesday is just somehow weird I guess. Don't get it. Again - I honestly felt like I was bothering the staff by making them wait on me. Annoying. So I took my drink up to the Urban Garden where apparently the bar staff can't serve and hung out there before the party I was due to go to. Somehow - The treehouse bar is completely separate from the hotel as is Jimmy (rooftop bar). Personally, and I told the bar staff at Treehouse - isn't it better to all work together? There definitely was a divide between the resturants/bars and the actual hotel. And the Hotel Staff was MUCH more friendly. I'd love to go back to that hotel but I will steer clear of the restaurants and bars. Not worth it. Honestly go to the Cafe Noir across the street. Much better atmosphere - just cash only.

We were referred by friends to The James because of their excellent reputation for providing great rooms and a cool, casual atmosphere with access to SOHO, Tribeca and The Village. We were not disappointed!When we arrived, Amy at the front desk was very friendly and offered to give us information about the hotel, amenities, the area and that we should contact her if their was anything else we needed. I had mentioned that my wife and I had been married about 6 weeks prior and without even wanting anything, when we arrived in our corner king room, there was a bottle of champagne as well as some snacks with a hand written card from the staff welcoming us to a mini-honeymoon. The room itself was amazing. We were on the 12th floor and had a unobstructed view of the new World Trade Center ""Freedom Tower"" - which was lit up Red, White and Blue at night. The beds were fantastic (and we have stayed in Westins, Four Seasons, and Ritz's). I think they had 5 different types of pillows and they were all very comfortable. They have an fantastic mini bar with great Alcohol and compliments and we loved the bobbysue's nuts! The bathroom has a fun see through window (that can be shut for privacy) and the shower head comes down from the ceiling and has plenty of room for two :)After a great lunch at Osteria Morini and some shopping in Soho, we came back to The James for some free wine and cheese in the lobby. Chris from the front desk advised us to get to the roof top about an hour before the fireworks because he wanted to make sure that we would have a view. He also warned us that we might not be able to see the entire show because a building might be in the way. We got to the rooftop about 30 minutes before the fireworks and we were able to get a great spot on the railing. We were pleasantly surprised with how much of the fireworks we could see - our view was only slightly blocked. They had a DJ playing party music before the fireworks, but then switched to more traditional Americana (Sinatra, etc) for the show. It was awesome!The next morning we woke up around 10:00 thinking we would check out and grab a bite to eat. I called down to ask about check out time believing it would be 11:00 and Chris said, ""anytime between 12:00 - 2:00"". That was perfect! We were able to get food, do a bit more shopping and come back, shower and still check out by 2:00. It was like we got two full days and only had to pay for one night. One side note, as we were walking out of our room to breakfast, we pasted a housekeeper who was very pleasant and said, ""you don't have to check out until 2:00 - enjoy your day"". We just felt like the staff wanted us to feel comfortable and to enjoy the hotel for as long as possible.When we left, my wife said to me that although we had only stayed one night, it felt like a long vacation.

The price for the James in Soho is actually cheaper than many other hotels in the area which are not as nice. The corner King Suite was magical with an amazing view of the new World Trade Centre. The bed and pillows were so comfortable we literally wanted to find out where we could buy them for our own home. When the young lady at the front desk found out we were on our honeymoon she was very sweet and congratulatory...later on that night when we arrived back at the hotel we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate strawberries waiting for us. A beautiful and unexpected surprise. Thank you so much for that! We received so much help from all of the staff, front desk and doormen (Kenny and the rest of the guys) who constantly gave us input and advice on where to visit, how to get there, nice restaurants, etc. Their help and assistance was very greatly appreciated for 2 Torontonians who had never been to New York. The city is truly awesome! But back to the hotel...it is literally steps away from the Subway which is a great way to get around the city. Clean, cheap, friendly, air conditioned and no graffitti. (Nothing like the movies from the 80's). The hotel is in the beautiful neighbourhood of Soho which is full of galleries, restaurants, shops and home to so many beautiful cast-iron buildings. The neighbourhood is a treasure and you could spend a whole day easily just wandering around there. We loved the unique design and look of the hotel - from the glass elevator, to the unique lobby, the beautiful gardens and the lovely outdoor restaurant David Burke's Kitchen which is attached to the hotel. We tried to get up to Jimmy at the James (The Terrace Pool by day - for hotel guests and happening club at night for the public) a couple of times late at night but were unable to because of private parties or because we were just a little too late. Hey - I thought New York never sleeps! Anyways we had a chance to go up during the day and enjoy a coffee on the top floor for an hour and totally enjoyed the amazing 360 view of the city. Add to that the friendly Lifeguard who sat and chatted with us and gave us a bit of a ""guided tour"" of what we were looking at. We sadly left after 3 nights but not before realizing I had forgotten our Ipod on the Ipod player in the room. I called the hotel from the airport and spoke to a friendly Guest Services Woman who informed us it had been turned in by Housekeeping. Two days later it arrived by FedEx at our house. I am sure I speak for many who have visited Trip Advisor when I say we have all stayed at beautiful hotels with lousy service, crappy hotels with great service, mediocre hotels with mediocre service. Well I can honestly say The James is an amazing hotel with an equally amazing staff. A great hotel is not just the location, or the amenities, or the room, or the food, or the neighbourhood - which The James all has - but it is made great by the wonderful staff who are the ambassadors and curators of the hotel. We were made to feel welcome and appreciated and for that we will always be grateful. Our beautiful stay at The James put the icing on our Honeymoon.

The reception is actually on the first floor, so you then have to go up in the lift! We got the friendliest welcome we have ever had in any hotel though and the receptionist was really lovely, very chatty and so helpful telling us all about the hotel and its facilities – if only all hotel receptionists were like that!Our room was on the 17th floor and was quite large by NYC standards and had great views over the Hudson (and also great sunset views!). It was clean, modern and bright and there was clever use of space with a lot of storage being under the sofa. The bathroom had a great shower and I loved the ethical toiletries too.I used the gym which was located on the same floor and it too had great views – this time of Brooklyn Bridge. It was well equipped, very clean and well maintained and never too busy, so I really enjoyed using it.In the lounge which was very bright and comfortable, there were delicious pastries and coffee every morning and also wine and cheese in the early evenings (although the cheese had usually all gone!) and cookies later on, which was a nice touch.We ate breakfast in the David Burke Kitchen the first morning but didn’t bother again as although the food was good when it eventually arrived, the service was appalling. We also had drinks in Jimmy’s, the rooftop cocktail bar; it is so good up there, great cocktails and great atmosphere. The rooftop pool looked good too but is rather small. The hotel also has lots of fabulous artwork all around it and a nice outside area.We thought the location was brilliant, Soho is a great area with all its art galleries, boutiques, restaurants and bars which are all so easy to get to from the hotel, as is the subway.

The trip was full of uncertanity especially as the hotel were not sure if they would be open. At the last minute they told us that we would be put in another hotel near Grand Central at first we were horified as we had taken so much time chosing the James. The replacement hotel was nowhere near the same standard and would have been a huge dissapointment. However upin arriving at the sub std replacement hotel we were told the James had been re opened and we couldn't have been happier.We arrived to a fantastic hotel in the most amazing location right in Soho. In my opinion the restaurants and shopping is far superior to central Manhattan where I have been lots before.The hotel i simply amazing. We had booked a corner suite and two sides of the room are glass giving you the most amazing views towards Freedom Tower.We decided to eat and drink in the hotel on the first night of 4 and the restaurant is totally awesome a little pricey but worth every cent. The fish was freshly caught by the chef that day on his boat and the steak that my Girlfriend had was simply amazing ( I had some of it ).The wine list was great and the desserts well the dessert is still memorable for the right reasons now.All in all if you want a great hotel with great views and a great restaurant and roof top bar then chose the James. However please be ware the staff are typical new yorkers in the way they deal with you but what else do you expect when in New York. The bathroom are so awesome as the bathroom is glass and the room is mainly glass walled so when you are in the shower or doing anything in the bathroom you can see right out across the city.The guy who runs the door I forget his name but he has worked and lived locally for many years is so knowledgeable and happy to help with anything and he is well worth tipping for his help he can help you out with just about anything you need and has some great local knowledge.So I guess the real question is would we return again and the answer is yes :- the location is perfect, the rooms are spotless and so well cleaned, the hotel is funky, the restaurant is great if you want to keep it simple and eat in and the roof top bar with the little pool outside is a great little place to finish the night off in.","Portsmouth, United Kingdom","PaulDRSouthampton</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portsmouth, United Kingdom</strong>",43,4.0

Overall the staff were excellent, great food, could be the perfect hotel. The main problem is that the James cannot decide whether it is primarily a high end hotel or a hot-spot for local night life. The pool is open to the public and every evening cushions are removed from lounge chairs to ""protect them for guests"" and there is constant monitoring / surveillance and checking for your status (appreciated, but inconvenient and impersonal). Frequent private events close the facilities to hotel guests. Very popular night spot with locals which could be wonderful depending on your goals, but leads to huge streams of loud and drunk revelers. Though a separate elevator exists for visitors to the rooftop and hotel guests, there is constant confusion leading to overcrowding, very long waits for elevators, and frequent attempts to direct traffic by stressed out staff at these times who bark instructions and try to redirect people rather than asking ""are you a hotel guest?"" first. If you are looking for a lovely hotel and vibrant party scene this place is utterly perfect. If you want to separate the two and enjoy a luxurious and tranquil experience this is not the place to go (though it really could be as the rooms and facilities are spectacular!).

After staying Uptown last time we visited, this was a good place to explore Soho, Greenwich Village, Little Italy and Chinatown on foot, with some good restaurants, diners and shopping nearby. Hotel staff were helpful and courteous and some nice touches of pastries in the morning and wine in the evening. If you are under 30 and body beautiful you will feel at home in rooftop bar, which does attract members of the public for private parties and pool parties, as the hotel is open for non-guests there is a slightly complicated way of getting in and out which we had mastered after 4days but you do feel a bit over-run by the party scene at night and more so at the weekend. Our one and only visit to the garden bar was also mobbed by some private function, obviously a magnet for twenty something Newyorkers.

The hotel's in a great location, in SoHo, close to several shops, bars and restaurants, and with a Subway station just around the corner - this made it easy to get to and from pretty much everywhere.The hotel and rooms are beautifully decorated, modern and airy. The rooms especially are very spacious and clean with great views, and the bathroom too was great. Reception staff on the whole were good and willing to help.Now for the bad... The hotel has a terrace bar, gym, rooftop bar/pool and a connection to a restaurant, all of which are open to the general public, and this made our stay very frustrating; every time we entered the hotel, we were asked by the doormen if we were staying as guests/visiting one of these areas (as members of the public). We would then be asked the same question at the lifts by different people who would generally be loitering by them, probably to direct members of the public to the area they were looking for. Then we would have to wait ages for a lift, because these public clients were using them, and when they did arrive, we'd have to share them with often pretentious and quite vulgar people.This might not seem like such a big deal, but as my partner commented, you really get the impression that, despite the money you've paid out to stay at the hotel as a 'guest', you're seen as a second-class citizen, and this grates after a while.Overall, the hotel would be exceptional if it was just a 'hotel' - perhaps they could have a separate lift/entrance for hotel guests? For that reason, I wouldn't stay here again and will likely stick to hotels that are more concerned with their guests than their money-making amenities geared towards to general public.",London,"kt9388</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",3,3.0

My first impression it was not what I was quite expecting. They certainly have done a very good job with their website and photography to make this hotel look far more glamourous than what it actually is. For example, the rooftop pool bar looks amazing on their web page but in reality its just a few wooden sun loungers around a pool no bigger than an oversized bathtub. We stayed in a king room. THe room was very small. Enough for a double bed and an ensuite, but it was clean and modern with a nice double shower. The service in the hotel was pretty good, although we were not very demanding. We ordered room service and the food came within 20 minutes, was good quality and was hot. The rest of the staff were also very helpful and friendly. THe best thing about this hotel has to be the location. Its a 2 minute walk to the subway and you are right in the middle of a very sophisticated nightlife with trendy bars and restaurants at your finger tips. This is definitely what you are paying the premium price for. However, just around the corner is The Soho Grand, which had much more glam than the James, I would give that hotel a try next time.

Last time I was in NY, I lived there, so it was a bit strange to be a 'tourist'. The location is perfect: close to the A,C as well as the major hubs of Canal St. It's right on the border of TriBeCa, SoHo and Chinatown, so there is a ton to do in the area if you wanted to just stay close to 'home'. The Staff at the James was outstanding. They were all truly professional, yet friendly and approachable. Upon check-in, we were pretty early, but the Staff managed to get us checked-in and also upgraded us to a corner Queen. If you know NY, then you know a view is something you pay for, but who really wants a view when you're in the middle of NY: you'll be outside exploring, so don't really need a view. The room was always well-kept and tidy. Yes, it's a bit small, but they do a great job of maximizing the space in the room. Again, this is NY. I've lived in a room that size with three other people, so this was perfect! There is always someone around and we felt very secure. We did not go to the restaurant or Club--just not something we were into. When we checked out, I got into the elevator at 4:30 AM and three revelers were heading down from teh rooftop bar. They were dressed extremely posh (Guys in suits and ties, girl in trendy attire), but absolutely reeked of booze. They looked like they had a good time.

As such, the service went way beyond the usual professionally polite and courteous service to something intuitive and personal whereby I felt not merely well served, but cared for. Each individual member of the James staff, from manager to room attendant, was unabashedly helpful and sympathetic, which left me feeling like I was being treated with real understanding and not merely a show of professional courtesy, Quickly into my stay I felt as if I were surrounded by family, which I find remains highly noteworthy.(Just an observation for those of you who are mold sensitive; the location was subject to Hurricane Sandy and could be a bit of a challenge if you are so disposed.)","New York City, New York","Bluepoptraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",0,5.0

Our family of 3 adults and 1 teenager stayed for 6 nights in what is marketed as a “family suite”, being two adjacent rooms (a “corner king studio” and a queen standard guestroom) which are not inter-connecting but which have (a rather flimsy) outside door which closes off the two rooms from the public corridor thus allowing some privacy moving between the two adjacent rooms. We have had similar arrangements elsewhere (Paris, Rome), which worked well because the internal doors could be left open when needed, but at The James this is not possible because the internal doors cannot be held open. Tying the door handle to the cupboard handle with a sock in order to hold it open was hardly the sort of solution I expected to have to use in a “luxury boutique hotel” (although it worked quite effectively).Taking into consideration the cost per night, the rooms are very small – the standard queen even qualifies as minute – although we got used to it eventually. There is a paucity of cupboard space, no carpets, and the bathrooms are functional if not overly large or aesthetic. On the whole, rather a spartan décor - but the beds were definitely comfortable and the rooms are well maintained and spotlessly clean. Quite a bit of noise from the corridor at night. A welcome plus is free WIFI throughout the hotel, a pleasant change from the daily rates charged in most hotels. Service was courteous, efficient and responsive. All our requests were handled promptly. The Concierge was helpful and friendly, and a special thanks must go to Eric the Doorman, who acted swiftly to avert disaster and very quickly arranged alternative transport when our car service failed to arrive to take us to a show (Book of Mormon, no less).Public facilities are rather meager, the lobby lounge is a bit nondescript, but the gym is well equipped and located on the 17th floor giving a great view. The lounge/bar on the top floor was packed every time we ventured up there, it seems like a popular evening venue. Unfortunately the weather was still rather chilly so we did not get to enjoy the outdoor facilities, although the “plunge pool” on the roof is precisely what it says it is.Location is good, somewhat on the edge of Soho’s shopping district, but still within easy walking distance, as is Greenwich Village nearby. Proximity to the entrance to Holland Tunnel causes quite severe traffic congestion in the area during peak hours. There are a lot of excellent restaurants in the vicinity, and the concierge was very helpful in that regard. The David Burke Kitchen which is in the basement of the hotel (a “partner” venture), offers meals to house guests including breakfast. It was not really to my personal liking, but the cuisine was certainly of good quality.In conclusion, what the James lacks in space and comfort, it makes up in excellent service. However, the overall experience somehow lacks the “wow” factor that I believe one is entitled to expect from a facility which markets itself as a luxury hotel.","Giv'atayim, Israel","MAEL3010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Giv'atayim, Israel</strong>",20,4.0

I am lying in a comfortable bed, looking out huge windows facing was on its 9th floor. What could possibly be wrong?Little things. But lots and lots of them. Pillows - ordered pillows from the menu in the room. Got the wrong pillows delivered. asked for the write pillows. got more of the wrong pillows. showed the book to the man. told me that they were out of them. got a call saying ""we can purchase them tomorrow if you want us to"". I said ""why are you asking me? am I supposed to be guilty about the fact that you have to purchase what you are offering as part of the James experience?"" Came back to room the next afternoon. Still no pillows...A list: lots of room noise from above (maybe the lack of carpet to sound damp?) low water pressure in shower. you wait forever for an elevator because there are only 2! Coffee and pastries does not mean a selection of pastries, but a pile of a single mediocre pastry. My key did not allow me to take the elevator to the roof at 5:30PM, as promised. Housekeeping weird - didn't put away iron and ironing board. Why would I want it left out? Duvet cover had chocolate stains (I hope thats what they were...). Used dental floss on counter not thrown away - did they think I intended to reuse it? (yes, I should have thrown it away myself...) No greeting from concierge on arrival. No doorman ever. AC blows directly on bed. TV picture too dark, and remote does not allow you to adjust it. No channel guide for cable TV - only channel list. I've been searching for that perfect NYC boutique-ish hotel in the Soho area. I've stayed at the Mondrian Soho a half dozen times and thought I would try some where else - the Mondrian's standards are slipping a bit. I want to be delighted for less than $500 a night.

Whilst we did enjoy the stay and the facilities and location are excellent, the attitude of the staff was a real let down to an otherwise excellent experience.

The bartender in the treehouse bar was rude, on our first night we were tired and hungry from our long flight and we waited over 20 minutes to be served as he was watching ice hockey on a massive tv. We also found that the staff in the sky lobby were unable to help with most things such as general info about soho and directions to local places which you would expect.

I LOVE the location. Close to a ton of fun bars and restaurants and SHOPPING. Also close to public transport. Do not try to get here on a Friday night though as the traffic to the tunnel will be such that you will have to get out of your taxi and WALK for blocks and blocks with your suitcase.I also loved the design of the rooms. Everything was very comfortable and well thought-out. There was even an extension cord for my all devices!!!! And free wifi all the time, although at times it was slow to non-existent. (Note, there is a shade you can control from the bathroom that will separate the sleeping area from the bathroom.) Also LOVED the bath products tremendously.But here are the things that happened while I was there, some controllable, some not:Down to one guest elevator. Whoever designed the hotel elevator system was not an expert in expressing guests to their rooms. The two elevators were slow enough as it was. Imagine what happened when the service elevator went out and the staff had to use the guest elevators. I started timing the elevator on my floor and would often wait 7 minutes for the lift, although one would arrive repeatedly during this time with the guy with the cart with all the empty glass water bottles, jingling. This was a bit of a mess. (And he was not the world's most happiest person.)The fight in the hotel room above me. So bad that at 2:30 am that I had to call the front desk. Not the hotel's fault at all. But the fight went on for ages and ages. (I really wish she had taken her high heels off.) I should have called sooner. If I've ever felt bystander apathy before, it was now. Did everyone really wait so long to call the front desk??Overbooking via Expedia. One evening, every time I showed up in the lobby, someone was crying. The hotel had been overbooked by Expedia. (Not their fault, I am hoping.) But what was the hotel's fault was the quality and quantity of their communication with the affected guests. As I was enjoying the free wine and cheese, I watched a few different groups of guests just sit there for ages, just waiting and waiting for information about their rebooking. Very binary transactions. I don't know...I just feel like the hotel could have been more caring and provided these guests with more updates. The craziest thing that happened was one afternoon, as I was waiting for the elevator (!!! see above), mindlessly thumbing my iPhone, a cleaning person approached me and told me their name and asked me to make sure I mentioned them on TripAdvisor. :(Oh lastly...had lunch at David Burke the day I checked out and the service was pretty flaky. I was meeting a friend there and we both told them that and they sat us separately, which was pretty funny GIVEN THERE WAS ONLY ONE OTHER TABLE SEATED. Also one server, while kind, had a noticeable body odor problem. So...a little dysfunctional, this stay at The James. But I'd still go back.","London, United Kingdom","kristainlondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",266,4.0

It had been awhile since my last trip to NYC so I asked for a higher-level floor and as such, was upgraded to a deluxe king. The view to the river was fantastic. The room itself was very clean, mod and functional and, most important to me, very quiet. As with most hotel rooms in the city, it was on the small side and would have been cramped with more than one person. My only other complaint is the time it took to locate all the light switches (and there are many). I was very tired the first night so it was a bit aggravating to have to hunt them down. But not enough to take away from the amazing service I received, whether from the front desk, the concierge, the doorman, or room service. When the server brought dinner to my room and I commented that I had come in too late to take advantage of the wine served in the lobby, he returned in a flash with a complimentary bottle! So thoughtful. The bathroom was surprisingly spacious and well-designed. There is a motorized curtain (with some very cool artwork imposed on it) that separates the glass wall between bed and bath, unlike some hotel rooms I've seen that don't give you that option. In addition to room service, I had a late breakfast at David Burke Kitchen downstairs - excellent food and service.While this was a quick business trip, I hope to return to The James again when I have the luxury of more time.

The most glaring example to me is the lobby on the 2nd(?) floor, there is very little in way of guidence for one to know that unless you are already on the elevator (which by the way is also hard to figure out as there is more than one when you walk in and little to tell you you are on the wrong elevator) The first impression of the hotel fo me was not welcoming, just a bare cold lobby with invisible direction. The guy at the door should have provided some assitance but alas, we hauled our bags onto the elevateor with other people only to find it didnt take us were we wanted to go. And hey, I'm GOOD with direction. This was just too minimalist were it needn't be. I get the cool factor that some hotels don't even put the name on the front, but geez, where do I check in after a long trip?In the early afternoon we called ahead to see if our room would be ready, they said not til after 3. Fine. So at 4, after finally finding the (tiny) checkin desk, we are told the room is still not ready, given a card for a free drink downstairs (which elevator is that again?) and we enjoy a wonderful cocktail. One drink and an hour later the room is still not ready so we enjoy another fine drink. An hour and $52 later the room is still not ready so we leave the bags at the tiny desk and head out into wonderful Soho. A call an hour later later has the info our room is 'almost' ready and probably will be by the time we get back. Geez i need a shower. At 7 we head to the hotel and finally get a room and 30mins to shower and dress for a dinner.

Our first stay was so wonderful that we brought our teenage daughters this time. We've sent several friends to stay here. We live in the NY area, and are both native New Yorkers. We came for winter break to be tourists in our own city. The James is located at the bottom of Soho just above Canal St., but you would never know that when you enter the hotel in Grand St. It feels rather private. The second floor lobby adds to that feeling. Also, since there is no direct route to the rooms from the street level, it adds some security. The elevator requires you use your key to enter a floor number. The girls had their own room and I wasn't worried about their safety. If you are a downtown person you can't beat the location. Soho to the northeast, TriBeCa due south, Chinatown southeast. For those who want to travel further afield, two subways within a couple of blocks, as well as busses and cabs.The Rooms: All rooms have nice views. Request a room that faces south so you can see the Freedom Tower (almost finished). Yes, the rooms are small, but this is NYC folks! The rooms are modern and nicely equipped. Beautiful dark wood cabinetry and floors. Cool lighting. The beds are amazingly comfortable! So are the pillows. Then there is the bathroom. The shower has a really luxurious rainfall head (I have one at home, but it's not this fabulous). Some rooms have heated tile floors. The bathroom has a glass wall with a shade, that has an artistic image, for privacy. Our girls found that fun. Shampoo, conditioner, lotion...lovely. The Staff: Very friendly and welcoming. Michael, Michael, Michael! Michael from In-room Dining, shines! Yes, we love him that much. He started our days with a smile. Since it was vacation and it was cold, we decided to treat ourselves to room service breakfast in the mornings. Seeing Michael first thing in the morning was a great way to start the day. He's friendly, sweet, knowledgable, helpful...a great guy! I'm going to miss when we leave today. Camille from housekeeping is another keeper. My husband had a gout attack and when I mentioned it to her she shortly came to our room with a pile of towels, plastic bags and buckets full of ice. The front desk staff were also lovely. I believe that all we had to do was ask and whatever we wanted would appear graciously.The Food: David Burke, no complaints, though the restaurant is not as polished as David Burke Townhouse.

Not the first thing you want to see in your hotel room. We paid additional for an upgraded room, a corner king ""studio,"" which was only slightly larger than the king bed. The room was well appointed but, again, nothing special. We visited the rooftop bar after dinner and enjoyed a drink. The bar feels very separate from the hotel itself so it doesn't really feel like it is part of the property; we did not dine in the restaurant on the ground floor but, again, because it is not really ""connected"" to the hotel lobby it is more of a stand alone. The receptionist touted the morning coffee and pastries at check-in so I returned to the lobby the following morning. And found a very paltry counter with a coffee thermos and small tray with 2 straggler pastries on it; you would certainly find a more impressive spread at a Courtyard Marriott for $89 per night. If you are traveling to New York you can do much, much better than The James. With the ever expanding number of downtown, hipster hotels there are numerous offerings in the area with so much more, particularly for the price.","Westport, Connecticut","WalkerWine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Westport, Connecticut</strong>",59,3.0

They also arranged for us to have simultaneous massages in our room(as there is no spa) early evening, which were fantastic and perfect after a day in the city. We arrived on the Thursday (had dinner at Freemans-1 Freemans Alley with friends-again couldn't fault the food and great buzzy place) with lots of 'historical storm on its way' talk from the locals with recommendations not to go out after 8pm on the Friday evening. We did however have a few drinks in Jimmy's rooftop bar and then ventured across the road to Cafe Noir which is a cosy tapas bar with delicious food and stumbling distance home! Hotel location was ideal, close to Broadway with mainstream shops but lots of boutiques on side streets. Saturday the city was covered in snow and looked stunning. Having left 2 children at home we wanted the hotel to be trendy, but not too cool, in a great location and this fitted the bill. Service was pretty good, room (corner suite on 9th floor) was a good size with a superb shower.

I stayed at The James with my husband in Sept/Oct 2012. This was a very special visit to New York as we were there to get married. I had informed the hotel of this beforehand as I needed some recommendations on florists in the area. We arrived at 2pm which is the official check in time and were told that our Corner King Studio room was not ready because they wanted to make some extra special touches to the room for us due to the fact that we were in NYC to get married. They suggested that we wait in the rooftop bar until our room was ready. An hour later we went back to reception and were told again that they were still trying to make the room extra special. We were told that the front desk would call us as soon as the room was ready so we decided to explore Soho a little. Another hour later we still hadn't heard anything so we called the front desk only to be told that the room still wasn't ready. Eventually 10 mins later we got the call and went back to the front desk to collect our keys and officially check in. By this time we were pretty tired but everyone who we dealt with so polite and we felt that their intentions were good so we didn't feel the need to make a fuss. When we got to the room everything was fine but we didn't see why we were made to wait over 2 hours for our room to be ready as there were no 'special touches' evident. Whilst we would never expect anything complimentary just because we were there to get married, it was annoying that they had used the excuse that the room was not ready because they were doing something extra for us when in fact it just simply wasn't cleaned/serviced until over 2 hours after the official check in time. They should have said that the room wasn't ready rather than using our wedding as an excuse. Positives-The Staff. Everyone we encountered was extremely polite and helpful. The concierge team did a great job with recommending an amazing florist, organising a dinner in a nearby Soho restaurant for friends and family the day before the wedding and with arranging transport on the actual wedding day. A special mention to Morgan who answered all emails prior to our stay very promotly.-Corner King Studio room had amazing views of downtown Manhattan. It was very spacious and worth the additional rate.-Comfy beds-Powerful and large shower with organic toiletries supplied-Complimentary filtered water was a nice touch as were the cookies and chocolates at turn down.-Wide choice of breakfast included in the room rate on an in room dining basis only. -Room service was always prompt-Overall feel of the place and contemporary decor made the hotel a very relaxing environment.-David Burke Kitchen. We dined there in the evening on one occasion and the food was delicious.-Jimmys bar. Yes the service was a little arrogant but with the view and the delicious cocktails, who cares? -Complimentary car service/bikes for hire. We didn't use this but thought it was a nice touch.-Complimentary coffee and pastries in the morning and wine and cheese in the evening.-Lots of outdoor space-Location. Close to the subway and the fantastic restaurants and shops in Soho.Negatives-The lifts got quite busy in the evenings due to non-residents using the same lifts to get to Jimmys Bar.

The room was clean, neat and very well-designed for its compact size. The hotel is relatively new and while we raised the average age, we always felt welcome at all times. All the hotel staff were friendly and very helpful. The staff were quick to brave the cold to hail cabs and on a number of occasions confirmed restaurant bookings and other related matters.The hotel is about 100 metres from a Metro train station (for the Red 1 line), while access to stations for another Metro line are also within an easy walking distance. While the hotel’s address is on Grand Street it is effectively on the corner of 6th Avenue and Grand Street, which makes securing cabs a relatively painless exercise.The hotel’s restaurant (David Burke) was excellent and the need for a reservation at night was proof of its popularity. We also ate close by on a number of occasions (the Lucky Strike Restaurant and Cipriani Downtown). Balthazar (excellent) for brunch is also within an easy walking distance.

That may be true but it is also way less expensive. One has to compare hotels at the same price point. I had many issues upon arrival and also with the state of the room....many of the features were not working and it had not been readied for guests properly. At first the hotel was slow to correct this. However when I contacted management they put everything in order very quickly. Judging by the other reviews on here I have to assume that my problems with things not working in the room was just an unfortunate fluke that can happen in hotels and as I stated it was ultimately handled well.Every single staff member I came into contact with was just lovely. With the exception of upon my arrival when there was no one at the door, no porters and reception did not seem to care everyone else really went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. I had a few meals in The David Burke Restaurant which was very very good. Room service was very good for breakfast with an insanely fresh and very nicely sized fruit plate. Room service dinner was hit or miss....great one day and then way way too salty by any standard the next. That's odd because I presume it comes from The David Burke Restaurant but maybe the foray into the salt mines was also a fluke.The coffee and scones in the lobby that as many reviewers have noted changes to water and fruit, then wine and cheese and finally cookies is more than a nice touch. It really creates a very nice atmosphere.I also really like that they give filtered water in bottles in the room. The bedding was terrific as was the bed. Nice mini bar. There was no price list in my room and I looked everywhere so I can't comment on cost but they had very good items. Judging by my bill I think the cost was probably in line with similar hotels in NYC. I am not a fan of furniture that elevates form over function. To this extent I did not feel that the round table and modern but not terribly comfortable chair in the room was a good substitute for a desk. However this was more than made up for by the fact that where they have the free food station in the lobby lounge they also have computers and a printer free of charge and comfy sofas and chairs with views through surrounding windows of the area. Essentially you get a biz center instead of a desk but you don't have to pay for it. They even offered me coffee one day when I was working there after coffee service and brought it to me free of charge.The area is terrific. Shops, restaurants and a subway right there. The rooms are small so be prepared. I had a corner king and the bathroom was big but that did take away from rest of the room. I have stayed at many many hotels in NYC.

Comments about it's size is true but it was a reasonable size for NYC and so wonderfully decorated that it was just so great to enjoy all the amenities.My daughter was just mesmerized by the shower and bathroom.

The shower itself was a rain shower design and the organic beauty products provided for free were wonderful.The room attendant took great care cleaning and freshening the room each day. David Burke's restaurant was great but geared towards those who like very spicy comfort food. The service was impeccable. Another perk was the house car that is available to drive you to your destination for free (of course we tipped the driver). The driver was so polite and kind and took us all the way to our Broadway play since no one was waiting for him at the hotel and the concierge told him it was okay.

Before Sandy hit we got note from management re-assuring us that the hotel had generators and not to be concerned, but to keep the curtains drawn. When the power did go off on Monday evening we found the generators were severely lacking - lights in the fire escape and corridors only, no power or lights to rooms, no lifts, and most importantly no water. We must commend the staff, all pulled together to move as many people as possible to hotels with power, on Tuesday. Taxis were not to be found and for blocks there were no traffic lights or police controlling traffic. The staff drove us themselves in their own cars, for which we are truely grateful. The hotel they moved us to initially seemed nice, though the attitude was condescending. However there was obviously a mix up of some sort, the new hotel thought we were going back to the James the next day, the James thought we were there for the rest of our stay (another 2 nights).

If it was urgent I was asked to walk five blocks to buy one (It was snowstorm in NY this day) After two hours and several calls still no adapter. I was now running out of battery and had to stop the conf call. I was upset now and called back but no reaction. When I 15 min later was furious, called and asked them to send someone ""to buy 20 adapters for the hotel and I pay for them"" it was some action.

After sending in a serious complaint after horrendous stay to GM, all I got was a one line reply by assistant front-desk employee and USD 50 to spend on food on my next stay?! No way! I would say, brace yourself for the party weekends, not being listened to and overpaying.

We were there in August for 4 nights for my sister's wedding....so we booked multiple rooms at a group rate. My sister and her husband had a beautiful suite on the top floor, it had a separate living room area and it was very spacious, but expensive. We were in a corner room on the 9th floor...our room had an adjacent room for my parents with a little private foyer separating the rooms. This was the perfect set-up for us because we could store the baby stroller in the foyer each night. Or we could leave our doors open but close the main door that lead out to the hallway. The rooms were small but bright and I loved the bathroom and all of the products they supplied. In addition, the nightly turn-down service was a really nice touch. We always got different gourmet chocolates left next to the bed, and extra bottles of filtered water.The staff was extremely helpful throughout our entire stay. They knew our group, and allowed us to reserve the terrace of the treehouse one evening for an ""after-rehearsal-dinner party"". They also reserved the treehouse for our brunch the morning after the wedding. Upon arrival, when my parents' room was not ready, they offered a credit at the David Burke restaurant. We all ate there and had a wonderful meal. Top notch food, drinks, and service. The room service food was good too, we had a complimentary continental breakfast each morning.In addition to the nice rooms and service, the hotel itself is really cool, beautiful and different. The lobby is simple but has a cool glass elevator to access it. The garden areas are amazing, and you can eat/drink out there or just relax. Finally the rooftop bar is really nice and the pool deck. Both are small but sufficient for downtown NYC. The views are magnificent.The location of the hotel was perfect. The concierge and doorman were very helpful in directing you where to go and recommending restaurants and other things to do in the area.Finally, after leaving the hotel, they sent me a survey. When I told them that my room service breakfast did not arrive one morning (you can conveniently leave your order on a hanging menu on your doorknob) they responded immediately with a very nice and thoughtful email, offering me a credit to the restaurant and an invitation to visit the hotel again.

Took ages to decide on The James and was looking for somewher that offered a bit of personality as well as good location and high quality rooms. Overall The james ticked these boxes. Rooms were well furnished and my deluxe king was adequate for one and probably squeezy for two if you have lots of luggage. Beds sensational bathroom shower good. I had paid for deluxe because it offered higher floor ( with views) but on checkin was given a lower floor with no view and quite dark. Request to move was unable to be met that night but was moved next day. Hotel has small guest area in foyer that offers basic tea/ coffee and pastry in morning. Staff were pleasant and answered requests promptly but they werent looking to offer assistance. Some were not as knowledgeable as they should be when informing visitors of attravtions, sights to see. Used the free area car service once and this was great service. Rick the driver was really helpful. However dont rely on this being available as they werent able to offer if on two other requests.Doorman Christopher set the tone for really impressive welcome but sadly some of his colleagues were less than pleasant and quite off hand. Cant comment on restaurant but couple of room service meals were ok however menu could do with few more light and healthy options. One visit to the rooftop bar was enough. It was crowded with younger set, and not comfortable for a solo traveller. Location is noisy, busy and a real eclectic mix of high end shops mixed in with low end cheap and cheerful. It is interesting but a bit gritty. Transport options make getting around pretty easy.

Rooms were clean and spacious (for New York stardards). Was not at all impressed by the service: concierge on the ground floor never greets guests (although they see you walking pass they act like they do not see you) or will not open doors. Does it take so much to offer a better service? It's not that we are talking about a 2* hotel here and the hotel is quite pricey.There were some good points at the hotel: we received a complimentary later check-out (but the downside was that the cleaner knocked on our room 5 times from 1.00-2.00 which was extremely annoying since we wanted to shower before our long flight).

She was very informative about the soup of the day- Lobster. I wanted a hamburger, but with frittes. She easily substituted and asked how I wanted it done.

He wasn't just polite and helpful, he was charming and funny too and stood out head and shoulders over anyone else.The room is compact - but this is New York, if you're spending too long in your room you have a problem - there's plenty to go and do!! There was ample space for us and my overpacking and ton of cosmetics. We had a corner room 1109. The views were spectacular and it was so quiet. The bed is really comfortable, the bedding is really luxurious and gave us both great sleep!!The bathroom - it was a bathroom, luxuriously furnished so can't complain. They have shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the shower, all organic products with a really zesty/herby fragrance perfect for waking you up.Complimentary tea and coffee in the room and also in the lobby with scones. I did read a review when someone complained about the coffee and pastry's in the lobby??? It's free how can you complain - no one is forcing you to eat/drink it! However the savoury scone was really tasty!The lobby is nice and relaxed and is equipped with 2 mac's which were great for us to check in online for our return flight.The location - great, really close to restaurants, bars, galleries and boutiques. FAR FAR away from the jam packed sidewalks and tacky souvenir shops, it felt relaxed and friendly and welcoming a far cry from our last visit.I have read reviews where people said they weren't acknowledged much. Well we weren't either, but I really preferred it that way. There were always staff present who were more than happy to help, but I don't need someone to constantly follow me around and want to do everything for me or kiss my behind for me just for renting a room. They were laid back, relaxed and professional.I have to say Jimmy was a bit of a let down. The view is great, the pool as someone else mentioned is more of an ornamental bath. I think it just doesn't fit with the rest of the hotel, the hotel is effortless and the staff are just really pleasant... but up there, well the bar tender was just plain rude. He had an attitude and we witnessed 2 heated exchanges over just 2 drink. It felt so different, like really pretentious actually and that was just the staff! Maybe I just thought they would be like the hotel staff, actually I hoped they would be like Chris (I hope his name was Chris) We did however get to witness a beautiful sunset from the terrace which made the cocktails worth their price.Next time, if I get chance to go back to NY, I would stay at The James, but I would stay clear of Jimmy.",UK,"lcstreet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>UK</strong>",57,5.0

I went to the reception to ask for matches (or a lighter to borrow) they did not have any, went to the restaurant same thing, then went to the bar…no matches no lighter…I mean come on (how do you light you candles?!)! I know that it’s a non-smoking building but a 5 stars hotel could at least have matches or anything that would help you light a cigarette since they have a special terrace where you can smoke!

We paid $500 a night, so when the bathroom sink clogged (and stayed that way) for two days and I had to repeatedly call for hand towels (all this AFTER the room had been made up) I began to think we made a mistake. Also, the bar on the roof has become popular and on Saturday night we could hear the party up there until well after midnight. The staff is friendly enough, especially the door men. The continental breakfast is nothing more than two (pump) thermos coffee dispensers and a plate of small scones. We had to ask the staff when the coffee and scones were gone, which was quite often. They also advertise that fresh fruit is served every afternoon....this is a bowl of oranges or apples.We probably would not choose this hotel again.","Lincoln, Nebraska","Macmusey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lincoln, Nebraska</strong>",15,2.0

It's quite trendy with artworks on all floors and has a nice garden a level up from the street. The bar on the top floor is a nice place to hang out but don't expect too much in the way of service...and the plastic glasses are a little downmarket (I understand about the pool area). The pool, if you are planning to use it, is better described as a large ornamental bath...good for hopping into but that is it. The rooms are well enough appointed but quite compact (not ridiculously so) and the walls are quite thin. The hotel's dog friendly ...which is great for dogs and their owners...not good if you are within barking or snuffling distance.

We've both been to a fair number of the stylish options but this is currently our favourite. We won't go into detail on the decor etc, suffice to say it's imaginative where it needs to be, it works and doesn't try too hard. One of the great things here is the place isn't trying to force its concept on you the way a place like the Ace does. this trip was for pleasure but we'll both return for business no doubt. They coped very well with our determined pleasure seeking, even being kind and chatty when we went down to the terrace in various states of disarray and at various unspeakable times of the night. Truly it's the staff that make this place. And what it is is a canavas for your own ideas and needs in New York City. If you're after a quiet night in after a loud one out it's calm and comforting, in other moods it's the perfect springboard to more energetic times. The reason for all this is the staff. Whoever does the recruiting is a genius and we left with warm fondness for all the people we interfaced with; Mike, Jessica, CJ, Chris, Alfie. We've already planned our next stay - Thursday 13th and my regular New York business haunt of 10 years The Bowery has been supplanted, all because of the warm welcome we had at The James.

Let me just say that it was a wonderful visit but had a few very minor hiccups. First impression was good. I don't like modern and really loved the ""look"" of the hotel. You walk in street level but that's the bellman's desk. Had no idea that check in was two levels up. No signs and upon arrival the desk was unmanned so a staff member happen to walk by and showed us where to go. I must say staff is incredibly NICE, polite, courteous, across the board. Check-in was smooth and quick. We were early but were still accommodated which was great.The lobby is nice. They have two computers and a printer that you can use. There are comped refreshments throughout the day - scones and coffee in the AM, wine and cheese in the PM.The Urban Garden is phenomenal! Loved it! There are three separate sitting areas. A lower loungey area with couches. An upper level with cabanas and tables for dining and then the bar area with high boys off to the side. Wish we had more time to have a couple meals there but we just had drinks. I imagine it gets very busy for dinner.The Rooftop views are fantastic. The ""pool"" is tiny and unimpressive but Jimmy's (the bar at the rooftop) is still a cool place to hang out. If you stay at the hotel, you can put your name on the list so you can get in hassle free after 9PM.Room: Tastefully appointed. Views were pretty awesome. Bed was WAY too soft for me. Closet had a lot of room. The bathroom has a glass wall separating it from the room. There is a screen that blocks the ""view"" but still see silhouettes so please consider if you're bunking with friends or work colleagues. Rainfall shower head was AMAZING! Amenities aren't little bottles but big refillable bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash. Nice touch for me. Also get the NY-triple-filtered tap water in a bottle free of charge. They come to clean rooms late in the day (5/6pm) so plan accordingly. Turn down was done and chocolates left (with wrappers on - see previous review).Here comes my ONE con - the parking. Hotel reservations are done through a central location that handles both NY and Chicago. I asked about parking. The rep said it was $55 - per DAY - (outrageous in general, pretty norm for NY I guess) no in/out privileges. She neglected to mention that the price depends on the kind of car. We rented a Jeep Grand Cherokee (SUV) and apparently there is an upcharge of $10 per day for a bigger car! Granted that is only $20 more but it still pissed me off. Right hand should know what left hand is saying/doing. The front desk was polite but bc it is a ""third-party"" garage there was little they could do about the charge. They were nice enough to upgrade us to a king corner. Still super annoyed.Hotel: Very modern, boutique hotel with personality, green as in environ-friendly, clean, small rooms but this is NY folks and I am not part of the 1% to pay for the extra SF. Has the David Burke restaurant (highly rated) is a HUGE plus.Staff: Courteous, super-nice, knowledgeable about practically everything I inquired about.Location: It's on the edges of SoHo just North of TriBeCa. Close to the subway stop that takes you directly to the Empire State Building or South to the 9/11 memorial.It is very unfortunate that if we ever come back to NY we'll be bringing our 3 little (under 8) kids and probably not going to be staying at The James. It's just not conducive for little ones.

I was so close to staying at the trump soho oh how I wish I had the decision to make all over again.P.S. If the manager responds to this please do not bother trying to offer a free room upgrade along with a discount on dinner at your restaurant for my next stay.

We usually stay on the upper west side but wanted to try a new area. I was staying in two locations because of a business meeting; the first three days I was at the Standard (Meatpacking district) and the subsequent four days we elected to stay at the James. Both hotels are relatively new but our stay at the James was significantly better. The James manages to successfuly integrate modern design without sacrificing the comforts and service that one often seeks when traveling. We were staying in one of the corner kings which I highy recommend. The layout of the room, the lighting and the details make the room feel much more spacious than the actual square footage. The rooms alone would convince me to stay at the James; however, the real amentiies at the James relate to the multi-level garden environment at the lower levels and the rooftop bar and pool. Both provide a relaxing escape from the pace of NYC - especially the garden. We had drinks and dinner out there and it was fantastic. I wish that the terrace/garden was available more frequently for dining - that is my only negative critique of the hotel. Finally, the staff at the James is extraordinary. Whether it was helping us get checked in, accomodating our room needs, finding cabs or attending to our specific requests, the staff was friendly and helpful - houskeepers, conceirege, service staff and bellhops always greeted us with a smile and an offer of assistance. We will definitley be staying at the James the next time we travel to NYC.","Denver, Colorado","Paul H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",2,5.0

The James is simply amazing.We (my fiancee and I) decided, on a whim, to go to New York for a week. No one mentioned it would be the best experience of our lives.Our crazy cab-ride from JFK introduced us to the busiest city in the world, and we arrived at the hotel and were greeted by a very friendly man who, in England, could pass as a passionate hotel manager. He was just the bag-man. We were checked in by the polite and helpful desk staff, and then sent to our room, which needs a new paragraph.I'm running out of superlatives, but we were blown away by the quality of the accommodation. Our agent in the UK had said this was a 4*, but the James is easily as good as a 6*, right down to the unique artwork in the corridors and little touches like comfy pillows! The bathroom is very nice, with lovely smelling products to use. We were left alone by the attentive staff to settle in, but it was a nice surprise to find a hand-written note welcoming us to New York.The bed (can't remember if it was queen or king) was huge, and very comfortable, and we both enjoyed a lovely night's sleep after eating at a restaurant recommended by the desk. You MUST order breakfast from the hotel - not because there is nothing on offer (pastries in the lobby), but because it is extremely tasty, and innovative for a hotel to offer such well presented.I could go on and on about the friendly staff, the clean room, the comfort, the style, convenient location and did I say friendly staff? They're helpful too!

As a relative 'newcomer' to the New York hotel scene we chose The James based on its central SoHo location and were intrigued to see if it was a good as all the reviewers say! For such a large hotel it still feels quite intimate. Service at every point during our stay (with the exception of breakfast one morning) was first class from the moment we stepped out the cab (charming door men) through to check in, with staff helpful and courteous throughout. We had drinks in Jimmy’s every night, and even though we entered after 9pm - when the bar is no longer accessible from the guest hotel elevator - we were given immediate access and didn’t have to queue with non guests. Perhaps not the most inexpensive bar in town, but worth the premium for the views and ambience. On our first night we decided to dine in at David Burke Kitchen - terrific food, buzzy atmosphere and just a short stroll to the elevator and our comfy bed...perfect. When booking we debated on whether to upgrade on the room and opted for a Corner King Studio room. I’m glad we did as this afforded us a great city views from its sleek modern and fully equipped interior. Sadly, it was just too cold to use the roof garden space, but we shall have to return in the spring to play some crocket on the lawn! Another plus was the complimentary coffee and pastries served in the Lobby, nice little touch that belies the size of the hotel....smaller ‘boutique’ hotels should take note. A perfect stay, aside from the poor service we received at breakfast one morning...down to one particular member of staff who disappeared for long periods of time (20mins) and didn’t offer us refills or appear particularly bothered in providing a service, which was made all the more apparent by the efficiency and professionalism of his colleagues. Shame. But despite this ‘hiccup’, we would return.

We got back yesterday. We only stayed in The James for a day but it was one of the better experiences of our trip. To be greeted with a genuinely (if he'd been practising then he should be on Broadway) enthusiastic and proud, ""Welcome to The James"" by the doorman who lugged our bags to reception asking of our trip and where we'd come from. It was the Hotel Americano as it happens and, to our surprise, this chap actually knew where Sweden was (not Switzerland, Americano!). A nice start. The services manager checked us in nice and swiftly, with no word of incidentals (which is great) and free internet, which we expect being Swedes. There's free coffee and pastries in the morn, water and fruit in the afternoon and some cheese and wine in the eve, a nice touch, while the rooftop bar has cracking views and a suitably arrogant bar man. Room was spacious, bathroom had the plats du jour glass wall (seriously, this has to stop) and the view, again from our 15th floor room was great. Also well insulated from noise from the bar at the roof or hallway noise. Concierge was exceptional. We asked in the previous hotel for a table at the Hudson Clearwater and came up with nothing. Apparently (as my wife spied) The James prides itself on having decent contacts and, about an hour after asking, we had our reservation. Was an interesting experience but not sure if it's really a boutique hotel. Too large and a little soulless but as a luxury hotel it's a good one with all the bits in the right places but I would be tempted to agree with others that emphasis must be placed on hotel guests where bar access is concerned.

This time, the weather forecast was predicting extreme heat so we made made the foolish decision to try and find an alternative hotel that has an outdoor pool area. We chose the James based on this and the location. We actually booked some kind of poolside package so that we had reserved seating by the pool (didn't happen). The package also included a massage. If you book a massage at this hotel don't, whatever you do, choose to have it at the 'spa cabana'. This is basically an army tent on the lower roof deck (second floor) which is boiling hot. Due to being in a tent in the middle of NYC it was basically like having a massage in the middle of the street with all the accompanying beeping horns and ambulance sirens. Good things about this hotel: The restaurant. Food great. Roof garden (different from the roodtop pool) was beautiful.The rooftop pool: Great but very limited seating and absolutely no shade. The staff up there seemed very confused about what food we were or were not allowed to order. They said the rules keep changing.The locationBad things about this hotel:The lobby bar was pretty much the only communal area that felt integrated into the hotel. It had seating for 10 people and was just soulless. This may well be a taste thing though. As I said, we absolutely love the Greenwich which is just totally different.Our room was TINY and just had absolutely no character or interest whatsoever apart from a strange screen which divided the bathroom and the bedroom!All in all, despite the sunshine, and the slight price difference, we very much regret not sticking to what we know!","London, United Kingdom","thehappyone</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",78,3.0

But that wasn't a problem for us as the hotel was well worth it without that and with so much to see and do in NYC there wouldn't have been time to enjoy it anyway.

Our corner room was modern with a large bathroom with rainshower/handheld combo and all amenities and ice cold A/C; really needed on the 90 degree day. On the 6th floor there was no street noise. We visited the pool area at different times of day and night but enjoyed it best in the morning before it was open to ""Jimmys"" bar -- that scene was strange by our standards. Very difficult to get a drink yet everyone seemed intoxicated. We headed up at sunset in the hopes of drinks with a view but couldn't get near the bar or find a space on the roof.

Twice in two days an order (or part order) was forgotten. To be fair, they were very apologetic and offered the food on the house, but I did hear one of the staff explaining to a guest who was requesting a special order at the poolside that it was best to keep it simple as the communication wasn’t always the best, so it sounds as though there is an ongoing issue. I’m not sure why this is, as the service in the garden and the main restaurant is spot on.

The majority of the staff at the James are terrific: courteous, friendly and knowledgable. Michael Daniels on breakfast service was particularly professional and took the time to engage with us about our trip. He clearly has a thorough knowledge of New York City and its best venues and locations. The James would possibly make better use of his skills as a concierge (this position seemed to be hot-desked and was hit-and-miss in its quality). This wasn't a major issue for us, though.The big issue we had with the James was that when it was good it was excellent, but when it was bad, it was diabolical. I have honestly never experienced such a resentful attitude from hotel staff. There were only one or two bad staff members on the James team, but they completely nullify the best efforts of their colleagues. The rest of the James staff have every right to feel cheated and betrayed by this ruinous minority.The cleaning and room service was shocking. Dirty cups left to pile up, consumables not replenished and the worst possible attitudes. We had to call downstairs EVERY DAY of our stay to tell them things were dirty, missing, not replenished, unfinished etc.On one occasion, guest services brought two clean cups after we informed the hotel that we had no clean ones as the dirty ones had not been cleared.When they arrived, we had this little conversation at the door:Us: ""Can you take these two dirty cups for us?""James Staff (already walking away): ""No. You have to call room service for that, I’m a houseman"".The tone of this member of staff’s voice was unnecessarily forceful and resentful.We made a complaint to the manager of the hotel about this, and she was very apologetic about the shortcomings and the rudeness of her staff. She promised us that all of our needs would be catered for the rest of our stay. Unfortunately, the lack of care and attention to detail continued to the point where we became bored of ringing for a breakfast order form and telling them that they hadn’t cleared away our breakfast cups and replenished the tea and coffee.This, in addition to the shower knob missing from our shower and a blocked sink when we arrived (which were quickly and efficiently rectified) only highlighted that more attention should be spent on the housekeeping.The view from Jimmy's bar is terrific and it's worth going up there before 9pm (before the crowds arrive). But it's not enough to justify a stay at the James.So, we can’t recommend the James and we won’t be going back because it’s just not worth the risk. Lots of terrific staff (as I stated earlier) like Felix, Christopher, Nicole, Michael Daniels and others. I just feel bad for these people that they have colleagues that are severely jeopardising their hotel’s reputation. Finally, charging $40 for a rollaway bed for one of our five nights, that we never requested may have just been an honest mistake. Check your bill at the end of your stay, just like we checked ours, so you don’t pay extra.It’s OK trying to be the coolest hotel in town, but they really need to get the basics right first.","Sheffield, United Kingdom","RyanRoberts</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sheffield, United Kingdom</strong>",2,2.0

Our stay was a pleasure. The staff was courteous and helpful without fail. From the doorman to the front desk to the maid, these folks had been impeccably trained to be polite and friendly.Our room was a corner king on the 9th floor, typically New York-sized, but with a nice view and no noise at all to disturb us. The bed was comfortable and pillows/sheets were top quality. The designer thoughtfully included a privacy shade to cover the bathroom's cool glass wall. The Wi-fi was fast and, best of all, free. They set out wine and cheese in the lobby in the evenings and cookies at night.We enjoyed drinks at the Jimmy (the hotel's popular rooftop lounge) one night and were so glad that The James had no problem adding hotel guests to the VIP list to get in after 9pm. In that respect and many others, we found The James to be the ""un-Standard"", every bit as cool, but with wonderful service and so much more class.My only minor complaint about The James was the in-room dining. Our booking included breakfast and we didn't particularly enjoy it: soggy, limp bacon, soggy toast, ok eggs. I expected much more since the in-room dining is provided by the David Burke restaurant downstairs and would skip this option next time.Otherwise it's a great place to stay. Try it.

Local streets are quiet enough so not overwhelming as some areas could be in the city. Great transport links too.Rooms are good sized and designer chic without being over poweringly design centric and huge windows result in great vistas.

We have stayed in some really very good NYC hotels before so The James had a lot to live up to but it did and more. We booked a flight and hotel package through Virgin whereas normally we choose fights and hotel independently. So despite reading many positive and some other less so, reviews of the hotel, we were a little apprehensive about what we would find. We wanted to base ourselves in SoHo and The James looked in a good position. We flew in and out of Newark and this meant we were dropped off first and collected last on the optional shared hotel shuttle offered by Virgin. That was great as there was no wasted tinme travelling or waiting around either way. OK so what can you expect? Well when you approach The James from the road it isn't very preposessing. On first impressions it looks like an office building but hotel staff doormen were very welcoming in their understated stylish urban (as opposed to military type) unifoms. The ground floor lobby lift goes up to the main reception area a couple of floors above and as you rise you see the raised hotel garden which would look inviting anytime except mid-winter. In the main area there is good lighting and interesting modern furniture and a nice feel to the place. Lots of art books and daily papers provided - a couple of Apple workstations and so on - a comfortable place to while away time on the sofas there. Tip - the leather chairs are great to look at but not so good to sit on. We had paid for an upgrade to a standard king room and emerging from the lift a pleasant corridor with the room doors backlit and walls lined with work by an individual artist on the walls greeted us. The room we had was spot on - we loved it - really the best room we have stayed in, in NYC. It is all dark wood floor and wardrobes etc with light soft furnishings. Really comfortable bed & linens with hip hoorah good stylish and practical wall-hung reading lights and lots of different lighting options in the room. The bathroom was stylish and large and lie everything else in the room well planned and equipped. There's a very spacious walk in shower with both hand held and rainhead options. Good mirrors and excellent lighting - even the option of dimming the lights. A real feature is the full length clear glass partition between the bedroom and the bathroom with a motorised modesty blind (they call it a peekaboo blind!) covered in a lovely tree print. We were I think on something like the 7th floor and this means you get a good view of the bustle below and the traffic heading in and out of the Holland Tunnel. We couldn't have been more comfortable and in the main hotel reception there was morning coffee and buns and early evening, wine was provided. Very pleasant to spend time in the hotel. Not only that but it has a marvellous cocktail bar high at The James right at the top - Jimmy's - which as a guest you get some priority access to. It has great views and excellent music, in good weather there is a small pool outside and rooftop terrace. High at The James is a great place to be! Beneath the hotel is the David Burke Kitchen - a celebrity chef's restaurant and very good unfussy & fun food and excellent service. The James has great room service 24hrs too if you want to eat in. We found all the hotel staff unfailingly polite without being fussy. They were straightforward, friendly and helpful and best of all seemed to genuinely like where they worked. If minor things went wrong or we had any small problems, these were quickly put right and followed up with a call to check our satisfaction. We felt really comfortable and well looked after throughout our 7 day stay. Great location too right by the subway A,C & E lines on Canal St and Spring Street so you can zip pretty much anywhere you want to very easily. The delights of Soho are there right on your doorstep. Would we stay there again? You bet! The James exceeded our expectations and we really enjoyed staying there. Can I find anything to grumble about? No - but I did hear another guest complaining loudly one morning about the heating system being noisey at night....but hey why didn't she say so earlier? Oh yes and joy of joy there was no problem whatsoever about checking out late from The James - our flight back was an evening one. We had the room until about 2.00p.m. on day of departure (on arrival rooms may not be available until after that time). Our cases were looked after at The James whilst we spend a last full day looking around Soho. We are all different but The James really fitted us exactly and we felt it was good value.","London, United Kingdom","johnrichardyoung</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",22,5.0

The lobby is very nicely decorated and we liked to sit there for a while, especially from 6 to 8 pm, then you can have a drink (good wine) and a snack. Also coffee in the mornings.There was only one thing that was disappointing. We had our room on the 17th floor. There you can also find the gym, open 24 hours. So this floor is kind of noisy during the night/morning. People talking, staff talking through their phones, doors slamming. So I would strongly advice to avoid the 17th/highest floor. That is the only reason not giving our stay 5 points.

The hotel and its staff are terrific. The location is outside of the crush of tourist areas but still firmly part of the city. Subways, cabs, busses are all close by for travel to major museums and Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, Bway etc. But there's so much to do in the immediate area, you may find you needn't bother. Fabulous shopping and many fine restaurants with delicious food are within walking distance...we ate at the Little Owl, Mas and the Dutch, which i think was named this year's best restaurant by the NY Times. All easy walking distance...the Dutch is just around the corner. Staff is great - friendly and highly competent.

I was impressed with the facility (minimalist design; original art by different artists displayed in the hallway of each floor; compact but very well-equipped exercise room), the staff and the guest rooms. Of course, the rooms were small, because of the location, but I have never been in a hotel room that was more well-designed (and I travel regularly for business and leisure in the USA and Europe). Room (including bathroom) was VERY clean. Did not eat there, but went to the roof-top bar ""Jimmy's"" (which I understand is owned by a separate group -- not the hotel). Unlike the hotel, it was pretentious and unimpressive. The bartender was rather full of himself and more interested in schmoozing the women at the bar than in providing good service. A weak selection of appetizers & spirits, in what should have been a much higher-end bar. The view, however, was spectacular. I suspect the Jimmy's experience would improve with good friends, and in the Spring-Fall (I was there 1/30-31) when you could use the roof-top deck.

The hotel staff was friendly, engaging and helpful. Their uniforms are very cute. The entry is a little funky. But I attribute it to the building, and they made it interesting. My room was on the smaller side but they made it feel fun and open. It was on the 6th floor with a decent view of the city and close to the elevator. I immediately expected to be troubled all night with elevator noise but gratefully was not. The majority of the noise came from the room above me, I suspect due to the hardwood floors in the rooms. Housekeeping did not knock at the crack of dawn! The room was clean, and i did inspect thoroughly. I personally hate the overhead shower heads that give the ""rain"" effect, so I am glad they had two options. The bathroom has a funky shade that can be raised to allow you to see through the entire glass wall into the bedroom. No worries, you are completely protected when it is down. The mini bar selection is awesome. There is free wifi and an ipod docking station. It is within walking distance to great restaurants, shopping and bars in Soho.

This is a very hip hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. It is in a great part of town and away from all the hustle and bustle. Great shopping and restaurants in the area that are easy to walk to and the hotel is very accessible to the subway--so museums, Time Square, and Central Park are an easy train ride. The breakfast room service and food was fantastic--a definite must to enjoy the views of Lower Manhattan from the comfort of your room. We stayed in a corner King Suite--it was so nice to have lots of windows in the room to enjoy skyline views. The beds are very comfortable and they have various choices of pillows!!! One of our favorite things was the heated floor in the bathroom and the huge rainshower--we definitely felt spoiled. The rooms are very clean with great amenities and you will love the chocolates they put in your room for 'turn down' service.

The concierge was fabulous and the vibe was young, cool and ultra hip. Superb suggestions on places to go, things to see and directions on how to get there. Great decor in the lobby, bars and rooms. The Jimmy (upstairs bar) was great and the rooftop pool while small had plenty of room. Definitely a 'pretty people' place. LOVED the decor of the room and the lobby. The bathroom was gorgeous with glass walls that had automated curtains to allow privacy (or not). Soaps and toiletries were great quality - I ordered some online after I got home. The uniforms were sassy and fun and *so* Soho! New Macs in the lobby allowed for browsing or checking in for flights. Room service was delightful (and available late night) from David Burke's kitchen-and, not a truffle fry was left behind. The Treehouse was packed at night and looked like 'the' place to hang out. Not to be left out - super comfy bed - I even called to find out if they had a brand mattress like some places do that could be purchased. Location was phenom! An easy walk to Cipriani's for bellinis, Balthazar for delightful brunch and a perfect home base for Soho shopping.

Compared to other 'hip' hotels in New York the service really is first class. The staff were always friendly and helpful, with none of the too-cool-for-school nonchalance you can get in some other places. The rooms were comfortable, stylish and well kept. The basics were all taken care of (like wifi, because as far as I am concerned, when you pay USD 350+ a night for a hotel, you should never have to pay for it..!) and the extras like bedtime cookies and a computer area where you can print out documents for free really make you feel like the management care about your stay. When my fiancee left his iPod touch in the room, the hotel posted it back to Switzerland to us with no fuss at all.

Stayed here for 4 nights. It is located in the heart of SoHo and all the shopping. It is literally a block from the Holland Tunnel so if you are travelling - take the Holland and you'll end up seeing The James as soon as you emerge from the tunnel. My experience with The James was memorable. Upon arrival, there was no parking of course, so the guys let me park my car in the limited valet spot for some time until I checked-in and got comfortable. They were very informative telling me about all the amenities that are included with the hotel, places to see and even where to find parking. Besides being my own personal tour guide (even though I was raised in NY), they had something that I've never experienced before. Complimentary food events daily. In the morning from 7AM-11AM, they had free coffee and pastries (which are the best I've tasted). Then later in the afternoon, they offer snacks like fruits. And at night, they offer gourmet chocolate chip cookies (which were also amazing) made by their on-site restaurant called David Burke's Kitchen. The sky lobby is very cool and gives off a lounge feeling for people to in the hotel to mingle. The staff was very friendly and informative. The rooms are VERY small, but that is expected of a New York hotel, but believe me the detail that went into the rooms is phenomenal. The bathroom is crazy and the automatic rolling curtain for the bathroom is the coolest feature I've ever seen. Also, like any high class hotel, they did offer a Lexus RX Hybrid car which I utilized (first-come first take basis).So those were the pros. The reason I gave this hotel a ""Very Good"" rating was because it wasn't perfect. First, there are only 2 true elevators. The glass elevator when you enter the hotel (ground level) only goes up to the sky lobby (which is where you check-in). Then in order to go up to your room you have to take the elevators in the sky lobby to the rooms. The room elevators are accessible from the ground level but you have to walk up some steps and go down the hall to get to them (inconvenient if you have heavy bags or are checking out and have to change elevators in order to bring them down - of course they do offer help in bringing up and down your luggage). Second, the elevators are really slow. At one point I waited 4-5 minutes for the elevators to come. Because there are only 2 elevators, and the hotel was basically sold out, it took forever for elevators to come.Third, the vent in my room was very loud when I turned on the A/C or Heat. I don't know if it was just my room, 706, or if it's like that everwhere. So this only applies to room 706. Fourth, and this was most likely one of those once in a blue moon situation, their service request response was very slow. I requested a fork during my last day of stay and no one came. After 20 minutes, I went downstairs to the sky lobby and asked again. After I went to my room, about 5 minutes later, I got my fork. Then 5 minutes after that, I got another fork. So the intiial request and second request basically came back to back.Fifth, the pillows were not comfortable. The long pillows were too long and too soft to be used. The sleeping pillows were again too soft. I am used to TempurPedic pillows so I again may be baised but the pillows were too soft. I basically felt that I was putting my head on the mattress. I do think they need to get the type of pillows that Marriott uses which are much more comfortable.Overall, the hotel was amazing and I had a great stay. If I come back to NY, I would definitely stay here again.",Atlanta,"a2wice</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta</strong>",13,4.0

When we woke up several hours later we didn't want to leave the room and hung out for most of the day because it was so comfortable.

The hotel is fantastic. Great location, fabulous rooms and staff that are so warm, friendly and full of enthusiasm that I never want to stay anywhere else in New York.The location right in the heart of trendy lower east side is fantastic for bars, restaurants and shopping, it's close to a metro to get you further up or down town too - but why leave when the achingly trendy lower east side has everything you need.We stayed in the king studio high up with great views. The room compared to others in NY is well thought out and offers the hints of modernity with iPhone docking stations and environmentally friendly toiletries.Every morning you can grab free coffee and pastry to go and every evening you can hang out and drink the free wine and cheese while you plan your night.The David Burke Kitchen is a great restaurant - whether for room service or eating in and Jimmy's the roof top bar with pool has the most spectacular roof top views. Our Wedding Pictures are sensational!But the biggests pull of the hotel is the staff without a doubt. They treated us like royalty, upgrading us and bringing us chocolate and champagne on our wedding day. When I couldn't find a florist for my bouquet they stepped in to help. It was my partners birthday while we were away and they even decorated the room on my request. And my personal favourite after a day of organising weddings and feeling exhausted they even ordered us chinese takeout so we could have a quiet movie night in. They really show what great service is.Loved every minute of it and was extremely sad to leave, especially the big comfy bed!","London, United Kingdom","T0mWatts22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",6,5.0

SoHo/Tribeca seemed a good choice. The James in Chicago has a great reputation, so I figured the sister hotel would fit right in. The architecture of the building is new and industrially not welcoming. Orientation is definitely vertical, reinforced by having to take an open view elevator from the dismal street entrance up several stories to the lobby, sandwiched into an elongated rectangular footprint which is constricted by the main elevator shafts. My room space was also squeezed into a tiny space with high ceilings and full windows; unfortunately, they looked out, over some horrific open urban concrete plazas, upon the cars exiting and entering the Holland Tunnel entrance, with their associated honking and commotion. Good thing I was high up or the noise might have been an issue. I'm not sure I would rave about the neighborhood setting, but it made down or uptown walkable.I also experienced some of the bipolar service issues described in prior reviews. Everyone in the house is immensely friendly and cheerful. I did, however, run into several instances when a poor staff member was overwhelmed by the multi-tasking being demanded of him/her. Being asked simultaneously to retrieve stored bags for two guests, park a car outside the door, arrange for the courtesy car to drop another off, give directions to an entourage of filmmakers rolling tons of equipment across the floor (creating even less open space), and print duplicate room bills is a bit more than should be expected. Frantically requesting assistance from the ether through a bluetooth microphone emphasized the absurdity of that tough situation.Hopefully all will work itself out from the human element as the hotel enters its second year of operation.

We loved the neighborhood and all the great food and shopping you can easily access by foot. The lobby is very hip and lovely, the staff were all very friendly, the room was small, modern and quite nice. There were some interesting NYC books to read in the bed side table and I appreciated the fresh water set out every day. We did receive our turn down service all 3 nights with little chocolates The bathroom is roomy but doesn't really have a lot of place to put your ""stuff"" (and I know a lot of women have more stuff that I do!). The view of the Hudson was lovely, we loved it in all different kids of light. The bar was awersome at night and we had a great lunch at the restaurant.So, it sounds great and it was, but I stil have some small hesitiation about going back. Our room was an hour late past check in being ready, I can accept this, I guess but so many places seem to be able to get you in early that it was a big of a pain. The staff was very helpful storing luggage etc... so that it minimized the inconvenience. The bathroom could have been a little cleaner, there was clearly a couple of hair pins on the floor in the corner, that kind of bothered me, although it seemed quite clean in a general way.If I could get a good rate, I think I would give them another try because there are so many positives.

Arrived on the first evening at 21:30 after JFK traffic delays. Greeted at reception with 'would you like the good new or the bad news'. Went for bad news which resulted in 'oh, no-one asks for the bad news first' - you can imagine this game now becoming quire irritiating. So the bad news was 'we don't have a room for you but we have found you one at the Mondrian' (see separate review). Am less than impressed that having arrived, had all my luggage hauled to reception and tipped the dorrman, I am promptly being asked to leave. Ask to see the hotel manager and a chap arrives. His way of dealing with this is to say that this type of thing happens all the time and we are actually very lucky because they have bothered to find us a room elsewhere (which apparently is above and beyond normal practice and they didn't need to do so even though we had a confirmed and fully paid reservation). His manner was arrogant, unhelpful and simply rude. Funnily enough we didn't feel like being very grateful and as it was by now 22:15 we gave up and went to the Mondrian. Back the next day to drop off our luggage and were promised a room would be ready by our return at 17:00. It was and they had given us a corner room (upgrade) which was very nice (not huge but spacious enough). Didn't have a view of the Hudson though,which when we booked the website, it stated all rooms had views of the river (more of that later). The rooms are fine although the bathrooms (being all brown tiles) can be rather dark but full size bottles of toiletries great. Never quite sure that the room was throughly cleaned each day because there were oftens 'bits' on the floor - suspect the dark wood flooring shows up everything. Jimmys Bar is great for views but my Bloody Mary was the worst I have ever had. Hotel is in great SoHo location and after our 3 days we checked out. Naturally with what happended when we arrived, we spoke to reception who assured us they were very sorry for our inconvenience and when we returned again they would have a great room for us. Three nights later back we came (this time we arrived at about 20:30) and were given the key. Off we went and guess what the room was right opposite the lifts, not only that but on the bed was the outline of a person. Suspect that someone had been shown the room lay on the bed and then realised that you could hear the lifts and the noise of people standing chatting whilst they were waiting. We got on the phone and reception insisted there was nowhere to move us to. My husband went down and insisted he speak to someone else and eventually a nice chap came and 'miraculously' found us a room further down the corridor away from the lift. What is really annoying is when you book, you are asked to specify all sorts of requirements e.g. 'do you want to be away from the lift' and when you arrive (especially if you get there late) you just get given any old room. Next day we opended the curtains and had a view of a tower block - no Hudson. Having by now had our fill we asked again to speak to the hotel manager. This time we saw a very nice woman who actually was the manager (title was hotel director but basically she is in charge). She was great and apologised for all our issues and the staff (even for the guy who on our first night had incorrectly claimed to be the manager). She was also going to get the website updated to remove the incorrect messages about the views (they have now done so but it has taken some months). So we loved the location but found the staff (in most cases) to be inept, sometimes even rude and more interested in prancing about in their designer uniforms chatting to each other than looking after guests. I still can't decide if I would return - I only hope they have improved their customer service.",London,"Katkin1965</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",128,3.0

It was also SO noisy that we moved once ( the first day) to what they said was a quieter room, but it was very loud with noise from other rooms/door slamming, etc. Also, there was such a lack of attention to detail - only turn-down service one night of our 5 night stay, and no real knowledge from the concierge staff about the cool new restaurants in town.

But to be fair to the hotel, it did seek to rectify my grievance - which is a good sign and I thought I would share my thoughts. The James has some excellent plus points - the rooftop bar is stunning (and I have stayed at Mandarin Oriental which also has a spectacular bar and Library Hotel). What is cool about it is that you see Soho in all its glory - at night, the view is electric. I checked out quite a few roof top bars in NYC and the view from Jimmy's exceeds them all. What needs addressing is the synergy between the rooftop and the other aspects of the hotel, updating customers when appropriate and providing a consistent level of service. It is also a very small space which can get crowded.The location of the hotel is excellent. After considering Crosby Street and Trump Soho in quite a lot of detail, I was glad with my choice. While I am sure Crosby and Trump have far superior and more polished service, I liked that the James was halfway between Soho and the very cool area of Tribeca. The James has some really excellent staff members on reception and especially on the door - these guys are excellent and deserve credit. Unfortunately, staff communication needs to be improved and also informing guests properly, rather than just emailing them and expecting them to understand. Jimmy's also contains some surprisingly unfriendly staff that do the rest of the hotel an injustice. One of the bar men is a bit too cool for his own good and could do with coming down a peg or two (you are not a barman at the Top of the Standard, mate).The lobby area is a nice area for guests to hang out in - free coffee, tea and wine is served there. Some cool artworks are arranged throughout the hotel, from established and up and coming artists. I wish the service was a bit more even and polished, then as I say this would be one of the best hotels in New York. Although it is on the Conde Nast Gold List 2011, I believe it is resting on its laurels and needs to improve - fast.","London, United Kingdom","Londoner016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",262,3.0

I came her for my fortieth birthday, after a grueling, horrible flight where they lost my luggage.My boyfriend reimburses me money for my flight, expenses, taxi, etc. and we put it in the safe. We were laughing and got distracted and forgot to lock it. We went down to the hotel's restaurant for lunch and when I got back, the maid had made the bed, tidied up etc., the closet door where the safe was was closed (and we had left it open upon leaving). I remembered I hadn't locked it and ran to the safe. The envelope was gone.We are positive we put it in there and did our due diligence to verify this. This is the most horrible feeling you can have while traveling. I was then detained in the room waiting for the evidence collector and spending one precious vacation day miserable, violated. I had to stay and talk to the police, wait for the sergeant to dust off the safe and basically be treated like a prisoner after been burglarized by one of the staff.What a nightmare.

Everyone says some contrived, robotic statement like, ""We will do our best to rectify the situation.""

The only was regret was not carving out more time to spend in the hotel.We went to NY to celebrate a special occasion and were surprised to find the hotel staff has a special treat waiting for us in our room. This was a fantastic way to start our trip, especially after a late night flight from L.A. I also enjoyed the short ride on the glass elevator up to the lobby, where I’m told they have coffee and pastries in the morning, some kind of snack during the day, and wine in the evening. Every hotel employee we encountered was happy to help us whenever we had a question or request, especially the doormen. They helped us with car service to the airport, which is way better than a cab and surprisingly not too pricey—ask about it. There are also cool orange bikes in the lobby for use. We upgraded to a corner room, and it was totally worth the extra $$. Even though we didn’t have the curtains open all the time, the view was incredible when we did. Speaking of views, the rooftop bar is not to be missed, especially at sunset. We are in our early thirties, and found the crowd to be somewhat hipsterish, yes, but not annoying—if that combination is possible. There were certainly guests in the hotel who did not fit that description in the least and seemed to be getting along just fine. We went up there a couple times and it was actually pretty peaceful. Take your camera.As for the room, the bed was hands down the most comfortable I have slept in. Ever. My husband is a frequent world traveler and he agreed. We liked the big rainfall shower as well. A bathtub would have been nice, but space is at a premium, of course. Housekeeping did a great job and we were happy to return to our room every day. I also enjoyed the carafe of filtered water the hotel left for us near the bed. My only gripe is that one night our phone was not working and all we wanted to do was order room service, but we didn’t have the energy to complain, so I can’t fault the hotel as they didn’t even know the problem existed. As I had consumed a moderate amount of alcohol that night, I probably would have ordered something I would regret in the morning. So perhaps the universe was looking out for me. Neighborhood is great. In the heart of Soho, very close to the subway, and easy stroll to West Village to hang out, or head the other way to Little Italy when you have a craving for cannoli, which is right now. Speaking of food nearby, we had breakfast/brunch twice at a place around the corner on Broadway called Sanctuary T, which I highly recommend. There’s a place a few doors down from that called the Cupping House that has good Eggs Benedict. We popped in to Café Noir, right across the corner from the hotel for a late night snack and were not impressed. They actually forgot about us after 2 rounds of drinks and never took our order. David Burke Kitchen (in the hotel) seemed like a great place, but the menu was not really exciting for a vegetarian so we passed, much to my carnivore husband’s dismay.Thank you to The James.

For instance, the clock in my room stopped working -- it was blinking back and forth from a blank screen to scrambled color bars -- so I took to turning it face-down on the table (you couldn't unplug it) and putting a newspaper over it. And every day housekeeping would come by and turn it upright again, yet apparently never seemed to notice that it was broken despite that being glaringly obvious. Now, in fairness, I never remembered to call about it, so I'm sure the hotel would've sent someone up to fix it, but it is also sort of indicative of my experience with housekeeping here that they repeatedly put the clock back in place and never did anything about it being so clearly broken. They also didn't regularly empty wastebaskets, and the room smelled like smoke when I arrived. It took two calls down to the front desk to get a remote fixed. Stuff like that. They just were kind of spacey.However, the front-desk staff and the bellhops were super nice -- in fact, the housekeepers were nice too -- and the hotel is in a great location, right near both the red and blue lines on the subway and with tons of good eateries around, plus an all-night deli across the street that makes great sandwiches. The bed was comfortable, and if the pictures of the bathroom with the glass wall freak you out, it's okay: There is a motorized shade you can put down with the flip of a switch. The chair at the tiny table is ridiculously uncomfortable -- the pad they put it on it is not large enough, so the metal frame dug into my legs; classic example of choosing design over comfort -- but you can solve that by sitting on the leather banquette instead, which also has two drawers underneath it that were ideal for storing clothes. The closet size was fine, but there are never enough hangers in hotels, and this was no exception.We will totally stay here again, though.

It's located in SoHo near all the shops and restaurants and also near a train line if you need to be someplace else. Don't take the train? Well there's a free car service to get you where you need to go. The rooms are small but what room isn't in NYC? The bathrooms are super cool with the rainfall shower head and the really nice toiletries. There's also a movable shade if you're the shy type and don't want your roomie or significant other to see you in various states of undress through the all glass enclosure. The lobby and business center area are both well designed and decorated. You feel like you're in someone's swank loft lounging around using the computer or having a drink on the couch than in a hotel. I've stayed at the James a few times now and each time there was a celeb hanging out in the lobby.The gym at the top of the hotel is adequate to get a decent workout in. Lots of combo type machines where you pull levers to do for example a chest press then a shoulder press. There's a cable pulley as well with various attachments and a few treadmills. The great thing about the gym is that its on a high floor and you can see all of lower Manhattan through the windows. It's a great place for a workout.One advice...make sure you go to the rooftop bar and have two cocktails. My friends in NY tell me that everyone who lives in the city tries to find a way to bar since that's where the cool kids hangout.

An oddly shaped property means that the lobby is not on the ground floor and there's an assortment of elevators that lead to different levels of the building. The feeling succeeds in being more boutique-like than confusing though. Our request for an early check-in could not be accommodated due to check-outs but the staff tried. The room on the 10th floor (1003) looking south toward downtown was pretty and the shower was delightfully spacious. A/C worked great. Not a lot of space to put things down in the rooms... a small table and just a little counter space. The FREE WIRELESS throughout the hotel was great, fast, and appreciated. David Burke Kitchen is slightly pricey for what you get and the waffles were disappointingly heavy. The Kitchen was the least exciting part of the stay. The upstairs club and ""splash"" pool are nice but often crowded with hipsters and if they're playing any kind of live music the area is so small there's no where to escape it. We ordered massages and the ""spa"" was the least impressive part of the stay... the hotel hires out for their masseuses. The quality of the massage was good but the price is way too expensive. You would expect the full spa (showers/baths/steam) for what you pay but you only get a rather pedestrian pop-up tent called the Cabana. Noise from the outdoor dining patio just thirty feet away overpowers the music played for your massage. I would definitely recommend seeking spa facilities elsewhere where you will get more bang for your buck. Room service was good and timely, and everyone was friendly.

Down sides: we were charged $16 per connected call (even if the call just hit voicemail and you hung up) which meant when we checked our bill in more detail, we'd been charged around $100 for telephone calls that didn't happen. The rooftop bar in the hotel ""The Jimmy"" is a little too cool for school and the woman serving behind the was pretty aggressive (or maybe pretty and aggressive!) but I guess that just goes with the territory.

Overall I really loved the hotel but there were a couple of little things that weren't ideal. I'll start with the good stuff though!While my corner queen room was not huge, the windows were massive and let in an extraordinary amount of light. The opening windows were a great touch too for letting in some of the New York sights and sounds. The hotel has free wifi (which you have to log in to every time you use, but that's not too annoying), guest computers in the lobby lounge, and some really great spaces to sit and relax, including the croquet lawn!! Coffee and snacks are served in the lobby during the day, with wine and cheese served from 6pm - 8pm each evening. A really great touch! I'd usually stop off in the lobby on my way back to my room after a huge day for a reviving glass of Chardonnay. Unfortunately for me there was a family with three young children staying at the same time, and while the parents had a wine the children climbed all over the furniture and generally made a bit of a nuisance of themselves. I had to escape a couple of times as it was not at all relaxing.The rooftop bar, Jimmys, was a fabulous spot with sweeping views across the city, great bar staff, delicious cocktails and the best tuna tatar tacos I've ever eaten! The pool is open for hotel guests until 5pm - I thought this was a bit early to close on a couple of the really warm evenings, but the bar filled up pretty quickly from then on and they really wanted the swimsuit crowd gone so the party crowd could take over! It was also closed for private functions twice during my stay which was a pity.I only had breakfast at David Burke Kitchen (excluding the food I ate in the bar and around the pool which was excellent) and it wasn't that great for the price. There were better cafes within minutes for breakfast. Also all drinks in both bars were served in plastic glassware. Something I saw was quite common in NY. I think the quality of the plastic glassware was pretty poor though, such a disappointment to drink a great glass of champagne or wine in a thick rimmed plastic goblet.Probably my last irk was that there was no in-room compendium. I understand it was supposed to make the hotel super chic to just phone the lobby any time you needed a question answered, but sometimes you just was to look up what time the bars/restaurants open or close, what time check-out is, or the name of a local beauty salon/hairdresser etc. I love flicking through a good hotel compendium! Some of this info was available on the website. They did, however, provide a room service menu. My room did not have a lot of space - the wardrobe was small, there was nowhere to put my makeup or sponge bag in the bathroom and the huge mini-bar tray took up the only other surface space in the room (I eventually moved it to a cupboard above the wardrobe). But these are little things that aren't really deal breakers. The hotel space is lovely, plenty of art on the walls, a busy bar and restaurant scene, gorgeous green spaces for relaxing, and fabulous roof top pool with great views. The staff were all very helpful and genuinely keen to make sure we enjoyed our stay. I would definitely stay here again.","Melbourne, Australia","TorOnTour</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",15,4.0

We had the same check in experience that most others had where the room type we booked was not ready, but did we want another one on a lower floor or we could wait. A glass of wine was offered to us to enjoy in the lobby lounge. We finished that and headed up to the rooftop bar to have a snack. The rooftop area was gorgeous - lovely views of the city. Some of the expensive chairs were broken as was the pool - it was closed for repairs our entire stay. Too bad as that was one of the amenities that drew us to the property. Food and service from the bar were good - didn't like drinking $12/glass wine in a plastic wine glass, but that's a safety thing.The staff came to get us when the room was ready (very nice of them) and were brought to the room on the 17th floor just under Jimmy the rooftop club.

It has a glass wall that connects to the room with a shade that can be lowered if desired. It seems the floors have a heated option, but may be shut off in the warm months.Our package included daily in-room breakfast - no matter what we chose on the menu for pastries, we were always brought a variety of things.

The pool is actually a rooftop bar so when you like to dip the pool after a days work it is not possible, it closes at 5 PM.

The pool on the roof wasn't yet open but it looked a very promising facility with a comfortable seating area and great views. Unfortunately the rooftop bar appears to have been contracted out to be run as a bar/night club so was only open in the evening when it attracted a lively and youngish crowd from outside (it had its own separate entrance and elevator from the street level). This meant that we couldn´t go up for a drink, for instance, at midday. We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel because we walked to our daughter and son-in-law who live nearby.

Room very nice though I would have liked a bath. Our 2 teenagers had an upgraded room so a big bed to share, rather than the normal queen size which we had. I like the coffee and yummy pastry in the lobby in the morning, and the cheese and wine in the later afternoon (though you do have to serve yourself and the coffee comes in paper cups). 10 out of 10 for people watching opportunities and our 19 year old's eyeballs were out on stalks! Does it live up to the hype as a place for your average tourist to stay? Nope, unless that is, you fancy yourself as a extra from Sex and the City or you meet the demographic for the rooftop bar. In which case, you will absolutely love it!!The reason we were disappointed...the thorny (and no doubt for the manager-oft repeated) issue of ""The Pool"" and Jimmy's bar. If you come in midwinter, this will not be a problem as a pool is not important. We came in late July early August and chose the hotel because we thought we might want chill out by the pool from time to time.Anyone booking this hotel should realise that the premises should be described as follows: ""Happening bar with plunge pool (BTW-114 room hotel attached if you need to stay over)"". In all my experience I have never come across a hotel with a pool that is less available to guests at the times they want to use it than non residents. The local (and pool free) glitterati must be sooo delighted. After 4 nights here during what has probably been the hottest part of the summer let me just describe my experience:Sunday 31st July. Back in from a hard day seeing the sights, temperature is mid 30's degrees C, high 90's fahrenheit. Think we have time for a quick dip to cool off at about 4.30. (pool scheduled to close at 5pm-how daft is that??) Cossie on, jump in the lift to the roof. Lift door opens...place utterly rammed, thumping music (DJ), pool surrounded by 20 and 30 somethings packed in like sardines. Picture a Playboy pool party (minus Hugh Heffner). The very friendly chap in charge could see the look of horror on our faces and said that guests could, in theory, turf non residents off the chairs and sunbeds or ask those sitting round the pool (feet dangling in the water) to move so that we could wedge our (well preserved but sadly middle aged) bodies in and sit ""cheek to cheek"" with other revellers. We politely declined. He told us that tomorrow it might not be quite so bad (no DJ booked), but that the pool may close later in the week for the odd private party. So far to my knowledge there was some sort of do for Broadway shows, and this evening an Italian TV company had the use of the place from 5-8.30. Soo...so far that's every night where something else is going on.....2nd August. I did venture up at 4pm...hurrah! Sunbed available. Lay on it. G&T ""only"" $16 without tip. Told at 4.30pm that the place was closing at 5. American PR for Italian TV do arrives...followed by cameraman doing initial set up shots. All highly amusing to watch, but still, why, having paid over $2500 for 2 rooms (or should I now say $2516) we, the paying punters, take second place to the non residents and the hotel's self regarding PR machinations. Being the latest big thing is self evidently short lived and ephemeral; thereafter the hotel will have to live off the reputation earned from providing the guests with a satisfying stay.

Situated in Soho amongst bars and boutique shops with a bit more character than you find on 5th, but handy for subway (2 minute walk to the nearest line and then 15 minutes to 5th). Seemed a very new hotel; clean, well decorated and aircon to die for. Good quality bedding and decent double-glazing - if you've not stayed in NY be prepared for traffic horns and sirens. Floor to ceiling windows throughout including a glass wall separating the bathroom from the bedroom; remember to drop the blind if you want to avoid putting on a 'show' for the office workers in the blocks opposite.Liked the open-air bar on ground floor although a little pricey. Same goes for bar on roof but worth it considering the views. You're not going to be doing laps in the small pool but its great for cooling off. A few loungers and chairs, although space is a little on tight side - fine when I visitedthe roof during the week but packed on Saturday. Until 9 the bar's for guests but after 9 its open to the public (the pretty crowd) and numbers are restricted; being a guest doesn't mean you get priority.On the whole the staff were superb but we did have a bit of a run-in with one waiter with a bit of an attitude problem but that wasn't going to spoil our stay.I definitely recommend this for both business and pleasure; smart and stylish but not too up itself.","London, United Kingdom","Mrv68ec</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",64,5.0

Several months prior to the trip, I booked the stay through Luxurylink.com, which offered a good rate for a king bed room and breakfast in bed. To our huge disappointement--we got neither. We had traveled extensively in the past and often relied on luxurylink to book our accomodations and never encountered an issues no matter where in the world our travels took us.After a red eye flight from the west coast and numerous prior calls to The James (all indicating that we would be acommodated earlier in the morning), we walked into the hotel exhausted and, as we soon found out, out of luck. Apparently, the hotel had just booked up and we were not going to get the room until, well, ""Indefinitely"". In fact, nothing became available until after 1 pm, by which point we already got a quick nap in my sister's room who was kind enough to evacuate so that we could get a few hours of sleep (my sister and husband arrived a day earlier). This was a very unpleasant welcome, but considering how hotels operate in general--not overly disappointing and barring additional problems--could prove to be a decent stay. However, what unfolded next was a complete screw up of our reservation and a major blow to our experience with the hotel.After spending a very busy day in the city, we returned to our room (which we barely even saw during the day) only to find that we were given a lower category room with a queen, instead of king, size bed. To some this may not have been much of a problem, but this was extremely important and one of the main selling points of this hotel's package on luxurylink. It was quite late in the evening and I proceeded to call the reception desk only to be told that we were placed in the correct category and should only have a queen size bed. This got me fuming as I knew what I booked and had the reservation confirmation right in front of me. The staff made us go downstairs to ""show proof"" of our reservation and my husband reluctantly did so. In conclusion, the hotel did nothing about the wrong room as, according to them, they were all booked up anyway. After insisting for the next 30 minutes that we deserved more than just a king size room the next night, we were still left with nothing--in our tiny room and tiny bed. I will admit that they did put us up in a higher category room the next day; however, since it was only available late in the afternoon and we had a busy day, we could not enjoy it until quite late in the evening. The room; however, was nice, but did not make up for the unpleasant welcome or all the frustration of the night before. After returning home, I took another look at our booking and noticed that we never received or were even asked about the breakfasts in bed which we were supposed to get on the two mornings we were there. Apparently, that--just like the kind size bed--was magically disappeared from the reservation. This realization, along with the fact that The James has been completely unresponsive to our issues surrounding our stay, is why I would never want to return or recommend this hotel to others. Had it not been for these gross errors and neglect in customer service, I would consider this a good place to stay. The hotel does have a nice location if you want to walk around SoHo and some interesting quirks like the roof pool, very modern design, etc.","San Francisco, California","julias_sf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",7,2.0

The hotel itself is very well designed, the rooms are comfortable, and the staff is amazing. So, so nice. Like, you're not even in NYC nice. And I actually live in NYC so I don't automatically assume everyone in NYC is rude. Chris, who greets you when you first enter, is the nicest person I have ever met in the service industry. The only drawback to this place was that their systems didn't seem quite in order. For instance, when I arrived in my room, the folder containing the hotel info, including the room service menu (which is what I was looking for), was empty. I called the front desk, who very nicely explained the info was in the folder. When I told them it was empty, they apologized and sent up a new folio. Well, the first guy who came brought me a menu for the restaurant, which was not the same as room service, but the second guy got it right. Communication seemed to be a little off.Another small thing: The breakfast menu that you hang on the door was waiting for me on the bed, except it was already filled out, and by another room! Such a small thing - I just ordered a new one - but so, so strange to me how this could have happened. Someone obviously not paying a lot of attention. When breakfast came the next morning, they had forgotten milk for my coffee. I'm not the kind of person who gets upset about stuff like that, but I note it. I just called and asked for milk - they were super nice and apologetic. I also asked for water, but was only brought milk. No big deal, but again, it seems like such a small thing could be prevented by a little more attention to detail, actually checking the tray before it leaves the kitchen. I didn't get to check out the roofbar because they were having a private party - both times. Kind of a disappointment.I really hope they get these details straightened out, because then it would be a perfect hotel. The second time I stayed with my dog, and they were so sweet to her. She got a little gift bag with doggy treats. (Although, somewhat in keeping with the other small overlooked details, there was a dog bed in the room but no dog bowl, so she drank out of a glass. I didn't feel like calling the desk yet again for something).I also used the valet parking which was very easy and convenient. The food at the restaurant and the room service food was just ok. The service at the restaurant was a little lackluster - the waiters spent as much time talking to each other as they did waiting on the tables, and I had to stand up and wave a few times to get things. But they were nice enough. Just not very attentive. I sat in the outdoor garden area on my first visit.One more thing: I hope the management will allow dogs into the outdoor garden area of the restaurants, because it was hard for me to find a place to eat with dog in tow.","New York City, New York","jessls87</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",22,4.0

Dan, from the front desk, was awesome! He arranged dinner reservations, shared his knowledge of theatre options, and always called me by name. The continental breakfast is limited, but nice and convenient. The wine and cheese service in the early evenings is also a nice amenity for the hotel.

We arrived at the door on a rainy evening at about 10pm, and there was absolutely NO ONE on line. However, the doorman not only refused us entry, but was inappropriate, condescending and rude to us. I am an adult and a mother who simply wanted to see the bar/view and have a post-dinner drink, and I was treated like garbage by this person. When I reported our experience to the hotel staff in the lobby, the staff and manager were apologetic, understanding and accommodating.

Upon our arrival at 2pm (hotel's check in time) we were told that our room wasn't cleaned yet so they would call our cell and let us know when it was done. We were assured it wouldn't be too long. So we took a walk in to Soho and went shopping.

I was really looking forward to it as I´m a big fan of their excellent hotel in Chicago.As the hotel was very new none of the taxi drivers knew where it was. So keep the address  handy so they can type it in to their Sat Navs. We were lucky to find the hotel as there was no name above the entrance and there were no doormen. (A name was put up while I was there)  There are actually 2 reception areas, one at the entrance, and the main one on the first floor.  (Where you check in)At check we were offered a corner room. If you can, these are the rooms to get as the views are stunning.The restaurant was not open which was a disappointment as the restaurant at the James in Chicago is first class. Also there was no bar or any alcohol available to purchase (no license) this was bizarre for a luxury hotel.  The nearest the staff could offer was a deli on the corner which delivered, but you had to eat in your hotel room as there was no dining area. Eating a $8 wrap in your room is something you´d do in a $20 a night backpackers hostel. Not in a $250+ a night boutique hotel.For breakfast there was complimentary coffee and pastries and in the afternoon cheese and (rather average) wine.There was no concierge, which again in a luxury hotel is something you would expect. Though the staff had a list of nearby restaurant this isn´t the same as having a dedicated concierge who has expert knowledge of bars and restaurants etc.I asked one of the staff to make a brunch reservation in one of the hottest restaurants in town. I was horrified when I got to the restaurant and they had no record of the reservation.  This could have been the fault of the restaurant and not of the hotel staff. In the end it wasn´t a problem as I got a table after only a 5 min wait.I wanted to know how much a shuttle was to JFK so I asked the front desk staff in the morning, they did not know, I was a surprised by this as I thought it a fairly standard question. However, they promised to look into it and have an answer later in the day. When I returned later in the day the staff had changed and had not left any details with their colleagues so it was a case of back to square one. This was very frustrating.I discovered by chance there was an excellent roof top gym when I saw a fellow guest in gym clothes. I was not told about the gym at check in nor were there any signs. Again, I thought this to be a real oversight.One night it was raining and the hotel had run out off complimentary umbrellas. I found this unbelievable especially considering the hotel could not have been more than 20% full. Rain is not uncommon in New York, and I was stunned that they only had about 4 or 5 for a hotel that has so many rooms.  Surely they could have gone to a local store and bought a few.The overall standard of the room was excellent. The staff were young (all under 30) and naturally had only been there for a matter of weeks but were very friendly and attentive.The lifts at times were painfully slow to arrive. There are only 2, which in a hotel with around 20 floors doesn´t seem to be enough. I would hate to see it when the hotel is 100% full.As it was mid Oct the rooftop bar wasn´t open yet. This was a shame as on their web the views looked fantastic.Overall I had a positive experience. It is is a great hotel and centrally located. I did come away with the feeling that it was very much a work in progress, the hotel wasn´t finished,  there were tradesmen working the whole time I was there (though they didn´t cause too much noise or inconvenience) ",madrid,"Travelinggorgorito</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>madrid</strong>",15,4.0

The rooms were well equipped, not necessarily spacious but fine for New York. The bed was very comfortable, and the chocolate for both of us in the evening was a nice touch. We stayed on the fifth floor and were initially a little worried that we might hear some street noise - we needn't have worried as we didn't hear much at all from outside.There are quite a few bars and restaurants downstairs, and a convenience store just across the road. There's also a subway stop literally around the corner, and a stop on another line about ten minutes walk away.Like some other reviewers, we noticed that wine and cheese is served around 5 in the evening, but unfortunately only on our last evening. Unlike some other hotels I researched, the wifi is completely free and works well. The only slight downside is that you need to revalidate the wifi every 12 hours, although it's not a big deal.Perhaps the only fault we could find was the size of the gym. Whilst we realise space is at a premium in New York, when we went to use the gym all five or so machines were in use. Probably if we went at a less busy time of the day (we tried to use the gym at around 8 am) we would have been ok, but more fitness machines (including upright bikes, for which there were none) might help.FInally, the hotel had a business centre of sorts in the lobby, which had a printer we could use for free - great for printing boarding passes. Overall though, very hard to fault and we had a great time in New York and at the James. We wouldn't hesitate to visit again.","Singapore, Singapore","elbeasto1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",2,4.0

Our go-to hotel in NYC is the Gansevoort, but thought we'd try the new James that we read was opening. We booked before the hotel even opened, slightly nervous that there would be kinks and growing pains when we arrived. We were pleasantly surprised that the stay was fairly seamless. Here's our take:PROS: - We were impressed before we arrived. I received a call from the concierge a few days before our arrival asking if we had any special requests. We've stayed at various Four Seasons and Amans in more service-oriented locales than NYC and have never gotten such a call. We were equally pleased after we arrived. - Great location. - Hotel was modern and chic, minimalist decor, cool artwork. - The front desk staff was enthusiastic, friendly, and customer service oriented. We arrived on an early morning flight and our room was not ready. They told us they would prepare one right away. We went for breakfast and, by the time we got back an hour later, we were able to check in. Great first impression. - The room was nice. Smallish, but not bad for NYC. Cute modern decor; desk area where I was able to comfortably do some work. Bathroom was nice, has a cool glass wall so you can see into the room and out the window, but you can choose to close the shade. - Free wifi, which is always a plus! (It's such a racket when hotels charge you for wifi, given how much you pay for the room.) - Every evening, the hotel offered complimentary wine and cheese in the lobby at around 5 pm, which was a really nice touch. One evening, we enjoyed a glass of wine while surfing the net in their business center looking for a bar we wanted to check out. We stopped by on a second evening (we stayed for 5 nights), but the set up wasn't ready (maybe evidence of some growing pains here). - Door guys were cheery and enthusiastically greeted us every time we walked in. Each night, they asked if we wanted to be escorted up to the rooftop bar to avoid any lines. Very nice.CONS: - The reservations department is awful. You can't ever get through on the phone. The hold recording tells you that if you input your number, someone will call you back when it's your turn in the queue. I did that a couple of time, but no one ever called me back. It seems like they outsource it and that the calls don't go directly to the hotel. - The walls of the rooms are very thin. I tried to take a nap one day and could hear the man next door on a business call that lasted nearly an hour. - Also, one evening we tried to go up to the rooftop bar, but were told it was closed for a private event, which was disappointing. - Otherwise, we had no real complaints about the hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed it and would have given the hotel 5 stars, particularly on service, in this review, if not for the follow up service (or lack thereof) we received. Because we were one of the early guests staying at the James during the first months after its opening in the fall of 2010, we were offered a free night if we came back within a certain timeframe at the beginning of 2011. We decided to go back to NYC, so I called the hotel attempting to book a reservation and redeem the offer for the one-night stay. Well, turns out that's not such an easy thing to do. I called on separate occasions and have not been able to get anyone to help me. I was told that the person I needed to speak with is someone in the general manager's office. Despite calling twice and leaving her a message, I've gotten no response from her or anyone. Apparently, the James was not interested in honoring what seemed to be a very cool and generous offer it made to its guests. It's really a shame because our experience was fairly positive and we would have been return guests (in fact, as mentioned, I tried to book another reservation!). Unfortunately, this subsequent experience really soured our opinion of the hotel.

So we had recently stayed again and it was just as great as before.. the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful.

The lift to the reception wasn't working, the restaurant wasn't working, and most of the other services were not working as well. To make matters worse, one of my shirts was stolen (or misplaced) by housekeeping and my dry cleaning went missing for a day and did not show up until minutes before I left for the airport. As a consolation, the manager sent me a letter giving me a free night at the hotel which was a nice gesture, but he put an unrealistic deadline to take the offer. I live outside of the country and travel to New York frequently, but could not make it in time for the deadline.I am planning to travel again to New York and decided to give The James another chance since the first experience may have been due to a new inexperienced staff. I called reservations and asked to speak to the person noted in the letter (as instructed in the letter). I was told that he no longer worked there and that I should speak to Jennifer. Jennifer did not answer the telephone, so I found out her email address and emailed her the request and explained that I could not make it before March 31 but was wondering if they could make an exception due to the horrific experience the first time and since I was planning on spending another 4 nights at the hotel (not just taking advantage of one free night). No answer. So I decided to call again to The James and was put in contact with the office manager. I reminded her that I sent her an email and she acknowledged that she received it but for whatever reason did not respond to it (a bad sign already that things have not changed at The James). She then told me that they cannot make exceptions because if they made an exception for me, then they would have to make exceptions for all of their other customers (what is this...the Soviet Union?). After some prodding, she then said that she might be able to give me a discount on the room. However, the discount she gave me was still comparable to the prices at the Trump Soho which just opened and is a 5 star hotel! When I pointed this out to her and explained that if they would honor their letter, they would still end up ahead because I would be staying another 4 nights, she still dug in her heels and wouldn't budge. I know things are tight for hotels, but given the first bad impression I had for the hotel, this really took the cake! It's a pity because they hotel could be one of the most trendy hotels in the area, but I'm afraid that their attitude (or lack of customer service) is going to make guests flee to other hotels. It's just not worth the price...you have to climb stairs and take a lift to the cramped lobby and the rooms are even smaller. The only way for this hotel to make it in a competitive city like New York is to have outstanding, friendly service. In spite of the horrible first experience at the hotel, I was willing to give it a second chance. But why put up with unfriendly and a non-flexible attitude? Maybe the office manager was following orders, but sometimes common sense should prevail. As a result, they lost my business now and in the future and I happily made a reservation down the street at the Trump Soho. It looks like a much nicer hotel and the prices are about the same, so I will give it a try.","London, United Kingdom","balticdude4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",23,3.0

Clearly not worth the price we paid for the room, but the General Manager at the time, gave us a letter for a complimentary stay any day through March. When I called to book a room on Monday, I was passed from person to person and finally told that they would check and get me a confirmation about my selected date later that day. Four days went by with no response, so I called back and was finally told that there was no availability on the date in question. Plenty of rooms available at rack rates, just none available for their comp letter. Of course it was subject to availability, but that meant, I was told, not availability of the hotel, but availability of rooms suitable for fulfilling their comp letter obligations. This struck me as total BS. I was then told that the general manager and at least one other position has turned over / they've been fired in the last few days. The revenue manager (who makes these decisions) could only be reached by email because she only owns a cell phone and didn't have a hotel number.

I chose the ""average"" rating for this hotel as it has many positive attributes relative to the average hotel; however, I would rate it ""poor"" relative to hotels in this price range...The hotel has a number of pros, including the location (right between Soho and Tribeca), the quality/design features of the rooms, the consistently friendly and cheerful nature of the staff members, the high-quality roof-top bar, the nice gym, the free wireless, and the free food and drinks available in the lobby.However, the cons were much more problematic than I would expect for a hotel in this price range. First, they lost all of my husband's belongings for a short period (in brief, he was told to leave his belongings in his room before leaving for work, then I would arrive later in the day, collect his things, and move to an upgraded room; when I arrived, his belongings had been removed from his original room, unbeknownst to the guest services staff, and they were unable to locate them for perhaps half an hour (who knows where they were??)). Second, on my first day at the hotel, I left our room at 10am, put on the ""housekeeping please"" sign, and returned at 2pm only to find the room uncleaned. I called guest services and asked them to arrange for the cleaning. I complained again at 4pm (after hanging out in the lobby for longer than I would have liked), and the room cleaning wasn't completed until 5pm. Third, after 9pm hotel guests can't access the roof-top bar from inside the hotel but instead have to walk around outside and enter with everyone else. Fourth, my husband had some sort of allergic reaction (rash) to their ""hypoallergenic"" lotion. And finally, there were several instances when my key card didn't work on our room door, and I had to go back down to the lobby to get it reset. In sum, there were some really nice features to this hotel, but for a hotel of this caliber (and price), there were too many problems to deal with. This is a relatively new hotel, and there are clearly more kinks that need to be worked out. I wouldn't stay there again, as the irritations associated with our stay in many ways outweighed the benefits.","Arlington, Virginia","Katia S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",0,3.0

Parking was easy (no meters), and cabs were easy to come by for trips after we parked the car. Every single staff member was helpful and friendly. And, everyone was over the top happy with our little terrier. Each and every staff member seemed naturally pleasant. Nothing put on. True winning personalities with the door men, reception and check-in staff, and the bar crew (especially Nathalie - the manager) were what we wanted. Genuine, cool, easy-going, yet interested in providing top-notch service. I felt that every dollar was well-spent here.The bar is a place that I wouldn't leave if I didn't have to do so. The drinks were inventive, and tasty. I do not know of too many spots that have Nicaraguan rum. The views from the bar are better than going to the top of the Empire State Building. Get out of the line, get up the elevator to this sky top bar, and have a drink while you soak in the views of river to river, as well as Empire Bldg lit up and the quickly rising Freedom Tower.The room - cool products that you will enjoy using, glass bathroom with privacy shade, heated floors, rain shower, eco-friendly aspects, bottle of water waiting (great after a day of shopping in SOHO!), robes, slippers, natural fabric linens on the bed, reading lamps that don't keep your mate awake, ample closet space, and ample living space in the king studio.The David Burke Restaurant is set to open Feb. 1st of 2011 (as they told me), and I would like to try that out!Although it isn't in the middle of the stores in SOHO, I think that it is nice to have the space and the views that this building affords. There are even ""zen"" gardens - SPACE! Hard to get in a NYC hotel.This apparently opened in October of 2010, and I didn't see service of construction flaws - this is a good sign for such a brand new place!I look forward to seeing the great people in this hotel, and experiencing the warm welcome again.","Tarrytown, NY","francophileinny</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tarrytown, NY</strong>",23,5.0

Due to flight problems we ended up staying a total of two weeks. While not without some glitches here and there, overall I would highly recommend this hotel and am definitely looking forward to staying here again.I'll start off with the minor issues. We had booked on their website and highlighted some room preferences which were not originally honored. Given that the hotel was not full, we were a bit surprised, but after asking, they upgraded our room. Now, the king room we were in seemed identical to our deluxe king upgrade, but apparently the difference is the higher floor/view. As for the rooms, we found them to be not particularly big but perfectly adequate and I'm a big fan of the organic amenities. I only wish we had individual amenities that we could take with us, but I figure they did it that way for environmental reasons. The walls seemed to be a bit on the thin side, as we were awoken by our neighbors arguing one night and could even hear when they coughed. We had to move rooms several times. Once was because there was no hot water (which the hotel should have realized before moving us since they had planned work being done in the area),but they ended up upgrading us for the inconvenience. Also in one of the moves they lost our travel locks, but very kindly reimbursed us to purchase new ones. I had noticed that some of the new rooms we moved into were not fully stocked at the bar, and thus they incorrectly charged us for using the items (two times). However, they had no issue taking off the charges. There was a bit of an issue checking out, as the person did not initially offer me an itemized bill, and when I requested a 2 part bill, he had trouble figuring that out. Long story short, while there were issues, they were handled in a satisfactory matter. The staff was wonderful-friendly, responsive, professional and unpretentious. Even the pedicab biker was super friendly! The lobby is beautiful and the free snacks and magazines/papers were a lovely touch. The coffee could definitely be better, but the rest of the snacks were very good. The rooftop bar is very cozy and we had a great bartender who talked to us all night and made some great drinks. The location is fantastic as it's close to tons of shopping and restaurants. Once they have the restaurant up and running it'll be close to perfect (I think a spa would make it perfect!). For the price, I think you get great value. Most luxury boutique hotels will charge more, so I hope they don't raise prices. I'm looking forward to revisiting the hotel!","Madison, New Jersey","chineseprincess</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madison, New Jersey</strong>",10,4.0

The hotel was spotless. It is only a few months old and it looks like it was just opened. We were greeted early in the morning with fantastic fresh coffee and pastries - no charge - and in the evening with wine and cheese. The staff at the front desk couldn't do enough to help us have a great stay. We were with friends celebrating a 40th birthday and they really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Our rooms were extremely comfortable and fairly spacious by NY standards. We have stayed at plenty of boutique hotels in New York and you always expect a room barely big enough to fit a bed. Our room felt roomy with a very comfortable bed. They were still waiting to open their restaurant but there are plenty of nearby options so it wasn't a problem for us.The only reason that I would keep from rating it 5 star is because of frustration around the rooftop bar. We weren't honestly that interested in the bar other than the fact that everyone at the hotel kept saying that we needed to check it out. We were only there for a Fri and Sat night so we didn't have many chances to see it. Friday night we came back early (around midnight) to have a drink there only to find out that there was a private event at the bar. The next day we attempted to get up there once again. Everyone assured us that the bar was open - no private event - so we should grab a drink Sat night. We were directed to the proper elevator (near the hotel elevators) only to be stopped by the person shuttling people up and down to the bar. Instead of welcoming us into the elevator, he directed us outside the hotel to the line along the side of the building. I guess that we should have expected this, but assumed that, as hotel guests, we had some preferential treatment. There was never mention of crowds and lines. We thought that we would have access to the bar associated with our hotel. When we didn't we were frustrated and found the manager who we expected would have a sympathetic ear. He didn't. He was actually the only person at the hotel that wasn't the least bit sympathetic. We finally learned that the hotel had no real connection with the bar which explained a lot. Separate management. If we would have known that from the beginning we would have had our expectations set properly and not returned for a late-night drink.Again, besides this confusion the stay was great. Other than the manager (who really had to do nothing more than act like he understood our disappointment) the staff was brilliant. We love the location and the hotel couldn't have been more pleasant.","San Francisco, California","carbon5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",18,4.0

I chose The James due to its mostly positive reviews, location, price, design, and amenities. I soon found out that some of the amenities that they claimed to provide were unavailable, leaving us a bit disappointed and frustrated with our stay. There are many positive aspects of this hotel. The location is great-so close to the shopping in Soho, as well as many other neighborhoods within walking distance. The hotel is also near two subway lines. They staff at the hotel were friendly and tried to be helpful. The rooms are interesting-they have a residential feel that comes off as quite cold, however, the room grew on me due to its simplicity. The bed was comfortable and we had a nice view of the west side of the city and New Jersey, but not the Hudson itself. This was the claim the website made and this was why I paid extra money for the room. This was the first thing I was a bit annoyed about. We were moved to a higher floor, but this did not matter, as I do not not think that any rooms at the hotel actually have a view of the Hudson. The room was a bit noisy as well-we could hear the elevator going up and down all night. Before we headed out for dinner, I called the front desk to ask for a DVD player, as my husband and I brought DVD's with us so we could spend a relaxing evening in the room. I had called the hotel earlier in the week to ask if a DVD player would be available, to which they said it would be. That evening, I spoke to someone who said they were bringing up the DVD player, but thirty minutes later received a call stating that the hotel did not have any. We were quite upset and on our way out for dinner, we spoke to the manager. After explaining our situation and expressing our disappointment, the manager finally asked what he could do. We asked him what he could do to appease the situation, and while he initially seemed unsure about what to do, he then offered to give us the night for free. We were a bit surprised by this offer and appreciated his generosity. So, I'm not really sure how to sum up my experience at The James. Some of it was good, but some of it was not so good. I think the potential is there, but there are some flaws that they need to sort out in order to provide the amenities and experience that guests are expecting during their stay.","brooklyn, ny","relliebelle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>brooklyn, ny</strong>",22,3.0

Yes, yes - we all see the chic sophisticated New Yorkers strolling around Tribeca and Soho with their dog bags or little Foo Foo on a spangly lead. Look good don't they? What about when they're in the room next door, at midnight scratching around or barking at 07.30 in their enthusiasm for the morning walk. This is before you think about the little Foo Foo that was in your room the night before leaving little Foo Foo sized packages. Grim. As a European this was a show stopper for me. Cue room move #1 - goodnight, Foo Foo.There were some other issues too - The air con was powered by what sounded like broken rocks rattling around in there. The two modes, hurricane or armageddon meant that getting to sleep (if you could get past little Foo Foo next door) was close to impossible without turning it off. New York in November might sound chilly - not a bit of it. Cue room move #2.Whilst I've got the whip out I'll carry on - The hotel's credit card clearing operation had issues authorising our credit card beyond a certain limit. You see they seem to use a factoring house which takes the risk above a certain level (I'm guessing $2000). So when you turn up to get card authorisation for say $2500 then the hotel is guaranteed to get the $2000 and the factoring house take the risk (for a fee, of course). Where this falls over is when you turn up at 11pm, bleary eyed after the flight and try to check in. The card authorisation fails, so you try another card. This also fails. You try a card from another bank, that fails too. You use your own mobile to call back to the UK bank who confirm they allowed it to go through without an issues. 30 mins has now passed and you're still stood at the front desk. Any offer to authorise 1 night and sort it in the morning? No. Sit down in the foyer and we'll come over when we've got the authorisation house? No. Tired and now a bit grumpy we eventually got it resolved and wandered to bed. We took a corner suite which whilst nicely designed was pretty small. Ok, it's New York I can live with that. Because the hotel is so new the room was pretty much covered in dust but why lots of hairs too? Hmm.There's no place to eat breakfast - You have this in your room, which is pretty small with a single low level coffee table. Not ideal - but the breakfast was well presented and hot. I understand the restaurant will be open Q1 next year - that's a good thing.4 coat hangers in the wardrobe? What's that all about? Asked for more twice before they arrived. Oh, asked for non feather pillows on the booking too, that wasn't done.Phew - got all the bad bits out of the way. There ARE good facets to this hotel. The location is outstanding. Right between Tribeca and Soho, it's great. The staff are accommodating and friendly and keen to help - Still feel they're all finding their feet slightly as the place is so new, but in the face of my grumpy protests about Foo Foo late at night, they were pleasant.The bar on the top floor is fantastic. In summer it will be *the* cool place to be. There's an open air pool there too which isn't widely advertised.For the morning after there's a gym. Small, but good facilities and a great view over the city.So there you have it - Would I recommend it, hesitantly yes. But I'd advise going mid - late 2011 when all the rough edges have been sorted, the restaurant is open and with the caveat that they've changed the air con. On the other hand, if you don't care about sleep and you want to be New York cool - it's the right place.",London,"Smifffy22b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",15,3.0

The James Hotel in SoHo opened in September of 2010, and though they had only been open for two months, the hotel staff was very knowledgeable and helpful. I have been in new hotels and restaurants before that it takes months and months to get things flowing, but The James does not have that problem. The hotel is beautiful, each hallway decorated with the artwork of local artists, the staff in uniforms designed by Buckler who has a shop in SoHo, the minibar stocked with all natural and organic snacks, organic body products in the bathroom, and every evening during turn down service they leave the most delicious chocolates on the nightstand that were locally made, as well... I reserved the Deluxe King Guestroom which landed me on the 3rd Floor, knowing that there was a chance that I would be staring straight into apartments across the street, or looking directly at a brick wall. However, I actually had a view! I did end up closing the heavier curtains at night, due to the fact that the window is so large that the outside air was cooling the room substantially, and was perfectly comfortable in the room after doing so. The beds and sheets were so soft and warm that I slept like a dream...The rooftop bar, Jimmy, is truly a sight to behold. Beautiful and comfortable furnishings, with an amazing view of not only Uptown, but looking out over the entire New York and New Jersey skyline. The bartenders and wait staff are great, and the martini was perfect...Guest services is perfect. I wasn't watching where I was stepping, and took a spill (scraping my face on the way down) across the street from the hotel on my second to last night there, and the door men ran across the street to pick me up. Not only did they help me back to my hotel room, but knew my name, had a manager come by with a first aid kit to clean me up, brought ice to my room, remembered that I had theatre tickets the next night and thereby had a makeup artist come to my room without any hassle on my part to take care of anything. V, the day door man, brought me extra chocolates to my room with a Get Well card an hour before the makeup artist showed up that next afternoon, so that I wouldn't be hungry if I got the munchies while getting my face fixed for the theatre... I could go on and on about the wonderfulness of the coffee and buns in the morning, the peacefulness of the hotel's own garden area, how it is perfectly located, and how much I cannot wait to go back when their restaurant is open. However, I will end with saying that this hotel is a treasure. Not only am I going back, but I am making this my home hotel in Manhattan. I love it. Do yourself a favor and go.

Let's start with the bad:The reservations team didn't do the hotel any favors. We called to make a reservation under the hotel's own promotional advertisement on its website. They were offering rooms at $349 a night with a complimentary breakfast as long as you booked by Nov. 1. Well, it took an hour long phone call to finally get the rate. They kept putting me on hold while they ""tried to get the rate."" Several times they claimed it wasn't possible to book, that there was a disclaimer that it was ""subject to availability."" There was no disclaimer. So basically they lied to me several times. When I finally asked to speak with another manager (I was already on the phone with one supposedly) they gave me the rate. The room was beautiful, but the floor and curtains were dirty. It appeared the room had been sitting since the construction was completed, and no one came in the room prior to our stay to tidy it up. The floor was dusty and there was dirt on the baseboards and curtains. The bathroom, however, was very clean.The doorman never showed up with our luggage. We waited 30 minutes and finally called down. He apologized and came right up. When he arrived, he had a cart to bring our luggage down. We informed him again that we were just checking in and not checking out. He made an excuse, apologized and ran down to get our luggage. Ten minutes later we had our luggage. This wouldn't have been a big deal, but we were very hungry, and wanted to grab a sweater before leaving the hotel. The extra wait threw our schedule off. The only other complaint I have is about the bed. The mattress was very comfortable, and the bed overall was very clean. But the comforter was not very heavy, and it was difficult to stay warm. It was october, and nights only dipped into the 50s, so I cant imagine what it would be like to have this in the middle of the winter.As for the good;The hotel is wonderfully located. We walked just about everywhere. The bathrooms were nice, and the rain shower is a nice touch.The staff (besides the reservations team) was very friendly, and willing to help. The hotel gave us a voucher for a free night's stay Jan-March because of the construction still ongoing at the hotel. It was a nice touch, though not sure I'd use it. All in all, a mixed bag. I might give this hotel another chance, but only if the prices were reasonable. Considering they are trying to get over $400 a night when the hotel isn't even completed, I doubt that will happen. We'll see.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","tcallquest</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",0,3.0

The test for the hotels is not only can they provide everything a hotel should provide, but can they also accommodate our bikes with ease? The James NY had only been open a couple of weeks when we tried it for our ongoing experiment, and I’m happy to report they passed with flying colors. Most of you will only care about the hotel part, but it may speak volumes about how they would handle your car, or your luggage, or any other “out of the ordinary” needs you may run by them.There were never any fewer than two people at the entryway, and they were friendly and smiling when we pulled up. One greeter immediately took our bikes, and the other our luggage (which we had rigged up to our bikes with a tram attachment). A woman at the desk explained that the check-in lobby was up the stairs. An elevator leading up there was not yet in service, but these bellmen (in particular, “V”) had absolutely no issue bringing our bikes, trams, and luggage up there for check-in. Thank you!The place appeared to be spotless and shiny new, yet lush and comfortable.We arrived a little before noon, and check-in is not until 3:00, however they happily upgraded us to a corner king, which was available immediately. Nice! While we checked in, “Dan” shook my hand, explained about the services (fitness center, lounge area with coffee and Danish in the morning, snacks all day, and wine, fruit, and cheese in the evenings, all complimentary). The lobby has pretty views, lots of glass, comfortable seating, and is clean, clean, clean. I was already impressed, and I hadn’t even seen our room yet.Up to our room, a corner king, on the 9th floor. Extremely plush, airy & open, just knock-out gorgeous. The James is at the corner of Grand & Thompson, and most of the buildings in the immediate area are relatively low-rise, so our corner view on the 9th floor was spectacular. Our bellman (sorry, I did not catch his name) explained how everything worked --- air conditioning, heated bathroom floor, shower, shades, docking station, etc. Room seemed very large, the space is intelligently laid out. Extremely comfortable king bed, a table and chair for dining/laptop/reading, a cushioned bench against the wall (next to the table) which we used both for seating and for a luggage rack, a mini-bar w/ fridge (with room to put our own beverages), and an absolutely spectacular bathroom! Actual shelving to put all our stuff! Many towels! Eco-friendly (and wonderful smelling) Harmonic products. Great lighting! Space galore! Nice big shower with two shower heads. One bathroom wall is glass, which faces into the room, but there is a shade that can be lowered with the push of a button if you’re the shy type.Every time we entered or exited the hotel, we were greeted by name, with a smile. Having been born and raised in NYC, we don’t need directions, but the staff did not hesitate to offer, always with a smile. I had the sincere feeling that these people enjoy their work; it really shows. The James knows how to hire staff.This is a five star hotel, without the precious ego & attitude that unfortunately follow so many hotels. We will, without a doubt, return again and again.","New York City, New York","call_me_a_cab</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",95,5.0

I booked a room for 2 nights, fully aware that they would have been opened 6 days when I checked in. Overall, my experience was great. Here are a few of the highlights. The location is awesome. It is right on the edge of SoHo so you can walk to everything but you aren't right in the middle of the hub bub that can be a weekend night downtown. The employees are gracious and courteous and if they don't have the answers to something, they will find out for you. Check in was a little confusing but I think it was a function of growing pains. The rooms are clean and while not super spacious, they are not small and they are very bright. It was a pleasure to have huge windows that overlooked the city and let some great light in to the room. Furnishings are minimalist but very comfortable. One word of caution though. Do not lie on the bed while wearing dark clothes. I think the hotel will quickly discover they have a serious lint problem with their linens. Bathroom was spacious and comfortable and I really like the amenities that they used. I am torn by the fact that they are full sized bottles that are anchored to the wall because I won't remember what they were when I get back but they were of excellent quality.Positives: Friendly Service, turn down service with Kee's Chocolates, filtered water by your bed, location, comfortNegatives: Slightly disorganized. Nothing in room that explains amenities offered by hotel including gym location, wifi information and local restaurant suggestions.
