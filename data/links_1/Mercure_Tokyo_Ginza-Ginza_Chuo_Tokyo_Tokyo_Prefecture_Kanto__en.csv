It's only about a 10-minute taxi drive from/to Tokyo Station. When you go out of the hotel, there are many convenience stores nearby (some of them 24 hours) and McDonald's (24 hours as well) and Starbucks are literally only a 10-second walk from the hotel. So you can never be deprived of food. If you walk a few minutes, you'll see many upscale or branded stores in Ginza. Yurakucho station is also literally on B1 floor of the hotel. Ginza Station is also only a 5-minute walk. Very convenient location.Staff were professional, friendly, and welcoming.We booked a twin superior room and although it's not spacious (hotel rooms in general in Tokyo are small), it's relatively bigger than the rooms in comparable 3-star or 4-star hotels in Tokyo, especially in Ginza. The twin beds are also a bit wider. Nevertheless, the room was clean and there were complimentary bottled waters refilled everyday.Breakfast was also very good. It served Japanese food and international selections.Overall, it was an excellent stay and we definitely would like to come back here next time we visit Tokyo.",,cypher_pakgo2019,22,5.0

I was so flustered that morning so I forgot my glasses. I didn't realize until I got to Narita Airport. I emailed them and they were just so helpful and let me know they found it. I flew back to the states when I got the email. I asked them to mail it back to me and I would pay the charges. The hotel staff wrapped my glasses so carefully in bubblewraps and then put it in a tin can so that it would get crushed during shipping.I mean, who gives this kind of customer service anymore?

We are Gold Accor members and we were really grateful to have a very early check in from around 9:00am as we were straight off a very early morning flight.Breakfast was a really good mix and choice of Western and Asian cuisine and they did change certain dishes every day which kept it interesting. Also we got discount off our breakfast being Accor members which made it really economical.We had the privilege rooms and they were well laid out and really spacious by all standards, they also came with complimentary mini bar snacks, juice and soft drinks.This was handy for hungry teenagers after a long day walking around Tokyo.We were also given drink vouchers for a complimentary welcome drink in the bar.We were greeted by a such a nice young man Kenichi who was most attentive and helpful, and to our delight and surprise when we asked if they had champagne they offered us a complimentary glass of Mumm, which was absolutely lovely. This was such a lovely way to celebrate being in Tokyo!We were also lucky enough to meet the Hotel Manager Hiroshi Sasaki, who was charming and happy to help in anyway, and gave us lots of suggestions on what to eat and what to do when we were in Tokyo. We did discuss the hotel needing a restaurant for dinner and or lunch and Hiroshi said they are working on it, but for now the restaurant only serves breakfast (which is really good).This hotel is a real gem in Ginza, its so conveniently located, it is just a few minutes walk to the subway and it is close to lots of cute little inexpensive eateries.

Best for us: There is an underground train entrance at the basement of this hotel and taking this, with one other transfer, gets you to Disneyland. Also, they graciously held our bags for us on our check out day for 6 hours without charge so we could spend our last morning and afternoon free. There is a McDonalds in the same block (open 24 hours and good for coffee or quick breakfast) and Lawson's store a half block away for sundries. A number of restaurants are within easy walking distance. Underground trains on the Ginza line are also within walking distance.",,laughingmeadow,1,4.0

Staff at front desk looked very aggitated and ingenue when informing us the unavailability of a room upgrade, very big serivce quality gap between the receptionlists with its peers from other Accor hotel we stayed during the same trip.In addition, for the first day, used glasses not washed, toilet bowl was not cleaned completely. I used an insurance card instead of the hotel room card to turn on the power, but the card was removed and disappeared without notifying me.Extremely unfriendly car parking, the car park said my car is more than 1.55 m height so I cannot park there. The front desk said we can park at Kabukiza theater instead but the car park said they have closed down for maintenance. I circled round and round at mid night to find a car park. Horroble experience.Breakfast:Breakfast place looks good, but the procedure of buying a breakfast voucher first at hotel reception instead of directly charging/billing at the restaurant is somewhat the first time I experienced and it is awkward and inconvenient for hotel guests. There are limited varieties of food but with touches from basic Japanese rice and soup, to hams/bacons/sausage/breads, some fried noodles, fruit and salad bar, some cereals, coffee and tea, which is in general commensurating with the price. I personally think the hotel should get a restaurant for lunch and dinner, however I do realize there are many restaurants (a ramen stall, a McDonald, a Starbucks reserve, many Japnese restaurants, one Italian restaurant) and two convenience stores (offer microwave heated food 24 hrs) nearby within 1 to 2 mins work.The welcome drink was non-alcohol at the bar which was pretty basic.The check out experience was satisfactory and the staff were helpful in the late check out request.

Prior to booking we read some negative reviews but we decided to book based on location. We booked a larger room based on the sizes listed on the website and found more than enough room to unpack and relax after our daily sight seeing marathons. Why would anyone reserve a small room and then complain when the information is clearly provided on the website? Every evening we retuned to a clean room with restocked toiletries and fresh towels if we requested. The AC was always working well in our room and I am usually too warm so this was perfect. The hallways were warm in the morning but since this accounted for 2-3 minutes of each day it was a non issue. Maybe the negative reviewers were sleeping in the hallway? The breakfast room was bright with a selection for a traditional breakfast like eggs, bacon, yogurt, bread, jam, pastries, as well as some Asian style choices such as dumplings, noodles, fish with some daily changes.

If you are feeling a little trifty, there's a McDonald's store and a number of convenience stores (Lawson, Family Mart, 7Eleven) just right across the corner.

The Grand room was good for family of 5pax, we were 3 adults and 2 kids aged 13 and 8. Snacks and beverages on the minibar were all complimentary. Coffee maker and tea pot were also available. My only comment is about the bathroom. It was quite small and the shower/ bath tub area on the room that we stayed in has no curtain so we were careful in taking a shower to prevent water spilling on to the bathroom floor. We stayed at Rm 1216. On our last night, we transfered to a standard room. It can only accomodate 4 pax. One of our kids joined their grandparents on another room. The room has the same size of bathroom. There was a shower curtain on the bathtub area. However, one of the cabinet door was off it's hinges and had tendency to fall off.

We ended up charging devices in the bathroom because they were the easiest power points to get to. I appreciated having the kettle in the room so I can make tea. Check in staff are excellent - truly some of the best I have interacted with over the many years I've been staying in hotels - and they go above and beyond what is normally expected of reception staff. The bar and dining area could do with a refit and I noted that only breakfast will be served in the restaurant after 30 April.

So, very convenient for shopping and getting around.Tokyo JR station is a bit farther – about 15-20 min by walk from Marunouchi South exit 八重洲南口. (It’s actually closer, ~10 min, via Exit 2 of Keiyu Line 京葉線but you’ll have to walk up 3 floors) – manageable as we didn’t have a lot of luggage but still less than ideal. The airport bus station at Ginza is closer (~7 min by walk), and it’s cheaper (1,000 yen versus well over 3,000 yen of Narita Express). So, we took the bus when we left for the airport.The room itself is also small but well-appointed – there’s even a smart phone available for our use in town (with free wi-fi and calls!)Overall, our stay there was satisfactory. But the price of this hotel is not cheap. If we don’t have to stay in the Ginza area, we might explore other options next time.","Iwate-machi, Japan","GL2018HK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Iwate-machi, Japan</strong>",2,4.0

Good access to transport links and Ginza itself is awash with fab restaurants for a variety of budgets (reserve in advanced if you can). We ate at Kushiyaki Bistro Fukumimi one night, it was fantastic and only a few hundred meters from the hotel. The staff were very helpful in booking restaurants, suggesting places to visit and were generally polite and courteous. There is no dining facilities after breakfast, but step out of the hotel and you don’t have to go far to find somewhere to eat. There is a bar, which opens from 3pm. Special mention to the breakfast staff who were all really welcoming and friendly; we found the breakfast to have a good selection of options and which were replenished frequently (the hotel was very busy when we stayed last weekend).

We stayed with friends for most of the time but as we also wanted some city centre time, we booked two nights at the Mercure Hotel in Ginza. The location is great - we arrived by public transport and the Ginza station is only a short walk away (there are several stations, depending on where you come from, check it out). We took the subway to Shibuya the next day and to some other spot the 2nd day so the location was very convenient and really close. The Tokyo station is around 15 to 20 minutes walk from the hotel. A quick note on Ginza: it has some really fancy department stores (if you are into luxury things, this will be paradise for you). There are some great restaurants nearby (around the corner there is some fried pork restaurant that is amazing or check out A Happy Pankcake (10 minutes walk - expect to queue for a table). The Imperial Palace (and the public Imperial East Garden) is around 15 minutes walk away. For anything else, use public transport - it will bring you there safely. Upon arrival we were given a very warm welcome, everything was prepared. We got an upgrade - something that is part of my Club Accor membership but at the same time can not be taken for granted (it happens that they are fully booked). I hardly get it in France but it seems that in Tokyo they took this very seriously! They were super friendly and we were quickly in our room on a high floor (as per our preferences). The room was super nice - I have been told that the hotel was renovated around October 2018. Please note that the room was of a very decent size - generally hotel rooms in Japan are small but compared to the room we had during the weekend with our Japanese friends (a small hotel in Kizarazu) it was really spacious. The room was very clean - we got a welcome bottle of wine and some delicious bisquits amongst some other small goodies (not sure if this is the standard or linked to my membership - but small gestures make a big difference for me). We walked 20 km every day to see some of the best places and it was so nice coming back to the hotel in the evening just to relax. The room was excellent for that purpose. The breakfast provided a good selection - I won't judge as I am really not into breakfast (that is the one meal I don't really need). It had everything we needed for a good start of the day - especially good coffee and friendly staff!Remember, this is a Mercure Hotel - not a 5 star palace but we felt like Queen and King and were totally happy. The day we checked out was my birthday and would you believe it they congratulated me before proceeding to check us out. I got a small gift and I was so happy. Again, a small thing but it made such a big difference for me. As we left our luggage in the hotel for the day, we had to come back to get it in the evening. I then met the Reception Manager and he again wished me a wonderful birthday. He knew everything - the fact that we were happy and also which colleague checked us in on Sunday. This is what I call attention to detail. I am sure when he reads this review he will remember - especially as during the holidays my attire is more like Heavy Metal than suit and tie oriented :-)It is a too bad that Tripadvisor does not allow me to give more than 5 points - Mercure in Ginza would so deserve it. Now I am back in France and guess what? I am writing this review from a Mercure Hotel in Tours. The service is somewhat different. As I choose the same hotels most of the time, they now give me the upgrade most of the time (big thank you) but no one would every say: Nice to see you again, thank you for your loyalty and so on. Asian countries (I have been to many countries around there, my wife is from Hong Kong) have a different attitude when it comes to service. Overall I can recommend the Accor Hotels (I would not stay with them otherwise) but the Mercure in Ginza is besides the Sofitel in Dubai my absolute favorite so far. Thank you for making a difference, thank you for contributing to a wonderful vacation and I am sure we will see each other again. Please thank all of your staff for everything they do - it makes a difference in peoples life.","Lyon, France","Unknown M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lyon, France</strong>",40,5.0

The Kabukiza is within walking distance as well.The provided smartphone makes exploring a breeze - it really is becoming an essential part of any hotel's offerings. Early and late checkouts are handy and not terribly expensive (well, compared to how much you have to pay for a room that has enough space for two suitcases lol). The wifi is very fast.It would have been nice to be able to get room service or eat dinner in an on-site restaurant. This hotel does not offer either of those options. I can accept that, but they leave paperwork (the usual ""hotel information"") in the rooms that vaguely says the restaurant will remain open until May, but they don't specify that they mean May 2018!They still do breakfast but it's fairly ordinary.

The hotel sits on top of the Ginza-Itchocme metro line (Just need to press B1 and you’re at the station). It is in a quiet spot that faces an office building, but just walk three minutes down the street and you are in the heart of the Ginza shopping district (Look for the LV store and turn in). And there are a 24-hour MacDonald’s and Lawson a minute away.However, be prepared that most of the rooms do not have much of a view (they face an office building so you can peek into the cubicles of office workers ) and there isn't a pool or onsen facilities. However, the hotel’s facilities are a winner. The lobby is designer chic and cozy. I stayed in a twin room that came with ample room - there was even a comfy armchair with leg rest and a fashionable overhanging lamp. The toilet’s bathtub is spacious by Tokyo’s standards and I like the overall design from the lift lobby. The bed rest also has a classy chic design, something that you don’t usually associate with budget business hotels My stay also came with breakfast that I looked forward to waking up to.

The location is terrific, just two blocks off the main shopping street of the Ginza. They were just finishing renovations so the lobby was closed off. However, all rooms were finished and noise was not an issue at all. Check in was easy and they held our bags for us until check in time. The staff was quite friendly and helpful. The room was exactly as you would expect in Japan--small, expensive (about $300 per night) but certainly more than adequate. We choose to have our suitcases on the floor since there was really no other place for them. There is a room safe, refrigerator, TV, nice sized bath including a super duper toilet with all the Japanese gadgets. But nicest of all, the room had a free smart phone that you could take with you while you toured the city. It also offered completely free calls to various countries including the US. It was a terrific touch especially since our older version phones did not work on the Japanese cell phone frequencies. We made sure to opt for the room package that included breakfast. Breakfast is on the second floor, is buffet style, and includes both Eastern and Western style breakfast items. The coffee was quite tasty out of their large custom coffee machine. We extended our check out by two hours--one they gave us free and one we paid an extra 1000 Yen (about $10). Your bill will also show an additional 400 Yen local tax which most likely was not already figured into your room rate.In terms of airport transportation, here's the deal. To Narita, where most international flights are, would be about $250 by taxi so not a good choice. There is bus service but the stop is not within easy walking distance with luggage. So, have the hotel call a taxi for you (tell them how much luggage you have so they call the right size) and take it to the Tokyo Station Yaesu South Entrance which will cost about 1000 Yen ($10). They can't enter the bus area but can drop you off about 50 yards south. Find bus platform #7 for The Access Narita bus which runs frequently and costs a mere 1000 Yen. They will take your bags and mark which airline you're flying so they unload them at the right stop. We used this on a holiday Monday so our driving time to Narita was a fast 55 minutes. Terminal 2 is where most of the flights are and it has 2 entrance doors so ask which stop is for your airline. American Airlines, for example, uses the first stop which is door 2.

First of all, its location is unbeatable. Easy to travel here from Narita via the Access Narita bus -- it costs only 1000 yen and drops you off at Sukiyabashi crossing in Ginza, some 550 meters away from the hotel. Sidewalks in Ginza are EXTREMELY clean and well maintained so you won't have any problem lugging your luggages. (The Access Narita bus has a very user friendly website that shows their bus stops at Narita, Tokyo station, and Ginza. Also, no need to buy tickets, just pay cash direct to driver.)Hotel is close to both Ginza station (with access to 3 Tokyo subway lines), around 5 mins walk away, and Ginza-itchome station, which has an exit at the hotel basement. From there, it was so easy for us to travel to the different tourist spots in Tokyo. The hotel is in a lovely quiet neighborhood and is just a stone's throw away from the main shopping highway. There are loads of designer names but also several middle-end stores like Uniqlo, Gu, Loft, Muji, Itoya stationery, ABC Mart (for sneakers), Hakuhinkan Toy Park, and a 24 hour Don Quixote. I was able to walk to Don Q at midnight, and felt very safe!! We also loved that there were a few Lawsons and a Family Mart nearby as well as a 24 hr McDonald's, for the late night munchies!!The hotel room was very clean, beds were firm and comfortable, and space was sufficient. Room came with a writing desk, ref and closet, as well as a spacious bathroom (and I believe this is exceptional for Tokyo hotel standards). Bathroom was pristine. My only gripe was the carpeting, which looked like it could use a good shampooing, and the aircon which took a long time to cool and felt warm at times. Hopefully they fix this with the current renovations.Staff were warm and pleasant and made us feel welcome. Regards to Estelita Kai who helped us during check out.

The corridors, reception areas and restraurant are drab. Staff are friendly and pleasant but with very limited English. Breakfast is chaotic: a wide but odd choice of food ( spaghetti and meatballs!) - which is often cold as it isn't replaced fast enough by the understaffed service. In fact I had the impression that the hotel - which is very popular with international visitors - is staffing at the bare minimum.The general management is French with the staff a mix of Japanese and some European. I got they were doing their best on a constrained budget. There are no staff to assist with bags for example and the reception is in the second floor.So it's the location - in the heart of the Ginza and at the centre of great transport links that sells. The hotel is in a side street so is very quiet despite the location - and there are no views beyond looking into the windows of offices.In summary - a mediocre hotel in a great location.

Ginza is more of an upmarket area selling brand names but the hotel is centrally located to rail network and downstairs is a 24 hr McDonalds ( not saying that a bonus but for the kids sometimes it's a welcome alternative ) . We didn't have any meals in the hotel as they were quite expensive and you can find a cheaper alternative in the side streets of Ginza in fact the hotel will give you a list of best eats in Ginza and a map of the Metro system . Your best to buy a Suica Rail card which is a card that you top up to pay for trips it's more cost effective and when you finish with it you get a refund of the small deposit . Back to the hotel the staff were knowledgeable but not super friendly and of course the language barrier didn't help .

Although the hotel was abit dated and had some prior complaints, I consulted with a few friends and fellow travellers to see if I should try it out. Thus, I decided to give it a go.Arrived around 11am on a Monday morning and was greeted by very friendly lobby staff. Although one small complain I will say is that they have no doorman to help you with your luggage when you arrived on the 1st floor. However that was nitpicking considering the 3 star ranking.Yumi behind the desk shared with us they are quite full this week and told us to give them awhile to see if they could push us for an upgrade. After awhile, indeed she found 1 room that we could be upgraded to however she shared with us that the room would be on the 3rd floor and that on my preferences, we preferred rooms on a high floor. That made me impressed to be honest as that shows the hotel actually take a look at your preferences when that check you in. Thank you so much Yumi!-Room-Our room was located on the 3rd floor (Room 318) and it was a Deluxe Room Twin Bed. The room size was okay in a sense that we were in Tokyo and hotel rooms in Tokyo aren't famous for being spacious. Yes, the rooms are dated with the old carpets and dated furniture. However to be fair they maintain them well as carpets are old but clean, furniture are dated but kept in good condition. Bath amenities are by Omnisens. Thus, no major complains there but of course new is always better. I understand that the hotel will be doing renovation soon. Thus, that will improve the situation they are in. -Dining-I had dinner at the hotel once and I must say, the food was E-X-C-E-L-L-E-N-T. The 4 Course dinner I had was absolutely. The ingredients used was fresh and the smell of the food was amazing. Would definitely recommend a meal here once if you have the time to do so. Thank you to Florent and Chris from the restaurant for being so helpful and welcoming to us while we were having our dinner.Breakfast buffet was small but food was generally delicious. No major complains here since breakfast was included in our rate and this wasn't the worst Mercure brekafast I had. No egg station though but the kitchen staff makes a good scrablmed eggs for the buffet line.-Location-Location was amazing though, just a 1-2 minute walk to the main street of Ginza. Thre are 3 Subway station surrounding the hotel. The closest one which has direct acces to the hotel is Ginza Itchome Station and the other two station are about 5 mins walk away are Ginza Station and Higashi Ginza Station. I cannot recollect which station it is but one of those station has a direct train to Haneda Airport.-Overall-Overall my stay was above average. Yes the rooms are old but they maintain them well. The price I paid per night was competitive but I understand at certain periods of time, the hotel can be expensive and overpriced in my opinion.Thus if you get the hotel room rate you want at the correct price, I believe its a good deal. Although not the best Mercure I have been to, niether is it the worst. It slots right in the middle and I would return to this hotel if I come back to Tokyo and want to stay at Accor.","Sydney, Australia","MaxLYZ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",155,4.0

The Ginza subway is literally just around the corner (2 min walk), and when I left I took a taxi to Tokyo main station to catch the Narita Express, and I would say it was only about 20mins to the station by taxi (also to the main business district, which is where my meeting was).Bedroom was OK size, quiet and reasonably clean, with decent wifi, but otherwise a bi shabby.Staff and breakfast buffet both excellent ","London, United Kingdom","firkinboo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",45,4.0

There are also many dust at the shelve and housekeeper not kept back my towel.- Accor's member benefit. (Strongly not recommended to stay this hotel)In this hotel, you will not get the good benefit such as room upgrade. If compare with Thailand. They will always guaranteed upgrade at least one step but mostly if platinum member they will always two steps upgraded.- RoomRoom is quite old, not beautiful and the cost per night is opposite than its quality. If I have to pay with my own money I will not book this hotel for sure. There are a lot of good hotels in that area and absolutely not to choose here.- Restaurant.I had one meal in lunch time of France restaurant in this hotel. The tall guy in the restaurant gave very stupid service and he looks like don't care Thai people. Breakfast also stupid as everyday foods almost the same and bad quality.- Check out performance.According to I have very early flight and I had a lot of snacks and beverages in minibar. They invoice me very cheap and they really don't know what I have eat from the minibar and the staff did everything not very professional about this then I have to told and shown from my list that what I have had from minibar.Finally, I would like to invite the management to come to Thailand as internship or try to stay just only one night in Thailand hotel. You will see that the performance and quality of hotel in Thailand is perfectly and Japan can not beatable. It is like a 10 years past of the service quality away from Thailand.

Amenities quite basic, but we're annoyed with Mercure standard [read : soap], because in other hotel we stayed while in Tokyo, the shower gel / soap were very abundant, and being Mercure, the soap, shampoo, and conditioner're being kept in a small tube, and they only provide two.

Ginza is truly spectacular and offers restaurants to suit all your tastes. Obviously McDonalds is handy for a snack or icecream, we found a cheap Japanese noodle bar near Higashi-Ginza called Ippudo. Also Rump Cap just around the corner from the hotel serves steak and lovely food with a 400 yen cover charge. This hotel is extremely well located for all your travels into central Tokyo and a Pasmo card is well worth the money to save buying tickets every day. It's approx 200yen and 20 minutes to all of the main sights, depending on which metro line you take. The local shops are fantastic and all within minutes from the hotel. We contacted the manager by email in advance as we bought a BMobile 5gig 21day sim card for data only from the UK. The hotel replied the next day and said they were happy to receive the package and all 3 were handed to us at check in. This meant we had data for our phones and more importantly google maps and the best app - Tokyo Subway for IOS. It details the subway stops and is a must for the metro.We travelled using a Japan Rail card and the hotel kindly held onto one of our suitcases until we returned which was very helpful. Tokyo rail station is 10minutes in a taxi and cost 600 yen which was brilliant value, we hailed one right outside the hotel if you turn right and walk to the family mart small supermarket.

My expectations were pretty low, but this hotel was surprisingly good, a solid 3.5 star property that could improve to 4 stars with a few tweaks and staff training.Positive:- Location in Ginza is very nice. Lots of high class shops, nice backstreets to explore. It is a great area. Hotel has a direct link to railway station. - Rooms are bigger than expected and have everything you need. It felt quite comfortable. Good shower, comfy bed, adjustable AC. Needs Improvement:- the breakfast buffet is pretty bad for western taste. Most annoying was that they cut each slice of bread in half, and only put out about 5 slices, 10 pieces at a time. It was constantly empty and we were asking for more bread every 5 minutes. One day they ran out and said no more. Really??? Adding to the annoyance factor was that because the bread was cut in half it would get lost in the toaster and would pop up. You were constantly trying to dig it out of a hot toaster. We were not the only people getting annoyed each morning!- we ate at the restaurant one night, too tired from a day of sightseeing to venture out. The service was pretty amateur, the waiter couldn't remember the specials, the wrong deserts were served. The food was OK, but not overly memorable.

It was also very quiet throughout the night which was a god send when trying to sleep through the jet lag! The daily complementary water was an added bonus when returning from a long day in the Tokyo heat! The room was a little bit basic but why would you need an amazing room when you are in one of the most amazing cities in the world! The location is definitely the best thing about this hotel. Only a 15 minute walk to the main Tokyo station where you will find the bullet trains and around a 10 minute walk to the ginza subway line which can get you to pretty much anywhere in the city ! There is a station directly under the hotel but wasn't the best for the sights of Tokyo! The shopping district of ginza is literally around the corner where you will find all the designer shops and hundreds of restaurants ! (The difficulty is picking one ! ) and there is a mc Donald's attached the same building as the hotel which is particularly handy on a late flight when you are jet lagged and starving !!! There is also a supermarket around the corner too! A little hint - don't change any currency at the hotel !! They completely rip you off ! We where desperate so changed £100 but instantly regretted it when finding a much much higher rate outside (122 offered by the hotel - 141 outside ) ! There are a lot of exchange places around the shinjuku and shibuya area ! 5 nights definitely wasn't long enough and we will definitely be returning to this hotel and to Japan in the near future! ,,Natalie M,13,4.0

To stay at the Mercure you are approx 5-7 minutes walk from Ginza Subway (3 lines) , Higashi-Ginza Subway (2 lines), you will find these a better option or with Tokyo main station (terminus for all Bullet Trains) approx 15 minutes easy walk away . Note that the Mercure is located on the Yaesu side of Tokyo Station all the Bullet Trains and buses use that side, very handy. Reception is on 2nd floor (note that in Japan they don't have ground floors that is called 1st floor). Check in was quick and informative, a large % of the staff are European both in the restaurant and in reception so languages are not an issue.We had booked a Superior double room, which when allocated was on the 10th floor. The rooms are not large but manageable, we had 2 large suitcases plus a plane locker bag and we worked around them very well. The beds where comfortable and all the amenities first rate. Breakfast has a good spreed of western food and you can order eggs as you want them from a waiter. We used the Accor card which gave us 50% discount on breakfast. Convenience stores are located both sides of the hotel entrance, turn right walk past McDonald's and you have a Lawson s Store, turn left over the road and there is a 7/11. If you kept going past the 7/11 till the street ends in a T junction turn left and you will find an Indian restaurant ( upstairs)which is good food at a reasonable price.

The bad: 1) Housekeeping didn't clear out old dishes and sheets from the day before (it lay where it was). We were with kids so the sheets had food stains which weren't replaced. I will upload photos shortly. 2) We got free drinks coupons for the bar and were told it was open till 10pm. On arriving at 9:40pm, the person at the bar told my husband rudely, that he could not serve us. The front desk gave us bottled wine as a compensation. Not cool! 3) The 'grand' breakfast: cold scrambled eggs. No mention of a live egg station. One kind of bread? DO NOT BE FOOLED INTO BUYING THIS. Plenty of cute cafes around the hotel! 4) Reception is on the first floor. And luggage is self-serve, so no luggage trolleys on the ground floor- which means if you're with a big group ie 10 people (10 bags) it is very difficult! 5) The elevator DOES NOT DETECT your hand etc when closing. Be careful!The ugly: 1) Being Platinum club Accor members (I had my wedding at Sofitel L'Imperial in Mauritius), our room wasn't ready until 5:30pm on the day of check in! We lost an entire afternoon in Tokyo! 2) Centrally-controlled energy saving air conditioning timings which went off in the middle of the night, much to the chagrin of my parents, both of whom suffer heart problems and claustrophobia.

We've had an otherwise great experience dealing with other Accor hotels, having celebrated my sister's wedding at the Sofitel L'Imperial in Mauritius, and have frequented other Accor brands in and around India. We stayed in four rooms (2 queen bed and 2 twin bed non smoking rooms). I was shocked to hear when we reached the hotel that our rooms were yet not ready for us to move. Forget the fact that we had platinum membership and all the privileges the membership has to bestow upon its members, we had 3 children, as well as we had a lot of bags and had departed from Kyoto early that morning. We were finally able to move in at 530 pm! Yes our entire day got wasted just hopelessly waiting in the lobby. Additionally we were told by the Club Accor representatives on the helpline, before we reached, that we would get upgraded as we were platinum members, but the hotel said they were ""fully booked"" (although booking.com and other websites clearly showed there were rooms available, and in fact we booked our fourth room at the hotel itself). It's definitely a business hotel and don't expect any bell-boys to transfer luggage to your room as it's self-service. Even when we went to the bar to avail of the free welcome drinks given to us as Platinum members, we were rudely turned away as the bar shut at 10 pm (we reached at 9:30 pm). We alerted the front desk, and they hurriedly rescued the situation and sent wine bottles to our room. The thermostat in the rooms were a bit messed up, and the air-conditioners were definitely not working. It kept randomly switching off in the middle of the night, which made it uncomfortable. When alerted the problem to the Front desk, they put an ""air-purifier"" in the room saying this is all they had. As retribution for all the mess ups, the hotel decided to give us free full breakfast for one day, which we kind of regretted taking, as it was quite bland, and there are some real nice cafetarias near the hotel. Apart from all the above mishaps, the hotel is located in probably the best location in Tokyo- the centre of the hustling and bustling Ginza area, & all the biggest shops/stores are a stones-throw away. Their customer/quality manager Mr. Nikita Dimitriev is indeed a gem of person, and tried his best to salvage the situation we were in. He personally came with us to the Ginza station and helped us to book our daily metro tickets. He was very understanding, although he could not do much. The complimentary celebratory wine and champagne was much appreciated by all of us. Really the only bright spark in our entire stay unfortunately. Hopefully this hotel repairs it's image and makes it more comfortable to other travellers and tourists. As a Platinum LeClub member was thoroughly disappointed that we had a stay with quite a few hiccups.","Mumbai, India","Anish90</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, India</strong>",24,3.0

We enjoyed staying there based on the location, price and cleanliness. However we had a terrible experience with the staffs while we were there.We stayed there 24-26 December and 30 December - 01 January 2017.On 25 December, we decided that we would be having breakfast at the restaurant. Breakfast was not included but because we were accor member, we were told that the we would be given a buy one get one free.While we were eating, the restaurant staff asked how we would like to pay. My dad decided to pay cash to to the waiter. We gave him 4,400 YEN for the four of us.The next day, we left very early (5.30 AM) because we had to catch the 6AM Shinkansen to Nagano. We tried to check out and were held by the receptionist. She said that we haven't paid for the breakfast. We tried explaining and the lady understood and since we had another booking for the 30th, we said that we can continue this then as we were in a hurry. And we couldn't be late because we've booked a day tour in Nagano which we have paid full and unrefundable.Thanks to that, we almost missed our train. We got to the track just 7 minutes before departure.On 30 December, we returned to Tokyo to stay at the same hotel. The receptionist lady (a different one) told us we haven't paid for breakfast. We explained to her and she said she will confirm with the waiter and erase the bill from their system. We though that everything was OK.01 January, we were checking out and needed to catch a train to Narita airport for our flight. GUESS WHAT? We were billed again for the breakfast.We tried explaining to the receptionist and he wouldn't listen and understand. He kept saying not according to the system, it's not in the system, the system said bla bla bla. Sick of it, we asked him to bring out the waiter from the restaurant.The waiter came, and CONFIRMED OUR STORY. He said ""yes indeed I remember receiving exactly 4,400 YEN from you. I remember because you had so many ACCOR cards and we made a joke about it.""The receptionist still didn't want to hear any of it and kept going about how we couldn't leave until we settle the bill. We decided we had enough and said we are going and left him there with his jaw wide open.A few days later, we received an email billing us (AGAIN!) for the bloody breakfast.My dad asked me to write directly to the manager and accor explaining our situation and FINALLY the bill was written off along with apologies from the hotel.And of course, we made it to the train tracks just under 5 minutes before departure.

As it was we had a decent room (although not upgraded) and enjoyed our stay in what proved to be a good location.The hotel doesn’t have a reception at ground level, you need to take the elevator one floor up. One floor below is a metro line, but that line didn’t seem to be useful for getting anywhere and we usually walked to a nearby metro station on a different line.The entrance is down the side street to the right of hotel as seen in the picture below.The reception desk were helpful and spoke English. As we’d arrived late afternoon, our room was ready.It wasn’t anything special, but it was more than we expected after reading about small rooms in Japan. We were completely spoiled by our next room in the Hilton Osaka and so I’m glad we did this first.There was a safe, tea/coffee, kettle, really small tea cups and a mini bar, although I could see a miniature Jack Daniels whisky was 1200 Yen – the local convenience store was selling half bottles of Suntory whisky for 500 Yen so better to walk around the corner and pick one up from there. That local store was open 24 hours should you need anything.The bathroom was a decent size, shower over a bath, heated mirror and a Japanese electronic toilet. The shower feed was from two separate taps and not a mixer tap or shower control, something I thought was peculiar to England, so it was difficult to get the shower at the right temperature.The towels were always smelly after use and so we were always leaving them on the floor for replacement each day.The free Wi-Fi worked well as did the room air con.Breakfast was included in our rate. The small breakfast room is on the same floor as reception. We never had a problem getting a table and the staff were friendly. There was a good selection of both Western and Japanese food, plus some weird mixtures such as scrambled eggs next to spaghetti bolognaise.One reason for choosing this hotel was the location. It was great to be able to walk around the local area, luxury shopping streets, good local restaurants and not far from the famous fish market and easy to pick up a metro and go sightseeing.Checkout was smooth and the receptionist was also able to arrange for our large suitcase to be delivered to the Hilton Osaka for the equivalent of $60 which I think was pretty good value.

This year we stayed at the Mercure Ginza for our third consecutive year and must admit that you will not find a better base for a holiday in Tokyo. We have found that our holidays here are relaxed and we feel safe wandering around the area at any time, day or night - even walking to the Tsukiji Fish Markets at 2.30am.We have easily explored our way around Tokyo from here - our best advice, buy a Suica or Pasmo Card at the station when you arrive and use the subway. You won’t need to buy tickets - pay 500 yen deposit, top it up as you go and get the deposit & balance refunded at the end of your stay. You can hop on the subway at various stations near the Mercure, we favour Ginza (exit A13) and Yurakucho Stations. If you are a train spotter, sit on platform 4 at the latter to view a constant stream of Shinkensens passing by. It is an easy walk from the hotel to Tokyo Station where you can catch a Shinkensen, for trips out of the city.A regular route for us, to and from the hotel, was via the basement of the Matsuya store next to Ginza exit A13, to pick up food - you are so spoilt for choice here. For drinks, ice creams and snacks - when you exit the hotel - there is McDonalds and a Lawsons on the first corner to the right and then a Family Mart and a Lawons Natural on the first corner to the left. Tomod’s Pharmacy is close by and is very cheap for cold drinks.The hotel is right by Chuo Dori which has all of the major shops but … make sure you walk up and down the smaller parallel back streets. You will discover wonderful restaurants, cafes and amazing bakeries as well as countless boutique stores and ‘name brand’ stores - they are all waiting for you to find them.We were pleased to re-acquaint ourselves with the wonderful staff at the Mercure Ginza, they always provide you with great customer service. There is a new manager at the hotel this year so it will be interesting to see if this will be a change for the better … look out for our post around June next year as we have already booked to stay there for another month in 2017.We are happy to answer any questions you may have about the hotel and its surrounds – we know it well.","Sydney, Australia","The2Taggarts</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",28,5.0

Our room was a deluxe twin (advertised as 24m2), and I was positively surprised, as it can easily beat some European capital hotel rooms.Japanese chains (Mitsui Garden or Tobu, not to mention) will offer a much much smaller room for not always a cheaper price.This said, two things are obvious :1) ""Mercure"" is an unknown brand. My japanese friend even mistook with Monterey Hotel next door ...2) Location is great if you need to be in the eastern part of Tokyo. Ginza, Yurakucho, Imperial garden are all within reasonable walking distance. Many subway stations are around, and even one of them is accessible directly from the hotel elevator.The building occupies one face of a small alley parallel to Ginza avenue, and therefore, all room face the opposite building 9m away. Don't expect a romantic view ;-)On the positive side, all rooms are very calm.Exterior entrance : Pay attention, as you can easily go past thinking that the discreet double door is a backdoor. (FYI, there is no doorman.)If ever you come by car, parking fee is 2500JPY per day (25USD, one entry) which is a steal in this neighborhood, but height is limited to 1m55.Front desk : The reception is accessed by elevator, and you really wonder if this is really a hotel entrance.There are three counters, and one small sofa with tea / coffee (self service). As the area is very small, it can't support many people at the same time.There always seems to be a non-japanese staff.Room :The deluxe room is spacious enough (but perception may differ).The decoration is quite modern though there were some scars / stains on the wall. The main pieces of furniture are :> 2 beds (1m20 x 2m) for twin rooms> 2 armchairs with stool and a small table> a closet (33cm width) and a wardrobe (55cm width), which should be enough for the majority of us staying no longer than a week in Tokyo.> 25' flat TV ; rather small, but OK.> work desk along the window (1m40 x 0m50) with a desk chair ; comfortable enough to work if you don't have too many documents spread around.Bathroom :That's the disappointing point.It is clearly a japanese ""unit bath"" (prefab bathroom module) disguised as a proper bathroom. But some signs are unmistakable : 1) same yellow plastic used for bathtub, ceiling, floor and walls, 2) raised floor for the pipes (inside height is therefore 2m00 ...), 3) cheap thick shower curtain.The advantage is that you can splash as much as you want, because the Japanese typically shower themselves out of the tub (the tub should remain clean).Some details try to elevate the perceived quality : ceramic tiled wall, ceramic basin (but cracked), wicker basket, marble designed table ...You may have fun with the ""washlet"" (shower toilet). That's one of most remarkable japanese inventions which can also be found in public places.Former room occupants clearly tried to peel off the instructions as a souvenir (but didn't succeed).Amenities :> japanese pajama (improperly called ""kimono"" by foreigners), large persons won't fit> branded shampoo and shower gel.> toothbrush (japanese size = very small brush)> 2 small bottles of waterEquipment :hair dryer, safe, minibar, tea stuffnespresso (probably not in all rooms)Breakfast :It is taken at the french restaurant at the same level as the reception. The room is quite small, but we didn't need to wait.You have a continental offer (with some good pain au chocolat) and simple japanese offer. It's not sophisticated and the choice is limited, so don't pay extra for it if it is not included in your rate. You have many choices in the vicinity : convenience stores, fast food, coffee shops, etc.Platinum members : can get the usual free beverage coupons and a mini-bottle of champagne. As this hotel has a french origin, we were positively surprised to get real stuff from the Champagne region, and not some fake lousy bubbly. On the negative side : it's not offered proactively ; you have to ask for it.Overall :> large room compared to similar priced japanese chains> extremely conveniently located> nice staff> ""cheap"" bathroomWe may regret the absence of a very convenient executive lounge, as, even similarly space scarce Hong-Kong is offering it (Novotel Nathan Road).Will we come back again ? Most likely.The room itself deserves a 4 points. But, considering competitors' offer, price and location, it is definitively an excellent choice.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","TPK751</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",86,5.0

Unfortunately, we arrived later than expected at the standard check-in time of 2:00pm. Not only was our room not available at the standard check-in time, but we had to wait an additional 45 minutes in the lobby while the staff fumbled about trying to determine how to handle it. It was not a great start to our stay.Room: Leading up to the room, the hotel's halls looked old with bunched up carpet and older wall art. Our room was average. Despite the room type, we only had a view of the outside wall of a neighboring building. Everything was clean and orderly. The room comes with a safe and small refrigerator. The TV was one of the smallest I've seen in a room at this hotel's price point, but it worked fine. We upgraded to a deluxe room to have some additional space for my son to play. I'm glad we did because I don't think the superior room, if smaller, would have been a good choice for us. The bathroom was very nice and it came with premium toiletries. Location: The hotel's location is maybe it's best characteristic. It is located with easy access from the local metro line. Ginza's main shopping street and great restaurants are just a short stroll away. There are two Lawson convenience stores and a Starbucks within 100 feet of the entrance. It is perfectly suited for soaking up all that Ginza has to offer.Hotel Food:We booked our room rate with the included breakfast from the 2F restaurant. The breakfast buffet was good with Western and Japanese selections. There was cereal, yogurt, fruit, different breads, eggs, bacon, and sausage, among other selections. I was pleased with everything we were offered. Overall:I am an Accor hotel rewards member, so I would consider this hotel again, but not without checking to see what other options exist in the area.

This hotel fit the bill perfectly. We arrived shortly after 10am and only had to wait 15 minutes before getting an available room. Thankfully early check-in is one of the benefits of Accor Platinum status. Our room, 1018 was on the 10th floor overlooking the street outside. The room was very well appointed and had all the modern day amenities one would come to expect. As I received a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe room, it was quite large. We had a Nespresso coffee machine, fridge, safe, two large beds, bathtub/shower combo, heated toilet with the butt-washing feature and a wide range of toiletries. The only item missing that we had to request was an iron an ironing board. Staff at front desk can speak both Japanese and English which was welcomed. Even in the restaurant, the level of English spoken by staff was fantastic. The WiFi network worked flawlessly throughout the property and we found the Lobby network which powers the reception area and restaurant was much faster. I clocked download speeds of 30MB and upload speeds of 22MB when on floor two.Breakfast wasn't included in our room rate and we only had breakfast twice in our five day stay. It isn't particularly cheap at ¥2200 per adult. The food was very good and had a good range of Western and Japanese options available both times we went. I would highly recommend this property in the trendy Ginza area of Tokyo as a nice base for a holiday. The nearest Metro station was Ginza and the nearest JR line station was Yuracucho on the Yamanote line. Getting here from the airport was very easy and straightforward. We bought Japan Rail Passes ahead of time and exchanged them at the ticket office at Haneda when we arrived. I would admit, the wait time there was almost an hour which wasn't ideal after coming off a 12 hour flight. Nonetheless, once we got them, we were onto the Monorail to Hamasutcho and then switched to the JR Line to Yuracucho and the walked 8-10 minutes to the hotel. While it's true that the Ginza station is closer to the hotel, the JR Rail Pass is non accepted on the metro. We bought a separate 72 hour metro pass for ¥1500 at the BIC Camera store for that made sure we got our money's worth. BIC is just outside Yuracucho if you're interested in getting one. You must present your passport to get it as they are only sold to tourists. Thank you Mercure for an excellent stay in Japan and you will be at the top of my list next time I return to Tokyo.

I stayed in a both a normal and deluxe room, and the only visible difference was complimentary water and better bathroom accessories - neither are that big a deal. Breakfast is where this hotel lets itself down though. There is a reasonable selection, but I think its an area that could be improved.

This hotel has a fantastic location in Ginza, close to subway and train lines, great high end shopping and food options in the depato. It is set back two blocks from Chuo-dori, so our view was ok but not scenic. We were split between two rooms (not connected), and both were super clean and comfortable although a bit small as is the standard in Japan. Breakfast was good and staff did a good job of restocking and all were very pleasant. There were 2 issues that we had while staying here. First was the temperature of the rooms. The thermostats were set at 28 degrees Celsius. After much discussion at reception (after trying myself with the controls in the room) I was made to feel incompetent for asking if the room could be made cooler. She eventually reset our rooms to a lower temp and told me not to touch the controls during our stay. Then, the next morning the phone rang in our room and the front desk was asking if we could pay our accommodation in full. We still had another 2 nights to stay, and are also Accor members and booked through our membership. No explanation was given for this. We payed but thought it was a strange request.

The lobby was very small and dark, which made it looked smaller. But then the staffs were very professional and efficient. Check in was smooth and i got a room right away.Now the room, i stayed at superior room with queen bed, the room was small just like typical hotel room in Tokyo, low ceiling, and again dark interior just like the lobby. Maybe someday when this hotel wants to renovate, I suggest a bright or maybe white interior to make the room feels larger, just like the bathroom, all white with large mirror, didn't feel small at all. No complimentary mineral water in room, make sure you get one before come to the hotel.The best feature of the hotel is location. Located in a quiet area of ginza but only steps away from the hustle and bustle of ginza shopping paradise.

I certainly recommend Mercure Ginza include clearer directions on how to get to the hotel from Ginza station as that is the easiest station to alight from if coming from the Airport. For those interested - A13 (no escalator), put Apple Store on your left (other side of road) and walk to Bulgari, turn right and walk a couple of blocks till you see the pillar with the Mecure sign - turn right. If you hit McDonalds you've gone too far. The entrance is a small double glass down with a menu and mini flags out the front - I thought it was the hotel restaurant the first time I saw it, not the actual hotel.I never caught the Yurakucho Line so all the comments about the hotel being over the Ginza - itchome station were irrelevant. For connectivity, Ginza station is by far worth the extra couple of hundred metre walk.Food wise, breakfast wasn't worth the cost imho, and given the amount of great and cheap food in the vicinity I'd skip that unless included in an offer. I didn't eat at the hotel for other meals.My room was a single and while smaller than I was expecting (even expecting a small room), it was adequate especially as I spent so little time in the hotel it didn't matter.The proximity to Ginza Station, the easy walk to the huge range of Gado Shita (mini restaurants under the railway over pass with <$2AUD per beer and amazing food) makes this hotel a good choice.However I don't think I would stay here again as the cost is greater than the benefits of location given the ease of use of the metro.","Brisbane, Australia","Taezar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",104,4.0

The extremely friendly staff got us right into our room which was a wonderful relief. The room was very clean and comfy. We had a double bed room, the room was small but that is what you get in Tokyo so don't expect more for a good price. The room was cleaned nicely everyday when we came back from our activities. When we checked in we received 10% off coupons for the breakfast buffet to use each morning of our stay. That was appreciated. The buffet with the coupon costs about 2000 yen per person and offers a good selection of both American and Japanese foods and the staff is very quick to clear your empty dishes. The breakfast is charged to your room and you pay upon checkout. I would also like to add that the entire staff was very accommodating when it came to speaking English with us. We can only speak some Japanese. The staff that we encountered spoke English very well which alleviated some stress. Another added bonus is that the basement level of the hotel leads directly to the subway. You can take the elevator directly down into it! That was a huge relief after multiple hours or walking. All in all I would definitely stay here again if I ever had the opportunity and would recommend others to do the same. ",,Missjill603,2,5.0

I had to switch the aircon on and off for it to work since it stopped working when the inverted E appeared. The following day, I showed the photo of the aircon display to the person at the front desk and requested for a room change for our rooms which they graciously did. It was only on the 4th and 5th night that we slept comfortably in our rooms. The room and bathroom were clean and kept tidy during our stay. Pillows were kind of flat. There were good restaurants in the area. The staff at the reception were approachable and were helpful in giving directions to go to different places around the city.

If you are after a good hotel with a family friendly feel to it and right in the heart of Tokyo … this is it!The rooms are a good size for Tokyo, provides all the usual amenities, has large windows giving plenty of light in the room, is very clean and the beds are really comfortable. It is a quiet hotel located in a safe area to walk around, be it day or night.The dining room is intimate - the staff are very friendly and efficient, and a great source of information. The breakfast buffet has a good balance of eastern and western choices, the lunch is a buffet and provides the option to choose from a lighter smaller selection or to have access to the full buffet, the dinner menu is French focused and offers an excellent selection - our tip for dinner, consider choosing from the specials of the day - there is one in each category of food, they are very reasonable (1,000 to 1,800 yen), freshly prepared and all delicious. The chef regularly comes out to chat to his evening diners and enquire how they are enjoying their meal. There is a small bar and coffee area annexed to the dining area.The General Manager, Kamel Senhadji, is to be commended for the quality of his team and the excellent service they provide to guests. Mr Senhadji introduced himself to us and we found him to be very amicable and genuinely interested in hearing our views relating to the hotel. If you have even the slightest problem or a request, his staff ensure that it is addressed immediately.Javier Piqueres Fayos and all of the reception staff are extremely obliging and will provide you with maps and information to get you to your intended destination. We found the best ‘go to’ information they provided was contained in the hotel vicinity map, the coloured subway map and the Tokyo Handy Guide - don’t leave the hotel without them. The hotel is close to three subway stations - Ginza Station (exit A13) was our regular – and we strongly recommend using the subway system and also buying a Pasmo or Suica prepaid transportation card. The nearby subway system provides easy access to all major tourist attractions in Tokyo.This hotel is so convenient – it is only several minutes from the main Ginza shopping street, where you are spoilt for shopping choices and you can shop at the original and biggest Uniqlo store in the world. The ornate Ginza Kabukiza Theatre, the Imperial Palace and the Tsukiji Fish Market & outer market are must see attractions and within walking distance from the hotel.If you exit the hotel and go right - there is a McDonalds at the corner, a Lawson store directly across the road from the corner, turn right and there is a Starbucks just down on the left. Then a little further on the right are a St Marc Café and a Douter Café, both good to pick up a quick beverage / snack. If you exit the hotel and go left - there is a Family Mart and a small Douter Café near the corner.The basement levels of the Matsuya and Mitsukoshi Department Stores which are both close by, have an extensive selection of reasonably priced take away food – such as sandwiches, a wide variety of hot food, cakes, pastries, grocery items, alcohol and … the list goes on. There are also many small eateries and restaurants close by and reception will provide you with a recommendation list they have compiled – however make sure you try the hotel dining room, it is very reasonable and has excellent meals.Tip - Japanese politely queue for EVERYTHING ... so don’t queue jump - even on a platform when you are waiting for a train.","Sydney, Australia","The2Taggarts</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",28,5.0

I checked in on the 3rd day of the new year and was given welcome gifts; reason being the welcoming of the new year. The size of the room impressed me as Japan hotel rooms are not known to be big. Toiletries were good but I didnt get the ladies' toiletries that was mentioned by some TA contributors. What is unusual about the bathroom is you need to take a step up to the bathroom. I missed the step one day coming out of the bathroom and fell onto the carpet flooring almost hitting my head against the wardrobe. There was the usual beverage making facility and they provided a good selection of green tea, English and strawberry tea. The hotel can be reached by taking the Yurakucho line to the Ginza itchome subway station which is directly below the hotel. During my stay, I took this line to avoid getting wet in the rain. Beware though the hotel entrance and exits of this line closed at 10 pm. As I walked through the station at 9.30 pm one evening, I saw several station masters patrolling the station which gave me a sense of uneasiness being the only passenger. It was as if the station was going to be locked down any moment. McDonald's is just next to the hotel by taking the lift down to the basement so if you ever feel hungry, it is open as late till 11 pm. Hotel card is required to operate the lift to the floor level of your room so there is some level of security assurance since the public can easily gain access to the hotel from the basement level and subway station level. Walking the streets of Ginza in the late night was exhilarating and very safe as one get to enjoy the New Year lightings with no crowds to bother you in picture taking. Despite the hotel being located in obviously a high class area with many couture brands being represented, it was sad to see an aged homeless man sleeping in the open near McDonald's huddled up with only an aluminium shield round his legs to protect him from the cold winter amidst his personal belongings. Throughout my three night stay at the hotel, this homeless man did not move a single step away from his makeshift home.There wasn't a wide selection of food served at breakfast but since it was complimentary, I am not complaining either. Despite signages at the lifts forewarning guests about the expectant queues at breakfast, I encountered crowds only one out of the three days I was there.It was overall a good comfortable stay and my perception of Accor service has changed that I booked a stay at the Hotel Ibis Bencoolen Singapore the following week.

I am little bit afraid if they don't have room that can accommodate us. All my children below 12, so I cannot let them stay in separate room. When check-in as AAP member, we request and inform our problem and the staff is help us to upgrade to deluxe room which is usually enough for 2 adult and 2 children to accommodate us. And what is nice to us is after 7 hours flight you would like to enter your room immediately and thanks to the friendly staff that help us to check-in early since there is a room ready for us. You could imagine us, two adults with 3 children below 12 years old (5, 8, 9 years) in a room perhaps 25m2. Its little but enough for us, and we are happy with the room. Very clean, nice, free wifi, even they have iPod dock in room and other in-room facilities as Mercure Class Hotel. Our children also happy and feels at home.Now the story that never expected began in family holidays. After taking rest I realize that my younger kid start to get fever in the afternoon, perhaps due to cold in winter. We then give him paracetamol medicine to reduce his fever but its not happen, and suddenly after high fever for 3 hours in the night, He start seizure (first time in his life) and immediately I call front desk to call an ambulance. In this story, I would like to thanks so much to Ms. Fukushima-san who immediately call an ambulance and in few minutes Ms. Fukushima-san and paramedic entering our room and help my son. As a Hotel staff her english is very good and she translate all our conversation between paramedic and us. Then we go to hospital with paramedic and get some medical help from International Hospital near the hotel. Once again this hotel is very recommended for family with children to stay.

Also very generous with toiletries e.g. razor, toothbrush, hairbrush, cotton pads etc. Only comment I have is that the single bed I had was slightly ""sunken"" in, most likely due to the wear and tear of the spring. The location of the hotel is very central, 5 mins walk to the main Ginza shopping area where you can find almost everything, including the largest Uniqlo and department stores e.g. matsuya, mitsukoshi, which have designer and local brands. You can also buy local and international food from their depachikas (basement supermarkets). Down the road from the hotel (approx. 1 min or less), you'll find McDonalds (i think it's 24 hours) and Lawson convenience store.

The location, in the midst of Ginza district, is convenient for (overpriced) shopping and (must visit) Kabuki.And now, a couple of bad things that overrule the above mentioned.1. The attitude of the reception and service personel is pretty disturbing. One late morning, before going out, we had some questions to ask, so we went to the reception. There were 5~6 people behind the small reception counter chatting happily. When we entered the area, no one greeted us,but instead the chatting kept on and we were havily stared. We felt like we were disturbing a little meeting or something and they acted like we were disturbing.2. This morning, we couldn't connect to Wi-Fi. My partner called up to the reception, but the girl who took the phone didn't understand a thing (or seem). She called us back a minute later said ""You mean you can't get into the hotel?"" Hello! she can see who's calling and besides, she was calling to the room!! 3. At the breakfast restaurant, the waiter were greeting people with a very loud voice, soundedlike a screaming match! Such a rude way in the early morning. Also, the place was a total chaos, servers were hectic, food buffet was a complete joke, a disaster for the tongue. When you go there notice the best times for a relaxed breakfast in the tiny restaurant, somewhere between 7 and 8 o' clock. Nothing really to eat and they are chugging 2200 yen per person for...nothing. French cuisine? Lough out loud! Bed, too soft. Bathroom, somewhat small.

Fortunately, most areas have easy access to the excellent (albeit potentially confusing) subway system. Thus, don't be deterred by a Ginza hotel unless you're looking for local night life - Shibuya or Shinjuku offer much more at night. The Ginza is a high end shopping area that some might find slightly sterile. However, walks along the side streets will lead you to some excellent and affordable restaurants.I was very pleased with the hotel - it was clean, quiet, and the staff excellent. I was even more impressed by the price given that Tokyo is among the most expensive cities and I paid less than I would for a mid-tier hotel in most major US cities.The hotel has a small reception area along with a breakfast area (too pricey for me at around $17 US) and a french restaurant that I assume is a homage to the hotel chain's roots.The rooms are small but not uncomfortably so. The bathroom was more than adequate. I especially enjoyed the shower which had incredible water pressure and a toilet fitted with a ""shower,"" bidet and heated seat. For most of your electronics, you won't need a converter (Western plugs and a 100w current works for most laptops, phone chargers, etc.)I believe no room has a king size bed but check first - I could be wrong. The Mercure Ginza is located near the Yurakucho subway line; however, you more likely walk five minutes to access either the Hibaya or Ginza lines which provide easier access to popular districts and attractions. There are several convenience stores (think 7/11), fast food restaurants (including the very close and highly popular McDonald's plus good beef bowel, sushi, and tempura restaurants) and chain coffee shops near the hotel. The reception staff will provide maps and directions.If you're coming from the Narita airport, I found the easiest way of getting to the hotel is to take the express train (you'll find the counter to buy tickets just outside of customs) to Tokyo station and from there, grab a taxi for the short ride to the hotel.

We had a Deluxe Twin room and they were very comfortable beds, good pillows, nice sized bathroom with a bath and a good shower (over the bath), a desk, comfy chairs with foot stools, a fridge and tea/coffee making facilities.Finding the door to Reception is tricky as it is on the first floor (Floor 2 in Japanese or American terms). The entrance to the street is marked with an awning which is easy enough to find but when you enter that there is nothing but a lift and stairs. Take the lift to Floor 2 and you will find Reception and the Restaurant.The location is good, just around the corner to the (expensive) shops of Ginza with their neon lights but only a short walk (or a subway ride) to other areas such as the Yurakucho station area where there are much cheaper shops and local food stalls. The hotel is above the Ginza-itchome subway station so if it is raining you don't even have to go outside, however it is only a short walk to the A13 exit of the Giza subway station which is on a more convenient train line as it will take you to Tokyo station or Shinjuku station without having to change trains. The subway is very easy to use and we used it all the time to explore the city and beyond.For getting little things or snacks there is a McDonalds right near the door and a Starbucks and a Family Mart around the corner. The hotel restaurant is very nice (French) and serves a good breakfast (though surprisingly they couldn't make a decent omelet). It's a little pricey for dinner but serves beautiful food. If you like Yakitori just walk to the local Yakitori stalls under the rail lines near the Yurakucho station (you can also just walk down into the Ginzo station and come back up via the C1 exit and you're nearly there). Beautiful local food at food stall prices.All-in-all a good hotel and the staff were great.","Melbourne, Australia","Bruce M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",86,5.0

Firstly, due to a convention in TYO, many hotels were fully booked, Mercure itself were quite full, but upon writing to Kamel, he and his reservation team did their best to get me 2 rooms for my colleague and I. As a platinum member, I was allocated a deluxe room which by Japanese standards, it was spacious and very practical. In fact, I think it is larger by most Japanese standards. Room was clean and internet speed was fast. LCD TV was a bit small but manageable, most of the channels are in Japanese anyway. Lack of international channels like Fox or Star Movies but no issues for me as I spend most of my time away from the room.Breakfast was excellent with a mix of both Continental and Japanese fare, it was delicious and good way to start your day. Location wise, it is very accessible, 7min walk to JR Yamanote loop line and smack in the middle of Ginza shopping belt.

This was done with ease every morning free of charge, just like all other hotels around the world do. The 3 male waiters were extremely friendly every morning, until the last morning where a young waitress who will remain nameless, we'll call her Miss S, I asked her for the 2 fried eggs like every morning and was told very sternly 'No, you can not order that as it's the weekend and the kitchen is too busy' (it was a Friday btw and at that time was less busy then previous days) Instead of causing a scene I walked up to the young male waiter (who was in charge that day instead of the normal restaurant manager) this is the same waiter who the previous morning greeted us with '2 fried eggs again?' with a big smile. Well today he even changed his tune. As i asked him about the fried eggs, Miss S was shaking her head 'No' to him. Even though he was meant to be in charge he was taking orders from her and then informed us we must order the fried eggs off the A'la carte menu and pay for it. I asked to speak to the hotel manager, he made a phone call and then all of a sudden it was ok to get the fried eggs. This is a condensed version, this was actually a 15min saga before our fried egg request was approved.Silly things like this should not happen, you can't offer something for 3 days then say No on your 4th day. Lucky it was our last day there as it would of been very uncomfortable to go back. Both Miss S and the young waiter did apologise. Also on the last morning they had no bread for the toaster as the bread was not delivered?? They should send someone down to the closest supermarket and buy 20 loaves of bread. The pastries here are world class though. Just a little side note, we are also Gold Accor members so normally get treated with great hospitality from the Accor chain, unfortunately not this time.

But that as French as this place becomes. Once settled in the room, the decor and bathroom is a mix of continental/Japanese. I find the hotel to provide extremely good value for money, given it's excellent location near Tokyo central station and Ginza at it's doorsteps. Having said so, the rooms look very tired with an outdated decor, no comfy beds and are in serious need of renovation, at least in my eyes. In fact, the entire hotel could stand in for a major overhaul. I asked for a high floor room deluxe room and got it, thanks! However, I failed to ever understand the difference between superior and deluxe category rooms (except free bottle of water and wifi) and had expected something more of my deluxe room, even felt cheated. Browsing at the hotel website, the deluxe room appeared to look just the same like superior category. Again, given the Mercure's very ideal location, in an otherwise very expensive city, the price/value mix is reasonable, and thus the hotel is a great choice if you're on a budget, but nothing more. Front desk service is quick, efficient and with a smile. Overall, staff is very friendly and helpful at the Mercure Ginza, no faults there. Breakfast area was disappointing, but nearby Starbucks (just outside) and other small eateries easily made up for this shortfall. Sadly that the Mercure Ginza hotel is the only choice (apart from one Ibis) in this great city, offered by the Accor hotel chain, given this particular hotel's outdated state.

As I usually prefer to stay at the Sofitel brand, I found the room quite small, even for one person., but apparently this is usual for Tokyo . However it had everything I needed. I had issues connecting my Ipad to the free wifi, but it was quickly sorted out by a technician who came to my room. I felt the instructions could have been clearer re step 2 for novices like myself.I found all of the staff very friendly and helpful and was impressed with the number of languages they spoke and the level of English. I particularly enjoyed the food in the restaurant, for both breakfast and dinner. At times the service was poor, for example one evening when I was one of only two people dining, I waited for a long time before having to ask for a dessert menu. But then they surpassed themselves by providing a fresh fruit plate that was not on the menu. Also at breakfast, it seemed that every time I went to get something, it was in need of replenishment. Maybe more staff are needed at busy times. The pastries were delicious and tasted almost as good as those in France! The other comment I want to make is about the company policy of asking guests to leave their towels hanging on the hook if they want to help the environment and not have them replaced. Every morning I did this, but my towels were still replaced. Also, after a 4 night stay, I had 14 bottles of shampoo/conditioner in my bathroom! If it hasn't been used, then don't leave more every day!! It seems that staff need further training on how to comply with company policy and to respect guests' wishes in this regard.The location of this hotel was fantastic, close to great shopping, several railway stations and beautiful Christmas illuminations.

I see the Mercure brand as something that is not a budget brand but not the luxury brand either. This hotel however seemed to be to be in the budget category. The hotel seems very dated. You arrive in a very small and darkly decorated lobby area and are greeted with two lifts and some stairs. After a while you work out that you need to get into one of the lifts to get to reception. Unfortunately you have to magic your heavy suitcases and yourself into the lift within a few split seconds before the doors shut on you. When you arrive upstairs to the reception floor, again, it seems like a rather dark, dated decor. You check in and as I was checking in with the receptionist, the reception area was suddenly inundated with what seemed like a coach party of people talking loudly and virtually stampeding their way around you at all angles. We found our way through these people to go to our room, the dreaded lift again which took off before I had time to insert my card and select the floor. We arrived to the floor and again were greeted by some dark decor with no daylight, a long narrow corridor down to our room. The room was tiny and that was when I was thinking, this was meant to be a Superior Room. Bear in mind we had 3 weeks away from home so we had three weeks worth of luggage. There wasn't enough space to open up our two cases, so essentially we had to keep our clothes in our two cases and open them up one at a time on the bed everytime we wanted something out of them. The wardrobe was pretty small anyway with not enough space to hang up one persons clothes never mind two. We then decided to head down for dinner in the restaurant. We arrived down to the restaurant and looked and it looked very much like a roadside diner to us. I apprehensively walked in thinking we are going to have a bad dinner in here. That's when I started to think, this is more like an Ibis hotel, Ibis being a brand I class as low budget. However after experiencing the food and service in the restaurant I was pleasantly surprised, both the service and food were very good. This I class as the highlight of this hotel. The breakfasts in the morning where rather disappointing. You had to ask for cutlery, the milk had run out, so we had to ask for that and the bread rolls seemed as though they had been around for many days. There wasn't really anything inspiring or appetizing about the breakfast, to the point where we just didn't bother with it on our last day. Altogether a rather disappointing experience, the hotel needs an upgrade of decor and a more friendly greeting in the lobby area, rather than arriving and feeling completely disorientated and not knowing where reception is. In the lobby area my initial thought was, have we actually arrived in a hotel or have we walked through the wrong doorway and into an office block. It also needs bigger rooms because to me the room that we were in was certainly far from Superior.","Bolton, United Kingdom","Simon Y</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bolton, United Kingdom</strong>",109,3.0

It is a short walking from the Yurakucho Station and the walking is very very enjoyable because you are literally walking thru one of the busiest streets in Ginza. The central Tokyo Station is a little far away but still within walking distance. The property itself is a little bit off the street, which is a nice thing to keep you away from noise. One subway station is accessible from the underground pass during the day. And the hotel elevator directly takes you to the pass. The lobby is on the second floor and I like it! Being separated from the outside gives you a cozy and quiet feeling which wouldn't be the case if it was on the first floor.On the second two-day stay, we had breakfast there. The French chef always welcomed us with smiles and elegance. The food was typical continental style added with many Japanese breakfast varieties. Choices were abundant and every one of us loved it. After the first 2-day stay we needed to travel to Nagoya and Osaka so we asked the concierge if we could leave one of our baggage we didn't need to carry at the hotel. They gladly stored it away. When we came back it was already put into our room. talking about small details!As usual, Mercure hotel room was clean. I had expected a larger room since I was a Platinum mumber at Accor.

I just wish I could have found a few more affordable restaurants in the area.The hotel's subway entrance could use a bit of a renovation.

I was surprised to find that checkout time is 11am and they are very reluctant to extend it. After some talk they were willing to give until 12 noon, which is standard checkout time in all of Asia but in this case useless to me. To get past that even to 1pm was very difficult. I have a gold card but they flatly said I get no benefit with that. Most other hotel groups, also in Tokyo, give easily until 2pm and usually with a gold card until 4pm as long as they are not fully booked. And I only needed until 1pm this time. They wanted to charge 1000 yen for that extra hour, so clearly they had space, just wanted to be difficult and greedy. It is the small things that push customers away.

I insisted and then a copy was finally providedand it was in English. I further requested for a taxi leaving hotel to that station at 4 something. She was not happy. I was sad not because she did not know, but it was her attitude and unwilling to go further. She could simply check for customer those transfer details in Japanese. Obviously, she just did not do it.What was more, I kept thinking that there must have some sorts of transport or how local could get those morning flight. I later found out after surfing 30 mins in room and noted there was regularly coach leaving tokyo station. I then went to counter later than evening. This time, the trainee told they had nothing details but only one from TCAT. It was not responding to my needs but only lips service of what he had. Again, he was just not planning to help. I then further asked him to call the phone of the coach bus with my iPad as I won't speak Japanese. He refused and said it was a bit little as it was almost ten.

Still it served us well for the 6 nights that we stayed there as most of the time we were out sightseeing.The staff were very welcoming and helpful throught our stay. The only incident we had was with the 'space age' toilet/wc that we discovered are a 'feature' in Japan. You need a pilots license for these Japanese loos and one night ours would not stop continuous flushing, with me getting a full bidet spray in the face when I tried to fix it in the middle of the night, much to my wife's amusement. Aanyway I called reception who sent someone to fix it within minutes, with no problems thereafter...I recommend this hotel to anyone on a limited budget who wants to stay right in the heart of the shopping action - mind you if you're on a limited budget then you won't be shopping much here, the designer prices in Ginza require a mortgage extension..!!","Bunwell, United Kingdom","Propajob</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bunwell, United Kingdom</strong>",19,5.0

From there, it is easy to get to anywhere in Tokyo. 2 Lawson ( convenient store) on both ends of the hotel. 24 hr. Mc is on ground floor. Access from and to the airport is not very convenient if you have a big luggage. You either take the NEX then taxi or airport bus to Marriott Courtyard then taxi.Hotel - small access from ground floor to the small 2nd floor lobby. Ok decor.Room - small but not tiny, big for the price in Ginza. I booked a double for single use and I felt comfortable in the room. Since it is in the center so there's no nice view even from my room on the top floor, just the wall of the opposite side building. Nice decor, very functional with everything you need, very clean, the safe is big enough for iPad. Free wifi.Staff - polite and willing to help as all in the Japanese hotels I've been to, no problem using English, they booked my friends and me (5) a cheaper taxi to Narita than the one in the internet.

The room was nice with a pleasant Japanese feel to the decor and I had a decent nights sleep. Rooms were comparatively spacious from the others I experienced in Japan. The hotel did not have room service but did have a European buffet in the bar area. The buffet is not too bad but best for when you don't want to venture too far, otherwise venture out into Tokyo. Staff were characteristically lovely and welcoming.Overall the hotel is good and I would recommend it, however its worth noting that Ginza is a very experience part of Tokyo and we rapidly found that bar bills of £100 for a couple of rounds of drinks (couple of pints, couple of shots) was pretty standard (pints in the £15 each or so).

And, the location of this hotel in Ginza is very good.The problem was the room. The Mercure Ginza's website shows two different rooms and offers two room choices - superior (standard) or deluxe. The room photos did not offer any other information to identify the room types. It is reasonable to assume that the photos were of these two types. I chose a deluxe room and paid the additional fee for it (bringing the cost to around AUD$300 a night). However, on arrival, we were shown to a tiny, totally unappealling room. I returned to reception and was advised that the photo of the better room on the website was actually the suite, of which there is only one in the hotel, not offered to foreigners, and was not available. So, why are the room photos of it on the website??? If the photos of the lesser room were the 'deluxe' room, than the website was not showing any photos of the standard 'superior' rooms.We were moved to another marginally bigger and better laid out room but it was still subfar below expectation. As far as I can tell, the superior and deluxe rooms are not different (other than some nominal differences one expects due to floor layouts). The extra charge for a ""deluxe"" room is for wifi (which should be free anyway and fell out constantly) and for the inclusion of an acceptable but mediocre breakfast. The promise on the website of international TV channels (BBC, CNN, and TV5) turned out to only be a not very clear BBC World. No CNN, no TV5.I again reitierate that the staff were wonderful. The hotel was clean, the bed comfortable, and would ahve been acceptable if one was expecting a standard 3 star hotel.

We have a 7 year old and we didn't want to be sleeping in a small Tokyo hotel room, all over each other. But he's too small to have his own room, so connecting rooms were perfect! And the price was affordable (for Tokyo). They connect a queen with a twin room, so you get a good sized double bed in one room and two large singles in the other. You could accommodate a family of four comfortably. The hotel is in a great neighbourhood. Just on the cusp of posh Ginza, so great shopping (or window shopping) abounds. We took the airport limousine, which dropped us off at Tokyo Station, about a 5 minute walk away. But we got a wee bit lost getting there because streets have no names!! Thank goodness for the smart-phone GPS. It's a business hotel really, but you won't feel out of place because lots of people have cottoned on to it as a nicely located, affordable hotel. The reception staff were very nice and spoke English well. The rooms were really good. Small by international standards, but well designed. Take compact luggage to Japan, it's easier to store and to move around. Having two rooms meant we could wedge the door open and voila! A mini apartment! The bathrooms had a touch of Japan about them; screen door, spray toilet, deep bath, baskets for clothes; but all well designed and as always - efficient. The decor was nice - but it's a shame the wall paper is an English country scene when it could be Japan! But never mind, it was scrupulously clean, with just a few scuff marks on the walls. Each room had a mini fridge (with a few snacks you could buy), hot water kettle, a few tea sachets, glasses and cups/saucers. No microwave, which would have been good. Your room includes breakfast, but we were getting up early and wanted to eat brekkie in our PJ's so we bought delicious croissants every evening from the Lawsons across the road, along with mini- jams and butter, and ate them with a cuppa tea at our desk/table in comfort every morning! We ate dinner in the neighborhood, or at Tokyo Station - all the stations in Tokyo have fabulous restaurants in them. One night we walked the streets, on a gorgeous balmy evening, going down all the side streets in Ginza looking for a restaurant, and for some reason we couldn't find one that suited. We turned left down a tiny street, then right, then took two lefts and were thoroughly (but happily) lost when we found a cheap and cheerful noodle house, with champon and chanton (bowls of noodles with veges and meat if you want). We had a great meal, and then left, fully expecting to use the GPS to get home to the hotel, and what did we find? The Mercure was just a few metres down the road!! One more thing about the room. We were there for 4 nights. When we left, I stuffed a bag of bathroom toiletries in my luggage to take home. When I weighed it at home, it was nearly 2kg!

While the price was mid range, it was still less than what we have paid in lesser hotels. The facilities and room appointment were clean and comfortable. The breakfast selection was very good with both hot and cold as well as western and Japaneses choices. The rooms have small minibars but there is sufficient space in the refrigerator to store your own stuff. Despite being the middle of summer, the airconditioning was very effective.The location was very convenient with major Department stores only a short walk away. Despite the location, there are a number of comvenience stores close to the hotel allowing you to dine on the cheap if you want. Fast food outlets including Macdonalds and Starbucks are within a stone's throw of the hotel as well as a huge variety of restaurants.It is easy to get around as it is close to the subway. To reach the hotel from Tokyo station, just take the Yamanote line one stop to YurakuchoJR station then follow the signs to the Yurakucho subway station on the Yurakuchu line. Catch the subway one stop to Ginza Ichachome then follow the signs to exit 11. There you will see a door leading into the Mercure without having to go up onto the street. A word of warning though.

It's in a great location in Ginza, with a wide array of restaurants and convenience stores nearby, and some fast food options close too. It's literally around the corner from the main Ginza shopping street where you'll find stores like Tiffany & Co, Chanel, Prada etc along with several Japanese Department stores. The food halls in these Department stores are well worth a look as they seem to offer everything from simple (but outstanding) sushi to amazing cakes and sweets.As other reviewers have stated there is a subway station accessible under the hotel but it only provides access to the Yurakucho line which is of limited value to tourists unless you want to visit the Imperial Palace. For better subway options a short walk to either the Ginza station where you can access 3 different and very useful subway lines or the Higashi-Ginza station where you can access 2 lines including the Asakusa line are better options.The facilities in the Mercure are fairly basic for a hotel of this price bracket. There is no gym or pool, nor a business centre. It does have a small but functional reception area and a restaurant & bar. Wired internet access is provided in each room with wi-fi only available in the reception and surrounding area. (We rented a portable 4g Wifi device for our stay in Japan and this proved to be very convenient and useful.) There are ice machines located on each floor.The rooms we had were small, with one slightly larger than the other, but with space at such a premium in Tokyo we were not surprised. The rooms provided all that we needed with a small mini-bar fridge, desk, television and nice bathroom. They were spotlessly clean and the staff at the Mercure kept them that way throughout our stay.The reception staff were excellent, and the ones that we encountered all spoke good English. They were helpful and efficient, providing good advice and directions when needed.

Room size was good when compared to most other hotels in Tokyo. Can't really say much about the view as we were looking out at the building next door (on the 4th floor).One complaint would be that a space right next to the hotel entrance doors have been designated as a smoking space (Ginza is generally a non-smoking area) so it's rather unpleasant for non-smokers when walking past this area to get to the hotel doors.The front desk staff were helpful and fluent in English.","Jakarta, Indonesia","OliK75</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jakarta, Indonesia</strong>",49,4.0

The rooms are very small (maybe large per Japanese standards?), and the amenities/decorations in the hotel and rooms are not more than average as well. As far as location goes - when you are coming to Tokyo for business for a very short stay, is the location really that important? Although a big city, the transporation system of Tokyo is so good, you are probably within a half hour away from wherever you want to be. Then the question is - is the area of the hotel - being the Ginza area, really so great? Yes, there are a lot of very fancy brand shops very close by, but is that what one is looking for in the short free time one has.

It is excellently located in Ginza, which is a very upmarket area of Tokyo. It is centrally located and therefore it is easy to get to any of the sights in Tokyo from here. There is a subway station in the basement, however this is not on a very convenient line. There are two other subway stations very close by, Ginza is the most convenient. It is so close that we actually walked there with our luggage when it came time to go home, and the information boards in Ginza Station tell you in English which exit you need to use to get to the hotel. All of this means that what ever sights you have decided you want to see in Tokyo, they are easy to get to from here. Just so you know here is some of what we visited and roughly how long it took from the hotel door, Disneyland - about 30 minutesSenso-Ji Temple - about 20 minutesShibyua - About 20 minutesso as you can see nowhere is really going to be more than about a 45 minute subway ride away. There are a couple of local 7/11 type shops near by which sell water and coke, sweets etc, which are cheaper than the mini bar, there is a Mcdonalds next door, and a few very good coffee shops/cafes in the street the hotel is in. In the next few streets are plenty of eating and drinking spots. The staff at the hotel recommended a sushi bar to us which was fantastic, it was called Bikkuri Sushi Ginza and I definitely recommend eating thee at least once.The room itself was very nice, it was clean and well appointed, not that big, but then you are in the centre of Tokyo so what do you expect. The bathroom was very clean and well appointed, the most advanced toilet I have ever seen!! It had a dial to change the temperature of the seat!There was free internet via a provided ethernet cable in the room and free wifi in the lobby. We didnt eat at the restaurant, breakfast or dinner, because there are so many other good spots to eat around, so I can't comment on the food. Just so you know who is submiting this reveiw, we are not backpackers, we do not stay at hostels, we like to stay at very nice private hotels.

The other main complaint with this hotel is that the reception is not on the ground floor as you enter, but you need to take a lift up to the second floor. The room I got had two beds in it, so had very little free space and the reception staff described this to me as a free upgrade, but I'd have preferred a room with only one bed and more space to open my luggage out in.

To recommend these rooms as comfortable depends very much if you are traveling alone or together. I would think of these rooms as single person rooms no matter if there are double rooms in the offering; two pieces of luggage represent an issue because there is very limited storage capacity in the room and space around beds is very limited too.None of the rooms have a view, most of them are looking at the Tokyo race authorization building or its neighboring building, both not worth to have a look at at all.If plans are to hang out in the city all day this hotel is a very good choice of hotel because it sits on top of a subway station Ginza Ichome. Breakfast, dinner and coffee places all over. Tokyo central at the doorstep of the hotel, it's all right there as soon as you leave the ground floor entry.But when you are dependable of the hotel facilities my recommendation would be different; go and look further.Hotel staff is pleasant and helpful; breakfast is extended continental and sufficient but it does feel like you are in Paris instead of Tokyo. That is to be expected though from this chain of hotels. Some staff speaks French too, English language use is common for all.All in all, when you are looking for a luxury hotel with associated facilities do not go here. If you are looking for good international standards without frills and whistles, cleanliness, pleasant staff, perfect location to explore Tokyo (central) and a good price this hotel needs to be on your shortlist.","Capelle aan den IJssel, The Netherlands","hans_hasselbach</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Capelle aan den IJssel, The Netherlands</strong>",34,4.0

Calling my reaction disappointment would be an understatement. (When I discovered that I was paying more than the rack rate on their website, I was further annoyed, but that has to do with my poor homework on Priceline prices, not the hotel itself.)As it happened, my disappointment was mitigated by a few things. If you're shopping or working in Ginza, the location is ideal and the price is considerably less than the average for such a posh neighborhood. The room, while not spacious, was a decent size, with an almost big bathroom. Staff was helpful, efficient and professional, was knowledgeable about the city and spoke English well (French seemed to be more of a challenge). Check in and out were quick. Tokyo and Shimbashi Stations are close on foot or by cab, metro and private line trains from Ginza station are even closer, and there is direct access to Ginza Itchome station from the basement level if that line in of use to you. But in the end, it was a standard-issue Mercure, not a luxurious Sofitel. I know that is stating the obvious, but I was hoping for something a little better, given the stars and the neighborhood.

It's a great location for starters and right on the subway if that's helpful. The rooms are smallish; but the bathroom about the same size as a Tower room at The Imperial. The room was very clean and tidy, the bed comfortable. Effective and quiet (stress quiet) air-conditioning, and free wi-fi. The buffet breakfast at 1,900 Yen was rather pedestrian - so skip that and go to one of the many coffee shops in the area (and there a many in neighboring streets, including a 24 Hr McDonald's next door). Also close are small shops for supplies of bottled water (e.g. Lawsons). Reception were helpful and competent; and there were even copies of the International Herald Tribune on every floor in the morning (you only get that on the more expensive floors of The Imperial).

HotelChoose accomodation central to places you intend to visit. Tokyo is a flat, good-pavement lined city but don't bother with fashion footwear. Ginza is a good option for shopping and restaurants, do expect to pay more for smaller room with fewer inclusions (no gym/pool/wifi/cable) but it doesn't matter if you spend little time there.2. ShoppingBrilliant with wide selection of local and international labels, remember to bring passport on person to enable tax-backs too. Salespersons are bilingual and very helpful,tax-free goods bonus for travellers. Best stores Isetan, Mitsukoshi, Matsuya, Barneys New York.3. Food is a major part of traveling for me, and I recommend eat mostly Japanese- style when you can. Sashimi wonderful, as is most Japanese cuisine. Tip for travellers: if on budget, buy prepackaged Japanese-style food from 24hr convenience stores; tasty, fresh, clean, wide variety, healthy and cheap. Fusion style offerings, even at high end restaurants don't really translate very well- best avoided.3. ToursBook in advance to get best rates, work out pickup points for tours to avoid confusion on day. Do visit many tourist hot spots like Mt Fuji and Hakone, choose weekday to avoid crowds.4. Tokyo is easy town to navigate on foot, and the metro-and rail lines are efficient and fast. Card machines in English, easy to top up. Best places to visit are Ueno Park for zoo, shrines and museums, Yoyogi Park for beautiful gardens and shrines, Akihabara for electronics, manga and games, Shibuya for shopping, Harajuku for fashion and people watching (recommend weekends) and Shinjuku for daytime shopping and nighttime bars, Pachinko and colorful nightlife.Tips for travellersTokyo very safe for foreigners, on streets and trains, but expect stares particulary at night on train if you're female. Have cash on you, most store purchases, even by locals are transacted in cash. Difficult to locate an ATM that actually took my card. Don't eat/drink when walking, or blow nose with tissue in public. My camera was stolen on my last day by a pickpocket on a train- in hindsight, put belongings away in a bag and secure/zip up bag at all times and be wary of fellow commuters who sit close/inadvertently bump into you.

We asked for a non-smoking room and I was disappointed to find on my first stay that the room was still very smoky and airless, but on the return trip found a much cleaner and nicer atmosphere although room type was no different, just different floor. The staff were helpful although their knowledge of local events such as a major Picasso visiting exhibition was very limited but they were willing to search. Everything is pricy in Japan so the hotel is no bargain but again its location more than compensated in its proximity to the train station and fast food restaurants should you need a caffeine fix. Beds were comfortable but typically hard Asian mattresses. Breakfasts were good and the time was generous on the weekends although the Japanese are sticklers for punctuality so no lingering over those croissants or noodles! It was also pleasing to see that Western and Asian tastes were adequately catered for. In spite of its downtown location it wasn't too noisy and I appreciated the fact that they could accomodate late check-out within reason and would mind your luggage and hail a cab for return to the station.

However, the breakfast each morning was by far the best part of this hotel. I ate 3 or 4 plates of delicious bacon, eggs and fresh pastries each day and only needed a light snack later in the afternoon to tide me over saving myself hundreds of dollars in food costs. The hotel was in a great area of Ginza - close to subways and a lot of interesting sites.

The hotel itself was very nice - clean (as is everything in Japan), friendly, all the employees I spoke with were fluent in English (i didn't realize just how rare this is prior to my visit), and in close proximity to a subway line (though one that never went where I was going), 2 Lawsons convenience stores and a McDonalds (all 24 hours). I did not spend much time in the hotel itself (other than to sleep), so I can't speak much of the services provided (restaurant, room service, fitness center, etc), except to say that I enjoyed the free in-room internet access (LAN not wifi).The hotel is convenient to Tokyo station, which is great if you are coming from Narita. It's about a 20 min walk (if you don't get lost!) so technically doable in good weather without luggage; alternatively, the cab ride cost me about 900Y. Based on another TA review, I contacted the hotel prior to arrival for directions that I was able to print and give to the cab driver - I highly recommend this to anyone staying here, as even with the map, the driver had to refer to it a couple times and circle the block once to find the hotel. It is also convenient to plenty of shopping and dining options, the Imperial Palace (walking distance), the Maranouchi line for traveling to Shinjuku (about 20 min), and the Ginza line for Shibuya/Harajuku (about 20 min) in one direction or Akihabara, Ueno, or Asakusa in the other (20 min or less). Despite all the above, I probably would not stay here on my next trip to Tokyo without a similar deal on price, but only because the location was not close to the sites I was most interested in, esp. the nightlife. Although I always felt very safe in Tokyo, as a solo female traveler, I prefer to have a hotel in the area where I will be at night (just to be clear, I'm not using the term ""nightlife"" to refer to all-night clubbing. The subways in Tokyo stop around midnight (the time varies slightly by line), and it always took me a few tries to find the right subway line and walk to the entrance (the stations are massive in Tokyo), so I would have to be headed to the subway no later than 11:30p, which sometimes made dinners feel rushed. The alternative would have been a 2,800Y cab ride back to Ginza).

Tokyo is very expensive so and I got a reasonable rate (120 USD per night) at this hotel as I booked early. Here are the main problems:1. Hotel structure is ridiculously cheap - you can hear EVERYTHING that goes on on the rooms above and beside yours. I made several complaints to the staff and they did not do anything about it. This went of for 3 nights and seriously spoiled my stay as having a quiet full night sleep is impossible here.2. Staff is poorly trained, I don;t know what other guests that posted reviews here saw in this staff. They speak little English (and trust me, basic English is spoken everywhere in Tokyo, specially brand hotels) and have no power to help us in anything besides suggesting some average restaurants and saying hello and goodbye.3. Bar and restaurant are, to say the least. sad. Don't waste your time not even checking it out. I had received two courtesy drinks (which in Accor Hotels usually mean any drink) and as I was claiming the drink, I learned that I could have a soft drink or a beer. A courtesy drink is now a Coke?!?!?!?! Pitiful.Anyway.... there were so many other smaller problems that I think everyone should know that this hotel is not that great. Rooms are clean and location is OK (there are several good locations in Tokyo and this is by far not the coolest) but that is about it. If you pay a bit more, you can go for a 4/5 star hotel that will treat you right.

When we left Tokyo ecaught the TCAT bus to the terminal which was really straight forward and easy. The hotel booked us 4 seats which we paid for at the hotel and were given vouchers. We caught 2 taxis to the TCAT terminal and traded the vouchers for tickets. At our departure time there were plenty of seats on the bus and the trip took about an hour straight to Terminal 2. We had a Tokyo Free Guide on the first day of our stay which was marvellous! Having a guide helped us orientate ourselves and we learnt how to use the subway system so that on day 2 we were able to get around ourselves.

We did have a couple of hassles and they were nothing to do with the hotel. First one was we caught the airport express train into Tokyo station and bought a coke on the train and it cost A$10, we knew it was expensive in Tokyo but that was rediculous but soon realised it was just on the train as the thousands of vending machines where only about A$2. The only other problem was we found the taxi rank after a little searching at Tokyo station and no one knew where the Mecure was, I had printed out the name etc of the website but I think because it was in english he didnt understand and then he asked his supervisor and it took about 15mins before we got going and then got to Ginza and he just kept driving around until my mother saw the sign and we found it, so suggest you check the exact address & phone number to show the driver. Otherwise great trip, We did hire a private guide for just the 2 of us for the day and that was great, we saw so much and really covered a lot of area in a short amount of time. Only suggest a couple of days in Tokyo then get out into the real Japan.","Gold Coast, Australia","Kookie8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast, Australia</strong>",39,4.0

You will not have someone to carry bags or wait on you hand and foot in your room.

The Subway is at the end of the street (50 meters) or you can jump the JR line with another 2 minutes walk. Ginza Dori is only 2 short blocks away for a little shopping. Tokyo station (take the Narita Express in from the airport to here) is only 700 yen by taxi, door to door.The rooms are small, but not by Japanese standards. They are welll fitted out and pleasant on the eye, not to mention, spotlessly clean of course. Free internet in the rooms is standard (are you listening Paris!!!), as are the local English newspapers.The staff were fantastic - all spoke good English, knew the area well and were only too happy to recommend restaurants, nightlife and touring spots. They also helped on the phone talking to the taxi driver so he could find the place from Tokyo station! Good food is available all around the area and you need only walk 10 paces before another Izakaya or food store comes into view from the hotel's front door.

Price - I'm an Accor Advantage Plus member and I booked the room on their prepaid plan (no refunds) and paid less than 11,000 Yen per night (including tax). Best thing is that because it was prepaid, my credit card was charged about 6 months ago - when the Yen was much lower, compared to my Singaporean dollar. Altogether it costed about SGD160 per night. Oh yeah, I used my free night's stay for the 2nd night. Weird thing is that they have different rates for different nights.2. Location - Ginza Itchome subway station is linked to the hotel by an underpass. Very convenient for me. But note, the walk from the actual subway gate is about 3-4 minutes, and there are about 3 flights of stairs in all - not wheelchair accessible. McDonalds is just next door.

The hotel is located in a side a side street and after getting into a cab at Tokyo station it was soon clear that our cab driver (and another one he asked for directions) didn’t know where the hotel was. I suppose it didn’t help that the taxi driver was not just unable to understand the map, he was in fact drunk, but that’s another story. If you are getting a cab then see if you can get the address of the hotel in Japanese. After the first day it was clear that the best option was the metro and the hotel has a basement entrance from the station.My room was of a decent standard, clean and functional. It was fine for me on a weeks visit however had I brought more luggage or had my wife with me then things would have been a bit cramped and storage would have been a problem, however from reading reviews on other hotels space seems to be an issue at most of the reasonably priced hotels. Plenty of complimentary toiletries were supplied along with adequate tea, coffee and a morning newspaper. The air conditioning system was easy to operate, responsive and most of all quiet. Because of the hotels location it is very quiet at night and unless you are on the top floors not much of a view from the windows. I only had breakfast once at the hotel and it was fine but there are so many decent coffee shops around the hotel (Starbucks and a local chain Dotour) it’s cheaper to eat out. The reception staff were fine and my wife had no problems at all getting through when calling from the UK. I had some laundry done during my stay and that wasn’t as expensive as I thought but there is a huge hike in the price for Sundays and public holidays.Some points to note. If you want an early check in confirm with the hotel first, I did and still had to wait until exactly (and I mean exactly) 2pm before being given my pass card. There are also a number of smoking rooms so book ahead to avoid these. There is only one laptop with internet access for general use and although free there did tend to always be a wait and it wasn’t private as you would have people waiting behind you whilst you read your e mails.On the whole a good stay with no problems in a great central location.","Colchester, United Kingdom","JTS-7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colchester, United Kingdom</strong>",30,4.0

Our clients booked the room for us, based on their knowledge of the area. We agree with the other reviews -- the Mercure is very nice and in a great location. Getting to check-in can be a bit of a challenge. We found that the best approach for the money is to take the Limousine Bus service from the airport to Tokyo Station. The bus service handled all of our bags for us, without our having to negotiate stairs or escalators; then we put our bags directly on a taxi at Tokyo Station. The taxi from Tokyo bus/train station to the hotel was quick and inexpensive. Hotel Reception is on the second floor, so managing the bags into the elevator was cumbersome. A luggage trolly is available in reception, and hotel staff will convey your luggage for you. Internet connection was $9 per day via ethernet.

Our plan from the airport was to buy a Narita Express + Suica card package at the JR Office at Narita Station. The N'Ex ticket got us to Tokyo Main Station plus a transfer to Yurakucho Station. We then planned to use our Suica cards to get the subway to Ginza Ichome right under the hotel. Unfortunately the escalators ran out at Yurakucho, and we had to lug cases down stairways. At that point we took a taxi. In retrospect, taking a taxi from Tokyo Main Station would have been straightforward and no more expensive, as it is not far from the Mercure.The Mercure has a small but functional reception area and a good breakfasting restaurant. The rooms have pretty much all you need, Nicely furnished, flat screen telly, electric toilet. However our room was so narrow, and had one very small wardrobe and virtually no drawers. My wife used the wardrobe, and I pretty much lived out of my case. However hotels, like most things in life, are a compromise. You can put up with a lot for the location in the heart of Ginza, with department stores, restaurants and coffee shops all around.The Imperial Palace Gardens are a pleasant stroll away, and with the subway station under the hotel you can get most places quickly.We booked a coach trip to Fuji from hotel reception, and were picked up the next morning.

The rooms are clean, small, yet extra-efficient. Paying just a bit more for the next size up (a few square feet more and still small) was certainly worthwhile, and we only had one suitcase. There is not much of a view, but the almost perfect location more than compensates for that. Just a hop (by foot or cab ride) to the Tokyo JR Yamanote line station and hops to 2 or 3 subway stations with access to the rest of the city (Ginza station was invariably the most useful). The single most important aspect of this hotel’s location though is the walking distance proximity to the Tsukiji fish market—best visited at 5:00am, the perfect antidote to jet lag for the American or European visitor!The breakfast is not fantastic but still OK and convenient to have readily available before heading out on a long day. And, certainly good coffee is on offer—what else would you expect from the French. As an alternative, Starbucks is around the corner, if you happen to be that type. The best culinary “secret” though is the food court in the basement of the next-door department stores, Takashiyama, Mitsukoshi, Matsuzakaya. Reasonably priced with a large variety of Japanese fair. No place to sit though—so takeaway is the deal! The service at the hotel is excellent.

The hotel had a french themed restaruant, which looked lovely and served breakfast, lunch and dinner but we didnt go in coz there were just so much to do away from the hotel it was just a bed and a base for us really. The hotel as got to be one of the best locations in tokyo, in the heart of ginza and the shopping heaven! very much like the heart of new york, the same atmosphere and busy-ness and great to experience the day to day life of a japanese business-person.

And on reflection is its apeal and charm but when its nearly midnight and you are struggling to find something to eat for dinner it can get you down! So my advice is to learn at least conversation japanese or to be able to read a menu in japanese to meet them halfway.After that slight drawback we still saw and experienced everything we wanted to and had the best honeymoon! A few bits and bobs about the city......go to tokyo bay, a beach and cafe's and boat trips are ace. The imperial palace is great, takes you away from the city and gives you a cultural insight to the city too. We also went to Ueno Park, which was lovely but much more touristy - the zoo was good and seeing the temple and pergoda was lovely. We got around on the metro everyday - and night - which was great, easy to use and from the hotel you have three different stations and about 6 different metro lines to choose from so you can get anywhere you want!

From the hotel, it is also a short walk to the other underground station which we took the train to Haneda airport for a flight to Hokkaido.We booked connecting rooms. Rooms are nice, clean and very small. Anyway, we understand that this is Ginza (the most expensive area of Tokyo). The most impressing thing about the hotel is its staffs. Before my trip started, I had booked a hotel in Hokkaido with one of the Japanese website which I used for the first time. I was not sure about the booking so I emailed Mercure Ginza asking for some suggestions. Without my request, one of the staff had called the hotel in Hokkaido and confirmed everything for us. This is really impressed me.

I read the reviews on this site and thought it was a good bet. When I booked it I strongly requested a non-smoking room.When we checked in I asked whether this had been honoured and the woman on the front desk assured me we were in a nonsmoking room on a non-smoking floor.We went to the room (on the 3rd floor) and everything was good. Clean, comfy bed, nice bathroom. The room is very small but adequate for 3 star. The next day however, things started to go bad. They only give you the bare minimum, one towel each, they don't replace the used shampoo and I had to ask for it. The TV has only 1 English channel (CNN). I am not there for the TV by any means but it is nice to watch a bit before going to sleep of a night. The worst however was that when we got back into the room on the second night it reeked of smoke! So much that went we both walked in we started coughing. We had been given a room that had a door into the next room. This was locked but I think the smoke was getting underneath the door or coming through the air-conditioning system, I am not sure.I rang up reception very confused as we had been told it was a nonsmoking floor and they said that no, I was in a smoking room on a smoking floor. When I said that obviously I had been told a lie then, they refused to acknowledge this or apologize. I requested another room and they said this was not possible. I asked for compensation of some kind and they said that was not possible either. In the end they gave me 1 hour later checkout. Not much good as far as I am concerned. We went out for dinner and they said they would come in and air out the room. When we came back it was a bit better, but could still smell the smoke. We were woken up though at about 6 am the next morning from the really strong smell of smoke. Obviously someone had got up pretty early in the room next to us. Now I understand that sometimes it is not possible to give everyone a non-smoking room, but if you are going to put non smokers into a smoking room you have to at least make sure that they are able to stay in there comfortably. It was so bad I developed a sore throat and had to leave the room.I will never be going back to this place and would not recommend it to anyone.",Hong Kong,"Miranda_L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",52,1.0

Three metro stations to choose from (I don't think we ever used the one in the basement) plus a stop on the JR Yamanote line about five minutes walk away. Ten minutes walk to the Tsukiji Fish market. We only tried the buffet breakfast once as it was quite expensive - you need to be very hungry for it to be worthwhile; it's more like a brunch. However on our other seven days there we had coffee and croissants or Danish in a different café every day. Do note that taxi drivers don't know this hotel and even their little Japanese map on the website doesn't help much. I ended up giving the driver instructions when we arrived the first day. I used to ask them to bring us to the Matsuya dept store and we would walk the rest of the way (two blocks, and Ginza blocks are much, much narrower than NY ones).
